Cusay will fly about the king desire exeunt 

courage you mighty man of Israel 
and charge your fatal instrument of war 
upon the bosom of proud Ammon son 
that have disguise your king ambassador 
cut half their beard and half their garment off 
in spite of Israel and his daughter son 
you fight the holy battle of jehova 
king David god and we and jacob god 
that guide your weapon to their conquer stroke 
order your footstep and direct your thought 
to stratagem that harbour victory 
he cast his sacred eyesight from on high 
and see your foe run seek for their death 
laugh their labour and their hope to scorn 
while betwixt your body and their blunt sword 
he put on armour of his honour proof 
and make their weapon wound the senseless wind 

before this city Rabath we will lie 
and shoot forth shaft as thick and dangerous 
as be the hail that Moses mix with fire 
and throw with fury round about the field 
devour Pharaoh friend and Egypt fruit 

first mighty captain joab and Abisay 
let we assault and scale this kingly tower 
where all their conduit and their fountain be 
then we may easy take the city too 

well have Urias counsel our attempt 
and as he speak we so assault the tower 
let Hannon now the king of Ammon son 
repulse our conquer passage if he dare 

what will the shepherd dog of Israel 
snatch from the mighty issue of king Ammon 
the valiant Ammon and haughty syrian 
it be not your late successive victory 
can make we yield or quail our courage 
but if you dare assay to scale this tower 
our angry sword shall smite you to the ground 
and venge our loss on your hateful life 

Hannon thy father Nahas give relief 
to holy David in his hapless exile 
live his fix date and die in peace 
but thou instead of reap his reward 
have tread it underfoot and scorn our king 
therefore thy day shall end with violence 
and to our sword thy vital blood shall cleave 

hence thou that bear poor Israel shepherd hook 
the proud lieutenant of that base bear king 
and keep within the compass of his fold 
for if you seek to feed on Ammon fruit 
and stray into the syrian fruitful Mede 
the mastiff of our land shall weary you 
and pull the weasel from your greedy throat 

who can endure these pagan blasphemy 

my soul repine at this disparagement 

assault you valiant man of David host 
and beat these rail dastard from their door 
thus have we win the tower which we will keep 
maugre the son of Ammon and of Syria 

where be lord joab leader of the host 

here be lord joab leader of the host 
Cusay come up for we have win the hold he come 

in happy hour then be Cusay come 

what news then bring lord Cusay from the king

to send he home Urias from the war 
for matter of some service he shall do 

it be for no choler have surprise the king 
I hope lord Cusay against his servant truth 

no rather to prefer Urias truth 

here take he with thou then and go in peace 
and tell my lord the king that I have fight 
against the city Rabath with success 
and scale where the royal palace be 
the conduit head and all their sweet spring 
then let he come in person to these wall 
with all the soldier he can bring beside 
and take the city as his own exploit 
lest I surprise it and the people give 
the glory of the conquest to my name 

we will lord joab and great Israel god 
bless in thy hand the battle of our king 

farewell Urias have away the king 

as sure as joab breathe a victor here 
Urias will haste he and his own return exeunt 

let we descend and open the palace gate 
take our soldier in to keep the hold 

let we Abisay and you son of juda 
be valiant and maintain your victory exeunt 

what mean my lord the king belove son 
that wear upon his right triumphant arm 
the power of Israel for a royal favour 
that hold upon the table of his hand 
banquet of honour and all thought content 
to suffer pale and grisly abstinence 
to sit and feed upon his faint cheek 
and suck away the blood that cheer his look 

ah jonadab it be my sister look 
on who sweet beauty I bestow my blood 
that make i look so amorous lean 
her beauty have seize upon my heart 
so merry consecrate to her content 
set now such guard about his vital blood 
and view the passage with such pierce eye 
that none can escape to cheer my pine cheek 
but all be think too little for her love 

then from her heart thy look shall be relieve 
and thou shall joy she as thy soul desire

since Thamar be a virgin and my sister 

thus it shall be lie down upon thy bed 
feign thou fever sick and ill at ease 
and when the king shall come to visit thou

to dress some dainty for thy malady 
then when thou have she sole with thyself 
enforce some favour to thy manly love 
see where she come entreat she in with thou 

what ail Ammon with such sickly look 
to daunt the favour of his lovely face 

sweet Thamar sick and wish some wholesome cate 
dress with the cunning of thy dainty hand 

that have the king command at my hand 
then come and rest thou while I make thou ready 
some dainty easeful to thy craze soul 

I go sweet sister ease with thy sight 

why shall a prince who power may command 
obey the rebel passion of his love 
when they contend but against his conscience 
and may be govern or suppress by will

that soak the courage from thy kingly heart 
and give it passage to thy wither cheek 
now Thamar ripen be the holy fruit 
that grow on plant of thy virginity 
and rot be thy name in Israel

as to contend with Ammon lusty arm 
sinew with vigour of his landless love 
fair Thamar now dishonour hunt thy foot 
and follow thou through every covert shade 
discover thy shame and nakedness 
even from the valley of jehosophat 
up to the lofty mount of Libanon 
where cedar stir with anger of the wind

tremble with fury and with murmur shake 
earth with their foot and with their head the heaven 
beat the cloud into their swift rack 
to bear this wonder round about the world Exit 

hence from my bed who sight offend my soul

cast as be Eva from that glorious soil 
where all delight sit bate wing with thought 
ready to nestle in her naked breast 
to bare and barren vale with flood make waste 
to desert wood and hill with lighten scorch 
with death with shame with hell with horror sit 
there will I wander from my father face 
there Absalon my brother Absalon 
sweet Absalon shall hear his sister mourn 
there will I live with my windy sigh 
night raven and owl to rend my bloody side 
which with a rusty weapon I will wound 
and make they passage to my pant heart 
why talk thou wretch and leave the deed undo 
rend hair and garment as thy heart be rend 
with inward fury of a thousand grief 
and scatter they by these unhallowed door 
to figure Ammon rest cruelty 
and tragic spoil of Thamar chastity 

what cause Thamar to exclaim so much 

the cause that Thamar shame to disclose 

say I thy brother will revenge that cause 

Ammon our father son have force i 
and thrust i from he as the scorn of Israel 

have Ammon force thou by David hand 
and by the covenant God have make with he 
Ammon shall bear his violence to hell 
traitor to heaven traitor to David throne 
traitor to Absalon and Israel 
this fact have jacob ruler see from heaven 
and through a cloud of smoke and tower of fire 
as he ride vaunt he upon the green 
shall tear his chariot wheel with violent wind 
and throw his body in the bloody sea 
at he the thunder shall discharge his bolt 
and his fair spouse with bright and fiery wing 
sit ever burn on his hateful bone 
myself as swift as thunder or his spouse 
will hunt occasion with a secret hate 
to work false Ammon a ungracious end 
go in my sister rest thou in my house 
and God in time shall take this shame from thou 

nor God nor time will do that good for i 

my Absalon what make thou here alone 
and bear such discontentment in thy brow 

great cause have Absalon to be displease 
and in his heart to shroud the wound of wrath 

against who shall Absalon be thus displease 

against wicked Ammon thy ungracious son 
my brother and fair Thamar by the king 
my stepbrother by mother and by kind 
he have dishonour David holiness 
and fix a blot of lightness on his throne 
force my sister Thamar when he feign 
a sickness spring from root of heinous lust 

have Ammon bring this evil on my house 
and suffer sin to smite his father bone 
smite David deadly than the voice of heaven 
and let hate fire be kindle in thy heart 
frame in the arch of thy angry brow 
make thy forehead like a comet shine 
to force false Ammon tremble at thy look 
sin with his sevenfold crown and purple robe 
begin his triumph in my guilty throne 
there sit he watch with his hundred eye 
our idle minute and our wanton thought 
and with his bait make of our frail desire 
give we the hook that hale our soul to hell 
but with the spirit of my kingdom god 
I will thrust the flatter tyrant from his throne 
and scourge his bondslave from my hallow court 
with rod of iron and thorn of sharpen steel 
then Absalon revenge not thou this sin 
leave it to i and I will chasten he 

I be content then grant my lord the king 
himself with all his other lord will come 
up to my sheep feast on the plain of Hazor 

nay my fair son myself with all my lord 
will bring thou too much charge yet some shall go 

but let my lord the king himself take pain 
the time of year be pleasant for your grace 
and gladsome summer in her shady robe 
crown with rose and with plant flower 
with all her nymph shall entertain my lord 
that from the thicket of my verdant grove 
will sprinkle honey dew about his breast 
and cast sweet balm upon his kingly head 
then grant thy servant boon and go my lord 

let it content my sweet son Absalon 
that I may stay and take my other lord 

but shall thy best belove Ammon go 

what need it that Ammon go with thou 

yet do thy son and servant so much grace 

Ammon shall go and all my other lord 
because I will give grace to Absalon 

please my lord the king his servant joab 
have send Urias from the syrian war 

Welcome Urias from the syrian war 
welcome to David as his dear lord 

thank be to Israel god and David grace 
Urias find such greeting with the king 

no other greeting shall Urias find 
as long as David sway the elect seat 
and consecrate throne of Israel 
tell i Urias of my servant joab 
fight he with truth the battle of our god 
and for the honour of the lord anoint 

thy servant joab fight the choose war 
with truth with honour and with high success 
and against the wicked king of Ammon son 
have by the finger of our sovereign god 
besiege the city Rabath and achieve 
the court of water where the conduit run 
and all the Ammonite delight some spring 
therefore he wish David mightiness 
shall number out the host of Israel 
and come in person to the city Rabath 
that so her conquest may be make the king 
and joab fight as his inferior 

This have dot God and joab prowess do 
without Urias valour I be sure 
who since his true conversion from a Hittite 
to a adopt son of Israel 
have seek like one who arm be lift by heaven 
and who bright sword be edge with Israel wrath 
go therefore home Urias take thy rest 
visit thy wife and household with the joy 
a victor and a favourite of the king 
shall exercise with honour after arm

nor constitute on such a sickly mould 
that for so little service he shall feign 
and seek as coward refuge of his home 
not be his thought so sensual stir 
to stay the arm with which the lord will smite 
and fill their circle with his conquer foe 
for wanton bosom of a flatter wife 

Urias have a beauteous sober wife 
yet young and frame of tempt flesh and blood 
then when the king have summon thou from arm 
if thou unkind shall refrain her bed 
sin may be lay upon Urias soul 
if Bethsabe by frailty hurt her fame 
then go Urias folly in her love 
who God have knit to thou tremble to lose 

the king be much too tender of my ease 
the ark and Israel and juda dwell 
in palace and rich pavilion 
but joab and his brother in the field 
suffer the wrath of winter and the sun 
and shall Urias of more shame than they 
banquet and loiter in the work of heaven 
as sure as thy soul do live my lord 
my ear shall never lean to such delight 
when holy labour call i forth to fight 

then be it with Urias manly heart 
as best his fame may shine in Israel 

thus shall Urias heart be best content 
till thou dismiss i back to joab hand 
this ground before the king my master door he lie down 
shall be my couch and this unwearied arm

for never will I lodge within my house

like as the fatal raven that in his voice 
carry the dreadful summons of our death 
fly by the fair arabian spicery 
her pleasant garden and delightsome park 
seem to curse they with his hoarse exclaim 
and yet do stoop with hungry violence 
upon a piece of hateful carrion 
so wretched man displease with those delight 
will yield a quicken savour to his soul 
pursue with eager and unstaunched thirst 
the greedy long of his loathsome flesh 
if holy David so shake hand with sin 
what shall our base spirit glory in 
this kingly give lust her reign 
pursue the sequel with a great ill 
Urias in the forefront of the war 
be murder by the hateful heathen sword 
and David joy his too dear Bethsabe 
suppose this past and that the child be bear

and in the gate and entrance of my heart 
sadness with wreathe arm hang her complaint 
no comfort from the ten string instrument 
the twinkle cymbal or the ivory lute 
nor do the sound of David kingly harp 
make glad the break heart of Bethsabe 
jerusalem be fill with thy complaint 
and in the street of Zion fit thy grief 
the babe in sick sick to the death I fear 
the fruit that spring from thou to David house 
nor may the pot of honey and of oil

my sweet Urias fall into the pit 
be thou and go even to the gate of hell 
for Bethsabe that will not shroud her shame 
o what be it to serve the lust of king 
how lionlike thy rage when we resist 
but Bethsabe in humbleness attend 
the grace that God will to his handmaid send Exit Beth 
the babe be sick and sad be David heart 
to see the guiltless bear the guiltless pain 
David hang up thy harp hang down thy head 
and dash thy ivory lute against the stone

in that thou spare Absalon thy child 
a beautiful and fair young man be he 
in all his body be no blemish see 
his hair be like the wire of David harp

and ransack Ammon rich treasury 
live Absalon my son live once in peace

why live Absalon and be not honour 
of tribe and elder and the mighty one 
that round about his temple he may wear 
garland and wreath set on with reverence 
that every one that have a cause to plead 
may come to Absalon and call for right 
then in the gate of Zion will I sit 
and publish law in great jerusalem 
and not a man shall live in all the land 
but Absalon will do he reason due 
therefore I shall address i as I may 
to love the man and tribe of Israel 

proud lust the bloody traitor to our soul 
who greedy throat nor earth air sea or heaven 
can glut or satisfy with any store 
thou be the cause these torment suck my blood 
pierce with venom of thy poison eye 
the strength and marrow of my taint bone 
to punish Pharaoh and his curse host 
the water shrink at great Adonis voice 
and sandy bottom of the sea appear 
offer his service at his servant foot 
and to inflict a plague on David sin 
he make his bowel traitor to his breast 
wind about his heart with mortal gripe 
ah Absalon the wrath of heaven inflame 
thy scorch bosom with ambitious heat 
and Satan set thou on a lusty tower 
show thy thought the pride of Israel 
of choice to cast thou on her ruthless stone 
weep with i then you son of Israel 
lie down with David and with David mourn 
before the holy one that see our heart 
season this heavy soil with shower of tear 
and fill the face of every flower with dew 
weep Israel for David soul dissolve 
lade the fountain of his drown eye 
and power her substance on the senseless earth 

weep Israel oh weep for David soul 
strew the ground with hair and garment tear 
for tragic witness of your hearty woe 

o will our eye be conduit to our heart 
and that our heart be sea of liquid blood 
to pour in stream upon this holy mount 
for witness we will die for David woe 

then shall this mount of olive seem a plain 
drown with a sea that with our sigh shall roar 
and in the murmur of his mount wave 
report our bleed sorrow to the heaven 
for witness we will die for David woe 

earth can weep enough for David woe 
then weep you heaven and all you cloud dissolve 
that piteous star may see our misery 
and drop their golden tear upon the ground 
for witness how they weep for David woe 

now let my sovereign raise his prostrate bone 
and mourn not as a faithless man will do 
but be assure that jacob righteous God 
that promise never to forsake your throne 
will still be just and pure in his vow 

Sadoc high priest preserver of the ark 
who sacred virtue keep the choose crown 
I know my god be spotless in his vow 
and that these hair shall greet my grave in peace 
but that my son shall wrong his tender soul 
and fight against his father happiness 
turn all my hope into despair of he 
and that despair feed all my vein with grief 

think of it David as a fatal plague 
which grief preserve but prevent not 
and turn thy droop eye upon the troop 
that of affection to thy worthiness 
do swarm about the person of the king 
cherish their valour and their zealous love 
with pleasant look and sweet encouragement 

methinks the voice of Ithay fill my ear 

let not the voice of Ithay loath thy ear 
who heart will balm thy bosom with his tear 

but wherefore go thou to the war with we 
thou be a stranger here in Israel 
and son to Achis mighty king of Gath 
therefore return and with thy father stay 
thou come but yesterday and shall I now 
let thou partake these trouble here with we 
keep both thyself and all thy soldier safe 
let i abide the hazard of these arm 
and God requite the friendship thou have show 

as sure as Israel god give David life 
what place or peril shall contain the king 
the same will Ithay share in life and death 

then gentle Ithay be thou still with we 
a joy to David and a grace to Israel 
go Sadoc now and bear the ark of God 
into the great jerusalem again 
if I find favour in his gracious eye 
then will he lie his hand upon my heart 
yet once again before I visit death 
give it strength and virtue to my eye 
to taste the comfort and behold the form 
of his fair ark and holy tabernacle 
but if he say my wont love be wear 
and I have no delight in David now 
here lie I arm with a humble heart 
to embrace the pain that anger shall impose 
and kiss the sword my lord shall kill i with 
than Sadoc take Ahimaas thy son 
with jonathan son to Abiathar 
and in these field will I repose myself 
till they return from you some certain news 

thy servant will with joy obey the king 
and hope to cheer his heart with happy news 

now that it be no grief unto the king 
let i for good inform his majesty 
that with unkind and graceless Absalon 
Achitophel your ancient counsellor 
direct the state of this rebellion 

then do it aim with danger at my crown 
oh thou that hold he rage bloody bind 
within the circle of the silver moon 
that gird earth centre with his watery scarf 
limit the counsel of Achitophel 
no bound extend to my soul distress 
but turn his wisdom into foolishness 

happiness and honour to my lord the king 

what happiness or honour may betide 
his state that toil in my extremity 

o let my gracious sovereign cease these grief 
unless he wish his servant Cusay death 
who life depend upon my lord relief 
then let my presence with my sigh presume 
the pleasant closet of my sovereign soul 

no Cusay no thy presence unto i 
will be a burden since I tender thou 
and can break thy sigh for David sake 
but if thou turn to fair jerusalem 
and say to Absalon as thou have be 
a trusty friend unto his father seat 
so thou will be to he and call he king 
Achitophel counsel may be bring to nought 
then have Sadoc and Abiathar 
all three may learn the secret of my son 
send the message by Ahimaas 
and friendly jonathan who both be there 
then rise refer the success to heaven 

Cusay I rise though with unwieldy bone 
I carry arm against my Absalon exeunt 

now you that be my father concubine 
liquor to his enchase and lustful fire 
have see his honour shake in his house 
which I possess in sight of all the world 
I bring you forth for soil to my renown 
and to eclipse the glory of your king 
who life be with his honour fast enclose 
within the entrails of a jetty cloud 
who dissolution shall pour down in shower 
the substance of his life and swell pride 
then shall the star light earth with rich aspect 
and heaven shall burn in love with Absalon 
who beauty will suffice to chaste all mist 
and clothe the sun sphere with a triple fire 
soon then his clear eye shall suffer stain 
or be offend with a lower day 

thy father honour graceless Absalon 
and we thus beat with thy violent arm 
will cry for vengeance to the host of heaven 
who power be ever arm against the proud 
and will dart plague at thy aspire head 
for do this disgrace to David throne 

to David throne to David holy throne 
who sceptre angel guard with sword of fire 
and sit as eagle on his conquer fist 
ready to prey upon his enemy 
then think not thou the captain of his foe 
be thou much swift than Azahell be 
that can outpace the nimble footed roe 
to escape the fury of their thump beak 
or dreadful scope of their command wing 

let not my lord the king of Israel 
be angry with a silly woman threat 
but with the pleasure he have erst enjoy 
turn they into their cabinet again 
till David conquest be their overthrow 

into your bower you daughter of disdain 
get by fury of unbridle lust 
and wash your couch with your mourn tear 
for grief that David kingdom be decay 

no Absalon his kingdom be enchain 
fast to the finger of great jacob god 
which will not lose it for a rebel love exeunt 

if I may give advice unto the king 
these concubine shall buy their taunt with blood 

Amasa no but let thy martial sword 
empty the pain of David arm man 
and let these foolish woman escape our hand 
to recompense the shame they have sustain 
First Absalon be by the trumpet sound 
proclaim through Hebron king of Israel 
and now be set in fair jerusalem 
with complete state and glory of a crown 
fifty fair footman by my chariot run 
and to the air who rupture ring my fame 
where ere I ride they offer reverence 
why shall not Absalon that in his face 
carry the final purpose of his god 
that be to work he grace in Israel 
endeavour to achieve with all his strength 
the state that most may satisfy his joy 
keep his statute and his covenant pure 
his thunder be entangle in my hair 
and with my beauty be his lightning quench 
I be the man he make to glory in 
when by the error of my father sin 
he lose the path that lead into the land 
wherewith our choose ancestor be bless 

long may the beauteous king of Israel live 
to who the people do by thousand swarm 

what mean Cusay so to greet his foe 
in this the love thou show to David soul 
to who assistance thou have vow thy life 
why leave thou he in this extremity 

because the lord and Israel choose thou 
and as before I serve thy father turn 
with counsel acceptable in his sight 
so likewise will I now obey his son 

then welcome Cusay to king Absalon 
and now my lord and love counsellor 
I think it time to exercise our arm 
against forsake David and his host 
give counsel first my good Achitophel 
what time and order we may best observe 
for prosperous manage of these high exploit 

let i choose out twelve thousand valiant man 
and while the night hide with her sable mist 
the close endeavour cunning soldier use 
I will assault thy discontent fire 
and while with weakness of their weary arm 
surcharge with toil to shun thy sudden power 
the people fly in huge disorder troop 
to save their life and leave the king alone 
then will I smite he with his late wound 
and bring the people to thy foot in peace 

well have Achitophel give his advice 
yet let we hear what Cusay counsel we 
who great experience be well worth the ear 

though wise Achitophel be much more meet 
to purchase hear with my lord the king 
for all his former counsel than myself 
yet not offend Absalon or he 
this time it be not good nor worth pursuit 
for well thou know thy father man be strong 
chafe as she bear rob of their whelp 
beside the king himself a valiant man 
train up in feat and stratagem of war 
and will not for prevention of the worst 
lodge with the common soldier in the field 
but now I know his wont policy 
have teach he lurk within some secret cave 
guard with all his stout soldier 
which if the forefront of his battle faint 
will yet give out that Absalon do fly 
and so thy soldier be discourage 
David himself withal who angry heart 
be as a lion let of his walk 
will fight himself and all his man to one 
before a few shall vanquish he by fear 
my counsel therefore be with trumpet sound 
to gather man from dan to Bersabe 
that they may march in number like sea sand 
that nestle close in another neck 
so shall we come upon he in our strength 
like to the dew that fall in shower from heaven 
and leave he not a man to march withal 
beside if any city succour he 
the number of our man shall fetch we rope 
and we will pull it down the river stream 
that not a stone be leave to keep we out 

what say my lord to Cusay counsel now 

I fancy Cusay counsel better far 
than that be give we from Achitophel 
and so I think do every soldier here 

Cusay counsel be better than Achitophel 

then march we after Cusay counsel all 
sound trumpet through the bound of Israel 
and muster all the man will serve the king 
that Absalon may glut his long soul 
with sole fruition of his father crown exeunt 

ill shall they fare that follow thy attempt 
that scorn the counsel of Achitophel 

thus have the power of jacob jealous god 
fulfil his servant David drift by i 
and bring Achitophel advice to scorn 

God save lord Cusay and direct his zeal 
to purchase David conquest against his son 

what secret have thou glean from Absalon 

these sacred priest that bear the ark of God 
Achitophel advise he in the night 
to let he choose twelve thousand fight man 
and he will come on David at unware 
while he be weary with his violent toil 
but I advise to get a great host 
and gather man from dan to Bersabe 
to come upon he strong in the field 
then send Ahimaas and jonathan 
to signify these secret to the king 
and will he not to stay this night abroad 
but get he over Jordan present 
lest he and all his people kiss the sword 

then go Ahimaas and jonathan 
and straight convey this message to the king 

father we will if Absalon chief spy 
prevent not this devise and stay we here exeunt 

the man of Israel that have rule as king 
or rather as the tyrant of the land 
bolster he hateful head upon the throne 
that God unworthy have bless he with 
shall now I hope lay it as low as hell 
and be depose from his detest chair 
o that my bosom can by nature bear 
a sea of poison to be pour upon 
his curse head that sacred balm have grace 
and consecrate king of Israel 
or will my breath be make the smoke of hell 
infect with the sigh of damn soul 
or with the reek of that serpent gorge 
that feed on adder toad and venomous root 
that as I open my revenge lip 
to curse the shepherd for his tyranny 
my word may cast rank poison to his pore 
and make his swell and rankle sinew crack 
like to the combat blow that break the cloud 
when jove stout champion fight with fire 
see where he come that my soul abhor 
I have prepare my pocket full of stone 
to cast at he mingle with earth and dust 
which burst with disdain I greet he with 

Come forth thou murderer and wicked man 
the lord have bring upon thy curse head 
the guiltless blood of Saul and all his son 
who royal throne thy baseness have usurp 
and to revenge it deep on thy soul 
the lord have give the kingdom to thy son 
and he shall wreak the traitorous wrong of Saul 
even as thy sin have still importune heaven 
so shall thy murder and adultery 
be punish in the sight of Israel 
as thou deserve with blood with death and hell 

why do his dead dog curse my lord the king 
let i alone to take away his head 

why meddle thus the son of Zervia 
to interrupt the action of our god 
Semei use i with this reproach 
because the lord have send he to reprove 
the sin of David print in his brow 
with blood that blush for his conscience guilt 
who dare then ask he why he curse i 

if then thy conscience tell thou thou have sin 
and that thy life be odious to the world 
command thy follower to shun thy face 
and by thyself here make away thy soul 
that I may stand and glory in thy shame 

I be not desperate Semei like thyself 
but trust unto the covenant of my god 
found on mercy with repentance build 
and finish with the glory of my soul 

a murderer and hope for mercy in thy end 
hate and destruction sit upon thy brow 
to watch the issue of thy damn ghost 
which with thy late gasp they will take and tear 
hurl in every pain of hell a piece 
hence murderer thou shame to Israel 
foul lecher drunkard plague to heaven and earth 

what be it piety in David thought 
so to abhor from law of policy 
in this extremity of his distress 
to give his subject cause of carelessness 
send hence the dog with sorrow to his grave 

why shall the son of Zervia seek to check 
his spirit which the lord have thus inspire 
behold my son which issue from my flesh 
with equal fury seek to take my life 
how much more than the son of jemini 
chief since he do nought but god command 
it may be he will look on i this day 
with gracious eye and for his curse bless 
the heart of David in his bitterness 

what do thou fret my soul with sufferance 
oh that the soul of Isboseth and Abner 
which thou send swim to their grave in blood 
with wound fresh bleed gasp for revenge 
be here to execute my burn hate 
but I will hunt thy font with curse still 
hence monster murderer mirror of contempt 

long life to David to his enemy death 

Welcome Ahimaas and jonathan 
what news send Cusay to thy lord the king 

Cusay will wish my lord the king 
to pass the river Jordan present 
lest he and all his people perish here 
for wise Achitophel have counsel Absalon 
to take advantage of your weary arm 
and come this night upon you in the field 
but yet the lord have make his counsel scorn 
and Cusay policy with praise prefer 
which be to number every Israelite 
and so assault you in their pride of strength 

Abiathar beside entreat the king 
to send his man of war against his son 
and hazard not his person in the field 

thank to Abiathar and to you both 
and to my Cusay who the lord requite 
but ten time treble thanks to his soft hand 
who pleasant touch have make my heart to dance 
and play he praise in my zealous breast 
that turn the counsel of Achitophel 
after the prayer of his servant lip 
now will we pass the river all this night 
and in the morning sound the voice of war 
the voice of bloody and unkindly war 

then tell we how thou will divide thy man 
and who shall have the special charge herein 

joab thyself shall for thy charge conduct 
the first three part of all my valiant man 
the second shall Abisay valour lead 
the three fair Ithay which I most shall grace 
for comfort he have do to David woe 
and I myself will follow in the midst 

that let not David for though we shall fly 
ten thousand of we be not half so much 
esteem with David enemy as himself 
thy people love thou deny thou this 

what seem they best then that will David do 
but now my lord and captain hear his voice 
that never yet pierce piteous heaven in vain 
then let it not slip light through your ear 
for my sake spare the young man Absalon 
joab thyself do once use friendly word 
to reconcile my heart incense to he 
if then thy love be to thy kinsman sound 
and thou will prove a perfect Israelite 
friend he with deed and touch no hair of he 
not that fair hair with which the wanton wind 
delight to play and love to make in curl 
wherein the nightingale will build their nest 
and make sweet bower in every golden tress 
to sing their lover every night asleep 
o spoil not joab jove fair ornament 
which he have send to solace David soul 
the best you see my lord be swift to sin 
to sin our foot be wash with milk of roe 
and dry again with coal of lightning 
o lord thou see the proud sin poor slave 
and with his bridle pull he to the grave 
for my sake then spare lovely Absalon 

we will my lord for thy sake favour he 

now have Achitophel order his house 
and take leave of every pleasure there 
hereon depend Achitophel delight 
and in this circle must his life be close 
the wise Achitophel who counsel prove 
ever as sound for fortunate success 
as if man ask the oracle of God 
be now use like the fool of Israel 
then set thy angry soul upon her wing 
and let she fly into the shade of death 
and for my death let heaven for ever weep 
make huge flood upon the land I leave 
to ravish they and all their fair fruit 
let all the sigh I breathe for this disgrace 
hang on my hedge like eternal mist 
as mourn garment for their master death 
open earth and take thy miserable son 
into the bowel of thy curse womb 
once in a surfeit thou do spew he forth 
now for fell hunger suck he in again 
and be his body poison to thy vein 
and now thou hellish instrument of heaven 
once execute the arrest of jove just doom 
and stop his breast that curse Israel Exit 

now for the crown and throne of Israel 
to be confirm with virtue of my sword 
and write with David blood upon the blade 
now jove let forth the golden firmament 
and look on he with all thy fiery eye

and keep your blood in temper by your bone 
let joab ensign shroud your manly head

to guard the life of David from his foe 
error have mask your much too forward mind 
and you have sin against the choose state

how God have free he from his enemy 

another time Ahimaas not now

I will my lord and thank thou for thy grace 

what if thy servant shall go to my lord

run if thou will and peace be with thy step 
now follow that you may salute the king 
with humble heart and reconcile soul

and he our sword shall honour to our death 

what mean my lord the lamp of Israel 
from who bright eye all eye receive their light 
to dim the glory of his sweet aspect 
and paint his countenance with his heart distress 
why shall his thought retain a sad conceit 
when every pleasure kneel before his throne 
and sue for sweet acceptance with his grace 
take but your lute and make the mountain dance 
retrieve the sun sphere and restrain the cloud 
give ear to tree make savage lion tame 
impose still silence to the loud wind 
and fill the fair day with foul storm 
then why shall passion of much mean power 
bear head against the heart of Israel 

fair Bethsabe thou may increase the strength 
of these thy argument draw from my skill 
by urge thy sweet sight to my conceit 
who virtue ever serve for sacred balm 
to cheer my pine past all earthly joy 
but Bethsabe the daughter of the high 
who beauty build the tower of Israel 
she that in chain of pearl and unicorn 
lead at her train the ancient golden world 
the world that Adam hold in paradise 
who breath refine all infectious air 
and make the meadow smile at her repair 
Shee she my dear Bethsabe 
fair peace the goddess of our grace here 
be flee the street of fair jerusalem 
the field of Israel and the heart of David 
lead my comfort in her golden chain 
link to the life and soul of Absalon 

then be the pleasure of my sovereign heart 
so wrap within the bosom of that son 
that Salomon who Israel God affect 
and give the name unto he for his love 
shall be no salve to comfort David soul 

Salomon my love be David lord 
or God have name he lord of Israel 
in he for that and since he be thy son 
must David needs be please at the heart 
and he shall sure sit upon my throne 
but Absalon the beauty of my bone 
faite Absalon the counterfeit of love 
sweet Absalon the image of content 
must claim a portion in his father care 
and be in life and death king David son 

yet as my lord have say let Salomon reign 
who God in name have anoint king 
now be he apt to learn the eternal law 
who knowledge be root in his youth 
will beautify his age with glorious fruit 
while Absalon incense with graceless pride 
usurp and stain the kingdom with his sin 
let Salomon be make thy staff of age 
fair Israel rest and honour of thy race 

tell i my Salomon will thou embrace 
thy father precept grave in thy heart 
and satisfy my zeal to thy renown 
with practice of such sacred principle 
as shall concern the state of Israel 

my royal father if the heavenly zeal 
which for my welfare seed upon your soul 
be not sustain with virtue of my own 
if the sweet accent of your cheerful voice 
shall not each hour beat upon my ear 
as sweet as the breath of heaven to he 
that gasp scorch with the summer sun 
I shall be guilty of unpardoned sin 
fear the plague of heaven and shame of earth 
but since I vow myself to learn the skill 
and holy secret of his mighty hand 
who cunning tune the music of my soul 
it will content i father first to learn 
how the eternal frame the firmament 
which body lead their influence by fire 
and which be fill with hoary winter ice 
what sign be rainy and what star be fair 
why by the rule of true proportion 
the year be still divide into month 
the month to day the day to certain hour 
what fruitful race shall fill the future world 
or for what time shall this round build stand 
what magistrate what king shall keep in awe 
man mind with bridle of the eternal law 

Wade not too far my boy in wave too deep 
the feeble eye of our aspire thought 
behold thing present and record thing past 
but thing to come exceed our humane reach 
and be not paint yet in angel eye 
for those submit thy sense and say thou power 
that now art frame of the future world 
know all to come not by the course of heaven 
by frail conjecture of inferior sign 
by monstrous flood by flight and flock of bird 
by bowel of a sacrifice beast 
or by the figure of some hide art 
but by a true and natural presage 
lay the ground and perfect architect 
of all our action now before thy eye 
from Adam to the end of Adam seed 
oh heaven protect my weakness with thy strength 
so look on i that I may view thy face 
and see these secret write in thy brow 
o sun come dart thy ray upon my moon 
that now my eye eclipse to the earth 
may bright be refine and shine to heaven 
transform i from this flesh that I may live 
before my death regenerate with thou 
o thou great God ravish my earthly spirit 
that for the time a more than humane skill 
may feed the organon of all my sense 
that when I think thy thought may be my guide 
and when I speak I may be make by choice 
the perfect echo of thy heavenly voice 
thus say my son and thou shall learn they all 

a secret fury ravish my soul 
lift my mind above her humane bound 
and as the eagle rouse from her stand 
with violent hunger cower in the air 
seize her feather prey and think to feed 
but see then a cloud beneath her foot 
let fall the foul and be embolden 
with eye intentive to bedare the sun 
and sty close unto his stately sphere 
so Salomon mount on the burn wing 
of zeal divine let fall his mortal food 
and cheer his sense with celestial air 
tread in the golden starry labyrinth 
and hold his eye fix on Jehovah brow 
good father teach i further what to do 

see David how his haughty spirit mount 
even now of height to wield a diadem 
then make he promise that he may succeed 
and rest old Israel bone from broil of war 

Nathan thou prophet spring from Jesse root 
I promise thou and lovely Bethsabe 
my Salomon shall govern after i 

he that have touch thou with this righteous thought 
preserve the harbour of thy thought in peace 

my lord thy servant of thy watch have see 
one run hitherward from forth the war 

if he be come alone he bring news 

another have thy servant see my lord 
who run much resemble Sadoc son 

he be a good man and good tiding bring 

peace and content be with my lord the king 
who Israel God have bless with victory 

tell i Ahimaas live my Absalon 

I see a troop of soldier gather 
but know not what the tumult may import 

stand by until some other may inform 
the heart of David with a happy truth 

happiness and honour live with David soul 
who God have bless with conquest of his foe 

but Cusay live the young man Absalon 

the stubborn enemy to David peace 
and all that cast their dart against his crown 
fare ever like the young man Absalon 
for as he ride the wood of Ephraim 
which fight for thou as much as all thy man 
his hair be tangle in a shady oak 
and hang there by joab and his man 
sustain the stroke of well deserve death 

have Absalon sustain the stroke of death 
die David for the death of Absalon 
and make these curse news the bloody dart 
that through his bowel rip thy wretched breast 
hence David walk the solitary wood 
and in some cedar shade the thunder slay 
and fire from heaven have make his branch black 
sit mourning the decease of Absalon 
against the body of that blast plant 
in thousand shiver break thy ivory lute 
hang thy stringless harp upon his bough 
and through the hollow sapless sound trunk 
bellow the torment that perplex thy soul 
there let the wind sit sigh till they burst 
let tempest muffle with a cloud of pitch 
threaten the forest with her hellish face 
and mount fierce on her iron wing 
rend up the wretched engine by the root 
that hold my dear Absalon to death 
then let they toss my break lute to heaven 
even to his hand that beat i with the string 
to show how sad his poor shepherd sing 

die Bethsabe to see thy David mourn 
to hear his tune of anguish and of hell 
oh help my David help thy Bethsabe 
who heart be pierce with thy breathy sword 
and burst with burden of ten thousand grief 
now sit thy sorrow suck of my blood 
oh that it may be poison to their power 
and that their lip may draw my bosom dry 
so David love may ease he though she die 

these violent passion come not from above 
David and Bethsabe offend the high 
to mourn in this immeasurable sort 

o Absalon Absalon oh my son my son 
will God that I have die for Absalon 
but he be dead ah dead Absalon be dead 
and David live to die for Absalon 

why lie the queen so prostrate on the ground 
why be this company so tragic hew 
why be the king now absent from his man 
And march not in triumph through the gate 
David awake if sleep have shut thy eye 
sleep of affection that thou can not see 
the honour offer to the victor head 
joab bring conquest pierce on his spear 
and joy from all the tribe of Israel 

thou man of blood thou sepulchre of death 
who marble breast entomb my bowel quick 
do I not charge thou nay entreat thy hand 
even for my sake to spare my Absalon 
and have thou now in spite of David health 
and scorn to do my heart some happiness 
give he the sword and spill his purple soul 

what irk it David that he victor breath 
that juda and the field of Israel 
shall cleanse their face from their child blood 
what be thou weary of thy royal rule 
be Israel throne a serpent in thy eye 
and he that set thou there so far from thanks 
that thou must curse his servant for his sake 
have thou not say that as the morning light 
the cloudless morning so shall be thy house 
and not as flower by the bright rain 
which grow up quick and as quick fade 
have thou not say the wicked be as thorn 
that can be preserve with the hand 
and that the man shall touch they must be arm 
with coat of iron and garment make of steel 
or with the shaft of a defence spear 
and be thou angry he be now cut off 
that lead the guiltless swarm to their death 
and be more wicked than a host of man 
advance thou from thy melancholy den 
and deck thy body with thy blissful robe 
or by the lord that sway the heaven I swear 
I will lead thy army to another king 
shall cheer they for their princely chivalry 
and not sit daunt frown in the dark 
when his fair look with oil and wine refresh 
shall dart into their bosom gladsome beam 
and fill their stomach with triumphant feast 
that when elsewhere stern war shall sound his trump 
and call another battle to the field 
fame still may bring thy valiant soldier home 
and for their service happy confess 
she want worthy trump to sound their prowess 
take thou this course and live refuse and die 

Come brother let he sit there till he sink 
some other shall advance the name of joab 

o stay my lord stay David mourn no more 
but rise to give honour to your act stay 

then happy be thou David fair son 
that free from the yoke of earthly toil 
and sequester from sense of humane sin 
thy soul shall joy the sacred cabinet 
of those divine idea that present 
thy change spirit with a heaven of bliss 
then thou be go ah thou be go my son 
to heaven I hope my Absalon be go

or angel clad with immortality 
shall reap a sevenfold grace for all thy grief

shall deck the flame heaven with novel lamp 
there shall thou taste the drink of seraphin 
and cheer thy feeling with archangel food 
thy day of rest thy holy sabbath day 
shall be eternal and the curtain draw 
thou shall behold thy sovereign face to face 
with wonder knit in triple unity 
unity infinite and innumerable 
courage brave captain joab tale have stir 
and make the suit of Israel prefer 

brave resolve and speak like a king 
now may old Israel and his daughter sing exeunt
