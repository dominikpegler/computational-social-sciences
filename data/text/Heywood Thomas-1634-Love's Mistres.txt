do not persuade i to disclose my shape 
attempt that thou lose this high state 
I then must leave thou thou live desolate 

in all these thing I will obey my love 

then Psyche in thy unseen husband hand 
clasp thy white finger I will now 〈◊〉 thy bed 
with the sweet spoil of thy lose maidenhead exeunt 
I like he best 

that Midas be thy brother 
a piece of move earth illiterate dull 
who have in himself nought commendable 
envy what be good in other and yet dare 
in his own impudence with art compare 
a block a stone yet learn he will revile 
and a dull ignorant ass we will he style 

but where be your poet ass among all these 

there be no such creature 

then what call thou those 
that let not man lie quiet in their grave 
but haunt their ghost with ballad and bald rhyme 
do they not teach the very fiend in hill 
speak in blank verse do we not daily see 
every dullwitted ass spit poetry 
and for thy scene thou bring here on the stage 
a young greensickness baggage to run after 
a little apefaced boy thou term a god 
be not this most absurd 

misunderstand fool thus much conceive 
Psyche be anima Psyche be the soul 
the soul a virgin long to be a bride 
the soul be immortal who then can she woo 
but heaven who wed but immortality 
o blame not Psyche then if mad with rage 
she long for this so divine marriage 

but tell i then why shall Apollo say 
all love she and yet none will marry she 

all love fair Psyche all cast amorous eye 
on the soul beauty but who be it will wed she 
none with the foul will lead so strict a life 
as heaven enjoin with such a bless wife 

thou prompt my understanding pretty well 
but why shall Venus be queen of love 
wish she son Cupid to enamour she 
on some base groom misshapen and deform 

by Venus here be mean untemperate lust 
lust woe her son desire to inflame the soul 
with some base groom that be to some ugly sin 
desire be good and ill the evil swear 
to obey his mother Venus and vex Psyche 
but Cupid represent true desire 
dote on the soul sweet beauty send his servant 
Zephyrus in who celestial pleasure be mean 
to entice his love the soul to his chaste bed 
give her heaven for her lose maidenhead 

only one riddle more and I have do 
why do the poor girl Psyche take such pain 
what scramble shift she make to climb the mountain 
and crawl through brake and brier to get a husband 

This show how many strong adversity 
cross prick thorn and sting of conscience 
will throw the ambitious soul affect heaven 
into despair and faint diffidence 
which Psyche must pass through the soul must 〈◊〉 
through thousand let to 〈◊〉 eternity 

thou have make this somewhat plain 

kind gentleman 
long flaxen curl tress crown his head 
Come come you shall not be enamour

thy certain pain do I not give thou charge 
to taste the pleasure of immortal love 
but not to wade too deep in mystery

for which I call thou Psyche that be the soul 
for as my soul I love thou now I abjure

my hand shall never lay blessing on thy head 
nor my tongue grace thou with a daughter name

o whither shall a wretch convert her eye 
when her own father shall her tear despise 

attend arcadian 
the proclamation of the paphian queen 

when Hermes speak we be bind to all attendance 

o yes if any can bring Psyche unto Venus 

Psyche who you be send to seek stand there 

then here end Mercury commission 
Psyche in Venus name I do arrest thou 
for wrong to she and Cupid 

I obey 
your high arrest and with a humble suit 
prostrate myself to Catheria wrath 
where be angry Venus 

frantic in this grove 
mourn Adonis death and here she come 

accurse bow why do thou not defend he 
he shall not die Adonis still shall live 
Apollo gentle Phoebus mount thy chariot 
and in his cold breast breathe celestial fire 
for all earth simples can cure his wound 
or if he must expire command the muse 
to give my love immortal memory 
have thou find Psyche o that in this rage 
I can but now forget she 

see where she stand 
with downcast eye and weak upheave hand 

just of my height my state and proportion 
and be her pristine beauty lend she back 
may in the rabble judgement rival i 
strumpet profaner of our sacred right 
how have thou wrong i and abuse my son 
by aim at my honour and his life 

dread paphian queen for lovely Cupid sake 
and this rich burden in my wretched womb 
pity poor Psyche 

have thou play the strumpet 
and for thy sin sake must I pardon thou 
no that alone have make i merciless 

help i dear father sister Mercury 

I dare not speak for thou 

nor I 

nor I 

poor Psyche bear unto adversity

by who you be make a grandam 

I prove ● grandam to a strumpet brat 
go Mercury and from some garner 〈◊〉 
five measure of five several sort of grain 
dispatch it Hermes 

what will Venus do 

thou shall know better when thou back return 
you be young Venus and the queen of love 
that have the ambition to be Cupid wife 
and marry with a god ho Boreus 
since Mercury be slack in his return 
wind her entice lock about thy arm 
and toss her loose carcase in the air 
fling it into the bosom of some storm 
and grind her bone to powder in the fall 

pity i Venus father plead for i 

it be well do Hermes have thou bring the grain 

madam I have 

then minion here be your task 
look on all these see thus I mingle they 

and what must miserable Psyche do 

to several heave with thy own hand divide 
each several seed ere the sun kiss the west 
or look for death go and when that be do 
I will ride to Paphos and enlarge my son 
who yet I keep close prisoner in my closet 

Psyche adieu none can reverse thy doom 

not I 

nor we 

I wish the earth my tomb 

take patience Psyche and be comfort 

comfort alas what comfort can she find 
who father and dear friend prove so unkind 

for Cupid sake who for thy love now 〈◊〉 
a pair of golden shackle on his heel 
this Mercury will do fly hence to Paphos 
and fetch he from his late imprisonment 
then tell he of his mother tyranny 
that do we two will teach thou without pain 
in several heap how to divide this grain 

and where have I be think thou Apuleius 
do thou not miss i 

yes I do not sleep as thou do in thy judgement 

then I perceive 
thou know how I maintain our rural music 
prefer it before Apollo harp 

yes and by that infer thou be all earthy 
nothing celestial in thou 

all be one for that now for your moral 

will thou stay it out 

no it be too dull 
unless thou will quicken i with some conceit 
thy Psyche sadness have make i so heavy 
that Morpheus steal upon i 

what will thou see 

thy little Cupid I like pretty well 
and will see something else what he can do 
more than belong to Psyche 

well to keep the awake 
I will show thou now love contrariety 
which be more than my promise 

I marry this be somewhat like indeed 
here be young and old here be fat and lean the beggar and the king 
love have power over all 
but to your moral now why come your Psyche 
with a sharp razor and a burn lamp 
to murder Cupid than he wake and chafe 
and fling house on it at window be it not so 

I will tell thou she charm by her sister tongue 
think her fair love a serpent and grow mad 
will murder Cupid tear even jove from heaven 
yet note the greatness of celestial mercy 
one glimpse one lamp one spark one divine thought 
pluck back her ar●e and more inflame her breast 
with amorous rapture but because poor soul 
she aim to search forbid mystery 
her eye be blast Cupid loathe her sight 
he leave her ugly and his bless bower 
be rend in piece for heaven seem to fall 
when our poor soul turn diabolical 

for that betwixt pan and Phoebus I know best 
for I be there a umpire but resolve i 
why leave he Psyche when she lose his love 
yet mourn when she be leave of all her friend 

all bid the wretched soul run to despair 
when leprous sin deform she but even then 
when the god hate she when she be scorn of man 
Cupid hang in the air his divine eye 
shed tear for she comfort her misery 

yet he forsake she too 

till Psyche be make fair and angelwhite 
she be not to stand in Cupid glorious fight 

well I be answer 

and for thy part Midas 
laugh sleep or flout nay snarl and cavil too 
which none of these here meet I hope will do

then put she in before on Venus go 

Psyche approach but do not come too near 
that pride thou have already buy too dear 

o pity Psyche she be send to hell

my love not do though thou be quite undo 
unless I arm thou against the dart of death 
which hell aim at thou 

let thy sacred breath 

wound i no more with word for they but grieve i 
now mark what on thy journey must relieve thou 
first high thou to the bank of Acheron 
thou canst not miss the way it be broad and wear 
with trample of ten thousand passenger 
there shall thou find hell churlish ferryman 
his name be Charon there be to pay his hire 
take heed thou lose it not for do so 
he will beat and leave thou on the shore of woe 
be ferry over thou shall spy hell gate 
thou need not knock they be open night and day 
give Cerberus a sop and pass away 

and what be that Cerberus 

porter of hell 
who must at thy return be bribe again 
my great desire to help thou hinder thou 
I shall have tell thou when in Charon barge 
thou be waft over the dreadful wave of Styx 
a age man with a pale countenance 
his name oblivion swim in the flood 
will heave his wither arm and cry help help 
save i from drown stretch not forth thy hand 
for if thou do thou never return to shore 
thou will forget my love see i no more 

I will stop my ear against oblivion cry 

be land thou shall see old wrinkle hag 
spin black thread while folly reel they up 
he will let fall his reel and pray they reach it 
but stoop not they will likewise beckon thou 
to sit down by they but to spin a thread 
take heed do so from i thou be banish 

I will shun their baltes 

be enter Pluto court 
they all will entice thou with a thousand train 
shun all and neither sit nor eat with they 
only deliver what thou be enjoin 
receive the box of beauty and be go 
which still keep shut let not thy dare eye 
behold the wealth that in the box do lie 

dread Cupid 

now farewell have thou but obey i 
thy face have still be lovely and my eye 
dote on thou with heavenly jealousy 

and what do thou think of Cupid now 

do not think I be so stupid 
but to think well of great god Cupid 

and what of poet 

as poet as of potentate for since I play the last prize against Phoebus in which I may say of myself veni vidi vici I have be so trouble with a poetical itch that I can scratch you out rhyme and ballad song and sonnet ode and madrigal till they bleed again 

then thou be reconcile to Homer 

Homer be honourable Hesiod heroical Virgil a vicegerent Naso notorious martial a provost Juvenal a jovial lad and Persius a Paramount what doc I think of poetry of which myself be a profess member 

and may be very well spare and yet the body never the worse but thou may see what become of rail against Cupid what a sweet mistress he have put upon thou 

who my Amarillis 

yes the very dowdy in all Arcadia even Mopsa compare with she show like a madam first she be old 

it be very well say to say first because she be before we and for be old be not age reverend and therefore in my eye she be honourable 

And wrinkle 

be it not the fashion do not our gentile wear their hair crisp the nymph their gown pleat and the fawn their stocking for the more grace wrinkle do not the earth show well when it be plough and the land best when it lie in furrow 

beside she have a horrible long nose 

that be to defend her lip but thou sinner to sense and renegade to reason do thou blame length in any thing do thou not wish thy life long and know thou not that truth come out at length when all our joy be go and pass do not long look for come at last if any of our nymph be wrong will she not say it be long of i it be long of thou or long of he if they buy any commodity by the yard do they not wish it long your advocate wish to have a law suit hang long and the poor client be his cloak never so short and threadbare yet will be glad to wear it long 
no marry man but do his wife much wrong 
though he himself be short to have nothing long 

the short and the long of it be she be a ugly creature make of she what thou canst 

make of she what I can o that all or any of you can like i look upon she with the eye of poetry I will then let you know what I have make of she 

prithee let we hear it 

then listen hither o you imp of ignorance 
o tell i have you ever see 
since you be bear unto this day 
which be long since a wit so green 
and cover with a head so grey 
to praise she still my muse will be 
although therein I have no cunning 
yet be the nose of Amarillis 
like to a cock long and still run 
her eye though dim to seem clear 
and they of rheum can well dispose 
the one do blink the other blear 
in pearldrop strive with her nose 
her breast be like two bed of bliss 
or rather like two leancow udder 
which show that she no change ling be 
because they say such be her mother 
those few tooth leave she in her head 
now stand like hedgestake in her gum 
full of white dandruff be her head 
she put the cobbler down for thumb 
her side be long her belly lank 
and of her leg what shall I say 
but that she feel well in the stanke 
and both her foot themselves display 

all the Homer in Asia can never have come so near the business 

from head to foot for her stature and year pattern she in all Arcadia say she be a foul beast in your eye yet she be my hyren and show foul to other and fair to i I shall live the happy and she the honest but I have a remedy against all this in spite of Cupid 

what be that 

I hear Psyche his mistress be send to hell for a box of beauty it be but waylay of she and take it from she than Amarillis shall compare with any other she that dare 

this last I like and have it all be such 
only a mere discourse betwixt swain and clown 
it then have please i now some quaint device 
some kickshaw or other to keep i wake 

then by the leave of these spectator here 
I will suit i to thy low capacity 
let he know this day Latona son 
enter the first house of his zodiac
