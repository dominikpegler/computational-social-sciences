


PAST two o'clock and not yet returned! Well, well! It's my own fault! Mr. Smith!








Is Mr. Sulky come in?







Are you sure Harry Dornton said he should return to-night?







And you don't know where he is gone?



He did not tell me, sir.



 I ask you if you know!



I believe to Newmarket, sir.



You always believe the worst! I'll sit up no longer Tell the servants to go to bed And do you hear, should he apply to you for money, don't let him have a guinea.







I have done with him; he is henceforth no son of mine! Let him starve!



He acts very improperly, sir, indeed.



Improperly! How? What does he do?







Have you heard any thing of ?



 No No, sir Nothing Nothing but what you yourself tell me.



Then how do you known he has acted improperly▪



He is certainly a very good-hearted young gentleman, sir.



Good-hearted! How dare you make such an assertion?







How dare you, Mr. Smith, insult me so? Is not his gaming notorious; his racing, driving, riding, and associating with knaves, fools, debauchees, and black legs?



Upon my word, sir I 







I shall be careful to observe your orders, sir.



Sir!  Why, would you see him starve? Would you see him starve and not lend him a guinea? Would you sir? Would you?



Sir! Certainly not▪ except in obedience to your orders!



 And could any orders justify your seeing a poor unfortunate youth, rejected by his father, abandoned by his friends, starving to death?



There is no danger of that, sir,



I tell you the thing shall happen! He shall starve to death!  I'll never look on him more as a son of mine; and I am very certain, when I have forsaken him, all the world will forsake him too.  Yes, yes! He is born to be a poor wretched outcast!



I hope, sir, he still will make a fine man.



Will! There is not a finer, handsomer, nobler looking youth in the kingdom; no not in the world!



I mean a worthy good man, sir.



How can you mean any such thing! The company he keeps would corrupt a saint.



Sir▪ if you will only tell me what your pleasure is, I will endeavour to act like a faithful servant.



I know you are a faithful servant, Mr. Smith.   I know you are But you You are not a father.






Well, Mr. Sulky, have you heard any thing of him?







And, hay ? Any thing consoling, any thing good?







No? No, say you! Where is he? What is he about?







Don't ? You love to torture me, sir! You love to torture me.







For heaven's sake tell me what you have heard!



I love to torture you.



















Mercy defend me! Where? What?



The first paragraph in the postscript: the beginning line in capitals.



The junior partner of the great banking house, not a mile from the Post-office, has again been touched at Newmarket, for upward of ten thousand pounds   It can't be!















How do you know? What proof have you that this is not a lie?











Bills at three days sight to the full amount have already been presented.











But! Why! Were you mad, Mr. Sulky? Were you mad?



I soon shall be.



Is not his name struck off the firm?



They were dated two days before.



The credit of my house begins to totter!







What the effect of such a paragraph may be I cannot tell!







Are you serious, sir?



I am not inclined to laugh A run against the house, stoppage, disgrace, bankruptcy.



Really, Mr Sulky, you 



Yes, I know I offend. I was bred in your house, you used me tenderly, I served you faithfully, and you admitted me a partner. Don't think I care for myself. No, I can sit at the desk again. But You! You! First man of the first commercial city on earth, your name in the Gazette? Were it mine only I would laugh at it. What am I? Who cares for me?



"Where is the vile ?"



Who can tell? With his lords and his ladies, his court friends and his Newmarket friends, his women of wit and his men of soul, his blue stockings and his black legs!



 Mr Smith! Thomas! William!


Call all the servants together, Mr Smith; clerks, footmen, maids, every soul! Tell them their young master is a scoundrel!







Sir?   Bid them shut the door in his face! I'll turn the first away that lets him set foot in this house ever again!







Very well, sir? Damn your very well, sir! I tell you it is not very well, sir. He shall starve, die, rot in the street! Is that very well, sir?










Don't stir! On your lives, don't go to the door! Are the bolts and locks all fastened?










Harry DORNTON, MILFORD, and Postillions.
Postillion We smoked along, your honour!


 I know you did. Had you been less free with your whip you would have been half a crown richer. Your next step should be to turn drummers, and handle the cat o' nine tails.



It is very late you honour!







 Knock again, you scoundrel, and you shall have the full contents loaded to the muzzle, rascal!



So! I suspected dad was in his tantarums.



You have given him some cause:



Very true  Consider, my dear sir, the consequences of lying out all night;







Bad women, sir; damps, night air!



Will you be gone?







Come, come, sir  



We shall not get in:



Pshaw! How little do you know of my father, the door will open in less than fifteen seconds;



Done, for a hundred:







No, It won't do,





My old master is in a bitter passion, sir,







He is gone down to turn the servant out of doors that let you in:



Is he? Then go you and let your fellow-servant in again:



I dare not sir,







He enquired who was with my young master,














All's well that ends well. This has been a cursed losing voyage, Milford:



I am a hundred and fifty▪ in,



And I ten thousand out!



I believe I had better avoid▪ your father for the present,



I think you had. Dad considers you as my tempter, the cause of my ruin,



And I being in his debt, he conceives he may treat me without ceremony.



Nay, damn it, Jack, do him justice; it is not the money you had of him, but the ill advice he imputes to you that galls him:



I hear he threatens to arrest me;



Yes, he has threatened to strike my name out of the firm, and disinherit me, a thousand times:



Oh, but he has been very serious in menacing me,







You'll be at the tennis-court to morrow?







What, not to see the grand match?







Oh yes, you will.



No, I am determined:



Yes, over night, you'll waver in the morning;



No, It is high time, Jack, to grow prudent:



Ha, ha, ha, my plan is formed: I'll soon be out of debt,



How will you get the money?







Ha, ha, ha 



I am resolved on it. What! can't a man of invention and genius out-wit a black-leg?



"Yes, if he will be as great a scoundrel."



That's not necessary. A keen eye a contriving head, a lucky moment and a little algebra will rout the whole host. How many men of rank and honour, having lost their fortunes, have double recovered them











Ha, ha, ha Nobody, Nobody;



But pray Harry, what is it you find so attractive in my late father's amorous relict?



Ha, ha, ha! What the widow Warren?



She seems to think and even reports you are to marry 



Marry? Her? A coquette of forty, who ridiculously apes all the airs of a girl! Fantastic, selfish and a fool! And marry? Disgusting idea! Thou wert philosophising as we drove on the condition of a post-horse 







I would rather be a post-horse, nay the rascal that drives a post-horse, than the base thing thou hast imagined!



Then why are you so often there?



Because I can't keep away:



What, it is her daughter, Sophia?







The poor young thing is fond of you?



I should be half mad if I though she was not, yet am obliged to half hope she is not!







What a question! Am I not a profligate, and in all probability ruined? Not even my father can overlook this last affair No, Heigho;



The loss of my father's will, and the mystery made of its contents by those who witnessed it, are strange circumstances!



In which the widow triumphs. And you being a bastard, and left by law to starve, she willingly pays obedience to laws so wise.



She refuses even to pay my debts.



And the worthy alderman, your father, being overtaken by death in the south of France, carefully makes a will, and then as carefully hides it where it is not to be found; or commits it to the custody of some mercenary knave, who has made his market of it to the widow So! here comes the supposed executor of this supposed will.


My dear Mr. Sulky, how do you do?






Indeed? I am very sorry! What's your disorder?



















To a new tune.



Ha, ha, ha 







What, my good cynic?















No I have a father,



Who is ruined likewise:



Ha, ha, ha! Is the Bank of England ruined?



I say ruined. Nothing less than a miracle can save the house. The purse of Fortunatus could not supply you,



No; it held nothing but guineas, notes, bills paper for me!



Such effrontery is insufferable. For these five years, sir, you have been driving to ruin more furiously than 



An ambassadour's coach on a birth night. I saw you were stammering for a simile.







Youth mounts the box, seizes the reins, and jehus headlong on in the dark; Passion and Prodigality blaze in the front, bewilder the coachman, and dazzle and blind the passengers; Wisdom, Prudence, and Virtue are overset and maimed or murdered; and at last Repentance, like the footman's flambeau lagging behind, lights us to dangers when they are past all remedy.



Your name is struck off the firm. I was the adviser



You are very kind, Mr Sulky,



Your father is at last determined.



Ha, ha, ha Do you think so?



You'll find so! And what brought you here, sir?







It might have carried you to a safer place. When do you mean to pay your debts?



When my father's executor prevails on the widow Warren to do me justice.



And which way am I to prevail?



And which way am I to pay my debts?



You might have more modesty than insolently to come and brave one of your principal creditors, after having ruined his son by your evil counsel.



Ha, ha, ha, Don't believe a word on't, my good grumbler; I ruined myself, I wanted no counsellor,



My father died immensely rich; and, though I am what the law calls illegitimate, I ought not to starve



You have had five thousand pounds, and are five more in debt.



Yes, thanks to those who trust boys with thousands,



You would do the same now you think yourself a man,



 Indeed I would not.



Had you been watching the widow at home, instead of galloping after a knot of gamblers and pickpockets, you might perhaps have done yourself more service:







The will of your late father is found.







I have received a letter, from which I learn it was at last discovered, carefully locked up in a private drawer, and that it is now a full month since a gentleman of Montpelier, coming to England, was entrusted with it. But no such gentleman has yet appeared.



If it should have got into the hands of the widow 



Which I suspect it has, You are a couple of pretty gentlemen! But beware: misfortune is at your heels, Mr. Dornton vows vengeance on you both, and justly. He is not gone to bed▪ and if you have confidence enough to look him in the face, I would have you stay where you are,







Do you know, sir, your father turned the poor fellow into the street, who compassionately opened the door for you?



Yes; and my father knows I as compassionately opened the door for the poor fellow in return▪



Very well, sir Your fame is increasing daily:



I am glad to hear it:



Humph! Then perhaps you have paragraphed yourself?







In the St. James's Evening:







Stating the exact amount:







Yours You march through every avenue to fame, dirty▪ or clean,



Well said! Be witty when you can; sarcastic you must be, in spite of your teeth. But I like you the better. You are honest, you are my cruet of Cayenne, and a sprinkling of you is excellent:



Well, sir, when you know the state of your own affairs, and to what you have reduced the house, you will perhaps be less ready to grin.



Reduced the house! ha, ha, ha!








 I am happy to see you, sir.



You are there, after having broken into my house at midnight! And you are here,  after having ruined me and my house by your unprincipled prodigality! Are you not a scoundrel?



No, sir: I am only a fool.



Good night to you gentlemen.



Stay▪ where you are, Mr Sulky, I beg you to stay where you are, and be a witness to my solemn renunciation of him and his vices!



I have witnessed it a thousand times:



But this is the last, Are you not a scoundrel, I say?



I am your son,



 Mr Smith! Bring in those deeds.


You will not deny you are an incorrigible squanderer?


I will deny nothing,



A nuisance, a wart, a blot, a stain upon the face of nature!



A stain that will wash out sir,



A redundancy, a negation; a besotted sophisticated incumbrance; a jumble of fatuity; your head, your heart, your words, your actions. all a jargon; incoherent and unintellegible to yourself, absurd and offensive to others!



The whirlwind is rising.



I am whatever you please, sir.



Bills never examined, every thing bought on credit, the price of nothing asked, conscious you were weak enough to wish for baubles you did not want, and pant for pleasures you could not enjoy, you had not the effrontery to assume the circumspect caution of common sense! And to your other destructive follies, you must add the detestable vice of gaming!



These things, sir, are much easier done than defended,



But here Give me that parchment!  The partners have all been summoned▪ Look, sir! Your name has been formally erased!



The partners are very kind.



The suspicions already incurred by the known profligacy of a principal in the firm, the immensc sums you have drawn, this paragraph, the run on the house it will occasion, the consternation of the whole city 



All very terrible, and some of it very true.




 Give me the will, Mr Smith! Give me the will! Fond and foolish as I have been, read, and you will find I am at last restored to my senses! If I should happily outlive the storm you have raised, it shall not be to support a prodigal, or to reward a gambler! You are dis••herited! Read!



Your word is as good as the Bank, sir.



I'll no longer act the doting father, fascinated by your arts!



I never had any art, sir, except the one you taught me.



I taught you! What? Scoundrel! What?



That of loving you, sir,











 Why, can you say, Harry Rascal! I mean, that you love me?



I should be a rascal indeed if I did not sir,



Harry! Harry!  No! Confound me if I do! sir, you are a vile !



I know I am.







Bid me good night, sir, Mr Sulky here will bid me good night, and you are my father! Good night, Mr Sulky,











 I won't! If I do 



Reproach me with my follies, strike out my name, disinherit me, I deserve it all and more But say Good night, Harry!



I won't! I won't! I won't! 



Poverty is a trifle; we can whistle it off But enmity 







Sleep in enmity? And who can say how soundly? Come! Good night.







Say you so? Why then, my noble hearted dad, I am indeed a scoundrel!








Good night! And Heaven eternally bless you, sir! Heigho! That's something. 


Time, would let him wisely pass,
Is lively brisk and jolly,
All is not quite as it should be; but  

Dip but his wings in the sparkling glass,
And he'll drown dull melancholy,










JENNY and Mrs LEDGER,


I TELL you, good woman, I can do nothing for you.



Only let me see Mrs Warren,



And get myself snubbed. Not I indeed.




La, Jenny! Yonder's my mamma, with a whole congregation of milliners, mantua-makers, mercers, haberdashers, lacemen, feathermen, and and all the world, consulting about second mourning!







It will be six months to morrow since the death of my father-in-law; and she has been busy giving orders for this fortnight that every thing might be brought home and tried on to-day. I do believe she'll sleep in her new clothes!



How you run on, miss!



What would my dear grandma' say, if she saw her? Why she is even fonder of finery than I am!



Sure, miss, you are not fond of finery?



Oh but I am I wonder why she won't let me wear high-heeled shoes! I am sure I am old enough! I shall be eighteen next Christmas day at midnight, which is only nine months and two days! And since she likes to wear slips, and sashes, and ringlets and nonsense, like a girl, why should not I have high heels, and gowns and festinis, and hoops, and trains, and sweeps  and like a woman?



It's very true what your mamma tells you, miss; you have been spoiled by your old fond grandmother in Gloucestershire.



Nay, Jenny, I won't hear you call my dear grandma' names! Though every body told the loving old soul she would spoil me.



And now your mamma has sent for you up to town to finish your edication.



Yes, she began it the very first day: There was the stay-maker sent for, to screw up my shapes; the shoe-maker, to cripple my feet; the hair dresser, to burn my hair; the jeweller, to bore my ears; and the dentist, to file my teeth.



Ah! You came here such a hoyden!  What, an't you gone yet, mistress?



La, Jenny, how can you be so cross to people? What is the matter with this good woman?



Oh! Nothing but poverty.



Is that all? Here  give her this half crown, and make her rich.







What, is not it enough? La, I am sorry I spent all my money yesterday! I laid it out in sweetmeats, cakes, a Canary bird, and a poll parret. But I hope you are not very, very poor?



My husband served the late alderman five-and-twenty years. His master promised to provide for him; but his pitiless widow can see him thrown with a broken heart upon the parish,



Oh dear! stop! stop a bit!  Be sure you don't go!




Where's your mistress girl?



My name is Jane Cocket, sir,











Tell her to come down Don't stare, girl, but go and tell your mistress I want her.





Re-enter SOPHIA, with great glee.


I've got it! here! take this, good woman; go home and be happy! Take it, I tell you!




who is this? Mrs Ledger! how does your worthy husband?



Alack, sir, ill enough, likely to starve in his latter days,







The widow refuses to do any thing for him,







Service, age, and honesty are poor pleas, with affluence, ease, and Mrs Warren,







You, sir, I understand are the late alderman's executor?







Perhaps you may be able to serve my husband?



I don't know however, give my respects to him: he shan't starve: tell him that.



Nay, but take this in the mean time,



Ay; take it, take it,  And who are you, miss Charity?



Me, sir? Oh I I am my grandma's granddaughter.











Oh! The widow's daughter by her first husband?












Coming, sir so you have stolen your mamma's purse, miss?



La, don't say so; I only ran away with it! she was bargaining for some smuggled lace with one of your acquaintance, and I thought I could dispose of her money to better advantage,







Yes, to be sure! I knew I should never dispose of it in that manner with her consent,








So you'll be sure not to forget my chapeau a la Prusse, Mr Mincing?







And you'll make a delicate choice of the feathers?



The selection shall be elegant, madam



Yes I know, Mr Mincing, you're a charming man! And you let me have my pierrot a la Coblentz by nine in the morning, Mrs Tiffany?



To a minute, maim.



Madam, when you have a moment's leisure 



Be quiet, you fright; don't interrupt me! And my caraco a la hussar, and my bavaroises a la duchesse And put four rows of pearl in my turban,



Ver vell, me ladyship,



And you'll all come together, exactly at nine?







And don't forget the white ermine tippets, and the black fox muffs, and the Kamschatka furs that you mentioned, Mr Weazel!



I'll bring a fine assortment, madam,



And, and, and No; no you may all go I can think of nothing else I shall remember more tomorrow,


  20Hatter and Furrier
Thank you, madam! All-together



Very much obliged to you maim!



Dee ver good bon jour to me ladyship.



What was it you were saying, Mr Sulky? Pray child, what have you done with my purse?



Given it away, ma',



Given it away, minikin?







Given my purse away! To whom, for what purpose?



La, ma', only only to keep a poor woman from starving,



I protest, child, your grandmother has totally ruined you 



Not quite, madam: she has left the finishing to you,



What were you saying, Mr Sulky 



You won't give me leave to say any thing madam



You know you are a shocking troublesome man, Mr Sulky, I have a thousand things to remember, and can't bear teasing, it fatigues my spirits! so pray relate this very urgent business of yours in a single word What would you have 







Lord, what do you mean! Do you think I am in the commission?



Yes of sollies innumerable!



You are a sad savage, Mr. Sulky! And who is it you want justice for?



Your late husband's son, John Milford,



Now pray don't talk to me! You are a very intrusive person! You quite derange my ideas! I can think of nothing soft or satisfactory while you are present!



Will you hear me, madam?



I can't, I positively can't, it is an odious subject!



Nah, ma', how can you be so cross to my brother Milford 



Your brother, child Country education! how often, minikin, have I told you he is no brother of yours,



La, ma', he was your husband's son!



Yes, his Faugh! Odious word your brother,



Yes, that he is, For he is in distress,







And would you now, you who pretend to be a very prudent ridiculous kind of a person, wish to see me squander the wealth of my poor dear dead good man on Mr Milford, and his profligate companions?



Not I indeed, madam; though the profligate to whom you make love should happen to be one of them



Ha, ha, ha! Oh the monster, I make love! You have no eyes, Mr Sulky!  You are really blind! But I know whom you mean.



I mean young Dornton, madam,



To be sure you do, whom could you mean? Elegant youth! Rapturous thoughts!



I am sure, sir, young Mr. Dornton is no profligate,



 You are sure?



Yes that I am!







And it's very scandalous, very scandalous indeed, to say he is my ma's lover!







Because he is a fine genteel young gentleman; and you know ma' is 



Pray, minikin, be less flippant with your tongue.



Why la, ma', you yourself know you are too,



Go up to your chamber, child,











Blush indeed! Blush, ha, ha, ha; you are a very unaccountable creature, Mr Sulky Blush at the babbling of a child!



Who is your rival?



Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! my rival The poor minikin! my rival? But I have a message for you! Now do compose your features to softness and complacency! Look pleasant if you can, smile for once in your life!



Don't make love to me! I'll have nothing to say to you!



Ha, ha, ha! Love 



Yes, you make love to Dornton! Nay you make love to the booby Goldfinch! Even I am not secure in your company!











There she goes!  That's lucky, this way, sir,





Harry Obliging Abigail!   'sdeath, what all these tradesmen's bills?



All, sir, Mr Smith sent me after you with them,



When were they brought?



Some last night, but most this morning,



Ill news travels fast, and honesty is devilish industrious. Go round to them all, return their bills, and bid them come themselves to-day, has Mr Williams the hosier sent in his bill?







I thought as much Tell him to come with the rest, and on his life not fail,








Oh, Mr Dornton, I am glad to see you, do you know, I've got the song by heart that you was so good as to teach me!



And do you know, my charming Sophia, you are the most delightful, beautiful bewitching scholar that ever took lesson,



La, Mr Dornton. I'm sure I'm very stupid!



That you are all intelligence, all grace, all wit,



To be sure my ma' caught me singing it, and she was pettish; because you know it's all about love and ends with a happy marriage.







La, I can't tell, I suppose she wants to have all the marriage in the world to herself! It's her whole talk! I do believe she'd be married every morning that she rises, if any body would have her!



Think not of her, my sweet Sophia, but tell me 







I dare not ask,







Lest I should offend you,



Nay now, Mr Dornton, that is not right of you! I am never offended with any body, and I am sure I should not be offended with you! my grandma' always said I was the best tempered girl in the world What is it?



Were you ?  Did you ever know what it is to love?



La, now, how could you ask one such question? You know very well one must not tell! Besides, you know too one must not be in love 







Because Because I am but a girl my grandma' has told me a hundred times, it's a sin for any body to be in love before they be a woman grown, full one-and twenty; and I am not eighteen!



Love they say cannot be resisted,



Ah, but I have been taught better! It may be resisted Nobody need be in love unless they like: and so I won't be in love, for I won't wilfully do amiss.  No! I won't love any person though I should love him ever so dearly,



 Angelic innocence!  Right, lovely Sophia, guard your heart against seducers.



Do you know it is full five weeks since Valentine's day; and, because I'm not one-and-twenty, nobody sent me a valentine!



And did you expect one?



Nah , I can't say but I did think ! in Gloucestershire, if any young man happen to have a liking for a young woman, she is sure to hear of it on Valentine day. But perhaps Valentine day does not fall so soon here as it does in the country;



Why, it is possible you may yet receive a valentine.



Nay now, but don't you go to think that I am asking for one; for that would be very wrong of me, and I know better my grandma' told me I must never mention nor think of such things till I am a woman, full one-and-twenty grown; and that if I were to find such a thing at my window, or under my pillow or concealed in a plumcake 







Yes: I assure you I have heard of a valentine sent baked in a plum-cake And so if I had one that I must shew it to her. But you know she is in Gloucestershire; And I am sure I would not shew it to ma' for though she is all out and above forty, she would be as jealous as the vengeance! And indeed I would not receive such a thing for the world, no not from the finest man on earth, if I did not think him to be a true and faithful, true, true lover,



But how must he prove his faith and truth?



Why first he must love me very dearly! with all his heart and soul! And then he must be willing to wait till I am one-and-twenty,



And would not you love in return?



N yes, when I come to be one-and-twenty,







Oh no! I must not!



Surely you might if you pleased?



Oh but you must not persuade me to that! If you do I shall think you are a bad man, such as my grandma' warned me of!



and do you think me so?



Do I? No! I would not think you so for a thousand thousand golden guineas!



 Fascinating purity! what am I about? To▪ deceive or trifle with such unsuspecting affection would indeed be villiany!



 is she above? must see her 



La, I here that great, ridiculous. horse jockey oaf Goldfinch coming up!   Good bye Mr Dornton!



Heaven bless you, Sophia sweet Sophia, Heaven bless you, my lovely angel! Heigho!







 Is she here?



 I don't know, sir,




Hah; my tight one,







How you stare! An't I the go? That's your sort!



Ha, ha, ha 







Gone up to dress, and will not be down these two hours,



A hundred to eighty I'd sup up a string of twenty horses in less time than she takes to dress her fetlocks, plait her mane, trim her ears, and buckle on her body-clothes,

Ha, ha, ha! And your father was only a man of worth,



Kept a gig!  Knew nothing, Never drove four;



No, but he was a useful member of society,



A usef ! What's that?



Ha, ha, ha! A pertinent question,



A gentleman like me a useful member of society! Bet the long odds nobody ever heard of such a thing!



You have not acquired your character in the world for nothing, Charles,



World! What does the world say?



Strange things It says you have got into the hands of jockeys, Jews, and swindlers; and that, though old Goldfinch was in his day one of the richest men on 'Change, his son will shortly become poorer than the poorest black-leg at Newmarket,



Damn the world! 



With all my heart, damn the world, for it says little better of me,



Bet you seven to five the Eclipse colts against the Highflyers, the second spring meeting,



No, I have done with highflyer and eclipse too so you are in pursuit of the widow?



Full cry! Must have her!

All up with me else! If I don't marry the widow I must smash! I have secured the knowing one,



Whom do you mean, the maid?



Promised her a hundred on the wedding day.




My mistress can't see you at present, gentlemen,



Can't see me?  Take Harriet an airing in the phaeton,

Well, and what news? how is he? Very bad?















 I'm a lucky man!  Are you sure he is dead, Jacob?



I saw him with my own eyes, sir.



That's right, Jacob! I am a lucky man! And what say the people at the hotel? Do they know who he is?



Oh yes, sir! He was rich! A gentleman in his own country!



And did you take care they should not know you?



To be sure, sir! You had given me my lesson!



Ay, ay, Jacob! That's right! You are a fine boy! mind me, and I'll make a man of you! And you think they had heard nothing of his having called on me?

Money a thousand pound directly,



Fine talking, Mr. Goldfinch, money's a scarce commodity, times are ticklish!



Tellee I must have it,



Give me but good security, and you know I'm your friend,



Yes, good security and fifty per cent!



Why look you there now, for all you know the last annuity I had of you, I gave a full hundred more than was offered by your friend Aaron, the Jew:



My friend? Your friend! You collogue together,



Hear you now! For all you know I have always been your friend; always supplied you with money, have not I? And when I saw you running to ruin, I never told you of it, did I? I was willing to make all things easy!



Easy enough, you have pretty well 'eased me!



There is your companion Jack Milford; I shall be a heavy loser by him!



Ah! It's all up with poor Jack, he's sixed at last



What do you mean?



Old Dornton has sent the Nab▪man after him!











 Jacob!  Run as fast as you can to my good friend Mr Strawshoe, the attorney, and tell him to take out detainders for all the debts I have bought up against Mr Milford! make haste!







I thought you were Jack Milford's friend too!



So I am, Mr Goldfinch; but I must provide for my family,



Come, come! The bit! Tellee I want the coal directly! sale at Tattersall's to-morrow morning! Three Herod brood mares with each an eclipse colt, would not lose 'em for all Lombard-street! so will you let me have the bit?



Dear, dear! I tell you I can't Mr Goldfinch,



Then some other Jew must,



Jew! hear you, hear you, this it is to be the friend of an ungrateful spendthrift, calls me Jew! I who go to morning prayers every day of my life, and three times to tabernacle on a Sunday!







Nay but stay, Mr Goldfinch, stay I want to talk to you I have a scheme to make a man of you,



What? Bind me 'prentice to a usurer,



Pshaw! you are in pursuit of the widow Warren







Now what will you give me, and I'll secure her to you,















I have a deed in my power, I won't tell you what, but I have it, by which I can make her marry the man I please, or remain a widow all her life; and that I am sure she will never do if she can help it,















Not for twenty thousand pounds depend upon me, I have it, I tell you I'm your friend, and you shall have her, that is on proper conditions If not, Mr Goldfinch, you shall not have her,



Indeed, old Judas, well what are your conditions?



I find the late alderman died worth a hundred and fifty thousand pounds,







Every farthing, Mr Goldfinch! And my conscience tells me that, risk and character and all considered, I must come in for my thirds,



Your conscience tells you that?



Yes, it does, Mr Goldfinch Fifty thousand is a fair price,



For the soul of a miser,



If you'll join me, say so,







Not a farthing less! What, will there not be a hundred thousand remaining?



Why that's true it will cut a fine dash.



To be sure it will! Come with me! I'll draw up a sketch of an agreement. After which we must fight cunning The widow is a vain weak woman you must get her written promise,







Under her own hand; with a good round penalty in case of forfeiture,



Well said, old one!



Not less than twenty thousand pounds! A jury would grant half!



Why you're a good one!



That would secure something, and we would snack,



Dammee you're a deep one,



Ah, ha, ha! Do you think I am, Mr Goldfinch signed on a stamp!



You know a thing or two:



Ah, ha, ha, ha; do you think I do, Mr Goldfinch,



You can teach 'em to bite the bubble,



Ah, ha, ha, ha! you joke, Mr Goldfinch, you joke.



But the devil will have you at last!



Lord forbid, Mr Goldfinch, don't terrify me I hate the devil, Mr Goldfinch; indeed I do; I hate the name of him! Heaven keep me out of his fiery clutches.



No: he has you safe enough, bait his trap but with a guinea, and he is sure to find you nibbling 



Don't talk about the devil, Mr Goldfinch, pray don't; but think about the widow secure her,



I must have the coal though this evening:



Don't lose a moment, Mr Goldfinch;



Must not lose the eclipse colts 



Pshaw, Mr Goldfinch, think less of the colts and more of the widow, get her promise black and white, Goldfinch going



 Tellee I must have 'em,



All will then be safe!

Indeed but don't you think it, I would not give this tiny bit of paper, no, not for a diamond as big as big as the whole world, And if you were to téll ma', and she were to take it from me, I'd never love you, nor forgive you, as long as I live.



Oh but indeed, miss, I'm not obliged to keep secrets for nothing,









You are a very shocking person, Mr Sulky, The wild man of the woods broke loose, do return to your keeper, good Orang Outang; and don't go about to terrify the children!



I tell you, madam, Mr Milford is arrested,







Locked up at a bailiff's in the next street,







And pray now what is that to me,







I am not arrested,











The pitiless only should feel pain. The stonyhearted alone should be enclosed by walls of stone,



Don't be cross with ma', sir; I'm sure she'll release my brother,



You are sure, minikin!



Yes, ma'; for I am sure no soul on earth would suffer a fellow creature to lie and pine to death, in a frightful dark dungeon, and fed with bread and water:



Your late husband recommended the payment of his son's debts,











But leaving it to my own prudence,







Which prudence I shall follow,



It will be the first time in your life You never yet followed prudence, you always ran before it;



Nay come, dear ma', I am sure you have a pitiful heart! I am sure you could not rest in your bed if my poor brother was in prison!



Hold your prattle, child,



Ah! I'm sure you'll make him happy, and pay his debts!















La, dear sir, have patience 











I am glad the monster is gone! He is a very intolerable person! Pray, Jenny, how did it happen that Mr. Dornton went away without seeing me?


Servant, Mr Silky, madam.


Leave us, Jenny.  So, Mr Silky What is this very urgent business of yours?



 Are we safe, madam? Will nobody interrupt us; nobody over-hear us?



No, no But what is the meaning of this caution?



 Do you know this hand-writing, madam?



Ah! It is my poor old dear man's, I see.



You have heard of a will he left in France?



Pshaw! Will indeed? He left no will!



Yes, he did, madam.



I won't believe it! He loved me too well to rob me of a single guinea! Poor simple soul! I was his darling!



His darling madam! With your permission, I will just read a single clause in which his darling is mentioned! Look, madam; it is thealderman's hand! But as I have sometimes painfully suspected the excessive affection which my said wife, Winifred Warren, professed for me during my decline, and that the solemn protestations she made never to marry again▪ should she survive me, were both done with sinister views, it is my will that, should she marry, or give a legal promise of marriage, written or verbal, that she shall be cut off with an annuity of six hundred a year; and the residue of my effects in that case to be equally divided between my natural son, John Milford, and my wife's daughter, Sophia Freelove.



Six hundred a year! An old dotard! To imagine that a woman of my elegant ideas could exist on six hundred a year! Brute! Monster! I hate him now as heartily as when he was alive: But pray, sir, how came you by this will?



Why it was odd enough! And yet easy enough! My name is Silky, madam 







And you know the executor's name is Sulky 







The gentleman that delivered it only made a mistake of a letter, and give it to Mr. Silky instead of to Mr. Sulky!



And where is that gentleman?



Ah, poor man! He is dead!







And gone! Was taken ill the very night he parted from me, went to his hotel, was put to bed in a high fever, and carried off in less than a week.



And does Mr Sulky know of this will being delivered?



Not a syllable! It's all close and smooth!



So much the better Come, give it me, and 



Excuse me there, madam! I can't do that!







My conscience won't let me! I must provide for my family!



And pray what provision is this will to make for your family, Mr Silky?



Why, madam. I have a proposal You know the power of your own charms!



Which I believe is more than you do, Mr Silky 



Hah! Don't say so, madam! Don't say so! Would I were a handsome, rich and wellborn youth! But you know Mr Goldfinch? Ah, ha, ha, ha! I could tell you a secr•t!



What, that he is dying for me, I suppose?



Ah! So smitten! Talks of nothing else!



And is that any secret, think you?



The alderman I find died worth more than a plum and a half 







I have talked the matter over with my friend, Mr Goldfinch, and he thinks it but reasonable, that for a secret of so much importance, which would almost sweep the whole away, I should receive one third.



Fifty thousand pounds, Mr Silky?



I can't take less.



Why you are a greater rogue than even I thought you!



Lord, madam, it's no roguery! It's only a knowledge of the world! A young husband and a hundred thousand pounds, or poor six hundred a year without any husband!



You are a very shocking old miser▪ Mr Silky! A very repulsive sort of a person! What heart you had is turned to stone! You are insensible of the power of a pair of fine eyes! But I have made a conquest that places me beyond your reach I mean to marry Mr Dornton!



 What! Old Mr Dornton, madam?



Old Mr Dornton, man? I never saw the figure in my life! No! The gay and gallant young Mr Dornton! The pride of the city, and the lawful monarch of my bleeding heart!



Ha▪ ha, ha! Young Mr Dornton!



So you may take your will and light your fires with it! You will not make a penny of it in any other way. Mr. Sulky, the executor is Mr. Dornton's partner, and when I marry Mr Dornton he will never inflict the absurd penalty.



Ha, ha, ha! No, madam! When you marry Mr Dornton, that he certainly never will! But if any accident should happen to prevent the match, you will then let me here from you?



Lord▪ good man! Don't mention the horrid idea? Do leave me to my delightful meditations! I would indulge in soft sensibility and dreams of bliss; and not be disturbed by dead men's wills, or the sordid extortions of an avaricious old rogue!
















As I was saying, Jenny, pray how did it happeu that Mr, Dornton went away without seeing me?



Indeed ma'am, I don't know.







I'm sure, ma'am, I wonder how you can like him better than Mr. Goldfinch!



Mr, Goldfinch is very well, Jenny But Mr, Dornton! Oh incomparable!



I am sure, ma'am, if I was a rich lady, and a handsome lady, and a fine lady, like you, I should say Mr. Goldfinch for my money!



Should you, Jenny? Well, I don't know  



 Tellee I must see her.



As I live, here he comes! He is such a boisterous person!  How do I look Jenny? I protest my face is of all colours!



 You had better go up to your toilette for a minute.



That smooth tongued old extortioner has put me into such a flutter Don't let him go Jenny.







I'll not stay too long.




Here I am All alive.



Dear! What's the matter?



Safe and sound! Fine kick up!



Have you been thrown?



Pitched five-and-twenty feet into a ditch Souse!







Pretty commence! No matter Limbs whole Heart sound That's your sort!

'Tis very well your neck's not broke!



Little stiff No matter Damn all dancingmasters and their umbrellas!



You had better have been here. Mr Goldfinch. You stand so long, shilly shally, that you'll be cut out at last, If you had but a licence now in your pocket, I'd undertake to have you married in half an hour!



Do you think so?



Think? I'm sure on't,



Dammee, I'll post away and get one must not lose her; the game's up if I do must have her; be true to me, and I'll secure you the hundred, I'll be back from the Commons in a smack!

You have a taste for these things, Mr Goldfinch,



Taste, believe I have who more? Phaetons and curricles, parks and pleasure-grounds up hill and down highways and bye-ways" I'm the boy that shall drive you,



Pardon me, Mr Goldfinch; if a certain event were by the wise disposition of providence to take place, I should think proper to drive,



You drive, if you do damn me;







I'm christened and called Charles Charles Goldfinch The knowing Lad that's not to be had winter and summer Fair weather and foul Low ruts

If retrospect and and affection threw no other obstacles in the way yet the the world prudence,



The world! prudence, damn▪ the world, damn prudence,







The world nor nobody else has nothing to do with neither your prudence nor mine, we'll be married immediately,



Immediately, Mr. Goldfinch.! I  







Nay, Mr Goldfinch I do not absolutely renunciate but I wish



It was over Know▪ you do go for the licence



Pray Dear Mr Goldfinch 



Go for the licence, I tellee.











Mr Goldfinch! I declare  


Mr. DORNTON, and Mr SMITH.


Still the same hurry, the same crowd, Mr Smith,



Much the same sir, the house never experienced a day like this! Mr Sulky, thinks we shall never get through











Unprincipled prodigal! my son owes his ruin to him alone. But he shall suffer,



My young master's tradesmen are waiting,



Bid them come in,  All my
  43
own fault, my own fond folly! Denied him nothing, encouraged him to spend; and now the unnatural father can coolly think of turning him on the wide pitiless world; there to starve, pine in a prison, rot in dungeons, among agues, rheums and loath someness!

Re-enter Mr SMITH followed by Tradesmen.






Zounds! what an army A vile thoughtless profligate! "Yes, yes, misery be his portion; he merits it;"




 You are wanted in the counting-house sir,



Very well, I'll be with you in a moment, gentlemen abandoned spendthrift,




I don't like all this, what does it mean?







He has been a good customer None of your punctual paymasters, that look over their accounts,



Oh, a different thing! Nothing to be got by them Always take care to affront them,



Perhaps it is a trick of the old gentleman, to inspect into our charges;



I don't like that rather hear of any tax than of taxing my bill.



Humph! Tradesmen begin to understand these things, and allow a reasonable profit!



Can't have less than fifty per cent. for retail credit trade▪



To be sure not; if a man would live in style, and save a fortune as he ought:



Hush, mind All devilish hard run,







Not a guinea in the house! To-morrow's Saturday Hem!




Your servant, gentlemen, your servant. Pray how happens it that you bring your accounts in here



We received notice, sir,



You have none of you any demands upon me?



Happy to serve you sir,



We shall all be glad of your custom sir,







And do you come expecting to be paid?



Money, sir, is always agreeable,



Tradesmen find it a scarce commodity:



Bills come round quick,







For my part, I always give a gentleman, who is a gentleman▪ his own time.



I understand you! And what are you, sir, who seem to stand apart from the rest?



A hosier, sir, I am unworthy the company of these honest gentlemen, who live in style, I never affront a punctual paymaster▪ not I: and, what they will think strange, I get more by those who do look over their bills, than those who do not,















And what may be the amount of your bill, sir?



A trisle, for which I have no right to ask,



No right! what do you mean?



Your son, sir, made me what I am; redeemed me and my family from ruin; and it would be an ill requital of his goodness to come here, like a dun, at such a time as this; when I would rather, if that could help him, give him every shilling I have in the world,



Would you? Would you?  You look like an honest man! But what do you do here then?



Mr Dornton, sir, knew I should be unwilling to come, and sent me word he would never speak to me more if I did not: and, rather than offend him, I would even come here on a business like this,



 You are an honest fellow ! An unaccountable and so Harry has been your friend?



Yes sir; a liberal-minded friend; for he lent me money, though I was sincere enough to tell him of his faults.



Zounds sir, how came you to be a weaver of stockings?



I don't know, sir, how I came to be at all; I only know that here I am,







I am not fond of titles, sir I'm a man,



Why is it not a shame, now, that the soul of Socrates should have crept and hid itself in the body of a stocking-weaver? give me your bill,







Give me your bill, I tell you! I'll pay this bill myself:



I cannot, must not, sir.



Sir, I insist on   so sir,  why have you assembled these people into whose debt you have dishonestly run, wanting the power to pay; and who have as dishonestly trusted you, hoping to profit exorbitantly by your extravagance?



Oh, fir, you don't know them! They are very complaisant, indulgent kind of people. Are not you, gentlemen?











Be kind enough to wait a few minutes without, my good friends.  Mr, Williams  







How dare you introduce this swarm of locusts here? How dare you?



 Despair, sir, is a dauntless hero.



Have you the effrontery to suppose that I can or shall pay them? What is it you mean?



To let you see I have creditors.







Some of them: but that is my fault They must be paid.







The innocent must not suffer for the guilty.



You will die in an alms-house!



May be so; but the orphan's and the widow's curse shall not meet me there!



Harry! Zounds!  Paid! Whom do you mean to rob?



My name is Dornton, sir.



Are you not ? 







Quit the room! Begone!



You are the best of men, sir, and I ! But I hate whining. Repentance is a pitiful scoundrel, that
  46
never brought▪ back a single yesterday. Amendment is a fellow of more mettle But it is too late Suffer I ought, and suffer I must my debts of honour discharged, do not let my tradesmen go unpaid.



You have ruined me!



The whole is but five thousand pounds!



But? The counter is loaded with the destruction you▪ have brought upon us all!



No, no I have been a sad fellow, but not even my extravagance can shake this house.





Bills are pouring in so fast upon us we shall never get through!



 What! What is that you say?



We have paid our▪light gold so often over that the people are very surly!



Pay it no more! Sell it instantly▪ for what it is worth, disburse the last guinea, and shut up the doors!



 Are you serious?







 Are you serious, I say? Is it not some trick to impose upon me?







 Tol de rol My father! Sir!  Is it possible? Disgraced? Ruined? In reality ruined? By me? Are these things so? Tol de rol 



Harry! How you look! You frighten me!



 It shall be done!



What do you mean? Calm yourself, Harry!



















Don't droop!  Don't despair! I'll find relief   first to my friend he cannot fail? But if he should! why ay, then to Megaera! I will marry her, in such a cause, were she fifty widows, and fifty furies!







I am calm! Very calm it shall be done don't be dejected You are my father you were the first of men in the first of cities revered by the good and respected
  47
by the great you flourished profperously! But you had a son! I remember it!



Why do you roll your eyes Harry,



I won't be long away,



Stay where you are, Harry!  All will be well, I am very happy, do not leave me, I am very happy! indeed I am Harry, very happy!



Tol de rol heaven bless you, sir! You are a worthy gentleman, I'll not be long:



Hear me, Harry I'm very happy!




Mr Smith, sir, desires to know whether we may send to the Bank for a thousand pounds worth of silver











Mr SILKY and JACOB.


Mr Goldfinch not called yet, Jacob?







Nor any message from the widow?







See who knocks, Jacob,  I dare say it is one or t'other! They must come to me at last,




 Are you sure he is at home?











Ah! my dear Mr Dornton, how do you do? I hope you are very well! I am exceedingly glad to see you! this call is so kind, so condescending, it gives me infinite pleasure,



Mr Silky, you must instantly grant me a favour,



A favour, what is it? How can I serve you? I would run to the world's end,



You must exert your whole friendship!



Friendship, sir? Say duty, 'twas you that made a man of me! I should have been ruined, in the Bench, I know not where or what, had you not come forward
  48
and supported me at the critical moment! And now I can defy the world,



 Hear me, I know you can,



Oh yes! The sum you lent me, a lucky speculation, five years of continual good fortune, and other little lifts have made me, I won't say what But, your father and perhaps another or two excepted, I say perhaps, I'll shew my head with the proudest of 'em



Why then I am a fortunate man!



To be sure you are! how can I serve you? what can I do? Make me happy!



You can rescue me from phrensy!



Can I? I am proud! Infinitely happy! What? How? I am a lucky fellow! Tell me which way? Where can I run? What can I do?



 The request is serious trying!



So much the better! So much the better! Whom would I serve, if not you? You! The son of the first man in the city!







I don't! You are, you are! Dornton and Co. may challenge the world, the house of Hope perhaps excepted!











Our house is in danger of stopping payment!







My follies are the cause!







I have not been used to ask▪favours but 







Scorn me, curse me, spurn me, but save my father!







What means this alteration in your countenance?



Oh dear, no! Ha, ha, ha! Not in the least! Ha, ha, ha! I assure you, I, I, I 



I have told you our situation. Yourself and two other friends must jointly support my father, by your credit, to the amount of fifty thousand pounds Mark me! Must!



Fifty thousand pounds, Mr. Dornton! Fifty thousand pounds! Are you dreaming? Me? Fifty thousand pounds! Me? Or half the sum? Or a fifth of the sum Me!



Prevaricating scound ! Hear me, sir!







I must be calm   Are you not a ! I say Sir You have yourself informed me of your ability, and I must insist, observe sir! I insist on your immediate performance of this act of duty!



Duty, and fifty thousand pounds! Are you made Mr. Dornton? Are you mad? Or do you think me mad?



I think you the basest of wretches!



Nay, Mr. Dornton, I would do any thing to serve you! Any thing, I protest to Heaven! Would go any where, run 



Of my errands, wipe my shoes! Any dirty menial office that cost you nothing And this you call shewing your gratitude?



Is it not, Mr Dornton?



 And will you give no help to the house



Nay, Mr. Dornton! 



After the favours you have been for many years receiving, the professions you have been daily making, and the wealth you have by these means been hourly acquiring! Will you not, sir?



 Nay, Mr. Dornton !



Will you not, sir?



Don't hurt a poor old man! I can't!







Bless my heart! Stop payment? The house of Dornton! Fifty thousand pounds? I declare I am all of a tremble! James! William!


Have we any bills on the house of Dornton?


I have just been examining the books, sir, We have bills to the amount of 



How much? How much? A thousand pounds?







Three! Three thousand? Bless my heart!



We heard the news the very moment after young Mr. Dornton came in!



Run, pay the bills away!







Any where! Any body will take 'em! Run with them to my dear friend, Mr Smallware; it is too far for him to have heard of the crash. Begone! Don't leave
  50










A WAY, Handmaid of Hecate! Fly!



Lord, sir, you don't mean as you say!



Will you begone, Cerberea? Invite my Goddess to descend in a golden shower, and suddently relieve these racking doubts.



Goddess! I knew you meant miss Sophy!



Prime tormentrix to the Furies, begone!



What, sir, to my old Mistress?



Hear you? Yes! I want an old Mistress, with her old gold, instantly to relieve an injured old man Tol de rol Vanish, daughter of Nox! Tell her what a gay and love sick humour I am in Tol de rol.








Widow! Here am I! Phaeton the second hurled from my flaming car! I come burning with fierce desires, devoutly bent on committing the deadly sin of matrimony! May these things be? Speak, my saving Angel!



Fie upon you! How can you throw one into such insuperable trepidation of spirits?



Will you have me? Pronounce but the blessed Yes, and I am thine for ever and for aye.



Dear Mr Dornton ! You I 



Ay, ay I know very well The formal No, the crimson blush, the half-consenting side-glance, the
  51
hesitating Yes, the palpitation violent We'll suppose them all There, there! I have acted them over, and parson's tragical farce is going to begin!



Nay, but ! Dear Mr Dornton !

Ay, sir! I have had full information of your mean arts! It was necessary I should be out of the way, that your designs on Mrs. Warren might meet no interruption!

A vile, eternal falsehood!



Enter OFFICER with papers and writs,

I tell you we are busy, and must not be interrupted!  Mr. Milford, you shall hear from me immediately.




 What were those papers? Surely I have not been rash? Nobody but his father could have brought my creditors thus on me all at once? He seemed half drunk or half frantic! Said he was ruined, disinherited Talked something of to-morrow What could the purport of his coming be?  Well, sir?



Here is a note, sir.











 'I understand you are liberty' How! At liberty? I shall walk up to Hyde Park: you will find me at the Ring at six Exactly at six' At liberty?



Your debts are all dischared.



Impossible! Which way? By whom?



Why, sir That is 



No hesitation, but tell me by whom?



Sir I thought I perceived some anger between you and the young gentleman?



Ask no questions, sir; make no delays! Tell me who has paid my debts? Tell me the truth Consequences you do not suspect depend upon your answer!



I perceive, sir, there has been some warmth between you: and though the young gentleman made me promise silence and secrecy.









And the danger not yet past?



Far from it! Mr. Sulky has twice brought us supplies, and is gone a third time.



Brave spirit! He would coin his heart! My father supports it nobly?



He is anxious only for you.



Well▪ well! Ha▪ ha, ha! Tol lol I'll bring him relief Comfort him, assure him of it! Ay, hear me heaven and ! To-night it is too late, but to-morrow all shall be well! Excellent well!



 You will marry the widow?



Have you heard? Ay, boy, ay! We'll marry! "I will go and prepare her We'll marry!" Early in the morning that all may be safe.



Will that be right?








Where is Harry? Did not I hear his voice?



He is this moment gone, sir.







Do you not suspect where, sir?



 Suspect! What? Speak?



To the widow Warren's.











Marry! The widow Warren!



And save the house by her fortune.



Generous Harry! Noble affectionate boy! I'd perish first!



He seems very resolute He has already had six thousand pounds of her.



Marry her? I shall go mad! Where is Mr. Sulky?



He is just returned, I hear him in the compting-house,



Tell him I wish to speak with him,  Harry Dornton and the widow Warren? I shall die in Bedlam!  Are we safe, Mr Sulky?







What bank have we to begin to-morrow?



I can't tell I fear not thirty thousand.



Mr Sulky, you you have this day shewn yourself an active partner, and a sincere friend.







I have long esteemed you; I esteem you more and more,







My son Harry   You are a very good man, Mr Sulky; a compassionate man, though you don't look so,







'Tis pity to see so noble a youth I am sure you would not wish him any harm, Mr Sulky, I am sure you would not!







Harry Dornton, would you would you would you, Mr Sulky?







Nay, I did not mean to be unkind, Mr Sulky, you know I did not shall we not venture one step more to save him?



Save? Impossible! Ruin only can reform him▪ total ruin.



You mistake, Mr Sulky, his own misfortunes little affected him, but mine he is struck to the heart I know him▪







Struck to the heart I'm sure on't! he'll be a good man! A great man,







You know the widow Warren, Mr Sulky?







I never saw her in my life I hear she is full forty, her manners absurd, her character cruel, and her morals 







Six thousand pounds at this moment is a great sum! I own it! But do you think I ought not to venture?







To To take it from our bank?







For For the the relief of Harry Dornton?



What you please, take all! what is it to me?



Nay, but, Mr Sulky, you surely don't see the thing in the right light?



I can starve, like the rest!



 Very well▪ Mr Sulky, very well: I perceive you can be interested, and and 







Very well, Mr Sulky, very well!



I can stare bankruptcy in the face as stedfastly as you can.



Ay, ay. No doubt! The world is all alike! I am an old fool, and so shall live and die:



Why do you ask my advice? Take the money. Empty the coffers! Pour it all into his hat, give him guineas to play at chuck farthing, and bank bills to curl his hair.



Very well, Mr Sulky: Friendship, generosity, a sense of justice. Oh, it's all a farce,







 Very well, sir: Very well,  Is the carriage ready?







 So, Mr Sulky, you could see him married to this widow, to whom you have so often as well as now given the worst of character, rather than incur a little more risk for your friend.















The widow Warren, I tell you!







Yes, and Harry Dornton,







Immediately, with unexampled affection, to save me who am old and worthless, he would devote his youth, his great quailities, and his noble heart, to all the torments which such a marriage and such a woman can inflict







Are you serious, Mr Sulky,



Take the money, away, begone! I would indeed starve, inchmeal, rather than he should marry her,



Mr Sulky, you are a worthy man, a true friend.












So, miss! here's your mamma just coming down,



 Is she dressed?



Oh yes! I have decorationed her out like any king's coach horse,







With her ribbands and ringlets stuck about and dangle-ating down her back and all here 







Tight laced "Thomas called up to help." 



It's all very well! But it will be no wedding,



 I hope not;



He told her to her face that he loved me, and offered to give her the money back He'll never have her And if he does I don't care I know I shall die broken-hearted, but I don't care I'll tell all to my dear grandma', for I'll not stay in this wicked city No i he shan't see me pine away I know my ghost will haunt him; but I can't help it. I never wished him any harm, and had he but been true-hearted and have waited for me, I would But it's no matter He shan't see a tear that I shed, nor hear the least sigh that I heave.





 Well, ma'am ! I declare you're a pictur!



Do you think I look tolerably, Jenny?  Shall I do execution? What is the matter, child?



Mark my words, he'll never have you!












Run, Jenny, see who it is!  Go up to your chamber, child.



No! I will stay here.



Begone to your chamber, I say, miss!



Beat me if you please, kill me, but I will not!




Here's an elderly gentleman, ma'am, asks to speak to you.



Will you begone, miss?







How is he dressed?























 Does he look like a parson, Jenny?



Why ma'am he is a soberly, snug, jobationlooking man enough.



Let him be shewn in I dare say it is the Divine!

Footman introduces Mr. DORNTON.

Madam? None, I thank you.

Sir! Oh! You are intimate With the family?

Sometimes To my great regret, I have sometimes found him a very absurd old gentleman,



I am sorry for it Because as I am soon to become hymeneally his intimate relation I I !












Ha, I dare not say too much in his favour,

 Nor he for you, madam!

Cloth again! I don't know what you mean

Well, my kind widow!  My loving compassionate widow! I am come post haste to cast myself once more on your bounty,

HARRY DORNTON, looking at his watch.


How long must I wait? I see nothing of Milford I'll cut off that bailiff's ears if he have betrayed me. 












 What do you do here, Harry?



Sir I I want air.



So do I A pretty dance you have led me What brought you hither?   Where's the money you had of the widow?  Where's the money, Harry?















And your creditors not paid?  And your creditors not paid?







 I suspected I foreboded this!  He has been at some gaming house, lost all, quarrelled and came here to put a miserable end to a miserable existence! Oh, who would be a father! 




I am sent on an April-day kind of errand here. I think this is what they call the Ring   71
Hey! Who is this?  Pray Sir Is your name Dornton?







Then I am right Mr Milford, sir, has sent me this note.



 It is for me, sir!



How do you know, Harry?



Sir, I am certain! I must beg !



This is no time for ceremony! Dear Harry, forgive the provocation I have given you; forget the wrong I have done your father Me! I will submit to any disgrace rather than lift my hand against your life I would have come and apologised even on my knees, but I am prevented J. Milford. Why Harry! What! What is this? Tell me Tell me Is it in paying Milford's debts you have expended the money?







 But how had he wronged me? Why did you come here to fight him?



Sir He he spoke disrespectfully of you.








 My father! 







Dear sir, let us fly to console poor Milford!










The fool Go ldfinch himself informed me, sir, that Silky is to receive fifty thousand pounds for his consent!



Fifty thousand! Zounds! Why then the old scoundrel must have got possession of the will.



Which is ind ubitably meant to be destroyed. Goldfinch is just returned with Silky. They are now with
  72
the widow, all in high glee, and are coming up here immediately, no doubt to settle the business in private.



What can be done?



We must hide ourselves somewhere, and spring upon them.



I hate hiding! It's deceit, and deceit is the resource of a rascal.



But there is no avoiding it! We cannot get legal assistance in time! Here are two closets! Do you go into one, and I'll shut myself up in the other. We shall hear what they are about, and can burst upon them at the proper moment.



Well, if it must be so But it's a vile, paltry refuge!



I hear them coming! Make haste!






Ha, ha, ha! I told you, madam, I should hear from you when you wanted me! I knew it must come to that! But you are a lucky man. Mr Goldfinch, and I'am a lucky man! ay and you are a lucky woman too, madam! We are all in luck!



Ay dammee, old one, you have been concerned in many a good thing in your time!



Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha! To be sure I have! I must provide for my family, Mr. Goldfinch!



It is indeed a fortunate event! Do you not participate my raptures, Mr Goldfinch?



To be sure It's a deep scheme! It's knowing a thing or two! Hay, old one? Pigeoning the Green horns!



All so safe too, so snug! I am so pleased, and so happy! It's all our own! Not a soul will know of it but our three selves!



Oh yes One more, old one 



 Ay! Who? Who?







Lord! Mr Goldfinch, don't terrify me!



To be sure, it must be owned you are a shocking old rogue, Mr Silky! But there is no doing without you So make haste with your deeds and your extortions; for really we should be glad to be rid of your company 



Well, well, I'm ready I'll not long interrupt your amorous haste. I am a man of business! I expected how it would be, and have a legal instrument here, ready drawn up by my own hand; which, when it is signed and sealed, will make all safe!



But where is the will?



Oh I have it First however let us be secure. 



You're an old trader in sin! There's no being too deep for you!



Ah, ha, ha, ha! Do you think so, Mr Goldfinch?



But I should like to see you on your death-bed!




Bless my soul! What's that?



Zounds! Odd enough! I believe he's coming for you before your time!



It was very strange!



I declare I am all of a tremble!



Come, come, let us get the shocking business over! Where is the will?



Don't shake so man!



Well, well! First sign the bond!  Lord have mercy upon me!







Save me, Mr Goldfinch!







Pshaw! Zounds, it is only some cat in the closet!



I heard it in both the closets!



Why then there are two cats! Come! I'll sign 












And here is the will, which, that all may be safe, we will immediately commit to the flames. 



Lord have mercy upon us!



My hair stands an end!




Save me, Mr. Goldfinch! Protect me! Ah!





Dear, ma', what's the matter?



Where is the will?  Give it me, you old scoundrel! Give it me this instant, or I'll throttle you!




So, gentlemen! You are a pretty pair of knaves!



And you are a very worthy lady!



Don't talk to me, man! Don't talk to me! I shall never recover my senses again!



What has happened, gentlemen? How came you thus all locked up together?



Are you here, Mr. Silky?



Yes! There's the honest, grateful, friendly Mr. Silky! Who would betray his friends, plunder the living, and defraud the dead, for the ease of his conscience, and to provide for his family!



Old one! You're done up!



And here is the girlish old coquette, who would rob her daughter and leave her husband's son, to rot in a dungeon, that she might marry the first fool she could find.



Widow! You are dished!  Lost your last chance!



A broken gamester, nurtured in idleness, ignorance, and dissipation, whose ridings, racings, and drivings are over, and whose whole train of horses, dogs, curricles, phaetons, and fooleries must come to the hammer immediately, is no great loss.



Oh, la! And what is coming to the hammer?



Oh, the hammer is an instrument by which Folly is publickly knocked down to the best bidder; after which she rises, gambols, whisks away, makes a short flying tour, and gallops back to be publickly knocked down again.



"Dear! Poor Mr Goldfinch,"



I knew your father, sir: 'tis happy for him that he is dead! If you will forsake these courses and apply to trade 







And now, madam 



Keep off, monster! You smell of malice, cruelty and persecution!



No, madam: I smell of honesty! A drug you nauseate, but with which you must forcibly be dosed; I have glanced over the will, and find I have the power:



Let me go, goblin! You are a hideous person, and I hate the sight of you! Your breast is flint! Flint! Unfeeling Gorgon, and I abominate you:




Nah, you are a kind, good, cross old soul; and I am sure you will forgive my poor ma', we ought all to forget and forgive: Ought not we, Mr Dornton,



 do you hear her, sir?



Harry has told me of your innocent, pure, and unsuspecting heart I love you for having called me an ugly monster;



 La, Mr Dornton, how could you!



Harry Give me your hand You have a generous and a noble nature! But your generosity would have proved more pernicious than even your dissipation. No misfortunes, no not the beggary and ruin of a father, could justify so unpricipled a marriage!



And now  my friend,











Whoo! If you wish to get another word from me to night, have done. I hate fawning!



Ah, Mr Sulky, you will have your humour,



The undiscriminating generosity of this young man supported you in your day of distress; for which, serpent-like, you turned to sting your preserver,



Ah, you will have your humour,



Yes; and it is my humour to see that your villany shall be exposed in its true colours. Hypocrisy, falsehood, and fraud, are your familiars. To screen
  76〈1 page duplicate〉  76
your avarice, you made it believed that this gentleman had been the cause of lodging the detainders, and had done the dirty work of which even you were ashamed. But the creditors receive their full demand.



The proposal is just. Listen to that worthy man; and if you can, be honest with a good grace. Every thing will then be readily adjusted, and I hope to the satisfaction of all parties.
