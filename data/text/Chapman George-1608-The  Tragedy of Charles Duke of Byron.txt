Byron fall in so traitorous a relapse 
allege for our ingratitude what office 
title of honour and what admiration 
can France afford he that it pour not on 
when he be scarce arrive at forty year 
he run through all chief dignity of France 
at fourteen year of age he be make colonel 
to all the swiss serve then in Flanders 
soon after he be Marshal of the camp 
and short after Marshal general 
he be receive high admiral of France 
in that our parliament we hold at Tours 
Marshal of France in that we hold at Paris 
and at the siege of Amiens he acknowledge 
none his superior but ourself the king 
though I have there the prince of the blood 
I make he my lieutenant general 
declare he joint the prime peer of France 
and raise his barony into a duchy 

and yet my lord all this can not allay 
the fatal thirst of his ambition 
for some have hear he say he will not die 
till on the wing of valour he have reach 
one degree high and have see his head 
set on the royal quarter of a crown 
yea at so unbelieved a pitch he aim 
that he have say his heart will still complain 
till he aspire the style of sovereign 
and from what ground my lord rise all the levy 
now make in Italy from whence shall spring 
the warlike humour of the count Fuentes 
the restless stir of the duke of Savoy 
the discontent the Spaniard entertain 
with such a threaten fury when he hear 
the prejudicial condition 
propose he in the treaty hold at Veruins 
and many other beauerie this way aim 
but from some hope of inward aid from hence 
and that all this direct aim at you 
your highness have by one intelligence 
good cause to think which be your late advice 
that the sea army now prepare at Naples 
have a intend enterprise on Provence 
although the cunning Spaniard give it out 
that all be for Algiers 

I must believe 
that without treason breed in our own breast 
Spain affair be not in so good estate 
to aim at any action against France 
and if Byron shall be their instrument 
his alter disposition can not grow 
so far wide in a instant nor resign 
his valour to these lawless resolution 
upon the sudden nor without some charm 
of foreign hope and flattery sing to he 
but far it fly my thought that such a spirit 
so active valiant and vigilant 
can see itself transform with such wild fury 
and like a dream it show to my conceit 
that he who by himself have win such honour 
and he to who his father leave so much 
he that still daily reap so much from i 
and know he may increase it to more proof 
from i than any other foreign king 
shall quite against the stream of all religion 
honour and reason take a course so foul 
and neither keep his oath nor save his soul 
can the poor keep of a citadel 
which I deny to be at his disposure 
make he forgo the whole strength of his honour 
it be impossible though the violence 
of his hot spirit make he make attempt 
upon our person for deny he 
yet well I find his loyal judgement serve 
to keep it from effect beside be offer 
two hundred thousand crown in yearly pension 
and to be general of all the force 
the Spaniard have in France they find he still 
as a unmatched Achilles in the war 
so a most wise Ulysses to their word 
stop his ear at their enchant sound 
and plain he tell they that although his blood 
be move by nature be a very fire 
and boil in apprehension of a wrong 
yet shall his mind hold such a sceptre there 
as will contain it from all act and thought 
of treachery or ingratitude to his prince 
yet do I long methinks to see la fin 
who have his heart in keep since his state 
grow to decay and he to discontent 
come near the ambitious plight of duke Byron 
my lord Vidame when do your lordship think 
your uncle of la fin will be arrive 

I think my lord he now be near arrive 
for his particular journey and devotion 
vow to the holy lady of Loretto 
be long since past and he upon return 

in he as in a crystal that be charm 
I shall discern by who and what design 
my rule be threaten and that sacred power 
that have enable this defensive arm 
when I enjoy but in a unequal nook 
of that I now possess to front a king 
far my superior and from twelve set battle 
march home a victor ten of they obtain 
without my personal service will not see 
a traitorous subject foil i and so end 
what his hand have with such success begin 

see the young dauphin bring to cheer your highness 

my royal blessing and the king of heaven 
make thou a age and a happy king 
help nurse to put my sword into his hand 
hold boy by this and with it may thy arm 
cut from thy tree of rule all traitorous branch 
that strive to shadow and eclipse thy glory 
have thy old father angel for thy guide 
redouble be his spirit in thy breast 
who when this state run like a turbulent sea 
in civil hate and bloody enmity 
their wrath and envy like so many wind 
settle and burst and like the halcyon birth 
be thou to bring a calm upon the shore 
in which the eye of war may ever sleep 
as overmatch with former massacre 
when guilty make noblesse feed on noblesse 
all the sweet plenty of the realm exhaust 
when the naked merchant be pursue for spoil 
when the poor peasant fright needy thief 
with their pale leanness nothing leave on they 
but meager carcase sustain with air 
wander like ghost affright from their grave 
when with the often and incessant sound 
the very beast know the alarm bell 
and hear it run bellow to their home 
from which unchristian broil and homicide 
let the religious sword of justice free 
thou and thy kingdom govern after i 
o heaven or if the unsettle blood of France 
with ease and wealth renew he civil fury 
let all my power be empty in my son 
to curb and end they all as I have do 
let he by virtue quite out of from fortune 
her feather shoulder and her wing shoe 
and thrust from her light foot her turn stone 
that she may ever tarry by his throne 
and of his worth let after age say 
he fight for the land and bring home 
just conquest load with his enemy spoil 
his father past all France in martial deed 
but he his father twenty time exceed 

my dear friend D'Auvergne and Laffin 
we need no conjuration to conceal 
our close intendment to advance our state 
even with our merit which be now neclect 
since Britain be reduce and breathless war 
have sheathe his sword and wrap his ensign up 
the king have now no more use of my valour 
and therefore I shall now no more enjoy 
the credit that my service hold with he 
my service that have drive through all extreme 
through tempest drought and through the deep flood 
winter of shot and over rock so high 
that bird can scarce aspire their ridgy top 
the world be quite invert virtue throw 
at vice foot and sensual peace confound 
valour and cowardice fame and infamy 
the rude and terrible age be turn again 
when the thick air hide heaven and all the star 
be drown in humour tough and hard to pierce 
when the red sun hold not his fix place 
keep not his certain course his rise and set 
nor yet distinguish with his definite bound 
nor in his firm conversion be discern 
the fruitful distance of time and place 
in the well vary season of the year 
when the incomposd incursion of flood 
waste and eat the earth and all thing show 
wild and disorder nought be worse than now 
we must reform and have a new creation 
of state and government and on our chaos 
will I sit brood up another world 
i who through all the danger that can siege 
the life of man have force my glorious way 
to the repair of my country ruin 
will ruin it again to readvance it 
roman Camillus save the state of Rome 
with far less merit than Byron have France 
and how short of this be my recompense 
the king shall know I will have better price 
set on my service in spite of who 
I will proclaim and ring my discontent 
into the far ear of all the world 

how great a spirit he breathe how learn how wise 
but worthy prince you must give temperate air 
to your unmatched and more than human wind 
else will our plot be frostbit in the flower 

betwixt ourselves we may give liberal vent 
to all our fiery and displease impression 
which nature can not entertain with life 
without some exhalation a wrong thought 
will break a rib of steel 

my princely friend 
enough of these eruption our grave councillor 
well know that great affair will not be forge 
but upon anvil that be line with wool 
we must ascend to our intention top 
like cloud that be not see till they be up 

o you do too much ravish and my soul 
offer to music in your numerous breath 
sententious and so high it wake death 
it be for these part that the spanish king 
have swear to win they to his side 
at any price or peril that great Savoy 
offer his princely daughter and a dowry 
amount to five hundred thousand crown 
with full transport of all the sovereign right 
belong to the state of Burgundy 
which marriage will be make the only cement 
to effect and strengthen all our secret treaty 
instruct i therefore my assure prince 
now I be go to resolve the king 
of his suspicion how I shall behave i 

go my most trust friend with happy foot 
make i a sound man with he go to court 
but with a little train and be prepare 
to hear at first term of contempt and choler 
which you may easy calm and turn to grace 
if you beseech his highness to believe 
that your whole drift and course for Italy 
where he have hear you be be only make 
out of your longwellknown devotion 
to our right holy lady of Loretto 
as you have tell some of your friend in court 
and that in pass Milan and Thurin 
they charge you to propound my marriage 
with the three daughter of the duke of Savoy 
which you have do and I reject it 
resolve to build upon his royal care 
for my bestow which he late vow 

o you direct as if the god of light 
sit in each nook of you and point out 
the path of empire charm all the danger 
on both side arm with his harmonious finger 

beside let i entreat you to dismiss 
all that have make the voyage with your lordship 
but special the curate and to lock 
your paper in some place of doubtless safety 
or sacrifice they to the god of fire 
consider worthy that in your hand 
I put my fortune honour and my life 

therein the bounty that your grace have show i 
I prize past life and all thing that be i 
and will undoubted preserve and tender 
the merit of it as my hope of heaven 

I make no question farewell worthy friend Exit 

be these proof of that pure catholic zeal 
that make he wish no other glorious title 
then to be call the scourge of Huguenot 

no question sir he be of no religion 
but upon false ground by some courtier lay 
have oft be hear to mock and jest at all 

be not his treason heinous 

Most abhor 

all be confirm that you have hear before 
and amplify with many horror more 

good De'laffin you be our golden plummet 
to sound this gulf of all ingratitude 
in which you have with excellent desert 
of loyalty and policy express 
your name in action and with such appearance 
have prove the part of his ingrateful treason 
that I must credit more than I desire 

I must confess my lord my voyage 
make to the duke of Savoy and to Milan 
be with endeavour that the war return 
may breed some trouble to your majesty 
and profit those by who they be procure 
but since in their design your sacred person 
be not except which I since have see 
it so abhor i that I be resolve 
to give you full intelligence thereof 
and rather choose to fail in promise 
make to the servant then infringe my fealty 
swear to my royal sovereign and master 

I be extreme discontent to see 
this most unnatural conspiracy 
and will not have the marshal of Byron 
the first example or my force justice 
nor that his death shall be the worthy cause 
that my calm reign which hitherto have hold 
a clear and cheerful sky above the head 
of my dear subject shall so sudden 
be overcast with cloud of fire and thunder 
yet on submission I vow still his pardon 

and still our humble counsel for his service 
will so resolve you if he will employ 
his honour valour as effectual 
to fortify the state against your foe 
as he have practise bad intendment with they 

that vow shall stand and we will now address 
some messenger to call he home to court 
without the slender intimation 
of any ill we know we will restrain 
withal forgiveness if he will confess 
his headlong course to ruin and his taste 
from the sweet poison of his friendlike foe 
treason have blister heel dishonest thing 
have bitter river though delicious spring 
Descure haste you unto he and inform 
that have hear by sure intelligence 
of the great levy make in Italy 
of arm and soldier I be resolute 
upon my frontier to maintain a army 
the charge whereof I will impose on he 
and to that end express have command 
de Vic our lord ambassador in Suisse 
to demand levy of six thousand man 
appoint they to march where duke Byron 
shall have direction wherein I have follow 
the counsel of my constable his gossip 
who like advice I make he he know by letter 
wish to hear his own from his own mouth 
and by all mean conjure his speedy presence 
do this with utmost haste 

I will my lord Exit Desc 

my good lord chancellor of many piece 
more than be here of his conspiracy 
present to we by our friend Laffin 
you only shall reserve these seven and twenty 
which be not those that must conclude against he 
but mention only he since I be loath 
to have the rest of the conspirator know 

my lord my purpose be to guard all these 
so safe from the sight of any other 
that in my doublet I will have they sow 
without discover they to my own eye 
till need or opportunity require 

you shall do well my lord they be of weight 
but I be doubtful that his conscience 
will make he so suspicious of the worst 
that he will hardly be induce to come 

I much shall doubt that to but that I hope 
the strength of his conspiracy as yet 
be not so ready that he dare presume 
by his refusal to make know so much 
of his disloyalty 

I yet conceive 
his practise be turn to no bad end 
and good Laffin I pray you wright to he 
to hasten his repair and make he sure 
that you have satisfy i to the full 
for all his action and have utter nought 
but what may serve to banish bad impression 

I will not fail my lord 

convey your letter 
by some choice friend of his or by his brother 
and for a three excitement to his presence 
janin yourself shall go and with the power 
that both the rest employ to make he come

with soft protection of her silver hand 
sometime she tie my leg in her rich hair 
and make i past my nature liberty 
proud of my fetter as I pert sit 
on the white pillow of her naked breast 
I sing for joy she answer note for note 
relish for relish with such ease and art 
in her divine division that my tune 
show like the god of shepherd to the sun 
compare with she ashamed of which disgrace 
I take my true shape bow and all my shaft 
and light all my torch at her eye 
which set about she in a golden ring 
I follow bird again from tree to tree 
kill and present and she kind take 
but when she handle my triumphant bow 
and see the beauty of my golden shaft 
she beg they of i ay poor boy reply

and as for your dear love their discord grow 
so for your love they do their love renew 
and now to prove they capable of your court 
in skill of such conceit and quality 
as here be practise they will first submit 
their grace in dance to your highness doom 
and pray the press to give their measure room

here be a riddle which if any knight 
at first fight can resolve he shall enjoy 
this jewel here annex which though it show 
to vulgar eye no rich than a pebble 
and that no lapidary nor great man 
will give a sou for it it be worth a kingdom 
for it be a artificial stone compose 
by their great mistress virtue and will make 
he that shall wear it live with any little 
suffice and more content than any king 
if he that undertake can resolve it 
and that these nymph can have no harbour here 
it be consider that so many virtue 
can never live in court he shall resolve

to entertain our trusty friend Byron exeunt 

dear friend we must not be more true to king 
than king be to their subject there be school 
now break open in all part of the world 
first found in ingenious Italy 
where some conclusion of estate be hold 
that for a day preserve a prince and ever 
destroy he after from thence man be teach 
to glide into degree of height by craft 
and then lock in themselves by villainy 
but God who know king be not make by art 
but right of nature nor by treachery prop 
but simple virtue once let fall from heaven 
a branch of that green tree who root be yet 
fast fix above the star which sacred branch 
we well may liken to that laurel spray 
that from the heavenly eagle golden sere 
fall in the lap of great Augustus wife 
which spray once set grow up into a tree 
whereof be garland make and emperor 
have their estate and forehead crown with they 
and as the arm of that tree do decay 
the race of great Augustus wear away 
Nero be last of that imperial line 
the tree and emperor together die 
religion be a branch first set and bless 
by heaven high finger in the heart of king 
which whilom grow into a goodly tree 
bright angel sit and sing upon the twig 
and royal branch for the head of king 
be twist of they but since squinteyed envy 
and pale suspicion dash the head of kingdom 
one against another two abhor twin 
with two foul tail stern war and liberty 
enter the world the tree that grow from heaven 
be overrun with moss the cheerful music 
that heretofore have sound out of it 
begin to cease and as she cast her leaf 
by small degree the kingdom of the earth 
decline and wither and look whensoever 
that the pure sap in she be dry up quite 
the lamp of all authority go out 
and all the blaze of prince be extinct 
thus as the poet send a messenger 
out to the stage to show the sum of all 
that follow after so be king revolt 
and play both way with religion 
forerunner of affliction imminent 
which like a chorus subject must lament 

my lord I stand not on these deep discourse 
to settle my course to your fortune i 
be free and inseparable link 
and to your love my life 

thank princely friend 
and whatsoever good shall come of i

my lord here be D'escuris send from the king 
desire access to you 

attend he in 

health to my lord the duke 

Welcome D'escuris 
in what health rest our royal sovereign 

in good health of his body but his mind 
be something trouble with the gather storm 
of foreign power that as he be inform 
address themselves into his frontier town 
and therefore his intent be to maintain 
the body of a army on those part 
and yield their worthy conduct to your valour 

from whence hear he that any storm be rise 

from Italy and his intelligence 
no doubt be certain that in all those part 
levy be hot make for which respect 
he send to his ambassador de Vic 
to make demand in Switzerland for the raise 
with utmost diligence of six thousand man 
all which shall be command to attend 
on your direction as the constable 
your honour gossip give he in advice 
and he send you by wright of which letter 
he will have answer and advice from you 
by your most speedy presence 

this be strange 
that when the enemy be to attempt his frontier 
he call i from the frontier do he think 
it be a action worthy of my valour 
to turn my back to a approach foe 

the foe be not so near but you may come 
and take more strict direction from his highness 
than he think fit his letter shall contain 
without the least attainture of your valour 
and therefore good my lord forbear excuse 
and bear yourself on his direction 
who well you know have never make design 
for your most worthy service where he see 
that any thing but honour can succeed 

I will not come I swear 

I know your grace 
will send no such unsavoury reply 

tell he that I beseech his majesty 
to pardon my repair till the end be know 
of all these levy now in Italy 

my lord I know that tale will never please he 
and wish you as you love his love and pleasure 
to satisfy his summons speedy 
and speedy I know he will return you 

by heaven it be not fit if all my service 
make i know any thing beseech he therefore 
to trust my judgement in these doubtful charge 
since in assure assault it have not fail he 

I will your lordship now will trust his judgement 

God precious you be importunate past measure 
and I know further than your charge extend 
I will satisfy his highness let that serve 
for by this flesh and blood you shall not bear 
any reply to he but this from i 

it be nought to i my lord I wish your good 
and for that cause have be importunate Exit desc 

by no mean go my lord but with distrust 
of all that have be say or can be send 
collect your friend and stand upon your guard 
the king fair letter and his message 
be only golden pill and comprehend 
horrible purgative 

I will not go 
for now I see the instruction late send i 
that something be discover be too true 
and my head rule none of those neighbour noble 
that every pursuant bring beneath the axe 
if they bring i out they shall see I will hatch 
like to the blackthorn that put forth his leaf 
not with the golden fawn of the sun 
but sharp shower of hail and black frost 
blow battery breach shower of steel and blood 
must be his downright messenger for i 
and not the misling breath of policy 
he he himself make passage to his crown 
through no more army battle massacre 
than I will ask he to arrive at i 
he take on he my execution 
and on the demolition that this arm 
have shake out of fort and citadel 
have he advance the trophy of his valour 
where I in those assumption may scorn 
and speak contemptuous of all the world 
for any equal yet I ever find 
and in my rise not the syrian star 
that in the lion mouth undaunted shine 
and make his brave ascension with the sun 
be of the egyptian with more zeal behold 
and make a rule to know the circuit 
and compass of the year then I be hold 
when I appear from battle the whole sphere 
and full sustainer of the state we bear 
I have alcideslike go under the earth 
and on these shoulder bear the weight of France 
and for the fortune of the thankless king 
my father all know set he in his throne 
and if he urge i I may pluck he out enter Mess 

here be the precedent janin my lord 
send from the king and urge quick access 

another pursuivant and one so quick 
he take next course with i to make he stay 
but let he in let we here what he importune enter janin 

honour and loyal hope to duke Byron 

no other touch i say how fare the king 

farely my lord the cloud be yet far off 
that aim at his obscure and his will 
will glad give the motion to your power 
that shall disperse it but the mean himself 
will personal relate in your direction 

still on that haunt 

upon my life my lord 
he much desire to see you and your sight 
be now grow necessary to suppress 
as with the glorious splendour of the sun 
the rude wind that report breath in his ear 
endeavour to blast your loyalty 

sir if my loyalty stick in he no fast 
but that the light breath of report may lose it 
so I rest still unmoved let he be shake 

but these aloof abode my lord bewray 
that there be rather firmness in your breath 
then in your heart truth be not make of glass 
that with a small touch it shall fear to break 
and therefore shall not shun it believe i 
his arm be long and strong and it can fetch 
any within his will that will not come 
not he that surfeit in his mine of gold 
and for the pride thereof compare with God 
call with almost nothing different 
his power invincible for omnipotent 
can back your bold fort against his assault 
it be his pride and vain ambition 
that have but two stair in his high design 
the low envy and the high blood 
that do abuse you and give mind too high 
rather a will by giddiness to fall 
than to descend by judgement 

I rely 
on no man back nor belly but the king 
must think that merit by ingratitude crack 
require a firm cement than word 
and he shall find it a much hard work 
to solder break heart than shiver glass 

my lord it be better hold a sovereign love 
by bear injury then by lay out 
stir his displeasure prince discontent 
be once incense be like the flame of Aetna 
not to be quench nor lessen and be sure 
a subject confidence in any merit 
against his sovereign that make he presume 
to fly too high approve he like a cloud 
that make a show as it do hawk at kingdom 
and can command all raise beneath his vapour 
when sudden the fowl that hulk so fair 
stoop in a puddle or consume in air 

I fly with no such aim nor be oppose 
against my sovereign but the worthy height 
I have wrought by my service I will hold 
which if I come away I can do 
for if the enemy shall invade the frontier 
who charge to guard be i with any spoil 
although the king in place of another 
may well excuse i yet all foreign king 
that can take note of no such secret quittance 
will lay the weakness here upon my want 
and therefore my abode be resolute 

I sorrow for your resolution 
and fear your dissolution will succeed 

I must endure it 

fare you well my lord 

farewell to you enter Brun 
captain what other news 

la fin salute you 

welcome good friend I hope your wish arrival 
will give some certain end to our design 

I know not that my lord report be raise so doubtful and so different that the truth of any one can hardly be assure 

good news D'Auvergne our trusty friend la fin 
have clear all scruple with his majesty 
and utter nothing but what serve to clear 
all bad suggestion 

so he say my lord 
but other say la Fin assurance 
be mere deceit and wish you to believe 
that when the Vidame nephew to la fin 
meet you at autumn to assure your doubt 
his uncle have say nothing to the king 
that may offend you all the journey charge 
the king defray beside your true friend 
will i to make you certain that your place 
of government be otherwise dispose 
and all advice you for your late hope 
to make retreat into the french county 

I thank they all but they touch not the depth 
of the affair betwixt la fin and i 
who be return content to his house 
quite free of all displeasure or distrust 
and therefore worthy friend we will now to court 

my lord I like your other friend advice 
much better than Laffin and on my life 
you can not come to court with any safety 

who shall infringe it I know all the court 
have better apprehension of my valour 
then that they dare lay violent hand on i 
if I have only mean to draw this sword 
I shall have power enough to set i free 
from seizure by my proud enemy Exit 

he will not come I dare engage my hand 

he will be fetch then I will engage my head 

Come or be fetch he quite have lose his honour 
in give these suspicion of revolt 
from his allegiance that which he have win 
with sundry wound and peril of his life 
with wonder of his wisdom and his valour 
he lose with a most enchant glory 
and admiration of his pride and folly 

why do you never see a fortunate man 
sudden raise to heap of wealth and honour 
nor any rare great in gift of nature 
as valour wit and smooth use of the tongue 
set strange to the pitch of popular like 
but with as sudden fall the rich and honour 
be overwhelm by poverty and shame 
or have no use of both above the wretched 

Men never be satisfy with that they have 
but as a man match with a lovely wife 
when his most heavenly theory of her beauty 
be dull and quite exhaust with his practice 
he bring she forth to feast where he ahlas 
fall to his viand with no thought like other 
that think he bless in she and they poor man 
court and make face offer service sweat 
with their desire contention break their brain 
for jest and tale sit mute and lose their look 
far out of wit and out of countenance 
so all man else do what they have transplant 
and place their wealth in thirst of that they want 

he will not come I must both grieve and wonder 
that all my care to win my subject love 
and in one cup of friendship to comix 
our life and fortune shall leave out so many 
as give a man contemptuous of my love 
and of his own good in the kingdom peace 
hope in a continuance so ungrateful 
to bear out his design in spite of i 
how shall I better please all than I do 
when they suppose I will have give some 
insolent garrison other citadel 
and to all sort increase of misery 
province by province I do visit all 
who those injurious rumour have dissuade 
and show they how I never seek to build 
more fort for i then be within their heart 
nor use more stern constraint then their good will 
to succour the necessity of my crown 
that I desire to add to their content 
by all occasion rather than subtract 
nor wish I that my treasury shall flow 
with gold that swim in in my subject tear 
and than I find no man that do not bless 
my few year reign and their triumphant peace 
and do they now so soon complain of ease 

he will not come enter Byron de Avnergne brother with other 

o madness he be come 

the duke be come my lord 

o sir you be welcome 
and fit to conduct i to my house 

I must beseech your majesty excuse 
that jealous of my honour I have use 
some of my own commandment in my stay 
and come not with your highness soon summon 

the faithful servant right in holy writ 
that say he will not come and yet he come 
but come you hither I must tell you now 
not the contempt you stand to in your stay 
but the bad ground that bear up your contempt 
make you arrive at no port but repentance 
despair and ruin 

be what port it will 
at which your will will make i be arrive 
I be not come to justify myself 
to ask you pardon nor accuse my friend 

if you conceal my enemy you be one 
and then my pardon shall be worth your ask 
or else your head be worth my cut of 

be friend and worthy fautor of myself 
I be no foe of you nor no impairer 
since he can no way worthy maintain 
his prince honour that neglect his own 
and if your will have be to my true reason 
maintain still the truth of loyalty 
a check to my free nature and my honour 
and that on your free justice I presume 
to cross your will a little I conceive 
you will not think this forfeit worth my head 

have you maintain your truth of loyalty 
when since I pardon foul intention 
resolve to forget eternal what they appear in 
and have welcome you as the kind father do his riotous son 
I can approve fact foul than the intent 
of deep disloyalty and high treason 

may this right hand be thunder to my breast 
if I stand guilty of the slender fact 
wherein the left of those two can be prove 
for can my tender conscience but have touch 
at any such unnatural relapse 
I will not with this confidence have run 
thus headlong in the furnace of a wrath 
blow and thrice kindle have way enough 
in my election both to shun and sleight it 

you be gross and vain glorious abuse 
there be no way in Savoy nor in Spain 
to give a fool that hope of your escape 
and have you not even when you do arrive 
with horror to the proud hope you have 
I will have fetch you 

you must then have use 
a power beyond my knowledge and a will 
beyond your justice for a little stay 
more than I use will hardly have be worthy 
of such a open expedition 
in which to all the censure of the world 
my faith and innocence have be foul foil 
which I protest by heaven bright witness 
that shine far far from mixture with our fear 
retain as perfect roundness as their sphere 

it be well my lord I think I can have fright 
your firm confidence some other time 
we will as now in private sift your action 
and pour more than you think into the side 
always reserve clemency and pardon 
upon confession be you never so foul 
come let we clear up our brow shall we to tennis 

I my lord if I may make the match 
the duke Espernon and myself will play 
with you and count Soisson 

I know my lord 
you play well but you make your match ill 

Come it be a match Exit 

how like you my arrival 

I will tell you as your friend in your ear 
you have give more preferment to your courage 
then to the provident counsel of your friend 

I tell he so my lord and much be grieve 
to see his bold approach so full of will 

well I must bear it now though but with the head 
the shoulder bear nothing 

by saint john 
it be a good headless resolution exeunt 

o the most base fruit of a settle peace 
in man I mean worse than their dirty field 
which they manure much better themselves 
for they they plant and sow and ere they grow 
weedy and choke with thorn they grub and prune 
and make they better than when cruel war 
fright from thence the sweaty labourer 
but man themselves instead of bear fruit 
grow rude and foggy overgrow with weed 
their spirit and freedom smother in their ease 
and as their tyrant and their minister 
grow wild in prosecution of their lust 
so they grow prostitute and lie like whore 
down and take up to their abhor dishonour 
the friendless may be injure and oppress 
the guiltless lead to slaughter the deserver 
give to the beggar right be whole wrong 
and wrong be only honour till the string 
of every man heart crack and who will stir 
to tell authority that it do err 
all man cling to it though they see their blood 
in their most dear associate and ally 
pour into kennel by it and who dare 
but look well in the breast who that impair 
how all the court now look askew on i 
go by without salute shun my sight 
which like a march sun ague breed in they 
from whence of late it be health to have a beam 

now none will speak to we we thrust ourselves 
into man company and offer speech 
as if not make for their divert ear 
their back turn to we and their word to other 
and we must like obsequious parasite 
follow their face wind about their person 
for look and answer or be cast behind 
no more view than the wallet of their fault 

yet here be one view i and I think will speak 

my lord if you respect your name and race 
the preservation of your former honour 
merit and virtue humble cast they all 
at the king mercy for beyond all doubt 
your act have thither drive they he have proof 
so pregnant and so horrid that to hear they 
will make your valour in your very look 
give up your force miserable guilty 
but he be most loath for his ancient love 
to your rare virtue and in their impair 
the full discouragement of all that live 
to trust or favour any gift in nature 
to expose they to the light when darkness may 
cover she own brood and keep still in day 
nothing of you but that may brook her brightness 
you know what horror these high stroke do bring 
raise in the arm of a incense king 

my lord be sure the king can complain 
of any thing in i but my true service 
which in so many danger of my death 
may so approve my spotless loyalty 
that those quite opposite horror you assure 
must look out of his own ingratitude 
or the malignant envy of my foe 
who pour i out in such a stygian flood 
to drown i in myself since their desert 
be far from such a deluge and in i 
hide like so many river in the sea 

you think I come to found you fare you well exit 

see see not one of they will cast a glance 
at our eclipse face 

they keep all to cast in admiration on the king 
for from his face be all their face mould 

but when a change come we shall see they all 
change into water that will instant 
give look for look as if it watch to greet we 
or else for one they will give we twenty face 
like to the little speck on side of glass 

be it not a easy loss to lose their look 
who heart so soon be melt 

but methinks 
be courtier they shall cast best look on man 
when they think worst of they 

o no my lord 
they never dissemble but for some advantage 
they sell their look and shadow which they rate 
after their market keep beneath the state 
lord what foul weather their aspect do threaten 
see in how grave a brake he set his vizard 
passion of nothing see a excellent gesture 
now courtship go a ditch in their forehead 
and we be fall into those dismal ditch 
why even thus dreadful will they be rapt 
if the king butter egg be only spill 

lord chancellor 

I my lord 

and lord Vidame exit 

and not Byron here be a prodigious change 

he cast no beam on you 

why now you see 
from whence their countenance be copy 

see here come some news I believe my lord 

what say the honest captain of my guard 

I bring a letter from a friend of you 

it be welcome then 

have we yet any friend 

more than you will I think I never see 
man in their right mind so unrighteous 
in their own cause 

see what thou have bring 
he will we to retire ourselves my lord 
and make as if it be almost too late 
what say my captain shall we go or no 

I will your dagger point have kiss my heart 
when you resolve to come 

I pray the why 

yet do that senseless apoplexy dull you 
the devil or your wicked angel blind you 
bereave all your reason of a man 
and leave you but the spirit of a horse 
in your brute nostril only power to dare 

why do thou think my come here have bring i 
to such a unrecoverable danger 

judge by the strange ostent that have succeed 
since your arrival the kind fowl the wild duck 
that come into your cabinet so beyond 
the sight of all your servant or yourself 
that fly about and on your shoulder sit 
and which you have so feed and so attend 
for that dumb love she show you just as soon 
as you be part on the sudden die 
and to make this no less than a ostent 
another that have fortune since confirm it 
your goodly horse Pastrana which the archduke 
give you at Brussels in the very hour 
you leave your strength felmad and kill himself 
●●e like chance to the horse the great duke send you 
and with both these the horse the duke of Lorraine 
send you at Vinsie make a three presage 
of some inevitable fate that touch you 
who like the other pine away and die 

all these together be indeed oftentful 
which by another like I can confirm 
the matchless earl of Essex who some make 
in their most sure divine of my death 
a parallel with i in life and fortune 
have one horse likewise that the very hour 
he suffer death be well the night before 
die in his pasture noble happy beast 
that die not have to their will to live 
they use no deprecation nor complaint 
nor suit for mercy among they the lion 
serve not the lion nor the horse the horse 
as man serve man when man show most their spirit 
in valour and their utmost dare to do 
they be compare to lion wolf and boar 
but by conversion none will say a lion 
fight as he have the spirit of a man 
let i then in my danger now give cause 
for all man to begin that simile 
for all my huge engagement I provide i 
this short sword only which if I have time 
to show my apprehendor he shall use 
power of ten lion if I get not lose 

what shall we do with this unthankful man 
will he of one thing but reveal the truth 
which I have proof of underneath his hand 
he shall not taste my justice I will give 
two hundred thousand crown that he will yield 
but such mean for my pardon as he shall 
I never love man like he will have trust 
my son in his protection and my realm 
he have deserve my love with worthy service 
yet can he not deny but I have thrice 
save he from death I draw he of the foe 
at fountain Francoise where he be engage 
so wound and so much amaze with blow 
that as I play the soldier in his rescue 
I be enforce to play the Marshal 
to order the retreat because he say 
he be not fit to do it nor to serve i 

your majesty have use your utmost mean 
both by your own persuasion and his friend 
to bring he to submission and confess 
with some sign of repentance his foul fault 
yet still he stand prefract and insolent 
you have in love and care of his recovery 
be half in labour to produce a course 
and resolution what be fit for he 
and since so ample it concern your crown 
you must by law cut of what by your grace 
you can bring into the state of safety 

begin at the end my lord and execute 
like Alexander with Parmenio 
prince you know be master of their law 
and may resolve they to what form they please 
so all conclude in justice in who stroke 
there be one sort of manage for the great 
another for inferior the great mother 
of all production grave necessity 
command the variation and the profit 
so certain foresee commend the example 

I like not execution so informal 
for which my predecessor have be blame 
my subject and the world shall know my power 
and my authority by law usual course 
dare punish not the devilish head of treason 
but there confederate be they never so dreadful 
the decent ceremony of my law 
and their solemnity shall be observe 
with all their sternness and severity 

where will your highness have he apprehend 

not in the castle as some have advise 
but in his chamber 

Rather in your own 
or come out of it for it be assure 
that any other place of apprehension 
will make the hard performance end in blood 

to shun this likelihood my lord it be best 
to make the apprehension near your chamber 
for all respect and reverence give the place 
more than be needful to chastise the person 
and save the open of to many vein 
be vain and dangerous 

gather you your guard 
and I will find fit time to give the word 
when you shall seize on he and on D'Auvergne 

we will be ready to the death my lord exeunt 

o thou that govern the keen sword of king 
direct my arm in this important stroke 
or hold it be advance the weight of blood 
even in the base subject do exact 
deep consultation in the high king 
for in one subject death unjust affright 
passion and pain though he be never so poor 
ask more remorse than the voluptuous spleen 
of all king in the world deserve respect 
he shall be bear greyheaded that will bear 
the sword of empire judgement of the life 
free state and reputation of a man 
if it be just and worthy dwell so dark 
that it deny access to sun and moon 
the soul eye sharpen with that sacred light 
of who the sun itself be but a beam 
must only give that judgement oh how much 
err those king then that play with life and death 
and nothing put into their serious state 
but humour and their lust for which alone 
man long for kingdom who huge counterpoise 
in care and danger can a fool comprise 
he will not be a king but will be wise 

here come the man with who ambitious head 
cast in the way of treason we must stay 
his full chase of our ruin and our realm 
this hour shall take upon her shady wing 
his late liberty and life to hell 

we be undo 

what be that 

I hear he not 

madam you be honour much that duke Byron 
be so observant some to card with he 
you four as now you come sit to primero 
and I will fight a battle at the chess 

a good safe fight believe i other war 
thirst blood and wound and his thirst quench be thankless 

lift and then cut 

it be right the end of lift 
when man be lift to their high pitch 
they cut of those that lift they so high 

Apply you all these sport so serious 

they first be from our serious act devise 
the best of which be to the best but sport 
I mean by best the great for their end 
in man that serve they best be their own pleasure 

So in those best man service their end 
be their own pleasure pass 

I vy't 

I see it 
and wonder at his frontless impudence exit Hen 

how speed your majesty 

well the duke instruct i 
with such grave lesson of mortality 
force out of our light sport that if I lose 
I can but speed well 

some idle talk 
for courtship sake you know do not amiss 

will we may hear some of it 

that you shall 
I cast away a card now make i think 
of the decease worthy king of Spain 

what card be that 

the king of heart my lord 
who name yield well the memory of that king 
who be indeed the worthy king of heart 
and have both of his subject heart and stranger 
much more than all the king of Christendom 

he win they with his gold 

he win they chief 
with his so general piety and justice 
and as the little yet great Macedon 
be say with his humane philosophy 
to teach the rapeful hyrcan marriage 
and bring the barbarous sogdians to nourish 
not kill their age parent as before 
the incestuous persian to reverence 
their mother not to use they as their wife 
the Indian to adore the grecian god 
the scythian to inter not eat their parent 
so he with his divine philosophy 
which I may call his since he chief use it 
in Turkey India and through all the world 
expel profane idolatry and from earth 
raise temple to the high who with the word 
he can not win he just put to sword 

he seek for gold and empire 

it be religion 
and her full propagation that he seek 
if gold have be his end it have be hoard 
when he have fetch it in so many fleet 
which he spend not on median luxury 
banquet and woman calidonian wine 
nor dear hyrcanian fish but employ it 
to propagate his empire and his empire 
desire to extend so that he may withal 
extend religion through it and all nation 
reduce to one firm constitution 
of piety justice and one public weal 
to which end he make all his matchless subject 
make tent their castle and their garrison 
true catholic countryman and their ally 
heretic stranger and their enemy 
there be in he the magnanimity 

to temper your extreme applause my lord 
shorten and answer all thing in a word 
the great commendation we can give 
to the remembrance of that king decease 
be that he spare not his own elder son 
but put he just to a violent death 
because he seek to trouble his estate 

be it so 

that bit my lord upon my life

betwixt his will and duty be dissolve 
for then I know he will submit himself 
think you it not as strong a point of faith 
to rectify your loyalty to i 
as to be trusty in each other wrong

my lord if I can utter any thought 
instruct with disloyalty to you 
and may light any safety to my friend 
though my own heart come after it shall out

And fix you all in such a flourish peace

Come you be a atheist Byron and a traitor

as thy corrupt soul thou end the war 
and settle peace in France what war have rage 
into who fury I have not expose 
my person which be as free a spirit as thou

and arm in all the merit of your valour 
your body thrust amid the thick fight 
never be bristle with so many battle 
nor on the foe have break such wood of lance 
as grow upon my thigh and I have marshal 
I be ashamed to brag thus where envy 
and arrogance their opposite bulwark raise 
man be allow to use their proper praise 
away with he exit Henry 

away with he live I 
and here my life thus slight curse man 
that ever the intelligence light 
betray i to man whorish fellowship 
to prince moorish slavery to be make

a property for a tyrant to set up 
and puff down with the vapour of his breath 
will you not kill i 

no we will not hurt you 
we be command only to conduct you 
into your lodging 

to my lodging where 

within the cabinet of arm my lord 

what to a prison death I will not go 

we will force you then 

and take away my sword 
a proper point of force you have as good

partial and bloody oh that in my eye 
be all the sorcerous poison of my woe 
that I may witch you headlong from your height 
and trample on it your execrable light 

Come will you go my lord this rage be vain 

and so be all your grave authority 
and that all France shall feel before I die 
you see all how they use good catholic 

farewell for ever so have I deserve 
a exhalation that will be a star 
fall when the sun forsake it in a sink 
shoe ever overthrow that be too large 
and huge canon burst with overcharge 

my lord I have commandment from the king 
to charge you go with i and ask your sword 

my sword who fear it it be never the death 
of any but wild boar I prithee take it 
have thou advertise this when last we meet 
I have be in my bed and fast asleep 
two hour ago lead I will go where thou will exit 

see how he bear his cross with his small strength 
on easy shoulder than the other Atlas 

strength to aspire be still accompany 
with weakness to endure all popular gift 
be colour it will bear no vinegar 
and rather to adverse affair betray 
thy arm against they his state still his best 
that have most inward worth and that be best try 
that neither glory nor be glorify 

what shall we think my lord of these new force 
that from the king of Spain have pass the Alps 
for which I think his lord ambassador 
be come to court to get their pass for Flanders 

I think my lord they have no end for Flanders 
count Maurice be already enter Brabant 
to pass to Flanders to relieve Ostend 
and the archduke full prepare to hinder he 
and sure it be that they must measure force 
which ere this new force can have pass the Alps 
of force must be encounter 

it be unlikely 
that their march have so large a aim as Flanders 

as these time sort they may have short reach 
that will pierce further 

I have be advertise 
that count Fuentes by who mean this army 
be late levy and who hand be strong 
in thrust on Byron conspiracy 
have cause these cunning force to advance 
with colour only to set down in Flanders 
but have intentional respect to favour 
and countenance his false partisan in Bresse 
and friend in Burgundy to give they heart 
for the full take of their heart from i 
be as it will we shall prevent their worst 
and therefore call in Spain ambassador 
what will the lord ambassador of Spain 

first in my master name I will beseech 
your highness hearty thought that his true hand 
hold in your vow amity have not touch 
at any least point in Byron offence 
nor once have notice of a crime so foul 
whereof since he doubt not you stand resolve 
he pray your league continuance in this favour 
that the army he have raise to march for Flanders 
may have safe passage by your frontier town 
and find the river free that run by rhone 

my lord my frontier shall not be disarm 
till by arraignment of the duke of Byron 
my scruple be resolve and I may know 
in what account to hold your master faith 
for his observance of the league betwixt we 
you wish i to believe that he be clear 
from all the project cause by count Fuentes 
his special agent but where deed pull down 
word may repair no faith I scarce can think 
that his gold be so bounteous employ 
without his special counsel and command 
these faint proceed in our royal faith 
make subject prove so faithless if because 
we sit above the danger of the law 
we likewise lift our arm above their justice 
and that our heavenly sovereign bound not we 
in those religious confine out of which 
our justice and our true law be inform 
in vain have we expectance that our subject 
shall not as well presume to offend their earthly 
as we our heavenly sovereign and this breach 
make in the fort of all society 
of all celestial and humane respect 
make no strength of our bounty counsel arm 
hold out against their treason and the rape 
make of humanity and religion 
in all man more than pagan liberty 
atheism and slavery will derive their spring 
from their base precedent copy out of king 
but all this shall not make i break the commerce 
authorize by our treaty let your army 
take the direct pass it shall go safe 

so rest your highness ever and assure 
that my true sovereign loathe all opposite thought 

be our dispatch make to all the king 
prince and potentate of Christendom 
ambassador and province governor 
to inform the truth of this conspiracy 

they all be make my lord and some give out 
that it be a blow give to religion 
to weaken it in ruine of he 
that say he never wish more glorious title 
then to be call the scourge of Huguenot 

other that be like favourer of the fault 
say it be a politic advice from England 
to break the fear javelin both together 

such shut their eye to truth we can but set 
his light before they and his trumpet sound 
close to their ear their partial wilfulness 
in rest blind and deaf or in pervert 
what their most certain sense apprehend 
shall nought discomfort our impartial justice 
nor clear the desperate fault that do enforce it enter vyt 

the peer of France my lord refuse to appear 
at the arraignment of the duke Byron 

the court may yet proceed and so command it 
it be not their slackness to appear shall serve 
to let my will to appear in any fact 
wherein the bold of they tempt my justice 
I be resolve and will no more endure 
to have my subject make what I command 
the subject of their opposition 
who evermore slack their allegiance 
as king forbear their penance how sustain 
your prisoner their strange durance 

one of they 
which be the count D'Auvergne have merry spirit 
eat well and sleep and never can imagine 
that any place where he be be a prison 
where on the other part the duke Byron 
enter his prison as into his grave 
reject all food sleep not nor once lie down 
fury have arm his thought so thick with thorn 
that rest can have no entry he disdain 
to grace the prison with the slender show 
of any patience least man shall conceive 
he think his sufferance in the best sort fit 
and hold his band so worthless of his worth 
that he impair it to vouchsafe to they 
the best part of the peace that freedom owe it 
that patience therein be a willing slavery 
and like the camel stoop to take the load 
so still he walk or rather as a bird 
enter a closet which unware be make 
his desperate prison be pursue amaze 
and wrathful beat his breast from wall to wall 
assault the light strike down himself not our 
and be take struggle gasp and bite 
take all his taker stroke to be stroke 
abhor food and with a savage will 
fret pine and die for former liberty 
So fare the wrathful duke and when the strength 
of these dumb rage break out into sound 
he breathe defiance to the world and bid we 
make ourselves drink with the remain blood 
of five and thirty wound receive in fight 
for we and we for we shall never brag 
that we have make his spirit check at death 
this rage in walk and word but in his look 
he cement all and print a world of book 

let other learn by he to curb their spleen 
before they be curb and to cease their grudge 
now I be settle in my sun of height 
the circular splendour and full sphere of state 
take all place up from envy as the sun 
at height and passive over the crown of man 
his beam diffuse and downright pour on they 
cast but a little or no shade at all 
so he that be advance above the head 
of all his emulator with high light 
prevent their envy and deprive they quite exeunt 

I wonder at the prisoner so long stay 

I think it may be make a question 
if his impatience will let he come 

yes he be now well stay time and his judgement 
have cast his passion and his fever of 

his fever may be pass but for his passion 
I fear i we shall find it spice to hot 
with his old powder 

he be sure come forth 
the carosse of the marquis of Rhosny 
conduct he along to the arsenal 
close to the riverside and there I see he 
enter a barge cover with tapestry 
in which the king guard wait and receive he 
stand by there clear the place 

the prisoner come 
my lord Laffin forbear your sight a while 
it may incense the prisoner who will know 
by your attendance near we that your hand 
be chief in his discovery which as yet 
I think he do not doubt 

I will forbear 
till your good pleasure call i exit Laf 

when he know 
and see Laffin accuse he to his face 
the court I think will shake with his distemper 

you see my lord it be in the golden chamber 

the golden chamber where the great king 
have think they honour to receive a place 
and I have have it be I come to stand 
in rank and habit here of man arraign 
where I have sit assistant and be honour 
with glorious title of the chief virtuous 
where the king chief solicitor have say 
there be in France no man that ever live 
who part be worth my imitation 
that but my own worth I can imitate none 
and that I make myself inimitable 
to all that can come after who this court 
have see to sit upon the flower de louse 
in recompense of my renown service 
must I be sit on now by petty judge 
these scarlet robe that come to sit and fight 
against my life dismay my valour more 
than all the bloody cassock Spain have bring 
to field against it 

to the bar my lord he salute and stand to the bar 

Read the indictment 

stay I will invert 
for shortness sake the form of our proceed 
and out of all the point the process hold 
collect five principal with which we charge you 

first you confer with one call Picote 
at Orleans bear and into Flanders flee 
to hold intelligence by he with the archduke 
and for two voyage to that effect 
bestow on he five hundred fifty crown 

next you hold treaty with the duke of Savoy 
without the king permission offer he 
all service and assistance against all man 
in hope to have in marriage his three daughter 

third you hold intelligence with the duke 
at take in of Bourge and other fort 
advise he with all your prejudice 
against the king army and his royal person 

the four be that you will have bring the king 
before saint Katherine fort to be there slay 
and to that end write to the governor 
in which you give he note to know his highness 

five you send Laffin to treat with Savoy 
and with the count Fuentes of more plot 
touch the ruin of the king and realm 

all this my lord I answer and deny 
and first for Picote he be my prisoner 
and therefore I may well confer with he 
but that our conference tend to the archduke 
be nothing so I only do employ he 
to captain la fortune for the reduction 
of Seurre to the service of the king 
who use such speedy diligence therein 
that short it be assure his majesty 

next for my treaty with the duke of Savoy 
Roncas his secretary have make 
a motion to i for the duke three daughter 
I tell it to the king who have since 
give i the understanding by la force 
of his dislike I never dream of it 

third for my intelligence with the duke 
advise he against his highness army 
have this be true I have not undertake 
the assault of Bourg against the king opinion 
have assistance but by they about i 
and have win it for he have not be 
put out of such a government so easy 

four for my advice to kill the king 
I will beseech his highness memory 
not to let slip that I alone dissuade 
his view of that fort inform he 
it have good marksman and he can not go 
but in exceed danger which advice 
divert he the rather since I say 
that if he have desire to see the place 
he shall receive from i a plot of it 
offer to take it with five hundred man 
and I myself will go to the assault 

and last for intelligence hold 
with Savoy and Fuentes I confess 
that be deny to keep the citadel 
which with incredible peril I have get 
and see another honour with my spoil 
I grow so desperate that I find my spirit 
enrage to any act and wish myself 
cover with blood 

with who blood 

with my own 
wish to live no long be deny 
with such suspicion of i and set will 
to rack my furious humour into blood 
and for two month space I do speak and wright 
more than I ought but have do ever well 
and therefore your informer have be false 
and with intent to tyrannize suborn 

what if our witness come face to face 
and justify much more than we allege 

they must be hireling then and man corrupt 

what think you of la fin 

I hold la fin 
a honour gentleman my friend and kinsman 

if he then aggravate what we affirm 
with great accusation to your face 
what will you say 

I know it can be 

call in my lord la fin 

be he so near 
And keep so close from i can all the world 
make he a treacher enter la fin 

I suppose my lord 
you have not stand within without the ear 
of what have here be urge against the duke 
if you have hear it and upon your knowledge 
can witness all be true upon your soul 
utter your knowledge 

I have hear my lord 
all that have pass here and upon my soul 
be charge so urgent in such a court 
upon my knowledge I affirm all true 
and so much more as have the prisoner live 
as many as his year will make all forfeit 

o all you virtuous power in earth and heaven 
that have not put on hellish flesh and blood 
from whence these monstrous issue be produce 
that can bear in execrable concord 
and one prodigious subject contrary 
nor as the I will that of the world admire 
be severe from the world can cut yourselves 
from the consent and sacred harmony 
of life yet live of honour yet be honour 
as this extravagant and errant rogue 
from all your fair decorum and just law 
find power to do and like a loathsome wen 
stick to the face of nature and this court 
thicken this air and turn your plaguy rage 
into a shape as dismal as his sin 
and with some equal horror tear he of 
from sight and memory let not such a court 
to who fame all the king of Christendom 
now lay their ear so crack her royal trump 
as to sound through it that here vaunt justice 
be get in such a incest be it justice 
to tempt and witch a man to break the law 
and by that witch condemn he let i draw 
poison into i with this curse air 
if he bewitch i and transform i not 
he bite i by the ear and make i drink 
enchant water let i see a image 
that utter these distinct word thou shall die 
oh wicked king and if the devil give he 
such power upon a image upon i 
how might he tyrannize that by his vow 
and oath so Stygian have my nerve and will 
in more awe than his own what man be he 
that be so high but he will high be 
so roundly sight but he may be find 
to have a blind side which by craft pursue 
confederacy and simple trust treason 
may wrest he past his angel and his reason 

witchcraft can never taint a honest mind 

true gold will any trial stand untouched 

for colour that will stain when they be try 
the cloth itself be ever cast aside 

sometime the very gloss in any thing 
will seem a stain the fault not in the light 
nor in the guilty object but our sight 
my gloss raise from the richness of my stuff 
have too much splendour for the owly eye 
of politic and thankless royalty 
I do deserve too much a pleurisy 
of that blood in i be the cause I die 
virtue in great man must be small and sleight 
for poor star rule where she be exquisite 
it be tyrannous and impious policy 
to put to death by fraud and treachery 
sleight be then royal when it make man live 
and if it urge fault urge to forgive 
he must be guiltless that condemn the guilty 
like thing do nourish like and not destroy they 
mind must be sound that judge affair of weight 
and see hand cut corrosive from your sight 
a lord intelligencer hangmanlike 
thrust he from human fellowship to the desert 
blow he with curse shall your justice call 
treachery her father will you wish she weigh 
my valour with the hiss of such a viper 
what I have do to shun the mortal shame 
of so unjust a opposition 
my envious star can deny i this 
that I may make my judge witness 
and that my wretched fortune have reserve 
for my last comfort you all know my lord 
this body gash with five and thirty wound 
who life and death you have in your award 
hold not a vein that have not open be 
and which I will not open yet again 
for you and you this hand that write the line 
allege against i have enact still 
more good than there it only talk of ill 
I must confess my choler have transfer 
my tender spleen to all intemperate speech 
but reason ever do my deed attend 
in worth of praise and imitation 
have I bear any will to let they lose 
I can have flesh they with bad service 
in England late and in Switzerland 
there be a hundred gentleman by name 
can witness my demeanour in the first 
and in the last ambassage I adjure 
no other testimony than the signior 
de Vio and Sillerie who ample know 
in what sort and with what fidelity 
I bear myself to reconcile and knit 
in one desire so many will disjoin 
and from the king allegiance quite withdraw 
my act ask many man though do by one 
and I be but one I stand for thousand 
and still I hold my worth though not my place 
nor sleight i judge though I be but one 
one man in one sole expedition 
reduce into the imperial power of Rome 
Armenia Pontus and Arabia Syria Albania and Iberia 
conquer the Hyrcanian and to Caucasus 
his arm extend the numidian 
and Africa to the shore meridional 
his power subject and that part of Spain 
which stand from those part that Sertorius rule 
even to the atlantic sea he conquer 
the albanian king he from the kingdom chase 
and at the caspian sea their dwelling place 
of all the earth globe by power and his advice 
the roundeyed ocean see he victor thrice 
and what shall let i but your cruel doom 
to add as much to France as he to Rome 
and to leave justice neither sword nor word 
to use against my life this senate know 
that what with one victorious hand I take 
I give to all your use with another 
with this I take and prop the fall kingdom 
and give it to the king I have keep 
your law of state from fire and you yourselves 
fix in this high tribunal from who height 
the vengeful saturnal of the league 
have hurl you headlong do you then return 
this retribution can the cruel king 
the kingdom law and you all save by i 
destroy their saver what ay i I do 
adverse to this this damn enchanter do 
that take into his will my motion 
and be bankrupt both of wealth and worth 
pursue with quarrel and with suit in law 
fear by the kingdom threaten by the king 
will raise the loathe dunghill of his ruin 
upon the monumental heap of i 
tear with possess whirlwind may he die 
and dog bark at his murderous memory 

my lord our liberal sufferance of your speech 
have make it late and for this session 
we will dismiss you take he back my lord Exit Vit and Byron 

you likewise may depart Exit Laffin 

what rest now 
to be decree against this great prisoner 
a mighty merit and a monstrous crime 
be here concurrent what by witness 
his letter and instruction we have prove 
himself confess and excuse all 
with witchcraft and the only act of thought 
for witchcraft I esteem it a mere strength 
of rage in he conceive against his accuser 
who be examine have deny it all 
suppose it true it make he false but will 
and worthy mind witchcraft can never force 
and for his thought that break not into deed 
time be the cause not will the mind free act 
in treason still be judge as the outward fact 
if his desert have have a wealthy share 
in save of our land from civil fury 
Manlius have so that fast the Capitol 
yet for his after traitorous faction 
they throw he headlong from the place he save 
my definite sentence then do this import 
that we must quench the wildfire with his blood 
in which it be so traitorous inflame 
unless with it we seek to incense the land 
the king can have no refuge for his life 
if his be quit this be it that make 
Lewis the eleventh renounce his countryman 
and call the valiant Scot out of their kingdom 
to use their great virtue and their faith 
than his own subject in his royal guard 
what then conclude your censure 

he must die 

draw then his sentence formal and send he 
and so all treason in his death attend he exeunt 

I joy you have so good a day my lord 

I win it from they all the chancellor 
I answer to his uttermost improvement 
I move my other judge to lament 
my insolent misfortune and to loath 
the pocky soul and statebawd my accuser 
I make reply to all that can be say 
so eloquent and with such a charm 
of grave enforcement that methinks I sit 
like Orpheus cast reign on savage beast 
at the arm end as it be I take my bar 
and set it far above the high tribunal 
where like a cedar on mount Lebanon 
I grow and make my judge show like boxtree 
and boxtree right their wish will have make they 
whence box shall have grow till they have strike 
my head into the budget but ahlas 
I hold their bloody arm with such strong reason 
and by your leave with such a firk of wit 
that I fetch blood upon the chancellor cheek 
methinks I see his countenance as he sit 
and the most lawyerly delivery 
of his set speech shall I play his part enter soiss Espa 

for heaven sake good my lord 

I will i'faith 
behold a wicked man a man debauch 
a man contest with his king a man 
on who my lord we be not to connive 
though we may condole a man 
that laesa maiestate seek a lease 
of plus quam satis a man that vi et armis 
assail the king and will per fas et nefas 
aspire the kingdom here be lawyer learning 

he say not this my lord that I have hear 

This or the like I swear I pen no speech 

then there be good hope of your wish acquittal 

acquittal they have reason be I dead 
I know they can not all supply my place 
be it possible the king shall be so vain 
to think he can shake i with fear of death 
or make i apprehend that he intend it 
think he to make his firm man his cloud 
the cloud observe their aerial nature 
be bear aloft and then to moisture hang 
fall to the earth where be make thick and cold 
they lose both all their heat and levity 
yet then again recover heat and lightness 
again they be advance and by the sun 
make fresh and glorious and since cloud be rapt 
with these uncertainty now up now down 
be I to flit so with his smile or frown 

I wish your comfort and encouragement 
may spring out of your safety but I hear 
the king have reason so against your life 
and make your most friend yield so to his reason 
that your estate be fearful 

yield to his reason 
o how friend reason and their freedom stretch 
when power set his wide tenter to their side 
how like a cure by mere opinion 
it work upon our blood like the ancient god 
be modern king that live past bound themselves 
yet set a measure down to wretched man 
by many sophism they make good deceit 
and since they pass in power surpass in right 
when king will pass the star wink and the sun 
suffer eclipse rude thunder yield to they 
his horrid wing sit smooth as glass engaze 
and lightning stick betwixt heaven and earth amaze 
man faith be shake and the pit of truth 
overflow with darkness in which justice sit 
and keep her vengeance tie to make it fierce 
and when it come the increase horror show 
heaven plague be sure though full of state and slow

as great regard to save as to condemn

treason lay to his true image 
and you my lord shall answer this injustice 
before his judgement seat to which I summon 
in one year and a day your hot appearance

but they that cause my death shall after come 
by the immaculate justice of the high 

well good my lord commend your soul to he 
and to his mercy think of that I pray 

sir I have think of it and every hour 
since my affliction ask on naked knee

beyond all colour and your proper judgement 
no man have know your merit more than I 
and will to God your great misdeed have be 
as much undo as they have be conceal 
the cry of they for justice in desert 
have be so loud and pierce that they deafen 
the ear of mercy and have labour more 
your judge to compress then to enforce they 

we bring you here your sentence will you read it 

for heaven sake shame to use i with such rigor 
I know what it import and will not have 
my ear blow into flame with hear it 
have you be one of they that have condemn i

good sir my father love you so entire 
that if you have be one my soul forgive you 
it be the king most childish that he be

he give grace in the first draught of my fault 
and now restain it grace again I ask 
let he again vouchsafe it send to he

tell i that if the wilful earl of Essex 
have use submission and but ask her mercy 
she will have give it past resumption

to pardon he even as she pray to God 
he will let down a pardon unto she 
he yet be guilty I be innocent 
he still refuse grace I importune it 

This ask in time my lord while he beseech it 
and ere he have make his severity know 
have with much joy to he I know be grant 

no no his bounty then be misery 
to offer when he know it will be refuse 
he tread the vulgar path of all advantage 
and love man for his vice nor for their virtue 
my service will have quicken gratitude 
in his own death have he be true royal 
it will have stir the image of a king 
into perpetual motion to have stand 
near the conspiracy restrain at Nantes 
and in a danger that have then the wolf 
to fly upon his bosom have I only hold 
intelligence with the conspirator 
who stick at no check but my loyalty 
nor keep life in their hope but in my death 
the siege of Amiens will have soften rock 
where cover all in shower of shot and fire 
I seem to all man eye a fight flame 
with bullet cut in fashion of a man 
a sacrifice to valour impious king 
which he will needs extinguish with my blood 
let he beware justice will fall from heaven 
in the same form I serve in that siege 
and by the light of that he shall decern 
what good my ill have bring he it will nothing 
assure his state the same quench he have cast 
upon my life shall quite put out his fame 
this day he lose what he shall not find 
by all day he survive so good a servant 
nor Spain so great a foe with who ahlas 
because I treat be I put to death 
it be put a politic gloze my courage raise i 
for the dear price of five and thirty scar 
and that have ruine i I thank my star 
come I will go where you will you shall not lead i 

I fear his frenzy 
never see I man of such a spirit so amaze at death 

he alter every minute what a vapour 
the strong mind be to a storm of cross exeunt 

o of what contrary consist a man 
of what impossible mixture vice and virtue 
corruption and eternness at one time 
and in one subject let together lose 
we have not any strength but weaken we 
no greatness but do crush we into air 
our knowledge do light we but to err 
our ornament be burden our delight 
be our tormentor fiend that raise in fear 
at part shake our roof about our ear 

o virtue thou be now far worse than fortune 
her gift stick by the duke when thou be vanish 
thou brave thy friend in need necessity 
that use to keep thy wealth contempt thy love 
have both abandon thou in his extreme 
thy power be shadow and thy comfort dream 

o real goodness if thou be a power 
and not a word alone in human use 
appear out of this angry conflagration 
where this great captain thy late temple burn 
and turn his vicious fury to thy flame 
from all earth hope mere guild with thy fame 
let piety enter with her willing cross 
and take he on it open his breast and arm 
to all the storm necessity can breathe 
and burst they all with his embrace death 

yet be the civil tumult of his spirit 
hot and outrageous not resolve alas 
be but one man render the kingdom doom 
he doubt storm threaten rue complain implore 
grief have bring all his force to his look 
and nought be leave to strengthen he within 
nor last one habit of those grieve aspect 
blood expel paleness paleness blood do chase 
and sorrow err through all form in his face 

so furious be he that the politic law 
be much to seek how to enact her sentence 
authority back with arm though he unarm 
abhor his fury and with doubtful eye 
view on what ground it shall sustain his ruin 
and as a savage boar that hunt long 
assail and set up with his only eye 
swim in fire keep of the bay hound 
though sink himself yet hold his anger up 
and snow it forth in foam hold firm his stand 
of battalous bristle feed his hate to die 
and whet his tusk with wrathful majesty 
So fare the furious duke and with his look 
do teach death horror make the hangman learn 
new habit for his bloody impudence 
which now habitual horror from he drive 
who for his life shun death by which he live 

will not your lordship have the duke distinguish 
from other prisoner where the order be 
to give up man condemn into the hand 
of the executioner he will be the death 
of he that he shall die by ere he suffer 
such a abjection 

but to bind his hand 
I hold it pass needful 

it be my lord 
and very dangerous to bring he lose 

you will in all despair and fury plunge he 
if you but offer it 

my lord by this 
the prisoner spirit be something pacify 
and it be a fear that the offer of those band 
will breed fresh fury in he and disturb 
the entry of his soul into her peace 

I will not that for any possible danger 
that can be wrought by his unarm hand 
and therefore in his own form bring he in 

where shall this weight fall on what region 
must this decline prominent pour his load 
I will break my blood high billow against my star 
before this will be shake into a flat 
all France shall feel a earthquake with what murmur 
this world shrink into chaos 

good my lord 
forgo it willing and now resign 
your sensual power entire to your soul 

horror of death let i alone in peace 
and leave my soul to i who it concern 
you have no charge of it I feel her free 
how she do rouse and like a falcon stretch 
her silver wing as threaten death with death 
at who I joyful will cast she off 
I know this body but a sink of folly 
the groundwork and raise frame of woe and frailty 
the bond and bundle of corruption 
a quick corpse only sensible of grief 
a walk sepulchre or household thief 
a glass of air break with less than breath 
a slave bind face to face to death till death 
and what say all you more I know beside 
that life be but a dark and stormy night 
of senseless dream terror and break sleep 
a tyranny devise pain to plague 
and make man long in die rack his death 
and death be nothing what can you say more 
I bring a long globe and a little earth 
be seat like earth betwixt both the heaven 
that if I rise to heaven I rise if fall 
I likewise fall to heaven what strong faith 
have any of your soul what say you more 
why lose I time in these thing talk of knowledge 
it serve for inward use I will not die 
like to a clergy man but like the captain 
that pray on horseback and with sword in hand

and king suspicion needs no balance

which I desire in i may end my wrong 
commend my love I charge you to my brother 
and by my love and misery command they 
to keep their faith that bind they to the king 
and prove no stomacher of my misfortune 
nor come to court till time have eat out 
the blot and scar of my opprobrious death 
and tell the earl my dear friend of D'Auvergne 
that my death utter be free from grief 
but for the sad loss of his worthy friendship 
and if I have be make for long life 
I will have more deserve he in my service 
beseech he to know I have not use 
one word in my arraignment that may touch he 
have I no other want then so ill meaning 
and so farewell for ever never more 
shall any hope of my revival see i 
such be the endless exile of dead man 
summer succeed the spring autumn the summer 
the frost of winter the fall leaf of autumn 
all these and all fruit in they yearly fade 
and every year return but curse man 
shall never more renew his vanish face 
fall on your knee than statist ere you fall 
that you may rise again knee bend too late 
stick you in earth like statue see in i 
how you be pour down from your clear heaven 
fall low yet mix with the unmoved centre 
that your own shadow may no long mock you 
strick strike oh strike 
fly fly command soul 
and on thy wing for this thy body breath 
bear the eternal victory of death
