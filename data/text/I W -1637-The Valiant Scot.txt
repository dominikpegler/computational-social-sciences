dread liege 
if all the youthful blood that I have spend

merit the name of hangman Grimsby cast 
they and himself at royal Edward foot 
and like a out wear soldier humble beg

in strong rebellion 

this be your kingdom Bruce 

I have no hand in it tho 

shall have no head do we but think it 
who be the chief 

one Wallace a fellow mean breed 
but spirit above belief 

some needy borderer 
how be our bosom part be their power 
of any strength Bruce leafy power for France 
if we but thought thou touch in it warlike Percy 
Beaumont and Sebastian fetch he in 
or with a second and more fatal conquest 
ruin that stubborn nation 

gracious Edward 
though war have make they subject heaven defend 
subject shall make they vassal 

we conceit you 
if any officer of we transgress 
our will or go beyond his bound prefix 
we will have his head he our high worth deprave 
that our free subject seek to make his slave 

we do not 

see we find it not 

let Ellianor win so much favour as to march along 
tho conquer alas we be neighbour of one clime 
and live like they subject to change and time 

royal Edward 
though Wallace and some spleenful dissolute 
wrong with the yoke of bondage cast it off 
let not the whole land suffer 

nor do we wish it Grimsby shall the fate 
but turn the wheel we may with they change state 
be Scotland subject let but rebellion kneel 
we will wear soft mercy and cast off rough steel 

I will undertake it 

let messenger be send 
to question the proud rebel and if Grimsby 
fail in his plot Northumberland and Clifford 
shall second he in arm so slight a foe 
must not detain we from our french design 
our queen have all our breast and though we may 
just perhaps confine your liberty 
Bruce we enlarge it give you command 
in our french war observe he near lord 
I have read this maxim in state policy 
be sure to wear thy danger in thy eye 
France light a comet Scotland a blaze star 
both seek for blood we will quench they both with war 

prithee good Wallace 

ill betide his soul 
that speak of goodness think or meditate 
of any goodness more than how to free 
imprison peg 

but hear i 

castle wear but a slender bolt of brick 

turn mad 

and say the moat be fifty fathom deep 
fifty time fifty say it reach through to hell 
Wallace will swim it 

swim it yes so will thrust a ox into a eggshell 
and roast it by moonshine but why shall Wallace 

why shall proud Selby though his forward son 
be just slay imprison peg 
poor lamb she be no murderer 

in my conscience she never draw weapon 
in anger in her life 

not at sharp I think but by your leave it be think 
she have practise in private put Wallace to foil and make 
he lie at his hang ward many a time and oft 

where be my son 

with Peggy father manacle of grief 
hang heavy on my sense 

shake they off 
show thyself worthy he that thou call father 
or Peggy die

it be time for providence to stir the king 
I know not upon what complaint pretend 
this rank rebellion rather take his root 
from wrong in we than treachery in Wallace 
And send his force rather to examine 
and question our demeanour than their treason 
we must prevent it how think you sir Jeffery 

troth even as you think policy must prevent it 

sir John Graham crave conference with the commissioner

a man methinks of your experience 
respect and education shall not link 
yourself in such a chain of counterfeit 

nor have I lord but for your best advantage 
and England good traitor and dotterel 
be sell for all alike he that will take they 
must seem to do as they do imitate 
their vicious action strive to take upon he 
their idle folly join company and drive 
they into a net suspectless 

so do not Graham 

speak not before your knowledge you detain 
my only daughter prisoner will Selby 
and his colleague free she and pardon i 
if I dissolve the brood of traitor 
and give up Wallace in band 

let we daughter be produce 
and the execution for awhile defer 
though in her cause Selby have lose a son 
and with he all content so dear I tender 
the peace of Scotland and my sovereign good

Wallas revenge my death 
and for a favour keep my hindmost breath die 

and house it here 

where be Wallas never eye 
see such a ruthless massacre 

yes Grimsby 
Wallace can show a massacre will prove 
thy but a maygame 

terrible and strange 

do start at this then see a spectacle 
of force to stay the motion of the sphere 
or strike the sun dead in the brow of heaven 
look and like man short from the brow of thunder 
fall senseless death wound not so deep as wonder 

who bloody act be this 

the bloody act 
contrive and plot by experience villain 

who be the author 

judge they all speak English 
death best become that dialect 
the first be bloody Haslerig the second 
more villainlike be Selby but the three 
all have a hand in 

English ambassador Exit Mess 

they be welcome let not one sullen brow 
be see in all this fiery firmament 

welcome your business 

far more like a prince 
than a base rebel look the northern traitor 

thus to a rebel from a royal king 
if Wallace will confess himself a traitor 
and for his bloody outrage and theft 
crave mercy and submit himself to Edward 
there be hope of life 

still charitable english 

it be not he sure 
this look not like a man shall shake a kingdom 

this it he shall deny 
rape murder ruin all the son of war 
stand strive for the prey and once let loose 
shall not be check nor take up till rage 
be tire with murder and thyself in chain 
hang like a villain 

this be all perfect english have you yet speak 

we have 

then we begin 
and to a tyrant thus say a loyal subject 
if Edward will confess himself a tyrant 
and kingly felon and make good such theft 
as he and his have practise sue his peace 
by yield up his and himself to Wallace 
there be hope of life this if he shall deny 
rape murder ruin all the brood of war 
shall be let fly and never be lure of 
till they be gorge and bate with the heart 
of the proud king himself 

now speak a man 
will thrust jove from Olympus 

calm your spleen 
for now speak mercy if your country wrong 
grow from abuse in Edward substitute 
you shall have equal hear and the wrong 
punish in the deserver 

this shall not be English 
or if it be king Edward be no tyrant 

what answer Wallace 

first pray pardon i 
if like the work of a trouble sea 
my bosom rise in billow for though the wind 
that raise the storm be down yet the dear ruin 
lie still in view a father and a wife 
age beauty and religion for thou 
thousand shall weep as many wife 
shed purple tear for thou as many churchman 
offer their reek soul in sacrifice 
court city church the chamber of your king 
the chair of state shall be no privilege 

this be not Edward act 

yet such as Edward 
place in commission o it be a churlish storm 
and wretched I like a forlorn survivor 
leave to inter their dear remembrance 

good gentleman 

but bid relentless Edward 
send in the pirate Haslerig and Selby 
and in their hand letter of murt subscribe 
to make i master of my own revenge 
or like a ball wrap in a cloud of fire 
ruin shall fall upon his palace top 
pierce through the roof and in his chair of state 
solicit justice 

into his princely ear I will give your wrong 

will Wallace here advise
