and like the fury of the wind more loud 
by opposition such a providence 
may be i one day when I be a father 
and he for who advance my care be mean 
like i may with a fair and formal show 
disguise his thought too yet I be to blame 
for my affection to a dream a thing 
with which my eye only converse to hazard 
a father love and the rich peace it bring 
I will uncreate the face I dote upon 
and be myself or what my brother 
now Francisco you meet my father 

yes and he 
look as some news have much exalt he 
you be not so merry in the face what be it 

Nothing 

you hold no controversy with he

I can guess he be angry by his smile 
how do you part 

exceed kindly 

what change your complexion 

thou be deceive 
prithee how do man look that be in love 

why as they do before what alteration 
have you observe in i 

you have then a mistress 
and thrive upon her favour but thou be 
my brother I deliver thou a secret 
I be at St Sebastian last Sunday 
at Vesper 

be it a secret that you go to church 
you need not blush to tell your ghostly father 

I pray thou leave thy impertinence there I see 
so sweet a face so harmless so intent 
upon her prayer it frost my devotion 
to gaze on she till by degree I take 
her fair idea through my covetous eye 
into my heart and know not how to ease 
it since of the impression 

So proceed 

her eye do seem to labour with a tear 
which sudden take birth but overweigh 
with it be own swell drop upon her bosom 
which by reflection of her light appear 
as nature mean her sorrow for a ornament 
after her look grow cheerful and I see 
a smile shoot graceful upward from her eye 
as if they have gain a victory over grief 
and with it many beam twist themselves 
upon who golden thread the angel walk 
to and again from heaven 

I do believe 
by all these metaphor you be in love 
I see you have a fancy but proceed 
and be not melancholy 

I have tell thou all 

this be indeed a vision you have 
but see her all this while if I may counsel you 
you shall proceed her face be nothing when 
you have peruse the rest 

it be dangerous 

you must excuse i brother 
there can be no hurt in a handsome woman 
for if her face delight so much what will 
the enjoy of so sweet a pile of beauty 

thou have infuse a confidence I will 
embrace this counsel you shall with i brother 
and see how I behave myself the lady 
be not far off 

with all my heart I will pawn 
my life you shall enjoy she what be she 
of flesh and blood that will deny when she 
be fair court may I know the name 
of this love mrs you may clear your thought 
I dare have no design to wrong your love 

what think you brother of the fair Jacinta 

don Carlo daughter 

to that happy coast 
I now be sail we lose time clap on 
more wing thou feather God thou have put fire 
Francisco into my droop thought and as 
they have already bargain with the wind 
they be aloft and chide love lazy motion 

a word before you fly but be Jacinta 
your mistress then 

the beautiful Jacinta 
do think I shall prosper what be she 
of flesh and blood that can deny when she 
be fair court add to this my happiness 
that she be the mistress who from all her sex 
my father have make choice of for my courtship 
he have already treat with don Carlos 
and it be he last command I shall address 
my present visit to she 

very well 
if this be truth you need not trouble wing 
to overtake this lady to my knowledge 
I be serious now she have bestow her heart 
upon a friend who have already fortify 
himself against the world that will oppose 
his title to it 

from what intelligence 
have you gain this her father know it not 
Come these be but subtle pretence scatter 
by some who cunning thus hope to make 
themselves a victory by cut off 
more fruitful expectation this must 
not disengage i prithee walk 

I can produce my author here Fernando 
and with my blood defend that interest 
she give i with intent I shall preserve it 

how be she you Francisco 

Mine if heart 
have power to make assurance 

it be some happiness 
I have no stranger to oppose who high 
and stubborn soul will not release this treasure 
but make i force it through his blood Francisco 
and Fernando be two rillet from one spring 
I will not doubt he will resign to make 
i fortunate or shall his will be cold 
and some close thought suggest I have no privilege 
by elder birth but come a sly intruder 
upon his right of love there be a tie 
of nature and obedience to a father 
will make he give this blessing from his bosom 
and strip his amorous soul of all his wealth 
that may invest my wish 

I read not this 
in any of the reverend casuist 
no inequality be in our blood 
the law of nature mean we shall be equal 
it be first tyranny then partial custom 
make you more capable of land will you 
be lord of we because you be first bear 
and make our soul your tenant too when I have 
name you my elder brother I exclude 
all servitude justice that make i love you 
carry a equal law to both 
nay I can love you more if I consider you 
without the chain of blood a friend than all 
the bond of nature can enforce i to 
in both relation give i leave to love you 
as much as man but not resign my mistress 
you ascend high and persuade by what 
obedience be owe to a father 
they give we life a good son keep it for he 
and every drop bleed in their cause a glory 
I can acknowledge this and sacrifice 
life fortune a poor recompense to lose 
be they all multiply to show my duty 
but these be thing may be resign a mistress 
be not a wealth in balance with the world 
but much above the poise of all it be happiness 
and equal with our honour rivet 
into our soul it leave she not when death 
have shake this body off but fly with it 
more swift to love it in the other world 

you be very passionate 

I be very just 
and you shall find it brother ere you twine 
with my Jacinta i if vow may give 
possession of each other soul 

no more 
may she be worthy of thy heart till i 
do entertain a treason to divide you 
but I to satisfy my father must 
present myself and trust i will so manage 
my love to she as thou shall have no cause 
to interpret i a rival oh Francisco 
our love be of a kindred for i be 
devote to Felisarda to her cousin

Theodoro daughter 

we never yet change language nor do she 
imagine with what thought I honour she 
but here be the distraction thou can not 
expect more opposition from don Carlos 
than I must from my father if he know 
where I have place my heart 

let we assist 
each other then till time and some kind star 
mature our love 

let father look at wealth it be all their saint

I hope you hold i not sir less deserve 
than when you give i free access to plead

I must give due respect to man of honour 
nor be it fit I shall impose upon 
the freedom of jacinta love

and yet the blackbird in the bush see what 
present be will give my sister

if he will send his eye I will undertake 
to carry they to the jeweller they will off 
for pretty toadstone have no fear my mother

Jacinta 

sir 

she take herself much honour

be confident to trust i with your honour 
if it will pawn for any thing 

I be not perfect 
how to neglect Alberto yet and must I 
throw off Fernando but new entertain 
by your command the world will censure strange 

the world will praise thy wisdom and my care 
or if some giddy tongue condemn what be good 
must we be servile to that fear and lose 
that which will make we judge of their folly 
and damn it with a frown of state they be fool 
that dote upon those shadow idle talk 
the slime of earthworm that do shine to cozen 
infant it be fit we raise our thought to substance 

let modesty and nature plead a little 
if I appear not fond to entertain he 
I may collect more strength by time and counsel 
and for your satisfaction dare profess 
my lord have too much grace the low Jacinta 
with a pretence so noble but I shall 
be hold not worth his person and too light 
at his first breath of courtship to fall from 
my virgin strength and give myself his captive 

I shall allow that ceremony the count 
make a address 

I must use thrift in my delight my eye 
be proud and must be teach by absence how 
to value such a mistress I do miss the chambermaid 

it will become i to attend 

your pardon 
I will take it for a honour if your son 
be please but to my coach 

o my good lord 
so much I be your creature if you know 
but where to match i I will be your coachhorse 

So so jacinta star do smile upon she 
it will be a match be but my son as fair 
in expectation of a bride I will write 
nil ultra to my care he be to airy 
and volatile a wife will timely fix he 
and make he fit to manage my estate 
but he return I will feel his pulse 

thou see how near jacinta be to happiness 

I do some office in it she may thank i 
I first inspire his lordship 

such a providence 
to build thyself a fortune by some brave 
and noble marriage will become thy study 
and make thy father willing resign 
his breath with confidence to know thou wise 
to govern what my industry have gather 
what think thou of a wife 

I think little sir 
what shall I do with a wife 

imitate i and study fame and wealth 
to thy posterity have I with care 
acquire such a estate that must not last 
two generation 

the way to make it 
last be not to think of wive for my part 
sir with your pardon if I may speak free 
I have opinion once I be your son 
but fear by your narrow exhibition 
you love i not I have a controversy 
within my thought whether I shall resolve 
to geld myself or turn a beg friar 

a beg friar 

it be as I tell you sir 
this last I fix upon and have be study 
where I convenient may raise a sum 
to compass a hair shirt sir 
to make trial before I thrust myself 
point blank into the order 

thus wild son interpret still 
a prudent father but you may discharge 
your jealousy unless it be your own 
devotion to be chaste and live a recluse 

for that I can be rule I have not live 
after the rate of hate any woman 
but I can hear of marriage if it be 
your pleasure but these wife sir be such tickle 
thing not one hardly stay among a thousand 
beside unless you find one very rich 
a man may cast a way himself and get 
a bundle of beggary mouth that day and night 
be open like hell gate to feed I will not 
hazard my freedom and the blessing heaven 
have lend you sir upon a wife with nothing 

thy pension double for that word in earnest 
how much I like this wisdom take this purse 
I will have no account and find i out 
a wealthy maid or widow but not ugly 

no not illfavoured sir if she be rich 
a little old or cripple 

I will have thou 
mary a crooked deform thing because 
she may have child 

not unless she have 
a infinite wealth to make they straight sir 
I will marry a witch so she have money sir 

no on no term a monster 

then I will 
and now it come into my mind they talk of 
a young rich widow donna Estifania 
what do you think of she 

thou have name one 
to my own desire she live a widow still 
but she have refuse many brave don 

no matter 
I like her sir the better 

she give good entertainment 

I will have she 
if you but say the word I wear a charm 
to catch a widow but this purse will hardly 
last till we finish I must do thing with honour 

thou shall be furnish like my son kneel down 
and ask i blessing I do long to give it thou 

I have your blessing here 

I will find thou out 
some jewel to present thy mistress too 

it will be much amiss the gold will go 
the far sir I know not how this 
come about unless don Pedro come to 
my sister have make he mad and wrought this miracle 
how careful he be I shall not marry one 
deform I have choose the handsome thing thus far 
and I marry with a witch at these year let the devil 
ride my wild mare to death and now I 
consider on it I will have the widow 
for fear of the worst yet I will to she 
and make a business on it to keep the old 
man bag in motion this with some good 
husbandry and no play may last a fortnight 
it be very gold yes it will pay some score 
maintain my negro and a brace of whore 
now fiddle do your worst 

how no success where lie the opposition 
don Carlos equal with myself profess 
his free desire and to dispose his daughter 
to meet thou with all love entertainment 
what can she argue to thy birth or person 
attend with so plentiful a fortune 
I must believe thy courtship dull and faulty 
when I be at thy year and spring of blood 
I wound myself like air among the lady 
command every bosom and can dwell 
upon their lip like their own breath their eye 
double their beam on i and she that be 
of hard composition who no love 
can soften when I come with charm of language 
her frost will straight dissolve and from her eye 
her heart come weep forth to woo i take it 

yet you that do with a magnetic chain 
attract so many can possess but one 
I come not to don Carlos house with cold 
or lukewarm thought but arm with active fire 
that will have melt any heart but she 
bind up with rib of treble ice against i 
by which I find there be another fate 
that govern love against who secret doom 
in vain be eloquence or force 

so obstinate 

nothing that I can say 
in my own cause can make her tongue or look 
promise a expectation to thrive 
by any after service this disdain 
I do resent as it become my honour 
and now confirm against her pride have think 
of something that with your consent may tame 
her scorn or punish it to her repentance 

name it 

she have a kinswoman live with she 
Felisarda daughter to signior Teodore 
a trade fall merchant brother to don Carlos 
this Felis that now live on the charity of her uncle 
half servant half companion to jacinta 
and fair I will pretend to love observe i sir 
and in their presence court she as my mistress 
methinks I see already how jacinta 
do fret and frown 

I like it well 

to see her cousin so prefer it be 
the nature fir of woman to be vex 
when they know any of their servant court 
another and that love they think not worth 
their own reward will sting they to the soul 
when it be translate where it meet with love 
and this will either break her stubborn heart 
or humble she 

but what if this pretence 
by such degree convey away your heart 
that when Jacinta come to sense you can 
retrieve your passion from the last or say 
Felisarda shall believe you and give up 
her heart to your possession when you 
be by your first desire invite back 
what cure for Felisarda wound if you 
affect she not although I like that part 
of your revenge I will not have my son 
carry the hate brand of cruelty 
or hear Fernando break a lady heart 
but live upon his clear and honest truth 
and if Jacinta have not value he 
find his own estimation in some other 
by fair and noble courtship virtue be 
above the gaudy shine of gold and if 
my son love where his honour can suffer 
the want of dower I can forgive 

you now read excellent charity and like a father 
it be the harmony I will hear I chide 
my fear that do suspect you will prefer 
wealth in a bride there be no beauty or estate compare 
to that result from the soul I dare 
now open this narrow closet and present 
the name I love above the world it be 
sir Felisarda equal in her blood 
within who virtuous poverty 
more treasure be contain than in those vein 
of earth which open by our slave do bleed 
such flood of gold into the lap of Spain 
pardon my long concealment of her name 
it be sin against your virtue and once more 
speak in that bless language I may hope 
to call this virgin i 

how long have you 
be take with this female holiness 

before Jacinta be propound this 
take firm possession of my faith 

thou have discover thy destruction foolish boy 
be this your policy to be revenge 
upon Jacinta who my providence 
elect to preserve our name and family 
to dote upon a beggar thou have fling 
a fire into my brain either resolve 
to perfect my command and throw off 
that trifle thou have praise prefer Jacinta 
to the best seat within thy heart and marry she 
or live a stranger to i and divest 
of all those right which nature and thy birth 
have flatter thou with hope to find expect not 
alive the stipend of a groom to feed thou 
nor dead the naked charity of a shroud 
to hide thou from the worm 

o sir call back 
that murder sentence it be sin to let 
this passion dwell upon you nor will heaven 
who eye survey our frailty suffer 
so wild a rage possess you 

it be within thy own obedience to divert it 

when you have hear what I can say more 
you will chide your fierce command 

what riddle this 

Jacinta be already make another and my force 
upon her vow can be no less than sacrilege 

this be some new pretence 

sir not to waste your patience she have give 
herself by holy contract to Francisco 

thy young brother 

this I know will calm 
your fury and those eye that threaten lightning 
with smile applaud Francisco fate and praise 
my disobedience 

Francisco mistress 

his wife confirm by vow and change of heart 
I have it from themselves when either strive 
who circumstance shall credit most their story 
her tear or his conclusive groan to seal 
their marriage but both be equal sir 
what curse have I deserve that shall divorce 
this innocent pair of lover 

all this talk 
which foolish thou interpret thy defence 
have but enlarge thy folly and that act 
which in Francisco I commend upbraid 
thy own degenerate baseness shall thy brother 
who carry all his portion in his blood 
look high and careful of his honour aim 
at fortune and with confidence achieve 
his glorious end and shall his elder brother 
engage by near tie to advance his name 
lie beat in the common tract of gull 
and sacrifice his birth and expectation 
to a cozen face and poverty instead 
of add monument that to the world 
shall be his live chronicle to bury 
his own and all the antique honour he 
never sweat for but be cast into his blood 
within a dunghill thou have forfeit 
thy birthright which Francisco shall inherit 
nor shall the loss of my estate be all 
thy punishment hear and believe with horror 
if thou renounce not she that have bewitch 
thy heart Felisarda and by such a choice 
I shall affect redeem this scandal noble 
Fernando from this minute I pronounce 
heir to his father curse be wise or perish 

why do not all the stock of thunder fall 
or the fierce wind from their close cave let loose 
now shake i into atom 

fie noble brother what can so deject 
your masculine thought be this do like Fernando 
who resolute soul so late be arm to fight 
with all the misery of man and triumph 
with patience of a martyr I observe 
my father late come from you 

yes Francisco 
he have leave his curse upon i 

how 

his curse do comprehend what that word carry 
shot from a father angry breath unless 
I tear poor Felisarda from my heart 
he have pronounce i heir to all his curse 
do this fright thou Francisco thou have cause 
to dance in soul for this it be only I 
must lose and mourn thou shall have all I be 
degrade from my birth while he affect 
thy forward youth and only call thou son 
son of his active spirit and applaud 
thy progress with Jacinta in who smile 
thou may see all thy wish wait for thou 
while poor Fernando for her sake must stand 
a excommunicate from every blessing 
a thing that dare not give myself a name 
but fling into the world necessity 
until in time with wonder of my want 
I turn a ragged statue on who forehead 
each clown may carve his motto 

will it call 
his blessing back if you can quit your love 
to Felisarda she be now a stranger 
to her uncle house I meet one of his servant 
who tell i on some jealous apprehension 
don Carlos have discharge and banish she 

he can not be so barbarous 

you know her father poverty 

and her wealth of virtue 

it be worth your counsel 
to examine what you may preserve if wise 
you can persuade your heart to love some neither 

what be it Francisco say 

who equal birth 
and virtue may invite a noble change 

do not you love Jacinta 

most religious 

if you can but contrive your heart at distance 
and in contempt of honour and your faith 
sacred to heaven and love disclaim your mistress 
I may be happy yet what say I know 
Jacinta wise and when she understand 
how much it will advance her charity 

our case be not the same with you good brother 
we have be long acquaint to contract 
affection if I understand your love 
be young and have no time for growth 

do not wound i 
it be false by love itself thou have deserve 
I shall forget thou now do thou consider 
love that do make all harmony in our soul 
and seat in that noble place of life 
the heart with thing that be the slave of time 
and that like common seed throw into earth 
it must have leisure to corrupt and after 
much expectation rise to name and vigour 
love be not like the child that grow and get 
by slow degree perfection but create 
like the first man at full strength the first minute 
it make a noble choice and gain from time 
to be call only constant not increase 
preserve thy own affection and think my 
noble as they I shall suspect thy love 
to i else prithee leave i 

I will obey 
and study how to serve you 

ha it be Felisarda

poor Felisarda wander be it not 
to ask a father blessing I will visit

how soon the coast be clear to visit you

such haste to be within thy arm

with tear I prophesy a joy shall weigh 
down all our suffering I see comfort break 
like day who forehead cheer the world if don 
Fernando love thou he be a gentleman 
confirm in all that be honourable and can 
forget who his own virtue have make choice 
to shine upon 

unless my innocence 
apt to believe a flatter tongue see not 
the serpent couch and hide his speckle breast 
among the flower but it be sin to think 
he can dissemble father and I know not 
since I be first the object of his charity 
I find a pious gratitude disperse 
within my soul and every thought of he 
engender a warm sigh within i which 
like curl of holy incense overtake 
each other in my bosom and enlarge 
with their embrace his sweet remembrance 

cherish 
those thought and where such noble worth invite 
be bold to call it love 

it be too much 
ambition to hope he shall be just 
to i or keep his honour when I look on 
the pale complexion of my want and yet 
unless he love i dear I be lose 
and if he have but mock i into faith 
he may as well have murder i for I 
shall have no heart to live if his neglect 
deface what my affection print there 

there be no fear of his revolt lose not 
his character I must attend some business 
if don Fernando visit thou preserve 
his fair opinion and thou may live 
above thy uncle pity 

will you leave i 

my stay shall not be long the garden will 
with smile flower encourage thou to walk 
and raise thy droop eye with hope to see 

why shall I 
give any entertainment to my fear 
suspicion be but like the shape of cloud 
and idle form in the air we make to fright we 
I will admit no jealous thought to wound 
Fernando truth but with that cheerfulness 
my own first clear intent to honour he 
can arm i with expect to meet his faith 
as noble as he promise ha it be he 

shall I want fortitude to bid he welcome 
sir if you think there be a heart alive 
that can be grateful and with humble thought 
and prayer reward your piety despite not 
the offer of it here you have not cast 
your bounty on a rock while the seed thrive 
where you do place your charity my joy 
may seem ill dress to come like sorrow thus 
but you may see through every tear and find 
my eye mean innocence and your hearty welcome 

who do prepare thou Felisarda thus 
to entertain i weep sure our soul 
meet and converse and we not know it there be 
such beauty in that watery circle I 
be fearful to come near and breathe a kiss 
upon thy cheek lest I pollute that crystal 
and yet I must salute thou and I dare 
with one warm sigh meet and dry up this sorrow 

I shall forget all misery for when 
I look upon the world and race of man 
I find they proud and all so unacquainted 
with pity to such miserable thing 
as poverty have make we that I must 
conclude you send from heaven 

o do not flatter 
thyself poor Felisarda I be mortal 
the life I bear about i be not i 
but borrow to come to thou once again 
and ere I go to clear how much I love thou 
but first I have a story to deliver 
a tale will make thou sad but I must tell it 
there be one dead that love thou not 

one dead 
that love not i this carry fir in nature 
no kill sound I shall be sad to know 
I do deserve a enemy or he want 
a charity at death 

thy cruel enemy 
and my best friend have take eternal leave 
and his go to heaven I hope excuse my tear 
it be a tribute I must pay his memory 
for I do love my father 

ha your father 

yes Felisarda he be go that in 
the morning promise many year but death 
have in few hour make he as stiff as all 
the wind and winter have throw cold upon he 
and whisper he to marble 

now trust i 
my heart weep for he but I understand 
not how I be concern in his displeasure 
and in such height as you profess 

he do 
command i on his blessing to forsake thou 
be it not a cruel precept to enforce 
the soul and curse his son for honest love 

this be a wound indeed 

but not so mortal 
for his last breath be balsom pour upon it 
by which he do reverse his malediction 
and I that groan beneath the weight of that 
anathema sink almost to despair 
where night and heavy shade hang round about i 
find myself rise like the morning star 
to view the world 

never I hope to be 
eclipse again 

this be a welcome blessing 

heaven have a care of both my joy be mighty 
vouchsafe i sir your pardon if I blush 
and say I love but rather than the peace 
that shall preserve your bosom suffer for 
my sake it be better I be dead 

no live 
and live for ever happy thou deservede it 
it be Fernando do make haste to sleep 
in his forget dust 

those accent do 
not sound so cheerful 

do love i 

sir 

do not I prithee do not I be lose 
alas I be no more Fernando there 
be nothing but the empty name of he 
that do betray thou place a guard about 
thy heart be time I be not worth this sweetness 

do not Fernando speak all this alas 
he know that I be poor before and need not 
despise i now for that 

desert i goodness 
when I upbraid thy want it be I be poor 
for I have not a stock in all the world 
of so much dust as will contrive one narrow 
cabin to shroud a worm my die father 
have give away my birthright to Francisco 
I be disinherit throw out of all 
but the small earth I borrow thus to walk on 
and have nothing leave I come to kiss thou 
and take my everlasting leave of thou too 
farewell this will persuade thou to consent 
to my eternal absence 

I must beseech you stay a little sir 
and clear my faith have your displease father 
deprive you then of all and make Francisco 
the lord of your inheritance without hope 
to be repair in fortune 

it be sad truth 

this be a happiness I do not look for 

a happiness 

yes sir a happiness 

can Felisarda take delight to hear 
what have undo her servant 

heaven avert it 
but it be not worth my grief to be assure 
that this will bring i near now to he 
who I most honour of the world and it be 
my pride if you exceed i not in fortune 
that I can boast my heart as high and rich 
with noble flame and every way your equal 
and if you be as poor as I Fernando 
I can deserve you now and love you more 
than when your expectation carry all 
the pride and blossom of the spring upon it 

those shadow will not feed more than our fancy 
two poverty will keep but a thin table 
and while we dream of this high nourishment 
we do but starve more glorious 

it be ease 
and wealth first teach we art to surfeit by 
nature be wise not costly and will spread 
a table for we in the wilderness 
and the kind earth keep we alive and healthful 
with what her bosom do invite we to 
the brook not there suspect as the wine 
that sometime prince quaff be all transparent 
and with their pretty murmur call to taste they 
in every tree a chorister to sing 
health to our love our life shall there be free 
as the first knowledge be from sin and all 
our dream as innocent 

o Felisarda 
if thou do own less virtue I may prove 
unkind and marry thou but be so rich 
in goodness it become i not to bring 
one that be poor in every worth to waste 
so excellent a dower be free and meet 
one that have wealth to cherish it I shall 
undo thou quite but pray for i as I 
that thou may change for a more happy bridegroom 
I dare as soon be guilty of my death 
as make thou miserable by expect i 
farewell and do not wrong my soul to think 
that any storm can separate we two 
but that I have no fortune now to serve thou 

this will be no exception sir I hope 
when we be both dead yet our body may 
be cold and stranger in the wind sheet 
we shall be marry when our spirit meet

although I meet he in his mistress arm 
the lover sanctuary I dare force Francisco 
and with my sword cut the embrace that chain he 
rather than he shall glory in my ruin 
and revel out those honour with she he 
take from my blood 

it shall not need Fernando 

Hum here be like to be a bloody business 
I will not disturb they 

as you be brother by your father dust 
that shall sleep quiet in his urn by her 
dear name that give you life that now pray for you 
chide this unnatural fury 

what demand Fernando 

my inheritance wrought from i 
by thy sly creep to supplant my birth 
and cheat our father easy soul unworthy 
betray to his anger for thy lust 
of wealth the love and promise of two heart 
poor Felisarda and Fernando now 
wither at soul and robe by thou of that 
shall cherish virtue like to rifle pilgrim 
meet on the way and have tell their story 
and drop their even tear for both their loss 
wander from one another 

it be not sure 

but his passion that obey not 
the counsel of his reason will accuse i 
and if my father now since spirit lose not 
intelligence but more active when they have 
shake off their chain of flesh will leave his dwell 
and visit this course orb again my innocence 
shall dare the appeal and make Fernando see 
his empty accusation 

he that thrive 
by wicked art have confidence to dress 
his action with simplicity and shape 
to cheat our credulous nature it be my wonder 
thou dare do so much injury Francisco 
as must provoke my justice to revenge 
yet wear no sword 

I need no guard I know 
thou dare not kill i 

dare I not 

and name thy cause it be thy suspicion not Franciso 
have wrought thou high and passionate to assure it 
if you dare violate I dare possess you 
wit hall my title to your land 

how be that 
will you resign the interest to such 
a fair estate and wrong my daughter sir 

let he receive it at his peril 

ha 

it be my father act not i he tremble 
to hear his curse alive what horror will 
his conscience feel when he shall spurn his dust 
and call the reverend shade from his bless seat 
to this bad world again to walk and fright he 

I be abuse 

can this be more than dream 

sir you may cancel it but think withal 
how you can answer he that be dead when he 
shall charge your timorous soul for this contempt 
to nature and religion to break 
his last bequest and breath that seal your blessing 

these be fine fancy 

here and may it prosper 
where my good father mean it I be overcome 
forgive i and enjoy it I may find 
some earth that be not thou where I may die 
and take up a dark chamber love Jacinta 
and while I seek out where to be forget 
live happy and divide the spring between you
