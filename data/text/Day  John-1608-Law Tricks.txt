wrong not the law 

I can it be divine 
and I will compare it to a golden chain 
that link the body of a commonwealth 
into a firm and formal union

it be twine to justice and with holy zeal 
right determine the poor man appeal 
and those that be law true administer 
be father to the wrong heaven justicer 

foregod it be true right property of the law 
but under favour and with due respect 
of that unvalued pearl and the professor 
yourself and such lacklatin advocate 
infect the heart and do their best to change 
the true intent of sanctimonious law 
turn church yard champion and make the ground grow rank with grandsire flesh 
bear corn to feed the son 

will this be suffer 
but Polymetes in thy stay at Pisa 
when hear thou of thy sister 

much too late 
the reason with your patience I will relate 
beauteous Emilia who I never see 
but in the rhetoric of discursive tongue 
in sancta monta neighbour to Sardinia 
where silver Arno in her crystal bosom 
court the fresh bank with many a amorous kiss 
my sister as the country custom claim 
with all the choice virgin of the land 
meet at the temple half a league remote 
from all resort of people which be deck 
with all the relic and the choice lemme 
Marseilles Pisa or Leghorn can yield 

what follow this rich preparation 

while they secure tend their orison 
three arm galley of the faithless Turk 
at this advantage set their man on shore 
enter the temple and profane their shrine 
on the high altar sacrifice the priest 
disray the temple of the golden robe 
murder the matron ravish the maid 
and drag they by the disheveld hair 
do with their ravish body fill their boat 
among the rest Emilia who report 
call by no name but only beautiful 
be ravish slay or take prisoner
