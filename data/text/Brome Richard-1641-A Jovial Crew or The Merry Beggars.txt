as the highway and commons be the shade 
of sycamore and bower of eglantine

the trouble stream where every beast do drink 
do not the bird sing here as sweet and lively 
as any other where be not thy bed more soft 
and rest more safe then in a field or barn 
be a full table which be call thy own

what air be want 

o sir you have hear of pilgrimage and the voluntary travel of good man 

for penance or to holy end but bring not those into comparison I charge you 

I do not sir but pardon i to think their suffering be much sweeten by delight such as we find by shift place and air

yield not variety enough try further 
provide your deportment be gentile 
take horse and man and money you have all 
or I will allow enough 

o how be I confound 
dear sir retort i naked to the world 
rather than lay those burden on i which 
will stifle i I must abroad or perish 

I will no long strive to wash this moor 
nor breathe more minute so unthrifty 
in civil argument against rude wind 
but rather practise to withdraw my love 
and tender care if it be possible 
from that unfruitful breast incapable 
of wholesome counsel 

have I your leave sir 

I leave you to dispute it with yourself 
I have no voice to bid you go or stay

and leave the effect to time and providence exit 

I be confound in my obligation 
to this good man his virtue be my punishment 
when it be not in my nature to return 
obedience to his merit I can wish 
such a ingratitude be death by the law 
and put in present execution on i 
you rid i of my sharp suffering 
nor but by death can this predominant sway 
of nature be extinguish in i I 
have fight with my affection by the assistance 
of all the strength of art and discipline 
all which I owe he for in education too 
to conquer and establish my observance 
as in all other rule to he in this 
this inborn strong desire of liberty 
in that free course which he detest as shameful 
and I approve my earth felicity 
but find the war be endless and must fly 
what must I lose then a good master love 
what loss feel he that want not what he lose 
they will say I lose all reputation 
what be that to live where no such thing be know 
my duty to a master will be question 
where duty be exact it be none 
and among beggar each man be his own 
now fellow what new from whence you come 

the old wont news sir from your guesthouse the old barn we have unload the breadbasket the beefkettle and the beerbumbard there among your guest the beggar and they have all pray for you and our master as their manner be from the tooth outward marry from the tooth inward it be enough to swallow your alm from whence I think their prayer seldom come 

thou shall not think uncharitable 

thought be free master steward and it please you but your charity be nevertheless notorious I must needs say 

meritorious thou mean to say 

Surely sir no it be out of our curate book 

but I aspire no merit nor popular thank it be well if I do well in it 

it may be better though if old Randal who you allow to talk may counsel to help to breed up poor man child or decay labourer past their work or travel or towards the set up of poor young marry couple then to bestow a hundred pound a year at least you do that if not all you get beside our master bounty to maintain in beg such wanderer as these that never be out of their way that can give account from whence they come or whither they will nor of any beginning they ever have or any end they seek but still to stroll and beg till their belly be full and then sleep till they be hungry 

thou be ever repine at those poor people they take nothing from thou but thy pain and that I pay thou for too why shall thou grudge 

be I not bite to it every day by the sixfooted bloodhound that they leave in their litter when I throw out the old to lay fresh straw for the new comer at night that be one part of my office and you be sure that though your hospitality be but for a night and a morning for one rabble to have a new supply every evening they take nothing from i indeed they give too much 

thou be old Randall still I ever grumble but still officious for they 

yes hang they they know I love they well enough I have have merry bout with some of they 

what say thou Randall 

they be indeed my pastime I leave the merry grigs as their provender have prick they in such a hoy yonder such a frolic you will hear anon as you walk near they 

well honest Randal thus it be I be for a journey I know not how long will be my absence but I will present take order with the cook pantler and butler for my wont allowance to the poor and I will leave money with thou to manage the affair till my return 

then up rise Randal Bayley of the beggar 

and if our master shall be displease although the charge be i at the openness of the entertainment thou shall then give it proportionable in money and let they walk far 

Pseugh that will never do it never do they good it be the seat the habitation the rendezvous that cheer their heart money will clog their conscience nor must I lose the music of they in their lodging 

we will agree upon it anon go now about your business 

I go Bayley nay steward and chamberlain of the rogue and beggar Exit 

I can think but with a tremble fear 
on this adventure in a scruple which 
I have not weigh with all my other doubt 
I shall in my departure rob my master 
of what of a true servant other theft 
I have commit none and that may be supply 
and better too by some more constant to he 
but I may injure many in his trust 
which now he can be but spare of 
I rob he too of the content and hope 
he have in i who he have build and raise 
unto that growth in his affection 
that I become a gladness in his eye 
and now must be a grief or a vexation 
unto his noble heart but hark i there be 
the harmony that drown all doubt and fear 
a little near 

the emperor hear no such music nor feel content like this 

Most ravish delight but in all this 
only one sense be please my ear be feast 
my eye too must be satisfy with my joy

concern Springlove and yourself mistress Amie 

well lady my confidence in you that you be the same that you have protest yourselves to be have so far win upon i that I confess myself wellaffected both to the mind and person of that Springlove And if he be as fair you pretend a gentleman I shall easy dispense with fortune 

he be upon our honour 

how well that high engagement suit your habit 

our mind and blood be still the same 

I have pass no affiance to the other 
that steal i from my guardian and the match 
he will have force i to from which I will 
have flee with any or without a guide 
beside his mind more clownish than his habit 
deprave by covetousness and cowardice 
force i into a way of misery 
to take relief from beggar 

from poor we 

and then to offer to marry i under a hedge as the old couple be today without book or ring by the chaplain of the beggar regiment your patrico only to save charge 

I have not see the wretch these three hour whither be he go 

he tell i to fetch horse and sit raiment for we and so to post i hence but I think it be to leave i on your hand 

he have take some great distaste sure for he be damnable jealous 

ay do thou mark what a wild look he cast when Springlove tumble she and kiss she on the straw this morning while the music play to the old weddingfolk 

yes and then Springlove to make he mad tell he that he will be his proxy and marry she for he and lie with she the first night with a naked cudgel betwixt they and make he a king of beggar 

I see how it anger he and I imagine then and before that there be more in Springlove then downright beggar but though he be never so good a gentleman he shall observe sit time and distance till we be marry 

matrimony forbid else she be take but while we talk of a match towards we be miss within in the bridebarn among the revel rout 

we have have all the sport they can make we in the past passage 

how cautious the old contract couple be for portion and jointure 

what feoffee she be a heir of fourscore and seven year stoneblind have in trust for her estate 

and how careful he secure all to himself in case he outlive she be but seven year old than she and what pain the lawyer of the rout here take about it 

and then how solemn they be join and admonish by our parson underhedge to live together in the fear of the lash and give good example to the young reprobate to beg within compass to escape the jaw of the justice the clutch of the constable the hook of the headborough and the bite blow of the beadle And in so do they shall defy the devil and all his work and after their painful pilgrimage in this life they shall die in the ditch of delight 

o but poet scribble epithalamium to the blind virgin of fourscore and the lame bachelor of more how Cupid give she fies to see and Vulcan lend he leg how Venus cause their sport to be prepare with butter egg yet when she shall be seven year wed she shall be bold to say she have as much her maidenhead as on her wedding day 
to the blind virgin of fourscore 
and the lame bachelor of more 
how Cupid give she fies to see 
and Vulcan lend he leg 
how Venus cause their sport to be 
prepare with butter egg 
yet when she shall be seven year wed 
she shall be bold to say 
she have as much her maidenhead 
as on her wedding day 

so may some wife that be marry at sixteen to lad of one and twenty 

but at the weddingfeast when the bride bridle it and her groom saddle it there be the sport in she mump and his champ the crew scramble ourselves tremble then the confusion of noise in talk laugh scold sing howl with their action of snatch scratch touse and louse themselves and one another enter Springl Vinc and Hilliard but who come here
