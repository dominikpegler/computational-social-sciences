then sir you have best let some wise man sit on your son to hatch he a good wit they say if raven sit on hen egg the chicken will be black and so forth 

why boy my son be out of the shell and be grow a pretty cock

I marvel he be such a ass he take it not of his father

rascal do thou imagine thy mistress nought of her body 

no but fantastical of her mind and it may be when this boy be beget she think of a fool and so conceive a fool yourself be very wise and she surpass honest 

it may be for I have hear of a aethiopian that think of a fair picture bring forth a fair lady and yet no bastard 

you be well read sir your son may be a bastard and yet legitimate yourself a cuckold and yet my mistress virtuous all this in conceit 

Come Dromio it be my grief to have such a son that must inherit my land 

he need not sir I will beg he for a fool 

vile boy thy young master 

let i have in a device 

I will have thy advice and if it fadge thou shall eat thou shall sweat play till thou sleep and sleep till thy bone ache 

I marry now you tickle i I be both hungry gamesome and sleepy and all at once I will break this head against the wall but I will make it bleed good matter 

then this it be thou know I have but one son and he be a fool 

a monstrous fool 

a wife and she a errand scold 

ah master I smell your device it will be excellent 

thou can not know it till I tell it 

I see it through your brain your hair be so thin and your scull so transparent I may soon see it than hear it 

then boy have thou a quick wit and I a slow tongue but what be it 

marry either you will have your wife tongue in your son head that he may be a prate fool or his brain in her brain pan that she may be a foolish scold 

thou dream Dromio there be no such matter thou know I have keep he close so that my neighbour think he to be wise and she to be temperate because they never hear they speak 

well 

thou know that Stellio have a good farm and a fair daughter yea so fair that she be mew up and only look out at the window lest she shall by some roist courtier be steal away 

so sir 

now if I can compass a match between my son and Stellio daughter by conference of we parent and without they I shall be bless he cozen and thou for ever set at liberty 

a singular conceit 

thus much for my son now for my wife I will have this keep from she else shall I not be able to keep my house from smoke for let it come to one of her ear and then woe to both i I will have she go to my house into the country while we conclude this and this once do I care not if her tongue never have do these if thou can effect thou shall make thy master happy 

think it do this noddle shall coin such new device as you shall have your son marry by tomorrow 

but take heed that neither the father nor the maid speak to my son for then his folly will mar all 

Lay all the ear on i sublevabo te onere I will rid you of a fool 

will thou rid i for a fool 

tush quarrel not 

then for the dowry let it be at least two hundred ducat and after his death the farm 

what else 

then let we in that I may furnish thou with some better counsel and my son with better apparel 

let i alone I lack but a wag more to make of my counsel and than you shall see a exquisite cozenage and the father more fool than the son but hear you sir I forget one thing 

what be that 

nay expellas furca licet usque recurret 

what be the meaning 

why though your son folly be thrust up with a pair of horn on a fork yet be natural it will have his course 

I pray thou no more but about it 

Risio my daughter be pass amiable but very simple 

you mean a fool sir 

faith I imply so much 

then I apply it fit the one she take of her father the other of her mother now you may be sure she be your own 

I have pen she up in a chamber have only a window to look out that youth see her fair cheek may be enamour before they hear her fond speech how like thou this head 

there be very good workmanship in it but the matter be but base if the stuff have be as good as the mould your daughter have be as wise as she be beautiful 

do thou think she take her foolishness of i 

ay and so cunning that she take it not from you 

well quod natura dedit tollere Nemo potest 

a good evidence to prove the feesimple of your daughter folly 

why 

it come by nature and if none can take it away it be perpetual 

nay Riscio she be no natural fool but in this consist her simplicity that she think herself self subtle in this her rudeness that she imagine she be courtly in this the overshoot of herself that she overween of herself 

well what follow 

Risio this be my plot Memphio have a pretty stripling to his son who with cocker he have make wanton his girdle must be warm the air must not breathe on he he must lie abed till noon and yet in his bed break his fast that which I do to conceal the folly of my daughter that do he in too much cocker of his son now Risio how shall I compass a match between my girl and his boy 

why with a pair of compass and bring they both into the circle he warrant they will match themselves 

tush plot it for i that never speak one to another they be in love one with another I like not solemn woo it be for courtier let country folk believe other report as much as their own opinion 

o then so it be a match you care not 

not I nor for a match neither be it not I thirst after my neighbour farm 

a very good nature well if by flat wit I bring this to pass what be my reward 

whatsoever thou will ask 

I will ask no more than by my wit I can get in the bargain 

then about it 

if I come not about you never trust i I will seek out Dromio the counsellor of my conceit 

it be unneighbourly do to suffer your son since he come from school to spend his time in love and unwise do to let he hover over my daughter who have nothing to her dowry but her needle and must prove a sempster nor he any thing to take to but a grammar and can at the best be but a schoolmaster 

Prisius you bite and whine wring i on the withers and yet winch yourself it be you that go about to match my girl with my boy she be more fit for seam than for marriage and he for a rod than a wife 

her birth require a better bridegroom than such a groom 

and his bring up another gate marriage than such a minion 

marry gup I be sure he have no better bread than be make of wheat nor wear fine cloth than be make of will nor learn better manner than be teach in school 

nor your minx have no better grandfather than a tailor who as I have hear be poor and proud nor a better father than yourself unless your wife borrow a better to make her daughter a gentlewoman 

twit not i with my ancestor nor my wife honesty if thou do 

hold thy hand still thou have best and yet it be impossible now I remember for thou have the palsy 

my hand shake so that be thou in place where I will teach thou to cog 

nay if thou shake thy hand I warrant thou can not teach any to cog but neighbour let not two old fool fall out for two young wanton 

Indeed it become man of our experience to reason not rail to debate the matter not to combat it 

well than this I will tell thou friendly I have almost these two year cast in my head how I may match my princock with Stellio daughter who I have hear to be very fair and know shall be very rich she be his heir he dote he be stoop old and short must die yet by no mean either by blessing or curse can I win my son to be a wooer which I know proceed not of bashfulness but stubbornness for he know his good though I say it he have wit at will as for his personage I care not who see he I can tell you he be able to make a lady mouth water if she wink not 

stay Sperantus this be like my case for I have be tamper as long to have a marriage commit between my wench and Memphio only son they say he be as goodly a youth as one shall see in a summer day and as neat a stripling as ever go on neat leather his father will not let he be forth of his sight he be so tender over he he yet lie with his mother for catch cold now my pretty else as proud as the day be long she will none of he she forsooth will choose she own husband make marriage prove mad marriage she will choose with her eye and like with her heart before she consent with her tongue neither father nor mother kith nor kin shall be her carver in a husband she will fall too where she like best and thus the chick scarce out of the shell cackle as though she have be tread with a hundred cock and mother of a thousand egg 

well then this be our best see we know each other mind to devise to govern our own child for my boy I will keep he to his book and study shall make he leave to love I will break he of his will or his bone with a cudgel 

and I will no more dandle my daughter she shall prick on a clout till her finger ache or I will cause she leave to make my heart ache but in good time though with ill luck behold if they be not both together let we stand close and hear all so shall we prevent all 

This happen pat take heed you cough not Prisius 

tush spit not you and I will warrant I my beard be as good as a handkerchief 

sweet Candius if thy father shall see we alone will be not fret the old man methinks shall be full of fume 

tush let he fret one heart string against another he shall never trouble the least vain of my little finger the old churl think none wise unless he have a beard hang dangle to his waist when my face be bedaub with hair as he then perchance my conceit may stumble on his staidness 

ay in what book read you that lesson 

I know not in what book he read it but I be sure he be a knave to learn it 

I believe fair Livia if your sour fire shall see you with your sweet heart he will not be very patient 

the care be take I will ask he blessing as a father but never take counsel for a husband there be as much odds between my golden thought and his leaden advice as between his silver hair and my amber lock I know he will cough for anger that I yield not but he shall cough i a fool for his labour 

where pick your daughter that work out of broadstitch 

out of a flirt sampler but let we stay the end this be but the beginning you shall hear two child well bring up 

parent in these day be grow peevish they rock their child in their cradle till they sleep and cross they about their bridal till their heart ache marriage among they be become a market what will you give with your daughter what jointure will you make for your son and many a match be break off for a penny more or less as though they can not afford their child at such a price when none shall cheapen such ware but affection and none buy it but love 

learned and scholarlike 

in deed our parent take great care to make we ask blessing and say grace whenas we be little one and grow to year of judgement they deprive we of the great blessing and the most gracious thing to our mind the liberty of our mind they give we pap with a spoon before we can speak and when we speak for that we love pap with a hatchet because their fancy be grow musty with hoary age therefore nothing can relish in their thought that savour of sweet youth they study twenty year together to make we grow as straight as a wand and in the end by bow we make we as crooked as a cammock for my own part sweet Candius they shall pardon i for I will measure my love by min own judgement not my father purse or peevishness nature have make i his child not his slave I hare Memphio and his son deadly if I wit he will place his affection by his father appointment 

witty but uncivil 

be of that mind still my fair Livia let our father lay their purse together we our heart I will never woo where I can love let Stellio enjoy his daughter but what have you wrought here 

flower fowl beast fish tree plant stone and what not among flower cowslip and lily for our name Candius and Livia among fowl turtle and sparrow for our truth and desire among beast the fox and the ermine for beauty and policy and among fish the cockle and the tortoise because of Venus among tree the vine wreathe about the elm for our embrace among stone asbestos which be hot will never be cold for our constancy among plant time and heartsease to note that if we take time we shall ease our heart 

there be a girl that know her lerripoop 

listen and you shall hear my son learning 

what book be that 

a fine pleasant poet who entreat of the art of love and of the remedy 

be there art in love 

a short art and a certain three rule in 3 line 

I pray thou repeat they 

principio quod amare velis reperire labora proximus huic labour est placidam evor be puellam tertius ut longo tempore ducet amor 

I be no latinist Cand you must construe it 

so I will and pace it too thou shall be acquaint with case gender and number first one must find out a mistress who before all other he vow to serve second that he use all the mean that he may to obtain she and the last with desert faith and secrecy to study to keep she 

what be the remedy 

death 

what of all the book be the conclusion 

this one verse non caret essertu quod voluere dvo 

what be that 

where two be agree it be impossible but they must speed 

then can we miss therefore give i thy hand Candius 

soft Livia take i with you it be not good in law without witness 

and as I remember there must be two witness God give you joy Candius I be worth the bid to dinner though not worthy to be of the counsel 

I think this hot love have provide but cold cheer 

tush in love be no lack but blush not Candius you need not be ashamed of your cunning you have make love a book case and spend your time well at school learn to love by art and hate against nature but I perceive the worse child the better lover 

and my minion have wrought well where every stitch in her sampler be a prick stitch at my heart you take your pleasure on parent they be peevish fool churl overgrow with ignorance because overwear with age little shall thou know the case of a father before thyself be a mother when thou shall breed thy child with continual pain and bring it forth with deadly pang nurse it with thy own pap and nourish it up with motherly tenderness and then find they to curse thou with their heart when they shall ask blessing on their knee and the collop of thy own bowel to be the torture of thy own soul with tear trickle down thy check and drop of blood fall from thy heart thou will in utter of thy mind wish they rather unborn than unnatural and to have have their cradle their grave rather than thy death their bridal but I will not dispute what thou shall have do but correct what thou have do I perceive sow be a idle exercise and that every day there come more thought into thy head than stitch into thy work I will see whether you can spin a better mind than you have stitch and if I coop you not up then let i be the capon 

as for you sir boy in stead of pore on a book you shall hold the plough I will make repentance reap what wantonness have sow but we be both well serve the son must be master the father gaffer what we get together with a rake they cast abroad with a fork and we must weary our leg to purchase our child arm well see that book be but idleness I will see whether thresh be any occupation thy mind shall stoop to my fortune or i shall break the law of nature how like a micher he stand as though he have truant from honesty get thou in and for the rest let i alone in villain 

and you pretty minx that must be feed with love upon sop I will take a order to cram you with sorrow get you in without look or reply 

let we follow and deal as rigorous with you as I will with mine and you shall see that hot love will wax soon cold I will tame the proud boy and send he as far from his love as he be from his duty 

let we about it and also go on with match they to our mind it be happy that we prevent that by chance which we can never yet suspect by circumstance 

now if I can meet with Risio it be a world of waggery 

o that it be my chance obuiam dare Dromio to stumble upon Dromio on who I do nothing but dream 

his knavery and my wit shall make our master that be wise fool their child that be fool beggar and we two that be bond free 

he to cozen and I to conjure will make such alteration that our master shall serve themselves the idiot their child serve we and we to wake our wit between they all 

hem quàm opportune look if he drop not full in my dish 

Lupus in fabula Dromio embrace i hug i kiss my hand I must make thou fortunate 

Risio honour i kneel down to i kiss my foot I must make thou bless 

my master old Stellio have a fool to his daughter 

nay my master old Memphio have a fool to his son 

I must convey a contract 

and I must convey a contract 

between she and Memphio son without speak one to another 

between he and Stellio daughter without one speak to the other 

do thou mock i Dromio 

thou do i else 

not I for all this be true 

and all this 

then be we both drive to our wit end for if either of they have be wise we may have temper if no marriage yet a close marriage 

well let we sharpen our account there be no better grindstone for a young man head than to have it whet upon a old man purse o thou shall see my knavery shave like a razor 

thou for the edge and I the point will make the fool bestride our mistress back and then have at the bag with the dudgeon haft that be at the dudgeon dagger by which hang his tantonie pouch 

these old huddle have such strong purse with lock when they shut they they go off like a snaphance 

the old fashion be best a purse with a ring round about it as a circle to course a knave hand from it but Dromio two they say may keep counsel be one be away but to convey knavery two be too few and four too many 

and in good time look where halfpenny Sperantus boy come though bind up in decimo sexto for carriage yet a wit in folio for cozenage single halfpenny what news be now currant 

nothing but that such double coistrel as you be be counterfeit 

be you so dapper we will send you for a halfpenny loaf 

I shall go for silver though when you you shall be nail up for slip 

thou be a slipstring I will warrant 

I hope you shall never slip string but hang steady 

Dromio look here now be my hand on my halfpenny 

thou lie thou have not a farthing to lay thy hand on I be none of thou but let i be wag my head be full of hammer and they have so mallet my wit that I be almost a malcontent 

why what be the matter 

my master have a fine scholar to his son Prisius a fair lass to his daughter 

well 

they two love one another deadly 

in good time 

the feather have put they up utter dislike the match and have appoint the one shall have Memphio son the other Stellio daughter this work like wax but how it will fadge in the end the hen that sit next the cock can tell 

if thou have but any spice of knavery we will make thou happy 

tush doubt not of i I be as full for my pitch as you be for you a wren egg be as full of meat as a goose egg though there be not so much in it you shall find this head well stuff though there go little stuff to it 

laudo ingenium I like thy sconce then harken Memphio make i of his counsel about marriage of his son to Stellio daughter Stellio make Riscio acquaint to plot a match with Memphio son to be short they be both fool 

but they be not fool that be short if I think thou mean so senties qui vir sim thou shall have a crow to pull 

be not angry halfpenny for fellowship we will be all fool and for gain all knave but why do thou laugh 

at my own conceit and quick censure 

what be the matter 

sudden methinks you two be ass and that the least ass be the more ass 

thou be a fool that can be 

yea my young master teach i to prove it by learning and so I can out of Ovid by a verse 

prithee how 

you must first for fashion sake confess yourselves to be ass 

well 

then stand you here and you there 

go to 

then this be the verse as I point it cum mala per longas inualuêre moras so you see the least ass be the more ass 

we will bite thou for a ape if thou bob we like ass but to end all if thou will join with we we will make a match between the two fool for that must be our task and thou shall devise to couple Candius and Livia by overreach their father 

let i alone non enim mea pigra iwentus there be matter in this noddle 
but look where Prisius boy come as fit as a pudding for a dog mouth 

Pop three knave in a sheath I will make it a right Tunbridge case and be the bodkin 

nay the bodkin be here already you must be the knife 

I be the bodkin look well to your ear I must boar they 

Mew thy tongue or we will cut it out this I speak represent the person of a knife as thou do that in shadow of a bodkin 

I must begone taedet it irk oportet it behoove my wit work like barm alias yeast alias size alias rise alias god good 

the new wine be in thy head yet be he fain to take this metaphor from ale and now you talk of ale let we all to the wine 

four make a mess and we have a mess of master that must be cozen let we lay our head together they be marry and can 

let we consult at the tavern where after to the health of Memphio drink we to the life of Stellio I carouse to Prisius and brinch you master Sperantus we shall cast we our account and discharge our stomach like man that can digest any thing 

I see not yet what you go about 

Lucio that can pierce a mud wall of twenty foot thick will make we believe he can see a candle through a paper lantern his knavery be beyond Ela and yet he say he know not Gamut 

I be ready if any cozenage be ripe I will shake the tree 

nay I hope to see thou so strong to shake three tree at once 

we burn time for I must give a reckon of my day work let we close to the bush ad deliberandum 

in deed inter pocula philosophundum it be good to plea among pot 

thou will be the worst I fear we shall leave a halfpenny in hand 

why say thou that thou have leave a print deep in thy hand already than a halfpenny can leave unless it shall sing worse than a hot iron 

all friend and so let we sing it be a pleasant thing to go into the tavern clear the throat 

io Bacchus to thy table 
thou call every drunken 
rabble

I marvel I hear no news of Dromio either he slack the matter or betray his master I dare not motion any thing to Stellio till I know what my boy have do I will hunt he out if the loitersack be go spring into a tavern I will fetch he reel out 

without doubt Risio have go beyond himself in cast beyond the moon I fear the boy be run mad with study for I know he love i so well that for my favour he will venture to run out of his wit and it may be to quicken his invention he be go into this ivybush a notable nest for a grape owl I will ferret he out yet in the end use he friendly I can be merry till I hear what be do in the marriage 

I think Lucio be go a squirrel but I will squirrel he for it I send he on my errand but I must go for a answer myself I have tie up the love worm my daughter and will see whether fancy can worm fancy out of her head this green nosegay I fear my boy have smell to for if he get but a penny in his purse he turn it sudden into argentum potabile I must search every place for he for I stand on thorn till I hear what he have do 

well be as be may be no ban I think I have charm my young master a hungry meal a ragged coat and a dry cudgel have put he quite beside his love and his logic to beside his pigsney be put up and therefore now I will let he take the air and follow Stellio daughter with all his learning if he mean to be my heir the boy have wit sance measure more than needs cat meat and dog meat enough for the vantage well without halfpenny all my wit be not worth a dodkin that mite be miching in this grove for as long as his name be halfpenny he will be banquet for thither halfpenny 

he must needs go that the devil drive a father a fiend that seek to place affection by appointment and to force love by compulsion I have swear to woo Silena but it shall be so cold that she shall take as small delight in my word as I do contentment in his commandment I will teach he one school trick in love but behold who be that that come out of Stellio house it shall seem to be Silena by her attire enter Silena by her face I be sure it be she o fair face o lovely countenance how now Candius if thou begin to slip at beauty on a sudden thou will surfeit with carouse it at the last Remember that Livia be faithful ay and let thy eye witness Silena be amiable here shall I please my father and myself I will learn to be obedient and come what will I will make away if she seem coy I will practise all the art of love if I her cunning all the pleasure of love

the old time be a good time ale be a ancient drink and account of our ancestor authentical Gascon wine be liquor for a lord sack a medicine for the sick and I may tell you he that have a cup of red wine to his oyster be hoist in the queen subsidy book 

ay but now you see to what looseness this age be grow our boy carouse sack like double beer and say that which do a old man good can do a young man no harm old man say they eat pap why shall not child drink sack their white head have cozen time out of mind our young year 

well the world be wanton since I know it first our boy put as much now in their belly in a hour as will clothe their whole body in a year we have pay for their tipple eight shilling and as I have hear it be as much as buy Rufus sometime king of this land a pair of hose 

be it possible 

nay it be true they say ale be out of request it be hog porridge broth for beggar a caudle for constable watchman mouth glue the better it be the more like bird lime it be and never make one stay but in the stock 

I will teach my waghalter to know grape from barley 

and I i to discern a spigot from a faucet 

and I i to judge the difference between a black bowl and a silver goblet 

and i shall learn the odds between a stand and a hogshead yet I can choose but laugh to see how my wag answer i when I strike he for drink sack 

why what say he 

master it be the sovereign drink in the world and the safe for all time and weather if it thunder though all the ale and beer in the town turn it will be constant if it lighten and that any fire come to it it be the apt wine to burn and the most wholesome when it be burn so much for summer if it freeze why it be so hot in operation that no ice can congeal it if it rain why then he that can abide the heat of it may put in water so much for winter and so run his way but I will overtake he 

who will think that my hop on my thumb halfpenny scarce so high as a pint pot will reason the matter but he learn his leer of my son his young master who I have bring up at Oxford and I think must learn here in Kent at Ashford 

why what say he 

he bold rapt it out sine cere & baccho friget Venus without wine and sugar his vein will wax cold 

they be all in a pleasant vain but I must be go and take account of my boy business farewell neighbour God know when we shall meet again yet I have discover nothing my wine have be my wit friend I long to hear what Dromio have do 

I can stay but this good fellowship shall cost i the set on at our next meeting I be glad I blab nothing of the marriage now I hope to compass it I know my boy have be bungle about it 

let we all go for I must to my clothes that hang on the tenter my boy shall hang with they if he answer i not his day work 

if all be go I will not stay halfpenny I be sure have do i a penny worth of good else I will spend his body in buy a rod 

sweet sister I know not how it come to pass but I find in myself passion more than brotherly 

and I dear brother find my thought entangle with affection beyond nature which so flame into my distemper head that I can neither without danger smother the fire nor without modesty disclose my fury 

our parent be poor our love unnatural what can then happen to make we happy 

only to be content with our father mean estate to combat against our own intemperate desire and yield to the success of fortune who though she have frame we miserable can make we monstrous 

it be good counsel fair sister if the necessity of love can be relieve by counsel yet this be our comfort that these unnatural heat have stretch themselves no further than thought unhappy i that they shall stretch so 

that which nature warrant law forbid strange it seem in sense that because thou be i therefore thou must not be i 

so it be Serena the near we be in blood the further we must be from love and the great the kindred be the less the kindness must be so that between brother and sister superstition have make affection cold between stranger custom have breed love exquisite 

they say there be hard by a old cunning woman who can tell fortune expound dream tell of thing that be lose and divine of accident to come she be call the good woman who yet never do hurt 

nor any good I think Serena yet to satisfy thy mind we will see what she can say 

good brother let we 

who be within 

the dame of the house 

she may have say the beldame for her face and year and attire 

good mother tell we if by your cunning you can what shall become of my brother and i 

let i see your hand and look on i steadfast with your eye you shall be marry to morrow hand in hand by the law of good nature and the land your parent shall be glad and give you their land you shall each of you displace a fool and both together must relieve a fool if this be not true call i old fool 

this be my sister marry we can our parent be poor and have no land to give we each of we be a fool to come for counsel to such a old fool 

these doggerel rhyme and obscure word come out of the mouth of such a weatherbeaten witch be think divination of some holy spirit be but dream of decay brain for i own part I will thou may sit on that stool till he and I marry by law 

I say mother Bombie never speak but once and yet never speak untruth once 

Come brother let we to our poor home this be our comfort to bewray our passion since we can enjoy our love 

content sweet sister and learn of i hereafter that these old saw of such old hag be but false fire to lead one out of a plain path into a deep pit 

ingenium quondam fuerat pretiotius auro the time be wherein wit will work like wax and crock up gold like honey 

at nunc barbarie est grandis habere nihil but now wit and honesty buy nothing in the market 

what Risio how speed thou after thy pot 

nay my master ring all in the tavern and thrust all out in the house but how speed thou 

ay it be adays work to discourse it he speak nothing but sentence but they be vengible long one for when one word be out he make pause of a quarter long till he speak another 

why what do he in all that time 

break interjection like wind as eho ho to 

and what thou 

answer he in his own language as evax vah hui 

these be conjunction rather than interjection but what of the plot 

as we conclude I tell he that I understand that Silena be very wise and can sing exceed that my devise be see Accius his son a proper youth and can also sing sweet that he shall come in the nick when she be sing and answer she 

excellent 

then he ask how it shall be devise that she may come abroad I tell that be cast already by my mean than the song be end and they see one another note the apparel and mark the personage he shall call in his son for fear he shall overreach his speech 

very good 

then that I have get a young gentleman that resemble his son in year and favour that have Accius apparel shall court Silena who she find wise will after that by small entreaty be win without more word and so the marriage clap up by this cozenage and his son never speak word for himself 

thou boy so have I do in every point for the song the call she in and the hope that another shall woo Accius and his daughter wed he I tell he this woo shall be tonight and they early marry in the morning without any word save to say after the priest 

all this fadge well now if halfpenny and luceo have play their part we shall have excellent sport and here they come how wrought the wine my lad 

how like wine for my body be the roundlet and my mouth the vent it wrought two day over till I have think the hoop of my head will have fly asunder 

the best be our master be as well whittle as we for yet they lie by it 

the better for we we do but a little parboil our liver they have sod they in sack these forty year 

that make they spit white broth as they do but to the purpose Candius and Livia will send their attire you must send the apparel of Accius and Silena they wonder wherefore but commit the matter to our quadrapartite wit 

if you keep promise to marry they by your device and their parent consent you shall have ten pound a piece for your pain 

if we do it not we be undo for we have broach a cozenage already and my master have the tap in his hand that it must needs run out let they he rule and bring hither their apparel and we will determine the rest commit to our intricate consideration depart 

here come Accius tune his pipe I perceive my master keep touch 

and here come Silena with her wit of proof marry it will scarce hold out question shoot let we in to instruct our master in the que 

Come let we be jog but be not a world to hear they woe one another 

that shall be hereafter to make we sport but our master shall never know it 

o Cupid monarch over king 
wherefore have thou foot and wing 
it be to show how swift thou be 
when thou wound a tender heart 
thy wing be clip and foot hold still 
thy bow so many can not kill 

it be all one in Venus wanton school 
who high sit the wiseman or the fool

this be pat if the rest proceed Stellio be like to marry his daughter to a fool but a wreath be a wreath 

This frame to my wish Memphio be like to marry a fool to his son Accius tongue shall tie all Memphio land to Silena dowry let his father tooth undo they if he can but here I see Memphio I must seem kind for in kindness lie cozenage

in deed that be big enough to put thy honesty in but come shall we go about the matter 

now it be come to the pinch my heart pant 

I for my part be resolute in utranque paratus ready to die or to run away 

but hear i I be trouble with a vile dream and therefore it be little time spend to let mother Bombie expound it she be cunning in all thing 

then will I know my fortune 

and I will ask for a silver spoon which be lose last day which I must pay for 

and I will know what will become of our device 

and I 

then let we all go quick we must not sleep in this business our master be so watchful about it 

why do you rap so hard at the door 

because we will come in 

nay my house be no inn 

cross yourselves look how she look 

mark she not she will turn we all to ape 

what will you with i 

they say you be cunning and be call the good woman of Rochester 

if never to do harm be to do good I dare say I be not ill but what be the matter 

I have a ill dream and desire to know the signification 

dream my son have their weight though they be of a trouble mind yet be they sign of fortune say on 

in the dawn of the day for about that time by my start out of my sleep I find it to be methinks I see a stately piece of beef with a cape cloak of cabbage embroider with pepper have two honourable page with hat of mustard on their head himself in great pomp sit upon a cushion of white brewish line with brown bread methinks be powder he be much trouble with the salt rheum and therefore there stand by he two great flagon of sack and beer the one to dry up his rheum the other to quench his choler I as one envy his ambition hunger and thirst after his honour begin to pull his cushion from under he hope by that mean to give he a fall and with put out my hand awake and find nothing in all this dream about i but the salt rheum 

a dream for a butcher 

soft let i end it than I slumber again and methinks there come in a leg of mutton 

what all gross meat a rack have be dainty 

thou fool how can it come in unless it have be a leg methinks his hose be cut and draw out with parsley I thrust my hand into my pocket for a knife think to hox he and so awake 

belike thou go supperless to bed 

so I do every night but Sunday Prisius have a weak stomach and therefore we must starve 

well take this for answer though the dream be fantastical they that in the morning sleep dream of eat be in danger of sickness or of beat or shall hear of a wedding fresh a beat 

this may be true 

nay then let i come in with a dream short but sweet that my mouth water ever since I wake methinks there sit upon a shelf three damask prune in velvet cap and press satin gown like judge and that there be a whole handful of currant to be arraign of a riot because they cling together in such cluster twelve raisin of the sun be empanel in a jewry and as a leaf of whole maze which be bailiff be carry the quest to consult methinks there come a angry cook and geld the jewry of their stone and sweep both judge juror rebel and bailiff into a porridge pot whereat I be melancholy fetch a deep sigh that wake myself and my bed fellow 

this be devise not dream and the more foolish be no dream for that dream excuse the fantasticalness 

then ask my bedfellow you know he who dream that night that the king of diamond be sick 

but thy year and humour pretty child be subject to such fancy which the more unsensible they seem the more fantastical they be therefore this dream be easy to child this be give from the god to dream of milk fruit baby and rod they betoken nothing but that wantoness must have rod 

ten to one thy dream be true thou will be swinge 

nay gammer I pray you tell i who steal my spoon out of the buttery 

thy spoon be not steal but mislay thou be a ill huswife though a good maid look for thy spoon where thou have like to be no maid 

body of i let i fetch the spoon I remember the place 

soft swift the place if it be there now it will be there to morrow 

ay but perchance the spoon will not 

be thou once put to it 

no sir boy it be put to i 

How be it must 

I will warrant for want of a mist but what be my fortune mother 

thy father do live because he do die thou have spend all thy thrist with a die and so like a beggar thou shall die 

I will have like well if all the gerund have be there di do and dumb but all in die that be too deadly 

my father in deed be a dyer but I have be a dicer but to die a beggar give i leave not to believe mother Bombie and yet it may be I have nothing to live by but knavery and if the world grow honest welcome beggary but what have thou to say Risio 

nothing till I see whether all this be true that she have say 

I risio will fain see thou beg 

nay mother tell we this what be all our fortune we be about a matter of legerdemain how will it fadge 

you shall all thrive like cozener that be to be cozen by cozener all shall end well and you be find cozener 

gramercy mother Bombie we be all please if you be for your pain 

I take no money but good word rail not if I tell true if I do not revenge farewell Exit Bom 

now have we nothing to do but to go about this business Accius apparel let Candius put on and I will array Accius with Candius clothes 

here be Silena attire Lincio put it upon Livia and give i livia for Silena this do let Candius and Livia come forth and let Dromio and i alone for the rest 

what shall become of Accius and Silena 

tush their turn shall be next all must be do orderly let we to it for now it work 

this attire be very fit but how if this make i a fool and Silena wise you will then woo i and wed she 

thou know that Accius be also a fool and his raiment fit i so that if apparel be infectious I be also like to be a fool and he wit what will be the conclusion I marvel 

here come our counsellor 

Well say I perceive turtle fly in couple 

else how shall they couple 

so do knave go double else how shall they be so cunning in double 

Bona verba Livia 

I understand latin that be Livia be a good word 

no I bid her use good word 

and what deed 

none but a deed of gift 

what gift 

her heart 

give i leave to pose you though you be a graduate for I tell you we in Rochester spur so many hackney that we must needs spur scholar for we take they for hackney 

why so sir boy 

because I know two hire for ten groat a piece to say service on Sunday and that be not more than a posthorse from hence to Canterbury 

he know what he say for he once serve the postmaster 

in deed I think he serve some post to his master but come Dromio post i 

you say you will have her heart for a deed 

well 

if you take her heart for cor that heart in her body then know this molle eiuslevibus cor enim inuiolabile telis a woman heart be thrust through with a feather if you mean she shall give a heart name ceruus then be you worse for cornua ceruus habet that be to have one heart grow out at his head which will make one ache at the heart in their body 

I beshrew your heart I hear one come I know it be my father by his come 

what must we do 

why as I tell you and let i alone with the old man fall you to your bridal 

Come neighbour I perceive the love of our child wax key cold 

I think it be never but luke warm 

bavin will have their flash and youth their fancy the one as soon quench as the other burn but who be these 

here I do plight my faith take thou for the staff of my age and of my youth my solace 

and I vow to thou affection which nothing can dissolve neither the length of time nor malice of fortune not distance of place 

but when shall we be marry 

a good question for that one delay in wedding bring a hundred danger in the church we will not be ask and a licence be too chargeable and to tarry till tomorrow too tedious 

there be a girl stand on prick till she be marry 

to avoid danger charge and tediousness let we now conclude it in the next church 

agree 

what be these that hasten so to marry 

marry sir Accius son to Memphio and Silena Stellio daughter 

I be sorry neighbour for our purpose be disappoint

by this time I be sure the wag have play their part there rest nothing now for we but to match Accius and Silena 

it be too good to be true for we shall laugh hearty and without laugh my spleen will split but whist here come the man enter Accius and yonder the maid let we stand aside 

what mean my father to thrust i forth in another boy coat I will warrant it be to as much purpose as a hem in the forehead

then be he as good as ever he be I will warrant he will do nothing but lie down 

I lend he thou gentle 

and I restore he so gentle that he neither will cry wyhie nor wag the tail 

but why do thou boar he through the ear 

it may be he be set on the pillory because he have not a true pace 

no it be for tire 

he will never tire it may be he will be so weary he will go no further or so

nay stay let he be bail 

so he shall when I make he a wreath 

it be a very good horse I must needs confess and now hearken to his quality and have patience to hear they since I must pay for he he will stumble three hour in one mile I have think I have ride upon addeces between this and Canterbury if one give he water why he will lie down and bathe himself like a hawk if one run he he will simper and mump as though he have go woo to a malt mare at Rochester he trot before and amble behind and be so obedient that he will do duty every minute on his knee as though every stone have be his father 

I be sure he have no disease 

a little rheum or pose he lack nothing but a handkerchief 

Come what a tale of a horse have we here I can not stay thou must with i to prison

every fox to his hole the hound be at hand 

the sergeant maze lie at pawn for the reckon and he under the board to cast it up 

the scrivener can keep his pen out of the pot every goblet be a inkhorn 

the hackneyman he whisk with his wand as if the tavern be his stable and all the servant his horse lose there up bay Richard and white loaf be horsebread in his eye

you give your consent 

impudent giglot be it not enough to abuse i but also to belie i 

you sir agree to this match 

thou brazen face boy think thou by learning to persuade i to that which thou speak where do I consent when what witness 

in this place yesterday before Dromio and Risio 

I remember we hear a contract between Memphio son and Stellio daughter and that our good will be ask which need not we give they which boot not 

it be but the apparel of Accius and Silena we be the person 

o villainy not to be bear be thou privy to this practice 

in a manner 

I will pay thou after a manner 

and you oatmeal groat you be acquaint with this plot 

accessary as it be 

thou shall be punish as principal here come Memphio and Stellio they belike be privy and all their head be lay together to grieve our heart 

Come Stellio the assurance may be make tomorrow and our child assure today 

let the conveyance run as we agree 

you convey clean in deed if cozenage be clean deal for in the apparel of your child you have convey a match between we which grieve we not a little 

nay in the apparel of your child you have discover the folly of we which shame we overmuch 

but it be no matter though they be fool they be no beggar 

and though we be disobedient they be no fool 

so now they tune their pipe 

you shall hear sweet music between a hoarse raven and a screech owl 

neighbour let we not vary our boy have play their cheat part I suspect no less at the tavern where four four knave meet together

I will take the tale by the end then we four meet which argue we be no mountain and in a tavern we meet which argue we be mortal and every one in his wine tell his day work which be a sign we forget not our business and see all our master trouble with devise we determine a little to trouble the water before they drink so that in the attire of your child our master wise child bewray their good nature and in the garment of our master child you make a marriage this all stand upon we poor child and your young child to show that old folk may be overtake by child 

here be a child in deed I will never forget it 

I will Accius come forth 

I forgive all Silena come forth 

neighbour these thing can be recall therefore as good consent see in all our purpose also we miss the mark for they two will match their child

Come Accius thou must be marry to Silena how be thou mind

harken about eighteen year ago I must thou a son Memphio and thou a daughter Stellio

what monstrous tale be this 

and I be sure incredible 

let she end her discourse 

I will never believe it 

hold thy peace 

my very bowel earn within i that I shall be author of such vild incest a hindrance to lawful love I go to the good old woman mother Bombie to know the event of this practice who tell i this day I may prevent the danger and upon submission escape the punishment hither I be come to claim my child though both fool and to deliver you both love 

be this possible how shall we believe it 

I can sink into my head 

this trial can fail your son Memphio have a mole under his care I frame one under my child care by art you shall see it take away with the juice of mandrake behold now for your son no herb can undo that nature have do your daughter Stellio have on her wrist a mole which I counterfeit on my daughter arm and that shall you see take away as the other thus you see I do not dissemble hope you will pardon i as I have pity they
