that title relish flattery for aught you know I may be vicious 

goodness delude itself then 
I can flatter lady you mistake i 
what I shall speak come from a innocence 
yet undefiled by falsehood 

speak quick if it concern i otherwise I must 
entreat a licence to depart 

you can afford example of such cruelty 
to follow lover to deprive my sight so soon 
of you for who least view the dark cimmerian blind 
with continual sleep will rouse his heavy eyelid 

nay and you begin to run a compliment out of breath 
you will drive i hence indeed believe i sir have I not like 
you well my modesty will scarce have suffer the least 
interchange of word but since it have do pray be brief 
what tend your conference to 

I love you lady 
with the religious fancy that one saint 
affect another such a heat as i 
be that with which the first whoever know love 
have their soul warm essential not as now 
the common garb be to adore a lip 
or any other lineament but for 
the abstract of perfection which do glory 
in be derive from one so good as you be 
be I become your captive 

This to i sound as the empty whistle of the air 
do in some hollow vault unspotted truth 
inform my ignorance there be not a person 
in all the multitude of man love chaste 

be so charitable 
as to believe I can who never yet 
know flame be vicious my desire retain 
their maiden purity no other object 
do ere attract my soul unblinded eye but your fair self 

then I believe you sir 
no man will be so worthless to dissemble 
with i who can think but all the world 
intend the same reality that I do 
yet it be a error which persuasion scarce 
shall free i from that every woman ought 
to love a man with that indifferent heat 
she fancy other woman without sense 
of difference betwixt the sex 

soul of sweetness 
how equal a angel intellect 
inform her sacred reason to love chaste 
can not have be define with just strictness 
have we produce the constancy of swan 
or never change turtle as our pattern 
it have but describe chaste love the palm that prosper 
not but by his fellow and the vine that weave 
of her own leaf a thin yet glorious mantle 
for her naked lover do but emblem what 
her truth have utter but resolve i fair one 
can you affect so 

if that be all 
requisite to love I can but there be obedience 
a nuptial wreath bring with it which I fear 
my frailty will scarce keep and to become 
perfidious to a vow be such a sin 
as I shall quake to think of 

you allege 
vain difficulty I perceive your look 
will be propitious to i do your will 
ashamed perhaps to suffer sudden conquest 
not play the tyrant with they and call back 
the crimson nectar from your wellformed cheek 
to guard your heart from yield come let we kiss 
the modest heat proceed from my lip 
will thaw your soul to softness 

away we may not 
if true chaste love have rest in discourse 
I can have be its votary but a thought 
of any thing beyond it be to i 
dangerous as sickness farewell sir 

sure some white cherubin 
come to teach the irreligious earth 
the ancient truth in its swift flight to heaven 
pronounce that happy farewell to the soul 
its music have convert I have not lose 
in my first trial like some venturous man 
who find the Indies though he get small wealth 
yet he set forth again in hope at last 
to lade his wing vessel I will return 
that fire be not out which do in ash burn 

so now it work the operation I believe be not on the sudden and my wound rankle as fast as if he have run his rapier through a head of garlic or wash it in aqua fortis and this weapon salve so much extol by the Twibill knight commend by mixum deify by urinal and adore by my believe self procure no more miraculous effect than if it be unguentum album well I be confident yet there be no defect in the unguent my blood my blood be sure anathemate carry some curse impediment about it that disannul the virtue and incomparable force of the divine salve this dutch blood of i guilty of bacon grease and potted butter soft who be these my cousin fortress general of the Twibill knight and his assistant pirke with mr mixum it be a detriment to valour to complain before they

but cousin it be necessary you enroll yourself into the family before you wed our order like the knight of Malta do admit no person espouse but with this difference if they receive the order bachelor they may then marry and yet retain the title 

say you so cousin

how perdition captain how dare you meet without i or conceit that decree valuable which the voice of captain Pirke have not assent to refuse i sir the brethren of the blade shall i their bold confrontment vengeance do you take i for a boy or some pigwiggin consult without i

attend then cousin sconce our order I will assure you be such as the most envious justice nor their goosequill clark that smell at new Bridewell and Finsbury shall not exclaim on imprimis it be general decree 

how general without i fire of Styx this be insufferable 

good captain pirke on cousin fortress 

that no knight of the twibill as whiskin or ally gentleman shall presume to lead or convey any of the sister of the order viz Striker cockatrice or gynimeg through the watch after twelve unless he see they asleep or be in see with the constable under the penalty of be send to the house of correction 

renounce i sir this order I will not sign to it savour of cowardice fear to convey a sister through the watch it be against our noble institution 

next it be enact that none of the groom of our wardrobe shall offer to deprive any man of cloak coat or hat unless it be in the dark as they fear to answer it at the next assize and be burn in the hand for it 

it will be a hot touch for they cousin fortress 

next it be decree that the receiver of our rent and custom to wit diverse rook and saint Nicholas clerk shall certain use no more slight to get more than they can clear come off with under penalty of be carry up Holborn in a cart and at Tyburn execute which may tend to the dissolution of our whole fraternity 

but have you conclude nothing for the sister I long to hear they

you will not have they like the Jew at Rome wear party colour garment to be know from Christian 

by no mean sir we will have every one take notice of they but marshal man beadle and constable and therefore have ordain that they shall wear beaver hat poke russes grogram gown or at the best wrought taffeta fox skin muff mohair petticoat bodkin and crosscloth edge with gold lace 

this be the habit of our rotterdamian 

the only shape to hide a striker in ever while you 
live your city be most secure from officer and most 
notorious to gentleman they will take up your city wear at 
any rate beside while they slant it in plush

knight great master of the order of Twibill lord of no 
cloak viscount Ratan cane and one spur

count frieze grey feel and moneylack duke of Turnbull Bloomesbury and rot row lord paramount of all gardenalley gun alley and rosemary lane 

he have more title than the great turk proceed sir 

chief commander of all Twibill dangerfield and whiskin who will quarrel in tavern with a man and not fight in the field with a mouse and of the residue of the fraternity of huff diverse dam and decoy sole sultan and grand signeur have to the premise set my mighty hand together with hand of our trusty and our courageous assistant this blank be for you captain pike Holofernes makeshift Rosiran Knockdowne and twenty six more of our principal companion of the order 

nay there be other too bury not their appellation in oblivion they merit memory 

to which at our command also be subsign our most illustrious and remarkable sister they be slit nose perhaps there be a touch for they cousin fortress donna Jsabella Garreta mother of the maid of Lambeth marsh with her conspicuous consort at the three skip coney in the town a touch that you mean the three squirrel you be cunning cousin fortress together with our most industrious servant Pythagoras pig 

I give he that name from his transmigration into cast suit who have put his petty toe to it and final the woman that sing ballad have her name trundle at the tail of it 

I marvel master doctor have not set his hand to this 

seal with the seal at arm of our order viz three rook volant in a field sanguine two break jug the supporter and a twibill for the crest and give the second day of this present month at our mansion royal or place of meeting in the long graveled walk in our usual field 

well master doctor you will remember i 
and have a eye unto my nephew I trust 
she with you farewell sir

society entreat they to prepare again tomorrow for 
my cousin sconce enfeoffment 

upon compulsion sir I shall refuse marry on fair entreaty I do fly good and high fate look on you 

son sconce I be bold to call you so how do your at i 

indifferent sir but yet I have not find 
that rare effect in the weapon salve you speak of 
urinal I fear since it cure the two sergeant and their 
yeoman the virtue have be much extenuate 

it be your ill dress the weapon give i your sword son this be of the right salve the welsh doctor make this shall save my credit anoint the weapon now urinal take this weapon lap it warm in linen clothes and lock it in my son your anguish son will soon be mitigate 

I have a touch of it already sir 

I have see experience of this weapon salve and by its most mysterious work know some man hurt past the help of surgery recover 

mark you that master sconce the gentleman may be believe 

yet I can 
with my laborious industry invent 
a reason why it shall do this and therefore 
transcend natural cause I conclude 
the use unlawful 

he be unlawful beget sir dare term it so there be a touch for he cousin fortress I call he son of a whore and he will take no notice of it 

but pray sir why shall it be unlawful 

cause conscience and religion disallow 
in the recovery of our impair health 
the assistance of a medicine make by charm 
or subtle spell of witchcraft 

his mother be a witch say this maid so there be another touch for he cousin fortress son of a witch but he understand not that neither 

conceive you this to be compound so 

I will prove it master doctor 

the proof of a pudding be the eat in your tooth sir a pudding in his tooth you know what I mean cousin fortress another touch for he but all be one he have wit in his anger and will not understand i 

if he dare blunder for it cousin sconce 

yet to avoid a tedious argument 
since our contention vbz only for discourse 
and to instruct my knowledge pray tell i 
a I you not that this same salve will cure 
at any distance as if the person hurt 
shall be at York the weapon dress at London 
on which his blood be 

all this be grant it will 

nay we will grant you more sir that it will not and yet prove it and you shall prove yourself a so you shall there have be another touch for he cousin fortress but I fear he will have understand i now ere you shall prove it 

silence cousin sconce let we hear the whiffler if he can verify his word sink i my Jo he shall taste arm of dangerfield 

out of your word sir I will prove it diabolical no cause 
natural beget the most contemn effect 
without a passage through the mean the fire 
can produce another fire until 
it be apply to subject apt to take 
its flame form nor can a natural cause 
work at incompetent space how then can this 
neither consign to the matter upon which 
its operation be to cause effect 
nay at so far a distance work so great 
and admirable a cure beyond the reach 
and law of nature yet by you maintain 
a natural lawful agent what dull sense can credit it 

very authentic this well if the devil have take the pain to be my surgeon my arm I fear will be possess I feel a evil spirit in it already 

respect the doctor answer 

sir you speak reason I must confess but every cause 
work not the same way we distinguish thus 
some by a physical and real touch 
produce so carver hew the rough marble 
frame a well polish statue but there be 
a virtual contact too which other cause 
employ in act their more rare effect 
so the bright sun do in the solid earth 
by the infusive virtue of his ray 
convert the for do substance of the mould 
to mine of mettle and the pierce air 
by cold reflection so engender ice 
and yet you can say the chilly hand 
of air or quicken finger of the sun 
real touch the water or the earth 
the loadstone so by operative force 
cause the iron which have feel his touch 
to attract another iron nay the needle 
of the ship guide compass to respect 
the cold pole Arctic just so the salve work 
certain hide cause convey its powerful 
virtue to the wound from the anoint 
weapon and reduce it to welcome soundness 

the salve be legitimate again cousin fortress oh rare doctor 

nay you shall hear he tickle the gentleman I warrant you 

This mr doctor be 
a weak evasion and your purity 
have small affinity the glorious sun 
as it be a general instrument of heaven 
in all its great production and the air 
a elemental agent natural 
engender metal in the earth and ice 
on the self frizzle water the loadstone 
as it be a simple body may afford 
that virtue to the steel by secret power 
of allcommanding nature but that this 
this weapon salve a compound shall affect 
more than the pure body can by way 
more wonderful than they do as apply 
unto a sword a body void of life 
yet it must give life or at least preserve it 

pish he talk like a apothecary to the doctor 

you mistake it do not 
it be the blood stick to the sword achieve 
the cure there be a real sympathy 
betwixt it and that which have the juice of life 
moisten the body wound 

rare Paracelsian thy annal shall be cut in brass by 
pen of steel 

you may as well 
report a real sympathy between 
the nimble soul in its swift flight to heaven 
and the cold carcase it have late leave 
as a loathe habitation blood when like 
the sap of tree which weep upon the axe 
who cruel edge do from the age trunk 
dissever the green branch from the vein 
ravish forego his native heat and have 
no more relation to the rest than some 
desertless servant who his lord cast off 
have to his virtuous fellow 

mr freewit return again and in discourse 
with mr doctor I will not disturb your conference 

so please your ladyship we have even do 
I be glad she be come to rescue i 

there be a touch for he cousin fortress victus victa victum he look like a schoolboy vanquish at cap verse hark you sir repent your error and in time you may be save you see the virtue of the salve the doctor have dress his speak weapon with it it hurt you and it have cure you beware you fall not into a relapse there be another touch for he cousin 

doctor give your hand father I shall have say some fame historian some gallobelgicus shall chronicle thou and thy salve there be a touch for he cousin fortress come you shall see my mistress 

mr Freewit have you yet find the injure 
woman out I motion at last part 

true mistress have she be worthy the seek your 
command shall not have be protract but 
it be a stain to my own honour to be inquisitive 
after a prostitute and a blot to your 
discretion shall nice judgement know you enjoin i 
so manifest a folly 

it be a great to be the author of her shame 
who now you slight so infinite 

can I slight she more 
it be a due justice which I owe myself 
in hazard the forfeit of your love 
undo by she but your most serious thought 
will sure convert your soul from the intent 
of my most certain ruin which your last 
discourse perhaps for trial of my faith 
seem to invert upon i 

you mistake needless be second trial when a first 
prove you perfidious doubtless you confirm 
your love to she with the same sad protest 
you have do to i yet leave she for her sake 
and in revenge of woman innocence martyr by you 
I here to heaven pronounce a sure disjunction 
of our love and vow for ever 

o reserve that breath 
which ought like sacred incense to be spend 
only on heaven or in deliver note 
may charm the world to peace when rage war 
or earth quake have affright it confirm 
on no such use horrid and ominous 
as if it threaten thunder to the earth 
or will infect the genius of the air 
with mist contagious as if compose 
of viper steam oh have you be wont 
to be so good that virtue will have sigh 
at the unwelcome spectacle if you 
have appear woman in a passion 
though of the slight consequence oh do not 
renounce that saintlike temper it will be 
a change hereafter burdenous to your soul 
as sin to one who all his life time bless 
with peace of conscience at his die minute 
fall into mortal enmity with heaven 
and perish eternal 

these word 
have not the effectual oratory you first have 
when I be confident as day of light 
your youth have be as destitute of vice 
as of deformity So a sweet stream 
who bubble harmony allure the bird 
to court its move music when it mix 
with impure water with the noise affright 
the ear before delight in it 

this be too severe a justice and extend 
to cruelty have some intemperate rage 
purple my hand in murder though the guilt 
will have be write in a large text 
in conscience black book yet the punishment 
have not be half so hideous I shall for that 
have suffer but a temporary pain 
at worst and my true repentant soul 
perhaps have have free entrance to the place 
consign to penitent when now like so i 
manacle captive or disease wretch 
on who each minute do beget a death 
I like a slow fire by my own soft flame 
with tortoise speed extinguish 

sir your word be superficial as a shadow which 
the morning sun produce and black night 
render forget and no more excite 
belief in i that what you utter be truth 
then man rake groan do a conceit of death 
in person resolute while I have yet 
a specious memory leave that once my heart 
tender you dear I will counsel you 
first to endeavour to find out that maid 
if that succeed not not to think on i 
as one affiance to you by a near interest than other woman 
be that never have conversation with you 

have a frost sharp as a tedious winter northern blast 
congeal your mercy my unfeigned tear 
shall with moist warmth dissolve it mistress you 
approach so near the attribute of heaven 
that have you live in the superstitious age 
more precious gum have fume upon your altar 
then on all female deity o forgive i 
a rigorous tyrant breath will scarce pronounce 
for one and the first crime so strict a sentence 
you shall not go yet if you will recall it 
lover will bless your piety and sub scribe to your 
superlative goodness 

pray desist afford i liberty to retire I can alter my resolution 

yet reclaim it some devil spleen have late fraught 
your breast and banish thence mild the pity boisterous wind 
force so the gentle and untroubled sea 
to swallow up some ship its natural calmness 
will have transport safe with their wealth 
to their desire harbour be my thought 
not fix with that religion upon you 
that be my prayer when I repent on heaven 
I shall not thus transcend the law and strength 
of manhood and like some distress babe 
leave by its parent to the desolate wood 
or air cold charity so long implore 
a new and holy union betwixt our soul 
then ere have link they which when you have tie 
time shall depend like summer on your brow 
and your whole life be one continue youth 
such be the spring in paradise and when

my proper attribute 

can there be on earth 
a savageness so great as will conspire 
to afflict so rich a goodness yet by your eye 
adorn by those clear pearl which do transform 
even sorrow to a loveliness beyond 
indifferent beauty I conceive some fiend 
rest in humane shape for man will never 
have dare so vile a sacrilege in hope 
by your pure tear to extinguish his own flame 
cause this distemper in you 

pish you be long to speed be 
short and quick that please lady 

I have a young brother though not full bless 
in your sweet knowledge yet once his tongue 
be his heart bold ambassador and deliver 
a true narration of his zealous love 
which be in he so permanent that when 
his ear receive a notice that your faith 
be plight to another it will be juice 
of baleful hemlock to his brain convert it 
either to sudden madness or asleep cold and everlasting 

I remember once a nephew of sir Martin do solicit 
that which he term my love but I conceive 
his meaning rather be to cause discourse 
then that his strict intention have resolve 
his promise performance 

do I not tell you she will come about 

trust i lady the solitary nightingale who sing 
to her lose honour a harmonious ditty 
love not the thorn so dear to who prick

may soon be obscure by wander smoke 
nay the eternal essence of the soul 
become corporeal and revisit earth 
after its flight to paradise ere he 
descend to variation of his love can you affect he 

have your brother be 
of the same disposition and soft sweetness 
that I perceive in you though this be our 
first interview there can not have be mould

a man that will so fit sympathize 
with my condition nor who I shall fancy 
with more entire perfection 

strike home and sure the iron vbz hot already 

behold he lady 
who every motion do as from the sphere 
receive a lively influence from your look 
the modest silence of the temperate even 
when Zephir soft murmur to the flower 
a wholesome farewell undisturbed by storm 
may soon rest in one continue night 
then can my soul in quiet without just 
assurance of your love which if you grant 
time native bellman the shield organed cock 
shall cease to carol matin to the morn 
the early lark that whisper to the sun 
a constant augury of a beauteous day 
shall lose his light plume in the checker cloud 
ere I my resolute chastity nor can you 
invent evasion to declare my suit 
since on its grant rely the only hope 
of your redemption from the barbarous arm 
of he you be espouse to 

This surprise 
and your strong vow will batter a resolve 
down in a breast that can be flexible 
to easy love but since I can frame 
my conscience to a warrantable zeal 
towards any man I will rather fix my hate 
for that must of necessity accrue 
to he that wed i on a person worthy 
contempt then on yourself who worth do challenge 
a noble and reciprocal regard 
for your affection blessing on you sir think not amiss of i
