that give those blessing which I must relate 
sir you now behold a wondrous woman 
you only wonder at the epithet 
I can approve it good guess at my age 

at the half way betwixt thirty and forty 

it be not much amiss yet near to the last 
how think you then be not this a wonder 
that a woman live full seven and thirty year 
maid to a wife and wife unto a widow 
now widow and my own yet all this while 
from the extreme verge of my remembrance 
even from my wean hour unto this minute 
do never taste what be calamity 
I know not yet what grief be yet have seek 
a hundred way for its acquaintance with i 
prosperity have keep so close a watch 
that even those thing that I have mean 
a cross have that way turn a blessing 
be it not strange 

unparalleled this gift be singular 
and to you alone belong you be the moon 
for there be but one all woman else be star 
for there be none of like condition 
full oft and many have I hear complain 
of discontent thwart and adversity 
but a second to yourself I never know 
to groan under the superflux of blessing 
to have ever be a lien unto sorrow 
no trip of fate sure it be wonderful 

ay sir it be wonderful but be it well 
for it be now my chief affliction 
I have hear you say that the child of heaven 
shall suffer many tribulation 
nay king and prince share they with their subject 
then I that know not any chastisement 
how may I know my part of childhood 

it be a good doubt but make it not extreme 
it be some affliction that you be afflict 
for want of affliction cherish that 
yet wrest it not to misconstruction 
for all your blessing be free gift from heaven 
health wealth and peace nor can they turn to 
curse but by abuse pray let i question you 
you lose a husband be it no grief to you 

it be but very small no soon I 
have give it entertainment as a sorrow 
but straight it turn unto my treble joy 
a comfortable revelation prompt i then 
that husband who in life I hold so dear 
have change a frailty to unchanging joy 
methinks I see he stellify in heaven 
and sing hallelujah among a choir 
of white saint soul then again it speak 
and say it be a sin for i to grieve 
at his best good that I esteem best 
and thus this slender shadow of a grief 
vanish again 

all this be happy nor can you wrest it 
from a heavenly blessing do not appoint 
the rod leave still the stroke unto the 
magistrate the time be not past but 
you may feel enough 

one taste more I have although but little 
yet I will aggravate to make the most 
on it thus it be the other day it be my hap 
in cross of the Thames 
to drop that wedlock ring from off my finger 
that once conjoin i and my dead husband 
it sink I prise it dear the dear because it keep 
still in my eye the memory of my loss 
yet I grieve the loss and do joy withal 
that I have find a grief and this be all 
the sorrow I can boast of 

this be but small
