with spear and sword so thick point on he 
that nothing but his sacred valour can 
give light for a supply to his relief 
which shine so through and through his wall of foe 
as a rich diamond amongst a heap of ruin 
and so be find by the quick eye of Sforza 
when like a deity arm with wrath and thunder 
he cut a path of horror through the battle 
rain down blood about he as he fly 
like a prodigious cloud of pitch and fire 
until he pierce into the straight wherein 
the royal person of our king be at 
his last bare stake of one life to a thousand 

I dare not hear it yet

I ply she then with pill that puff she up 
to a high longing till she see the hope

have the king kiss move by adulterate heat 
swell you into a stubborn loathsomeness 
of wholesome counsel come your way I will try 
if countryair and diet can restore you

thou sensible of shame I will afford thou 
do thou not after banquet when the king 
heat with wine and lust raise in his eye 
have kiss thou once twice thrice though I look on

I be his highness prisoner and more 
though I know not my crime unless it be 
my due obedience I be still so far 
from grudge at his pleasure as I fear 
to ask you what it be suppose to be 
but rather wait the event which though it bring 
my death it be welcome from my lord and king 

be ever virtue more abuse than she 

yet thus much good my lord without offence 
let i demand be Sforza still close prisoner 

yes and Petruccio his adversary 
govern his place and high in the king favour 

I will not ask his trespass neither it 
suffice it be the king high pleasure but Alinda 
Sforza fair daughter what become of she 
poor virtuous maid be she throw out of favour 
because I love she too 

alas good queen 

what do you weep nay then all be not well 
with she I fear 

good queen I fear so too 
and that all ill proceed from she to you 

I may not understand thou Lodovico 
I will still retain the duty of a wife 
which though it be reject shall not throw 
i from the path a subject ought to go 

two such wife more may save a nation 
but see Petruccio the nowpowerful man under the king 

Horatio with he too be they such friend 

none great since the king be please to grace Petruccio 

madam however my person no less than my authority I know be most unwelcome to you I must appear and lay the king command upon you which you must obey 

I must see Lodovico here be a plain 
deal lord that know my love and my 
obedience to the king and warn i 
faithful to observe it good my lord 
I will obey the king command in you 
lay it on i what must I do 

you must go to the bar to answer to 
those accusation that will be bring 
against your life and honour as touch 
your foul disloyalty unto the king 

he be a traitor to the king and i 
that dare accuse i of disloyalty 
patience assist i and control my passion 
the great crime that ever I commit 
against my sovereign be to be so near 
the vice of anger in the presence of 
one that he love so well but pray your pardon 
though true those sharppointed word draw blood 
from my oppress heart and though you love i not 
I hope you think i innocent 

will I can

my lord you ever love i can you think 

Come what I think I think my love to you 
be the king love if it be love at all 
if he will say he ever love you I can say so too 
but to speak truth I know not if I do 
or I do not but now you be hateful to i 
that I dare speak because he hate you sound 
and your old russian Sforza that fell traitor 
that will have kill the king do you look up at it 
you may look down with sorrow enough 
your countryman your brave old champion 
he have champion you sweet it seem 
be there no honest woman 

what mean this unknown language 

woman be always ignorant of reproof 
I will tell you what it mean for that love sake 
you think I love you once or do you know 
what mar and Venus mean when injure Vulcan 
have they in his net good king how be thou abuse 
and this good honest faithful loyal lord 
full to the brim of merit and true valour 
by that bladebrandishing Sforza that mere fencer 
to this great martialist but he be fast enough 
and all be come out however you will answer it 

what must I answer I know not yet your meaning 

nor ever shall for i 

you will know too much 
I fear anon Come madam will you go 
the highcourt stay your come 

I must submit i to it and its law 
but to a high judge refer my cause 

good queen thy wrong be manifest though none 
must dare to utter they but in our moon 

mount mount my thought above the earthy 
of vassal mind while strength of woman wit pitch 
prop my ambition up and lift my hope 
above the flight of envy let the base 
and abject mind be please with servile bondage 
my breast breed not a thought that shall not fly 
the lofty height of tower majesty 
my power upon the weakness of the king 
who rage dotage to obtain my love 
like a devour flame seek to consume 
all interpose let we have lay a groundwork 
so sure upon those ruin that the power 
of fate shall not control or stop my build 
up to the top of sovereignty where I will stand 
and dare the world to discommend my act 
it shall but say when I the crown have win 
the work be harsh in do but well do 
flavello welcome 

hail my sovereign queen 

it be a brave sound and that which my soul thirst for 
but do not mock my ear 

believe it madam 
join your attention but with one hour patience 
and you shall hear the general voice of the kingdom 
give you that style with large and loud allowance 

style thyself happy then in what reward 
a subject can receive or a queen give 
how move our great proceed 

fair thus 
Eulalia for now I must no more 
give she the title that belong unto 
your excellence of queen 

Advance that harmony 

Eulalia be bring unto the bar accuse 
convict of that high offence that instant 
shall pull that judgement on she that shall crush 
she into nothing 

appear the proof manifest 

that be my care it behoove i to work the witness who swear in brief most brave that they hear lord Sforza who you also may forget now to call father 

that without your instruction 

they swear I say they hear that Sforza boast 
the knowledge of the queen in carnal lust 

be that enough 

no but it serve to put 
the question to she be it true or not 
no cry the queen nor can I think that Sforza 
will lay that scandal on himself and i 
those witness be two cashier lieutenant 
that Sforza shall have hang for mutiny 
in the late war but throw they by it seem 
to serve he in this office i they cost 
five hundred crown apiece and well they get it 
but where I leave the queen deny their oath 
and though it have be true that Sforza have 
affirm as much that have not find her guilty 

what witness be next 

two dainty devil 
bird a doctor and a midwife who accuse 
themselves for bawd in the action and depose 
I know not how many how many how many time 
they see they link in their unlawful pleasure 
these be the queen own people and deserve 
a thousand crown apiece and have it instant 
aforehand too 

what can the queen say then 

she deny all but in such a patient way 
after her foolish fashion that it give strength 
to the evidence against she than she weep 
for their iniquity and give they a god forgive you 
and so attend the censure of the court 
which straightway will be give they will be set 
before my come 

have flavello haste 
and let thy next news be to this a crown 
that she be not a queen and I be one 
this father and this queen I now can pity 
for be hew out and square thus to my use 
but that they make those necessary step 
by which I must ascend to my ambition 
they that will rise unto a supreme head 
shall not regard upon who neck they tread 

my lord and loyal peer 

a new distinction 
between spiritual and temporal 

good Lodovico peace 

this be a cause the which but for fair order 
by which I be constrain to be a judge 
will rather drive i to a mourn closet 
then to this seat to show my equal grief 
against the crime and shame of the delinquent 
I see you be all amaze and can marvel 
at your astonishment who do suffer with you 
in the great change honour compel i to 
together with religion fair urge 
to a high point of justice which to utter 
draw faintness from my word chill my blood 
like the depart breath that separate life 
for such I hold she and so many year 
retain she in the closet of my heart 
its selfcompanion that till these proof 
which now like dagger by compulsive wound 
have make their passage she can never have part 

royal hypocrisy 

the proof you see be plain 
that she be find pray speak it for i 

in adultery 

and that she seek the life of fair Alinda 
by sword and poison both and of that cup 
it be like myself have taste 
for my suppose love to that wrong lady 

you have give she the bedright that belong to your wrong queen these twelve month 

our law of Sicily be so well rebate 
with clemency and mercy that in this case 
they cut not life from one of royal blood 
only take off as be on she perform 
all dignity all title all possession 
all mean to live even to her naked hand 
and such Eulalia now be your condition 

to work for her live if she be as young and no honest than she for who sake this be inflict on she she may find something else about she then naked hand to help at a live shift 

now to this censure for due order sake 
and for which end this parliament be call 
your voice be require do you all approve it 

we do 

we must 

what say you Lodovico 

we do heaven know against my heart 

my thank unto you all that do obey 
so well with one consent your sovereign lord 
and sacred sir thus low as it become i 
let your poor handmaid beg that you incline 
a patient ear to this my last petition 
that as you cast i off as a offence 
you will be please to think i not offend 
but please in all I suffer for heaven know

unto that accusation guilty or not guilty 

I be not guilty as I be a soldier 
and in that oath I will not be forswear 
to save as many life be they within i

do you come to mad i 

if you will be calm I will tell you what I come for

while calm I clear these thus by the honour 
and faith of a true soldier I be clear

which know my innocence I do not urge 
to save my life from the king violent fury 
nor any way to close with thou in friendship 
now that my fortune be at worst So speak 
it be long a come I begin to think 
it be some good you be so loath to utter it

to make my moan to you insomuch as now 
I do conceive you noble virtuous honest 

foh this be worse than all the rest this stink 
of the courtputrefaction flattery gross 
but on I prithee talk be such a novelty 
I will hear any thing 

I can not see your virtue when it shine 
through the radiant favour of the king 
it dazzle i with envy then but now 
like the red sun through cold and misty vapour 
I can behold it at the full 

So so umh whu so much for my virtue 
what be your business now 

I say I come to make my moan to you 
groan beneath a weighty injury 
the king have throw upon i 

have deny he 
something I warrant that he will have beg 
the make of a knight or some such foolery 
what be it

office become so base 

no sir the hangman office Read that 
I be command there and warrant 
with present speed to bring your head to he 

a prayer or two by his great leave and you 
and you shall have it instant 

my lord you shall not undervalue it so 
that honour which have win i to you shall 
work better for your preservation 
I have much more to tell you and strong reason 
why you shall live of the queen infinite wrong 
and you wrought by your daughter cruel ambition 

this be a nobleness beyond example 
sure now you be honest 

there you see my strength 
if now for truth and honour cause I strain 
a point of loyalty you will engage 
your honour to secure i 

I hold my honour equal to the best 
and prize it still so far above my life 
that to save kingdom I will not forfeit it 
here in the sight of heaven I do engage it 
for your security 

I ask no better keeper 

my lord 

dismiss that guard and give we way 

I shall 

now come my lord virtue may be cast by 
but never overcome by tyranny 

war sword law axe or tyranny fell knife 
may overcome my person not my life 
for that be you Petruccio 

turn out of all and cast into the world 
and that forbid too to pity i 
no succour no relief to be afford 
heaven still be where it be and can lose 
the providence it ever have let those 
that think i wretched now consider that 
and be with i convert to a faith 
that will proclaim we happy what be my loss 
what be the state and glory of a court 
but step and light through dangerous ambition 
to end beyond ourselves in who achievement 
we make ourselves but nothing to ourselves 
and all that we be then be to the world 
which render we great title which take off 
we then return unto ourselves again 
and all the world be we I be not great 
till now nor can I confident say 
any thing be i own till I have nothing 
they do but sleep that live in high pomp 
and all their happiness be but a dream 
when i be real nay nay I can prove it 
their costly fare breed riot my content 
their rich attire be but mere pageantry 
make to please their eye mine keep i warm 
and healthful when a cold become their sickness 
they boast of honour and gentility 
for their attendant then when the chief honour 
of the best woman meek obedience 
be my own handmaid and my patience 
a sweet servant than gentility 
continual my other for council and defence what have I now 
they have the help of worldly wise man brain 
and I the comfort of my fruitful prayer 
they have tall bigboned servant for defence 
I the strong guard of all my innocence 
what music have the court compare to this 
or what comparison can all their sport 
and revel hold with those of kid and fawn 
and frisk lamb upon the country lawn 
which be my hourly pleasant entertainment 
in all my wander in which I have not 
hunger at any time but I have find 
meat which I due earn nor ever thirst 
but I have find a spring that have refresh i 
and be no soon weary than I find 
a shelter or a shade to rest i in 
as now in which a slumber begin to creep 
over my eye more soft than any sleep 
can these my sense when I lay of late 
on down beneath the canopy of state 

what soft what sweet what heavenly trance be this 
I feel myself inspire with holy flame 
above the heat of mortal sure I have 
the spirit of prophecy the gift of heal 
and art of teach hide mystery 
thank heaven that first do send i patience 
to sweeten my affliction and now 
plentiful mean to live for other good 
who live but for themselves be but for show 
and stand like barren tree where good may grow 

farewell thou foolish pomp and pride of court 
who shine be but a ignis fatuus 
that lead fond mortal from the path of virtue 
and tract of real comfort thus I shake 
thy wanton dust from off my foot to tread 
the way of truth and innocence this air 
breathe health upon i peace and perfect pleasure 
where the swell court sophisticated breath 
do but disease my blood and taint my sense 

it be good Lodovico though disguise 
I can no less than know he and the poor fool 
that be my servant they come to relieve i 
in these disguise that I may not know 
from who I receive comfort 

to this way 
the most unfortunate queen incline her course 
and see already how her want and woe 
have wear she to the bone alas she be pine 

and look you new master yonder be my old mistress 
what fool be we that can not find she soon 
Alas I can see through she there be not 
so thin a queen in the card 

hold thou good woman pray thou take it quick 
I come now from a feast where we have plenty 
and bring these dainty mean unto another 
but my dear charity tell i thou do want it 
I pray thou eat it do not look but eat it 

what traitor be thou that present i poison 

by all the truth and honesty in man 
it be wholesome food see I will be thy taster 
though in good sooth it grieve i to beguile thou 
of the least morsel sure thou have need of it 
good woman eat and let not famine be 
fearful of poison or false treachery 

be it not poison to a loyal heart 
to eat contrary to the king command 

no if it be what a many will have be poison the last lend that may live to be very good subject very good subject all the year after except a few fishday 

alas we be plain poor country folk and hear no such news

I will write at large each passage to the king 
against the good eulalia will or knowledge 

I will be your faithful messenger my lord 

thank my good Pedro but remember silence 
so deep in thought good madam 

never enough in contemplation of my happiness 

it be your heavenly mind that sweeten all thing 

what be the matter man 
doubtless and without all peradventure more miracle 

the news good neighbour 

o neighbour Poggio and Lollio such a news such a discovery such a thing be come to pass such a business be come to light as your heart never hear your tongue never think nor your ear ever utter you can hear it but it will drown you in a sea of admiration never to rise again in your right wit 

now be I mad till I hear it 

thou shall tell i first whether it be good or bad or I will not hear it 

it be good or bad I assure you and therefore you may be go 

I mean which be it good or bad 

I say it be good and bad and you may both stay and be go hear it or hear it not an it please you 

nay thou be in thy gibe now how good or how bad be thy news 
I pray thou neighbour I do pray thou how good or bad be it 

nay then it be neither good nor bad but both the best and the worst that ever you hear in your life and the worst shall out first what do you think of the woman that we have get among we 

who the holy woman that we be all so bind to pray for I hope no ill be betide she 

Come she be a witch flat and plain say to be a witch 

do not I tell you she be a unknown woman and therefore a good one quoth you but say I doubtless and without all peradventure all that she do be but a kind of witchcraft 

it can fie it can be how be she find so I do not say she be find a witch but she be accuse for one 

by who be she accuse 

by two brave man at arm that come from court 
with purpose to have kill she for the same 
to be short they find she out and naked sword they draw 
but as they think to have thrust she through and through 
they both dead palsystruck fall to the ground 

and have no strength but of their tongue to wound 
the fame she have 

virtue can want no foe 

with that they cry she be a witch and swear 
she also be that queen which for a whore 
the king have turn away 

this be indeed the best news thou can bring 
now doubtless and without all peradventure it be the queen indeed and if she be not a witch I be sorry I think so with all my heart where be those man we will hang they present 

no the queen if she be the queen will not have they hurt more than they be we weet about to execute they but she will not suffer it 

goodness itself 

nay without all peradventure if there be goodness above ground I say and I say it again it be in that woman 

she will have cure they present herself but can not do it because the cruel caitiff will not confess their sin as she make we you know before her gift can cure we by the same token I suffer a hour torment that I may have escape because I be so loath to bring out that naughty business betwixt i and the miller wife 

it be well you confess at last 

ay and they will be glad to confess before they be able to stir hand or foot I warrant and so I tell they when I lodge they both love together upon straw in my barn too good for they and so I tell they too for be traitor to her holiness

speak of Petruccio he be turn traitor 
and animate the soldier against i 
upon the discontent Alinda give he 
now in her fury be it not so

Petruccio be loyal it be his loyalty 
and most sincere obedience to your will 
that bring he to the ruin of his life 
unless your awful presence make prevention 

be then his loyalty become his danger 

as thus great sir in the late execution 
of deathdoomed Sforza which the soldier 
not look on your justice but the feud 
that be betwixt Petruccio and he 
resent as if it be petruccio act 
not you that cut he off and still as mad 
bewitch with Sforza love as ignorant 
of the desert of brave Petruccio 
they all turn head upon he and as if 
it be in his power to new create he to they 
they cry to he for Sforza Sforza or if not 
petruccio life must answer Sforza blood 

leave you he in that distress 

he do prevail 
with much entreaty by some private reason 
upon their fury for a hour respite 
in which dear time it be only you may save 
guiltless Petruccio from a timeless grave 

thou be a soldier be not 

and have command in your highness war 

methinks I shall remember but I will trust thou 

I hope you will be advise though how you run 
into this wildfire of rebellion 

my fortune be more desperate than his 
I be beset and circle in with mischief 
waylaid with heap of danger everywhere 
yet I will on king be not make to fear 
I will fetch he off and the more ready 
for my misprision of his loyalty 
can I think that man false 

no sir nor I 
by all mean fetch he off that loyal general 
be tenfold worth the whole rebellious army 
save he and hang they all 

have you no faith nor due obedience 
unto the king this outrage be against he 
in i he suffer 

we obey the king 
and it be his justice that we cut your throat 
for do such outrage in the death of our brave general 
that have you life more than false drop of blood

your limit hour draw on apace prepare 

he be come within that hour that shall relieve i 
where be he be he come

we dare to kill the hangman of our general 
and think it fit our office best though you

and hang he up yourself for he affirm 
that he let Sforza live against your command 
and that be the lie we treat of 

I will give you all your pardon and he honour 
to make that true Sfor your kingly word be take

of which he seem so full there can be 
a angle in his breast to lodge so base 
a inmate as disloyalty if so

the subtlety of heart show i some light 
through these cymmerian mist of doubt and fear

more exclamation what distract you now 

coram senature acta est sub judice lie est 
Ocurvae in terris animae the rustic 
have take again the law into their hand 
and will you tender clemency non justante 
a courtier hang his sweet face nec invante 

what be his name 

his name be hight Alphonso 
that treason bring in pectore and Skonso 

who be the head of the judicious faction 

Andrea Lollio Poggio the drudge 
have get the people voice to their judge 

dare they do this 

yes judge they will be 
and kill they say the snake of treachery 

I hope we may come yet to stay their sentence 

pray bring we to the place where if we can 
let we avert their judgement from this man 

and can these turmoil never have a end 
unless we load our head and shoulder thus 
our body eke with justice capa pe 
and pepper all our brain with policy 

it be time to have a care ay and a piteous care 

a pious care you mean 

well pious then 
you will show your own wit who clothes soever you wear 
so do the wit of the time but as I say 
it be time we have a care for though our queen 
our school mistress I will say be merciful idleful 
it be fit that we be prejudicious in the state 

judicious brother 

Jew in your face 
trip i again 

agree upon it brother sage of the bench 
my brother Poggio here say very well 
and learned and as I will have say myself 
if you will take his meaning to wit that as 
our school mistress dote upon 
clemency it be fit that we run mad upon cruelty 
something she in the midst we shall jump into the saddle of justice 

I do say so without all peradventure 
for if the candle of her mercy be not put out 
we shall short see more honest man than knave among we 

more knave you mean brother 

I mean no more knave than yourself brother 

agree again sage brother of the bench and let no private 
itch grow to a put like scab 

then the point 
do not I understand the purpose of our meeting 
here in our petty parliament if I may so call it 
be it nor for a reformation to pull down 
the queen mercy and set up our justice 
for the prevention of a superabundance of treason 
daily practise against she 

most true and be it fit therefore that you brabble among yourselves and leave all worse than you find it 

no we will make such a reformation that treason shall not dare to peep over the hedge of her dominion but we will take it by the nose and punish it indign most indign will we punish it 

all this I grant but before we sit and bustle on the bench because it be and that without all peradventure the first time that ever we play so wise a part be it not fit to take advice among ourselves how to deform ourselves in our office 

de do you say in in you shall say 

in with your horn how now 

nay brother of the bench 

do he think to control i because he have be a sexton and a little more book learn then a lay man with a amen forsooth 

nay brother this will control the business 

or because he have be in many a man grave before he do he think no man so deep in grave matter as himself 

well I forbear 

shall he bid i in in as if I be not his inferior 

I forbear still 

I will show myself his inferior I and a great man than he and to prove myself a great man let he hang one I will save two 

still orbear 

pray brother yet agree and remember we use no mercy 

let he that use any mercy lack mercy for my part 

then let we sit and fall to the business 

sit and fall be that so wise speak of a booklearned man now 

still I forbear passion become not judge 
now bring in the offender the new and last offender 

pray think on your speech
