or I will strain hard for it 

how the mammet twitter 
Come come my lady stay for we 

will I have be 
her ladyship the last night 

no more of that wench 

I be strange trouble yet why I shall nourish 
a fury here and with imagine food 
have no real ground on which to raise 
a building of suspicion she be ever 
or can be false hereafter I in this 
but foolish inquire the knowledge of 
a future sorrow which if I find out 
my present ignorance be a cheap purchase 
though with my loss of be I have already 
deal with a friend of i a general scholar 
one deep read in nature hide secret 
and though with much unwillingness have win he 
to do as much as be can to resolve i 
my fate that follow to my wish he be come 
julio Baptista now I may affirm 
your promise and performance walk together 
and therefore without circumstance to the point 
instruct i what I be 

I can wish you have 
make trial of my love some other way 

nay this be from the purpose 

if you can 
proportion your desire to any mean 
I do pronounce you happy I have find 
by certain rule of be your matchless wife 
be to this present hour from all pollution 
free and untainted 

good 

in reason therefore 
you shall fix here and make no far search 
of what may fall hereafter 

o Baptista 
it be not in i to master so my passion 
I must know far or you have make good 
but half your promise while my love stand by 
hold she upright and my presence be 
a watch upon she her desire be meet to 
with equal ardour from i what one proof 
can she give of her constancy be untempted 
but when I be absent and my come back 
uncertain and those wanton heat in woman 
not to be quench by lawful mean and she 
the absolute disposer of herself 
without control or curb nay more invite 
by opportunity and all strong temptation 
if then she hold out 

as no doubt she will 

those doubt must be make certainty Baptista 
by your assurance or your boast art 
deserve no admiration how you trifle 
and play with my affliction I be on 
the wrack till you confirm i 

sure Mathias 
I be no god nor can I dive into 
her hide thought or know what her intent be 
that be deny to art and keep conceal 
even from the devil themselves they can but guess 
out of long observation what be likely 
but positive to foretell that this shall be 
you may conclude impossible all I can 
I will do for you when you be distant from she 
a thousand league as if you then be with she 
you shall know true when she be solicit 
and how far wrought on 

I desire no more 

take then this little model of Sophia 
with more than humane skill lime to the life 
each line and lineament of it in the draw 
so punctual observe that have it motion 
in so much it be herself 

it be indeed 
a admirable piece but if it have not 
some hide virtue that I can guess at 
in what can it advantage i 

I will instruct you 
carry it still about you and as oft 
as you desire to know how she be affect 
with curious eye peruse it while it keep 
the figure it now have entire and perfect 
she be not only innocent in fact 
but unattempted but if once it vary 
from the true form and what be now white and red 
incline to yellow rest most confident 
she be with all violence court but unconquered 
but if it turn all black it be a assurance 
the fort by composition or surprise 
be force or with her free consent surrender 

how much you have engage i for this favour 
the service of my whole life shall make good 

we will not part so I will along with you 
and it be needful with the rise sun 
the army meet yet ere the fight begin 
in spite of opposition I will place you 
in the head of the hungarian general troop 
and near his person 

as my better angel 
you shall direct and guide i 

as we ride 
I will tell you more 

in all thing I will obey you 

when come the post 

the last night 

from the camp 

yes as it be say and the letter write and sign 
by the general Ferdinand 

nay then sans question 
it be of moment 

it concern the life 
of two great army 

be it cheerful 
receive by the king 

yes for be assure 
the army be in view of one another 
have proclaim a public fast and prayer 
for the good success dispatch a gentleman 
of his privy chamber to the general 
with absolute authority from he 
to try the fortune of a day 

no doubt then 
the general will come on and fight it brave 
heaven prosper he this military art 
I grant to be the noble of profession 
and yet I thank my star for it I be never 
incline to learn it since this bubble honour 
which be indeed the nothing soldier fight for 
with the loss of limb or life be in my judgement 
too dear a purchase 

give i our courtwarfare 
the danger be not great in the encounter 
of a fair mistress 

fair and sound together 
do very well Ubaldo but such be 
with difficulty to be find out and when they know 
their value prize too high by thy own report 
thou be at twelve a gamester and since that 
study all kind of female from the nighttrader 
in the street with certain danger to thy pocket 
to the great lady in her cabinet 
that spend upon thou more in cullis 
to strengthen thy weak back then will maintain 
twelve Flanders mare and as many run horse 
beside apothecary and chirurgeon bill 
pay upon all occasion and those frequent 

you talk Ricardo as if yet you be 
a novice in those mystery 

by no mean 
my doctor can assure the contrary 
I lose no time I have feel the pain and pleasure 
as he that be a gamester and play often 
must sometime be a loose 

wherefore then 
do you envy i 

it grow not from my want 
nor thy abundance but be as I be 
the likely man and of much more experience 
my good part be my curtsy there be no beauty 
but yield ere it be summon and as nature 
have sign i the monopoly of maidenhead 
there be none can buy till I have make my market 
satiety cloy i as I live I will part with 
half my estate nay travail over the world 
to find that only phoenix in my search 
that can hold out against i 

be not rap so 
you may spare that labour as she be a woman 
what think you of the queen 

I dare not aim at 
the petticoat royal that be still except 
yet be she not my king be the abstract 
of all that be rare or to be wish in woman 
to write she in my catalogue have enjoy she 
I will venture my neck to a halter but we talk of 
impossibility as she have a beauty 
will make old Nestor young such majesty 
draw forth a sword of terror to defend it 
as will fright Paris though the queen of love 
vow her best furtherance to he 

have you observe 
the gravity of her language mix with sweetness 

then at what distance she reserve herself 
when the king himself make his approach to she 

as she be still a virgin and his life 
but one continue woo 

she well know 
her worth and value it 

and so far the king be 
indulgent to her humour that he forbear 
the duty of a husband but when she call for it 

all his imagination and thought 
be bury in she the loud noise of war 
can awake he 

at this very instant 
when both his life and crown be at the stake 
he only study her content and when 
she be please to show herself music and mask 
be with all care and cost provide for she 

this night she promise to appear 

you may believe it by the diligence of the king 
as if he be her harbinger 

these room 
be not perfume as we direct 

not sir 
I know not what you will have I be sure the smoke 
cost treble the price of the whole week provision 
spend in your majesty kitchen 

how I scorn 
thy gross comparison when my Honoria 
the amazement of the present time and envy 
of all succeed age do descend 
to sanctify a place and in her presence 
make it a temple to i can I be 
too curious much less prodigal to receive she 
but that the splendour of her beam of beauty 
have strike thou blind 

as dotage have do yond 

dotage oh blasphemy be it in i 
to serve she to her merit be she not 
the daughter of a king 

and you the son 
of we I take it by what privilege else 
do you reign over we for my part I know not 
where the disparity lie 

her birth old man 
old in the kingdom service which protect thou 
be the least grace in she and though her beauty 
may make the thunderer a rival for she 
they be but superficial ornament 
and faint speak she from her heavenly mind 
be all antiquity and fiction lose 
our modern poet can not in their fancy 
but fashion a Minerva far transcend 
the imagine one who Homer only dream of 
but then add this she be i my Eubulus 
and though she know one glance from her fair eye 
must make all gazer her idolater 
she be so spare of their influence 
that to shun superstition in other 
she shoot her powerful beam only at i 
and can I then who she desire to hold 
her kingly captive above all the world 
who nation and empire if she please 
she may command as slave but glad pay 
the humble tribute of my love and service 
nay if I say of adoration to she 
I do not err 

well since you hug your fetter 
in love name wear they you be a king and that 
conclude you wise your will a powerful reason 
which we that be foolish subject must not argue 
and what in a mean man I shall call folly 
be in your majesty remarkable wisdom 
but for i I subscribe 

do and look up 
upon this wonder 

wonder it be more sir 

a rapture a astonishment 

what think you sir 

as the king think that be the sure guard 
we courtier ever lie at be prince ever 
so drown in dotage without spectacle 
I can see a handsome woman and she be so 
but yet to admiration look not on she 
heaven how he fawn and as it be his duty 
with what assure gravity she receive it 
her hand again o she at length vouchsafe 
her lip and as he have suck nectar from it 
how he be exalt woman in their nature 
affect command but this humility 
in a husband and a king mark she the way 
to absolute tyranny So Juno be place 
in jove tribunal and like Mercury 
forget his own greatness he attend 
for her employment she prepare to speak 
what oracle shall we hear now 

that you please sir 
with such assurance of love and favour 
to grace your handmaid but in be you sir 
a matchless queen and one that know herself so 
bind i in retribution to deserve 
the grace confer upon i 

you transcend 
in all thing excellent and it be my glory 
your worth weigh true to depose myself 
from absolute command surrender up 
my will and faculty to your disposure 
and here I vow not for a day or year 
but my whole life which I wish long to serve you 
that whatsoever I injustice may 
exact from these my subject you from i 
may bold challenge and when you require it 
in sign of my subjection as your vassal 
thus I will pay my homage 

o forbear sir 
let not my lip envy my robe on they 
print your allegiance often I desire 
no other fealty 

gracious sovereign 
boundless in bounty 

be not here fine fooling 
he be questionless bewitch will I be geld 
so that will disenchant he though I forfeit 
my life for it I must speak by your good leave sir 
I have no suit to you nor can you grant one 
have no power you be like i a subject 
her more than serene majesty be present 
and I must tell you it be ill manner in you 
have depose yourself to keep your hat on 
and not stand bare as we do be no king 
but a fellow subject with we gentleman usher 
it do belong to your place see it reform 
he have give away his crown and can challenge 
the privilege of his bonnet 

do not tempt i 

tempt you in what in follow your example 
if you be angry question i hereafter 
as Ladislaus shall do Eubulus 
on equal term you be of late my sovereign 
but weary of it I now bend my knee 
to her divinity and desire a boon 
from she more than magnificence 

take it free 
nay be not move for our mirth sake let we hear he 

it be but to ask a question have you never read 
the story of Semiramis and Ninus 

not as I remember 

I will then instruct you 
and it be to the purpose this Ninus be a king 
and such a impotent love king as this be 
but now he be none this nine pray you observe i 
dote on this Semiramis a smith wife 
I must confess there the comparison hold not 
you be a king daughter yet under your correction 
like she a woman this assyrian monarch 
of who this be a pattern to express 
his love and service seat she as you be 
in his regal throne and bind by oath his noble 
forget all allegiance to himself 
one day to be her subject and to put 
in execution whatever she 
please to impose upon they pray you command he 
to minister the like to we and than 
you shall hear what follow 

well sir to your story 

you have no warrant stand by let i know 
your pleasure goddess 

let this nod assure you 

goddess like indeed as I live a pretty idol 
she know her power wise make use of it 
and fear his inconstancy and repentance 
of what he have grant as in reason madam 
you may do his that he may never have 
power to recall his grant or question she 
for her short government instant give order 
to have his head strike off 

be it possible 

the story say so and commend her wisdom 
for make use of her authority 
and it be worth your imitation madam 
he love subjection and you be no queen 
unless you make he feel the weight of it 
you be more than all the world to he and that 
he may be foe to you and not seek change 
when his delight be sate mew he up 
in some close prison if you let he live 
which be no policy and there diet he 
as you think fit to feed your appetite 
since there end his ambition 

devilish counsel 

the king be amaze 

the queen appear too full 
of deep imagination Eubulus 
have put both to it 

now she seem resolve 
I long to know the issue 

give i leave 
dear sir to reprehend you for appear 
perplex with what this old man out of envy 
of your unequalled grace shower upon i 
have in his fabulous story saucy 
apply to i sir that you only nourish 
one doubt Honoria dare abuse the power 
with which she be invest by your favour 
or that she ever can make use of it 
to the injury of you the great bestower 
take from your judgement it be your delight 
to seek to i with more obsequiousness 
than I desire And stand it with my duty 
not to receive what you be please to offer 
I do but act the part you put upon i 
and though you make i personate a queen 
and you my subject when the play your pleasure 
be at a period I be what I be 
before I enter still your humble wife 
and you my royal sovereign 

admirable 

I have hear of captain take more with danger 
than the reward and if in your approach 
to those delight which be your own and free 
to heighten your desire you make the passage 
narrow and difficult shall I prescribe you 
or blame your fondness or can that swell i 
beyond my just proportion 

above wonder 

heaven make i thankful for such goodness 

now sir 
the state I take to satisfy your pleasure 
I change to this humility and the oath 
you make to i of homage I thus cancel 
and seat you in your own 

I be transport 
beyond myself 

and now to your wise lordship 
be I prove a Semiramis or have 
my Ninus as malicious you make he 
cause to repent the excess of favour to i 
which you call dotage 

answer wretch 

I dare sir 
and say however the event may plead 
in your defence you have a guilty cause 
nor be it wisdom in you I repeat it 
to teach a lady humble in herself 
with the ridiculous dotage of a lover 
to be ambitious 

Eubulus I be so 
it be root in i you mistake my temper 
I do profess myself to be the most 
ambitious of my sex but not to hold 
command over my lord such a proud torrent 
will sink i in my wish not that I 
be ignorant how much I can deserve 
and may with justice challenge 

This I look for 
after this seem humble ebb I know 
a gush tide will follow 

by my birth 
and liberal gift of nature as of fortune 
from you as thing beneath i I expect 
what be due to majesty in which I be 
a sharer with your sovereign 

good again 

and as I be most eminent in place 
in all my action I will appear so 

you need not fear a rival 

I hope not 
and till I find one I disdain to know 
what envy be 

you be above it madam 

for beauty without art discourse and free 
from affectation with what grace else 
can in the wife and daughter of a king 
be wish I dare prefer myself 

as I 
blush for you lady trumpet your own praise 
This speak by the people have be hear 
with honour to you do the court afford 
no oiltongued parasite that you be force 
to be your own gross flatterer 

be dumb 
thou spirit of contradiction 

the wolf 
but bark against the moon and I contemn it 
the mask you promise 

let they enter how 

here be one I fear unlooked for 

from the camp 

the general victorious in your fortune 
kiss your hand in this sir 

that great power 
who at his pleasure do dispose of battle 
be ever praise for it Read sweet and partake it 
the Turk be vanquish and with little loss 
upon our part in which our joy be double 

but let it not exalt you bear it sir 
with moderation and pay what you owe for it 

I understand thou Eubulus I will not now 
inquire particular our delight defer 
with reverence to the temple there we will tender 
our soul devotion to his dread might 
who edge our sword and teach we how to fight 

you like my speech 

yes if you give it action 
in the delivery 

if I pity you 
I have play the fool before this be not the first time 
nor shall be I hope the last 

nay I think so to 

and if I put she not out of her dump with laughter 
I will make she howl for anger 

not too much 
of that good fellow Hilario our sad lady 
have drink too often of that bitter cup 
a pleasant one must restore she with what patience 
will she endure to hear of the death of my lord 
that mere out of doubt he may miscarry 
afflict herself thus 

umh it be a question 
a widow only can resolve there be some 
that in their husband sickness have weep 
their pottle of tear a day but be once certain 
at midnight he be dead have in the morning 
dry up their handkerchief and think no more on it 

tush she be none of that race if her sorrow 
be not true and perfect I against my sex 
will take my oath woman never weep in earnest 
she have make herself a prisoner to her chamber 
dark as a dungeon in which no beam 
of comfort enter she admit no visit 
eat little and her nightly music be 
of sigh and groan tune to such harmony 
of feel grief that I against my nature 
be make one of the consort this hour only 
she take the air a custom every day 
she solemn observe with greedy hope 
from some that pass by to receive assurance 
of the success and safety of her lord 
now if that your device will take 

never fear it 
I be provide cap a pe and have 
my property in readiness 

bring my veil there 

be go I hear she come 

if I do not 
appear and what be more appear perfect hiss i 

I be flatter once I be a star but now 
turn a prodigious meteor and like one 
hang in the air between my hope and fear 
and every hour the little stuff burn out 
that yield a wane light to die comfort 
I do expect my fall and certain ruin 
in wretched thing more wretched be delay 
and hope a parasite to i be unmask 
appear more horrid than despair and my 
distraction worse than madness even my prayer 
when with most zeal send upward be pull down 
with strong imaginary doubt and fear 
and in their sudden precipice overwhelm i 
dream and fantastic vision walk the round 
about my widow bed and every slumber 
break with loud alarm can these be then 
but sad presage girl 

you make they so 
and antedate a loss shall never fall on you 
such pure affection such mutual love 
a bed and undefiled on either part 
a whore without contention in two body 
one will and soul like to the rod of concord 
kiss each other can be short live 
or end in barrenness if all these dear madam 
sweet in your sadness shall produce no fruit 
or leave the age no model of yourselves 
to witness to posterity what you be 
succeed time fright with the example 
but hear of your story will instruct 
their fair issue to meet sensual 
like other creature and forbear to raise 
true love or Himen altar

and they be build upon a weak foundation 
to raise i comfort ten long day be past

contemptible to those I feed you minion 
have a hand in it to as it appear 
your petticoat serve for base to this warrior 

we do it for your mirth 

for myself I hope 
I have speak like a soldier 

hence you rascal 
I never but with reverence name my lord 
and can I here it by thy tongue profane 
and not correct thy folly but you be 
transform and turn knight errant take your course 
and wander where you please for here I vow 
by my lord life a oath I will not break 
till his return or certainty of his safety 
my door be shut against thou 

you have make 
a fine piece of work on it how do you like the quality 
you have a foolish itch to be a actor 
and may stroll where you please 

will you buy my share 

no certain I fear I have already 
too much of my own I will only as a damsel 
as the book say thus far help to disarm you 
and so dear don Quixote take my leave 
I leave you to your fortune 

have I swear 
my brain out for this quaint and rare invention 
and be I thus reward I can turn 
tragedian and roar now but that I fear 
it will get i too great a stomach have no meat 
to pacify colon what will become of i 
I can beg in armour and steal I dare not 
my end must be to stand in a corn field 
and fright away the crow for bread and cheese 
or find some hollow tree in the high way 
and there until my lord return sell switch 
no more Hilario but Dolorio now 
I will weep my eye out and be blind of purpose 
to move compassion and so I vanish 

be the gentleman send before as it be order 
by the king direction to entertain 
the general 

long since they by this have meet he 
and give he the beinvenue 

I hope I need not 
instruct you in your part 

how we my lord 
fear not we know our distance and degree 
to the very inch where we be to salute he 

the state be miserable if the court have none 
of her own breed familiar with all garb 
gracious in England Italy Spain or France 
with form and punctuality to receive 
stranger ambassador for the general 
he be a mere native and it matter not 
which way we do accost he 

it be great pity 
that such as sit at the helm provide no better 
for the training up of the gentry in my judgement 
a academy erect with large pension 
to such as in a table can set down 
the congee cringe posture method phrase 
proper to every nation 

o it be 
a admirable piece of work 

and yet rich fool 
throw away their charity on hospital 
for beggar and lame soldier and never study 
the due regard to compliment and courtship 
matter of more import and be indeed 
the glory of a monarchy 

these no doubt 
be state point gallant I confess but sure 
our court need no aid this way since it be 
a school of nothing else there be some of you 
who I for bear to name who coin head 
be the mint of all new fashion that have do 
more hurt to the kingdom by superfluous bravery 
which the foolish gentry imitate then a war 
or a long famine all the treasure by 
this foul excess be get into the merchant 
embroiderer silkman jeweller tailor hand 
and the three part of the land to the nobility 
engross title only 

my lord you be bitter 

the general be alight and now enter 

be he ten general I be prepare 
and know what I will do 

pray you what Ricardo 

I will fight at compliment with he 

I will charge home to 

and that be a desperate service if you come off well 

captain command the officer to keep 
the soldier as he march in rank and file 
till they hear far from i 

here be one speak 
in another key this be no cant language 
teach in your academy 

nay I will present you 
to the king myself 

a grace beyond my merit 

you undervalue what I can set 
too high a price on 

with a friend true heart 
I gratulate your return 

next to the favour 
of the great king I be happy in your friendship 

by courtship course on both side 

pray you receive 
this stranger to your knowledge on my credit 
at all part he deserve it 

your report 
be a strong assurance to i sir most welcome 

This say by you the reverence of your age 
command i to believe it 

this be pretty 
but second i now I can stoop too low 
to do your excellence that due observance 
your fortune claim 

he never think on his virtue 

for be as you be the soul of soldier 
and bulwark of Bellona 

the protection 
both of the court and king 

and the sole minion 
of mighty Mars 

one that with justice may 
increase the number of the worthy 

hoy day 

it be impossible in my arm to circle 
such giant worth 

at distance we presume 
to kiss your honour gauntlet 

what reply now 
can he make to this foppery 

you have say 
gallant so much and hitherto do so little 
that it ill I learn to speak and you to do 
I must take time to thank you 

as I live 
answer as I can wish how the fop gape now 

this be harsh and scurvy 

we will be revenge 
when he come to court the lady and laugh at he 

nay do your office gentleman and conduct 
the general to the presence 

keep your order 

make way for the general 

what wise man 
that with judicious eye look one a soldier 
but must confess that fortune swinge be more 
over that profession than all kind else 
of life pursue by man they in a state 
be but as surgeon to wound man 
even desperate in their hope while pain and anguish 
make they blaspheme and call in vain for death 
their wife and child kiss the surgeon knee 
promise he mountain if his save hand 
restore the torture wretch to former strength 
but when grim death by Aesculapius art 
be fright from the house and health appear 
in sanguine colour on the sick man face 
all be forget and ask his reward 
he be pay with curse often receive wound 
from he who wound he cure so soldier 
though of more worth and use meet the same fate 
as it be too apparent I have observe 
in one hue 
when horrid Mars the touch of who rough hand 
with palsy shake a kingdom have put on 
his dreadful helmet and with terror fill 
the place where he like a unwelcome guest 
resolve to revel how the lord of she like 
the tradesman merchant and litigious pleader 
and such like scarab breed in the dung of peace 
in hope of their protection humble offer 
their daughter to their bed heir to their service 
and wash with tear their sweat their dust their scar 
but when those cloud of war that menace 
a bloody deluge to the affright state 
be by their breath disperse and over blow 
and famine blood and death Bellona page 
whip from the quiet continent to Thrace 
soldier that like the foolish hedge sparrow 
to their own ruin hatch this cuckoo peace 
be straight think burdensome since want of mean 
grow from want of action breed contempt 
and that the worst of ill fall to their lot 
their service with the danger soon forget 

the queen my lord have make choice of this roome 
to see the mask 

I will be looker on 
my dance day be pass 

this courtesy 
to a stranger my Honoria keep fair rank 
with all your rarity after your travail 
look on our court delight but first from your 
relation with erect ear I will hear 
the music of your war which must be sweet 
end in victory 

not to trouble 
your majesty with description of a battle 
too full of horror for the place and to 
avoid particular which I shall deliver 
I must trench long on your patience then 
my manner will give way to in a word sir 
it be well fight on both side and almost 
with equal fortune it continue doubtful 
upon who tent plume victory will take 
her glorious stand impatient of delay 
with the flower of our prime gentleman I charge 
their main battalia and with their assistance 
break in but when I be almost assure 
that they be rout by a stratagem 
of the subtle Turk who open his gross body 
and rally up his troop on either side 
I find myself so far engage for I 
must not conceal my error that I know not 
which way with honour to come off 

I like 
a general that tell his fault and be not 
ambitious to engross unto himself 
all honour as some have in which with justice 
they can not claim a share 

be thus hem in 
their scimitar rage among we and my horse 
kill under i I every minute look for 
a honourable end and that be all 
my hope can fashion to i circle thus 
with death and horror as one send from heaven 
this man of man with some choice horse that follow 
his brave example do pursue the tract 
his sword cut for they and but that I see he 
already blush to hear what he be present 
I know will wish unspoken I shall say sir 
by what he do we bold may believe 
all that be write of Hector 

general 
pray spare these strange hyperbole 

do not blush 
to hear a truth here be a pair of monsieur 
have they be in your place will have run away 
and never change countenance 

we have your good word still 

and shall while you deserve it 

silence on 

he as I say like dreadful lightning throw 
from Jupiter shield disperse the arm gyre 
with which I be environ horse and man 
shrink under his strong arm more with his look 
fright the valiant flee with which encourage 
my soldier like young eaglet pray under 
the wing of their fierce dame as if from he 
they take both spirit and fire brave come on 
by he I be remount and inspire 
with treble courage and such as flee before 
bold make head again and to confirm they 
it sudden be apparent that the fortune 
of the day be we each soldier and commander 
perform his part but this be the great wheel 
by which the lesser move and all reward 
and sign of honour as the civic garland 
the mural wreath the enemy prime horse 
with the general sword and armour the old honour 
with which the Roman crown their several leader 
to he alone be proper 

and they shall 
deserve fall on he sit it be our pleasure 

which I must serve not argue

but in your service for the king a native 
and though a free queen I be bind in duty 
to cherish virtue wheresoever I find it

to sit so near you 

not have our warrant 

let the masker enter by the preparation 
it be a french brawl a apish imitation 
of what you real perform in battle 
and Pallas bind up in a little volume 

with his lute attend on her 
serve for the induction 

our thank to all 
to the banquet that be prepare to entertain they 
what will my best Honoria 

may it please 
my king that I who by his suffrage ever 
have have power to command may now entreat 
a honour from he 

why shall you desire 
what be your own whatever it be you be 
the mistress of it 

I be happy in 
your grant my suit sir be that your commander 
especial this stranger may as I 
in my discretion shall think good receive 
what be due to their desert

revel and feast which the war end be 
a soldier glory and it be fit that way 
your bounty shall provide for he

and by your narrow thought proportion i 
what I will do now shall be worth the envy 
of Cleopatra open it see here

as stud star in your armour and make the sun 
look dim with jealousy of a great light 
than his beam guild the day with when it be

for your life hazard in the late action

if wealth be my ambition by the queen 
I be make rich already to the amazement 
of all that see or shall hereafter read 
the story of her bounty if to spend 
the remnant of my life in deed of arm 
no region be more fertile of good knight 
from who my knowledge that way may be better 
than this your war like Hungary if favour 
or grace in court can take I by your grant 
far far beyond my merit I may make 
in you a free election but alas sir

which I can resist force to prefer 
my country smoke before the glorious fire 
with which your bounty warm i all I ask sir

of foul ingratitude be your gracious licence 
for my departure

grow rich by your magnificence I be here 
but a body without a soul and till I find it 
in the embrace of my constant wife and to set of that constancy 
in her beauty and matchless excellency without a rival 
I be but half myself 

and be she then 
so chaste and fair as you infer 

o madam 
though it must argue weakness in a rich man 
to show his gold before a arm thief 
and I in praise of my wife but seed 
the fire of lust in other to attempt she 
such be my full sail confidence in her virtue 
though in my absence she be now besiege 
by a strong army of lascivious wooer 
and every one more expert in his art 
than those that tempt chaste Penelope 
though they raise battery by prodigal gift 
by amorous letter vow make for her service 
with all the engine wanton appetite 
can mount to shake the fortress of her honour 
here here be my assurance she hold out 
and be impregnable

a absolute monarch it do show more kinglike 
in those libidinous Caesar that compel 
matron and virgin of all rank to bow 
unto their ravenous lust and do admit 
of more excuse than I can urge for you 
than slave yourself to the imperious humour 
of a proud beauty 

out of my sight 

I will sir 
give way to your furious passion but when reason 
have get the better of it I much hope 
the counsel that offend now will deserve 
your royal thanks tranquillity of mind 
stay with you sir I do begin to doubt 
there be something more in the queen strangeness then 
be yet disclose and I will find it out 
or lose myself in the search 

sure he be honest 
and from your infancy have true serve you 
let that plead for he and impute this harshness 
to the forwardness of his age 

I be much trouble 
and do begin to stagger Ferdinand good night 
tomorrow visit we back to our own lodging 

you have do brave lock this in that room 
there let he ruminate I will anon unhood he 
the other must stay here as soon as I 
have quit the peace give he the liberty 
and use of his eye that do disperse yourselves 
as private as you can but on your life 
no word of what have pass 

if I do sell 
my tongue to a tripe wife come unbind his arm 
you be now at your own disposure and however 
we use you rough I hope you will find here 
such entertainment as will give you cause 
to thank we for the service and so I leave you 

if I be in a prison it be a neat one 
what oh edipus can resolve this riddle ha 
I never give just cause to any man 
base to plot against my life but what be 
become of my true friend for he I suffer 
more than myself 

remove that idle fear 
he be safe as you be 

whosoever thou be 
for he I thank thou I can imagine 
where I shall be though I have read the table 
or errant knighthood stuff with the relation 
of magical enchantment yet I be not 
so sottish credulous to believe the devil 
have that way power ha music 

rise sir and hear my reason in defence 
of the rape for so you may conceive which I 
by my instrument make upon you you perhaps 
may think what you have suffer for my lust 
be a common practice with i but I call 
those ever shine lamp and their great maker 
as witness of my innocence I never look on 
a man but your best self on who I ever 
except the king vouchsafe a eye of favour 

the king indeed and only such a king 
deserve your rarity madam and but he 
it be giant like ambition in any 
in his wish only to presume to taste 
the nectar of your kiss or to feed 
his appetite with that ambrosia due 
and proper to a prince and what bind mores 
a lawful husband for myself great queen 
I be a thing obscure disfurnish of 
all merit that can raise i high than 
in my most humble thankfulness for your bounty 
to hazard my life for you and that way 
I be most ambitious 

I desire no more 
than what you promise if you dare expose 
your life as you profess to do i service 
how can it better be employ then in 
preserve i which only you can do 
and must do with the danger of your own 
a desperate danger to if private man 
can brook no rival in what they affect 
but to the death pursue such as invade 
what law make their inheritance the king 
to who you know I be dear than his crown 
his health his eye his afterhope with all 
his present blessing must fall on that man 
like dreadful lightning that be win by prayer 
threat or reward to stain his bed or make 
his hope for issue doubtful 

if you aim 
at what I more than fear you do the reason 
which you deliver shall in judgement rather 
deter i then invite a grant with my 
assure ruin 

true if that you be 
of a cold temper one who doubt or fear 
in the most horrid form they can put on 
may teach to be ingrateful your denial 
to i that have deserve so much be more 
if it can have addition 

I know not 
what your command be 

have you fight so well 
among army man yet can guess what list 
you be to enter when you be in private 
with a willing lady one that to enjoy 
your company this night deny the king 
access to what be he own if you will press i 
to speak in plain language 

pray you forbear 
I will I do not understand too much 
already by your word I be instruct 
to credit that which not confirm by you 
have breed suspicion in i of untruth 
though a angel have affirm it but suppose 
that cloy with happiness which be ever build 
on virtuous chastity in the wantonness 
of appetite you desire to make trial 
of the false delight propose by vicious lust 
among ten thousand every way more able 
and apt to be wrought on such as owe you 
obedience be your subject why shall you 
make choice of i a stranger 

though yet reason 
be never admit in the court of love 
I will yield you one unanswerable as I urge 
in our last private conference you have 
a pretty promise presence but there be 
many in limb and feature who may take 
that way the right hand file of you beside 
your may of youth be pass and the blood spend 
by wound though brave take render you 
disable for love service and that valour 
set off with better fortune which it may be 
swell you above your bound be not the hook 
that have catch i good sir I need no champion 
with his sword to guard my honour or my beauty 
in both I can defend myself and live 
my own protection 

if these advocate 
the best that can plead for i have no power 
what can you find in i else that may tempt you 
with irrecoverable loss unto yourself 
to be a gainer from i 

you have sir 
a jewel of such matchless worth and lustre 
as do disdain comparison and darken 
all that be rare in other man and that 
I must or win or lessen 

you heap more 
amazement on i what be I possess of 
that you can covet make i understand it 
if it have a name 

yes a imagine one 
but be in substance nothing be a garment 
wear out of fashion and long since give over 
by the court and country it be your loyalty 
and constancy to your wife it be that I dote on 
and do deserve my envy and that jewel 
or by fair play or foul I must win from you 

these be mere contrary if you love i madam 
for my constancy why seek you to destroy it 
in my keep it preserve i worth your favour 
or if it be a jewel of that value 
as you with labour rhetoric will persuade i 
what can you stake against it 

a queen fame 
and equal honour 

So whoever win 
both shall be loser 

that be that I aim at 
yet on the by I lie my youth my beauty 
this moist palm this soft lip and those delight 
darkness shall only judge of do you find they 
infectious in the trial that you start 
as fright with their touch 

be it in man 
to resist such strong temptation 

he begin 
to waver 

madam as you be gracious 
grant this short night deliberation to i 
and with the rise sum from i you shall 
receive full satisfaction 

though extreme 
hate all delay I will deny you nothing 
this key will bring you to your friend you be safe both 
and all thing useful that can be prepare 
for one I love and honour wait upon you 
take counsel of your pillow such a fortune 
as with affection swift wing fly to you 
will not be often tender 

how my blood 
rebel I now can call her back and yet 
there be something stay i if the king have tender 
such favour to my wife it be to be doubt 
they have not be refuse but be a man 
I shall not yield first or prove a example 
for her defence of frailty by this sans question 
she be tempt too and here I may examine 
how she hold out she be still the same the same 
pure crystall rock of chastity perish all 
allurement that may alter i the snow 
of her sweet coldness have extinguish quite 
the fire that but even now begin to flame 
and I by she confirm reward nor title 
nor certain death from the refuse queen 
shall shake my faith since I resolve to be 
loyal to she as she be true to i 

what we speak on the volley begin to work 
we have lay a good foundation 

build it up 
or else it be nothing you have by lot the honour 
of the first assault but as it be condition 
observe the time proportion I will not part with 
my share in the achievement when I whistle 
or hem fall off 

she come stand by I will watch 
my opportunity 

I find myself 
strange distract with the various story 
now well now ill then doubtful by my guest 
deliver of my lord and like poor beggar 
that in their dream find treasure by reflection 
of a wound fancy make it questionable 
whether they sleep or not yet tickle with 
such a fantastic hope of happiness 
wish they may never wake in some such measure 
incredulous of what I see and touch 
as it be a fade apparition I 
be still perplex and trouble and when most 
confirm it be true a curious jealousy 
to be assure by what mean and from who 
such a mass of wealth be first deserve then get 
cunning steal into i I have practise

that you have from i out with it 

it be a a potent spell 
I can resist why I will tell you madam 
and to how many several woman you be 
behold for your bravery this be 
the wedding gown of Paulina a rich strumpet 
worm but a day when she marry old Gonzago 
and leave of trade 

o my heart

your lord to the mask and the weather prove foul 
he lodge in her house all night and merry they be 
but how he come by it I know not

but very good at the sport this diamond

prick in a private arbour as she say 
when the queen ask for it and she hear he sing to 
and dance to his hornpipe or there be liar abroad 
there be other toy about you

with these not worth the relation 
you be happy in a husband never man 
make better use of his strength will you have he waste 
his body away for nothing if he hold out 
there be not a embroider petticoat in the court 
but shall be at your service 

I commend he

your servant madam she sting unto the quick lad 

I do my part if this potion work not hang i 
let she sleep as well as she can tonight tomorrow 
we will mount new battery 

and till then leave she 

you power that take into your care the guard 
of innocence aid i for I be a creature 
so forfeit to despair hope can fancy 
a ransom to redeem i I begin 
to waver in my faith and mark it doubtful 
whither the saint that be canonize for 
their holiness of life sin not in secret 
since my Mathias be fall from his virtue 
in such a open fashion can it be else 
that such a husband so devote to i 
so vow to temperance for lascivious hire 
shall prostitute himself to common harlot 
old and deform to waste for this he leave i 
and in a feign pretence for want of mean 
to give i ornament or to bring home 
disease to i suppose these be false 
and lustful goat if he be true and right 
why stay he so long from i be make rich 
and that the only reason why he leave i 
no he be lose and shall I wear the spoil 
and salary of lust they cleave unto i 
like Nessus poison shirt no in my rage 
I will tear they of and from my body wash 
the venom with my tear have I no spleen 
nor anger of a woman shall he build 
upon my ruin and I unrevenged 
deplore his falsehood no with the same trash 
for which he have dishonour i I will purchase 
a just revenge I be not yet so much 
in debt to year nor so misshape that all 
shall fly from my embrace chastity 
thou only be a name and renounce thou 
I be now a servant to voluptuousness 
wanton of all degree and fashion welcome 
you shall be entertain and if I stray 
let he condemn himself that lead the way 

we be in a desperate strait there be no evasion 
nor hope leave to come of but by your yield 
to the necessity you must feign a grant 
to her violent passion or 

what my Baptista 

we be but dead else 

Were the sword now heave up 
and my neck upon the block I will not buy 
a hour reprieve with the loss of faith and virtue 
to be make immortal here be thou a scholar 
nay almost without parallel and yet fear 
to die which be inevitable you may urge 
the many year that by the course of nature 
we may travail in this tedious pilgrimage 
and hold it as a blessing as it be 
when innocence be our guide yet know Baptista 
our virtue be preserve before our year 
by the great judge to die untainted in 
our fame and reputation be the great 
and to lose that can we desire to live 
or shall I for a momentary pleasure 
which soon come to a period to all time 
have breach of faith and perjury remember 
in a still live epitath no baptist 
since my Sophia will go to her grave 
unspotted in her faith I will follow she 
with equal loyalty but look on this 
your own great work your masterpiece and then 
she be still the same teach i to alter 
ha sure I do not sleep or if I dream 
this be a terrible vision I will clear 
my eyesight perhaps melancholy make i 
see that which be not 

it be too apparent 
I grieve to look upon it beside the yellow 
that do assure she be tempt there be line 
of a dark colour that disperse themselves 
over every miniature of her face and those 
confirm 

she be turn whore 

I must not say so 
yet as a friend to truth if you will have i 
interpret it in her consent and wish 
she be false but not in fact yet 

fact Baptista 
make not yourself a pandar to her looseness 
in labour to palliate what a vizard 
of impudence can cover do ere woman 
in she will decline from chastity but find mean 
to give her hot lust fuel it be more 
impossible in nature for gross body 
descend of themselves to hang in the air 
or with my single arm to underprop 
a fall tower nay in its violent course 
to stop the lightning then to stay a woman 
hurry by two fury lust and falsehood 
in her full carrier to wickedness 

pray you tempter 
the violence of your passion 

in extreme 
of this condition can it be in man 
to use a moderation I be throw 
from a steep rock headlong into a gulf 
of misery and find myself past hope 
in the same moment that I apprehend 
that I be fall and this the figure of 
my idol few hour since while she continue 
in her perfection that be late a mirror 
in which I see miraculous shape of duty 
stay manner with all excellency a husband 
can wish in a chaste wife be on the sudden 
turn to a magical glass and do present 
no thing but horn and horror 

you may yet 
and it be the best foundation build up comfort 
on your own goodness 

no that have undo i 
for now I hold my temperance a sin 
worse than excess and what be vice a virtue 
have I refuse a queen and such a queen 
who ravish beauty at the first sight have tempt 
a hermit from his bead and change his prayer 
to amorous sonnet to preserve my faith 
inviolate to thou with the hazard of 
my death with torture since she can inflict 
no less for my contempt and have I make 
such a return from thou I will not curse thou 
nor for thy falsehood rail against the sex 
it be poor and common I will only with wise man 
whisper unto myself however they seem 
nor present nor past time nor the age to come 
have heretofore can now or ever shall 
produce on constant woman 

this be more 
than the satirist write against they 

there be no language 
that can express the poison of these aspic 
these weep crocodile and all to little 
that have be say against they but I will mould 
my thought into another form and if 
she can outlive the report of what I have do 
this hand when next she come within my reach 
shall be her executioner 

the queen sir 

Wait our command at distance sir you have to 
free liberty to depart 

I know my manner 
and thank you for the favour 

have you take 
good rest in your new lodging I expect now 
your resolute answer but advise mature 
before I hear it 

let my action madam 
for no word can dilate my joy in all

assure your highness and in sign of my 
submission and contrition for my error 
my lip that but the last night shun the touch 
of you as poison teach humility now 
thus on your foot and that too great a honour 
for such a undeserver seal my duty 
a cloudy mist of ignorance equal to 
cimmerian darkness will not let i see then 
what now with adoration and wonder 
with reverence I look up to but those fog 
disperse and scatter by the powerful beam 
with which yourself the sun of all perfection 
vouchsafe to cure my blindness like a suppliant 
as low as I can kneel I humble beg 
what you once please to tender 

this be more 
than I can hope what find you so attractive 
upon my face in so short time to make 
this sudden metamorphosis pray you rise 
I for your late neglect thus sign your pardon 
I now you kiss like a lover and not as brother 
cold salute their sister 

I be turn 
all spirit and fire 

yet to give some allay 
to this hot fervour it be good to remember 
the king who eye and ear be everywhere 
with the danger to that follow this discover 

danger a bugbear madam let ride once 
like Phaeton in the the chariot of your favour 
and I contemn love thunder though the king 
in our embrace stand a looker on 
his hangman and with study cruelty ready 
to drag i from your arm it shall not fright i 
from the enjoy that a single life be 
too poor a price for oh that now all vigour 
of my youth be recollect for a hour 
that my desire may meet with you and draw 
the envy of all man in the encounter 
upon my head I shall but we lose time

of such as do offend make less the sin 
for each particular crime a strict account

now you know all sir with the motive why 
I force he to my lodging 

I desire 
no more such trial lady 

I presume sir 
you do not doubt my chastity 

I will not 
but these be strange inducement 

by no mean sir 
why though he be with violence cease upon 
and still detain the man sir be no soldier 
nor use to charge his pike when the breach be open 
there be no danger in it you must conceive sir 
be religious she choose he for a chaplain 
to read old homily to she in the dark 
she be bind to it by her cannon 

still torment 
with thy impertinence 

by yourself dear sir 
I be ambitious only to over throw 
his boast constancy in his consent 
but for fact I contemn he I be never 
unchaste in thought I labour to give proof 
what power dwell in this beauty you admire so 
and when you see how soon it have transform he 
and with what superstition he adore it 
determine as you please 

I will look on 
this pageant but 

when you have see and hard sir 
the passage which I myself discover 
and can have keep conceal have I mean base 
judge as you please 

well ill observe the issue 

How have you take this general in your wife 

as a strange curiosity but queen 
be privilege above subject and it be fit sir 

you be much alter sir since the last night 
when the queen leave you and look cheerful 
your dulness quite blow over 

I have see a vision 
this morning make it good and never be 
in such security as at this instant 
fall what can fall and when the queen appear 
who short absence now be tedious to i 
observe the encounter 

she already be 
enter the list 

and I prepare to meet she 

I know my duty 

not so you may stay now 
as a witness of our contract 

I obey 
in all thing madam 

where be that reverence 
or rather superstitious adoration 
which captive like to my triumphant beauty 
you pay last night no humble knee nor sign 
or vassal duty sure this be the foot 
to who proud cover and then happy in it 
your lip be glue and that the neck then offer 
to witness your subjection to be tread on 
your certain loss of life in the king anger 
be then to mean a price to buy my favour 
and that false glowworm fire of constancy 
to your wife extinguish by a great light 
shoot from our eye and that it may be be 
too glorious to be look on have deprive you 
oh speech and motion but I will take off 
a little from the splendour and descend 
from my own height and in your lowness here you 
plead as a suppliant 

I do remember 
I once see such a woman 

how 

and then 
she do appear a most magnificent queen 
and what be more virtuous though somewhat darken 
with pride and self opinion 

call you this courtship 

and she be happy in a royal husband 
who envy can not tax unless it be 
for his too much indulgence to her humour 

pray you sir observe that touch it be to the purpose 
I like the play the better for it 

and she live 
worthy her birth and fortune you retain yet 
some part of her angelical form but when 
envy to the beauty of another woman 
inferior to she one she never 
have see but in her picture have disperse 
infection through her vein and loyalty 
which a great queen as she be shall have nourish 
grow odious to she 

I be thunder strike 

and lust in all the bravery it can borrow 
from majesty however disguise have take 
sure foot in the kingdom of her heart 
the throne of chastity once how in a moment 
all that be gracious great and glorious in she 
and win upon all heart like seem shadow 
want true substance vanish 

how his reason 
work on my soul 

retire into yourself 
your own strength madam strong mane with virtue 
and be out as you be and there be no offence 
so base beneath the slavery that man 
impose on beast but I will glad bow to 
but as you play and juggle with a stranger 
vary your shape like Thetis though the beauty 
of all that be by poet rapture saint 
be now in you unite you shall pass 
pity by i perhaps but not regard 

if this take not I be cheat 

to slip once 
be irrelevant and excuse by humane frailty 
but to fall ever damnable we be both 
guilty I grant in tender our affection 
but as I hope you will do I repent 
when we be grow up to ripeness our life be 
like to this picture while we run 
a constant race in goodness it retain 
the just proportion but the journey be 
tedious and sweet temptation in the way 
that may in some degree divert we from 
the road that we put forth in ere we end 
our pilgrimage it may like this turn yellow 
or be with blackness cloud but when we 
find we have go astray and labour to 
return unto our never fail guide 
virtue contrition with unfeigned feign tear 
the spot of vice wash off will soon restore it 
to the first pureness 

I be disenchant 
mercy oh mercy heaven 

I be ravish with 
what I have see and hard 

let we descend and here 
the rest below 

This have fall out beyond 
my expectation 

how have I wander 
out of the tract of piety and mystical 
by overween pride and flattery 
of fawn sycophant the bane of greatness 
can never meet till now a passenger 
that in his charity will set i right 
or stay i in my precipice to ruin 
how ill have I return your goodness to i 
the horror in my thought oft turn i marble 
but if it may be yet prevent oh sir 
what can I do to show my sorrow or 
with what brow ask your pardon 

pray you rise 

never till you forgive i and receive 
unto your love and favour a change woman 
my state and pride turn to humility henceforth 
shall wait on your command and my obedience 
steer only by your will 

and that will prove 
a second and a better marriage to i all be forget 

sir I must not rise yet 
till with a free confession of a crime 
unknown to you yet and a follow suit 
which thus I beg be grant 

I melt with you 
it be pardon and confirm thus 

know then sir 
in malice to this good knight wife I practise 
Ubaldo and Ricardo to corrupt she 

Thence grow the change of the picture 

and how far 
they have prevail I be ignorant now if you sir 
or the honour of this good man may be entreat 
to travail thither it be but a day journey 
to fetch they off 

we will put on tonight 

ay if you please your harbinger 

I thank you 
let i embrace you in my arm your service 
do on the Turk compare with this weigh nothing 

I be still your humble creature 

my true friend 

and so you be bind to hold he 

such a plant 
import to your kingdom and here graft 
will yield more fruit than all the idle weed 
that suck up your reign of favour 

in my will 
ill not be want prepare for our journey 
in act be my Honoria now not name 
and to all after time preserve thy fame 

be they then so humble 

hunger and hard labour 
have tame they madam at the first they bellow 
like stag take in a toil and will not work 
for sullenness but when they find without it 
there be no eat and that to starve to death 
be much against their stomach by degree 
against their will they fall to it 

and now feed on 
the little pittance you allow with gladness 

I do remember that they stop their nose 
at the sight of beef and mutton as course feed 
for their fine palate but now their work be end 
they leap at a barley crust and hold cheese paring 
with a spoonful of pale wine pour in their water 
for festival exceeding 

when I examine 
my spinster work he tremble like a apprentice 
and take a boy on the care when I spy fault 
and botch in his about as a favour 
from a curse mistress 

the other to reel well 
for his time and if your ladyship will please 
to see they for your sport since they want air 
it will do well in my judgement you shall here 
such a hungry dialogue from they 

but suppose 
when they be out of prison they shall grow 
rebellious 

never fear it ill undertake 
to lead they out by the nose with a course thread 
of the one spin and make the other reel after 
and without grumble and when you be weary of 
their company as easy return they 

dear madam it will help to drive away 
your melancholy 

well on this assurance 
I be content bring they hither 

I will do it 
in stately equipage 

they have confess then 
they be set on by the queen to taint i in 
my loyalty to my lord 

it be the main cause 
that bring they hither 

I be glad I know it 
and as I have begin before I end 
ill at the height revenge it let we step aside 
they come the object so ridiculous 
in spite of my sad thought I can but 
lend a force smile to grace it 

Come away

you will find it in your commons 

commons call you it 
the word be proper I have graze so long 
upon your commons I be almost starve here 

work hard and they shall be better 

better 
worse they can be will I may lie 
like a dog under her table and serve for a footstool 
so I may have my belly full of that 
her island cur refuse 

how do you like 
your air be it not a favour
