or touch of temporal sway have see our face 
in our grave counsel forehead where do stand 
our true glass make by time wrinkle hand 
we know we be old my day proclaim i so 
fortyfive year I have gentle rule this dukedom 
pray heaven it be no fault 
for there be as much disease though not to the eye 
in too much pity as in tyranny 

your grace have speak it right 

I know that life 
have not long course in i it will not be long 
before I show that king have mortal body 
as well as subject therefore to my comfort 
and your successful hope I have a son 
who I dare boast of 

who we all do boast off 
a prince elder in virtue then in year 

his judgement be a father to his youth 

ay ay will he be from court 

our large hope grow in he 

and it be the great pity noble lord 
he be untraveled 

it be indeed my lord 

have he but travail to his time and virtue o he shall never return again 

it shall be so what be in hope begin 
experience quicken travail confirm the man 
who be else life doubtful and his day oft sorry 
who be rich in knowledge have the stock of glory 

most true my royal lord 

some one attend our son 

see here he come my lord 

o you come well 

it be always my desire my worthy father 

your serious study and those fruitful hour 
that grow up into judgement well become 
your birth and all our love I weep that you be my son 
but virtuous I weep the more my gladness 
we have think good and meet by the consent 
of these our noble to move you towards travail 
the better to approve you to yourself 
and give your apt power foundation 
to see affection actual present 
even by those man that owe they yield more profit 
I more content then single to read of they 
since love or fear make writer partial 
the good and free example which you find 
in other country match it with your own 
the ill to shame the ill which will in time 
full instruct you how to set in frame 
a kingdom all in piece 

honour father 
with care and duty I have listen to you 
what you desire in i it be obedience 
I do obey in all know for right 
experience be a kingdom better sight 

o it be the very lustre of a prince 
travail it be sweet and generous 

he that know how to obey know how to reign 
and that true knowledge have we find in you 
make choice of your attendant 

their soone choose only this man my lord a love servant of i 

what none but he 

I do entreat no more 
for that be the benefit a private gentleman 
enjoy beyond our state when he note all 
himself unnoted 
for shall I bear the fashion of a prince 
I shall then win more flattery than profit 
and I shall give they time and warning then 
to hide their action from i if I appear a sun 
they will run into the shade with their ill deed 
and so prevent i 

a little too wise a little too wise to live long 

you have answer we with wisdom let it be 
thing private be best know through privacy 

stay you my elect servant 

my kind lord 

the duke my father have a heavy burden 
of year upon he 

my lord it seem so for they make he stoop 

without dissemblance he be deep in age 
he bow unto his grave I wonder much 
which of his wild nobility it shall be 
for none of his sad counsel have a voice in it 
shall so far travail into his consent 
to set i over into other kingdom 
upon the stroke and minute of his death 

my lord it be easy to suspect they all 
then true to name one 

since it be thus 
by absence I will obey the duke my father 
and yet not wrong myself 

therein my lord 
you may be happy twice 

so it shall be 
I will stay at home and travail 

will your grace 
can make that good 

I can and indeed a prince need no travail far than his own kingdom if he apply himself faithful worthy the glory of himself and expectation of other and it will appear far noble industry in he to reform those fashion that be already in his country than to bring new one in which have neither true form nor fashion to make his court a owl city a ape and the country a wolf prey upon the ridiculous pride of either and therefore I hold it a safe stern upon this lucky advantage since my father be never his set and I upon the eastern hill to take my rise to look into the heart and bowel of this dukedom and in disguise mark all abuse ready for reformation or punishment 

give i but leave unfeigned to admire you 
your wisdom be so spacious and so honest 

so much have the complaint and suit of man seven nay seventeen year neglect still interpose by coin and great enemy prevail with my pity that I can otherwise think but there be infectious deal in most office and foul mystery throughout all profession and therefore I nothing doubt but to find travail enough within myself and experience I fear too much nor will I be curious to fit my body to the humble form and bear so the labour may be fruitful for how can abuse that keep low come to the right view of a prince unless his look lie level with they which else will be long hide from he he shall be the last man see they 
for oft between king eye and subject crime 
stand there a bar of bribe the under office 
flatter he next above it he the next 
and so of most or many every abuse will choose a brother 
it be through the world this hand will rub the other 

you have set down the world brief my lord 

but how be I assure of faith in thou 
yet I dare trust thou 

let my soul be lose 
when it shall lose your secret nor will I only be a preserver of they but if you so please a assister 

it suffice 
that king stand sure who by his virtue rise 
more than by birth or blood that prince be rare 
who strive in youth to save his age from care 
let we be prepare away 

I will follow your grace 
thou wonder of all prince precedent and glory 
true phoenix make of a unusual strain 
who labour to reform be fit to reign 
how can that king be safe that study not 
the profit of his people see where come 
the best part of my heart my love 

sir I be bind to find you I hear new 
of sudden travail which his grace intend 
and only but yourself to accompany he 

you hear in that little beside the truth 
yet not so sudden as to want those manner 
to leave you unregarded 

I do not think so unfashionable of you 
how long be your return 

it be not yet come to i scarce to my lord 
unless the duke refer it to his pleasure 
but long I think it be not the duke age 
if not his apt experience will forbid it 

his grace command I must not think amiss farewell 

nay stay and take this comfort 
you shall hear often from we I will direct 
where you shall sure know and I desire you 
write i the truth how my new father in law the 
captain bear himself towards my mother 
for that marriage know nothing of my mind

be it possible old lad 

I have be a termtrotter myself any time this five and forty year a goodly time and a gracious in which space I have be at least sixteen time beggar and get up again and in the mire again that I have stink again and yet get up again 

and so clean and handsome how 

you see it apparent I can hide it from you nay more in foelice hora be it speak you see I be old yet have I at this present nine and twenty suit in law 

deliver we man 

and all not worth forty shilling 

may it be believe 

the pleasure of a man be all

fie fie 

and I so fetch up all the man every term time that it be impossible to be at civil cuckoldry within ourselves unless the whole country rise upon our wife 

a my faith a pretty policy 

nay a excellent stratagem but of all I most wonder at the continual substance of thy wit that have have so many suit in law from time to time thou have still money to relieve they 

have the best fortune for that I never know he without 

why do you so much wonder at that why this be my course my mare and I come up some five day before a term 

a good decorum 

here I lodge as you see among inn and place of most receipt 

very witty

enough a conscience i'faith 

enough a law no matter for conscience for which busy and laborious sweat courtesy they can choose but feed i with money by which I maintain my own suit ho ho ho 

why let i hug thou caper in my arm 

another special trick I have nobody must know it which be to prefer most of those man to one attorney who I affect best to answer which kindness of i he will sweat the better in my cause and do they the less good take it of my word I help my attorney to more client the last term than he will dispatch all his life time I do it 

what a noble memorable deed be there 

sir 

now sir 

there be a kind of captain very robustious inquire for you 

for i a man of war a man of law be fit for a man of war we have no leisure to say prayer we both kill a Sunday morning I will not be long from your sweet company 

o no I beseech you 

what captain may this be 

thou angel send among we sober law 
make with meek eye persuade action 
no loud immodest tongue voice like a virgin 
and as chaste from sale 
save only to be hear but not to rail 
How have abuse deform thou to all eye 
that where thy virtue sit thy vice rise 
yet why so rash for one villain fault 
do I arraign whole man admire law 
thy upper part must needs be sacred pure 
and incorruptible they be grave and wise 
it be but the dross beneath they and the cloud 
that get between thy glory and their praise 
that make the visible and foul eclipse 
for those that be near to thou be upright 
as noble in their conscience as their birth 
know that damnation be in every bribe 
and rare put it from they rate the presenter 
and scourge they with five year imprisonment 
for off ring but to tempt they 
thus be true justice exercise and use 
woe to the giver when the bribe be refuse 
it be not their will to have law worse than war 
where still the poor die first 
to send a man without a sheet to his grave 
or bury he in his paper 
it be not their mind it shall be nor to have 
a suit hang long than a man in chain 
let he be never so fasten they least know 
that be above the tedious step below 
I thank my time I do 

I long to know what captain this shall be 

see where the bane or every cause return 

'sfoot it be the captain my father in law my L 

take heed 

the divorce shall rest then and the five hundred crown shall stand in full force and virtue 

then do you wise captain 

a way sail I fare thou well 

a lusty crack or wind go with thou 

but ah 

hah 

Remember a scrivener 

I will have he for thou why thus be I seek after by all profession here be a weather beat captain who not long since new marry to a lady widow will now fain have sue a divorce between she and he but that her honesty be his only hindrance to be rid of which he do determine to turn she into white money and there be a lord his chapman have bid five hundred crown for she already 

how 

or for his part or whole in she 

why do she leave to sell his wife 

his wife i by the mass he will sell his soul if he know what merchant will lay out money upon it and some of they have need of one they swear so fast 

why I never hear of the like 

Non audivisti do never here of that trick why Pistor a baker sell his wife other day to a cheesemonger that make cake and cheese another to a cofferer a three to a common player why you see it be common never fear the captain be have not so much wit to be a president himself I promise to furnish he with a odd scrivener of my own to draw the bargain and sale of his lady your horse stand here gentleman 

ay ay I 

I shall be busy plunge till towards bed time above the chin in profundis 

what monstrous day be these 
not only to be vicious most man study 
but in it to be ugly strive to exceed 
each other in the most deform deed 

be this her private choice do she neglect 
the presence and opinion of her friend for this 

I wonder who that one shall be 
shall so disgrace that reverend name of lord 
so loathsome to buy adultery 

we may make mean to know 

take courage man we will beget some defence 

I be bind by nature

therefore no more this combat choose 
where he that win do always lose 
and those that gain all with this curse receive it 
from fool they get it to their son they leave it 

Haile sacred patience I begin to feel 
I have a conscience now truth in my word compassion in my heart and above all in my blood peace music

thus when all heart be tune to honour string 
there be no music to the choir of king
