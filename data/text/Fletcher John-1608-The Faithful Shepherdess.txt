though the great danger betwixt my hope and that

down by the more who life have ever show 
more sullen discontent than Saturn brow

and never joy unless it be in break 
the holy plight troth of mutual soul 
one that lust after every several beauty 
but never yet be know to love or like 
be the face fair or more full of truth 
than Phoebe in her fullness or the youth 
of smooth Lyeus who nigh starve flock

they feed withal who lamb be ever last 
and die before their wean and who dog 
look like his master lean and full of scurf 
not care for the pipe or whistle this man may

be compass by the wit or art of man 
and if I fail in my performance may

then thus I try thou shepherd this same night 
that now come steal on a gentle pair 
have promise equal love and do appoint 
to make yond wood the place where hand and heart 
be to be tie for ever break their meeting 
and their strong faith and I be ever thou

by my great power the centre of their love 
from his sixth be let i never more 
warm i by those fair eye I thus adore 

Come as we go I will tell thou what they be 
and give thou fit direction for thy work exeunt 
how have I wrong the time or man that thus 
after this holy feast I pass unknown 
and unsaluted it be not wont to be 
thus freeze with the young company 
of jolly shepherd it be not then hold good 
for lusty groom to mix their quick blood 
with that dull humour most unfit to be 
the friend of man cold and dull chastity 
sure I be hold not fair or be too old 
or else not free enough or from my foul 
drive not a flock sufficient great to gain 
the greedy eye of wealth allure swain 
yet if I may believe what other say 
my face have foil enough nor can they lay 
just too strict a coyness to my charge 
my flock be many and the down as large 
they feed upon then let it ever be 
their coldness not my virgin modesty 
make i complain 

be ever man but I 
thus true take with uncertainty 
where shall that man be find that love a mind 
make up in constancy and dare not find 
his love reward here let all man know 
a wretch that live to love his mistress so 

shepherd I pray thou stay where haste thou be 
or whether go thou here be wood as green 
as any air as fresh and sweet 
as where smooth Zephyrus play on the fleet 
face of the curl stream with flower as many 
as the young spring give and as choice as any 
here be all new delight cool stream and well 
arbour be grow with wood bine cave and dell 
choose where thou will while I sit by and sing 
or gather rush to make many a ring 
for thy long finger tell thou tale of love 
how the pale Phoebe hunt in a grove 
first see the boy Endymion from who eye 
she take eternal fire that never die 
how she convey he soft in a sleep 
his temple bind with poppy to the steep 
head of old Latmus where she stoop each night 
gild the mountain with her brother light 
to kiss her sweet 

far from i be these 
hot flash breed from wanton heat and ease 
I have forget what love and love mean 
rhyme song and merry round that oft be send 
to the soft ear of maid be strange to i 
only I live to admire a chastity 
that neither please age smooth tongue or gold 
can ever break upon so sure the mould 
be that her mind be cast in it be to she 
I only be reserve she be my form I stir 
by breath and move it be she and only she 
can make i happy or give misery 

good shepherd may a stranger crave to know 
to who this dear observance you do owe 

you may and by her virtue learn to square 
and level out your life for to be fair 
and nothing virtuous only fit the eye 
of gaudy youth and swell vanity 
then know she be call the virgin of the grove 
she that have long since bury her chaste love 
and now live by his grave for who dear soul 
she have vow herself into the holy role 
of strict virginity it be her I so admire 
not any loose blood or new desire 

farewell poor swain thou be not for my bend 
I must have quick soul who word may tend 
to some free action give i he dare love 
at first encounter and as soon dare prove 
Come shepherd come 
come away without delay 
while the gentle time do stay 
green wood be dumb 
and will never tell to any 
those dear kiss and those many 
sweet embrace that be give 
dainty pleasure that will even 
raise in cold age a fire 
and give virgin blood desire 
then if ever 
now or never 
come and have it 
think not I 
dare deny 
if you crave it enter Daphnis 
here come another better be my speed 
thou god of blood but certain if I read 
not false this be that modest shepherd he 
that only dare salute but never can be 
bring to kiss any hold discourse or sing 
whisper or bold ask that wish thing 
we all be bear for one that make love face 
and can be well content to covet grace 
be they not get by boldness in this thing 
my hope be freeze and but fate do bring 
he hither I will soon choose 
a man make out of snow and free use 
a eunuch to my end but since he be here 
thus I attempt he thou of man most dear 
welcome to she that only for thy sake 
have be content to live here bold take 
my hand in pledge this hand that never yet 
be give away to any and but sit 
down on this rushy bank while I go pull 
fresh blossom from the bow or quick cull 
the choice delicate from yonder mead 
to make thou chain or chaplet or to spread 
under our faint body when delight 
shall lock up all our sense how the sight 
of those smooth rise cheek renew the story 
of young Adonis when in pride and glory 
he lie enfold betwixt the beat arm 
of willing Venus methinks strong charm 
dwell in those speak eye and on that brow 
more sweetness than the painter can allow 
to their best piece not Narcissus he 
that weep himself away in memory 
of his own beauty nor Silvanus boy 
nor the twice ravish maid for who old Troy 
fall by the hand of Pyrrhus may to thou 
be otherwise compare then some dead tree 
to a young fruitful olive 

I can love but I be loath to say so lest I prove 
too soon unhappy 

happy thou will say 
my dear Daphnis blush not if the day 
to thou and thy soft heat be enemy 
then take the come night fair youth it be free 
to all the world shepherd I will meet thou then 
when darkness have shut up the eye of man 
in yonder grove speak shall our meeting hold 
Indeed you be too bashful be more bold 
and tell i I 

I be content to say so 
and will be glad to meet may I but pray so 
much from your fairness that you will be true 

Shepheard thou have thy wish 

fresh maid adieu 
yet one word more since you have draw i on 
to come this night fear not to meet alone 
that man that will not offer to be ill 
though your bright self will ask it for his fill 
of this world goodness do not fear he then 
but keep your point time let other man 
set up their blood to sail i shall be ever 
fair as the soul it carry and unchaste never exit 

yet be I poor than I be before 
be it not strange among so many a score 
of lusty blood I shall pick out these thing 
who vein like a dull river far from spring 
be still the same slow heavy and unfit 
for stream or motion though the strong wind hit 
with their continual power upon his side 
o happy be your name that have be bride 
and taste those rare sweet for which I pine 
and far more heavy be thy grief and tine 
thou lazy swain that may relieve my need 
than his upon who liver always feed 
a hungry vulture enter Alexis 

can such beauty be 
safe in his own guard and not draw the eye 
of he that pass on to greedy gaze 
or covetous desire while in a maze 
the better part contemplate give rain 
and wish freedom to the labour vain 
fair and white may I crave to know 
the cause of your retirement why you go 
thus all alone methinks the down be sweet 
and the young company of swain more meet 
than these forsake and untrodden place 
give not yourself to loneness and those grace 
hide from the eye of man that be intend 
to live among we swain 

thou be befriend 
shepherd in all my life I have not see 
a man in who great content have be 
than thou thyself be I can tell thou more 
be there but any hope leave to restore 
my freedom lose o lend i all thy red 
thou shamefast morning when from Tithonus bed 
thou rise ever maiden 

if for i 
thou sweet of all sweet these flash be 
speak and be satisfy o guide her tongue 
my better angel force my name among 
her modest thought that the first word may be 

Alexis when the sun shall kiss the sea 
take his rest by the white Thetis side 
meet in the holy wood where I will abide 
thy come shepherd 

if I stay behind 
a everlasting dulness and the wind 
that as he pass by shut up the stream 
of Rhine or Volga while the sun hot beam 
beat back again cease i and let i turn 
to coldness more than ice o how I burn 
and rise in youth and fire I dare not stay exit 

my name shall be your word 

fly fly thou day 

my grief be great if both these boy shall fail 
he that will use all wind must shift his sail Exit 

shepherd all and maiden fair 
fold your flock up for the air 
begin to thicken and the sun 
already his great course have run 
see the dew drop how they kiss 
every little flower that be 
hang on their velvet head 
like a rope of crystal bead 
see the heavy cloud loud fall 
and bright Hesperus down call 
the dead night from under ground 
at who rise mist unsound 
damp and vapour fly apace 
hover over the wanton face 
of these pasture where they come 
strike dead both bud and bloom 
therefore from such danger lock 
every one his love flock 
and let your dog lie loose without 
lest the wolf come as a scout 
from the mountain and ere day 
bear a lamb or kid away 
or the crafty thievish fox 
break upon your simple flock 
to secure yourselves from these 
be not too secure in ease 
let one eye his watch keep 
while the other eye do sleep 
so you shall good shepherd prove 
and for ever hold the love 
of our great God sweet slumber 
and soft silence fall in number 
on your eyelid so farewell 
thus I end my evenings knell exeunt 
now let i know what my best art have do 
help by the great power of the virtuous moon 
in her full light o you son of earth 
you only brood unto who happy birth 
virtue be give hold more of nature 
than man her first bear and most perfect creature 
let i adore you you that only can 
help or kill nature draw out that span 
of life and breath even to the end of time 
you that these hand do crop long before prime 
of day give i your name and next your hide power 
this be the Clote bear a yellow flower 
and this black whorehound both be very good 
for sheep or shepherd bite by a wood 
dog venomed tooth these Ramun branch be 
which stick in entry or about the bar 
that hold the door fast kill all the enchantment charm 
be they Medea verse that do harm 
to man or cattle these for frenzy be 
a speedy and a sovereign remedy 
the bitter wormwood sage and marigold 
such sympathy with man good they do hold 
this Tormentil who virtue be to part 
all deadly kill poison from the heart 
and here Narcissus root for swell best 
yellow Lecimacus to give sweet rest 
to the faint shepherd kill where it come 
all busy gnat and every fly that hum 
for leprosy Darnell and sellondine 
with Calamint who virtue do refine 
the blood of man make it free and fair 
as the first hour it breathe or the best air 
here other to but your rebellious use 
be not form who goodness be abuse 
therefore foul standergrass from i and i 
I banish thou with lustful turpentine 
you that entice the vein and stir the heat 
to civil mutiny scale the seat 
our reason move in and delude it 
with dream and wanton fancy till the fit 
of burn lust be quench by appetite 
rob the soul of blessedness and light 
and thou light vermin to thou must go after 
provoke easy soul to mirth and laughter 
no more shall I dip thou in water now 
and sprinkle every post and every bow 
with thy well please juice to make the groom 
swell with high mirth as with joy all the room 

this be the cabin where the best of all 
her sex that ever breathe or ever shall 
give heat or happiness to the shepherd side 
do only to her worthy self abide 
thou bless star I thank thou for thy light 
thou by who power the darkness of sad night 
be banish from the earth in who dull place 
thy chaste beam play on the heavy face 
of all the world make the blue sea smile 
to see how cunning thou do beguile 
thy brother of his brightness give day 
again from Chaos white than that way 
that lead to jove high court and chaste far 
than chastity itself yond bless star 
that nightly shine thou all the constancy 
that in all woman be or ere shall be 
from who fair eyeball fly that holy fire 
that port style the mother of desire 
infuse into every gentle breast 
a soul of great price and far more bless 
than that quick power which give a difference 
betwixt man and creature of a low sense 

Shepheard how come thou hither to this place 
no way be tread all the verdant grass 
the spring shoot up stand yet unbruised here 
of any foot only the dappled deer 
far from the fear sound of crooked horn 
dwell in this fastness 

chaste than the morn 
I have not wander or by strong illusion 
into this virtuous place have make intrusion 
but hither be I come believe i fair 
to seek you out of who great good the air 
be full and strong labor while the sound 
break against heaven and drive into a stround 
the amaze shepherd that such virtue can 
be resident in lesser than a man 

if any art I have or hide skill 
may cure thou of disease or fester ill 
who grief or greenness to another eye 
may seem unpossible of remedy 
I dare yet undertake it 

it be no pain 
I suffer through disease no beat vain 
convey infection dangerous to the heart 
no part impostume to be cure by art 
this body hold and yet a fell grief 
than ever skilful hand do give relief 
dwell on my soul and may be heal by you 
fair beauteous virgin 

then shepherd let i sue 
to know thy grief that man yet never know 
the way to health that dare not show his sore 

then fair know I love you 

swain no more 
thou have abuse the strictness of this place 
and offer sacrilegious foul disgrace 
to the sweet rest of these inter bone 
for fear of who ascend fly at once 
thou and thy idle passion that the sight 
of death and speedy vengeance may not fright 
thy very soul with horror 

let i not 
thou all perfection merit such a blot 
for my true zealous faith 

dare thou abide 
to see this holy earth at once divide 
and give her body up for sure it will 
if thou pursue with wanton flame to fill 
this hallow place therefore repent and go 
while I with pray appease his ghost below 
that else will tell thou what it be to be 
a rival in that virtuous love that he 
embrace yet 

it be not the white or red 
inhabit in your cheek that thus can wed 
my mind to adoration nor your eye 
though it be full and fair your forehead high 
and smooth as Pelops shoulder not the smile 
lie watch in those dimple to beguile 
the easy soul your hand and finger long 
with vein enamel rich nor your tongue 
though it speak sweet than Arion harp 
your hair weave into many a curious warp 
able in endless error to unfold 
the wander soul not the true perfect mould 
of all your body which as pure do show 
in maiden whiteness as the Alpsian snow 
all these be but your constancy away 
will please i less than a black stormy day 
the wretched seaman toil through the deep 
but while this honour strictness you dare keep 
though all the plague that ere beget be 
in the great womb of air be settle here 
in opposition I will like the tree 
shake off those drop of weakness and be free 
even in the arm of danger 

will thou have 
i raise again fond man from silent grave 
those spark that long ago be bury here 
with my dead friend cold ash 

dear dear 
I dare not ask it nor you must not grant 
stand strong to your vow and do not faint 
remember how he love you and be still 
the same opinion speak you let not will 
and that great god of weave appetite 
set up your blood again do not invite 
desire and fancy for their long exile 
to seat they once more in a please smile 
be like a rock make firm up against all 
the power of angry heaven or the strong fall 
of Neptune battery if you yield I die 
to all affection it be that loyalty 
you tie unto this grave I so admire 
and yet there be something else I will desire 
if you will hear i but withal deny 
oh pan what a uncertain destiny 
hang over all my hope I will retire 
for if I long stay this double fire 
will lick my life up 

do and let time wear out 
what art and nature can bring about 

farewell thou soul of virtue and be bless 
for ever while I wretched rest 
thus to myself yet grant i leave to dwell 
in ken of this arbour yond same dell 
over top with mourn cypress and sad ewe 
shall be my cabin where I will early rue 
before the sun have kiss this dew away 
the hard uncertain chance which fate do lay 
upon this head 

the god give quick release 
and happy cure unto thy hard disease exeunt 

I do not love this wench that I shall meet 
for never do my unconstant eye yet greet 
that beauty be it sweet or more fair 
than the new blossom when the morning air 
blow gentle on they or the break light 
when many maiden blush to our sight 
shoot from his early face be all these set 
in some neat form before i it will not get 
the least love from i some desire it may 
or present burn all to i in sight 
be equal be they fair or black or brown

be private and out of the common trace 
of every shepherd for I understand

then bold here where we shall never be find 
no shepherd way lie here it be hallow ground 
no maid seek here her stray cow or sheep 
fairy and fawn and satire do it keep

and let no fear make we our pleasure miss 

then lie by i the soon we begin 
the long ere day descry our sin

the great power that shepherd dare to name 
here where thou first under this holy tree 
she to dishonour thou shall bury be 

if pan himself shall come out of the lawn 
with all his troop of satyr and of faun 
and bid i leave I swear by she two eye

and the star who feeble light

in a corner of the wood 
where never mortal foot have stand 
keep dance music and a feast 
to entertain a lovely guest 
where he give her many a rose 
sweet than the breath that blow 
the leaf grape berry of the best 
I never see so great a feast 
but to my charge here must I stay 
to see what mortal lose their way 
and by a false fire seem bright 
train they in and leave they right 
then must I watch if any be 
force of a chastity 
if I find it then in haste 
give my wreathe horn a blast 
and the fairy all will run 
wild dance by the moon 
and will pinch he to the bone 
till his lustful thought be go 

o death 

back again about this ground 
sure I hear a mortal sound 
I bind thou by this powerful spell 
by the water of this well

will help this mortal wight to cure 

since I behold you shaggy man my breast 
do pant each bush methinks shall hide a beast 
yet my desire keep still above my fear 
I will fain meet some shepherd know I where 
for from one cause of fear I be most free

though he be hurt I furnish be of one 
but now both lose Alexis speak or move 
if thou have any life thou be yet my love

creep from the bank for fear of that ill spirit 
then where be thou that strike my love o stray

with flower and garland that be mean for he 
I will clip thou round with both my arm as fast 
as I do mean he shall have be embrace 
but thou be flee what hope be leave for i 
I will run to Daphnis in the hollow tree 
who I do mean to mock though hope be small 
to make he bold rather than none at all 
I will try he his heart and my behaviour to

this be the place it be but my feeble sight 
mix with the horror of my deed a night 
that shape these fear and make i run away 
and lose my beauteous hardly get pray 
speak gentle shepherdess I be alone 
and tender love for love but she be go 
from i that have strike her lover dead 
for silly fear leave she a lone and flee 
and see the wound body be remove

with subtle Amarillis in the shape 
of Amoretta pray love he may not escape

let he not guard my flock let fox tear

I dote upon thou more than that young lamb 
do on the bag that feed he from his dam 
were there a sort of wolf get in my foul 
and one run after thou both young and old 
shall be devour and it shall be my strife 
to save thou who I love above my life 

how shall I trust thou when I see thou choose 
another bed and do my side refuse

twixt thou and i although we be alone 

Come Perigot will show his power that he

if thou be a virgin pure 
I can give a present cure 
take a droop into thy wound 
from my watery lock more round 
then orient pearl and far more pure 
then unchaste flesh may endure 
see she pant and from her flesh

and betwixt two bank with osier set 
that only prosper in the wet 
through the meadow do they glide 
wheel still on every side 
sometime wind round about 
to find the even channel out 
and if thou will go with i 
leave mortal company 
in the cool stream shall thou lie 
free from harm as well as I 
I will give thou for thy food 
no fish that use in the mud 
but trout and pike that love to swim 
where the gravel from the brim 
though the pure stream may be seen 
orient pearl fit for a queen 
will I give thy love to win 
and a shell to keep they in 
not a fish in all my brook 
that shall disobey thy look 
but when thou will come slide by 
and from thy white hand take a fly 
and to make thou understand 
how I can my wave command 
they shall bubble while I sing 
sweet than the silver string

I know myself unworthy to be woo 
by the a god for ere this but for thou 
I shall have show my weak mortality 
beside by holy oath betwixt we twain 
I be betroth unto a shepherd swain 
who comely face I know the god above 
may make i leave to see but not to love

fair virgin now adieu 
I must make my water fly 
lest they leave their channel dry 
and beast that come unto the spring 
miss their morning watering 
which I will not for of late 
all the neighbour people sit 
one my bank and from the fold 
tow white lamb of three week old 
offer to my deity 
for which this year they shall be free 
from rage flood that as they pass 
leave their gravel in the grass 
nor shall their mead be over fly 
when their grass be new moan 

for thy kindness to i show 
never from thy bank be blow 
any tree with windy force 
cross thy stream to stop thy course 
may no beast that come to drink 
with his horn cast down thy brink 
may non that for thy fish do look 
cut thy bank to dam thy brook 
barefoot may no neighbour wade 
in thy cool stream wife nor maid 
when the spawn one stone do lie 
to wash their hemp and spoil the fry 

thank virgin I must down again 
thy wound will put thou to no pain

she be go she be go blow high thou north west wind 
and raise the sea to mountain let the tree 
that dare oppose thy rage fury lose 
their firm foundation creep into the earth 
and shake the world as at the monstruous birth 
of some new prodigy while I constant stand 
hold this trusty boarspear in my hand 
and fall thus upon it 
stay thy dead do hand thou be too hot 
against thyself believe i comely swain 
if that thou die not all the shower of rain 
the heavy cloud send down can wash away 
the foul unmanly guilt the world will lay 
upon thou yet thy love untainted stand

and all those lesser light our eye do view

with many worse companion but o death 
I be not yet enamour of his breath 
so much but I dare leave it it be not pain 
in force of a wound nor after gain 
of many day can hold i from my will 
it be not myself but Amoretta bid kill 

stay but a little little but on hour 
and if I do not show thou through the power 
of herb and word I have as dark as night

with tawny buskin and thou hook she bear 
of thy own carve where your name be set 
wrought underneath with many a curious fret

thou give she for her sing with each thing 
else that she wear about she let i feel 
the first tell stroke of that revenge steel 

I be content if there be a hope 
to give it entertainment for the scope 
of one poor hour go you shall find i next 
under you shady beech even thus perplex 
and thus believe 

Bind before I go 
thy soul by pan unto i not to do 
harm or outrageous wrong upon thy life 
till my return 

by pan and by the strife 
he have with Phoebus for the mastery 
when golden Midas judge their minstrelsy 
I will not exeunt 

soft glide as I go 
with this burden full of woe 
through still silence of the night 
guide by the glowworm light 
hither be I come at last 
many a thicket have I pass 
not at twig that dare deny i 
nor a bush that dare descry i 
to the little bird that sleep 
on the tender spray nor creep 
that hardly worm with point tail 
but if I be under sail 
fly fast than the wind 
leave all the cloud behind 
but do hide her tender head 
in some hollow tree or bed 
of seed nettle not a hare 
can be start from his fare 
by my foot nor a wish 
be more sudden nor a fish 
can be find with great ease 
cut the vast unbounded sea 
leave neither print nor sound 
then I when nimble on the ground 
I measure many a league a hour 
but behold the happy bower 
that must ease i of my charge 
and by holy hand enlarge 
the soul of this sad man that yet 
lie fast bind in deadly fit 
heaven and great pan sucker it 
hail thou beauty of the bower 
whither then the paramour 
of my master let i crave 
thy virtuous help to keep from grave 
this poor mortal that here lie 
wait when thou destiny 
will undo his thread of life 
view the wound by cruel knife 
trench into he 

what be thou call i from my holy right 
and with the fear name of death a fright 
my tender ear speak i thy name and will 

I be the satyr that do fill 
your lap with early fruit and will 
when I hap to gather more 
bring you better and more store 
yet I come not empty now 
see a blossom from the bow 
but be shrew his heart that pull it 
and his perfect sight that cull it 
from the other spring bloom 
for a sweet youth the gwomes 
can show i nor the down 
nor the many neighbour town 
low in yonder glade I find he 
soft in my arm I bind he 
hither have I bring he sleep 
in a trance his wound fresh weep 
in remembrance such youth may 
spring and perish in a day 

satire they wrong thou that do term thou rude 
though thou be outward rough and tawny hue 
thy manner be as gentle and as fair 
as his who brag himself bear only heir 
to all humanity let i see thy wound 
this herb will stay the currant be bind 
fast to the orifice and this restrain 
ulcer and swelling and such inward pain 
as the cold air have force into the sore 
this to draw out such putrefying gore 
as inward fall 

heaven grant it may do good 

fair wipe away the blood 
hold he gentle till I fling 
water of a virtuous spring 
on his temple turn he twice 
to the moon beam pinch he thrice 
that the labour soul may draw 
from his great eclipse 

I see 
his eyelid move 

give he breath 
all the danger of cold death 
now be vanish with this plaster 
and this unction do I master 
all the fester ill that may 
give he grief another day 

see he gather up his spirit 
and begin to hunt for light 
now he gape and breathe again 
how the blood run to the vain 
that east be imply 

o my heart 
my dear dear Cloe oh the smart 
run through my side I feel some point thing 
pass through my bowel sharp than the sting 
of scorpion 
pan preserve i what be you 
do not hurt i I be true 
to my Cloe though she fly 
and leave i to this destiny 
there she stand and will not lend 
her smooth white hand to help her friend 
but I be much mistake for that face 
bear more austerity and modest grace 
more reprove and more awe 
then these eye yet ever see 
in my Cloe o my pain 
eager renew again 
give i your help for his sake you love best 

shepherd thou can not possible take rest 
till thou have lay a side all heat desire

and I shall undertake your cure with ease 
till when this virtuous plaster will displease 
your tender side give i your hand and rise

they best feel it that do find it 

Come bring he in I will attend his sore

by my head it be better miss 
bright if there be remain

to catch the nimble wind or get 
shadow glide on the green 
or to steal from the great queen 
of fairy all her beauty 
I will do it so much duty 
do I owe those precious eye 

I thank the honest satire if the cry 
of any other that be hurt or ill 
draw thou unto they prithee do thy will 
to bring they hither 

I will and when the weather 
serve to angle in the brook 
I will bring a silver hook 
with a line of fine silk 
and a rod as white as milk 
to deserve the little fish 
so I take my leave and wish 
on this bower may ever dwell 
spring and summer

stoop to the melt of a borrow brow 

then hear i heaven to who I call for right 
and you fair twinkle star that crown the night 
and hear i wood and and silence of this place 
and you sad hour that move a sullen pace 
hear i you shadow that delight to dwell 
in horrid darkness and you power of hell 
while I breathe out my last I be that maid 
that yet untainted Amoretta that play 
the careless prodigal and give away 
my soul to this young man that now dare say 
I be a stranger not the same more wild 
and thus with much belief I be beguile 
I be that maid that have delay deny 
and almost scorn the love of all that try 
to win i but this swain and yet confess 
I have be woo by many with no less 
soul of affection and have often have 
ring belt and cracknel send i from the lad 
that feed his flock down westward lamb and dove 
by young Alexis Daphnis send i glove

that send they do I smile one or ere lay 
up to my after memory but why 
do I resolve to grieve and not to die 
happy have be the stroke thou give if home 
by this time have I find a quiet room 
where every slave be free and every breast 
that live bread new care now lie at rest 
and thither will poor Amoretta

his eye as I or be there ever yet 
any so like as this to Amoretta 
for who dear sake I promise if there be 
a live soul within thou thus to free 
thy body from it he hurl she again 

so this work have end 
farewell and live be constant to thy friend 
that love thou next 

see the day begin to break 
and the light shut like a streak 
of subtle fire the wind blow cold 
while the morning do unfold 
now the bird begin to rouse 
and the squirrel from the bough 
leap to get he nut and fruit 
the early lark erst be mute 
carol to the rise day 
many a note and many lie 
therefore here I end my watch 
lest the wander swain shall catch 
harm or lose he amo self ah i

by the dawn of the day 
by the power of night and pan 
I enforce thou speak again

can there be a hand or heart 
dare commit so vild a part 
as this murder by the moon 
that hide herself when this be do

I will bear she to the place 
where my goddess keep and crave 
she to give her life or grave 

here while one patient take his rest secure 
I steal a broad to do another cure

that from thy side I dare so soon remove 
I will not prove unconstant nor will leave 
thou for a hour alone when I deceive 
my first make vow the wild of the wood

I go by wit to cure a lover pain 
which no herb can be do I will come again exit 
poor shepherd in this shade for ever lie 
and see thy fair Clorin cabin die 
oh hapless love which be answer end 
and as a little infant cry and bend 
his tender brow when roll of his eye 
he have espy some thing that glister nigh 
which he will have yet give it he away 
he throw it straight and cry a fresh to play 
with some thing else such my affection set 
on that which I shall loathe if I can get 
see where he lie do ever man but he 
love any woman for her constancy 
to her dead lover which she needs must end 
before she can allow he for her friend 
and he himself must needs the cause destroy 
for which he love before he can enjoy 
poor shepherd heaven grant I at once may free 
thou from thy pain and keep my loyalty 
shepherd look up 

thy brightness do amaze 
so Phoebus may at noon bid mortal gaze 
thy glorious constancy appear so bright 
I dare not meet the beam with my weak sight 

why do thou pine away thyself for i 

why do thou keep such spotless constancy 

thou holy shepherd see what for thy sake 
Clorin thy Clorin now dare undertake he start up 

stay there thou constant Clorin if there be 
yet any part of woman leave in thou 
to make thou light think yet before thou speak 

see what a holy vow for thou I break 
I that already have my fame far spread 
for be constant to my lover dead

if you have die he will have be to you

think but how bless 
a constant woman be above the rest 

and offer up myself here on this ground 
to be dispose by thou 

why do thou wound 
his heart with malice against woman more 
that hate all the sex but thou before 
how much more pleasant have it be to i 
to die than behold this change in thou 
yet yet return let not the woman sway 

Insult not on she now nor use delay

I hate thou now yet turn 

be just to i 
shall I at once lose both my fame and thou 

thou have no fame that which thou do like good 
be but thy appetite that sway thy blood 
for that time to the best for as a blast 
that through a house come usual do cast 
thing out of order yet by chance may come 
and blow some one thing to his proper room 
so do thy appetite and not thy zeal 
sway they by chance to do some one thing well 
yet turn 

thou do but try i if I will 
forsake thy dear embrace for my old 
love though he be alive but do not fear 

I do contemn thou now and dare come near 
and gaze upon thou for methinks that grace 
austerity which sit upon that face 
be go and thou like other false maid see 
this be the gain of foul inconstance exit 

it be do great pan I give thou thanks for it 
what art can not have heal be cure by wit 
will you be constant yet will you remove 
into the cabin to your bury love 

no let i die but by thy side remain 

there be none shall know that thou do ever stain 
thy worthy strictness but shall honour be 
and I will lie again under this tree 
and pine and die for thou with more delight 
than I have sorrow now to know thou light 

let i have thou and I will be where thou will 

thou be of woman race and full of guilt 
farewell all hope of that sex while I think 
there be one good I fear to find one nought 
but since there mind I all alike espy 
hence forth I will choose as they by my eye 

bless be you power that give such quick redress 
and for my labour send so good success 
I rather choose though I a woman be 
he shall speak ill of all 
then die for i

through the window while the Sun 
to the mountain top be run 
gild all the vale below 
with his rise flame which grow 
great by his climb still 
up you lazy groom and fill 
bag and bottle for the field 
clasp your cloak fast lest they yield 
to the bitter Northeast wind 
call the maiden up and find 
who lie long that she may 
go without a friend all day 
then reward your dog and prey 
pan to keep you from decay 
so unfold and then away 
what not a shepherd stir sure the groom 
have find their bed too easy or the room 
fill with such new delight and heat that they 
have both forget their hungry sheep and day 
knock that they may remember what a shame 
sloth and neclect lay on a shepherd name 

it be to little purpose not a swain 
this night have know his lodging here or lie 
within these coat the wood or some near town 
that be a neighbour to the border down 
have draw they thither about some lusty sport 
or spice wassail bowl to which resort 
all the young man and maid of many a coat 
while the trim minstrel strike his merry note 

God pardon sin show i the way that lead 
to any of their haunt 

This to the mead 
and that down to the wood 

then this for i

that bear i thus a way drown in my blood 
And die know I can injure be

fair virgin do not fear 
i that do thy body bear 
not to hurt but hold to be

some savage man have strike her breast 
so soft and white that no wild beast 
dare a touch asleep or wake 
so sweet that adder newt or snake 
will have lay from arm to arm 
on her bosom to be warm 
all a night and be hot

with spotless hand on spotless breast 
I put these herb to give thou rest 
which till it heal they there will bide

why that have bring it 

for aught I know or think these word my last 
yet pan so help i as my thought be chaste 

and so may pan bless this my cure 
as all my thought be just and pure 
some uncleanness nigh do lurk 
that will not let my medicine work 
satire search if thou can find it 

here away methinks I wind it 
strong yet o here they be 
here here in a hollow tree 
two fond mortal have I find

by the finger thus I wring you 
to my goddess thus I bring you

I scent they they be full of sin 

hold satire take this glass 
sprinkle over all the place 
purge the air from lustful breath 
to save this shepherdess from death 
and stand you still while I do dress 
her wound for fear the pain increase 

from this glass I throw a drop 
of crystal water on the top 
of every grass on flower a pair 
send a fume and keep the air 
pure and wholesome sweet and bless 
till this virgin wound be dress

Shepheard come 

my thought be pure 
the better trial to endure 

in this flame his finger thrust 

which will burn he if he lust 
but if not away will turn 
as loath unspotted flesh to burn 
see it give back let he go 
farewell mortal keep thou so 

stay fair nymph fly not so fast 
we must try if yond be chaste 
here be a hand that quake for fear 
sure she will not prove so clear

to keep the piercing air away 

sure they be lose for ever it be in vain 
to find they out with trouble and much pain 
that have a ripe desire and forward will 
to fly the company of all but ill 
what shall be counsel now shall we retire 
or constant follow still that first desire 
we have to find they 

stay a little while 
for if the morning mist do not beguile 
my sight with shadow sure I see a swain 
one of this jolly troop come back again 

do thou not blush young shepherd to be know 
thus without care leave thy flock alone 
and follow what desire and present blood 
shape out before thy burn sense for good 
have forget what tongue hereafter may 
tell to the world thy fall off and say 
thou be regardless both of good and shame 
spurn at virtue and a virtuous name 
and like a glorious desperate man that buy 
a poison of much price by which he die 
do thou lay out for lust who only gain 
be foul disease with present age and pain 
and then a grave these be the fruit that grow 
in such hot vein that only beat to know 
where they may take most ease and grow ambitious 
through their own wanton fire and pride delicious 

right holy sir I have not know this night 
what the smooth face of mirth be or the sight 
of any looseness music joy and ease 
have be to i as bitter drug to please 
a stomach lose with weakness not a game 
that I be skill at thorough nor a dame 
go she tongue smooth than the foot of time 
her bevy ever live like the rhyme 
our bless Tityrus do sing of yore 
no be she more entice than the store 
of fruitful summer when the load tree 
bid the faint traveller be bold and free 
it be but to i like thunder against the bay 
who lightning may enclose but never stay 
upon his charm branch such be I 
against the catching flame of woman eye 

then wherefore have thou wander 

it be a vow 
that draw i out last night which I have now 
strict perform and homeward go to give 
fresh pasture to my sheep that they may live 

it be good to hear you shepherd if the heart 
in this well sound music bear his part 
where have you leave the rest 
I have not see 
since yesternight we meet upon this green 
to foul our flock up any of that train 
yet have I walk these wood round and have lie 
all this long night under a age tree 
yet neither wander shepherd do I see 
or shepherdess or draw into my ear 
the sound of live thing unless it be
