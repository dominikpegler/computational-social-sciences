lo gentle thus the lord do London guard 
not for my sake but for his own delight 
for all in vain the sentinel watch and ward 
except he keep the city day and night 
now may my foe in vain both spurn and spite 
my foe I mean that London represent 
guard from heaven by angel excellent 
this blessing be not my sole benefit 
all England be and so preserve have be 
not by man strength his policy and wit 
but by a power and providence unseen 
Even for the love wherewith God love our queen 
in who for who by who we do possess 
more grace more good than London can express 
and that have breed our plenty and our peace 
and they do breed the sport you come to see 
and joy it be that I enjoy increase 
my former fruit be lovely lady three 
now of three lord to talk be London glee 
who deed I wish may to your like frame 
for London bid you welcome to the same 

here I advance my shield and hang it up 
to challenge he whoever dare deny 
that one of those three London lady rare 
ought not of right be match with policy 
a London lord the which I represent 
Pom and pomp provide his challenge in his word 
glory sans peer claim the one of they 
not by compulsion but by common right 
yet maugre man my shield be here advance 
for one matchless a London lady best 
beseem pomp a London lord to have 

pleasure have soar as do his impreze show 
to look aloof on earthly lady all 
yet never can my curious eye discern 
a dame of worth for London pleasure love 
but one and she do shine as silver dove 
of self breed soil of London be her race 
for who in challenge I my shield advance 

thus each in honour of his mistress 
and in regard of he well dare mind 
have here emprise the challenge of his right 
but lording both and brethren breed and swear 
a caution must be have in this conceit 
that all our thought aspire not to one heaven 
nor all our ship do sail for oneself haven 
I mean that all our suit and service 
we tend and tender to one only dame 
all choose one refuse the other two 

a great mislike among we that may breed 

I seek but one and she unto myself 

and one with I sans partner of my love 

it stand with honour to be sole or none 

who love thou pleasure 

hark you whisper in his ear 

Lush you lie 

if my master be a soldier that word will have the stab 

well Will still you will be a saucy scab 

why pleasure pomp have choose lucre love 

why pomp but pleasure honour lucre most 

and policy may lady lucre gain 
before you both but let we not contend 
for Nemo do the lady prisoner keep 
though they be slander late with Liberty 
and marriage to three far bear foreigner 
then first it fit we practise their release 
and see they and by sight our like place 
for yet we love as gossip tell their tale 
by hearsay fame not favour have we yet inflame 

lord policy with reason have discuss pleasure consent and so our love shall hold 

you never find that London pleasure err 
from reason or from pomp and policy 

Come on sir boy attend you well your charge to his page wit 
wait in this place to watch and ward this shield 
if any man in honour of his love 
so hardy be with stroke of sword to attaint 
this shield and challenge he that hereby challenge 
say for thy lord as shall a trusty page 
that policy do dare he to perform 
a hardy task than common challenger 
if he demand what policy may be 
a lord of London say one of the three 

and you sir boy for pomp perform the like to wealth 
bid he that dare this impreze batter once 
be well advise he be no beggar brat 
nor base of courage nor of bad conceit 
to match himself with such magnificence 
as fit lord pomp of London for his love 
call if he come that can encounter i 
or move i not for each envious swad 

will be not wanton nor of wayward mood to Will 
wait as do these use faith and diligence 
and mark he well that dare disdain this shield 
which London lord that pleasure have to name 
have here advance in honour of his dame 
I bid thou mark he well whatever he be 
that London pleasure do in malice scorn 
for he be a rascal or a stranger bear 
good boy mark well his gesture and his look 
his eye his gate his weapon and attire 
and dog he to his lodging or his den 
for I will make he scum and scorn of man 
no better boy than Will when Will be please 
be please my boy and so be my good Will 

and so good boy farewell look to your charge 
watch well good wit who scorn London policy 
be wary wit for thou can well discern 

wealth watch for pomp for thou can well defend 

Will can do something too when please he 

Will be a good boy where better be none exeunt the 5 lord 

nay wit be the best boy if will be go 

nay wealth be the best boy sir let that alone 

I wiss he say true will this wealth be a gay lad 

I care not for he curmudgeonly swad 

well miss i a while and you will go near to be sad 

Will you be will fool if of he you be not glad 

nay wit if thou want he thou will go near to be mad 

to keep we still quiet I will other talk we have 

I hope we will not fall out be none but we three 

if wealth be away wit and will will agree 

nay wit and will be at strife when there be nobody but we 

let pass and of our shield sir let we make a little glee 

what give thy master here a buzzard or a rite 

wit you show yourself a gentleman by guess so right 
a buzzard thou buzzard wit have no more skill 
than take a falcon for a buzzard 

o be quiet good will 
it be but for sport for I know the bird else 

thou may see it be no buzzard man by the bell 

what be the reason of this falcon I pray thou will show 

thou know that a falcon ware high and stoop low 
so do pleasure 

and what be the word 

pour temps for time 

a very pretty one I will it be in rhyme 

in rhyme wit why so 

because it want reason 

look for my fist wit if you rap out such treason 

treason to what boy 

to my master bird 

now will my thumb wag it be but to his word 

it be a pleasant gentleman this young mast wit 
your master have something too I pray you what be it 

look will and guess 

it be a load in a shell 

I have as lief you have say a frog in a well 

be it not a great butterfly Will can thou tell 

what be it in sadness 

a tortoise my boy who shell be so hard that a load cart may go over and not break it and so she be safe within and wheresoever she go she bear it on her back need neither other succour or shelter but her shell the word underneath she be providens securus the provident be safe like to the tortoise arm with his own defence and defend with his own armour in shape somewhat round signify compass wherein always the provident foresee to keep themselves within their own compass my boy 

witty speak now wealth may have get a daffadowndilly 

if Will have not be wilful now he may have say a lily who glory be without comparison and beauty matchless for Salomon the most sumptuous king that ever be be never comparable in glory with the lily neither be there any city matchable with the pomp of London mistake i not good boy that this pomp tend to pride yet London have enough but my lord pomp do right represent the stately magnificence and sumptuous estate without pride or vain glory to London accommodate and therefore the word be well apply to the impreze glory sans peer for that the lily be neither proud of the beauty nor vainglorious of the pomp no more be London but if it be joyful of any thing it be of the peace and plenty both flow from two such fountain as become not we to name now therefore my good boy know that my master be rather magnificence than pomp in bad sense and rather pomp than pride in the best sense 

and my lord be not pleasure spring of voluptuousness but of such honourable and honest kind conceit as heaven and humanity well brook and allow pleasure please not pernicious 

who will have think that will have be philosophous but what mean the word pour temps in the shield for time 

wit shall I call thou fool the best pleasure of all last but a time 
for of all pleasure most please to sight 
methinks there be none to the falcon high slight 
yet disease end it the breach of a wing 
nay the breach of a feather spoil that sweet thing 

and so my master have the vantage will you or not pomp and pleasure may be ill 

may not policy be bad 

wit well overtake by Will that crafty lad 

a crafty goose the gander give he health 
bad policy be seldom find in so Christian a common wealth 
as London be I trust where my master be a lord 

and we so too 

well let we accord for wit be a good thing yet may be ill apply 

and so may wealth be it employ in pride 
and will worst of all when it disdain a guide 

a jackanapes have wit 

and so he have will 

but he never have wealth now you be both still 

yes he wear a chain 

Well speak and like a bearward 

if you be non plus let the matter fall

will link yourselves with lady so forlorn 
and so distain with more than common crime 

marriage do make amends for many amiss

whereby their clothes of cost and curious stuff 
be wear to rag and give they much disgrace 

alas good lady be there none that sue

yes diverse for fair lucre seek release 
and some for love will fain have pay the fee 
but silly conscience sit without regard

and most for lucre none for conscience 
a vow I make which now I shall perform 
till some shall sue to have release for all 
judge as they be they shall remain in thrall 
but you that crave their freedom all at once 
shall have your suit and see they here ere long 
a little while you must have patience 
and leave this place go in my lord before 

become we to wait on Nemo still 

not so but lording the condition more 
you promise i sith they be in my power 
I shall dispose they when they be release 
upon you three as I shall think it best 

do but command and we shall all subscribe

love lucre conscience who thou have in thrall 
upon these stone to sit and take the air

no fraud though many have counterfeit both thou and i 
we be ourselves yet and no changeling I see 
and why shall thou ask i man if I live 
the silly ass can not feed on hard forage than usury 
she upon thistle and I upon a brown crust of a month old 

so that usury and a ass be two of the profitable beast that a man can keep yet the one have sharp tooth than the other 

but what mean dissimulation he droop methinks what cheer man why cousin frolic a fit be thou not glad of this meeting what be the cause of thy melancholy 

not melancholic but muse how it come to pass that we be thus fortunate to meet as we do 

I will tell thou why we meet because we be no mountain 

but you be as ill for you be monster 

and man may meet though mountain can 

in token that this meeting be joyful to we all 
let we embrace altogether with heart joy and affection

from whence good lord grow this hot argument 

thou know already yet if thou will hear 
for this we strive fond pleasure make account 
sum his bill without a auditory 
that lady lucre ought of right be he 

so I affirm and so I will maintain 
that lady lucre ought of right be he 

so I affirm and so I will maintain 
that pleasure ought by right dame lucre have 
to bear the charge of sport and of delight 

nay to support the haughty magnificence 
and lordly pomp of London excellence 
befit it rather lucre join with i 
by who her honour shall be most advance 

more fit for pomp than pleasure but most fit 
that policy with lucre shall be match 
as guerdon of my study and my care 
and high employment in the common wealth 

what pleasure can be foster without cost 

what pomp or port without respect of gain 

what policy without preferment life 

pleasure must have lucre 

pomp have need of lucre 

policy merit lucre 

pleasure die without lucre 

pomp decay without lucre 

policy droop without lucre 

thus lord you show your imperfection 
subject to passion strain honour bound 
be well advise you promise to be rule 
and have those dame by i dispose to you

make man forgetful of their great good 
be here a while dame lucre shall be bring 
by i to choose which lord she like best 
so you allow her choice with patience Exit

if she regard her good she will be i 

if she love happy life she will be i 
woman love pleasure 

woman love pomp 

woman use policy and here she come that must decide the doubt 

conscience content thou with a quaint conceit 
conceal thy name to work a special good 
thou be not know to any of these lord 
by face or feature till they hear thy name 
which must be lucre for a fine device 
and conscience clear indeed be the great gain 
lo lording here fair lucre who you love 
lucre the choice be leave unto thyself 
which of these three thou will for husband choose 

the modesty that do our sex beseem 
forbid my tongue therein to tell my thought 
but may it please my lord to pardon i 
which of you three shall deign to make such choice 
he shall I answer to his own content 

if lucre please to match with policy 
she shall be mistress over many man 

if lucre like to match with London pomp 
in stately port all other she shall pass 

if pleasure may for wife fair lucre gain 
her life shall be a earthly paradise 

Lo lucre man and port and pleasant life 
be here propound which will thou accept 

lord policy love be the only choice 
methinks for you that all your care employ 
and study for the love of common wealth

my lord I will I may advise you now 
to carry as it be a careless regard 
of these castilian and their accustom bravado

who all the world admire save only we

in this device such like I conceive 
as London shall not lack what pomp can do

do carry mind so frank and bountiful 
as for their honour they will spare no cost 
especial to let their enemy know 
honour in England not in Spain do grow

it be limit to such a honest end 
namely for recreation of the mind 
with no great cost yet liberal in that kind 
that pleasure vow with all delight he can 
to do they good till death to be their man 

of policy they trial have at large

my lord of Lincoln have you such title and such interest 
to love lucre and conscience as you say 
who give you leave to have access to they 
I be their father by adoption 
I never know of love betwixt they and you 
and to perpetual prison they be doom 
from whence I only may deliver they 
which at the suit of three most matchless lord 
their countryman in London breed as they 
I have perform and free they from their bond 
and yet have bind they in their freedom too 
to policy to pleasure and to pomp 
three lord of London who they be in right 
contract wife and do by my consent 
and even tomorrow be the marriage day 
except your come stay or break it off 
I will go call their lord to answer you 
the punder covert baron meddle not Exit 

fetch they lord Nemo we will here attend 

attend we may but unto little end 
the lady be in huckster handle now 

I will I have my time in pray spend 
that I in woo conscience do consume 

here come the lord let we show good countenance man 

yet more ado before we can enjoy 
the joy of marriage with our mistress 
be these the lord that title do pretend 
my lord of Lincoln so we hear you be 
what be your name 

devotion desire and delight 

which come for lucre 

I desire 

which for conscience 

I devotion 

which for love 

I delight 

you shall be answer straight 

I can answer they quick you can have they nor you shall not have they 

stay pleasure soft my lord desire you lucre seek desire of lucre be it without reproach to you my lord be covetousness which can be separate long from that read my lord 

in golden letter on this stone be write care 

care with desire of lucre well agree the rather for that London lucre may not be separate from London pomp so you may take that stone if you will but the lady you can have 

and a stone be a cold comfort instead of lucre 

devotion to conscience I speak now to you my lord that be learn be sorrow for sin or in one word read 

on this sweat stone in brass be set remorse 

and that be your portion for conscience be bestow on London pleasure because London make a conscience what pleasure they use and admit and what time they bestow therein and to what end so my lord devotion either that or nothing 

a stone be a hard lot in stod of a lady 

my lord delight that to delight in love you must I love for make choice of i love be my portion and that flint be you 

here in lead be write charity and what of this 

if you be as I doubt not honest delight in love then in the best sense you can have but charity if you be which I suspect not other delight in love you must be note for concupiscence and that you will blush to be well charity be your best then that be your portion for mark you London policy join with London love to show that all our policy be for love of London common wealth and so our love can be separate from our policy you bear this 

a flint be a hard change for so fair a wife 

and thus lord desire of lucre may take care devotion of conscience may have remorse and delight of love may have charity other recompense none 

and so we three leave you three with care remorse and charity 

with care and remorse I swear you do leave we but what charity I can tell 

well yet must we use charity though we fail of our desire and we be answer with such reason as be not to be gainsay 

Indeed my lord your calling be to persuade to charity but if I use patience it shall be perforce 

yet be so wise warn methinks we shall be arm and take this in worth that the world wonder no further I will take up my hard burden of remorse and be go 

it be good to follow example of good I will take this heavy burden of care and follow as I may 

because I will not be slagular I will frame myself to follow take this cold portion of charity as my share exit
