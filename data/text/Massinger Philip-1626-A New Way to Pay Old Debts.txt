only to consume meat and drink and batten 
upon reversion who advance who

and though I have meet with 
but ragged entertainment from your groom here 
I hope from you to receive that noble usage 
as may become the true friend of your husband 
and then I shall forget these 

I be amaze 
to see and hear this rudeness dare thou think 
though swear that it can ever find belief 
that I who to the best man of this country 
deny my presence since my husband death 
can fall so low as to change word with thou 
thou son of infamy forbear my house 
and know and keep the distance that be between we 
or though it be against my gentle temper 
I shall take order you no more shall be 
a eyesore to i 

scorn i not good lady 
but as in form you be angelical 
imitate the heavenly nature and vouchsafe 
at the least awhile to hear I you will grant 
the blood that run in this arm be as noble 
as that which fill your vein those costly jewel 
and those rich clothes you wear your man observance 
and woman flattery be in you no virtue 
nor these rag with my poverty in i vice 
you have a fair fame and I know deserve it 
yet lady I must say in nothing more 
than in the pious sorrow you have show 
for your late noble husband 

how she start 

and hardly can keep finger from the eye 
to hear he name 

have you aught else to say 

that husband madam be once in his fortune 
almost as low as I want debt and quarrel 
lay heavy on he let it not be think 
a boast in i though I say I relieve he 
it be I that give he fashion i the sword 
that do on all occasion second his 
I bring he on and off with honour lady 
and when in all man judgement he be sink 
and in his own hope not to be bung up 
I step unto he take he by the hand 
and set he upright 

be not we base rogue 
that can forget this 

I confess you make he 
master of your estate nor can your friend 
though he bring no wealth with he blame you for it 
for he have a shape and to that shape a mind 
make up of all part either great or noble 
so win a behaviour not to be 
resist madam 

it be most true he have 

for his sake then in that I be his friend 
do not contemn i 

for what be past excuse i 
I will redeem it order give the gentleman 
a hundred pound 

no madam on no term 
I will nor beg nor borrow six penny of you 
but be supply elsewhere or want thus ever 
only one suit I make which you deny not 
to stranger and it be this 

fie nothing else 

nothing unless you please to charge your servant 
to throw away a little respect upon i 

what you demand be you 

I thank you lady 
now what can be wrought out of such a suit 
be yet in supposition I have say all 
when you please you may retire nay all be forget 
and for a lucky omen to my project 
shake hand and end all quarrel in the cellar 

agree agree 

still merry master Welborne 

he be go I warrant thou this 
commission crush he 

your worship have the way out and never miss 
to squeeze these unthrift into air and yet 
the chapfallen justice do his part return 
for your advantage the certificate 
against his conscience and his knowledge too 
with your good favour to the utter ruin 
of the poor farmer 

it be for these good end 
I make he a justice he that bribe his belly 
be certain to command his soul 

I wonder 
still with your licence why your worship have 
the power to put this thingut in commission 
you be not in it yourself 

thou be a fool 
in be out of office I be out of danger 
where if I be a justice beside the trouble 
I may or out of wilfulness or error 
run myself fine into a praemunire 
and so become a prey to the informer 
no I will have none of it it be enough I keep 
greedy at my devotion so he serve 
my purpose let he hang or damn I care not 
friendship be but a word 

you be all wisdom 

I will be worldly wise for the other wisdom 
that do prescribe we a wellgoverned life 
and to do right to other as ourselves 
I value not a atom 

what course take you 
with your good patience to hedge in the manor 
of your neighbour master frugal as it be say 
he will nor sell nor borrow nor exchange 
and his land lie in the midst of your many lordship 
be a foul blemish 

I have think on it Marrall 
and it shall take I must have all man seller 
and I the only purchaser 

it be most fit sir 

I will therefore buy some cottage near he manor 
which do I will make my man break open his fence 
ride over his stand corn and in the night 
set fire on his barn or break his cattle leg 
these trespass draw on suit and suit expense 
which I can spare but will soon beggar he 
when I have harry he thus two or three year 
though he sue in forma pauperis in spite 
of all his thrift and care he will grow behindhand 

the best I ever hear I can adore you 

then with the favour of my man of law 
I will pretend some title want will force he 
to put it to arbitrement then if he sell 
for half the value he shall have ready money 
and I possess his land 

it be above wonder 
Welborne be apt to sell and need not 
these fine art sir to hook he in 

Well think on 
this varlet Marrall live too long to upbraid i 
with my close cheat put upon he will nor cold 
nor hunger kill he 

I know not what to think on it 
I have use all mean and the last night I cause 
his host the tapster to turn he out of door 
and have be since with all your friend and tenant 
and on the forfeit of your favour charge he 
though a crust of mouldy bread will keep he from starve 
yet they shall not relieve he this be do sir 

that be something Marrall but thou must go further 
and sudden Marrall 

where and when you please sir 

I will have thou seek he out and if thou can 
persuade he that it be better steal than beg 
then if I prove he have but robe a henroost 
not all the world shall save he from the gallows 
do any thing to work he to despair 
and it be thy masterpiece 

I will do my best sir 

I be now on my main work with the lord Lovel

such your gratitude call they 
nor be I of that harsh and rugged temper 
as some great man be tax with who imagine 
they part from the respect due to their honour 
if they use not all such as follow they 
without distinction of their birth like slave 
I be not so condition I can make 
a fit difference between my footboy

few lord can boast of when they be tempt oh 

why do you sigh can you be doubtful of i 
by that fair name I in the war have purchase 
and all my action hitherto untainted 
I will not be more true to my own honour 
than to my Alworth 

as you be the brave lord Lovel 
your bare word only give be a assurance 
of more validity and weight to i 
than all the oath bind up with imprecation 
which when they will deceive most courtier practice 
yet be a man for sure to style you more 
will relish of gross flattery I be force 
against my confidence of your worth and virtue 
to doubt nay more to fear 

so young and jealous 

be you to encounter with a single foe 
the victory be certain but to stand 
the charge of two such potent enemy 
at once assault you as wealth and beauty 
and those too second with power be odds 
too great for Hercules 

speak your doubt and fear 
since you will nourish they in plain language 
that I may understand they 

what be your will 
though I lend arm against my self provide 
they may advantage you must be obey 
my much love lord be Margaret only fair 
the cannon of her more than earthly form 
though mount high command all beneath it 
and ram with bullet of her sparkle eye 
of all the bulwark that defend your sense 
can batter more but that which guard your sight 
but when the well tune accent of her tongue 
make music to you and with numerous sound 
assault your hear such as if Ulysses 
now live again however he stand the Siren 
can not resist the combat must grow doubtful 
between your reason and rebellious passion 
add this too when you feel she touch and breath 
like a soft western wind when it glide over 
Arabia create gum and spice 
and in the van the nectar of her lip 
which you must taste bring the battalion on 
well arm and strong live with her discourse 
and know manner to give entertainment 
Hippolytus himself will leave Diana 
to follow such a Venus 

love have make you 
poetical Alworth

which if it be in man to do you will do it 
Mammon in sir Giles Overreach step in 
with heap of ill get gold and so much land 
to make she more remarkable as will tire 
a falcon wing in one day to fly over

that in herself be all perfection must 
prevail for she I here release your trust

upon your credit hold you it to be 
from your manor house to this of my lady Alworth 

why some four mile

for if you do abate but one half quarter 
of five you do yourself the great wrong 
that can be in the world for four mile ride

as I feel gnaw on i 

whither you ride 
or go a foot you be that way still provide

I have write this morning 
a few line to my mistress your fair daughter 

it will fire she for she be whole you already 
sweet master Alworth take my ring it will carry you 
to her presence I dare warrant you and there plead 
for my good lord if you shall find occasion 
that do pray ride to Nottingham get a licence 
still by this token I will have it dispatch 
and sudden my lord that I may say 
my honourable nay right honourable daughter

it be unwholesome to ride fast I will eat with you 
and eat to purpose 

some fury in that gut 
hungry again do you not devour this morning 
a shield of brawn and a barrel of Colchester oyster 

why that be sir only to scour my stomach 
a kind of a preparative Come gentleman 
I will not have you feed like the hangman of Vlushing 
alone while I be here 

have your return 

I will not fail my lord 

nor I to line 
my Christmas coffer 

to my wish we be private 
I come not to make offer with my daughter 
a certain portion that be poor and trivial 
in one word I pronounce all that be i 
in land or lease ready coin or good 
with she my lord come to you nor shall you have 
one motive to induce you to believe 
I live too long since every year I will add 
something unto the heap which shall be you too 

you be a right kind father 

you shall have reason 
to think i such how do you like this seat 
it be well wooded and well water the acre 
fertile and rich will it not serve for change 
to entertain your friend in a summer progress 
what think my noble lord 

it be a wholesome air 
and well build pile and she that be mistress of it 
worthy the large revenue 

'Shee the mistress 
it may be so for a time but let my lord 
say only that he like it and will have it 
I say ere long it be he 

impossible 

you do conclude too fast not know i 
nor the engine that I work by it be not alone 
the lady Alworth land for those once Welborne 
as by her dotage on he I know they will be 
shall soon be i but point out any man 
in all the shire and say they lie convenient 
and useful for your lordship and once more 
I say aloud they be you 

I dare not own 
what be by unjust and cruel mean extort 
my fame and credit be more dear to i 
than so to expose they to be censure by 
the public voice 

you run my lord no hazard 
your reputation shall stand as fair 
in all good man opinion as now 
nor can my action though condemn for ill 
cast any foul aspersion upon you 
for though I do contemn report myself 
as a mere sound I still will be so tender 
of what concern you in all point of honour 
that the immaculate whiteness of your fame 
nor your unquestioned integrity 
shall ever be sully with one taint or spot 
that may take from your innocence and candour 
all my ambition be to have my daughter 
right honourable which my lord can make she 
and may I live to dance upon my knee 
a young lord Lovel bear by she unto you 
I write nil ultra to my proud hope 
as for possession and annual rent 
equivalent to maintain you in the port 
your noble birth and present state require 
I do remove that burden from your shoulder 
and take it on my own for though I tithe 
the country to supply your riotous waste 
the scourge of prodigal want shall never find you 

be you not fright with the imprecation 
and curse of whole family make wretched 
by your sinister practise 

yes as rock be 
when foamy billow split themselves against 
their flinty rib or as the moon be move 
when wolf with hunger pine howl at her brightness 
I be of a solid temper and like these 
steer on a constant course with my own sword 
if call into the field I can make that right 
which fearful enemy murmur at as wrong 
now for these other piddle complaint 
breathe out in bitterness as when they call i 
extortioner tyrant cormorant or intruder 
on my poor neighbour right or grand encloser 
of what be common to my private use 
nay when my care be pierce with widow cry 
and undo orphan wash with tear my threshold 
I only think what it be to have my daughter 
right honourable and it be a powerful charm 
make i insensible of remorse or pity 
or the least sting of conscience 

I admire 
the toughness of your nature 

it be for you 
my lord and for my daughter I be marble 
nay more more if you will have my character 
in little I enjoy more true delight 
in my arrival to my wealth these dark 
and crooked way than you shall ever take pleasure 
in spend what my industry have compass 
my haste command i hence in one word therefore 
be it a match 

I hope that be past doubt now 

then rest secure not the hate of all mankind here 
nor fear of what can fall on i hereafter 
shall make i study aught but your advancement 
one story high a earl if gold can do it 
dispute not my religion nor my faith 
though I be bear thus headlong by my will 
you may make choice of what belief you please 
to i they be equal so my lord good morrow 

he be go I wonder how the earth can bear 
such a portent ay that have live a soldier 
and stand the enemy violent charge undaunted 
to hear this blasphemous beast I be bathe all over 
in a cold sweat yet like a mountain he 
confirm in atheistical assertion 
be no more shake than Olympus be 
when angry Boreas load his double head 
with sudden drift of snow 

save you my lord 
disturb I not your privacy 

no good madam 
for your own sake I be glad you come no soon 
since this bold bad man sir Giles Overreach 
make such a plain discovery of himself 
and read this morning such a devilish matin 
that I shall think it a sin next to he 
but to repeat it 

I never press my lord 
on other privacy yet against my will 
walk for health sake in the gallery 
adjoin to your lodging I be make 
so vehement and loud he be partaker 
of his tempt offer 

please you to command 
your servant hence and I shall glad hear 
your wise counsel 

it be my lord a woman 
but true and hearty wait in the next room 
but be within call yet not so near to force i 
to whisper my intent 

we be teach better 
by you good madam 

and well know our distance 

do so and talk not it will become your breed exeunt Amble and woman 
now my good lord if I may use my freedom 
as to a honour friend 

you lessen else 
your favour to i 

I dare then say thus 
as you be noble however common man 
make sordid wealth the object and sole end 
of their industrious aim it will not agree 
with those of eminent blood who be engage 
more to prefer their honour than to increase 
the state leave to they by their ancestor 
to study large addition to their fortune 
and quite neglect their birth though I must grant 
riches well get to be a useful servant 
but a bad master 

madam it be confess 
but what infer you from it 

This my lord 
that as all wrong though thrust into one scale 
slide of themselves off when right fill the other 
and can bide the trial so all wealth 
I mean if ill acquire cement to honour 
by virtuous way achieve and brave purchase 
be but as rubbage pour into a river 
however intend to make good the bank 
render the water that be pure before 
pollute and unwholesome I allow 
the heir of sir Giles Overreach Margaret 
a maid well qualify and the rich match 
our north part can make boast of yet she can 
with all that she bring with her fill their mouth 
that never will forget who be her father 
or that my husband Alworth land and Welborne 
how wring from both needs now no repetition 
be real motive that more work your lordship 
to join your family than her form and virtue 
you may conceive the rest 

I do sweet madam 
and long since have consider it I know 
the sum of all that make a just man happy 
consist in the well choose of his wife 
and there well to discharge it do require 
equality of year of birth of fortune 
for beauty be poor and not cry up 
by birth or wealth can true mix with neither 
and wealth where there be such difference in year 
and fair descent must make the yoke uneasy 
but I come near 

pray you do my lord 

Were Overreach stat's thrice centuple his daughter 
million of degree much fair than she be 
however might urge precedent to excuse i 
I will not so adulterate my blood 
by marry Margaret and so leave my issue 
make up of several piece one part scarlet 
and the other londonblue in my own tomb 
I will inter my name first 

I be glad to hear this aside 
why then my lord pretend you marriage to she 
dissimulation but tie false knot 
on that straight line by which you hitherto 
have measure all your action 

I make answer 
and apt with a question wherefore have you 
that since your husband death have live a strict 
and chaste nun life on the sudden give yourself 
to visit and entertainment think you madam 
it be not growge public conference or the favour 
which you too prodigal have throw on Welborne 
be too reserve before incur not censure 

I be innocent here and on my life I swear 
my end be good 

on my soul so be i 
to Margaret but leave both to the event 
and since this friendly privacy do serve 
but as a offer mean unto ourselves 
to search each other far you have show 
your care of i ay my respect to you 
deny i not but still in chaste word madam 
a afternoon discourse 

so I shall hear you 

undo undo this be your counsel froth 

i I defy thou do not master Marrall 
he have mar all I be sure strict command we 
on pain of sir Giles Overreach displeasure 
to turn the gentleman out of door

but now he be his uncle darling and have get 
master justice greedy since he fill his belly 
at his commandment to do any thing

and they swarm about he like so many soldier 
on the pay day and have find out such a new way 
to pay his old debt as it be very likely

or any esculent as the learned call it 
for their emolument but sheer drink only 
for which gross fault I here do damn thy licence

this only in a word I know sir Giles 
will come upon you for security 
for his thousand pound which you must not consent to 
as he grow in heat as I be sure he will 
be you but rough and say he be in your debt 
ten time the sum upon sale of your land 
I have a hand in it I speak it to my shame 
when you be defeat of it 

that be forgive 

I shall deserve it then urge he to produce 
the deed in which you pass it over to he 
which I know he will have about he to deliver 
to the lord Lovel with many other write 
and present money I will instruct you further 
as I wait on your worship if I play not my price 
to your full content and your uncle much vexation 
hang up Jack Marrall 

I rely upon thou 

whither to yield the first praise to my lord 
unequalled temperance or your constant sweetness 
that I yet live my weak hand fasten on 
hope anchor spite of all storm of despair 
I yet rest doubtful 

give it to lord Lovel 
for what in he be bounty in i be duty 
I make but payment of a debt to which 
my vow in that high office register 
be faithful witness 

it be true my dear 
yet when I call to mind how many fair one 
make wilful shipwreck of their faith and oath 
to God and man to fill the arm of greatness 
and you rise up less than a glorious star 
to the amazement of the world that hold out 
against the stern authority of a father 
and spurn at honour when it come to court you 
I be so tender of your good that faint 
with your wrong I can wish myself that right 
you yet be please to do i 

yet and ever 
to i what be title when content be want 
or wealth rake up together with much care 
and to be keep with more when the heart pine 
in be dispossess of what it long for 
beyond the indian mine or the smooth brow 
of a please site that slave i to his will 
and so his ravenous humour may be feast 
by my obedience and he see i great 
leave to my soul nor faculty nor power 
to make her own election 

but the danger 
that follow the repulse 

to i they be nothing 
let Alworth love I can be unhappy 
suppose the worst that in his rage he kill i 
a tear or two by you drop on my hearse 
in sorrow for my fate will call back life 
so far as but to say that I die you 
I then shall rest in peace or shall he prove 
so cruel as one death will not suffice 
his thirst of vengeance but with linger torment 
in mind and body I must waste to air 
in poverty join with banishment so you share 
in my affliction which I dare not wish you 
so high I prize you I can undergo they 
with such a patience as shall look down 
with scorn on his worst malice 

heaven avert 
such trial of your true affection to i 
nor will it unto you that be all mercy 
show so much rigour but since we must run 
such desperate hazard let we do our best 
to steer between they 

your lord be we and sure 
and though but a young actor second i 
in do to the life what he have plot 
the end may yet prove happy now my Alworth 

to your letter and put on a seem anger 

I will pay my lord all debt due to his title 
and when with term not take from his honour 
he do solicit i I shall glad hear he 
but in this peremptory nay command way 
to appoint to appoint a meeting and without my knowledge 
a priest to tie the knot can never be undo 
till death unloose it be a confidence 
in his lordship will deceive he 

I hope better 
good lady 

hope sir what you please for i 
I must take a safe and secure course I have 
a father and without his full consent 
though all lord of the land kneel for my favour

my fury can reach the coward hunter 
and only spend itself I will quit the place 
alone I can do nothing but I have servant 
and friend to second i and if I make not 
this house a heap of ash by my wrong 
what I have speak I will make good or lean 
one throat uncut if it be possible

brave sport I be sure it have take away my stomach 
I do not like the sauce 

nay weep not dear 
though it express your pity what be decree 
above we can alter 

his threat move i 
no scruple madam 

be it not a rare trick 
and it please your worship to make the deed nothing 
I can do twenty neat if you please 
to purchase and grow rich for I will be 
such a solicitor and steward for you 
as never worshipful have 

I do believe thou 
but first discover the quaint mean you use 
to raze out the conveyance 

they be mystery 
not to be speak in public certain mineral 
incorporate in the ink and wax 
beside he give i nothing but still feed i 
with hope and blow and that be the inducement 
to this conundrum if it please your worship 
to call to memory this mad beast once cause i 
to urge you or to drown or hang yourself 
I will do the like to he if you command i 

you be a rascal he that dare be false 
to a master though unjust will never be true 
to any other look not for reward 
or favour from i I will shun thy sight 
as I will do a basilisk thank my pity 
if thou keep thy care however I will take order 
your practice shall be silence 

I will commit he 
if you will have i sir 

that be to little purpose 
his conscience be his prison not a word 
but instant begone 

take this kick with you 

and this 

if that I have my cleaver here 
I will divide your knave head 

this be the haven 
false servant still arrive at 

Come again 

fear not I be your guard 

his look be ghastly 

some little time I have spend under your favour 
in physical study and if my judgement err not 
he be mad beyond recovery but observe he 
and look to yourselves 

why be not the whole world 
include in myself to what use then 
be friend and servant say there be a squadron 
of pike line through with shot when I be mount 
upon my injury shall I fear to charge they 
no I will through the battalion and that rout 
I will fall to execution ha I be feeble flourish his sword unsheathe 
some undo widow sit upon my arm 
and take away the use of it and my sword 
glue to my scabbard with wrong orphan tear 
will not be draw ha what be these sure hangman 
that come to bind my hand and then to drag i 
before the judgement seat now they be new shape 
and do appear like fury with steel whip 
to scourge my ulcerous soul shall I then fall 
inglorious and yield no spite of fate 
I will be force to hell like to myself 
though you be legion of accurse spirit 

thus will I fly among you 
there be no help 
disarm he first then bind he 

take a mittimus 
and carry he to bedlam 

how he foam 

And bite the earth 

Carry he to some dark room 
there try what art can do for his recovery 

o my dear father 

you must be patient mistress 

here be a precedent to teach wicked man 
that when they leave religion and turn atheist 
their own ability leave they pray you take comfort 
I will endeavour you shall be his guardian 
in his distraction and for your land master Welborne 
be it good or ill in law I will be a umpire 
between you and this the undoubt heir 
of sir Giles Overreach for i here be the anchor 
that I must fix on 

what you shall determine 
my lord I will allow of 

it be the language 
that I speak too but there be something else 
beside the repossession of my land 
and payment of my debt that I must practise 
I have a reputation but it be lose 
in my loose course and till I redeem it 
some noble way I be but half make up 
it be a time of action if your lordship 
will please to confer a company upon i 
in your command I doubt not in my service 
to my king and country but I shall do something 
that may make i right again 

your suit be grant 
and you love for the motion 

nothing want then 
but your allowance
