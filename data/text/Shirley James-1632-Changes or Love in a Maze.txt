there be so much sweetness in she such a troop 
of grace wait on her word and action 
I love she infinite and think it blessing 
to see her smile but when the other come 
in presence in her eye she bring a charm 
to make i dote on she I be divide 
and like the tremble needle of a dial

I have inquire your fortune and lament 
with love pity such a noble creature 
shall be confine to narrow limit come 
to bring you freedom make you mistress of 
your liberty and myself if you can think 
i worthy of your love I do not court

with too much haste what great one may be proud 
to expect after much suit and that you can 
find in your tongue consent encourage i 
but for the present with one smile 

I can 
unless I counterfeit I have not smile 
these ten month if a sigh will pleasure you 
I can afford enough to break your heart 
and yet I live walk into the other room 
you will find a alteration in the air 
and think you come into a mist which I 
make all with my own sigh but I will not 
infect you so you seem a honest gentleman 

her sorrow help the growth of my affection 
what will she be in peace that be so lovely 
in her distress I wish you will impose 
something on i to settle your sad thought 
I will embrace a danger to assure 
the quiet of your mind 

it be in the power 
of one that will be kind to help i but 

make i that friend 

you may love i too much 
to undertake that task 

too much I can 

o yes for though I shall esteem he dear 
and call he my true friend that in this storm 
will lend a cord to save i yet such be 
the misery of the employment he must not 
love i too well that do it 

be more plain 
and let i never hope to be call you 
if I refuse any command that may 
or profit or delight you 

I release these hasty 
protestation 

I pray trust i 

I will although 
every syllable you speak make i suspect 
you will repent this freedom if you will do 
a grateful office to i in your person 
give this paper to a gentleman give he a letter 

your name 

in the direction 
you will find it with all necessary circumstance 
to meet with he 

this all you do not well 
to mock my honest heart with this cheap service 
I be in earnest when I promise more 
than carriage of a letter 

if you please 
to make it then a perfect act of nobleness 
you may take notice that I long have love he 
and if you find he cold in the perusal 
tell he I have the promise of his faith 
when I give up my heart in the presence of 
a thousand angel that will witness it 
if yet he be not soft to stir up his 
compassion tell he how I live and languish 
you may report you see i weep I have not 
much more to say if you will do this favour 
it will be a argument of your respect 
I see your resolution cool already 

it be a severe employment but I will do 
something pray honour i to kiss your hand 
I have not yet deserve to reach your lip 
content dwell in your bosom 

what success 

I hope well some affair 
call i away Exit 

good master Yongrave how do you like this gentleman 

I shall desire to see he again my heart 
be light upon sudden please you uncle 
I will in and play a lesson of my lute Exit 

do what you please I relish not your air 
that be only sweet to i that profit bring 
there be no music without golden string 

be ever maid so miserable in her affection 

be not my fate as cruel 
can we love he still and yet be sister 
I hope we may the love I bear to he 
shall not destroy my piety to you 
nature have frame we two in person but we be both one in heart 

Indeed we be we be too much one 
and both love one too much for either to enjoy he 

say not so give i a little time and I will try 
how I can give he you I will persuade 
my heart to let he go 

alas poor sister 
why shall you give he i it be no argument 
because I come one minute into life 
before you therefore you shall render first 
to i what be so precious to yourself 
rather let i begin that be first make 
acquaint to the world resign to thou 
and make thou happy by enjoy he 

but do you know the miserable consequence 
for if you love he with that truth and fervour 
you speak of as it be a sin in i 
not to believe it can you look for less 
than death to see i mistress of his faith 
and lead in nuptial triumph to the church 

I can tell 

or if it do not kill you 
so soon I know the sorrow will distract you 
how can I smile to see my sister weep 
away her eye and tell the jar minute 
with hasty sigh to know herself forsake 

and can it be you can do less that love he 
as well as I to see he make my husband 
will it not make you melancholy sister 
and oft retire into the dark to weep 
can you behold we free kiss embrace 
and go to bed together remember that 
you give this friend to i from your own 
heart and live 

why let i die then 
rather than you I shall perhaps obtain 
some charitable epitaph to tell 
the world I die to save my sister life 
it be no such thing to die 

this be again 
our misery it be not in our power 
be resignation to assure to either 
his love he only must determine it 
we can guide his passion 

nor himself 
direct it as he now appear divide 
may be it will be fortunate for both 
will he be more particular 

that make 
our flame increase that he protest he love 
we both so equal 

it be very strange 

let we then join our argument to persuade he 
to point out one of we to be his bride 
other in time may hope to gain her freedom 
I know not what I say we both must plead 
against ourselves see he be come already 

the scale be even still that one have less 
perfection to make the doubtful balance 
give difference in their value but I wrong 
their virtue to wish either any want 
that equal incline my soul to love they 
justice I now consent thou shall be blind 
my eye be but the cause I can see 
and will not give my judgement leave to make 
distinction of these two Democritus 
I do allow thy rashness and confess 
than thou do rectify thy contemplation 
when thou do lose thy sight which of these two 
instruct i love that other both what fate 
hover about my choice be it not sin 
I will be blind as poet fancy love 
into who now I be transform that then 
my soul not look through these glass may 
with inward speculation aim at she 
that be the happy if one can be so 

sir if we be not troublesome 

you can 

to interrupt your meditation we have a suit 

both it must needs be grant 

nor let we suffer in our modesty 
if our request seem strange 

it be a command 
and I must needs obey you two divide this empire 

you prepare we dispute not 
the strangeness of your love but pity it 
and be so ready in our own affection 
to answer your opinion of we both 
that if you can collect what divide 
on two and place it fair upon one 
choose who you will make happy 

we expect not 
your hasty answer though we both desire 
a swift end to your trouble 

I pray stay Exit 
I will determine now but can fair one 
be ever lover so perplex I must resolve 

why how now Frank what melancholy 

How come you hither 

why of my foot 
I be at your lodging to inquire for you

entertainment come let i counsel you

by drink their health too often 

prithee do not trifle 

what will have i answer I can love

where to direct my service 

that question 
have puzzle i already 

say which be it you best affect 

I love they both so equal 
I know not which to name 

how both what then 
shall I do with they be thou mad

master Caperwit before you read pray tell i 
have your verse any adjective 

adjective will you have a poem without 
adjective they be the flower the grace of all our language 
a well choose epithet do give new soul 
to faint poesy and make every verse 
a bride with adjective we bait our line 
when we do fish for gentlewoman love 
and with their sweetness catch the nibble ear 
of amorous lady with the music of 
these ravish noun we charm the silken tribe 
and make the gallant melt with apprehension 
of the rare word I will maintain it against 
a bundle of grammarian in poetry 
the substantive itself can subsist 
without a adjective 

but for all that 
those word will sound more full methinks that be not 
so lard and if I may counsel you 
you shall compose a sonnet clean without they 
a row of stately substantive will march 
like Swisser and bear all the field before they 
carry their weight show fair like deed enrol 
not writ that be first make and after fill 
Thence first come up the title of blank verse 
you know sir what blank signify when the sense 
first frame be tie with adjective like point 
and can not hold together without wedge 
hang it it be pedantic vulgar poetry 
let child when they versify stick here 
and there these piddle word for want of matter 
poet write masculine number

infusion of sack will heighten i

she be hard of soul but I must supple she 
and there be a conceit new strike upon my brain 
will do it 〈◊〉 〈◊〉 〈◊〉 force unite conquer 
lady grow soft if merit can prove 
happy we must use policy in love Exit 

no more you do not well to wrong your friend 
that trust you with his bosom 

fair one hear i

unworthy to supplant he

the creature have to wish their own felicity 
which can be without you he will not 
repine to see i happy in your love 

in seem to extenuate your error 
you thus enlarge it and bring into question 
the honour of your friend for who I must 
though weak rise up a champion for his virtue 
and to beat off all argument on your part 
to move for my affection know he be next heaven 
the only object of my heart nor can it know a change 

and yet if you collect yourself you be not 
the only mistress of his heart your sister he love 
as well as you your pardon fair it be possible

transfix i and can only cure the wound 
with the same eye if they but smile upon it 

I must not hear you plead thus you appear

thy face I will tell myself how thou have speed 
well be it not so yet do not answer i

in the corner of thy forehead that will spread

Eugenia Chr lead in Eug 

be all this wake have I see her faint 
and do not she that cherish her enemy 
haste to her relief and seem to suffer with she 
while I as one have grow here do not move 
I do not well to exalt she with a hope 
to meet a blessing and then ruin she 
if death have whisper she aside I shall 
be accuse and I will take my preferment 
to be send after she to tell her ghost 
I love her best when we be both immortal 
she will understand i better 
be Eugenia alive again 

there be no danger to be fear a qualm 
pray let i ask you sir one question 
do you affect this virgin real 
I move it not for any harm 

will she have send hither 
but with desire to be resolve 

may be she have 

then tell she I do love her better 
than I can express but when she have 
number all thing be excellent on earth 
she be to i above they infinite 

This carry no probability 

will thou be a man 
than I dare tell thou I do love she so 
I dare be wicked for she and kill thou 

with all this it do not appear you love she so 
and be a instrument nay plead to put another in possession 
of your love treasure for if I mistake not 
you late do urge a man who she esteem 
better to return and marry she 
can any man that love a woman true 
strive to supplant himself and give away 
his comfort 

there be the honour of my service 
when I be dead the story shall remember 
I love a maid so well that I prefer 
whatever she desire above myself 
and cause she love one better be content 
to serve her wish with my banishment 
he do not love a virgin noble who 
affection walk not just to her desire 
to like they above his own 

if this can be 
thou be the noble lover in the world 
with what affection shall she be bless 
that love he when the mistress that esteem 
he not be thus reward 

Indeed I love he still and shall do ever 
nor have I now return to life but that 
I have not take my leave of he 

more corrosive 

if you will oblige a virgin 
for ever to you once more visit he 
tell he I lie like one that be desperate sick 
oppress with grief of body and of mind 
but can be so fortunate to quit 
the world till he vouchsafe to visit i 
bid he not fear I will detain he long 
with idle talk six word and I be dead 
although he love i not he may do this 
if you will add this to your other work 
I will impose no more indeed I will not 
so farewell noble sir Exit 

if you will please to join with i I doubt not 
to effect her wish 

no 

you do not know what power I have with he 

you have too much 

I will undertake 

you shall rob i of the reward 

what reward 

perhaps another kiss pray tell she I 
go cheerful to finish her command Exit 

I do admire and love this noble temper 
what flame be these suppress they they grow high 
if he affect she so what hope have I Ex 

mad why you still enjoy discourse 

what then may not a man be mad and yet talk wise 

but few in my experience 

do not abuse thy knowledge at the worst 
thou can but say our sense be deprave 
throw off of the hinge the tongue be none I hope 
though some will have the titillation 
join to make up a six in the grave synod 
believe then I be mad I will prove it by reason 

by reason that be a new way to prove it 
but I will hear no reason 

then thou be mad thyself 

nay I think I be mad of the two 
and have as much reason if there be reason 
able to make one mad but let we be wise 
or if it must be that you have lose your wit 
let we see and we can recover they by drink 
for he that be not sober after drunkenness 
be no man of this world 

now thou talk wild 

I talk wild that will justify myself to be in my wit and you that talk reason and sense will believe you have any 

if it be so that may conclude I have lose they 
and do not understand myself 

So so I shall believe another in that argument 
but not you for in know that you prove 
you be no madman 

prithee tell i thou be a piece of a philosopher 
and know the natural cause 

hold in that I must confess you be little 
beside yourself I a philosopher 
I study titleman sometime in the college 
as other do and want Epictetus 
lantern sleep always with a watch candle 
in my study window and may very well 
dream over learning of my desk or so 
what Aristotle may infuse into 
my sleep I know not but wake I never trouble 
myself to understand he true I love 
his book de coelo for the heavenly title 
and make my father buy it for my study 
of divinity tell he I will be a bishop 
that bring i threescore pound a year for sack 
I prithee do not talk of learning 

why then acknowledge I be mad and I have do 

well for this once I will allow it thou be mad 

but wherefore do you allow it what be the cause 

nay nay I know not that 

I will tell thou then 

it be come about again 

and let thy judgement censure i 
if I produce not able reason 

to prove madness he make i mad to hear he 
now I consider better on it I confess 
you have some cause to be a little mad 
the loss of such a mistress 

but of one 
do they not both affect i and I they 
with such equality of honour 

grant it 

and I to lose they both faith speak but honest 
be it not a wonder that I do not rave 
and kill myself how many have run mad 
for one that never love they and shall I 
be so unmannerly not to lose my wit 
for two and two such creature it be a solecism 
in love I prithee do not flatter i 
with a opinion that I have my reason 
it can be it be against all sense 
I shall have any such a expectation 
lose be enough to make the genius 
of all the world run mad and I will straight 

whither 

to bedlam whether shall I go 
I must not live in this community of fool and wiseman 

there be knave among we 

here all be happy there I shall meet 
with lover that be fortunate but with man 
of my complexion that look twenty way 
at once that sigh and curse and sing mad carol 
if I can get to be their prince I will make 
a law it shall be death to smile or kiss 
a woman 

now I fear he 

nay we will have 
a excellent well govern common wealth 
a delicate Utopia there shall be 
lecture and public reading shall put down 
Gressam foundation for the liberal art 
and make the citizen bring their shopbook hither 
to take fine note how to be pay their debt 
and yet trust none but young brother than 
we will have penal statute against eat 
live all by the air of commendation 
no idle man shall live within our state 
do you mark they be the mouth of the republic 
and therefore he that have no other work 
to prevent slothfulness may employ his time 
in pick straw there will be a great plenty 
here will we live together and be mad 
perpetual we will be recover 
for if at any time we incline to be 
sober and come to our wit again 
the lash will whip we into new distemper 
and mad fugary 

do you know all this while 
what you have say you correct i for speak 
extravagant and yet talk wild yourself 

I prithee pardon and instruct i better I be not well 

will you walk to your chamber I will bear you company 

no I be well again 
upon condition you will tell Aurelia 
she do not use i kind 

I will

it may disturb his fancy but I hope 
the worst be past a little rest will settle he 
but which way shall I recompense the injury 
I have do he and I have not be ungrateful
