my lord though I affect you 
almost with that religion I do our god yet 
the constant motion of my will do fix 
on noble Argalus and I confess 
his gracious merit challenge a wife 
fair as Parthenia do she stain the east 
when the bright morn hang day upon her cheek 
in chain of liquid pearl 

I must confess 
I have not study the nice rule of love 
nor can with flatter eloquence adore 
a lady airy shadow court her smile 
with adoration or with supple knee 
cringe like a humorous dancer when the air 
play be with her hair or fret to see the sun 
be over saucy with her cheek or lip 
I speak this to my glory the big war 
have be my mistress where intent field 
when I have see a move grove of pike 
advance as if the splendour of their head 
mean to obscure the sun beam gore the cloud 
till they weep aloud and hear the fiery horse 
neigh destruction to an host of man 
from their hot nostril there I do command 
with ample fortune and to be repulse 
in a effeminate skirmish wound my soul 
worse than a quiver of sharp parthian shaft 
can prejudice my body 

I can wish 
both for your present peace and to secure 
your future quiet you have still confine 
your disposition to that warfare this 
be far more dangerous he that mean to win 
love bloodless battle must be strong in tear 
marshal his army in a field of sigh 
have for his ensign beauty in his look 
under which colour ought to march kind smile 
as able soldier in the van smooth vow 
and amorous oath will batter lady heart 
soon than sling or iron ram demolish 
resist citadel 

can thou conceit 
that I Demagoras to who very name 
laconian matron have with early haste 
pay tributary vow her choice maid 
have leave Pan orgy to present soft hymn 
to the honour of my merit can decline 
so much my great soul as with force entreat 
to beg Parthenia mercy let tame fool 
such as have heart scarce fit to furnish dove 
or spleen less lamb with courage intercede 
for female favour by submissive prayer 
my resolution ground on the worth 
of my desert shall with her mother power 
enforce Parthenia be she cold as air 
in its most subtle motion to become 
in her affection fervent as the day 
that she be bear in be to gawdy light 
or ruin her best comfort 

I be fain to be 
your most industrious advocate my daughter 
think she offend in each familiar look 
bestow on manhood but I hope that time 
and counsel may convert she to become 
love proselyte 

she be that already madam 
or Argalus dare not without consent 
and patronage from she rival my love 
but if the boy oppose i in a thought 
borrow a smile or pay a amorous glance 
as tribute to her eye be he defence 
with some light bog that dance to the wind 
loud whistle music I will dart a frown 
shall ravish his mortality into air 
for the presumption 

it be my lord 
this rough demeanour though it speak you man 
declare a spirit full of fire which do fright 
Parthenia softness virgin love be win 
like heaven compassion by submissive prayer 
it be not the brave relation of a fight 
can move the mild breast of a tender maid 
to aught but terror she will start at sight 
of scar though buy with honour bleed in tear 
when wound be mention for lord Argalus 
his affable and courtly carriage call 
respective blush into the bashful cheek 
of every virgin that my daughter bind 
by a due justice to esteem his worth 
with more than common courtesy yet my will 
second by a mother kind entreat 
shall work upon her duty to accept 
you will as she servant 

servant lady 
what mortal fool ambitious to outvie 
the god in honour dare presume to hope 
that glorious title from i have I stand 
when army timorous of a general death 
quake with panic horror have invoke 
divine assistance fearless and not deem 
heaven power deserve a religious prayer 
after so many trophy as may claim 
each its particular star to be esteem 
a servant to a woman 

nay my good lord 

persuade the girl 
to attire like Juno in a dress of cloud 
her beauteous head put off her human earth 
for immortality and achieve a seat 
due to the queen of heaven that with regard 
the humble senate of the petty god 
and goddess may tremble adore 
the sparkle majesty yet be my will 
not satisfy by voluntary gift 
of her affection my great soul will scorn it 
worse than the proffer service of a slave 

see my daughter 
my lord lose not this opportunity 
you shall have place and leisure for my presence 
shall be no detriment to your purpose 

now lady 
be you in haste or do you slight a presence 
may challenge your observance I be come 
confident of my merit to inform you 
you ought to yield i the most strict regard 
your love can offer 

sir I be not 
though I affect not selfconceited boast 
so ignorant of my worth but I deserve 
from he who will enjoy i a respect 
more fair and Courtlike 

the blunt phrase of war 
be my accustom language yet I can 
tell you you be handsome and direct your look 
with a become posture I must speak 
in the heroic dialect as I use 
to court Bellona when my high desire 
aim at a glorious victory 

you will scarce 
conquer a lady with this stern discourse 
Mars do not woo the queen of love in arm 
but wrap his batter limb in persian silk 
or costly tyrian purple speak in smile 
to win her tempt beauty 

I will bring on 
wellmanaged troop of soldier to the fight 
draw big battalia like a move field 
of stand corn blow one way by the wind 
against the fright enemy the van 
shall save the rear a labour and by i 
marshal shall fold bright conquest in the curl 
of their conduct ensign while grim death 
shall on the feather arrow with more haste 
then on his own shaft fly upon the foe 
while the shrill trumpet and each pierce fife 
shall sing their dirge and the hoarse mouth drum 
war fatal bell with surly noise proclaim 
their sudden funeral this brave resolve 
vanquish my steel wing goddess and engage 
peneian Daphne who do fly the sun 
give up to willing ravishment her bough 
to invest my awful front and this shall prostrate 
spite of all opposition your nice soul 
to my command merit 

these high term be apt to fright a enemy or beget 
terror in flinty bosom can you think 
a timorous virgin can affect her fear 
yield the security of her peace and life 
to the protection of her horror you must not persuade my thought that you who vary so the scene of love can act it perfect 

slight in this it be a contempt inhuman and deserve my utmost scorn 

nay may most honour lord be not transport with a needless rage it be but her childish folly 
you have do ill to entertain a man 
of such a absolute worth with such a mean 
regardless value you must alter this 
neglectful temper or my anger will 
surpass my natural love and I shall chide 
your too affect niceness 

gracious madam 
the zealous duty which religious law 
teach i owe my parent will inflict 
a heavy curse for disobedient guilt 
upon my innocence shall I transgress 
the intention of your honourable will 
in what I can obey it 

then in this 
you be resolve to usurp the privilege 
of your discretion and not fulfil 
my will in the disposal of your love 

yes with that freedom that I will to heaven 
tender my best obedience but since love 
be by example and discourse allow 
reason superior it must be esteem 
above all duty 

yet there ought to be 
consent attain from those who power shall guide 
their child youth and action 

it be confess 
but not except it just sympathize 
with their affection you will have suffer 
a conflict in your peace have you be force 
when your free will have yield up your heart 
my father choice to have have it ravish back 
and in despite of your resolve confer 
upon another 

I be not so childish 
to contradict my parent but subscribe 
to their discretion as I will advise 
you will obey i and yield consent 
to wed Demagoras 

what can your wisdom 
behold in he if with impartial eye 
you will survey his quality that shall engage 
your inclination to enforce my love 
beside the native fierceness of his look 
apt to fright a lady than beget 
fancy his courtship clothe in angry threat 
as if that love be turn a soldier 
and have unyoke her team of spleenless dove 
to have her chariot draw by ravenous wolf 
tiger or treacherous leopard have put off 
her wreath of harm esse myrtle to invest 
her brow with yew or cypress 

this excuse 
proceed not from his merit but your love 
to Argalus a stranger only know 
for his brisk courtship the queen support 
his waver fortune he depend on she 
and shall she fail by death his utmost hope 
embrace a sudden ruin 

Argalus 
be he more abject in his fate than your 
imagination can conceit deserve 
my equal fancy in his youthful look 
sit a divinity able to inchant 
queen to admire nay to adore his worth 
continue smile make summer on his cheek 
at his bright eye do Cupid warm his wing 
when he intend to fly at woman heart 
music and rich perfume be in his breath 
apt resemble aromatic wind 
that sing the phoenix exequy 

can my daughter 
so much decline the greatness of her spirit 
hereditary to her blood 
to affect a person mere for his smile 
effeminate carriage without any proof 
of manly valour in he 

you mistake 
his character though he can tread in peace 
a airy measure to the warble lute 
demean his action with that sweet deceit 
can cozen lady of their soul yet when 
the glorious war do summon he to the field 
he do excel in feat of active arm 
the able youth of arcady instruct 
old soldier martial discipline that those 
who have behold his sweetness in the court 
puzzle in faith believe that conquer Mars 
have clothe his fierceness in a Cupid shape 
to vanquish some more beauteous prize than be 
the blind god mother 

it be offensive I will hear no more of this 

thus I be enforce to prove 
dead to obedience if I live to love 

your niceness 
must not excuse the due respect we bear 
the lord Demagoras if the shepherd be prepare 
they shall present their mirth to expel his melancholy 

pish you be as fierce a aspen leaf you wag every way 

I will tell thou honest Strephon I 
no more affect a woman than the sky 
do bird that sore in it they be as vain 
inconstant as the fly shower of rain 
in April Strephon 

the more dissemble fellow you why do you protest to every wench you see you be enamour on she why you shall see and see aught to imitate your better Clitophon there be not a lass 
that trip nimble over the arcadian grass

some there be that do suppose 
love hot fire in my nose 
with which they scorch for pity cry 
blow it out Strephon or we die 
other say my head be a bell 
my hair the rope that ring the knell 
my tongue the clapper which though their death it ring 
they swear no Courefeu half so sweet sing 
the hollow of my eye the grave 
which with their nail they dig but have but who come here 

Strephon you be wellmet good Aminta see 
be he not chaste and fair as young goat be 
his head like to a cedar overgrow 
his stud cheek and rich enamel nose 

I will be loath to give my face for the wash 
girl now Clitophon do not you not imagine Venus girdle be 
my swathband the maid so dote on my well timber limb 
here be a leg Sapho that be as neat make 
as any that over shepherdess be lay 
a thigh proportionable I take it 
I know thou long to feel it naked 
a tail some say do hang thereby 
which none must know but thou and I 
I have a back too though I say it 
that shall not can bear any weight 
full limb with sinew strong and plump 
a lusty chine and for my rump 
it be so well make and firm knit 
the nymph be all stark mad for it 
because they think the rest of my member proportionable 

what a quick flame 
into my breast from Sappho bright eye come 
another from aminta my desire 
erst cold as ice grow active as the fire 
dear Aminta Sappho lend your ear 
to my just vow 

fond Clitophon forbear 
to swear in earnest I do know your heart 
be never wound with the blind god dart 

see how bright Strephon do entice the air 
to play with the sweet bellrope of his hair 
what a soft murmur the tress make 
as do Medusa lock or Allecto snake 

gentle virgin white as infant snow 
please as Ladon that do cool flow 
through our green meadow trust a love swain 
when he protest with truth 

there do remain 
no such good property among man on earth

by Venus be to pleasure bed 
there do soft embrace fight 
kiss combat with delight 
amorous look and sigh discover 
what will win a virginlover 

it be too effeminate this I have rather hear 
the cry of die man than these nice strain 
or soldier with loud clamour rend the air 
with shout of victory 

patience my lord the shepherd be proceed to dance 

I do not like this moral it include 
something that be distasteful a man possess 
with eminent frenzy that will a minute 
view these idle morrisdance 

that fellow 
that woo with such obsequiousness and win 
his yield mistress sure do represent 
effeminate Argalus the other who 
with confidence attempt be repulse 
figure myself this same be a abuse 
such as no hospitality nor law 
of true nobility can suffer madam 
you have do well and just I perceive 
you be as various in your giddy faith 
as your coy daughter in her choice reserve she 
for gracious Argalus but if this scorn 
meet not a sudden and severe revenge 
may all my former glory be obscure 
though to perform it I shall scale the star 
and snatch they like quick wildfire from their sphere 
then dart they on the earth catch the dull cloud 
and squeeze they into a deluge and aspire 
to startle jove with terror of my ire 

this be the sudden passion I have see 
whence have it its original my lord 
let we follow and persuade he 

my lord 
the fair Parthenia instruct all heart 
nobility with music of her voice 
miriads of joy be in her look her eye 
be nature rich diamond set in foil 
of polish ebony her breath expire 
odour more sweet than issue from the tree 
of balm in paradise 

Demagoras 
drink with opinion of himself decline 
as much her glorious merit as your just 
expression honour it 

it be sacrilege 
not to confess so manifest a truth 
it be she when first I do salute the war 
with my unable person who inspire 
my soul with courage active as the wind 
give i a manly be and infuse 
by the divine reflection of her love 
thought fiery as that passion I do live 
only her creature Borrow my poor heat 
from the extend virtue of her flame 

you be too modest 
to ascribe a great glory to my niece 
than the whole stock of woman ever boast 
you will make her proud my lord it be a excess 
of natural sweetness in you you must temper 
with a more moderate confidence 

alas my lord 
of more sincere devotion every think 
my fancy offer be a sacrifice 
to the bright deity of Parthenia 
who noble freeness though it may afford 
i entertainment more replete with grace 
than she bestow on every suitor yet 
my timorous hope dare not assume that life 
as to believe she love i pray my lord 
you be familiar with Parthenia thought 
resolve your friend this questionable doubt 
who her affection at purity have choose 
her love bless favourite 

my lord you know he 
he be your most intimate friend 

my friend 
be he my utmost enemy and belove 
of fair Parthenia that shall be a tie 
of adoration to i pray declare 
the man must be make fortunate with the title 
of lord of such perfection 

he be 
a noble generous and well manure youth 
bear beauty ensign in his gracious look 
have that supreme divinity in his eye 
as sparkle flame able to fire all heart 
and the superlative virtue of his mind 
transcend his outward figure he be wise 
as most mature age valiant in resolve 
as fame belove child reputation 
conjoin the masculine grace of his soul 
with lovely carriage and discreet discourse 
have not your knowledge reach he yet 

this character 
so far excel i undo my hope 

my lord be not to 
secure your peace I will not disclose this secret it be yourself 
it be Argalus Parthenia have receive 
a welcome guest into her open heart 
amaze not your quick sense it be a truth 

your mutual modesty 
defer your just desire I must become 
the moderator betwixt your bashful hope 
you do affect as timorous as swan 
cold as the brook they swim in who do bill 
with tardy modesty and chirr plead 
their constant resolution 

noble Argalus 
my honour brother pray heaven our entertainment 
be worthy your acceptance you must not expect 
that happy welcome here your house afford 
to such deserve guest my lord Philarchus 
see you the lord Demagoras late 

madam 
not since he fling last night hence in a rage 
from the presentment by the shepherd 

Demagoras 
be of so haughty a disposition 
though noble otherwise that I can wish 
no alliance with he sister I do fear 
you be too zealous to advance the match 
he and your Parthenia here be a lord 
as great by birth and great by the favour 
do he by the kingt but great by his own 
superlative goodness do affect she with 
so true a fancy that you much will wrong 
humanity to dispose she to another 
where such a merit suitor do pretend 
a holy interest in she 

good brother do not 
question my honour so much I be loath 
to give the least occasion of distaste 
to my lord Demagoras and since my daughter 
can affect he I conceive he will 
cease his unnecessary suit and leave she 
to her own disposure 

I wish it 
my lord and sister honour i to transfer 
your company to my castle it do stand 
oppress with solitude and mourn the lack 
of noble hospitality like a widow 
deprive of a love husband I do long 
to see dame Ceres crown with wreathe of wheat 
kiss plump cheek Bacchus there in daily feast 
to view my table furnish with such guest 
as will esteem it no trouble to adorn it 
a year or two together and there find 
no entertainment like a bounteous mind 

o Argalus 
it be her voice Parthenia voice she name 
her minion Argalus that sound though clothe 
in the enchant accent of her breath 
be harsh as screechowl or the whistler note 
and shall be fatal to she as the strain 
the siren dance on the peaceful sea 
bestow on wretched mariner Come forth 
employ your airy number on your own 
proud beauty epitaph 

what mean my lord 
this rude intrusion on my retire thought 
How dare you hand i thus uncivil man 
forbear this boldness 

persuade i to it 
when you can sing the world into a sleep 
or tame wild lightning with a tear you will best 
try if the pass sweetness of your tune 
can like the voice of magic charm my rage 
to pity or bring Argalus to your rescue 
will he be here and arm with sulphurous cloud 
like jove embrace Semele in fire 
this hand shall snatch thou from his circular flame 
to my revenge enforce he to behold 
helpless the present ruin of thy beauty 

your threat can affright i I defence 
with my own innocence fear not your malice 
shall it invade my life your foul intent 
will like a arrow shoot upright descend 
on your own head but pray declare my lord 
why you thus riot on my guiltless self 
if because I can love you I will die 
that cause martyr 

die your fate reserve you 
not to so brave a period as death 
from my great hand I will stick on thou a shame 
worse than the poor deprival of thy life 
such as will kill thou daily with conceit 
of thy unequalled misery 

perhaps 
he do intend my ravishment my lord 
mischief I see in your distract look 
pretend to my purity o do not 
murder my honour I will resign my breath 
with freedom to your fury Surely sir 
a virgin gore soon than blood of kid 
will mollify your heart of adamant 
to a soft fleshy substance 

do not prate 
nor with loud clamour fill the wood nor question 
what my intent be though you have not love i 
you need not in contempt have throw your heart 
on that effeminate Argalus that wrong 
fill my vast soul with horror and invite 
my active thought to a severe revenge 
since he who I can name but in contempt 
usurp my lawful privilege otherwise 
the injury with patience have be bear 
revenge cause be a immediate scorn 

gentle Aminta hear i 

have you do 
wind Meander first shall straight run 
rose in winter flourish and our flock 
wear golden fleece in stead of woolly lock 
ere Clitophon false heart do serious prove 
and entertain the perfectness of love 

it be her love to i make her slight Clitophon thus this it be to be a handsome man I shall dote short see my lovely Phisnomy in some clear spring the shepherd lookingglass on my own shadow and like Narcissus leap into the wave to embrace it 
which be she among the swain 
on who the gentle Strephon deign 
to cast a sheepseye nod or wink 
but do herself immortal think 
who indeed have such a face 
so full of a bewitch grace 
my head love pillow where he do rest 
as safe as Magpie in her nest 
my forehead sweet be bespread 
with violet and tulip blue and red 
the amber cowslip and the coral rise 
precious complexion of my sweet nose 
my eye be element from which fall shower 
that make my cheek a spring of several flower 
So be my head a nosegay grow on one stalk 
my body be the garden though it walk 
and there be no woman but may well 
to the bad part about it smell 
my arm be dragon that defend all these 
now view in i live hesperide 

who look on Strephon that will not suppose 
the blush peony grow in his nose 
the yellow primrose that in wood have wont 
to flourish spring up in his amber front 

I have a face of brass indeed shall I deny this for truth she will praise i short into the star and then I shall for a new planet be set in the the shepherd calendar what a gull be this Clitophon how long may he live ere he be in such favour with the shepherdess 
why when on he they will not gaze 
on i they stare with much amaze 
and when on he as on a clown 
with lower look they scowl and frown 
let gentle Strephon but vouchsafe 
to let they look on he they laugh 

o you be pleasant Strephon Sappho say 
be you as cruel as Aminta day 
love not the sunshine dear than my flame 
be equal devote to your name 
to your Aminta joint o you two 
be clear sweet than the morning dew 
fall in may on lily fair far 
than Venus swan or spotless ermine be 
which first vouchsafe i answer there do fly 
immediate comfort from aminta eye 
Sappho speak joy in smile but virgin here 
come beauty abstract who have no peer 
grace i dear Florida with one bless look 

away dissembler fish scorn the hook 
they see lay bare before they but prepare 
the other shepherd hither come be 
attend on my lady and her guest 
this music do invite we to Pan feast 

shepherd we owe our gratitude to your thanks

that grace our harmless festival 

I do admire we want my fair niece

Parthenia have bestow herself

be absent long see here she come 
madam you be expect here the shepherd 
do in their pastoral presentment move 
dull without your presence why thus veil 
extend your glorious beauty and eclipse 
the emulous day with brightness heaven protect i 
what strange delusion be this 

Surely a mist 
shade our amaze optic or have some 
black devil take her habitual form 
to mock our err fancy it be her face 
veil in a robe of darkness yet her eye 
shoot their accustom brightness through the cloud 
to tell the admire gazer two such light 
can endure privation horror friend 
what shall portend this ominous sight 
dear madam have you devise this emblem of disguise 
that when disperse it may give more perfect lustre 
to your most exquisite figure 

o my lord 
look not on such a monster lest my sight 
infect your spotless purity I be 
stop your innocent ear lest the harsh sound 
pierce they with horror poison 

what ignoble villain 
madam have spoil nature most glorious frame 
demolish such a beauty as the most 
cunning painter with their skill shall never imitate 

let she name 
guess at his appellation that have venture 
this irreligious blemish to white truth 
and be his heart wrap in a marble rock 
fence with a mine of adamant this hand 
shall from the stony casket dig it out 
and with his vile blood poison all the world 

dear sir the employment of this fruitless rage 
can attach he for this mischief it be 
Demagoras who mad with the conceit 
that for your sake I do neglect his love 
surprise my guiltless person in the wood 
and with a juice more poisonous than the foam 
of angry dragon sprinkle my clear face 
by the powerful venom straight over bespread with this 
contagious leprosy and then he flee 

whither what place can be so strong to guard 
so merciless a tiger shall he mix 
his conversation with unsettle air 
break like a cunning pioneer through the earth 
and hide himself in the centre some quick wind 
or hideous earthquake will enforce he thence 
to his deserve punishment o friend 
methinks this object shall affright the light 
into a sad concealment force the cloud 
to drop upon the earth in flood of tear 
and drown it everlasting 

Poor lady 

do not lord 
urge violent rage to discompose your peace I will like 
the please air wrap in that cloud my head 
that have infect it and seek out death 
nor do I grieve for my vain beauty loss 
since shiver sickness or the hand of age 
will have perform that office which his poison 
usurp upon its lustre this only wound 
my frail resolve since I believe that you 
lord Argalus affect i that I 
shall be so wretched as to be deprive 
of that indifferent form for which I may 
have merit your favour 

gracious soul 
enforce my immortality from my breast 
which like a flame enclose betwixt wall of brass 
strive to ascend to heaven and fetch from thence 
thy ravish beauty it be thy excellent mind 
that I admire no noble soul can fix 
only on fleshly glory and since that 
remain entire immovable as faith 
I shall undo my honour in revolt 
from sacred truth shall I renounce thy love 
I will yet embrace thy nuptial with a heat 
holy as altar incense for thy face 
a thousand virgin with immaculate tear 
shall weep upon it bathe it in their blood 
till from the different colour the fresh rose 
and glorious lily in that snowy field 
regain their ancient seat and recreate thou 
the absolute queen of beauty 

o my lord 
your fancy wander in distract path 
of vanquish reason since infortunate I 
must like a piece of alablaster 
by a unskilful carver needs become 
a most imperfect statue since I can 
boast any thing that be merit your love 
strive to forget Parthenia who will seek 
some desert where poor mortal never tread 
to spend the wretched remnant of her life in 
farewell my lord hereafter wish to meet

the glory of their beauty and you sir present 
my anger have invade they and spite 
of your defence convert their choice form 
to the same loathsome leprosy

heavens neversleeping justice that direct 
my err person hither to revenge

guard your black breast I will pierce it 

so valiant 
I shall chastise your fury

sure great Mars 
have put on arm against i in this shape 
for it be impossible mortality can 
achieve Demagoras conquest farewell light 
it be fit the world shall wear eternal night 

I hate to triumph 
over his loathe carcase which shall be a prey

where have you leave my lord 

there lie your lord

curse fate that so much greatness 
shall suffer this great overthrow and fall 
from such a height to a sad funeral 

it be such a cruelty as no report 
though it discourse of rape and timeless death 
have ever equal 

the success will speak 
the wonder more prodigious the poor lady 
still lovely in her sorrow after this sad rape 
of her rare beauty private steal thence 
and with that strictness have obscure herself 
that though inquest though many endeavour 
in her desire search can attain the least 
discovery of her present be 

how bear Argalus this sad disaster 

as a man 
who noble courage above the cross of fate 
seem patient at his misery 

he and I 
be both make up of sorrow our full grief 
may like two swell ocean when they meet 
in a contract channel apt combat 
for rough priority Philoclea 
my glorious cousin will by no entreat 
no service yet be induce to love 
that I be force against the natural zeal 
I bear the king my uncle to transgress 
such be the power of my fancy the strictness 
of my obedience captivate she 
by force to who by a most free consent 
my soul before be prisoner 

I can wish noble Amphialus that your desire 
may both achieve forgiveness and success 
I be none of those strict statesman though I love 
my king that hate your virtue for this fact 
because I know the greatness of your spirit 
attempt it not for inveterate hate 
or for ambition but to gain her love 

Philoclea love upon who mean thought 
the art of memory be ground and inspire 
each organ of our meditate sense 
with their perfection merit 

but my lord 
how brook the king the bold detention 
of his fair daughter sure he will invert 
some sudden force on you and compel 
their backdelivery 

he shall first enforce 
mortality into nothing I do send 
to avoid effusion of more humane blood 
this fair defiance that he shall elect 
a champion dare single to oppose 
i in a combat and if fate decree 
my fall by he security for the freedom 
of his imprison daughter 

do his grace accept the noble offer 

with a freedom 
fit a king but who the person be 
that hope to gain a trophy by my death 
fame have not yet divulge this urgent business 
hinder my visit of my lord Argalus 
present my true heart service to he tell he I 
do inward dissolve into a dew 
of bleed passion for his loss and will 
to reinvest bless quiet in his heart 
act over the scene of danger I have pass 
since I know early manhood so your lordship 
will please to pardon my rude haste I must 
as to my friend to my own affair be just 

persuade i not to this there be no woman 
worthy my love they be all too false common 
to every suitor 

why Clitophon say you so who be bless 
with her society who I love best 
yet in her presence I be forbid to move 
my suit nay dare not name the name of love 

it be your own flat foolery Alexis you shall with garb and gesture pastoral with as much scorn as you will overturn your enemy at football contemn the force of woman why 
woman be shadow fly away 
when follow or desire to stay 
but if you slight they they will sue 
follow entreat nay fly to you 
but if stiff and strong you stand 
you may tread they at command 
but lie down the pretty elf 
will straight fall under you of themselves 
like my spaniel beat they 
will lick your lip and with you play 
this be the reason why 
they love i so dogged 
you may by my example edify 
and live in peace Alexis 

why Strephon you usurp without a cause 
the privilege of their love your carriage draw 
their laughter not affection you appear 
to they for sport not for your person dear 

there be your foolery still thou have commerce it seem with none but thy own sheep and art far silly than they your woman be the great dissembler in the world and where they toy and jeer they most affect 
final woman be slippery as at their tail be eel 
their mind as light as be their heel 
and every one for what she feel 
and so with my opinion farewell 

stay honest Strephon I do late compose verse in hatred of they 

they be not prose pray read they 

who will trust a woman when 
they be the only curse of man 
siren sing but to entice 
they man to a fool paradise 
hyaena speak it be to betray 
to certain ruin so do they 
crocodile shed tear of slaughter 
woman weep when they mean laughter 
inconstant cruel false unkind 
be attribute that suit their mind 

now as I be true arcadian thou will be whip for this Cupid shall cite thou into his court for this by some of his villainous apparator where his wide conscience proctor and their clerk shall with their pen and inkhorn beat thy brain out if thou scape that lady shall beat thou to death with their monkey you jackanapes chambermaid shall worry thou to death with kiss than which there can be no great tyranny then the very cook and milkmaid shall in scold prose baste thou into a jelly or charm thou into maybutter you shall answer this I will peach I will play the informer 

I will not recant it not deny this truth 
Alexis you shall hear it justify 

where meet you lord Amphialus 

in the grove betwixt Mantinaea and his castle while 
our servant lead our horse down the hill 
we do exchange some accent in discourse 
the noble youth as hopeful of success 
in his design as brave in his resolve 
but the great rumour warfare betwixt the king 
and he be convert to a single fight 
betwixt Amphialus and what champion 
the king will venture to engage in such 
a cause of weighty consequence 

I be glad 
Arcadia long bless in a happy peace 
shall by the let of so few vein blood 
continue in her quiet it be fear 
this sad domestic quarrel will have cost 
more life than might with justice have be spare

have sort he so honourable a trial 
of his undoubted valour for my grief

into forgetfulness 

nay good my lord

hence to my castle expel our care with feast 
hunt the wild boar that will with masculine rage 
resist the hunter till he foam to death 
view swift hound run hot in pursuit 
of the chase game and from the neighbour hill 
force echo to their shrillness 

alas my lord 
the sole conceit of fair Parthenia loss 
will from a heart of marble force salt tear 
cold as the dew the stone distil invite 
a unremorseful crocodile to shed 
drop as sincere as do the timorous heart

his funeral dirge

a honour great on my sprightly hope 
than the addition of estate or blood

a honour which like the elder child of fame tread on the neck of glory 

Come my lord let we leave these happy lover to themselves

that act a honour upon which the loss 
of the unvalued treasure of your life 
have strict dependence sure my lord the king 
can be such a tyrant to employ 
you in your infant age of peaceful love 
to such a cruel warfare 

now I see Parthenia love not Argalus if she wish he 
turn recreant to his valour what account 
unless of coward shall I give the king 
shall I refuse this honourable task 
which but to meet I will scale starneighboring rock 
travel through desert scarce know to beast 
and combat all that dare oppose my passage 
to this brave enterprise

which you have utter but like mandrake groan 
or howl of wolf affright i can there be 
such a contempt of my regardless love 
be get so soon can you forsake my bed 
before I scarce conceive myself a wife 
or you a husband o Argalus I think 
we shall have live and teach the err world

that do with amorous mixture twine their bough 
into a leagueunion and so flourish 
old in each other arm when now if thou 
proceed to trial in this bloody task

as not Penean Daphne first transform 
can boast the like for freshness dry my love 
those sacred eye drown in crystal stream 
or if thou will I will kiss away thy tear 
in stead of heavenly nectar 

This but add to my misfortune sir I be your wife 
and never yet request any grant 
unless your love deny i not my first 
and only suit leave my good lord to tempt 
your destiny Amphialus be so good 
in his kind love to woman that I doubt not

can he spit thunder will affright the god 
or wear at each lock of his hair a flash 
of pierce lightning yet I shall attempt 
to snatch the very chaplet from his head 
and as a garland of victorious bay 
wreathe it about these temple

sweet Sappho will you still persist and kill who you may save

to afford our love a answer the kind grass 
that deck the plain will smile when we do fit 
on its green tapestry and apt fit 
our wild affection shepherdess let 
our woolly charge within our fold be set 
lest the hoarse wolf to sate his ravenous thirst 
with blood of lamb do through our weak flock burst

and there determine of our love I will strain 
a little on your patience to rehearse 
on the late nuptial this ensue verse

her virgin love when lo on either side 
stand as her handmaid chastity and truth 
with that immaculate guider of her youth 
rosecoloured modesty these do undress 
the beauteous maid who now in readiness 
the nuptial taper wave about her head 
make poor her garment and enrich her bed 
while the fresh bridegroom like the lusty spring 
do to the holy bridebed with he bring 
attend masculine virtue down he lay 
his snowy limb by a far white maid

Come let we depart

I can have wish the king 
have destine any to this fatal task 
but noble Argalus in he there rest 
such a command fullness of true worth 
that as it will be a glory to overcome 
it will be a grief equal to think against who 
the present fury of my arm must be 
unwilling direct 

famous Amphialus 
it be so much honour to be hold your friend 
it be indiscretion in i to admit 
a thought of be your enemy we two 
shall meet my lord to revel not to fight 
but since the injustice of our fate do force 
this sad contention dear Amphialus 
think that two brother may with hot resolve 
strive to achieve one crown yet still be friend 
the laurel destine for my head will wither 
if it be snatch from thou 

more famous Argalus 
under who hand the great Demais fall 
these attribute of courtesy do speak 
your noble nature freeness you and I 
shall rather exercise our able arm 
in one another quarrel than employ they 
upon ourselves dear Argalus our fate 
be too in just to engage our sword against 
our body for in harm thou I offer 
wound to myself we two retain so much 
affinity by friendship we must needs be 
one individual substance 

good my lord 
since there be that sympathy of love and nature 
twixt your two soul dissolve it not the blow 
that shall divide your heart will be more impious 
in separate that union than in cut 
your twist of life asunder 

Philarchus you be so noble 
our will desire you a indifferent judge 
in our unwilling difference since you be 
a equal friend to both 

Philarchus 
we two be fortune scorn that we shall be 
such friend in soul yet by our deed be think 
severe enemy dear Argalus 
let not thy lenity regard my life 
which be so worth less it be a weight I wish 
rather to lose than keep but guard thy own 
preserve that precious blood which I shall grieve 
to see diffuse on earth nay rather weep 
than shed a drop of it 

how much my lord you vanquish he with courtesy 
who your arm mean to conquer but Amphialus 
since we be mutual friend and yet must seem 
mutual enemy to testify 
it be by our fate not malice we be foe 
I will make thou my full executor bestow 
a gift upon thou of that priceless worth 
posterity shall never boast its parallel 
when I be ash if there be a wretch 
for some there be that dare blaspheme the god 
do injure my Parthenia prithee friend 
let be thy care to punish that contempt 
against virtuous purity and as the last 
and most supreme inducement of my love 
if by thy hand I perish let my heart 
be send to my Parthenia

convey to my Philoclea and if fame 
as it may chance traduce i after death

may black her precious memory and say 
a worthless man fall by thy sword 
let we embrace my Argalus and take 
a true though sad farewell and once 
let we employ our hand against our heart 

kill ourselves mutual for who first do fall 
lead but the way to the other funeral 

eternal darkness seize i oh my lord 
you be report to be thrall to love 
for her sake you affect most do not make 
a breach in ebb nature more this blood 
clothe the grass in purple do convert 
my heart to alabaster o Argalus 

o Parthenia never till now unwelcome have I live 
to such a abject lowness that my life 
must like a malefactor be by prayer 
redeem from death let we renew the fight 
ha methinks I tread on slippery glass my unsupporting foot 
dance measure on light wave and I be sink 
into the watery bosom there to rest for all eternity 

I have see 
so die taper as it be to light 
their own sad funeral expire dart 
be but stir their most illustrious beam 
and so extinguish 

angel if you have charity afford 
some surgery from heaven now I see the cause 
why my sad heart fill with prophetic fear 
seek to have stop your journey and why I 
compel by power of overruling fate 
follow you hither o Argalus 

Parthenia I do feel 
a marble sweat about my heart which do 
congeal the remnant of my blood to ice 
my lord I do forgive you friend farewell 
Parthenia shower on my pale lip a kiss 
it will waft my soul to its eternal bliss 
Parthenia oh Parthenia 

So crack the cordage of his heart as Cable

of some big tempest my lord your wound be many 
and dangerous it be fit you do withdraw 
and have they cure 

I be careless grow my life

grief individual substance pray forgive i

your lord love life but a necessitous force 
to save my own joy comfort you thus fate

dear madam calm your passion and resolve 
to arm your soul with patience 

patience sir

I can stand silent here a age to view 
this goodly ruin noble Argalus 
if thou have die degenerate from thyself 
I shall have flow with pity till my tear 
have drown thy blast memory but since 
thou perish noble let thy soul expect 
a joy not sorrow from i the green oak 
laurel and lovely myrtle shall still flourish 
about thy sepulchre which shall be cut 
out of a mine of diamond yet the brightness 
proceed from thy ash shall outshine 
the stone unvalued substance 

sure she be grow insensible of her grief or fall 
into some wild distraction 

you mistake 
it be not a fury lead i to this strange 
demeanour but conceit that I shall sin 
against my Argalus shall I lament 
his overthrow no bless soul 
augment the illustrious number of the star 
outshine the ledan brother I will not diminish 
thy glory by a tear until my breast 
do like the pious pelican break forth 
in purple fountain for thy loss and then 
it shall diffuse for every drop thou shed 
a crimson river then to thou I will come 
to die for love be a glorious martyrdom 

it be certain my Alexis have not I 
who in their presence for love daily die 
a cause to blame my destiny and be 
oppress with a continual melancholy 

you be your own oppressor 

o wretched fate 
I in their presence dote on every one 
yet in their absence be content with none 

yet I be in a far worse case 
than any of you both alas 
this villain Cupid play the knave 
or at my birth his mother give 
some of her beauty to my natural part 
which do allure even stony heart 
that I be weary of so many 
good part and will lend some to any 
i Clitophon even every limb 
about thou can with beauty trim 
and never miss I dare be swear 
there be not a inch about i wear 
which have not all the maid can tell 
wait on it of love a ell 

o far more happy Strephon 

I do mock I Alexis I will surrender you 
that happiness with all my heart 
Were there but only two or three 
or four or five do dote on i 
I grant you then it be very well 
the handsome then shall hear the bell 
but there be not in this face a wrinkle 
nor on my precious nose a pimple 
nor a hair upon my chin 
but those you see be very thin 
nor any squint come from my eye

and change their mind more than their smock

and tongue that lie worse than false clock 
by which they catch man like jack in a box 
and so with my curse I leave they 

it will be the safe way my lord and which 
will best suit with your honour be a mean 
to gain fair Philoclea 

that bless name 
charm i to adoration oh my lord 
Philoclea love be like a i of wealth 
guard by watchful dragon there attend 
legion of fear and unrelenting thought 
on the unvalued treasure 

I can wish you will express a more indulgent care 
towards yourself you see the angry king 
grieve for his daughter and Zelmane loss 
attempt whatever may invade your life 
I shall endeavour your reconcilement with he but my lord 
farewell I know you wait some opposite I wish 
your action crown with a deserve success 

thus honest lord engage my observance how my fate 
play the sly tyrant with i and involve 
my thought in kill passion flame meet flame 
with equal resolution and contend 
like Cadmus earthborn brother to destroy 
each other by their fury fear kill hope 
but a new rise from the former urn 
take vengeance on the murderer wretched I 
live as to live be every hour to die 
a most sad apparition suit well 
the inward horror of my mind this knight 
sure shall not be my enemy he fight 
under my very colour noble youth 
if what your outward figure speak do challenge 
relation to your mind I see no cause 
we shall endanger our mortality 
in this infortunate quarrel there appear 
so great a outward sympathy it tell 
my soul we shall not combat 

teach your fear 
this fruitless hope I come not hither arm 
with resolution big as fate to part 
overcome with airy treaty soon think 
to charm the genius of the world to peace 
when earthquake have affright it than with 
wellworded eloquence to decline the height 
of my wake wrath 

sir you promise 
a early conquest over i but there rest 
in i a manly pity will not stain 
my conquer hand in your too innocent blood 
I will not have your virtue gentle youth 
be like a towards cedar overwhelm 
by a outrageous tempest blast ere 
it come to full growth if for honour cause 
and to achieve fame you attempt my life 
let i desire you to employ your force 
on some less fortunate warrior I be loath 
to triumph in the guiltless spoil of your 
yet bloom honour 

Read thy friend this dialect of cowardice 
know to incense thou more I be one that hate 
thy dear Philoclea with so dire a spite 
that I pronounce she one who live upon 
the spoil of innocent virtue that have cause 
guiltless effusion of more noble blood 
than ever fill she or your base vein 

then I see you come to rail and must chastise the wrong 
you do inflict on she who spotless soul 
be so much ignorant of the least guilt 
it understand it not recant this wrong 
opinion of her purity and leave off 
to wake a anger that have rather sleep 
than rise to hurt you 

I see then I must add 
new truth to affright your cowardice your mistress 
be the decay of more fameworthy soul 
than she have hair or vain bewitch look 
to enthrall your wanton passion on your heart 
my sword shall write this for a serious truth 
and underneath it that unworthy lie 
you have pronounce in justify her free 
from my just affirmation 

fiend can never have so incense i 
bless i sure some angel enter 
into arm against my unworthy self 
those golden lock sure be Pallas headtire or the queen 
of love have mask herself in Mars his shape 
so to betray my luckless arm to slaughter 
of the world exquisite beauty 

now my joy 
exceed the great trophy Argalus 
methinks I see he ride in a chariot draw by dove 
cut the bright firmament and there attend 
my wish ascension 

some mountain that 
have stand the long rage of time unloose 
its stony root fall on i that I never 
may be on earth remember dear lady 
look up and let i shower a flood of tear 
into your wound distraction seize i may I 
like some black prodigy contemn by light 
never be more distinguish 

nay my lord 
do not let passion discompose your thought 
you have do a office for i that blot out 
all my conceit of hatred pray forgive i 
I injure your Philoclea arm for death 
I come to have it from that hand which slay 
my Argalus weep not girl 
I do not need your moist religious tear 
to usher i to heaven look how a host 
of saint lover on their turtle wing 
conduct by my Argalus approach 
to waft i to Elysium take my breath 
that fly to thou on the pale wing of death 
Argalus oh Argalus 

can I retain mortality and behold 
this impious act of my dire fate this piece 
of new demolish nature be it place 
for its own ivory figure on a tomb 
of pure alabaster will be think 
one with the stone white substance maid convey 
your lady body hence while I depart 
to find a grief out that may break my heart 

hapless lady 
let we resolve not to outlive she but 
like constant servant wait upon in death 
our murder mistress 

our poor life can 
redeem her loss not pacify her ghost 
for her late slaughter I have compose 
a elegy on her death and beauty hear it 
happy arabian when your phoenix die 
in a sweet pile of fragrant spicery 
out of the ash of the myrrhburned mother 
that you may still have one spring up another 
unhappy we since it be your phoenix nature 
why can not we our only matchless creature 
enjoy that right why from Parthenia urn 
shall not Parthenia glorious return 
o there be a reason it be because nature store 
all spend on she be now become too poor 
to frame her equal so that on her hearse 
my tremble hand shall hang this funeral verse 
true love and beauty none can boast to have 
they both be bury in Parthenia grave 
who be love glory beauty virtue pride 
with her love glory virtue beauty die 
now girl 
strew flower upon the body while our tear 
imbalm her memory and whatever ear 
shall hear this story may with justice say 
none love like Argalus and Parthenia
