thy friend thou come with expectation 
to hear i talk sense do not 

yes 

la now 
and to discourse as I be wont of state 
our friendship or of woman no such matter 

this be more wild than usual your language 
I not so clear as it be wont it carry 
not the same even thread although some word 
may knit the sense be scatter 

right right Cosmo 
the reason be I have straggle 
and lose myself I know not where in what 
part of the world and will not this be show 
as well in he to have prepare thou now 

what humour be this Pisano I be yet to understand 

to understand why Cosmo 
have I not change my dialect and method 
what need this tedious apology 
that be it I will have have thou know before 
thou can not understand i yet thou have 
a name in Florence for a ripe young man 
of nimble apprehension of a wise 
and spread observation of who 
already our old man do prophesy 
good and great thing worthy thy fair dimension 

this be a argument above the rest 
Pisano be not well for be temperate 
he be not wont to flatter and abuse 
his friend 

beside there be another reason 
thou shall discover i at heart through all 
these mist thou be in love too and who can 
that feel himself the heat but shrewd guess 
at every symptom of that wanton fever 
o Cosmo 

what misfortune can approach 
your happy love in fair Amidea 
you have be long contract and have pass 
the tedious hope Hymen do only wait 
a opportunity to light his torch 
which will burn glorious at your nuptial 
let jealous lover fear and feel what it be 
to languish talk away their blood and strength 
question their unkind star you have game 
before you sir 

before i where why do 
thou mock i Cosmo she be not here 

it be 
no pilgrimage to travel to her lip 

it be not for you 

how sir for i you have no 
suspicion I can be guilty of 
a treason to our friendship be so just 
if malice have be busy with my fame 
to let i know 

you hasty interpret 
thy pardon I have only err but not 
with the least scruple of thy faith and honour 
to i thou have a noble soul and love i 
rather too well I will thou be my enemy 
that we have be bear in distant clime and never 
take cement from our sympathy in nature 
will we have never see or know each other 
this may seem strange from he that love thou Cosmo 
more precious than his life 

love i and wish 
this separation 

I will give thou proof 
so well I love thou nothing in the world 
thy soul do hearty affect but I 
do love it too do it not trouble thy 
belief I wear not my own heart about i

but what be all this to thou go to Oriana 
and bathe thy lip in rosy dew of kiss 
renew thy eye that look as Saturn hang 
upon the lid take in some golden beam 
she will dart a thousand at one glance and if 
at thy return thou find I have a be 
in this vain world I will tell thou more 

but sir you must not part so 

not with my good will 
I have no great ambition to be mad 

Petruchio let i conjure thou tell 
what weight hang on thy master heart why do he 
appear so full of trouble 

do you not guess 

point at the cause I can 

why he love 

the beauteous Amidea I know that 

some such thing be but you be his friend my lord 
his soul be now devote to Oriana 
and he will die for she if this ague hold he

but never a woman in the world shall make 
i hang myself it may be for his honour 
he will choose another death he be about one 
for it be not possible without some cure 
he shall live long he have forget to sleep 
and for his diet he have not eat this sevennight 
as much as will choke a sparrow a fly be 
a epicure to he good sir do you counsel he 
So so it work exit Cos

have be he engine in the work to batter 
his love to Amidea by praise 
Oriana to he he be here my lord

I have discover his disease and I 
beseech you interrupt they not 

this may 
have tragical effect Petruchio 
for Cosmo we shall prune his fortune thus 
Oriana wealth will swell he in the seat

my lord you buy my life when you procure 
my pardon from the duke 

o friend thou can not be so merciful 
to give away such happiness my love 
be for some sin I have commit thus 
transplant I look rather thou shall kill i 
then give away this comfort it be a charity 
will make thou poor and it be a great deal better 
that I shall languish still and die 

while I have art to help thou Oriana 
and I be but in treaty howsoever 
I be not worthy to be call his friend 
who I prefer not to a mistress if 
you can find dispensation to quit

he that speak it I be in a fine pickle 

I have read 

no blush not tremble read again 
the substance be that you maintain 
a vigilant eye over Lorenzo who 
have threaten with your death his country liberty 
and other thing touch reduce of 
a common wealth 

I like not that 

all be out 
a pox upon he for a traitor he

what answer 
make you to this Lorenzo 

this of the sudden 
sir I must owe the title of a traitor 
to your high favour envy first conspire 
and malice now accuse but what story 
mention his name that have his prince bosom 
without the people hate it be sin enough 
in some man to be great the throng of star 
the rout and common people of the sky 
move still another way then the sun do 
that guild the creature take your honour back 
and if you can that purple of my vein 
which flow in you and you shall leave i in 
a state I shall fear the great one envy

by such a hasty bloody disposition 
the rabble hate i now how shall I then 
expect a safety be it reformation 
of Florence they accuse i of suggest 
I disaffect a monarchy which how 
vain and ridiculous will appear in i 
your wisdom judge in you I live and flourish 
what in your death can I expect to equal 
the riches I enjoy under your warmth 
shall I for the air and talk of a new government 
a common wealth lose all my certainty 
and you above they all who favour have 
fall like the dew upon i have I a soul 
to think the guilt of such a murder easy 
be there no other torment or can I 
expect the people will reward your murderer 
with any thing but death a parricide 

so so the duke be already in his circle 

but I be tame as if I have no sense 
nor other argument to vindicate 
my loyalty thus poison by a paper 
in my eternal fame and by a slave 
call to my brow some one that dare accuse i 
let he have honour great as i to forfeit 
or since your grace have take i so near 
your own height that may seal may not expect 
such a proportion adversary yet let he 
have name within his country and allow he 
a soul against which I may engage my more 
then equal honour then I will praise your justice 
but let he not be one condemn already 
a desperate exile be it possible 
a treason hatch in Florence against the duke

of Salviati who for his cardinal cap 
in Rome be potent and here popular 

none but Lorenzo 

admirable traitor 

who service be commend when the exile 
one of who tribe accuse i have raise 
commotion in our Florence when the hindga 
of state do faint under the burden and 
the people sweat with their own fear to think 
the soldier shall inhabit their calm dwelling 
who then rise up your safety and crush all

well go thy way for one of the most excellent 
impudent traitor 

yet a murmur 
of a traitor we shall soon suspect he 
that think Lorenzo guilty 

I my lord 
dare bold swear his honour be as free 
from any treason as myself 
I do prophesy this issue 

it be a age 
till night I long to fold she in my arm 
prepare Sciarrha but be very wise 
in the discovery he be all touchwood 

I know he be her brother leave the manage 
of thing to i 

still when we expect 
our bliss time creep but when the happy thing 
call to enjoy each saucy hour have wing 

my sister though he be the duke he dare not 
patience patience if there be such a virtue 
I want it heaven yet keep it a little long 
it be a sin to have it such a injury 
deserve a wrath next to your own my sister 
it have throw wildfire in my brain Lorenzo 
a thousand fury revel in my skull 
have he not sin enough in his court to damn he 
but my roof must be guilty of new joust 
and none but Amidea these the honour 
his presence bring our house 

temper your rage 

be all the brothel rifle no quaint piece 
leave he in Florence that will meet his hot 
and valiant luxury that we be come 
to supply his blood out of our family 
disease gnaw his title off 

my lord 

he be no prince of i he forfeit 
his greatness that black minute he first give 
consent to my dishonour 

then I be sorry 

why shall you be sorry sir 
you say it be my sister he will strumpet 
i Amidea it be a wound you feel not 
but it strike through and through the poor Sciarrha 
I do not think but all the ash of 
my ancestor do swell in their dark urn 
at this report of Amidea shame 
it be their cause as well as i and shall 
heaven suffer the duke sin to pass unpunished 
their dust must of necessity conspire 
to make a earthquake in the temple 

sir 
you say you will hear i out 

why be there more 
behind 

and great master your high blood 
till I conclude Sciarrha I accuse not 
your noble anger which I have observe 
be not on every cheap and giddy motion 
inflame but sir be thrifty in your passion 
this be a petty trespass 

have mischief any name 
beyond this will it kill i with the sound 

my lord though the dishonour your sister 
be such a fact the blood of any other 
but Alexander can no less than expiate 
yet this sin stretch far and involve 
with she your great stain do you ever promise he 
yet why do I make any question 
it be another crime to think Sciarrha 
can entertain a thought so far beneath 
his birth you stoop to such a horrid baseness 
than all the virtue of mankind will sicken 
and soon take leave of earth 

you torture i 

what then can the duke find to give he any 
encouragement you will be guilty of 
a act so fatal unto honour what 
when you be least yourself as we be all 
frail composition do appear so wicked 
in you he shall conceive a hope and flatter 
himself with possibility to corrupt 
your soul to a deed so monstrous 

to what 

though all the teem glory of his dukedom 
nay Florence state offer it self a bribe 
and tempt the betray of your name 
to infamy yet to imagine you 
will turn officious pander to his lust 
and interpose the mercenary bawd 
to court your sister to his sinful couple 
it be horrid affright nature I grow stiff 
with the imagination 

hah 

yet this be his command I shall impose 

Lorenzo 
I do want breath my voice be ravish from i 
I be not what I be or if I be 
Sciarrha thou have talk too all this while 
look heedful about i and thou may 
discover through some cranny of my flesh 
a fire within my soul be but one flame 
extend to all part of this frail building 
I shall to ash I begin to shrink 
be not already my complexion alter 
do not my face look parch and my skin gather 
into a heap my breath be hot enough 
to thaw the Alps 

your fancy will 
transport you 

it be my rage but let it cool 
and then we will talk of something something sir 
shall be to purpose 

now the flame be mount 
my lord I have give proof although he be 
my duke and kinsman I abhor his vice 
however the world without examination 
shoot their malicious noise and stain my action 
it be policy in prince to create 
a favourite who must bear all the guilt 
of thing ill manage in the state if any 
design be happy it be the prince own 
heaven know how I have counsel this young man 
by virtue to prevent his fate and govern 
with modesty oh the religious day 
of commonwealth 
we have outlive that blessing 

but I have think a cure for this great state 
impostume 

what 

to lance it be it not ripe 
let we draw cut whether your hand or i 
shall do a act for Florence liberty 
and send this tyrant to another world 

how I draw cut 

coy it not thus Lorenzo 
but answer by thy name and birth you be 
his kinsman we all know it that you dwell 
in his bosom great in favour as in blood 
we know that too and let i tell you more 
we know you but disguise your heart and wish 
Florence will change her title 

how be this 

we know you have firm correspondence with 
the banish man who desperate fortune wait 
your call to tumult in our street all this 
not to feed your ambition with a dukedom 
by the remove of Alexander but 
to serve your country and create their peace 
who groan under the tyranny of a proud 
lascivious monarch be it not true Lorenzo 
my phrase be blunt my lord 

my genius 
and thou be friend I see they have converse 
and I applaud the wisdom of my star 
that make i for his friendship who preserve 
the same religious fire I will confess 
when Alexander leave his piety 
to Florence I place he beneath my country 
as we shall all but we have lose our soul 
or change our active spirit for a dull 
and lazy sufferance let this secret be 
an argument how much I dare repose 
upon Sciarrha honour virtue witness 
I choose no other destiny command 
Lorenzo fate dissolve i with your breath 
I will either ive in your exchange of faith 
a patriot or die my country martyr 

thou have a fire beyond Prometheus 
to quicken earth thy flame be but a prophecy 
of that high pyramid the world shall build 
to thy immortal name it be the glory 
of roman to prefer their empire safety 
to their own life they be but man like we 
and of the same ingredient our soul 
create of no inferior substance ha 

heaven know I have no particular design 
to leap unto a throne I will disclaim 
the privilege of blood let i advance 
our liberty restore the ancient law 
of the republic rescue from the jaw 
of lust your mother wife your daughter sister

nor must you without i dispose yourself 
pray give access to none yet if Pisano 
inquire direct he to the garden Cosmo 
be young and promise but while Lorenzo 
life must expect no sunshine 

there be for thy pain 
they be now at opportunity 

my lord 
do you prepare the mother and let I close 
with Oriana 

what service can reward thou 

take occasion 
to leave we private this hour be 
propitious win but the matron to you

take the other walk 

my dear Cosmo 

my best Oriana 

you have be too much absent I must chide you 

you can sweet I will I know which way 
to make thou angry yes that I may see 
how well it will become thou I do fear 
thou be some angel and that sin will be 
a argument to i that thou be mortal 
I must suspect thy too much goodness else 
and leave thou for the fellowship of saint 
I be too wicked 

you will make i angry 

but you will love i still I fear 

do you fear it 
be it a misfortune 

what 

my love 

your anger 
and yet the other often time may carry 
a evil with it we may love to well 
and that be a fault 

not where the object good 

oyes always beware of the extreme 

what mean you I affect none but my Cosmo 
nor he with too much flame 

if you shall lady it be 
not noble do 

to love another 

yes 
if there be cause that may be call a virtue 
for what have I to engross the affection 
of any lady if she can discern 
a great merit in some other man 
wisdom forbid but she command her smile 
to warm and cherish he 

so we shall be inconstant 

why not if our reason be 
convince that be no such fault as the world go 
let we examine all the creature read 
the book of nature through and we shall find 
nothing do still the same the star do wander 
and have their diverse influence the element 
shuffle into innumerable change 
our constitution vary herb and tree 
admit their frost and summer and why then 
shall our desire that be so nimble and 
more subtle than the spirit in our blood 
be such stay thing within we and not share 
their natural liberty shall we admit a change 
in small of thing and not allow it in 
what most of all concern we 

what 

Oure love 

have you a suspicion I be change and thus 
will school i for it or shall I imagine 
that you be alter 

yes I be and therefore 
proclaim thy freedom I do love thou less 
to show I love thou more 

what riddle be this 

I will explain upon maturity 
of council Oriana I have find 
I be not worthy of thou therefore come 
to make thou satisfaction for my sin 
of love thou by point out a way 
and person will become thy affection better 

you have a pretty humour 

what do think 
of brave Pisano shall his merit plead 
succession in thy chaste thought 

I do know he 

thou can not choose and I can study none 
worthy thy love but he 

it be very likely you will resign then 

I to honour thou 
his service will deserve thou at the best 
and rich value 

why it shall be so 

nay but be serious and declare i happy 
that I may say I have make thou just amends 
I will thank thou 

why sir I do love he 

o when do Cupid aim that golden shaft 
but do thou love he perfect with a 
desire when sacred rite of marriage 
be pass to meet he in thy bed and call he 
thy husband 

why sir do you ever think 
I be so take with your worth and person 
I can not love another lord as well 
by your favour there be many as proper man 
and as deserve you may save your plea 
and be assure I need no lesson to 
direct my fancy I do love Pisano 
before but for your sake I mean to place he 
a great deal near sure he do but jest you do love i 

now by my heart I love thou 

this act shall crown our story Oriana 
thou do not know how much thou honour i 
for he be not in the common list of friend 
and he do love thou past imagination 
next his religion he have place the thought 
of Oriana he sleep nothing else 
and I shall wake he into heaven to say 
thou have consent to be he 

pray tell i 
but true I beseech you do you wish 
Pisano i indeed be you jealous 
and name he to accuse i 

not by goodness 
but if there be a charm beyond thy innocence 
by that I will conjure thou Oriana 
love he and make three happy it shall be 
my bliss to call you his let i but o wne 
a servant in your memory 

unkind 
and cruel Cosmo do thou think it possible 
I can love any but thyself thou will 
undo my heart for ever 

you shall be 
ever most welcome if I be her mother 
she must declare obedience Oriana 

go cheerful thy mother call to he 
who orator I have be alas poor lady 
I half repent i since she be so constant 
but a friend life weigh down all other love 
beside I thus secure my fate Lorenzo 
threaten my spring he be my enemy 

you will not compel affection 

no but court it 
with honour and religion thus invite it 

I shall forget the nature of a parent 
unless you show more softness and regard 
to what be urge what promise can you make 
to Cosmo without i or if you have 

here Cosmo do give up all title to it 
I have no part in Oriana now 

I have hear too much do with i what you please 
I be all passive nothing of myself 
but a obedience to unhappiness 

follow she Pisano

I accuse your good honour for what I beseech you 

for high treason you blockhead 

I must be acquaint with some particular first 

mass thou say right why imagine do you hear you must but imagine that some greatman have a conspiracy against the duke person and that I be a honest lord and one of this great man friend have be draw in for that be the plain truth on it it be against my will but that be all one well thou understand i show thy wit Rogero scratch thy nimble pericranium and thunder out my accusation ex tempore here I stand signior Depazzi ready to answer the indictment

why you rascal 

peace sirrah peace nay your lordship shall find he very audacious this fellow not content to have his branch spread within the city I speak it to his face let he deny it be afterward by the corruption of his confederate and the mere grace of his highness raise to honour receive infinite favour from his prince of bless memory yet like a wretch a villain a viper a rat of Nilus he have practise treason against the sacred person of the duke for which he deserve not only to die but also to suffer torture whip rack strappado wheel and all the fiery brazen bull that can be invent as I shall make it appear to this honourable and illustrious court 

this rogue transport 

with all my heart I obey your lordship thus then I pass from these circumstance and proceed to the principal villainy that we have to lay to his charge imprimis thou signior Depazzi do offer to a groom a 100 crown to poison his highness hunt saddle 

do I 

do not interrupt i varlet I will prove it his hunt saddle and woe shall be unto thy breech therefore and find this serpentine treason break in the shell do but lend your reverend ear to his next design I will cut they off present this irreligious nay atheistical traitor do with his own hand poison the duke prayer book o impiety and have his highness as in former time he accustom but pray once in a month which by special grace he omit how fatal have it be to Florence but as by justice his excellence do then and by his own want of devotion prevent this assassinate purpose so we hope in his own discretion and the council of his state he will take heed how he pray hereafter while he live to which every true subject will say amen 

may it please your honour 

thou impudent brazen face traitor will thou deny it more over and like your good lordship he have for this fortnight or three week before his apprehension walk up and down the court with a case of pistol charge wherewith as he partly confess he intend to send the duke to heaven with a powder 

this rogue will undo the devil at invention may it please this honourable

I confess and please your good lordship

that be the the way to be send of a headless errand indeed I confess that I never intend any treason to his highness nor ever seek the prince life true it be that I hear of a conspiracy 

that that my lord have overthrow he he say he never seek the prince life ergo he seek his death beside he have hear of treason now he that hear and discover not be equal guilty in fact for in offence of this nature there be not accessary ergo he be a principal and be a principal traitor he deserve condemnation 

shall I not speak 

no traitor must not be suffer to speak for when they have leave they have liberty and he that be a traitor deserve to be close prisoner 

all that this fellow have utter be false and forge abominable lie 

I will speak truth and I will be hear and no man else in this place 

I never dream of a hunt saddle nor never have so much as a thought of any prayer book 

you sit hear to do justice I speak for the duke and the safety of the common wealth 

as for pistol it be well know I can never endure the report one they I defy powder and shot as I do he that accuse i 

I defy all the world that will hear a traitor speak for himself it be against the law which provide that no man shall defend treason and he that speak for himself be a traitor do defend his treason thou be a capital obstreperous malefactor

a lady as Amidea now by Hymen 
it be not so honourable he need not scorn 
such a alliance 

I be not to give 
account for my lord action let he answer 
and justify his honour but my lord

Petruchio thou do hit my instruction rare 
and I applaud thou now send in Depazzi and visit i anon 

I shall my lord 

some politician 
that be not wise but by a precedent 
will think i weak for use such a instrument 
as this Depazzi but I know by proof 
such man who fear and honour make our creature 
do prove safe engine fool will still obey 
when cunning knave our confidence betray 

my lord I will speak a word or two in private 

you may 

be nobody within hear all clear behind the arras 

make no doubt sir 

my lord the truth be I be very fearful be your lordship sure there be no eaves dropper 

what need this circumstance I pray come to the point 

it be not unknown to your lordship that you have be my very good lord neither be I ignorant that I be your humble servant you advance man bring i into the number of the noble and I bring you a reasonable number of crown I be not the first wise citizen that have be convert into a foolish courtier but my lord I beseech you pardon i it will out

with what 

treason treason now it be out and I feel my body the light for it already the last plot do not take you see and I will humble entreat your lordship to excuse i and get somebody else hereafter to be your traitor in my stead

the gamester in Elysium Amidea 
you will allow beneath this roman dame 

Lorenzo have the burn ravisher 
make this attempt on Amidea she 
will have compel his penitence to quench 
his fire with holy tear I have a body

a thousand wing methinks I can have fly 
and kiss the cheek of Cynthia thence with ease 
have leap to Venus star but I be wound 
and the gay feather in who pride I have

I will impose no more 
restraint than your own house you be honourable 
you have many severe enemy the duke 
look gracious upon Pisano but 

you shall lose the small beam of favour 
to buy a man so desperate I never 
think death the monster that weak man have fancy 
as foil to make we more in love with life 
the devil picture may affright poor fowl 
into their body paleness but the substance 
too resolute man be a shadow and cold sweat 
dare not approach his forehead I be arm 
to die and give example of that fortitude 
shall shame the law severity my sister 
may now give back Pisano his false vow 
to line his coffin one tear shed on i be 
enough the justice I have do shall make 
my memory belove 

I have think a way

dare you consent 

to any thing that be noble 
although I never fear to suffer I 
be not so foolish to despise a life 

there be no difficulty attend it listen 
the time will not permit much circumstance 
the duke you know do love your sister 

vicious 

her virtue do but cool he for the present 
as sprinkling on a flame he be now more passionate 
to enjoy she 

ha 

if she consent to meet 
his soft embrace with his first kiss he seal 
your pardon than the act upon Pisano 
appear a true revenge when none dare question it 
beside addition of state and fortune 
to you and Amidea weigh your danger 
and what a trifle she give up to save 
your life that never can be value 
less recompense the duke may be so take 
with her return to his delight who know 
but he may marry she and discharge his duchess 
with a quaint salad you do apprehend i 

and repent more I have one good thought of thou 
than I have kill a thousand save my life 
and prostitute my sister though I have 
no weapon I will look thou dead or breathe 
a damp shall stifle thou that I can vomit 
consume flame or stone like Aetna make 
the earth with motion of my foot shrink low 
and take thou in alive o that my voice 
can call a serpent from corrupt Nile 
to make thou part of her accurse bowel 
be this noble friendship readiness 
to save my life let malice read all story 
famous for cruelty awake dead tyrant 
or be instruct by their ghost with torture 
such as will make a damn fury weep 
only to see inflict I will bear they 
and weary my tormentor ere consent 
in thought to thy temptation 

I have do 
and praise your heathen resolution 
of death go practice immortality 
and tell we when you can get leave to visit 
this world again what fine thing you enjoy 
in hell for thither these rash passion drive thou 
and ere thy body have three day inhabit 
a melancholy chamber in the earth 
hang round about with skull and dead man bone 
ere Amidea have tell all her tear 
upon thy marble or the epitaph 
belie thy soul by say it be flee 
to heaven this sister shall be ravish 
maugre thy dust and heraldry 

ha ravish 
when I be dead be it not so o my soul 
I feel it weep within i and the tear 
soften my flesh Lorenzo I repent my fury 

I advise you the best way my wisdom can direct 

I thank you for it

I be no soon sensible do the duke 
affect my sister still say you 

most passionate 

she shall obey he then upon my life 
that be it my life I know she love i dear 
I shall have much ado to win she to it 
but she shall come I will send she 

perform this 

I will only send she but prepare 
not to be disobedient to his highness 
he shall command she any thing 

do this 
and be for ever happy when these have 
only for form but wait on you home 
this disengage they 

my humble service 
to the duke I pray and tell he Amidea 
this night shall be at his dispose by this 

I be confident farewell attend Sciarrha 

pity the seaman that to avoid a shelf 
must strike upon a rock to save himself 

the door be fast 
enough be weep already for Pisano 
there be something else that must be think on and 
of great consequence I be yet unsafe 
that for thy sake be guilty of his blood 

though all my stock of tear be spend already 
upon Pisano loss and that my brain 
be bankrupt of moisture and deny 
to lend my grief one drop more for his funeral 
yet the remembrance that you have make 
a forfeit of your dear life 
be able to create a weep spring 
within my barren head o my lose brother 
thou have a cruel destiny my eye 
in pity of thy fate desire to drown thou 
the law will only seek thou upon land 
hide in my tear thou shall prevent the stroke 
kill both our name and thou 

I know thou love i 
poor girl I shall desire to cherish life 
if thou lament i thus so rich a comfort 
will tempt i wish I may delay my journey 
to heaven 

good heaven that we may go together 

that must not be 

then let i go before 

how 

make my suit unto the prince my blood 
may be your ransom let i die Sciarrha 
my life be fruitless unto all the world 
the duke in justice will not deny this 
and though I weep in tell thou I shall 
smile on the scaffold 

how my honour blush 
to hear thou Amidea in this love 
thou wound i more than thou desire to save 
suffer for i why thou be innocent 
I have provoke the punishment and dare 
obey it manly if thou can redeem i 
with any thing but death I think I shall 
consent to live but I will not have thou venture 
all at one chance 

nothing can be too precious 
to save a brother such a love brother 
as you have be 

death be a devour gamester 
and sweep up all what think thou of a eye 
can thou spare one and think the blemish recompense 
to see i safe with other or a hand 
this white hand that have so often 
with admiration tremble on the lute 
till we have pray thou leave the string awhile 
and lay our ear close to thy ivory finger 
suspect all the harmony proceed 
from their own motion without the need 
of any dull or passive instrument 
no Amidea shall not bear one scar 
to buy my life the sickle shall not touch 
a flower that grow so fair upon his stalk 
thy other hand will miss a white companion 
and wither on thy arm what then can I 
expect from thou to save i I will live 
and owe my life to thou so it be not buy 
too dear 

do you believe I shall not find 
the way to heaven be both my eye thy ransom 
I shall climb up those high and rugged cliff 
without a hand 

one way there be if thou 
do love with that tenderness 

pronounce it 
and let no danger that attend incline you 
to make a pause 

the duke thou know do love thou 

he 

nay do not start already nor mistake i 
I do not as before make trial of thou

Petruchio 

my lord 

thou be now my servant 

I ever be in heart your humble vassall 

thou be faithful I must cherish thy desert 
I short shall reward it very short 
next morning must salute i duke the sun 
and I must rise together 

I shall pray 
your glory may outshine he in your Florence 
and when he set we may enjoy your sunbeam 

it be handsome flattery and become a courtier 

i flatter not my lord 

then thou be a fool 
no music to a great man chime so sweet 
and man must thrive come hither how many 
have thou kill 

but one my lord 

but one 

and i must owe 
my life to your lordship I have be hang else 

but one wait at the door he be 
not fit to kill a duke who hand be guilty 
but of a single murder or at least 
not fit alone to act it i have be 
practise already and though no man see it 
nor scarce the eye of heaven yet every day 
I kill a prince appear thou tragic witness 
which though it bleed not I may boast a murder 
here first the duke be paint to the life 
but with this pencil to the death I love 
my brain for the invention and thus 
confirm dare trust my resolution 
I do suspect his youth and beauty may 
win some compassion when i come to kill he 
or the remembrance that he be my kinsman 
may thrill my blood or something in his title 
may give my hand repulse and startle nature 
but thus i have arm myself against all pity 
that when i come to strike my poniard may 
through all his charm as confident wound he 
as thus i stab his picture and stare on it 
methinks the duke shall feel i now be not 
his soul acquaint can he less than tremble 
when i lift up my arm to wound his counterfeit 
witch can persecute the life of who 
they hate when they torment their senseless figure 
and stick the waxen model full of pin 
can any stroke of i carry less spell 
to wound his heart send with as great a malice 
he smile he smile upon i i will dig 
thy wanton eye out and supply the dark 
and hollow cell with two pitch burn taper 
then place thou porter in some charnel house 
to light the coffin in
