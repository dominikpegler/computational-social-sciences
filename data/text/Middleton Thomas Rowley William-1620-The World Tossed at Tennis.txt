will take from our regard and we shall want 
the noble presence of our princely master 
in his so frequent visitation 
which we be wont so full to enjoy

Rather a cause of joy that we enjoy 
so fair a fellowship Denmark why she be 
a stately palace and majestical 
ever of courtly breed but of late 
build up unto a royal height of state 
round with noble prospect by her side 
the silverfooted Thamesis do slide

when we do serve let we be ready for it 
And call at his great pleasure the round year

and give we all employment seasonable 
I be for cold hour when the bleak air 
bite with a icy tooth when summer have sear 
and autumn all discolour lay all fallow 
pleasure take house and dwell within door 
then shall my tower smoke and comely show 
but when again the fresh morn appear 
and the soft spring renew her velvet head

more sweeterbreathing air more bound more pleasure 
the hound loud music to the fly stag 
the feather talenter to the fall bird 
the bowman twelvescore prick even at the door 
and to these I can add a hundred more 
then let not we strive which shall be his home 
but strive to give he welcome when he come

however your welcome be most bounteous 
which I beseech you take as gracious 
to you my owner master and my lord 
let i the second unto you afford 
and then from you to all for it be you 
that give indeed what I but seem to do 
I be from ruin raise by a fair hand 
a royal hand in that state let i stand 
for ever now to bounty I be breed 
my cup full brim and my free table spread 
to hundred daily even without my door 
I have a open hand unto the poor 
I know I shall so still then shall their prayer 
pass by the porter key climb up each stair 
and knit and joint my new reedify frame 
that I shall able be to keep your name 
unto eternity Denmark house shall keep 
her high name now till time do fall asleep 
and be no more mean time welcome welcome 
hearty welcome but chief you great sir 
whatever lie in my power command i all 
as free as you be at your whitehall 

soldier tarararara how be it thou look as if thou have lose a field today 

no but I have lose a day in the field if you take i a maund but where I be command let they show i the house of correction 

why thou be not maund be thou there be martial danger in that believe it 

no sir but I be bold to show myself to some of my old and familiar acquaintance but be disguise with my want there be nobody know i 

faith and that be the worst disguise a man can walk in thou be better have appear drink in good clothes much better there be no superfluity shame a man as to be overbrave overbold overswearing overlie overwhoring these add still to his repute it be the poor indigence the want the lank deficiency as when a man can be brave dare not be bold be afraid to swear want maintenance for a lie and money to give a whore a supper this be pauper cvius modicum non satis est nay he shall never be rich with beg neither which be another wonder because many beggar be rich 

o cavina facundia this dogeloquence of thou will make thou somewhat one day scholar can thou turn but this prose into rhyme there be a pitiful live to be pick out of it 

I can make ballad for a need 

very well sir and I will warrant thou thou shall never want subject to write of one hang himself today another drown himself tomorrow a sergeant stab next day here a Pettifogger of the pillory a bawd in the cart nose and a pander in the tail hic mulier haec vir fashion fiction felony foolery a hundred haven have the balladmonger to traffic at and new one still daily discover 

prithee soldier no further this way I participate more of Heraclitus than Democritus I can rather weep the sin of the people then sing they 

shall I set thou down a course to live 

faith a course live I think must serve my turn but why have thou not find out thy own yet 

tush that be resolve on beg when there be use for i 
I shall be brave again hug and belove 
we be like winter garment in the height 
and hot bloodof summer put off throw by 
for mothmeat never so much as think on 
till the drum strike up storm again and then 
come my welllined soldier with valour 
not valour keep i warm o I love thou 
we shall be trim and very well brush then 
if we be face with fur it be tolerable 
for we may pillage then and steal our prey 
and not be hang for it when the least finger 
in peaceful summer choke we a soldier 
at the best be even but the forlorn hope 
unto his country send desperate out 
and never more expect if he come 
peace war perhaps the law provident 
have provide for he some house or land 
may be suspense in wrangle controversy 
and he be hire to keep possession 
for there may be sword draw he may become 
the abject second to some stink bailie 
o let he serve the pox first and die a gentleman 
Come I know my end but will fain provide for thou 
can thou make 

what I have no handicraft man 

cuckold make cuckold it be a pretty trade 
in a peaceful city it be woman work man 
and they be good paymaster 

I dare not 
it be a work of supererogation and the church forbid it 

prithee what be latin for a cuckold scholar 
I can never learn yet 

faith the Latin have no proper word for it that ever I read homo I take it be the best 
because it be a common name to all man 

you be mad fellow you scholar I be persuade 
be I a scholar now I can not want 

every man be most capable of his own grief 
a scholar say you why there be none nowadays 
be you a scholar you will be a singular fellow 

how no scholar what be become of they all 

I will make it proof from your experience 
a commander a commander captain captain 
but have no soldier where be the command 
such be we all doctor no disciple now 
every man be his own teacher none learn of other 
you have not hear of our mechanic rabbi 
that shall dispute in their own tongue backward and forward 
with all the learned father of the jew 

mechanic rabbi what may those be 

I will show you sir and they be man be daily to be see 
there be rabbi job a venerable silkweaver 
jehu a throwster dwell in the hospital field 
there be rabbi Abimelech a learned cobbler 
rabbi Lazarus a superstitious tailor 
these shall hold up their shuttle needle awl 
against the grave Levite of the land 
and give no ground neither 

that I believe 
they have no ground for any thing they do 

you understand right and these man by practic 
have get the theory of all the art 
at their finger end and in that they will live 
however they will die I know not for they change daily 

this be strange 
how come they to attain this knowledge 

as boy learn arithmetic practise with counter 
to reckon sum of silver so with their tool 
they come to grammar logic rhetoric 
and all the science as for example 
the devout weaver sit within his loom 
and thus he make a learned syllogism 
his woof the major and his warp the minor 
his shuttle then the brain and firm conclusion 
make he a piece of stuff that Aristotle 
Ramus nor all the logician can take apieces 

This have some likelihood 

so likewise by 
his deep instructive and his mystic tool 
the tailor come to be rhetorical 
first on the spread velvet satin stuff or cloth 
he chalk out a circumferent paraphrase 
that go about the bush where the thief stand 
then come his shears in shape of a eclipsis 
and take away the tother too long tail 
by his needle he understand ironia 
that with one eye look two way at once 
metonymy ever at his finger end 
some call his piccadill synecdoche 
but I think rather that shall be his yard 
be but pars pro toto and by metaphor 
all know the cellarage under the shopboard 
he call his hell not that it be a place 
of spirit abode but that from that abyss 
be no recovery or redemption 
to any owner hand whatever fall 
I can run further be it not tedious 
and place the stifftoed cobbler in his form 
but let they mend themselves for yet all be nought 
they now learn only never to be teach 

let they alone how shall we learn to live 

without book be most perfect for with they 
we shall hardly thou may keep a fenceschool it be a noble science 

I have rather be in the crown office 
thou may keep school too and do good service 
to bring up child for the next age better 

it be a poor living that be pick out of boy buttock 

it be somewhat better than the nightfarmer yet 

ha there be somewhat more 
there be in sight a glorious presence 
a presence more than humane 

a amaze one scholar if ever thou can conjure speak now 

in name of all the deity what be thou 
thy shine be more than subcelestial 
it be at the least heavenly angelical 

a patroness unto you both you ignorant and undeserving favourite of my fame you be a soldier 

since these arm can wield Arm 
I have profess it bright deity 

to thou I be Bellona you be a scholar 

in that poor pilgrimage since I can go 
I hitherto have walk 

to thou I be Minerva 
Pallas to both goddess of art and arm 
of arm and art for neither have precedence 
for he be the complete man partake of both 
the soul of art join with the flesh of valour 
and he alone participate with i 
thou be no soldier unless a scholar 
nor thou a scholar unless a soldier 
you have noble breed both worthy foundation 
and will you build up rot battlement 
on such fair groundsel that will ruin all 
lay wisdom on thy valour on thy wisdom valour 
for these be mutual coincident 
what seek the soldier 

my maintenance 

lay by thy arm and take the city then 
there be the full cup and cap of maintenance 
and your grief be want too 

I want all but grief 

no you want most what most you do profess 
where read you to be rich be happy 
he have no bay from Phoebus nor from i 
that ever write so no Minerva in he 
my priest have teach that poverty be safe 
sweet and secure for nature give man nothing 
at his birth when life and earth be wed 
there be neither basin hold nor dowry give 
at part nor be any garner store 
wardrobe or warehouse keep for their return 
wherefore shall then man count his myriad 
of gold and silver idol since thrifty nature 
will nothing lend but she will have it again 
and life and labour for her interest 
my priest do teach seek thou thyself within 
make thy mind wealthy thy know conscience 
and those shall keep thou company from hence 
or will you wish to emulate the god 
live as you may imagine careless and free 
with joy and pleasure crown and those eternal 
this be to far exceed they for while earth last 
the deity themselves abate their fullness 
trouble with cry of never content man 
man then to seek and find it all that hope 
flee when Pandora fatal box fly open 

divine lady there be yet a competence 
which we come short off 

that may as well be cause 
from your own negligence as our slow blessing 
but I will prefer you to a great power 
even jupiter himself father and king of god 
with who I may well join in just complaint 
these latter age have despoil my fame 
Minerva altar be all ruine now 
I have along adore Palladium 
offering and incense fume on my shrine 
Rome hold i dear and old Troy give i worship 
all Greece renown i till the Ida prize 
join i with wrathful Juno to destroy they 
for we be better ruine then profane 
now let the latter age count the gain 
they get by wanton Venus sacrifice 
but I will invoke great jupiter 

do goddess 
and reerect the ruin of thy fame 
for poesy can do it 

Altitonant 
imperial crown and thunderarmed jove 
unfold thy fiery veil the flame robe 
and superficies of thy better brightness 
descend from thy orbicular chariot 
listen the plaint of thy poor votary 
it be Pallas call thy daughter jupiter 
take from thou by the lemnian Mulciber 
a midwife god to the delivery 
of thy most sacred fertile teem brain 

what will our daughter 

justjudging jove 
I meditate the suit of humble mortal 
by who large sceptre all their fate be sway 
adverse or auspicious 

it be more than jupiter 
can do to please they unsatisfy man 
have in his end no end not hell abyss 
be deep gulf then greedy avarice 
ambition find no mountain high enough 
for his aspire foot to stand upon 
one drink out all his blessing into surfeit 
another throw they out as all be his 
and the god bind for prodigal supply 
what be he live content in any kind 
that long incense nature be now ready 
to turn all back into the fruitless chaos 

these be two noble virtue my dread sire 
both art and arm wellwisher unto Pallas 

how can it be but they have both abuse 
and will for their ill make our justice guilty 
show they their shame Minerva what the young world 
in her unstable youth do then produce 
she shall grow grave now more sage more wise 
know concord and the harmony of goodness 
but if her old age strike with harsh note 
we may then think she be too old and dote 
strike by white art a theomantic power 
magic divine not the devil horror 
but the delicious music of the sphere 
the thrice three worthy summon back to life 
there let they see what art and arm commix 
for they have both do in the world broad face 
those that do propagate and beget their fame 
and for posterity leave last name 

I shall great jupiter 

these three be hebrew 
this noble duke be he at who command 
Hyperion rein his fiery courser in 
and fix stand over mount Gilboa 
this Mattathias son the Maccabee 
under who arm no less than worthy fall 
This the most sweet and sacred Psalmograph 
these of another sort of much less knowledge 
little less valour a macedonian bear 
who afterward the world can scarce bear 
for his great weight in conquest this Troy best soldier 
this Rome first Caesar these three of latter time 
and to the present more familiar 
great Charles of France and the brave Bulloine duke 
and this be Britain glory king thirteen time 
you have fair aspect more to express jove power 
show you have motion for a jovial hour 

be not these precedent for all future age 

but none attain their glory king of star 
these be the fame be follow and pursue 
but never overtake 

the fate below 
the god arm be not shorten nor do we shine 
with faint influence who conquer now 
make it his tyrant prize and not his honour 
abuse all the blessing of the god 
learning and art be theory no practic 
to understand be all they study too 
man strive to know too much too little do 

plaint be not we alone great jupiter 
see time himself come weep 

who have more cause 
who more wrong than time time pass all man 
with a regardless eye at best the worst 
expect he with a greedy appetite 
the land lord look for his quarter day 
the bigbellied usurer for his teem gold 
that bring he forth the child of interest 
he that beyond the bound of heaven large blessing 
have make a fruitless creature to increase 
dull earthen mineral to propagate 
these only do expect and entertain i 
but be come they bend their plod head 
and while they count their bag they let i pass 
yet instant wish i come about again 
will time deserve their thanks or jove their praise 
he must turn time only to quarter day 
o but my wrong they be innumerable 
the lawyer drive i off from term to term 
bid i and I do it bring forth my alathae 
my poor child truth he see and will not see she 
what I can manifest in one clear day 
he still delay a cloudy jubilee 
the prodigal waste and make i sick with surfeit 
the drunkard strong in wine trip up my heel 
and set i topsyturvy on my head 
wake my silent passage in the night 
with revel noise and thunderclapping oath 
and snort on my bright meridian 
and when they think I pass too slow by 
they have a newfound vapour to expel i 
they smoke i out ask they but why they do it 
and he that worst can speak yet this can say 
I take this whiff to drive the time away 
o but the worst of all woman do hate i 
I can set impression on their check 
with all my circular hour day month and year 
but it be wipe off with gloss and pencilry 
nothing so hateful as grey hair and time 
rather no hair at all it be sin autumn now 
for those fair tree that be more fair crop 
or they fall of themselves or will be lop 
even time itself to number all his grief 
will waste himself unto his end date 
how many will eternity wish here 
and that the sun and time and age may stand 
and leave their annual distinction 
that nature be bedrid all motion sleep 
time have then such foe have cause to weep 
redress it jupiter 

I tell thou glorious daughter and you thing 
shut up in wretchedness the world know once 
his age of happiness bless time own he 
till those two ugly ill deceit and pride 
make it a perish substance pride bring in 
forgetfulness of goodness merit virtue 
and place ridiculous officer in life 
vainglory fashion humour and such toy 
that shame to be produce 
the frenzy of apparel that be run mad 
and know not where to settle masculine paint 
and the five starch mock the five sense 
all in their different and ridiculous colour 
which for their apish and fantastic folly 
I summon to make odious and will fit they 
with flame of their own colour

in your forgetful duty jet before i 
take place of i you rude presumptuous gossip 
pray who be I not I the primitive starch

of high ShroveTuesday batter yellowhammer 
and you my tawny face that show like pride

and last thou red starch that wear all thy blush 
under thy cheek look like a strangle moon calf 
with all thy blood settle about thy neck 
the ensign of thy shame if thou have any 
know I be starch protestant thou starch Puritan 
with the blue nostril who tongue lie in thy nose 

wicked interpretation 

I have know a whitefaced hypocrite lady sanctity 
a yellow never come near she and she have be 
a citizen wife too starch like innocence 
but the devil prank not ugly in her mind 
wear yellow hug it if her husband trade 
can bear it there be the spite but since she can 
wear she own linen yellow yet she show 
her love to it and make he wear yellow hose 
I be as stiff in my opinion 
as any starch among you 

ay as you 

and I as any
