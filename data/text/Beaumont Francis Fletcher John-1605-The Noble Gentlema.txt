why do I leave my house and bring my wife 
to know the manner of this subtle place 
I will when first the lust to fame a honour 
possess i I have meet with any evil

that may maintain we in our daily work 
yet be they sound and sweet 

i Jaques there we dream not of our wife we lay together 
and need not now at length my cousin word 
so true mean mix with thy timely prayer 
so often urge to keep i at my home 
condemn i quite

his vine as fruitful as experience 
which be the art of husbandry can make 
he have his press for they and his wine

with plentiful provision yet his thrift 
can miss one beast among the herd 
he rule more where he live then ever you will here

persuade i to continue in this course 

why do you bring she hither at the first 
before you warm she blood with new delight 
our country sport can have content she 
when you first marry she a puppetplay 
please she as well as now the tilt do 
she think herself brave in a bugle chain 
where orient pearl will scarce content she now 

sure Jaques she see something for my good 
more than I do she oft will talk to i 
of office and that she short hope 
by her acquaintance with the friend she have 
to get a place shall many time outweigh 
our great expense and if this be so 

think better of her word she do deceive you 
and only for her vain and sensual end 
persuade you thus let i be set to dwell 
for ever naked in the bare soil 
so you will dwell from hence 

I see my folly 
pack up my stuff I will away this morn 
haste haste

treble upon you and the many prayer 
the country spend for he which almost now

but see where he come frown bless we all 

off with your hat for here do come 
the high and mighty duke of Burgundy 
whatever you may think I have think 
and think and think upon it and I find it plain 
the king can take back what he have give 
unless I forfeit it by course of law 
not all the water in the river see 
can wash the blood out of these princely vein 

God a mercy husband thou be the best 
to work out a thing at a pinch in France 

I will ascend my state again

and let loud music sound before his entrance 
sound trumpet 

how well our champion do demean himself 
as if he have be make for such a action 
methinks his sturdy truncheon he do wield 
like mar approach to a bloody field 

I think there be no man so desperate 
to dare encounter with our champion 
but trust i jaques thou have please we well 
once more our warlike music then proceed en Shat 

what wondrous age be this what close proceed 
I hear the clang of trumpet in this house 
to what intent do not our statesman search 
o no they look not into simple truth 
for I be true and they regard not i 
a man in armour too God save the king 
the world will end there be nought but treachery 

i Ja servant to the high and mighty Godfrey duke of Burgundy do come hither to prove by natural strength and activity of my body without the help of sorcery enchantment or negromancy that the say Godfrey late of mount Marine and now of Burgundy have perfect right thereto notwithstanding the king command to the contrary and no other person whatsoever and in token that I will be ready to make good the same I throw down my gage which be my honour pronounce the 37 of Feb stilo novo God save the D 

of all the plot the king have lay for i 
this be the shrewd it be my life they seek 
and they shall have it if I shall refuse 
to accept the challenge in the king behalf 
they have some cause to take away my life 
and if I do accept it who can tell 
but I may fall by doubtful chance of war 
it be shrewd but I must take the least of evil 
I take thy gauntlet up thou treacherous man 
that stand in arm coat against the king 
who God preserve and with my single sword 
will justify whatever he command 
I will watch he for catch of my word

what shall my title fall will thou not fight 

never with he that once have save my life 

dare thou not fight behold then I do go 
strong with the zeal I bear my sovereign 
and seize upon that haughty man himself 
descend the step that thou have thus usurp 
against the king and state down to the ground 
and if thou do utter but a syllable 
to cross the king intent thou be but dead 
there lie upon the earth and pine and die

to any danger that may end the doubt 

great duke and husband there be but one way 
to satisfy the world of our true right 
and it be dangerous

through France in triumph or to couple up 
the sophy and great prester john together 
I will attempt it duchess tell the course 

there be a strong opinion through the world 
and no doubt ground on experience 
that lion will not touch a lawful prince 
if you be confident then of your right 
among the lion bear your naked body 
and if you come off clear and never winch 
the world will say you be a perfect prince 

I thank you duchess for your kind advice

hark you sir the king do know you be a duke

that none know it but yourself

no live wight shall know I be a duke
