I love dinant my enemy nay admire he 
his valour claim it from i and with justice 
he that can fight thus in a cause not honest 
his sword edge with defence of right and honour 
will pierce as deep as lightning with that speed too

who only weakness be excess of courage 
that know no enemy that he can master 
but his affection and in they the worst 
his love to i 

to you
