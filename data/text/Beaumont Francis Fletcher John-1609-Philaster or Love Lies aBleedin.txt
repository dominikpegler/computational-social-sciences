why that which all the god have appoint out for i 

dear hide thyself bring in the prince 

hide i from Pharamont 
when thunder speak which be the voice of God 
though I do reverence yet I do not hide myself 
and shall a strange prince have leave to brag 
unto a foreign nation that he make Phylaster 
hide himself 

he can know it 

though it shall sleep for ever to the world 
it be a simple sin to hide myself which will for ever 
on my conscience lie 

then good Phylaster give he scope and way 
in what he say for he be apt to speak 
what you be loath to hear 

I will 

my princely mistress as true lover ought 
I come to kiss these fair hand and to show in outward ceremony 
the dear love within my heart 

if I shall have a answer or no direct I be go 

to what what will he have answer 

to his claim unto the kingdom 

sirrah I forbear you before the king 

good sir do so still I will not talk with you

and by the god 

peace Pharamont if then 

leave we Phylaster 

I have do 

you shall not need 

what now 

know Pharamont I loathe to brawl with such a blast as thou who be nothing but a valiant voice but if thou shall provoke i further man shall say thou be and not lament it 

do you sleight my greatness so much 
and in the chamber of the princess 

it be a place to which I must confess I owe a reverence but be the church at the high altar there be no place so safe where thou dar injury i but I dare kill thou and for your greatness know I can grasp you and your greatness thus thus into nothing give not a word not a word back farewell 

it be a odd fellow madam we must stop his mouth with some office when we be marry 

you be best make he your controller 

I think he will discharge it well 
madam I hope our heart be knit but yet so slow the ceremony of state be that it will be long before our heart be so then if you please be agree in heart let we not wait for dream form but take a little steal delight and so prevent our joy to come 

if you dare speak your thought I must withdraw in honour 

the constitution of my body will never hold out 
till the wedding I must seek else where 

and thou shall find her honourable boy full of regard 
unto thy tender youth for thy own modesty 
and for my sake apt to give than thou will be to ask 
I or deserve 

sir you do take i up when I be nothing 
and I be only yet some thing by be you 
you trust i unknown and that which you be apt to construe a simple innocence in i perhaps may have be crafty the cunning of a boy harden in lie and theft yet venture you to part my misery and i for which I never can expect to serve a lady that bear more honour in her breast than you 

but boy it will prefer thou thou be young 
and bear a childish overflow love to they that clap thy cheek and speak thou fair but when judgement come no rule those passion thou will remember best those careful friend that place thou in the noble way of life she be a princess I prefer thou to 

in that small time that I have see the world 
I never know a man hasty to part with a servant he think trusty I remember my father will prefer the boy he keep to great man than he but do it not till they be too saucy for himself 

why gentle boy I find no fault at all 
in thy behaviour 

sir if I have make a fault of ignorance 
instruct my youth I shall be willing if not apt to learn 
age and experience will adorn my mind with large 
knowledge and if I have do a wilful fault 
think i not past all hope for once 
what master hold so strict a hand over his boy 
that he will part with he without one warning 
let i be correct to break my stubbornness 
if it be so rather than turn i off 
and I shall mend 

thy love do plead so pretty to stay 
that trust i I can weep to part with thou 
alas I do not turn thou off thou know it be my business 
that do call thou hence and when thou be with she 
thou dwell with i think so and it be so and when time be full 
that thou have well discharge this heavy trust 
lay on so weak a one I will again with joy 
receive thou as I live I will nay weep 
not gentle boy it be more than time thou do attend the princess 

I be go but since I be to part with you my lord and none know whether I shall live to do more service for you take this little prayer heaven bless your love your sigh all your design may sick man if they have your wish be well and heaven hate those you curse though I be one 

the love of boy unto their lord be strange I have read wonder of it yet this boy for my sake if a man may judge by look and speech will out do story I must see a day to pay he for his loyalty

that all the doctor in the country will not cure he 
that boy be a strange find out antidote to cure her infection 
that boy that princess boy that chaste brave 
virtuous lady boy and a fair boy a wellspoken boy 
all these consider can make nothing else 
but there I leave you gentleman 

nay we will go wander with you 

and doubtless it be true 

I and it be the god 
that raise this punishment to scourge the king 
with his own issue be it not a shame for all we 
that write noble in the land for we that shall be freeman 
to behold a man that be the bravery of his age 
Phylaster press down from his royal right 
by this regardless king and only look and see the sceptre 
ready to be cast into the hand of that lascivious lady 
that live in lust with a smooth boy 
now to be marry to you strange thing 
who but that people please to let he be a prince 
be bear a slave in that which shall be his most noble part 
his mind 

that man that will not stir with you to aid Phylaster 
let the god forget that such a creature 
walk upon the earth 

the gentry do await it and the people 
against their nature be all for he and like a field if stand corn 
move with a stiff gale their head bow all one way 

the only cause that draw Phylaster back 
from this attempt be the fair princess love 
which he admire and we can now comfort 

perhaps he will not believe 

why gentleman it be without question so 

i it be past speech she live dishonest 
but how shall we if he be curious work 
on his belief 

we all be satisfy within ourselves 

since it be true and lord to his own good 
I will make this new report to be my knowledge 
I will say I know it I will swear I see it 

it will be best 

it will move he 

here he come good morrow to your honour 
we have spend some time in seek you 

my worthy friend you that can keep your memory to know your friend in misery and can frame on man disgrace for virtue a good day attend you all what service may I do worthy your acceptation 

my lord we come to urge that virtue which we know 
life in your breast forth rise make a head 
the noble and the people be all dull with this usurp king 
and not a man that ever hear the word 
know such a thing as virtue but will second your attempt 

how honourable be this love in you to i 
that have deserve more know my friend 
you that be bear to shame your poor Phylaster 
with too much courtesy I can afford to melt myself 
to thanks but my design be not yet ripe sufficient 
that ere long I shall employ your love 
but yet the time be short of what I will 

the time be full than you expect 
that which hereafter perhaps be reach by violence 
may now be catch as for the king you know 
the people long have hate he but now 
the princess who they love 

why what of she 

be loathe as much as he 

by what strange mean 

she be know a whore 

thou lie 

my lord 

thou lie and thou shall feel it I have think 
thy mind have be of honour than to rob a lady 
of her good name be a infectious sin not to be pardon 
be it false as hell it will never be redeem 
if it be sow among the people faithful to increase 
all evil they shall he be let i alone that I 
may cut out falsehood where it grow set hill on hill 
betwixt i and that man that utter this and I will scale they all 
and from the utmost top fall on his neck 
like thunder from a cloud

I do love fair truth she be my mistress and who injury her draw vengeance from i sir let go my arm 

nay good my lord be patient

but this my lord be truth 

o say not so

why she be take at it 

it be false by heaven it be false it can be 
can it speak gentleman can woman all be damn 

why then it can be 

and she be take with her boy

hell and sin know he sir you be deceive 
I will reason it a little mild with you 
if she be lustful will she take a boy that know not yet desire she will have one shall meet her thought and know the sin she act which be the great delight of wickedness you be abuse and so be she and I 

how you my lord 

why all the world abuse in a unjust report 

o noble sir your virtue can look 
into the subtle thought of woman in short my lord 
I take they I myself 

now all the devil thou do fly from my rage 
will thou have take devil engender plague 
when thou do take they hide thou from my eye 
will thou have take dagger in thy breast 
when thou do take they 
or be strike dumb for ever that this fault 
may have sleep in silence 

have you know he so ill temper 

never before 

the wind that be let loose from the four corner 
of the earth and spread themselves all over sea and land 
meet not a fair on what friend bear a sword 
to run i through 

why my lord be you so move at this 

when any fall from virtue I be distract 
I have interest in it 

but good my lord recall yourself 
and think what be best to be do 

I thank you I will do it

tomorrow I will find your lodging and give you answer 

all the god direct you the ready way 

I have forget to ask they where he take she 
I will follow he o that I have a sea within my breast 
to quench the fire I feel more circumstance 
will but flame this fire it more afflict i now 
to know by who the deed be do then simple 
that it be do and he that tell i this be honourable 
as far from lie as she be far from truth 
oh that like beast we can not grieve ourselves 
with that we see not bull and ram will fight 
to keep their female stand in their sight 
but take they from they and you take at once 
their spleen away and they will fall again 
unto their pasture grow fresh and fat 
and taste the water of the spring as sweet as it be before 
find no start in sleep but miserable man 
see see you god he walk still and the face you let he wear 
when he be innocent be still the same not blush 
be this justice do you mean to entrap mortality 
that you allow treason so smooth a brow 
I can now think he be guilty 

health to you my lord 
the princess do commend her love her life 
and this unto you 

o Bellario now I perceive she love i 
she do show it in love thou my boy 
she have make thou brave 

my lord she have attire i past wish 
past my desert more fit for her attendant 
but far unfit for i that do attend 

thou be grow courtly my boy 
o let all woman that love black deed learn to dissemble here 
here with this paper she do write to i 
as if her heart be twine of adamant 
to all the world beside but unto i a maiden snow 
that melt with my look tell i my boy 
how do the princess use thou 

scarce like her servant but as if I be 
something ally to she or have preserve her life 
three time by my fidelity as mother fond 
do use their only son as I will use one that be leave unto my trust 
for who my life shall pay 
if he meet harm so she do use i 

why it be wondrous well 
but what kind language do she feed thou with 

why she do tell i she will trust my youth with all her maiden store and do call i her pretty servant bid i weep no more for leave you she will see my service reward and such word of that soft strain that I be near weep when she end then ere she speak 

this be much better still 

be you not well my lord 

ill no Bellario 

methinks your word fall out from your tongue so uneven nor be there in your look that quickness that I be wont to see 

thou be deceive boy and she stroke thy head 

yes 

and she do clap thy cheek 

she do my lord 

and she do kiss thou boy ha 

how my lord 

she kiss thou 

never my lord by heaven 

that be strange I know she do 

no by my life 

why then she do not love i 
come she do I bid her do it I charge she by all charm of love between we by the hope of peace we shall enjoy to yield thou all delight naked as to her lord I take her oath thou shall enjoy she tell i gentle boy be she not paradise be not her breath sweet as arabian wind when fruit be ripe be not her breast two liquid ivory ball be she not all a last mine of joy 

yes now I see why my discurl thought be so perplex when first I go to her my heart hold augury you be abuse some villain have abuse you I do see where you tend fall rock upon his head that put this to you it be some subtle train to bring that noble friend of you to nought 

thou think I will be angry with thou come thou shall know all my drift I hate she more than I love happiness and place thou there to pry with sparrow eye into her deed have thou discover be she fall to lust as I will wish she speak some comfort to i 

my lord you do mistake the boy you send 
have she the lust of sparrow and of goat 
have she a sin that weigh from the world beyond the name of lust 
I will not aid her base desire 
but what I come to know as servant to she 
I will not reveal to make my life last age 

o my heart 
this be a salve worse than the main deceit 
tell i thy thought for I will know the least 
that dwell within thou or will rip thy heart 
to know it I will see thy thought as plain 
as I do now thy face 

why so you do she be for aught I know by all the god 
as chaste as ice but be she foul as hell 
and I do know it thus the breath of king 
the point of sword torture nor bull of brass 
shall wrack it from i 

then it be no time to dally with thou I will take thy life 
for I do hate thou I can curse thou now 

if you do hate i you can not curse i worse 
the god have not a punishment in store 
to i then be your hate 

fie fie so young and so dissemble tell i when and where 
thou do enjoy she or let plague fall upon i 
if I destroy thou not 

by heaven I never do and when I lie to save my life 
may I live long and loathe hew i asunder 
and while I can think I will love those piece you have cut away 
better than those that grow and kiss those limb 
because you make they so 

fear thou not death can boy contemn that 

oh what boy be he can be content to live 
to be a man that see the best of man thus passionate 
thus without reason 

o thou do not know what it be to die 

yes I do know my lord it be less than to be bear 
a last sleep a quiet rest from all jealousy 
a thing we all pursue I know beside it be but give over again 
that must be lose 

but there be pain false boy 
for perjure soul think but those and then thy heart will melt 
and than thou will utter all 

may they fall all upon i while I live 
if I be perjure or have ever think of that you charge i with 
if I be false send i to suffer in those punishment you speak of kill i 

oh what shall I do why who can but believe he 
he do swear so earnest that if it be not true the god will not endure he rise Bellario thy protestation be so deep and thou do look so true when thou utter they that though I know they false as be my hope I can urge thou further but thou be too blame to envy i for I must love thy honest look and take no revenge upon thy honest look a love from i to thou be firm whatever thou do it trouble i that I have call thy blood out of thy cheek that do so well become thou but good boy let i not see thou more something be do that will distract i that will make i mad if I behold thou if thou tender i let i not see thou 

I will fly as far 
as there be morning ere I give distaste to that most honour frame but through these tear shed at my hapless part I can see a world of treason practise upon you and she and i farewell for evermore if you shall hear that sorrow strike i dead and after find i loyal let there be a tear shed from you in my memory and I shall rest at peace 

blessing be with thou whatever thou deserve 
o where shall I go bathe this body nature too unkind 
that make no medicine to a trouble mind 

I marvel my boy come not back 
but that I know my love will question he over and over 
how I sleep make talk how I remember he 
when his dear name be last speak 
and how speak when I sigh song and ten thousand such 
I shall be angry at his stay 

what in your meditation who attend you

where may a maid live secure free 
keep her honour fair not with the live

and laugh upon it make it but a mirth 
and flow it by do I live now like he under this tyrant king 
that languish here his sad bell and see his mourner

under a woman falsehood oh that boy that curse boy 
none but a villain boy to ease your lust 

nay than I be betray 
I feel the plot cast for my overthrow 
oh I be wretched 

now you may take that little right I have to this 
poor kingdom give it to your joy for I have no joy in it 
some far place where never woman kind dare set her foot 
for burst with her poison must I seek 
and live to curse you and there dig a cave 
and preach to beast and bird what woman be 
how heaven be in your eye but in your heart more hell 
than hell have how your tongue like scorpion 
both heal and poison how your thought weave 
with thousand change in one subtle web and wear by you 
how that foolish man that read the story of a woman face 
and die believe it be lose for ever how all the good you have 
be but a shadow in the morning with you and at night behind you 
past and forget how your vow be frost fast for a night 
and with the next sun go how you be

that love can distinguish these sad text 
till my last hour I be bind to utter of you 
so farewell all my woe all my delight

be in thy cradle false send to make lie 
and to betray innocence thy lord and thou 
may glory in the ash of a maid fool by her passion 
but the conquest be nothing so great as wicked 
fly away let my command force thou to that 
which shame will do without it if thou understand 
the loathe office thou have undertake 
why thou will hide thou under heap of hill 
lest we shall dig and find thou 

o what god angry with i have send this strange disease 
into the noble mind madam this grief you add unto i 
be no more than drop to sea for which they be not see to swell 
my lord have strike his anger through my heart 
and let out all the hope of future joy

that he may know your worth while I go seek 
out some forget place to die

and call for you with earnestness 

I be in tune to hunt Diana if thou can 
rage with a maid as with a man let i discover thou 
bathe and turn i to a fearful hind 
that I may die pursue by cruel hound
