my brother Heron have right wise deliver his opinion for he that thread his needle with the sharp eye of industry shall in time go throughstitch with the new suit of preferment 

speak to the purpose my fine witted brother Sketon for as no indenture but have its counterpane no noverint but his condition or defeasance so no right but may have claim no claim but may have possession any act of parliament to the contrary notwithstanding 

you be all read in mystery of state 
and quick of apprehension deep in judgement 
active in resolution and it be pity
