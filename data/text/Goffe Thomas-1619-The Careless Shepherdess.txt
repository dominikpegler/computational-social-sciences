play on let music feed the ear which be they play it again 
deny my mistress voice that strain again

the magic of a siren note So so the music cease 
now let they sing what in my sleep I dream 
of Cupid cruelty

sometime to meet and talk and smile and kiss 
without desire of more possession

shall rest in this the wish of more betray 
but the rank part of love 

be every virgin 
of this opinion the race of man 
and woman will be lose have but your mother

and charm beauty now have make Lariscus

forsooth upon a beggar a base shepherdess 

o sir forbear the thunder when it break 
carry no more horror with it than this 
speech of you can she be base who nature 
have grace with all perfection of the first 
creation I tell you sir be all 
as she Pandora shall receive her ill 
into her box again and man as at 
the first shall be exempt from a fear 
of death 

alas poor silly boy thou think 
that virtue which be only varnish over 
with modest look 

such modest look as grace 
Arismena can be counterfeit she be 
no impostor her chaste look be the true 
symptom of what lie treasure in the heart 
to which I have vow devotion and will pay 
my love religious to her chaste self 

but ere you do it think on these age hair 
and tell i if their whiteness exact not 
your quick obedience to my will 

Indeed 
I must confess you be my father and 
may by that challenge sir to be the pilot 
of my will and in aught which may concern 
i but my wife you shall bear great sway 
than I myself 

I thank thou sir in thing 
of most importance I must be a stranger 
in slight and common thing you will use my counsel 

nay sir I do mean 
to beg here your consent with all humility 
become a son and I do nourish hope 
you will be kind and make my wish happy 
for I must here profess I love she so 
that be the world propound my reward 
to change that dear affection to this maid 
thus I will spurn it my soul fly to she 
with wing of chaste and zealous love 

you be then resolve 

I be 

to marry without a portion 

without such portion as the world esteem 
and yet she be not sir so poor she have 

what have she foolish boy a nest of sheephook 
her father goodly armoury a stock 
of tar and sear iron to grace your dine room 
where for variety instead of arm 
shall hang so many bottle and old pouch 
abroad his rot sheep will raise a sum 
to build and purchase town you will learn a trade too 
of lie in the sun and lose of 
your ragged wardrobe beside the art 
of whistle to the dog that bark again 
to help a consort these be precious thing 
and then the beauteous paragon your wife 
with her strawhat and linseywolsey robe 
a petticoat have serve she twelve may day 
beside the feast of jig about maypole 
be such a treasure 

if you consider sir how great a virtue 
lie hide under so mean a veil shall I 
despise a diamond because it come not in 
a golden casket all which the poet feign 
be extant in Astrea flee will seem 
but as one drop unto the sea if my 
sweet Arismena virtue be but weigh 

and this you praise so much shall be your sole 
patrimony 

sir your pleasure 

a goodly patrimony virtue will buy 
lordship and stock your ground maintain the offspring 
of your admire choice yes and at length 
leave something to your noble family 

much wealth consist sir in the enjoy 
a virtuous wife admit you give i to 
a woman with a golden mine who vast 
and unexhausted entrail can scarce 
be fathom yet she may be a strumpet sir 
and so defile your unadulterate race 
will bag heap with coin restore chaste blood 
into those sinful vein I know it will serve 
as pander to corrupt your noble stock 
o think on that and tell i if my choice 
deserve your scorn 

if you can find estate 
and riches to her comeliness and create 
a noble blood to fill her bright transparent vein 
I may consent 

the ground we walk in sir and what your eye 
in flowery mead may see abroad be she 
she have a thrive father unto who 
she be sole child these thing I grant hold no 
proportion to your estate and yet 
a less may bring content but where she come 
to crown all this what can be a addition 
to my felicity pray sir be not cruel 
but give consent 

thou mention only shadow 
and art in love with baseness leave this folly 
and think not of she 

bid i sir not live 
and it will be much easy to obey you 
but while I have my breath and use my reason 
I must be Arismena votary 

you must 

my heart be compel

So so I here cast off 
the relation of a father thou be no more

unmerciful think sir that once yourself 
do love and I have hear you tell a story

I banish thou my sight and what be i 
be absent from my thought and know I can 
leave off to be a father when my son 
shall cease his duty to my care 

you may 
have give i a gentle doom but since 
you banish i your presence I must go 
to be repair in Arismena smile 
and there entomb your frown yet let i beg 
your blessing first which shall while you deny i

beget a peaceful sleep in which they be bless 
from frigid fear all day at night with rest

Come shepherd come impale your brow 
with garland of the choice flower the time allow 
Come nymph deck in your dangle hair 
and unto Sylvia shady bower with haste repair 
where you shall see chaste turtle play 
and nightingale make last may 
as if old time his youthful mind 
to one delightful season have confine 

what music be this do reach our ear 
which sound like that make by the sphere 
and so affect the eager sense 
it be ravish with its excellence 

the air do smell of indian spice 
or that the sense stupefy 
which by arabian wind be spread 
from the ash of a phoenix dead 
whence be this wonder 

see see where 
the lovely goddess do appear 
fair Sylvia she that order how 
before Pan altar we shall bow 
and for propition every year 
of the choice fleece our sheep do bear 
pay thankful sacrifice that he 
may keep our flock from danger free 
instruct we goddess what be thy will 

upon this leafy woodcrowned hill 
I do invite you to Pan feast 
where each shall be a welcome guest 
then to the music of my voice 
move gentle on each with his choice 
but so that no malicious eye 
see aught to task your modesty 
for your delight must always be 
attend on by chastity 

it be time the sacrifice begin 
devotion must be do within 
which do you may of Ceres taste 
and Bacchus gift but make no waste 
for oft where plenty injure stand 
the bounteous god do shut their hand 
the snowy fleece you have shear 
and crop the golden ear of corn 
Lyaeus blood be press and put 
into the safe preserve butt 
there when the cold and bluster air 
invite you from the plain yet fair 
to take warm shelter that may keep 
yourselves in health and eke your sheep 
will into your numb limb inspire 
a active and preserve fire 
let your expression then be free 
and gentle move follow i 
on shepherd on we will sacrifice 
those spotless lamb we prize 
at high rate for pan do keep 
from harm our scatter sheep 
and have deserve 
for to be serve 
with those you do esteem the best 
among the flock as fit for his feast 
Come virgin bring your garland here 
and hang they everywhere 
then let his altar be overspread 
with rose fresh and red 
burn gum and spice 
rich sacrifice 
the god so bounteous be you know 
you mortal can pay they what you owe 

here be harmless mirth oh it be a happiness 
to be in such sweet company who will 
not forsake all the riches of the world 
for one he love do she but live as pure 
as be those soul contain in shepherd weed 
o love what man have power to resist 
thy pierce dart which like a fatal lightning 
hurt not the skin nor flesh yet wound the heart 
I that this morning be my father joy 
the sole hope of his age and fortune be 
become a stranger to his family 
by he exile and throw from all his care 
I scarce in this habit know myself 
yet I be happy in it and shall be happy 
if Arismena for who sake I suffer 
smile on the change she be here and with she 
her fair companion Castarina I will 
obscure myself and listen to their talk 

Indeed Arismena I must chide you for it 
because you be fair indeed the fair shepherdess 
in all Arcadia must that make you cruel 
that beauty will become you more if you 
will show you have a heart like other nymph 
or if you can love you need not scorn 
those that express their service 

thou be foolish 
I do they justice shall I smile upon 
their passion and pity they or but nourish 
their folly they will more afflict themselves 
and trouble i I give they soon their answer 
tell they what they shall trust to that they may not 
languish in expectation 

well you have a heart 

yes I feel it beat but it be not yet 
infect with that mischief you call love 
nor I hope shall but if virgin love 
themselves they will place a better guard about 
their bosom and preserve their innocent freedom 
and not let every flattery betray they 
give up their liberty for a song or sigh 
of any whine lover 

do you think 
that no man can deserve your love 

I never 
examine their desert that may endanger i 
they be all alike to i that court my favour 
now fie on love it ill befit 
or man or woman know it 
love be not mean for people in their wit 
and they that fond show it 
betray their too much feather brain 
and shall have only bedlam for their pain 
to love be to distract my sleep 
and wake to wear fetter 
to love be but to go to school to weep 
I will leave it for my better 
if single love be such a curse 
to marry be to make it ten time worse 

Come Arismena you in vain do hide 
yourself from i I see through your disguise 
it be pretty well dissemble but I know 
your heart be not so empty as you speak it 
I know you love 

who prithee 

nay he do 
preserve you too be you more fair and to 
that beauty have a soul above your sex 
you know Philaritus 

ha ha ha 

a gentleman 
heir to Cleobulus but his fortune be 
the least addition he be fame darling 
and one who service be a heaven to you 
be but a shepherdess 

but a shepherdess 
why Castarina I do value my 
be a shepherdess above all his hope 
and fortune nor shall change that honest title 
for all the honour of the court but because 
it seem thou have opinion that I love he 
I will clear my heart to thou and hold it truth 
what I affirm it be true Philaritus 
be a desertful gentleman and have make 
express sign of his dear affection to i 
but by Diana self he be to i 
in point of love no more than he that be 
the rude shepherd of the plain 

no more 
I do believe you and rejoice to hear it 
for in her heart poor Castarina love he 
though he know it not 

who be that have not 
some shepherd overhear we 

yes but one 
that shall take no delight to publish what 
concern his own misfortune 

be not this Philaritus 

turn shepherd for your sake 
how every garb do become he 

do not 
fly i sweet Arismena for I bring 
no danger to your person soon death 
with torture shall let fall his string upon 
my heart then once Philaritus shall bring 
a thought that shall displease fair Arismena 

what be your will sir for I now have but 
short time for stay and if your business be 
no other than you late propound to i 
you need not a repetition 
unless you take delight to hear i say 
I can love 

why then I can live 

yes many a fair day and enjoy a love 
of far more worth than Arismena be 
a foolish shepherdess 

he must not be 
a man and hold his life long that shall dare 
to speak that language 

well sir be this all 
the affair with i the minute call i hence 

poor Castarina in what plight be thou 
to see the treasure of thy heart slide from thou 
and pour itself into another bosom 
she be compose of tyranny I shall not 
be so hardhearted will Philaritus 
direct his passion hither o my fate 

Indeed Philaritus I can help 
all this I be not your father governor 
it be but your disobedience you may 
recover he again if you will take 
my counsel and throw off this foolish love 
your father be wise and I be of his mind 
partly you take a course to lose yourself 
and where you urge the penance you be willing 
to undergo for love of i I answer 
as you can resist what love compel you to 
I can help that I be not in love 
it be your fate to have too much and I 
too little love all this must be obey 

steel break his heart let i advise you sir 
be not too much deject this be but 
a short live humour I dare prophesy 
you may be happy in your affection 

make not my wound ridiculous I pray 
by flatter i with hope she be all marble 

Come Castarina stay be not that Gracculus 

I be glad I have you o mistress 

what be the matter 

feel here and here and indeed everywhere 

have thou meet with a satire thou be fright 

worse worse the devil will not have 
put i into this sweat 

prithee speak why be thou so distract 

he bleed too 

it will make you mad to be use as I have be but that be 
not all o mistress your father and my master 

ah what of he be he sick 

no no worse worse 

be he dead 

worse worse an he have be dead my head have not be break and my bone make powder in my skin with his sheephook 

what be the wonder 

speak the worst 

why then he be possess 

with a evil spirit 

yes the devil be in he I think he come home in such a fury and have beat we all round the poor whelp in the chimney corner for offer but to open his jaw be new wake out of his dream with his thunder and his brain beat out which the cat perceive run mad out of the top of the chimney the first word he say be Arismena Arismena and because you appear not the next thing be a blow this blood can witness I can scarce recover my tongue to tell he you be not within but after half a dozen more knock and kick one with another for I be not to choose bid i run in the devil name and fetch you and present or go hang myself imagine I be glad to be out of his reach and with as much haste as my bruise will allow I have seek you up and down now I have find you pray come home and know his meaning I dare not appear without you I must choose my tree else o my shoulder I think I be best hang myself present to be out of my pain 

it be very strange but Castarina come 
nay thou shall bear i company and help 
to calm his passion farewell Philaritus 

that word carry some comfort yet o may 
blessing reward thy tongue for it and yet it be 
if I remember but the common word 
at part farewell something it contain 
once but it be now grow empty and no wish 
of happiness be ever man thus lose 
in the labyrinth of love to court my mistress 
a flinty heart woman o my star 
you be ungentle to design i such 
a miserable fate to affect where I be 
scorn and have no power to withdraw 
my heart from ruin death be a easy change 
why I be in the way it must needs break 
my heart at last I must once die and it be 
better to die in love then otherwise 

when by the current of yon crystal stream 
I sit i down a gentle slumber close 
these weary eye and dream transform love 
make beauty seem imperfect in herself 
for then o then sad thought disturb my mind 
I sigh it forth that which in my know sense 
be heresy to think so pure I know 
be Castarina love that to misdoubt 
be breach of faith and yet such fancy do 
arise within my trouble brain I know 
not what to hope or doubt o fancy 
thou work too much upon my nature and I 
be too too credulous of dream yet pass 
thou ill suspicion of my love they shall 
disturb my rest which like to healthful blood 
shall run in all my vein and by my hope 
create a new establish peace which shall 
extinguish fearful thought as Lucifer 
exhale the gross vapour from the earth 
then till Apollo oracle propound 
more cause of fear I will hope the best soft music within this sweet 
harmony tell i I be near the sacred place 
which will resolve my doubt and see the temple 
door yield i a free access unto his throne 
yet I will forbear to speak till he have cease 
his music on his charm lyre 

we to thy harp Apollo sing 
while other to thy altar bring 
their humble prayer 
for length of day 
or else for knowledge of their fate 
which by their prayer thou renovate 
and do renew 
not as their due 
but as their worth incite thy love 
to shower thy blessing from above 

I be all wonder 
thou who do all secret know 
vouchsafe for to descend so low 
as to resolve a doubt which spring 
from dream and such sad nightly thing 
shall Castarina be my love 
speak Apollo and if she prove 
but kind unto my vow I swear 
I will offer incense every year 
and oft my grateful thank return 
and spice on thy altar burn 

thou shall find cross in thy love 
yet time may make they blessing prove 
for when the virgin over her hearse 
have place the garland and sad verse 
and bathe the cold earth with their tear 
thy hope shall overcome thy fear 
and till that she be dead shall not 
enjoy her love untie the knot 

be clear oracle and leave i not 
in doubt what be your gate already shut 
open but once again and speak although 
your voice be death let not my tremble soul 
be torture through despair or else be grieve 
by vain expect of my joy say great 
Apollo be she i not a word 
be thou grow deaf unto our prayer then here 
begin my misery and where I do 
expect the clear unfold of my doubt 
there I perceive a riddle I shall be 
cross in my love and yet from thence derive 
new blessing can effect spring from a cause 
have difference in the extreme when she be dead 
I shall enjoy her love with what delight 
can my flame meet her cold and useless earth 
or must I then form to my memory 
her live shape and with desire embrace 
that shadow which my fancy now command 
and when I please give i possession of 
the juggle God make pastime of my passion 
but why do I profane great power forgive i 
it be a just punishment for be curious 
to know the mystery of fate I must 
refer the event to what be order by 
the high disposer of my destiny 

come on my fellow satire we will be 
still master of the wood and please ourselves 
and our appetite no matter though 
the foolish shepherd rail upon we let we 
pursue our game no shepherdess shall escape 〈◊〉 
unless they wake with strong guard and when 
man come like army to destroy we we 
trust to our nimble foot and leave they curse 
because they have not wing to overtake we 

the nymph because we be deform contemn we 
but if we take they at advantage we 
teach they repentance and delight ourselves 
upon their rape the last I grapple with 
be a delicious thief 

pursue your pleasure 
only I charge you if in any walk 
of you the beautiful Arismena 
chance to appear none touch she to offence 
and lest your presence fright she haste away 
she must be i although I almost despair 
that so much sweetness shall affect a monster 
for I have against my nature court she 
lie prostrate at her foot with sigh and tear 
beseech she to compassionate a heart 
that languish for a kiss still she have scorn i 
next time I meet she at advantage I 
will satisfy my full desire upon she 

we will obey 

all other of her tribe 
be free to you but she must be my prey 
o I be ravish but with the thought 
how sweet a piece of flesh I shall compel 
to serve my pleasure not a thousand prayer 
nor river of her tear shall quench my lust 
methinks I have she at embrace already 
we live to please our sense and will not change 
our goatish shape with any soft humanity 
to court a female and be make their fool 
and die for love of any peevish giglet 

yet it be not much amiss to flatter they 
if so they may be win 

right but if they 
be obstinate indeed use violence 
and snatch your own delight from their fair bosom 
and glory in it when we have break their maidenhead 
they will serve a dote shepherd Come be frolic 
and leap into a dance to practise our 
activity the place be most secure 
lusty pipe I be all fire methinks

for she be take with Philaritus 

o cruel Castarina

only to Arismena she be here too 
a witness of his falsehood how do you 
affect their action Arismena

be not too much delight I imagine 
they be both false o for revenge I will do it 
why shall we be so tame Philaritus 
be perjure 

Castarina be too cruel 

be rule by i and punish they 

they observe we 

it shall but vex their eye let we seem love 

Lariscus and Arismena they embrace

disease to i pray have i 

how be this poor Castarina 

methinks all this may have a easy cure 
a little blood drain from the heart will do it 
and then I be revenge no I be then 
a great triumph to her pride no woman 
be worth our small part of life and man 
betray a cowardice for a wanton scorn 
to practise wound upon himself yet I 
must not be altogether tame and suffer 
there be a subject fit for my revenge 
Lariscus must not long enjoy his breath 
or I must sacrifice myself to death 

it be more than I expect for I mean 
to take revenge on thou Philaritus 
the injury do i by thy ambition and courtship of Arismena be no way to be pardon if thou have any spirit meet i at Apollo oak this afternoon where I will either punish thy insolence or with my own blood write myself 
have I not know the fair Castarina 
or thy accomplish virtue this have be 
a cause sufficient to inflame my blood 
but as thou be the subject of my thought 
this will increase my zealous flame and while 
Philaritus think Arismena steel 
my point it be thou add vigour to my arm 
fair Castarina write here and in 
each wound I make sweet Castarina shall 
be read yet stay cool thy strong passion heart 
let not fond love be blind use reason ere 
thou fight and weigh what in a woman can 
deserve a wound why Castarina fair 
and seem to have a soul above her sex 
that may inflame my heart o no she may 
but seem a glorious star and then in what 
a case be poor Lariscus in when he 
shall wound Philaritus and find his love 
beneath his thought it will be a corrosive 
beyond a cure and do already make 
i hinge like to a doubtful needle draw 
betwixt two lodestone which at once incline 
to both and neither yet vanish all such thought 
they be most false be then revenge Lariscus 
and meet the fury of thy enemy spear 
who flattery have destroy thy hope in fear 
now cruel Castarina if I die 
there be a end of lover misery 

I have discover his intention 
to court my beauty that he may appear 
in his neglect to Arismena more 
desire by she it be our general humour 
and I myself will now enjoy Lariscus 
because he now neglect i but my fear 
will not allow i to believe it possible 
let it be order then by providence 
and time what be here contain ah a challenge she take up the challenge 
send from Philaritus unto Lariscus 
o my star happy influence they have make i 
the mean for bless prevention of their ruin 
betwixt who their own dissemble have beget 
a mutual jealousy I must be sudden 
not dally with occasion it be our fate 
to increase our love by other seem hate 

this place will yield a echo to thy voice 
come therefore Graculus let we pass the time 
more pleasant you have a merry song I know 

truth mistress you know my song they be rude yet such as nature not art have teach i I will power into your ear 
I be in love and can woo 
heighho heighho what shall I do 
I gape and sigh and sometime weep 
for Phillis that my heart do keep 
I love her hair and forehead high 
then be I take with her eye 
her cheek I do commend for gay 
but then her nose hang in my way 
her lip I praise but then step in 
her white and pretty dimple chin 
but there her neck I do behold 
fit to be hang with chain of gold 
her breast be soft as any down 
beneath which lie her maiden town 
so strong and fortify within 
in vain I hope to take it in 

excellent sing Graculus

will force no amorous kiss if your pure soul

so high as to salute your hand and if 
with freedom you shall grant i that I will boast

dare not to touch 

see brightful star your voice have shrink i back 
and I lie prostrate at your foot nor from the earth 
will raise my tremble joint till that clear voice 
which strike i down shall raise i from the ground 
and by your genuine voice create my soul 
as pure from dregs of earth as you 

it be well 
this language argue more than what you seem 
and can almost entice i to believe 
I may shake off the fear which do arise 
from sight of your grim shape yet still those look 
those ravenous look affright my heart and I 
can be safe amid such deformity 

o stay let not this outward shape amaze 
your bright self the mind that be fair may well 
excuse what nature have misshape grant that 
she have bestow as comely part upon 
this outward form as ere Narcissus have 
yet if the mind have be misshape the man 
will like some curious piece of marble seem 
a glorious form and will the rich endowment 
of the inward man virtue and wit those part 
which make he different from a move statue 

rise from the moist bedew earth your tongue 
have win so much that I will admit your touch 
my hand 

which with devotion I will kiss

to give over when I be conquer by your speech 
but now I have taste those sweet which hang upon 
your lip you may expect the day and night 
as soon shall meet as I not kiss again

what though thou see i rude yet in this shape 
there be a soul can honour thou and I 
must now embrace thou as my joy 

defend

so bad or ill a deed the gentile breath 
which from the phoenix nest perfume 
the rosy morn be not more chaste than I 
the idolater adore not his idol 
with great reverence than I will you

thus passionate no mortal pay devotion 
with great zeal unto his private larr

you may repose your peaceful rest he which 
have venture thus will think no blood his own 
if it be keep from be spill when he 
may spend it in your service 

you have sir 
engage i beyond my desert and though 
Arismena be a woman and can repay 
nought but her thank yet those shall be so oft 
and just pay to you that all the world 
shall know my heart be not ungrateful 
for so great a favour 

you may be please 
Arismena to find a thing more grateful 
than formal thank if you will return your love 
it will make i happy and renew a life 
for trust i I do wonder how I live 
without your resignation of my heart 
which you have fair one and I can last 
unless you give it back 

I do resign it 
most willing I claim no title in it 

but yet you can for indeed my heart 
be bind with you and unless you bestow 
your own I must be void no heart can be 
encircle in this breast but you 

why you 
will not have i pluck out my heart to have it swallow 

you be please to jest you know my 
mean and if you will can add a joy 
to my sick soul 

you will have i render then 
love back for love why that I can do 

why Arismena why have I deserve 
so ill that you shall kill i for my faith 
and make another rich in your affection 

sure you be change and this be but pretence 
Castarina be your love and have you be 
lover of i as you will seem she have never 
be court by Philaritus 

how like the ivy have my heart desire 
to show by what embrace I will hold you 
I have no love thought on other beauty 
you be life and from your smile I gain 
my bliss 

if then your bliss consist in i 
I be sorry that my eye invite my heart 
to grant another suit for trust i sir 
I can wish in the requitance of this 
last favour that I can bestow my heart 
on you which since I dare not do I take 
my leave and wish you rest for your own sake 

stay yet and hear i a few word I know not 
how long I have to live and rather than 
be punish thus with your continual scorn 
I will put on wing to meet death but be sure 
my trouble spirit shall pursue thou live 
and represent my passion and not leave thou 
till thou by such a cruelty as thy own 
from he who thou affect best shall suffer 
as I have do and die to meet i in 
the gloomy shade of lover 

fare you well sir I will think on it 

why do not break thou foolish heart but thou 
may be art destine for Lariscus sword 
death will be happiness I will kiss that fate 
rather than live the object of her hate 

mischief pursue you both he wound i 
but not I hope to death though I seem so 
I will be revenge upon you both for this 
I fear I bleed too inward if I die 
my curse shall procure their tragedy 

how vain unbridle youth be that be over sway 
by giddy passion resolute hazard 
for satisfaction of their trivial rage 
their soul eternity Castarina 
have inform i that young Philaritus 
and Lariscus do intend to venture 
like prodigal gamester at one cast the stock 
of both their live and fortune prevention 
must be soon apply or their too much beat 
may prove their utter ruin and though Cleobulus 
count i the object of his scorn my care 
shall give he notice of their wild intent 
good day to you sir may I desire you will 
let your master know I will speak with wit he 

I shall 

perhaps Cleobulus who scrupulous soul 
be apt to make a question of my faith 
may judge this act a flattery a pretence 
of seem friendship that with more safety 
Philaritus may obtain his desire 
of Arismena than to hazard 
he to the danger of Lariscus spear 
but these be vain surmise my intent 
be plain and virtuous and good action ever 
however miscontrive carry their reward 
still with themselves 

will you with i 

yes 

speak your intent 

Philaritus 

shall not enjoy your daughter 

it be not my suit 

say be so sir I shall with far more patience hear you 

brief thus 
I be inform and it be a serious truth 
your son Philaritus who noble soul 
can endure a rival in his love 
have send a challenge to Lariscus 
oh sir think what deserve pity it will excite 
in every honest bosom that two such plant 
shall be cut off from earth ere their full growth 
as by a violent tempest so or one 
or both be like to perish for this morn 
they be resolve to try their skill at arm 

which you will have i to prevent 

it be your part 

ah ah ah 
you be mistake then for well I find 
your aim and see you do contrive this plot 
to win i to consent Philaritus 
shall marry Arismena but you be too 
too young to cheat a fox and therefore 
ought to take more subtle way than this 
why you contemn my son but now and if 
that rage spring from the heart you will be glad 
he shall receive the danger you pretend 

my rage be ground here and know right sir 
I can neither will I now repent 
what then my passion utter I have more 
of man within i yet see here be the challenge 
send from Castarina which I will keep 
though eminent mischief follow I will little think 
this discovery of your son danger will 
have merit this entertainment 
so your best fate protect you 

may be 
that Bracheus be noble in his thought 
and true do intend the good of young 
Philaritus why shall he else affirm 
he have the the challenge and mean nothing else 
but friendship with Cleobulus I be 
too hasty in my speech and therefore will 
send for he back within there tell Bracheus 
I will speak with he 

I shall sir 

if now 
I see the challenge I shall soon perceive 
whether it be Philaritus his hand 
or no and then I soon shall find his plot 

do you send for i

acknowledge that I be too rash for to 
suspect your goodness ere I have a cause 
sufficient for my ground and therefore will 

have i produce the reason which occasion 
my former speech to you 

it be my ambition 

nay since you urge my anger you shall know 
I slight as much your fury as your love 
nor shall you by entreaty win i to 
prevent the mention danger he who can 
be so unjust as to misdoubt my truth 
shall perish in his ignorance before 
a syllable I utter shall deliver 
he from his sudden ruin 

I pray be so resolute 
I shall be diligent unto your speech 
and weigh each word that issue from your tongue 
and study how to show myself your friend

of fire by steel enforce out of a flint

most prejudicial nay dangerous 
even to your life the charm shall not delay 
your expectation long do you know 
the satyr when you see they once again 

the same the very same

as ere give parent hope 

these wish sir 
add to my great content and be 
but Arismena here there be not in 
the world that which can make Philaritus 
accurse 

it be my wonder that she stay 
thus long 

what noise be that 

some be strangle sure 

Hear it be plain now 

let we in I pray 

all be well I hope 

we hear a noise but can 
not tell where it be 

within oh oh oh 

hark 

it be hereabouts 

o horror 

unbind the man 

I be afraid 

what sport be this 

no sport the satyr 

what of they 

have intelligence I know not by what mean of your disguise of yourselves into their shape have surprise the house and ere we be aware bind and gag we as you see so instead of we bring in Arismena and Castarina who since have carry they away leave we in this lamentable case 

plague pursue they 

horror attend they 

fury 
rise in my brain and help i to revenge 

Fix i for ever here o you that send 
the active lightning from your throne or trust 
i with your thunder once dare you not 
or have I more consume flame within 
yes my breath may blast they all stand off run up and down 
fury swell up my breast and in this rage 
I can unmake the world and turn it back 
into its first unpolished heap and shall 
perform some worthy deed worthy Philaritus 

this do distract my son 

we will counsel he 
till we have set he right 

I be lose in grief 
and small be the hope I have to find relief 

here may we rest and ease 
our tire limb while some refresh gale 
court our sad fear into a sweet repose 
sit down 

I will do what you command yet I 
be fearful here be more danger than we see 

your too too nice fate guide to fate yield we 
for pensive care can it alter their decree 

this be her wont place on these green bank 
she sit she down when first I hear she play 
unto her listen sheep nor can she be 
far from the spring she be leave behind that rose 
I see not yesterday nor do that pink 
then court my eye she must be here or else 
that graceful marigold will sure have close 
its beauty in her wither leaf and that 
violet too will hang its velvet head 
to mourn the absence of her eye and see the satyr spy they asleep 
where she do lie purge the moisten air 
with she more gentle breath methinks she chide 
i in her sleep and fright my blood to paleness 
as I stand but come I be resolve 
nor can I long now forbear to force 
Arismena to come with i while I 
leave Castarina to her destiny 

sleep Castarina while thy sense 
do lose its use from fancy take 
instruction of that excellence 
they will keep thou safe when thou be awake 
nice honour be so rich a thing 
that to preserve it rather die 
or kill the ravisher will fling 
such stain upon thy modesty 
it be fair and just revenge for they 
who bosom lodge such foul intent 
it be fit shall die and daily pay 
their debt to the sin in punishment 

stay gentle spirit and with those sweet sound 
strike on my wake sense that I may be 
confirm it be no illusion I will obey 
the counsel of my genius sure it be it 
that guard i will it will appear again 
and teach thou Arismena ha she be go 
and whither how my ignorance and wonder 
a whirlwind in its giddy motion carry 
light matter not more swift then she be vanish 
have danger fright she or be she force 
by some rude satire thou that do instruct 
my soul so late guide i to the knowledge 
of her much doubt fate or show the way 
she be flee that I may follow Arismena 
let i overtake thou a ravenous bear 
or wolf have seize thou I will share thy harm 
and both die fold in each other arm 

Come fair one cast off your tremble fear 
no violence shall force your love I will rather choose 
to pierce this breast then let one accent fall 
that may offend your ear 

you do offend 
in speak thus 

I shall displease you more 
to snatch my pleasure from your breast 

you will 
indeed and do already fright my blood 
to paleness in my cheek 

o say not thus I do 
confess I have not in the stock of my 
desert enough to force one bounteous smile 
for to create i new but let not that 
cause you to frown or with one angry look 
turn i to ash as I stand 

still you 
do gild the pill you will have i take but I 
assure you sir my heart be none of i 
though the bright marriage God have yet forbear 
to light his taper we breathe both from one soul 

Come come you do but jest to egg i more 
by your delay 

you will find I speak the truth 
and covet more to die a martyr for 
this cause then live to be a empress 

be you so resolute so stout go in 
visit the room I lead you through look on 
those sting you be to feel unless you do 
consent and then consider that if they 
enforce you not you shall be quick send 
to those bless field you vain hope to view 

that death be welcome which shall render i 
a chaste example unto posterity 

these arcadian nymph be pattern to the world 
of chastity have my breath be spend on 
lady of the western court they will have prove 
more gentle than to let one thus long sue 
without a close embrace while these fly from 
the name fear the sound may get 
a act of lust 
here come another too 
who bright soul shall not by i be force 
fair maid 

bless i you power

judge not thus ill the respect 
I will show to you shall merit better thought

believe there be civility among wolf 
or that a lion can be bring to couch 
before his prey stand off or you shall feel I dare snatch a poniard from the satyr side and wound he 
be more than woman sluice your blood and laugh 
to see your soul expire 

stay gentle nymph 
this little blood have check my dare soul 

but do thou bleed o stop the murmur stream 
lest my feeble nature sink at the sight she drop the poniard and the satyr take it up 
of blood 

be thou so quick change be that 
great spirit which thou proud boast turn to 
effeminacy Come kiss i or I will 
draw so much of thy own it will fright thou more 
to view it stream from thy vein

tyrant can invent 

I will try your valour 
and get you yonder till I have frame a death 
more horrid than ere fancy think on yet 

let fall your sting they shall be welcome too 
I will kiss the hand which shall dismiss a maid 
and praise thy act in the elysian shade 

nothing can alter she but as the star 
keep still her constant course yet something I 
will do I it shall so and if 
this fail I will try some other plot 
the news 

the shepherd be ensnare

a good success or as I be I may 
either revenge or lengthen out my day 

unbind we slave

I be resolve nor though I can will grieve 

the spy be bring

muster enough to guard these wood while we 
afflict our punishment on these

Come hither you that be the master of 
these wood and think it nothing to destroy 
whole troop of satyr what will you bestow 
on we to set you free will you give up 
your virgin to our use and let we take 
the beauty of your land 

destruction first 

nay you shall enjoy they too only we 

will crack their maidenhead 

and we shall then 

be marry to they 

right 

and leave our land to those 
you get 

yes 

a halter first 

Say so tear limb 
from off the tree give they a welcome 

strange music 

the screechowl dirge ere death 

their note be change 

and now they sound as when the die swan 
fill the echo wood with harmony 

what shall become of poor Philaritus 

we will die encircle in each other arm 

fetch in the youth and let they sing the song 
they have prepare 

what now 

our sentence

I ask your pardon sir and will 
be glad to know what can deserve your smile 

jest not foul soul it be a death to live 
the object of your view we can as brave 
suffer as you torment and be those here 
which you have ravish from their love we will 
but shed some funeral tear upon their hearse 
and glad meet our death 

they be dead indeed 
and since you know their fate you shall be bring 
unto their tomb I will drop as many tear as you 
to show my penitence although it be 
a thing averse for i to weep yet when 
I think what goodness I have destroy I must 
accuse my lust and then lament your loss 

accurse slave 

nay dry your tear for if 
there be such grove and joyful field as you 
call fortunate your nymph be sport in 
their shade triumph over our cruelty 

they die unspotted then 

they do and breathe 
out soul as pure as air before it mix 
with earth 

bless virgin lead forward to their tomb 
I long to pay a funeral tear and weep 
till I be become the only Niobe 

they be enclose in these in they be hide 
more riches than the world have leave but I 
sin in their praise my tear shall expiate 
my crime 

which be my Arismena tomb 

This 

I will bedew this chest while you Lariscus 
weep your grief over that 

o Castarina 
Send from the elysian field thy ghost to call 
i hence let not my airy soul be pen 
within this lump of clay and I be absent 
from that rich place thy pure part do bless 

my eye grow dry this breast have so much grief I can vent my tear 

I can supply what you do lack methinks I can embalm both corpse in i or else 
create a sea with river from my eye 

my sorrow flow 
so fast I want expression for my grief 

rise from the earth your tear can it raise they from 
their silent urn 

but yet they may perchance 
hasten my journey soon than I dream 

rather than so we will rise and live again 

alive 

yes and have I hope make you amends 
for all the injury I have do it be true 
I oft have think to woe Arismena 
to consent to marry i but I find 
she ever constant to Philaritus 
beside this shape have fright she which thus 
I now cast off 

Paromet 

your father Castarina

the plot but have not leave to crown you soon 
with the happy news or else I shall ere this 
have bless you from your fear 
and beg a pardon for the wound I give you

your doom be reverse 

I have practise all that be do 
with this intent that if I can procure 
Arismena as my love I hope I shall 
the easy entreat you to sue for my 
return which I do find you have obtain 
and do exact my service ever and bind 
i to entreat your pardon Arismena 

I can forgive and have you wrong i more

give i up chaste unto Philaritus 

do we not dream

never to be disjoin 

and once again take Castarina from her father hand 

welcome again dear heart 
to my own bosom 
and now the truth of the dark oracle 
be clear illustrate thou be dead 
dead to my hope and now I do enjoy thou 
after thy restitution to new life 
whence thy Lariscus do derive his own 
thy faithful true Lariscus 

I believe it 
though you suspect i 

Allow that error 
a reconciliation and free pardon 
henceforth I will be guard with such care 
a jealousy shall not assault one thought 
without repulse 

what noise be that 

no more plot I hope 

no no

keep close 

o prithee free he all be friend 

he be here and I will obscure myself 

o the horrid place and torture I have both see and feel be you their master do any of you desire to see hell before you go thither 

the fellow be mad and think there be no other place but that 

if you do come but with i and I will show a place such a place as go beyond the fire spit mountain and have worse torture in it by half than the gnaw vulture Ixion wheel or whatsoever else the lie poet do imagine o master have you but some little grudge of what I have endure you will I that you will run mad wild nay almost try the certainty of eternity rather than have your bone thus unjointed in your skin 

ah ah ah you be right serve for betray your mistress

shall be more glorious for the eclipse 
thus memphian balm that be of rich worth 
once bruise do send most precious odour forth
