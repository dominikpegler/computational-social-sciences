look you so strange my heart to see our limb 
thus suit in a hunter livery 
o it be a lovely habit when green youth 
like to the flowery blossom of the spring 
conform his outward habit to his mind 
look how yond oneeyed wagoner of heaven 
have by his horse fiery wing hoof 
burst open the melancholy jail of night 
and with his gild beam cunning alchemy 
turn all these cloud to gold who with the wind 
upon their misty shoulder bring in day 
then sally not this morning with foul look 
but teach your jocund spirit to ply the chase 
for hunt be a sport for emperor 

we know it be and therefore do not throw 
on these your pastime a contract brow 
how swift youth bias run to catch delight 
to i be not unknown no brother Gualther 
when you be woo by we to choose a wife 
this day you vow to wed but now I see 
your promise turn all to mockery 

this day yourself appoint to give answer 
to all those neighbourprince who in love 
offer their daughter sister and ally 
in marriage to your hand yet for all this 
the hour be come that call you to your choice 
you stand prepare for sport and start aside 
to hunt poor deer when you shall seek a bride 

nay come Mario your opinion too 
he have need of ten man wit that go to woe 

first satisfy these prince who expect 
your gracious answer to their embassy 
then may you free revel now you fly 
both from your own vow and their amity 

how much your judgment err who get a wife 
must like a huntsman beat untrodden path 
to gain the fly presence of his love 
look how the yelp beagle spend their mouth 
so lover do their sigh and as the dear 
outstrip the active hound and oft turn back 
to note the angry visage of her foe 
who greedy to possess so sweet a prey 
never give over till he cease on she 
so fare it with coy dame who great with scorn 
show the carepined heart that sue to they 
yet on that feign slight love conquer they 
they cast a eye of long back again 
as who will say be not dismay with frown 
for though our tongue speak no our heart sound 
or if not so before they will miss their lover 
their sweet breath shall perfume the amorous air yea 
and brave they still to run in beauty chase 
then can you blame i to be hunter like 
when I must get a wife but be content 
so you will engage your faith by oath to we 
your will shall answer my my like you 
and that no wrinkle on your cheek shall ride 
this day the marquess vow to choose a bride 

Even by my honour 

brother be advise 
the importunity of you and these 
thrust my free thought into the yoke of love 
to groan under the load of marriage 
since then you throw this burden on my youth 
swear to i whosoever my fancy choose 
of what descent beauty or birth she be 
her you shall like and love as you love i 

now by my birth I swear wed who you please 
and I will embrace she with a brother arm 

Mario and myself to your fair choice 
shall yield all duty and true reverence 

your protestation please i jolly 
let we ring a hunter peal and in the ear 
of our swift forest citizen proclaim 
defiance to their lightness our sport do 
the venison that we kill shall feast our bride 
if she prove bad I will cast all blame on you 
but if sweet peace succeed this amorous strife 
I will say my wit be best to choose a wife exeunt

so we do to a earthly heaven we turn it 

nay but dear julia tell we why so much you hate to enter into the list of this same combat matrimony 

you may well call that a combat for indeed marriage be nothing else but a battle of love a friendly fight a kind of favourable terrible war but you err Onophrio in think I hate it I deal by marriage as some Indian do the sun adore it and reverence it but dare not stare on it for fear I be stark blind you three be bachelor and be sick of this maidenhead count all thing bitter which the physic of a single life minister unto you you imagine if you can make the arm of fair lady the sphere of your heart good heart than you be in heaven o but bachelor take heed you be no soon in that heaven but you straight slip into hell 

as long as I have a beautiful lady to torment i I care not 

nor I the sweetness of her look shall make i relish any punishment 

except the punishment of the horn Urcenze put that in 

nay he be best put that by lord lord see what unthrift this love make we if he once but get into our mouth he labour to turn our tongue to clapper and to ring all in at Cupid church when we be better to bite off our tongue so we may thrust he out Cupid be swear enemy to time and he that lose time I can tell you lose a friend 

i a bald friend 

therefore my good servant if you wear my livery cast of this loose upper coat of love be ashamed to wait upon a boy a wag a blind boy a wanton my brother the duke want our company it be idleness and love make you captain to this solitariness follow i and love not and I will teach you how to find liberty 

we obey to follow you but not to love you no renounce that obedience exeunt
