for more than question pray sir what be you 

this sure be marrowboneparke and he the keeper 
a gentleman that come not to offend you 
I spoil no game you see I be unfurnish 
of instrument for such a wanton mischief 

but sir without a better satisfaction 
I must suspect you still mere recreation 
to walk for health seldom invite young gallant 
to leave their bed so early I must have more 

must saucy groom can any patience 
construe it manner your rude compulsion shall not 
enforce i to express so weak a spirit 
while I have hand and this 

at that guard sir 
then this must countercheck it either tell i

I shall not spare you else 

how happy now 
may this occasion make i be she lose 
beyond that hope which whisper she yet safety 
I must preserve myself yet if thou triumph 
in my submission because I have rather lose 
a little outward credit to prevent 
Worse mischief know I can devise revenge 
shall be a fair example for b●se difference 
from the pretence of any borrow power 
to overdo it be duty my name be Worthgood 

enough that word have power to check the force 
of any passion though the hot rage 
enslame it to be active 

here be a change 
why sure my name be a spell how it have calm 
the tempest of his fury 

what black star 
be find the ascendant in my crooked birth 
that all my life sad accident shall be 
such pregnant ill beget one another 
one sudden rashness in a moment may 
perhaps have mine he my duty honour 
make this hand a mover to his death 
who life I ought to cherish 

what will else 

nothing but pardon sir or if you please 
the occasion bring you hither lose you no company 

it can sure be fear that make i jealous 
I dare the worst of fate be he a actor 
in my pursuit I will venture all at once 
I have lose a gentlewoman and doubt her safety 
if any chance have guide you to find she 
do not delay my satisfaction 

I joy that chance make i the instrument 
of such a good please you to follow i 
I will guide you to this pensive one that grieve 
more your fear loss then her own misery 
she name you oft when by her fit transport 
recover from a swoon she think herself 
surprise by some that mean her injury 

shall I give faith my resolution be mad 
yet it shall try the event despair may bring 
a good success to a indifferent thing exeunt 

fie Frank there be such a disproportion 
it will never be bring to a equality 

why George do think the exterior good of fortune 
or titular greatness that derive itself 
from large spring and slow to swell the blood 
with attribute of gentle or of noble 
can make the difference such that the free soul 
must have the limit of her large desire 
prescribe by they nature impartial 
and in her work of man prefer not name 
of ancestor she sometime form a piece 
for admiration from the base earth 
that hold a soul and to a beggar issue 
give those perfection make a beauty up 
when pure mould polish and gloss with title 
honour and wealth bestow upon their blood 
deform impression object only fit 
for sport or pity 

yet never can the mixture 
of gold with clay make any transformation 
of that base matter into pure metal 

the chemistry of love can sure do it 
wedlock confer all honour that be a husband 
upon his wife 

and therefore you will marry 
a milk wench one that be drudge unto necessity 
it will be a credit to that long continuance 
of noble match which your ancestor 
have link to the chain of their own blood 
to make the series of their family 
spread in so many glorious division 
Come let my counsel guide these passive fire 
to flame aright and send their pyramid 
more upward let the gross stuff that feed they 
by a inversion choke they from advice 
man must choose wife not passion 

she be fair 
upon her person all the grace wait 
and dance in ring about she her bright eye 
be love chief mansion where he keep his court 
envy not fair one if my fancy do 
give all your dues to she save only those 
which your defect supply from wanton art 
her white and red she borrow not from any 
cosmetic drug nor puzzle the invention 
of learned practitioner for oil of talxe 
to blanch a Ethiope skin lily and rose 
be figure fit common beauty she 
want a comparison but its proper self 

you swell her praise too high so mean a subject fit not these rapture 

she be a subject George 
for large volume than invention 
yet ever fill with flatter hyperbole 
the very thought of she have strain my heartstring 
up to a pitch of joy who music make 
my spleen dance lusty measure 

if she be 
so rare a piece her low condition 
make i suspicious she be some common wanton 
lurk in that mask for safety 

do not friendship 
restrain it I shall be angry nay more punish 
so great a sin against her innocence 
I have lay all the bait that may entice 
apt inclination to sweet wickedness 
but can not catch she that way she have shun they 
with witty scorn and such imperious check 
have make i blush at my intention soulenesse 
which now be clear with noble resolution 
to give my hot desire their satisfaction 
in fair embrace such as the reverence 
of lawful wedlock sweeten 

virtuous policy 
Kill reputation that you may preserve 
a little better conscience any judgement 
will make a fair construction of my life 
that surfeit in delight and play the epicure 
in all variety and choice of pleasure 
soon then of thy act where ill do want 
a fair excuse as thou do they be double 

when thou have see she thou will soon acknowledge 
in what a misty error thy invective 
have lose themselves 

nay rather hide she from i 
she may raise motion and if I shall rival thou 
I must be serve nothing be ere devise 
to fright libidinous nature from it be proneness 
that can restrain i 

shall not make i jealous 
her soul be guard with so many virtue 
temptation can better it and in the way 
of noble love though yet she never sing 
the music of consent I dare prefer 
myself the first accept 

still be confident 

some city love couple 

what be that gallant 

Surely it be will Changelove 
the Proteus of affection one that vary 
as many shape of love as there be object 
but what that shething be I do not know
