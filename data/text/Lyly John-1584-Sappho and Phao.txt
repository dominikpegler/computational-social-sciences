thou be a ferryman Phao yet a free man possess for riches content and for honour quiet thy thought be no high than thy fortune nor thy desire great than thy calling who climb stand on glass and fall on thorn thy heart thirst be satisfy with thy hand thrift and thy gentle labour in the day turn to sweet slumber in the night as much do it delight thou to rule thy oar in a calm stream as it do Sappho to sway the sceptre in her brave court envy never cast her eye low ambition point always upward and revenge bark only at star thou fare delicate if thou have a fare to buy any thing thy angle be ready when thy oar be idle and as sweet be the fish which thou get in the river as the fowl which other buy in the market thou need not fear poison in thy glass nor treason in thy guard the wind be thy great enemy who might be withstand with policy o sweet life seldom find under a golden covert often under a thatch cottage but here come one I will withdraw myself aside it may be a passenger 

it be no less unseemly than unwholesome for Venus who be most honour in prince court to sojourn with Vulcan in a smith forge where bellows blow in steed of sigh dark smoke rise for sweet perfume and for the pant of love heart be only hear the beat of steel hammer unhappy Venus that carry fire in thy own breast thou shall dwell with fire in his forge what do Vulcan all day but endeavour to be as crabbed in manner as he be crooked in body drive nail when he shall give kiss and hammer hard armour when he shall sing sweet amour it come by lot not love that I be link with he he give thou bolt Cupid instead of arrow fear belike jealous fool that he be that if he shall give thou a arrow head he shall make himself a broad head but come we will to Syracuse where thy deity shall be show and my disdain I will yoke the neck that yet never bow at which if jove repine jove shall repent Sappho shall know be she never so fair that there be a Venus which can conquer be she never so fortunate 

if jove espy Sappho he will devise some new shape to entertain she 

strike thou Sappho let jove devise what shape he can 

mother they say she have her thought in a string that she conquer affection and send love up and down upon errand I be afraid she will yerk i if I hit she 

peevish boy can mortal creature resist that which the immortal god can redress 

the god be amorous and therefore willing to be pierce 

and she amiable and therefore must be pierce 

I dare not 

draw thy arrow to the head else I will make thou repent it at the heart Come away and behold the ferry boy ready to conduct we pretty youth de you keep the ferry that bend to Syracuse 

the ferry fair lady that bend to Syracuse 

I fear if the water shall begin to swell thou will want cunning to guide 

these water be common as the passenger be and therefore carry one so fair in show there be no cause to fear a rough sea 

to pass the time in thy boat can thou devise any pastime 

if the wind be with i I can angle or tell tale if against i it will be pleasure for you to see i take pain 

I like not fish yet be I bear of the sea 

but he may bless fish that catch such a one in the sea 

it be not with a angle my boy but with a net 

So be it say that Vulcan catch Mars with Venus 

do thou hear so it be some tale 

yea madam and that in the boat I do mean to make my tale 

it be not for a ferry man to talk of the god love but to tell how thy father can dig and thy mother spin but come let we away 

I be ready to wait 

Pandion since your come from the university to the court from Athens to Syracuse how do you feel yourself alter either in humour or opinion 

alter Trachinus I say no more and shame that any shall know so much 

here you see as great virtue far great bravery the action of that which you contemplate Sappho fair by nature by birth royal learned by education by government politic rich by peace insomuch as it be hard to judge whether she be more beautiful or wise virtuous or fortunate beside do you not look on fair lady in steed of good letter and behold fair face instead of fine phrase in university virtue and vice be but shadow in colour white and black in court show to life good and bad there time past be read of in old book time present set down by new devise time to come conjecture at by aim by prophesy or chance here be time in perfection nor by devise as fable but in execution as truth believe i Pandion in Athens you have but tomb we in court the body you the picture of Venus and the wise goddess we the person and the virtue what have a scholar find out by study that a courtier have not find out by practice simple be you that think to see more at the candle snuff than the sun beam to sail further in a little brook then in the main ocean to make a great harvest by glean then reap How say you Pandion be not all this true 

Trachinus what will you more all true 

cease then to lead thy life in a study pin with a few board and endeavour to be a courtier to live in emboss ruff 

a labour intolerable for Pandion 

why 

because it be hard to shape a life to dissemble than to go forward with the liberty of truth 

why do you think in court any use to dissemble 

do you know in court any that mean to live 

you have no reason for it but a old report 

report have not always a blister on her tongue 

ay but this be the court of Sappho nature miracle which resemble the tree Salurus who root be fasten upon knot steel and in who top bud leaf of pure gold 

yet have Salurus blast and water bough worm and caterpillar 

the virtue of the tree be not the cause but the easterly wind which be think common to bring canker and rottenness 

nor the excellency of Sappho the occasion but the iniquity of flatterer who always whisper in prince ear suspicion and sourness 

why than you conclude with i that Sappho for virtue have no copartner 

yea and with the judgement of the world that she be without comparison 

we will thither straight 

I will I may return straight 

why there you may live still 

but not still 

how like you the lady be they not pass fair 

my eye drink neither the colour of wine nor woman 

yet be I sure that in judgement you be not so severe but that you can be content to allow of beauty by day or by night 

when I behold beauty before the sun his beam dim beauty when by candle beauty obscure torch light so as no time I can judge because at any time I can discern be in the sun a brightness to shadow beauty and in beauty a glister to extinguish light 

scholarlike say you flatter that which you seem to mislike and to disgrace that which you most wonder at but let we away 

I follow and you sir boy go to Syracuse about by land where you shall meet my stuff pay for the carriage and convey it to my lodging 

I think all your stuff be bundle of paper but now must you learn to turn your library to a war drop and see whether your rapier hang better by your side than the pen do in your ear 

Molus what odds between thy commons in Athens and the diet in court a page life and a scholar 

this difference there of a little I have somewhat here of a great deal nothing there do I wear pantofle on my leg here do I bear they in my hand 

thou may be skill in thy logic but not in thy lerypoope belike no meat can down with you unless you have a knife to cut it but come among we and you shall see we once in a morning have a mouse at a bay 

a mouse unproper speak 

apt understand a mouse of beef 

I think indeed a piece of beef as big as a mouse serve a great company of such cat but what else 

for other sport a square die in a page pocket be as decent as a square cap on a graduate head 

you courtier be mad fellow we silly soul be only plodder at ergo who wit be clasp up with our book and so full of learning be we at home that we scarce know good manner when we come abroad cunning in nothing but in make small thing great by figure pull on with the sweat of our study a great shoe upon a little foot burn out one candle in seek for another raw worldling in matter of substance pass wrangler about shadow 

then be it time lose to be a scholar we page be politian for look what we hear our master talk of you determine of where we suspect we undermine and where we mislike for some particular grudge there we pick quarrel for a general grief nothing among we but in steed of good morrow what news we fall from cog at dice to cog with state and so forward be mean man in those matter that they will be cock to tread down other before they be chicken to rise themselves youth be very forward to stroke their chin though they have no beard and to lie as loud as he that have live long 

these be the golden day 

then be they very dark day for I can see no gold 

you be gross witted master courtier 

and you master scholar slender witted 

I mean time which be prophesy golden for plenty of all thing sharpness of wit excellency in knowledge policy in government for 

soft scholaris I deny your argument 

why it be no argument 

then I deny it because it be no argument but let we go and follow our master 

be it not strange that Phao on the sudden shall be so fair 

it can be strange sith Venus be dispose to make he fair that cunning have be better bestow on woman which will have deserve thanks of nature 

happy she do in spite of woman or scorn of nature 

proud else how squeamish he be be come already use both disdainful look and imperious word insomuch that he gall with ingratitude and then lady you know how it cut a woman to become a wooer 

tush child and fool the fair they be the soon they yield a apple will catch the one a baby the other 

your lover I think be a fair fool for you love nothing but fruit and puppet 

I laugh at that you all call love and judge it only a word call love methinks like a courtesy a smile a beck and such like be the very quintessence of love 

ay Mileta but be you as wise as you will be think fair or as fair as you think yourself wise you will be as ready to please man as you be coy to prank yourself and as careful to be account amorous as you be willing to be think discrete 

no no man be good soul poor soul who never inquire but with their eye love to father the cradle though they but mother the child give i their gift not their virtue a grain of their gold weigh down a pound of their wit a dram of give i be heavy than a ounce of hear i believe i lady give be a pretty thing 

I can but oftentimes smile to myself to hear man call we weak vessel when they prove themselves break heart we frail when their thought can hang together study with word to flatter and with bribe to allure when we common wish their tongue in their purse they speak so simple and their offer in their belly they do it so peevish 

it be good sport to see they want matter for then fall they to good manner have nothing in their mouth but sweet mistress wear our hand out with courtly kiss when their wit fail in courtly discourse now ruffle their hair now set their ruff then gaze with their eye then sigh with a privy wring by the hand think we like to be woo by sign and ceremony 

yet we when we swear with our mouth we be not in love than we sigh from the heart and pine in love 

we be mad wench if man mark our word for when I say I will none care for love more than I what mean I but I will none love but I where we cry away do we not present say go to and when man strive for kiss we exclaim let we alone as though we will fall to that ourselves 

nay than Canope it be time to go and behold Phao 

where 

in your head Ismena nowhere else but let we keep on our way 

wise 

Phao thy mean fortune cause thou to use a oar and thy sudden beauty a glass by the one be see thy need in the other thy pride o Venus in think thou have bless i thou have curse i add to a poor estate a proud heart and to a disdain man a disdain mind thou do not flatter thyself Phao thou be fair fair I fear i fair be a word too foul for a face so pass fair but what avail beauty have thou all thing thou will wish thou may die tomorrow and do thou want all thing thou desire thou shall live till thou die tush Phao there be grow more pride in thy mind than favour in thy face blush foolish boy to think on thy own thought cease complaint and crave counsel and lo behold Sibylla in the mouth of her cave I will salute she lady I fear i I be out of my way and so benight withal that I be compel to ask your direction 

fair youth if you will be advise by i you shall for this time seek none other inn than my cave for that it be no less perilous to travail by night then uncomfortable 

your courtesy offer have prevent what my necessity be to entreat 

Come near take a stool and sit down now for that these winter night be long and that child delight in nothing more than to hear old wife tale we will beguile the time with some story and though you behold wrinkle and furrow in my tawny face yet may you happy find wisdom and counsel in my white hair 

lady nothing can content i better than a tale neither be there any thing more necessary for i then counsel 

be you bear so fair by nature 

no make so fair by Venus 

for what cause 

I fear i for some curse 

why do you love and can obtain 

no I may obtain but can love 

take heed of that my child 

I can choose good madam 

then harken to my tale which I hope shall be as a straight thread to lead you out of those crooked conceit and place you in the plain path of love 

I attend 

when I be young as you now be I speak it without boast I be as beautiful for Phoebus in his godhead seek to get my maiden head but I fond wench receive a benefit from above begin to wax squeamish beneath not unlike to Asolis which be make green by heavenly drop shrink into the ground when there fall shower or the syrian mud which be make white chalk by the sun never cease roll till it lie in the shadow he to sweet prayer add great promise I either desirous to make trial of his power or willing to prolong my own life catch up my handful of sand consent to his suit if I may live as many year as there be grain Phoebus for what can god do and what for love will they not do grant my petition and then I sigh and blush to tell the rest I recall my promise 

be not the god angry to see you unkind 

angry my boy which be the cause that I be unfortunate 

what revenge for such rigor use the god 

None but suffer we to live and know we be no god 

I pray tell on 

I will have receive long life by Phoebus and rare beauty by nature I think all the year will have be may that fresh colour will always continue that time and fortune can not wear out what god and nature have wrought up not once imagine that white and red shall return to black and yellow the juniper the long it grow the crooked it wax or that in a face without blemish there shall come wrinkle without number I do as you do go with my glass ravish with the pride of my own beauty and you shall do as I do loath to see a glass disdain deformity there be none that hear of my fault but shun my favour insomuch as I stoop for age before I taste of youth sure to be long live uncertain to be belove gentleman that use to sigh from their heart for my sweet love begin to point with their finger at my wither face and laugh to see the eye out of which fire seem to sparkle to be sucker be old with spectacle This cause i to withdraw myself to a solitary cave where I must lead six hundred year in no less pensiveness of crabbed age than grief of remember youth only this comfort that be cease to be fair I study to be wise wish to be think a grave matron since I can return to be a young maid 

be it not possible to die before you become so old 

no more possible than to return as you be to be so young 

can not you settle your fancy upon any or will not destiny suffer it 

woman willing ascribe that to fortune which witting be commit by frowardness 

what will you have i do 

take heed you do not as I do make not too much of fade beauty which be fair in the cradle and foul in the grave resemble Polyon who leaf be white in the morning and blue before night or Anyta which be a sweet flower at the rise of the sun become a weed if it be not pluck before the set fair face have no fruit if they have no witness when you shall behold over this tender flesh a tough skin your eye which be wont to glance on other face to be sink so hollow that you can scarce look out of your own head and when all your tooth shall wag as fast as your tongue then will you repent the time which you can recall and be enforce to bear what most you blame lose not the pleasant time of your youth than the which there be nothing swift nothing sweet beauty be a slippery good which decrease while it be increase resemble the meddler which in the moment of his full ripeness be know to be in a rottenness while you look in the glass it wax old with time if on the sun parch with heat if on the wind blast with cold a great care to keep it a short space to enjoy it a sudden time to lose it be not coy when you be court fortune wing be make of time feather which stay not while one may measure they be affable and courteous in youth that you may be honour in age rose that lose their colour keep their savour and pluck from the stalk be put to the still cotonea because it bow when the sun rise be sweet when it be old and child which in their tender year sow courtesy shall in their decline state reap pity be not proud of beauty paint who colour consume themselves because they be beauty paint 

I be drive by your counsel into diverse conceit neither know how to stand or where to fall but to yield to love be the only thing I hate 

I commit you to fortune who be like to play such prank with you as your tender year can scarce bear nor your green wit understand but repair unto i often and if I can remove the effect yet I will manifest the cause 

I go ready to return for advice before I be resolve to adventure 

yet harken two word thou shall get friendship by dissemble love by hatred unless thou perish thou shall perish in dig for a stone thou shall reach a star thou shall be hate most because thou be love most thy death shall be fear and wish so much for prophecy which nothing can prevent and this for counsel which thou may follow keep not company with ant that have wing nor talk with any near the hill of a mole where thou smell the sweetness of serpent breath beware thou touch no part of the body be not merry among those that put buglosse in their wine and sugar in thou if any talk of the eclipse of the sun say thou never see it nourish no coney in thy vault nor swallow in thy eaves sow next thy vine mandrake and ever keep thy ear open and thy mouth shut thy eye upward and thy finger down so shall thou do better than otherwise though never so well as I wish 

Alas madam your pprophecy threaten misery and your counsel warn impossibility 

farewell I can answer no more 

unhappy Phao but soft what gallant troop be this what gentlewoman in this 

Sappho a lady here in Sicily 

what fair boy be that 

Phao the ferry man of Syracuse 

I never see one more brave be all lady of such majesty 

no this be she that all wonder at and worship 

I have seldom see a sweet face be all ferry man of that fairness 

no madam this be he that Venus determine among man to make the fair 

see I be only come forth to take the air I will cross the ferry and so the field then go in through the park I think the walk will be pleasant 

you will much delight in the flatter green which now begin to be in his glory 

sir boy will you undertake to carry we over the water be you dumb can you not speak 

madam I crave pardon I be spurblind I can scarce see 

it be pity in so good a face there shall be a evil eye 

I will in my face there be never a eye 

thou can never be rich in a trade of life of all the base 

yet content madam which be a kind of life of all the best 

will thou forsake the ferry and follow the court as a page 

as it please fortune madam to who I be a apprentice 

Come let we go 

will you go Pandion 

yea 

Criticus come in good time I shall not be alone what news Criticus 

I teach you that lesson to ask what news and this be the news to morrow there shall be a desperate fray between two make at all weapon from the brown bill to the bodkin 

now thou talk of fray I pray thou what be that whereof they talk so common in court valour the stab the pistol for the which every man that dare be so much honour 

o Molus beware of valour he that can look big and wear his dagger pommel lower than the point that lie at a good ward and can hit a button with a thrust and will into the field man to man for a bout or two he Molus be a shrewd fellow and shall be well follow 

what be the end 

danger or death 

if it be but death that bring all this commendation I account he as valiant that be kill with a surfeit as with a sword 

how so 

if I venture upon a full stomach to eat a rasher on the coal a carbonado drink a carouse swallow all thing that may procure sickness or death be not I as valiant to die so in a house as the other in a field methinks that epicure be as desperate as soldier and cook provide as good weapon as cutler 

o valiant knight 

I will die for it what great valour 

scholar fight who rather seek to choke their stomach then see their blood 

I will stand upon this point if it be valour to dare die he be valiant howsoever he die 

well of this hereafter but here come Calipho we will have some sport 

my mistress I think have get a gadfly never at home and yet none can tell where abroad my master be a wise man when he match with such a woman when she come in we must put out the fire because of the smoke hang up our hammer because of the noise and do no work but watch what she want she be fair but by my troth I doubt of her honesty I must seek she that I fear Mars have find 

who do thou seek 

I have find those I seek not 

I hope you have find those which be honest 

it may be but I seek no such 

Criticus you shall see i by learning to prove Calipho to be the devil 

let we see but I pray thou prove it better than thou do thyself to be valiant 

Calipho I will prove thou to be the devil 

then will I swear thou to be a God 

the devil be black 

what care I 

thou be black 

what care you 

therefore thou be the devil 

I deny that 

it be the conclusion thou must not deny it 

in spite of all conclusion I will deny it 

Molus the smith hold you hard 

thou see he have no reason 

try he again 

I will reason with thou now from a place 

I mean to answer you in no other place 

like master like man 

it may be 

but thy master have horn 

and so may thou 

therefore thou have horn and ergo a devil 

be they all devil have horn 

all man that have horn be 

then be there more devil on earth than in hell 

but what do thou answer 

I deny that 

what 

whatsoever it be that shall prove i a devil but hear thou scholar I be a plain fellow and can fashion nothing but with the hammer what will thou say if I prove thou a smith 

then will I say thou be a scholar 

prove it Calipho and I will give thou a good colaphum 

I will prove it or else 

or else what 

or else I will not prove it thou be a smith therefore thou be a smith the conclusion you say must not be deny and therefore it be true thou be a smith 

ay but I deny your antecedent 

ay but you shall not have I not touch he Criticus 

you have both do learned for as sure as he be a smith thou be a devil 

and then he a devil because a smith for that it be his reason to make i a devil be a smith 

there be no reason with these mechanical dolt who wit be in their hand not in their head 

be not choleric you be wise but let we take up this matter with a song 

I be content my voice be as good as my reason 

than shall we have sweet music but come I will not break of

Well say Eugenua you know yourself 

yea Canope and that I be one of your sex 

I have hear of a herb call lunary that be bind to the pulse of the sick cause nothing but dream of wedding and dance 

I think Ismena that herb be at thy pulse now for thou be ever talk of match and merriment 

it be a unlucky sign in the chamber of the sick to talk of marriage for my mother say it foreshow death 

it be very evil to Canope to sit at the bed foot and foretell danger therefore remove your stool and sit by i 

sure it be some cold she have take 

if one be burn I think we woman will say he die of a cold 

it may be some conceit 

then be there no fear for yet do I never hear of a woman that die of a conceit 

I mistrust she not for that the owl have not shriek at the window or the night raven crooked both be fatal 

you be all superstitious for these be but fancy of dote age who by chance observe it in some have set it down as a religion for all 

Favilla thou be but a girl I will not have a weasel cry nor desire to see a glass nor a old wife come into my chamber for then though I linger in my disease I shall never escape it

ah impatient disease of love and goddess of love thrice unpitiful the eagle be never strike with thunder nor the olive with lightning and may great lady be plague with love o Venus have I not straw thy altar with sweet rose keep thy swan in clear river feed thy sparrow with ripe corn and harbour thy dove in fair house thy tortoise have I nourish under my fig tree my chamber have I ceil with thy cockleshell and dip thy spung into the fresh water do thou nurse i in my swaddle clout with wholesome herb that I may perish in my flout year by fancy I perceive but too late I perceive and yet not too late because at last that strain be catch aswell by stoop too low as reach too high that eye be blear as soon with vapour that come from the earth as with beam that proceed from the sun love lodge sometime in cave and thou Phoebus that in the pride of thy hair shine all day in our horizon at night dip thy head in the ocean resist it Sappho while it be yet tender of acorn come oak of drop flood of spark flame of atom element but alas it fare with i as with wasp who feed on serpent make their sting more venomous for glut myself on the face of Phao I have make my desire more desperate into the nest of a halcyon no bird can enter but the halcyon and into the heart of so great a lady can any creep but a great lord there be a herb not unlike unto my love which the further it grow from the sea the salt it be and my desire the more they swerve from reason the more seem they reasonable when Phao come what then will thou open thy love yea no Sappho but stare in his face till thy eye dazzle and thy spirit faint die before his face than this shall be write on thy tomb that though thy love be great than wisdom can endure yet thy honour be such as love can not violate Mileta 

I come 

it will not be I can take no rest which way soever I turn 

a strange malady 

Mileta if thou will a martyrdom but give i my lute and I will see if in song I can beguile my own eye 

here madam 

have you send for Phao

I will either your cunning Phao or your fortune may by simples provoke my lady to some slumber 

my simples be in operation as my simplicity be which if they do little good assure they can do no harm 

be I sick the very sight of thy fair face will drive i into a sound sleep 

indeed gentlewoman be so drowsy in their desire that they can scarce hold up their eye for love 

I mean the delight of beauty will so blind my sense as I shall be quick rock into a deep rest 

you woman have a excuse for a advantage which must be allow because only to you woman it be allot 

Phao thou be pass fair and able to draw a chaste eye not only to glance but to gaze on thou thy young year thy quick wit thy stay desire be of force to control those which shall command 

lady I forget to commend you first and jest I shall have overslip to praise you at all you have bring in my beauty which be simple that in courtesy I may remember you which be singular 

you mistake of purpose or misconstrue of malice 

I be as far from malice as you from love and to mistake of purpose be to mislike of peevishness 

as far as I from love why think you i so dull I can love or so spiteful I will not 

neither lady but how shall man imagine woman can love when in their mouth there be nothing rife than in faith I do not love 

why will you have woman love in their tong 

yea else do I think there be none in their heart 

why 

because there be never any thing in the bottom of a woman heart that come not to her tongue end 

you be too young to cheapen love 

yet old enough to talk with market folk 

well let we in 

Phao be come 

who Phao Phao let he come near but who send for he

yet Medea make the everwaking dragon to snort when she poor soul can not wink 

Medea be in love and nothing can cause her rest but jason 

indeed I know no herb to make lover sleep but heart ease which because it grow so high I can reach for 

for who 

for such as love 

it grow very low and I can never stoop to it that 

that what 

that I may gather it but why do you sight so Phao

So pass fair oh fair Phao oh sweet Phao what will thou do for Venus 

anything that come in the compass of my poor fortune 

Cupid shall teach thou to shoot and I will instruct thou to dissemble 

I will learn any thing but dissemble 

why my boy 

because then I must learn to be a woman 

thou hear that of a man 

Men speak truth 

but truth be a she and so always paint 

I think a paint truth 

well farewell for this time for I must visit Sappho 

Sappho I have hear thy complaint and pity thy agony 

o Venus my care be only know to thou and by thou only come the cause Cupid why do thou wound i so deep 

my mother bid i draw my arrow to the head 

Venus why do thou prove so hateful 

Cupid take a wrong shaft 

o Cupid too unkind to make i so kind that almost I transgress the modesty of my kind 

I be blind and can not see my arrow 

How come it to pass thou do hit my heart 

that come by the nature of the head which be king once let out of the bow can find none other light place but the heart 

be not dismay Phao shall yield 

if he yield then shall I shame to embrace one so mean if not die because I can embrace one so mean thus do I find no mean 

well I will work for thou farewell 

farewell sweet Venus and thou Cupid which be sweet in thy sharpness 

Cupid what haste thou do put thy arrow in Phao eye and wound thy mother heart 

you give he a face to allure then why shall not I give he eye to pierce 

o Venus un happy Venus who in bestow a benefit upon a man haste bring a bane unto a goddess what perplexity do thou feel o fair Phao and therefore make fair to breed in i a frenzy o will that when I give thou golden lock to curl thy head I have shackle thou with iron lock on thy foot and when I nurse thou Sappho with lettuce will it have turn to hemlock have I bring a smooth skin over thy face to make a rough scar in my heart and give thou a fresh colour like the damask rise to make my pale like the stain Turkey o Cupid thy flame with Psyche be but spark and my desire with Adonis but dream in respect of these unacquainted torment laugh Juno Venus be in love but Juno shall not see with who lest she be in love Venus belike be become stale Sappho forsooth because she have many virtue therefore she must have all the favour Venus wax old and then she be a pretty wench when Juno be a young wife now crow foot be on her eye and the black ox have tread on her foot but be Sappho never so virtuous do she think to contend with Venus to be as amorous yield Phao but yield to i Phao I entreat where I may command command thou where thou shall entreat in this case Cupid what be thy counsel Venus must both play the lover and the dissembler and therefore the dissembler because the lover 

you will ever be play with arrow like child with knife and then when you bleed you cry go to Vulcan entreat by prayer threaten with blow woo with kiss ban with curse try all mean to rid these extremity 

to what end 

that he may make i new arrow for nothing can root out the desire of Phao but a new shaft of inconstancy nor any thing turn Sappho but a new arrow of disdain and then they dislike one the other who shall enjoy Phao but Venus 

I will follow thy counsel for Venus though she be in her latter age for year yet be she in her nonage for affection when Venus cease to love let love cease to rule but come let we to Vulcan 

what dream be these Mileta and can there be no truth in dream yea dream have their truth methinks I see a stock dove or woodquist I know not how to term it that bring short straw to build his nest in a tall cedar where while with his bill he be frame his building he lose as many feather from his wing as he lay straw in his nest yet scamble to catch hold to harbour in the house he have make he so fall from the bough where he stand and then pitiful cast up his eye he cry in such term as I imagine as may either condemn the nature of such a tree or the dare of such a mind while he lie quake upon the ground and I gaze one the cedar I may perceive ant to breed in the rind covet only to hoard and caterpillar to cleave to the leaf labour only to suck which cause more leaf to fall from the tree then there do feather before from the dove methinks Mileta I sigh in my sleep pity both the fortune of the bird and the misfortune of the tree but in this time quill begin to bud again in the bird which make he look as though he will fly up and then wish I that the body of the tree will bow that he may but creep up the tree then and so hey ho 

and so what 

Nothing Mileta but and so I wake but do nobody dream but I 

I dream last night but I hope dream be contrary that hold my head over a sweet smoke all my hair blaze on a bright flame methinks Ismena cast water to quench it yet the spark fall on my bosom and wipe they away with my hand I be all in a gore blood till one with a few fresh flower staunch it and so stretch myself as stiff I start it be but a dream 

it be a sign you shall fall in love with hear fair word water signify counsel flower death and nothing can purge your love humour but death 

you be no interpreter but a interpreter harp always upon love till you be as blind as a harper 

I remember last night but one I dream my eye tooth be lose and that I thrust it out with my tongue 

it foretell the loss of a friend and I ever think thou so full of prattle that thou will thrust out the best friend with the tattle 

yea Mileta but it be loose before and if my friend be lose as good thrust out with plain word as keep in with dissemble 

dream be but dote which come either by thing we see in the day or meat that we eat and so the common sense prefer it to be the imaginative 

soft philosophatrix well see in the secret of art and not seduce with the superstition of nature 

Ismena tongue never lie still I think all her tooth will be loose they be so often jog against her tongue but say on Eugenua 

there be all 

what do you dream Canope 

I seldom dream madam but sithence your sickness I can tell whether with over watch but I have have many fantastical vision for even now slumber by your bed side methinks I be shadow with a cloud where labour to unwrap myself I be more entangle but in the midst of my strive it seem to myself gold with fair drop I fill my lap and run to show it my fellow it turn to dust I blush they laugh and than I wake be glad it be but a dream 

take heed Canope that gold tempt not your lap and than you blush for shame 

it be good luck to dream of gold 

yea if it have continue gold 

I dream every night and the last night this i though that walk in the sun I be sting with the fly tarantula who venom nothing can expel but the sweet consent of music I try all kind of instrument but find no ease till at the last two lute tune in one key so glut my thirst ear that my grief present seize for joy whereof as I be clap my hand your ladyship call 

it be a sign that nothing shall assuage your love but marriage for such be the tie of two in wedlock as be the tune of two lute in one key for strike the string of the one straw will stir upon the string of the other and in two mind link in love one can be delight but the other rejoice 

methinks go by the sea side among pebble I see one play with a round stone ever throw it into the water when the sun shine I ask the name he say it be call Abeston which be once hot will never be cold he give it i and vanish I forget myself delight with the fair show will always show it by candle light pull it out in the sun and see how bright it will look in the fire where catch heat nothing can cool it for anger I throw it against the wall and with the heave up of my arm I wake 

beware of love Favilla for woman heart be such stone which warm by affection can be cold by wisdom 

I warrant you for I never credit man word 

yet be wary for woman be scorch sometime with man eye though they have rather consume than confess 

cease your talk for I will fain sleep to see if I can dream whether the bird have feather or the aunt wing draw the curtain 

Come Cupid Vulcan flame must quench Venus fire Vulcan 

who 

Venus 

ho ho Venus 

Come sweet Vulcan thou know how sweet thou have find Venus who be of all the goddess the most fair have choose thou of all the god the most foul thou must needs then confess I be most love inquire not the cause of my suit by question but prevent the effect by courtesy make i six arrow head it be give thou of the god by permission to frame they to any purpose I shall request they by prayer why lour thou Vulcan will thou have a kiss hold up thy head Venus have young thought and fresh affection root have string when bough have no leaf but hearken in thy ear Vulcan how say thou 

Vulcan be a god with you when you be dispose to flatter a right woman who tongue be like a bee sting which prick deep when it be full of honey because you have make my eye drink with fair look you will set my ear on edge with sweet word you be wont to say that the beat of hammer make your head ache and the smoke of the forge your eye water and every coal be a block in your way you weep rose water when you ask and spit vinegar when you have obtain what will you now with new arrow belike Mars have a tough skin one his heart or Cupid a weak arm or Venus a better courage well Venus there be never a smile in your face but have make a wrinkle in my forehead Ganymede must fill your cup and you will pledge none but jupiter but I will not chide Venus come Cyclops my wife must have she will let we do that in earth which the god can undo in heaven 

gramercy sweet Vulcan to your work 

here Venus I have finish these arrow by art bestow they you by wit for as great advice must he use that have they as he cunning that make they 

Vulcan now you have do with your forge let we alone with the fancy you be as the Fletcher not the archer to meddle with the arrow not the aim 

I think so when I have do work you have do woo where be now sweet Vulcan well I can say no more but this which be enough and as much as any can say Venus be a woman 

be not angry Vulcan I will love thou again when I have either business or nothing else to do 

my mother will make much of you when there be no more man than Vulcan 

Come Cupid receive with thy father instrument thy mother instruction for thou must be wise in conceit if thou will be fortunate in execution this arrow be feather with the wing of Aegitus which never sleep for fear of his hen the head touch with the stone Perillus which cause mistrust and jealousy shoot this Cupid at man that have fair wife which will make they rub the brow when they swell in the brain this shaft be head with lydian steel which strike a deep disdain of that which we most desire the feather be of turtle but dip in the blood of a tigress draw this up close to the head at Sappho that she may despise where now she dote good my boy gall she on the side that for Phaos love she may never sigh this arrow be feather with the phoenix wing and head with the eagles bill it make man passionate in desire in love constant and wise in conveyance melt as it be their fancy into faith this arrow sweet child and with as great aim as thou can must Phao be strike withal and cry soft to thyself in the very loose Venus sweet Cupid mistake i not I will make a quiver for that by itself the four have feather of the peacock but glue with the gum of the myrtle tree head with fine gold and fasten with brittle chrysocolla this shoot at dainty and coy lady at amiable and young nymph choose no other white but woman for this will work like in their mind but not love affability in speech but no faith courtly favour to be mistress over many but constant to none sigh to be fetch from the lung not the heart and tear to be wrong out with their finger not their eye secret laugh at man pale look and neat attire open rejoice at their own comeliness and man court shoot this arrow among the thick of they who bosom lie open because they will be strike with it And see man term woman Jupiter fool woman shall make man Venus fool this shaft be lead in the head and who feather be of the night raven a deadly and poison shaft which breed hate only against those which sue for love take heed Cupid thou hit not Phao with this shaft for then shall Venus perish this last be a old arrow but new mend the arrow which hit both Sappho and Phao work only in mean mind a aspire to superior and in high estate a stoop to inferior with this Cupid I be gall myself till thou have gall Phao with the other 

I warrant you I will cause Phao to languish in your love and Sappho to disdain his 

go loiter not nor mistake your shaft now Venus have thou play a cunning part though not current but why shall Venus dispute of unlawfulness in love or faith in affection be both the goddess of love and affection know there be as little truth to be use in love as there be reason no sweet Phao Venus will obtain because she be Venus not thou jove with thunder in thy hand shall take he out of my hand I have new arrow now for my boy and fresh flame at which the god shall tremble if they begin to trouble i but I will expect the event and tarry for Cupid at the forge 

what have thou do Cupid 

that my mother command Sappho 

my think I feel a alteration in my mind and as it be a withstand in myself of i own affection 

then have my arrow his effect 

I pray thou tell i the cause 

I dare not 

fear nothing for if Venus fret Sappho can frown thou shall be my son Mileta give he some sweet meat speak good Cupid and I will give thou many pretty thing 

my mother be in love with Phao she will i to strike you with disdain of he and he with desire of she 

o spiteful Venus Mileta give he some of that what else Cupid 

I can be even with my mother and so I will if I shall call you mother 

yea Cupid call i any thing so I may be even with she 

I have a arrow with which if I strike Phao it will cause he to loathe only Venus 

sweet Cupid strike Phao with it thou shall sit in my lap I will rock thou asleep and feed thou with all these fine knack 

I will about it 

but come quick again ah unkind Venus be this thy promise to Sappho but if I get Cupid from thou I myself will be the queen of love I will direct these arrow with better aim and conquer my own affection with great modesty Venus heart shall flame and her love be as common as her craft o Mileta time have disclose that which my temperance have keep in but sith I be rid of the disease I will not be ashamed to confess the cause I love Phao Mileta a thing unfit for my degree but force by my desire 

Phao 

Phao Mileta of who now Venus be enamour 

and do you love he still

alas poor Phao thy extreme love shall not be requite with so mean a fortune thy fair face deserve great favour I can love Venus have harden my heart 

I marvel Cupid come not all this while how now in Sappho lap 

yea Venus what say you to it in Sappho lap 

sir boy come hither 

I will not 

what now will you not have Sappho make you so saucy 

I will be Sappho son I have as you command strike she with a deep disdain of Phao and Phao as she entreat i with a great despite of you 

unhappy wag what have thou do I will make thou repent it every vain in thy heart 

Venus be not choleric Cupid be i he have give i his arrow and I will give he a new bow to shoot in you be not worthy to be the lady of love that yield so often to the impression of love immodest Venus that to satisfy the unbridle thought of thy heart transgress so far from the stay of thy honour how say thou Cupid will thou be with i 

yes 

shall not I be on earth the goddess of affection 

yes 

shall not I rule the fancy of man and lead Venus in chain like a captive 

yes 

it be a good boy 

what have we here you the goddess of love and you her son Cupid I will tame that proud heart else shall the god say they be not Venus friend and as for you sit boy I will teach you how to run away you shall be strip from top to toe and whip with nettle not rose I will set you to blow Vulcan coal not to bear Venus quiver I will handle you for this gear well I say no more but as for the new mistress of love or lady I cry you mercy I think you will be call a goddess you shall know what it be to usurp the name of Venus I will pull those plume and cause you to cast your eye on your foot not your feather your soft hair will I turn to hard bristle your tongue to a sting and those allure eye to unluckiness in which if the god aid i not I will curse the god 

Venus you be in a vain answerable to your vanity who high word neither become you nor fear i but let this suffice I will keep Cupid in despite of you and yet with the content of the god 

will you why then we shall have pretty god in heaven when you take God prisoner on earth before I sleep you shall both repent and find what it be but to think unreverent of Venus Come Cupid she know not how to use thou come with i you know what I have for you will you not 

not I 

well I will be even with you both and that short 

Cupid fear not I will direct thy arrow better every rude ass shall not say he be in love it be a toy make for lady and I will keep it only for lady 

but what will you do for Phao 

I will wish he fortunate this will I do for Phao because I once love Phao for never shall it be say that Sappho love to hate or that out of love she can not be as courteous as she be in love passionate Come Mileta shut the door 

go to Sibylla tell the begin of thy love and the end of thy fortune and lo how happy she sit in her cave Sibylla 

Phao welcome what news 

Venus the goddess of love I loathe Cupid cause it with a new shaft Sappho disdain i Venus cause it for a new spite o Sibylla if Venus be unfaithful in love where shall one fly for truth Shee use deceit be it not then likely she will dispense with subtlety And be careful to commit injury will she not be careless to revenge they I must now fall from love to labour and endeavour with my oar to get a fare not with my pen to write a fancy love be but smoke which vanish in the see and yet hurt while they be see a ferry Phao no the star can call it a worse fortune range rather over the world forswear affection entreat for death o Sappho thou haste Cupid in thy arm I in my heart thou kiss he for sport I must curse he for spite yet will I not curse he Sappho who thou kiss this shall be my resolution wherever I wander to be as I be ever kneel before Sappho my loyalty unspotted though unrewarded with as little malice will I go to my grave as I do lie with all in my cradle my life shall be spend in sigh and wish the one for my bad fortune the other for Sappho good 

do so Phao for destiny call thou aswell from Sicily as from love other thing hang over thy head which I must neither tell nor thou inquire and so farewell 

farewell Sibylla and farewell Sicily thought shall be thy food and in thy step shall be print behind thou that there be none so loyal leave behind thou farewell Syracuse unworthy to harbour faith and when I be go unless Sappho be here unlikely to harbour any
