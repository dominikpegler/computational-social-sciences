be purpose to resign a place my lord 
in which he have with such integrity 
perform the first and best part of a judge 
that as his life transcend all fair example 
of such as be before he in Dijon 
so it remain to those that shall succeed he 
a precedent they may imitate but not equal 

I may not sit to hear this 

let the love 
and thankfulness we be bind to pay to goodness 
in this overcome your modesty 

my thanks 
for this great favour shall prevent your trouble 
the honourable trust that be impose 
upon my weakness since you witness for i 
it be not ill discharge I will not mention 
nor now if age have not deprive i of 
the little strength I have to govern well 
the province that I under take forsake it 

that we can lend you of our year 

or strength 

or as you be persuade you to continue 
the noble exercise of your know judgement 

that may not be nor can your lordship goodness 
since your employment have confer upon i 
sufficient wealth deny the use of it 
and though old age when one foot be in the grave 
in many when all humour else be spend 
feed no affection in they but desire 
to add height to the mountain of their riches 
in i it be not so I rest content 
with the honour and estate I now possess 
and that I may have liberty to use 
what heaven still bless my poor industry 
have make i master of I pray the court 
to ease i of my burden that I may 
employ the small remainder of my life 
in live well and learn how to die so 

see sir our advocate 

the court entreat 
your lordship will be please to name the man 
which you will have your successor and in i 
all promise to confirm it 

I embrace it 
as a assurance of their favour to i 
and name my lord Novall 

the court allow it 

but there be suitor wait here and their cause 
may be of more necessity to be hear 
and therefore wish that i may be defer 
and they have hear 

if your lordship please 
to take the place we will proceed 

the cause 
we come to offer to your lordship censure 
be in itself so noble that it need not 
or rhetoric in i that plead or favour 
from your grave lordship to determine of it 
since to the praise of your impartial justice 
which guilty nay condemn man dare not scandal 
it will erect a trophy of your mercy 
with marry to that justice 

speak to the cause 

I will my lord to say the late dead marshal 
the father of this young lord here my client 
have do his country great and faithful service 
may task i of impertinence to repeat 
what your grave lordship can but remember 
he in his life become indebt to 
these thrifty man I will not wrong their credit 
by give they the attribute they now merit 
and fail by the fortune of the war 
of mean to free himself from his engagement 
he be arrest and for want of bail 
imprison at their suit and not long after 
with loss of liberty end his life 
and though it be a maxim in our law 
all suit die with the person these man malice 
in death find matter for their hate to work on 
deny he the decent rite of burial 
which the swear enemy of the christian faith 
grant free to their slave may it therefore please 
your lordship so to fashion your decree 
that what their cruelty do forbid your pity 
may give allowance to 

how long have you sir practise in court 

some twenty year my lord 

by your gross ignorance it shall appear 
not twenty day 

I hope I have give no cause in this my lord 

How dare you move the court 
to the dispense with a act confirm 
by parliament to the terror of all bankrupt 
go home and with more care peruse the statute 
or the next motion savour of this boldness 
may force you to leap against your will 
over the place you plead at 

I foresee this 

why do your lordship think the move of 
a cause more honest than this court have ever 
the honour to determine can deserve 
a check like this 

strange boldness 

it be fit freedom 
or do you conclude a advocate can hold 
his credit with the judge unless he study 
his face more than the cause for which he plead 

forbear 

or can you that have the power 
to qualify the rigour of the law 
when you be please take a little from 
the strictness of your sour decree enact 
in favour of the greedy creditor 
against the overthrow debtor 

sirrah you that prate 
thus saucy what be you 

why I will tell you 
thou purplecoloured man I be one to who 
thou owe the mean thou have of sit there 
a corrupt elder 

forbear 

the nose thou wear be my gift and those eye 
that meet no object so base as their master 
have be long since tear from that guilty head 
and thou thyself slave to some needy Swiss 
have I not wear a sword and use it better 
than in thy prayer thou ere do thy tongue 

shall such a insolence pass unpunished 

hear i 

yet I that in my service do my country 
disdain to be put in the scale with thou 
confess myself unworthy to be value 
with the least part nay hair of the dead marshal 
of who so many glorious undertake 
make choice of any one and that the mean 
perform against the subtle fox of France 
the politic Lewis or the more desperate Swiss 
and it will outweigh all the good purpose 
though put in act that ever gownman practise 

away with he to prison 

if that curse 
urge just and breathe forth so ever fall 
on those that do deserve they let not my 
be spend in vain now that thou from this instant 
may in thy fear that they will fall upon thou 
be sensible of the plague they shall bring with they 
and for deny of a little earth 
to cover what remain of our great soldier 
may all your wife prove whore your factor thief 
and while you live your riotous heir undo you 
and thou the patron of their cruelty 
of all thy lordship live not to be owner 
of so much dung as will conceal a dog 
or what be worse thyself in and thy year 
to the end thou may be wretched I wish many 
and as thou have deny the dead a grave 
may misery in thy life make thou desire one 
which man and all the element keep from thou 
I have begin well imitate exceed 

good counsel be it a praise worthy deed Ex officer with Rom 

Remember what we be 

thus low my duty 
answer your lordship counsel I will use 
in the few word with which I be to trouble 
your lordship ear the temper that you wish i 
not that I fear to speak my thought as loud 
and with a liberty beyond Romont 
but that I know for i that be make up 
of all that be wretched so to haste my end 
will seem to most rather a willingness 
to quit the burden of a hopeless life 
then scorn of death or duty to the dead 
I therefore bring the tribute of my praise 
to your severity and commend the justice 
that will not for the many service 
that any man have do the common wealth 
wink at his least of ill what though my father 
write man before he be so and confirm it 
by number that day no part of his life 
in which he do not service to his country 
be he to be free therefore from the law 
and ceremonious form in your decree 
or else because he do as much as man 
in those three memorable overthrow 
a Granson Morat Nancy where his master 
the warlike Charloyes with who misfortune 
I bear his name lose treasure man and life 
to be excuse from payment of those sum 
which his own patrimony spend his zeal 
to serve his country force he to take up 

the president be ill 

and yet my lord this much 
I know you will grant after those great defeature 
which in their dreadful ruin bury quick enter officer 
courage and hope in all man but himself 
he force the proud foe in his height of conquest 
to yield unto a honourable peace 
and in it save a hundred thousand life 
to end his own that be sure proof against 
the scald summer heat and winter frost 
ill air the cannon and the enemy sword 
in a most loathsome prison 

it be his fault to be so prodigal 

he have from the state sufficient entertainment for the army 

sufficient my lord you sit at home 
and though your fee be boundless at the bar 
be thrifty in the charge of the war 
but your will be obey to these I turn 
to these softhearted man that wise know 
they be only good man that pay what they owe 

and so they be 

it be the city doctrine 
we stand bind to maintain it 

be constant in it 
and since you be as merciless in your nature 
as base and mercenary in your mean 
by which you get your wealth I will not urge 
the court to take away one scruple from 
the right of their law or one good thought 
in you to mend your disposition with 
I know there be no music to your ear 
so please as the groan of man in prison 
and that the tear of widow and the cry 
of famish orphan be the feast that take you 
that to be in your danger with more care 
shall be avoid then infectious air 
the loathe embrace of disease woman 
a flatterer poison or the loss of honour 
yet rather than my father reverent dust 
shall want a place in that fair monument 
in which our noble ancestor lie entomb 
before the court I offer up myself 
a prisoner for it load i with those iron 
that have wear out his life in my best strength 
I will run to the encounter of cold hunger 
and choose my dwelling where no sun dare enter 
so he may be release 

what mean you sir

already in this cause and say so well 
that shall I only offer to speak in it 
I shall not be hear or laugh at for it

and well considerate you throw away 
your liberty and joy of life together

that be not sensible of it with which wise man 
never abuse his goodness the great virtue 
of your dead father vindicate themselves 
from these man malice and break open the prison 
though it contain his body 

let he alone 
if he love lord a god name let he wear they 
provide these consent 

I hope they be not 
so ignorant in any way of profit 
as to neglect a possibility 
to get their own by seek it from that 
which can return they nothing but ill fame 
and curse for their barbarous cruelty 

what think you of the offer 

very well 

accept it by all means let we shut he up 
he be wellshaped and have a villainous tongue 
and shall he study that way of revenge 
as I dare almost swear he love a wench 
we have no wife nor never shall get daughter 
that will hold out against he 

what be your answer 

speak you for all 

why let our execution 
that lie upon the father be return 
upon the son and we release the body 

the court must grant you that 

I thank your lordship 
they have in it confirm on i such glory 
as no time can take from i I be ready 
come lead i where you please captivity 
that come with honour be true liberty 

strange rashness 

a brave resolution rather 
worthy a better fortune but however 
it be not now to be dispute therefore 
to my own cause already I have find 
your lordship bountiful in your favour to i 
and that shall teach my modesty to end here 
and press your love no further 

there be nothing 
the court can grant but with assurance you 
may ask it and obtain it 

you encourage a bold petitioner and it be not fit 
your favour shall be lose besides it have be 
a custom many year at the surrender 
the place I now give up to grant the precedent 
one boon that part with it and to confirm 
your grace towards i against all such as may 
detract my action and life hereafter 
I now prefer it to you 

speak it free 

I then desire the liberty of Romont 
and that my lord Novall who private wrong 
be equal to the injury that be do 
to the dignity of the court will pardon it 
and now sign his enlargement 

pray you demand 
the moiety of my estate or any thing 
within my power but this 

be I deny then my first and last request 

it must not be 

I have a voice to give in it 

and I 
and if persuasion will not work he to it 
we will make know our power

I thank your lordship 

the court be up make way Ex omnes prater Roch and Beaumont 

I follow you Beaumont 

my lord 

you be a scholar Beaumont 
and can search deep into the intent of man 
than those that be less know how appear 
the piety and brave behaviour of 
young Charloyes to you 

it be my wonder 
since I want language to express it full 
and sure the colonel 

fie he be faulty what present money have I 

there be no want 
of any sum a private man have use for 

it be well 
I be strange take with this Charlaloys 
methinks from his example the whole age 
shall learn to be good and continue so 
virtue work strange with we and his goodness 
rise above his fortune seem to i 
princelike to will not ask a courtesy exeunt 

it be strange 

methinks so 

in a man but young 
yet old in judgement theoric and practic 
in all humanity and to increase the wonder 
religious yet a soldier that he shall 
yield his free live youth a captive for 
the freedom of his age father corpse 
and rather choose to want life necessary 
liberty hope of fortune than it shall 
in death be keep from christian ceremony 

Come it be a golden precedent in a son 
to let strong nature have the better hand 
in such a case of all affect reason 
what year sit on this Charalois 

twenty eight for since the clock do strike he 17 old 
under his father wing this son have fight 
serve and command and so apt both 
that sometime he appear his father father 
and never less than his son the old man virtue 
so recent in he as the world may swear 
nought but a fair tree can such fair fruit bear 

but wherefore let he such a barbarous law 
and man more barbarous to execute it 
prevail on his soft disposition 
that he have rather die alive for debt 
of the old man in prison than he shall 
rob he of sepulture consider 
these money borrow buy the lender peace 
and all their mean they enjoy nor be diffuse 
in any impious or licentious path 

true for my part be it my father trunk 
the tyrannous ramhead with their horn shall gore it 
or cast it to their cur than they less currish 
ere prey on i so with their lionlaw 
be in my free will as in his to shun it 

alas he know himself in poverty lose 
for in this partial avaricious age 
what price bear honour virtue long ago 
it be but praise and freeze but nowadays 
it be cold far and have nor love nor praise 
very praise now freeze too for nature

then knowledge we less heathenish christian

who be your father and who wife you now be 
that I choose rather not to understand 
your nasty scoff then 

what you will not beat i

my intent 
madam deserve not this nor do I stay 
to be the whetstone of your wit preserve it 
to spend on such as know how to admire 
such colour stuff in i there be now speak to you 
as true a friend and servant to your honour 
and one that will with as much hazard guard it 
as ever man do goodness but then lady 
you must endeavour not alone to be 
but to appear worthy such love and service 

to what tend this 

why to this purpose lady 
I do desire you shall prove such a wife 
to Charlaloys and such a one he merit 
as Caesar do he live can not except at 
not only innocent from crime but free 
from all taint and suspicion 

they be base that judge i otherwise 

but yet be careful 
detraction be a bold monster and fear not 
to wound the fame of prince if it find 
but any blemish in their life to work on 
but I will be plain with you have the people 
be learn to speak but what even now I see 
their malice out of that will raise a engine 
to overthrow your honour in my sight 
with yonder point fool I fright from you 
you use familiarity beyond 
a modest entertainment you embrace he 
with too much ardour for a stranger and 
meet he with kiss neither chaste nor comely 
but learn you to forget he as I will 
your bounty to he you will find it safe 
rather to be uncourtly then immodest 

this pretty rag about your neck show well 
and be course and little worth it speak you 
as terrible as thrifty 

madam 

yes 
and this strong belt in which you hang your honour 
will outlast twenty scarf 

what mean you lady 

and all else about you cap a pe 
so uniform in spite of handsomeness 
show such a bold contempt of comeliness 
that it be not strange your laundress in the league 
grow mad with love of you 

be my free counsel 
answer with this ridiculous scorn 

these object 
steal very much of my attention from i 
yet something I remember to speak truth 
deceive grave but to little purpose 
that almost will have make i swear some curate 
have steal into the person of Romont 
and in the praise of good wife honesty 
have read a homely 

by thy hand 

and sword 
I will make up your oath it will want weight else 
you be angry with i and poor I laugh at it 
do you come from the camp which afford only 
the conversation of cast suburb whore 
to set down to a lady of my rank 
limit of entertainment 

sure a legion have possess this woman 

one stamp more will do well yet I desire not 
you shall grow hornmad till you have a wife 
you be come to warm meat and perhaps clean linen 
feed wear it and be thankful for i know 
that though a thousand watch be set on i 
and you the masterspy I yet will use 
the liberty that best like i I will revel 
feast kiss embrace perhaps grant large favour 
yet such as live upon my mean shall know 
they must not murmur at it if my lord 
be now grow yellow and have choose out you 
to serve his jealousy that way tell he this 
you have something to inform he Exit Beau 

and I will 
believe it wicked one I will hear heaven 
but hear pardon i if these fruit grow 
upon the tree of marriage let i shun it 
as a forbid sweet a heir and rich 
young beautiful yet add to this a wife 
and I will rather choose a hospital sinner 
cart a age before though three part rot 
and take it for a blessing rather than 
be fetter to the hellish slavery 
of such a impudence 

colonel good fortune 
to meet you thus you look sad but I will tell you 
something that shall remove it o how happy 
be my lord Charlaloys in his fair bride

all he do now possess in Burgundy 
these write to confirm it be new seal 
and I most fortunate to present he with they 
I must go seek he out can you direct i 

you will find he break a young horse 

I thank you Exit Beaumont 

I must do something worthy Charlaloys friendship 
if she be well incline to keep she so 
deserve not thanks and yet to stay a woman 
spur headlong by hot lust to her own ruin 
be hard than to prop a fall tower 
with a deceive reed enter Rochfort 

some one seek for i 
as soon as he return 

her father ha 
how if I break this to he sure it can 
meet with a ill construction his wisdom 
make powerful by the authority of a father 
will warrant and give privilege to his counsel 
it shall be so my lord 

your friend Romont will you ought with i 

I stand so engage 
to your so many favour that I hold it 
a breach in thankfulness shall I not discover 
though with some imputation to myself 
all doubt that may concern you 

the performance 
will make this protestation worth my thank 

then with your patience lend i your attention 
for what I must deliver whisper only

but ere it set shall show her ugly lust 
in a new shape and every on more horrid

Keep from i can not one good thought rise up 
to tell you that she be my age comfort 
beget by a weak man and bear a woman 
and can not therefore but partake of frailty 
or wherefore do not thankfulness step forth

object unto you since you prove ungrateful 
flintyhearted Charlaloys

to pierce the heart of design against i 
I find it now it be may state be aim at 
a noble match be seek for and the hour 
I live grow tedious to you my compassion 
towards you have render i most miserable 
and foolish charity undo myself 
but there be a heaven above from who just wreak 
no mist of policy can hide offender enter Novall se with officer

it be you give liberty to this bloody wolf 
to worry all our comfort but this be 
no time to quarrel now give your assistance 
for the revenge 

call it a fit name justice for innocent blood 

though all conspire 
against that life which I be weary of 
a little long yet I will strive to keep it 
to show in spite of malice and their law 
his plea must speed that have a honest cause exeunt 

why it be both most unconscionable and untimely 
to arrest a gallant for his clothes before 
he have wear they out beside you say you ask 
my name in my lord bond but for i only 
and now you will lay i up for it do not think 
the take measure of a customer 
by a brace of varlet though I rather wait 
never so patient will prove a fashion 
which any courtier or inn of court man 
will follow willing 

there I believe you 
but sir I must have present money or 
assurance to secure i when I shall 
or I will see to your come forth 

plague on it 
you have provide for my entrance in 
that come forth you talk of concern i 
what shall I do you have do i a disgrace 
in the arrest but more in give cause 
to all the street to think I can stand 
without these two supporter for my arm 
pray you let they lose i for their satisfaction 
I will not run away 

for they you will not 
but for your own you will look to they fellow 

why do you call they fellow do not wrong 
your reputation so as you be mere 
a tailor faithful apt to believe in gallant 
you be a companion at a ten crown supper 
for cloth of bodkin and may with one lark 
eat up three manchet and no man observe you 
or call your trade in question for it but when 
you study your debtbook and hold correspondence 
with officer of the hanger and leave swordman 
the learned conclude the tailor and sergeant 
in the expression of a knave be these 
to be synonimon look therefore to it 
and let we part in peace I will be loath 
you shall undo yourself 

to let you go enter old Novall and Pontalier 
Were the next way 
but see here be your old lord 
let he but give his word I shall be pay 
and you be free

I can be but deny or what say you 
his lordship owe i three time your debt 
if you arrest he at my suit and let i 
go run before to see the action enter 
it will be a witty jest 

I must have earnest 
I can pay my debt so 

can your lordship 
imagine while I live and wear a sword 
your son death shall be revenge 

I know not 
one reason why you shall not do like other 
I be sure of all the herd that feed upon he 
I can see in any now he be go 
in pity or in thankfulness one true sign 
of sorrow for he 

all his bounty yet 
fall not in such unthankful ground it be true 
he have weakness but such as few be free from 
and though none soothe they less than I for now 
to say that I foresee the danger that 
will rise from cherish they be but untimely 
I yet can wish the justice that you seek for 
in the revenge have be trust to i 
and not the uncertain issue of the law 
it have robe i of a noble testimony 
of what I dare do for he but however 
my forfeit life redeem by he though dead 
shall do he service 

as far as my grief 
will give i leave I thank you 

o my lord 
o my good lord deliver i from these fury

and object flattery help to dig his grave

I will do nothing for thou 

nor you captain 

no to your trade again put off this case 
it may be the discover what you be 
when your unfortunate master take you up 
may move compassion in your creditor 
Confess the truth Exit Novall se Pont 

and now I think on it better 
I will brother your hand your hand sweet brother 
I be of your sect and my gallantry but a dream 
out of which these two fearful apparition 
against my will have wake i this rich sword 
grow sudden out of a tailor bodkin 
these hanger from my veil and fee in hell 
and where as now this beaver sit full often 
a thrifty cape compose of broad cloth list 
here kin unto the cushion where I sit 
crosslegged and yet ungartered have be see 
our breakfast famous for the butter loaf 
I have with joy be oft acquaint with 
and therefore use a conscience though it be 
forbid in our hall towards other man 
to i that as I have be will again 
be of the brotherhood 

I know he now 
he be a apprentice to le robe at Orleans 

and from thence bring by my young lord now dead 
unto Dijon and with he till this hour 
have be receive here for a complete monsieur 
nor wonder at it for but tithe our gallant 
even those of the first rank and you will find 
in every ten one peradventure two 
that smell rank of the dance school or fiddle 
the pantofle or press iron but hereafter 
we will talk of this I will surrender up 
my suit again there can be much loss 
it be but the turn of the lace with one 
addition more you know of and what want 
I will work out 

then here our quarrel end 
the gallant be turn tailor and all friend exeunt 

you have they ready 

yes and they will speak 
their knowledge in this cause when thou think fit 
to have they call upon 

it be well and something 
I can add to their evidence to prove 
this brave revenge which they will have call murder 
a noble justice 

in this you express 
the breach by my lord want of you new make up 
a faithful friend 

that friendship be raise on sand 
which every sudden gust of discontent 
or flow of our passion can change 
as if it never have be but do you know 
who be to sit on he 

monsieur Du 
assist by Charmi 

the advocate 
that plead for the marshal funeral 
and be check for it by Novall 

the same 

how fortune that 

why sir my lord Novall 
be the accuser can be the judge 
nor will grieve Rochfort but lord Charlaloys 
however he may wrong he by his power 
shall have a equal hear 

by my hope 
of Charlaloys acquittal I lament 
that reverent old man fortune 

have you see he 
as to my grief I have now promise patience 
and ere it be believe though speak by he 
that never break his word enrage again 
so far as to make war upon those heir 
which not a barbarous scythian dare presume 
to touch but with a superstitious fear 
as something sacred and then curse his daughter 
but with more frequent violence himself 
as if he have be guilty of her fault 
by be incredulous of your report 
you will not only judge he worthy pity 
but suffer with he enter Charlaloys with officer 
but here come the prisoner 
I dare not stay to do my duty to he 
yet rest assure all possible mean in i 
to do he service keep you company Exit Bau 

it be not doubt 

why yet as I come hither 
the people apt to mock calamity 
and tread on the oppress make no hormes at i 
though they be too familiar I deserve they 
And know what blood my sword have drink 
in wreak of that disgrace they yet forbear 
to shake their head or to revile i for 
a murderer they rather all put on 
as for great loss the old roman use 
a general face of sorrow weight on 
by a sad murmur break through their silence 
and no eye but be ready with a tear 
to witness it be shed for i than I can 
discern a face make up with scorn against i 
why shall I then though for unusual wrong 
I choose unusual mean to right those wrong 
condemn myself as overpartial 
in my own cause Romont 

best friend well meet 
by my heart love to you and join to that 
my thankfulness that still live to the dead 
I look upon you now with more true joy 
then when I see you marry 

you have reason 
to give you warrant for it my fall off 
from such a friendship with the scorn that answer 
your too prophetic counsel may well move you 
to think your meeting i go to my death 
a fit encounter for that hate which just 
I have deserve from you 

shall I still then 
speak truth and be ill understand 

you be not 
I be conscious I have wrong you and allow i 
only a moral man to look on you 
who foolish I have abuse and injure 
must of necessity be more terrible to i 
than any death the judge can pronounce 
from the tribunal which I be to plead at 

passion transport you 

for what I have do 
to my false lady or Novall I can 
give some apparent cause but touch you 
in my defence childlike I can say nothing 
but I be sorry for it a poor satisfaction 
and yet mistake i not for it be more 
than I will speak to have my pardon sign 
for all I stand accuse of 

you much weaken the strength of your good cause 
shall you but think 
a man for do well can entertain 
a pardon be it offer you have give 
to blind and slowpaced justice wing and eye 
to see and overtake impiety 
which from a cold proceed have receive 
indulgence or protection 

think you so 

upon my soul nor shall the blood you challenge 
and take to cure your honour breed more scruple 
in your soft conscience then if your sword 
have be sheathe in a tiger or she bear 
that in their bowel will have make your tomb 
to injure innocence be more than murder 
but when inhuman lust transform we then 
as beast we be to suffer not like man 
to be lament nor do Charalois ever 
Perform a act so worthy the applause 
of a full theater of perfect man 
as he have do in this the glory get 
by overthrow outward enemy 
since strength and fortune be main sharer in it 
we can but by piece call our own 
but when we conquer our intestine foe 
our passion breed within we and of those 
the most rebellious tyrant powerful love 
our reason suffer we to like no long 
then the fair object be good deserve it 
that be true victory which be great man 
ambitious to achieve by your example 
set no price upon the breach of faith 
but loss of life it will fright adultery 
out of their family and make lust appear 
as loathsome to we in the first consent 
as when it be wait on by punishment 

you have confirm i who will love a woman 
that may enjoy in such a man a friend 
you have make i know the justice of my cause 
and mark i out the way how to defend it 

continue to that resolution constant 
and you shall in contempt of their worst malice 
come off with honour here they come 

I be ready 

see equal judge with what confidence 
the cruel murderer stand as if he will 
outface the court and justice 

but look on he 
and you shall find for still methinks I do 
though guilt have die he black something good in he 
that may perhaps work with a wise man 
than I have be again to set he free 
and give he all he have 

this be not well 
I will you have live so my lord that I 
may rather have continue your poor servant 
then sit here as your judge 

I be sorry for you 

in no act of my life I have discern 
this injury from the court that any here 
shall thus uncivil usurp on what 
be proper to i only 

what distaste 
receive my lord 

you say you be sorry for he 
a grief in which I must not have a partner 
it be I alone be sorry that I raise 
the build of my life for seventy year 
upon so sure a ground that all the vice 
practise to ruin man though bring against i 
can never undermine and no way leave 
to send these grey hair to the grave with sorrow 
virtue that be my patroness betray i 
for enter nay possess this young man 
it lend he such a powerful majesty 
to grace whatever he undertake that free 
I give myself up with my liberty 
to be at his dispose have his person 
lonely I must confess or far feign valour 
or any other seem good that yet 
hold a near neighbourhood with ill wrought on i 
I may have bear it better but when goodness 
and piety itself in her best figure 
be bribe to my destruction can you blame i 
though I forget to suffer like a man 
or rather act a woman 

good my lord 

you hinder our proceed 

and forget 
the part of a accuser 

pray you remember 
to use the temper which to i you promise 

angel themselves must break Beaumont that promise 
beyond the strength and patience of angel 
but I have do my good lord pardon i 
a weak old man and pray add to that 
a miserable father yet be careful 
that your compassion of my age nor he 
move you to any thing that may disbecome 
the place on which you fit 

Read the indictment 

it shall be needless I myself my lord 
will be my own accuser and confess 
all they can charge i with or will I spare 
to aggravate that guilt with circumstance 
they seek to load i with only I pray 
that as for they you will vouchsafe i hear 
I may not be deny it for myself 
when I shall urge by what unanswerable reason 
I be compel to what I do which yet 
till you have teach i better I repent not 

the motion honest 

and it be free grant 

then I confess my lord that I stand bind 
when with my friend even hope itself have leave i 
to this man charity for my liberty 
nor do his bounty end there but begin 
for after my enlargement cherish 
the good he do he make i master of 
his only daughter and his whole estate 
great tie of thankfulness I must acknowledge 
can any one free by you press this further 
but yet consider my most honour lord 
if to receive a favour make a servant 
and benefit be bond to tie the taker 
to the imperious will of he that give 
there be none but slave will receive courtesy 
since they must fetter we to our dishonour 
can it be call magnificence in a prince 
to pour down riches with a liberal hand 
upon a poor man want if that must bind he 
to play the soothe parasite to his vice 
or any man because he save my hand 
presume my head and heart be at his service 
or do I stand engage to buy my freedom 
when my captivity be honourable 
by make myself here and fame hereafter 
bondslave to man scorn and calumnious tongue 
have his fair daughter mind be like she feature 
or for some little blemish I have seek 
for my content elsewhere waste on other 
my body and her dowry my forehead then 
deserve the brand of base ingratitude 
but if obsequious usage and fair warning 
to keep her worth my love can preserve she 
from be a whore and yet no cunning one 
so to offend and yet the fault keep from i 
what shall I do let any freeborn spirit 
determine true if that thankfulness 
choice form with the whole world give for a dowry 
can strengthen so a honest man with patience 
as with a willing neck to undergo 
the insupportable yoke of slave or wit toll 

what proof have you she do play false beside your oath 

her own confession to her father 
I ask he for a witness 

it be most true 
I will not willing blend my last word 
with a untruth 

and then to clear myself 
that his great wealth be not the mark I shoot at 
but that I hold it when fair Beaumelle 
fall from her virtue like the fatal gold 
which Brennus take from Delphos who possession 
bring with it ruin to himself and army 
here is one in court Beaumont by who I send 
all grant and write back which make it i 
before his daughter die by his own sentence 
as free as unasked he give it to i 

they be here to be see 

open the casket 
peruse that deed of gift 

half of the danger 
already be discharge the other part 
as brave and you be not only free 
but crown with praise for ever 

it be apparent 

your state my lord again be you 

not i 
I be not of the world if it can prosper 
and yet be just get I will not examine 
why it shall be so fatal do you bestow it 
on pious use I will go seek a grave 
and yet for proof I die in peace your pardon 
I ask and as you grant it i may heaven 
your conscience and these judge free you from exit Roch 
what you be charge with so farewell for ever 

I will be my own guide passion nor example 
shall be my leader I have lose a son 
a son grave judge I require his blood 
from his accurse homicide 

what reply you 
in your defence for this 

ay but attend 
your lordship pleasure for the fact as of 
the former I confess it but with what 
base wrong I be unwilling draw to it 
to my few word there be some other proof 
to witness this for truth when I be marry 
for there I must begin the slay Novall 
be to my wife in way of our french courtship 
a most devote servant but yet aim at 
nothing but mean to quench his wanton heat 
his heart be never warm by lawful fire 
as i be lord and though on these presumption 
join to the hate between his house and i 
I may with opportunity and ease 
have find a way for my revenge I do not 
but still he have the freedom as before 
when all be i and tell that he abuse it 
with some unseemly licence by my friend 
my approve friend Romont I give no credit 
to the reporter but reprove he for it 
as one uncourtly and malicious to he 
what can I more my lord yet after this 
he do continue in his first pursuit 
hot than ever and at length obtain it 
but how it come to my most certain knowledge 
for the dignity of the court and my own honour 
I dare not say 

if all may be believe 
a passionate prisoner speak who be so foolish 
that dare be wicked that will appear guilty 
no my grave lord in his impunity 
but give example unto jealous man 
to cut the throat they hate and they will never 
want matter or pretence for their bad end 

you must find other proof to strengthen these 
but mere presumption 

or we shall hardly 
allow your innocence 

all your attempt 
shall fall on i like brittle shaft on armour 
that break themselves or like wave against a rock 
that leave no sign of their ridiculous fury 
but foam and splinter my innocence like these 
shall stand triumphant and your malice serve 
but for a trumpet to proclaim my conquest 
nor shall you though you do the worst fate can 
however condemn affright a honest man 

may it please the court I may be hear 

you come not 
to rail again but do you shall not find 
another Rochfort 

in Novall I can 
but I come furnish with what will stop 
the mouth of his conspiracy against the life 
of innocent Charaloys do you know this character 

yes it be my son 

may it please your lordship read it 
and you shall find there with what vehemency 
he do solicit Beaumelle how he have get 
a promise from she to enjoy his wish 
how after he abjure her company 
and yet but that it be fit I spare the dead 
like a damn villain assoon as record 
he break that oath to make this manifest 
produce his band and she 

have they take their oath 

they have and rather than endure the rack 
confess the time the meeting nay the act 
what will you more only this matron make 
a free discovery to a good end 
and therefore I sue to the court she may not 
be place in the black list of the delinquent 

I see by this noval revenge need i 
and I shall do 

it be evident 

that I 
till now be never wretched here be no place 
to curse he or my star Exit Novall senior 

lord Charalois 
the injury you have sustain appear 
so worthy of the mercy of the court 
that notwithstanding you have go beyond 
the letter of the law they yet acquit you 

but in Novall I do condemn he thus 

I be slay 

can I look on o murderous wretch 
thy challenge now I answer to die with he 

a guard disarm he 

I yield up my sword 
unforced o Charlaloys 

for shame Romont 
Mourn not for he that die as he have live 
still constant and unmoved what be fall upon i 
be by heaven will because I make myself 
a judge in my own cause without their warrant 
but he that let i know thus much in death 
with all good man forgive i 

I receive the vengeance which my love 
not build on virtue have make i worthy worthy of 

we be teach 
by this sad precedent how just soever 
our reason be to remedy our wrong 
we be yet to leave they to their will and power 
that to that purpose have authority 
for you Romont although in your excuse 
you may plead what you do be in revenge 
of the dishonour do unto the court 
yet since from we you have not warrant for it 
we banish you the state for these they shall 
as they be find guilty or innocent 
be set free or suffer punishment exeunt omnes
