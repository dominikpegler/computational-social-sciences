nay my dear asper 

stay your mind 

away 
who be so patient of this impious world 
that he can check his spirit or rein his tongue 
or who have such a dead unfeeling sense 
that heaven horrid thunder can wake 
to see the earth crack with the weight of sin 
hell gape under we and over our head 
black ravenous ruin with her sailstretched wing 
ready to sink we down and cover we 
who can behold such prodigy as these 
and have his lip seal up not I my soul 
be never ground into such oily colour 
to flatter vice and daub iniquity 
but with a arm and resolve hand 
I will strip the ragged folly of the time 
naked as at their birth 

be not too bold 

you trouble i and with a whip of steel 
print wound lash in their iron rib 
I fear no mood stamp in a private brow 
when I be please to unmask a public vice 
I fear no strumpet drug nor ruffian stab 
shall I detect their hateful luxury 
no broker usurer or lawyer gripe 
be I dispose to say they be all corrupt 
I fear no courtier frown shall I applaud 
the easy flexure of his supple ham 
tut these be so innate and popular 
that drunken custom will not shame to laugh 
in scorn at he that shall but dare to tax they 
and yet not one of these but know his work 
know what damnation be the devil and hell 
yet hourly they persist grow rank in sin 
puff their soul away in perjurious air 
to cherish their extortion pride or lust 

forbear good asper be not like your name 

o but to such who face be all zeal 
and with the word of Hercules invade 
such crime as these that will not smell of sin 
but seem as they be make of sanctity 
religion in their garment and their hair 
cut short than their kickshaw when the conscience 
be vast than the ocean and devour 
more wretch than the counter 

gentle asper 

unless your breath have power 
to melt the world and mould it new again 
it be in vain to spend it in these mood 

I not observe this throng round till now 
gracious and kind spectator you be welcome 
Apollo and the muse feast your eye 
with graceful object and may our Minerva 
answer your hope unto their large strain 
yet here mistake i not judicious friend 
I do not this to beg your patience 
or servile to fawn on your applause 
like some dry brain despair in his merit 
let i be censure by the austere brow 
where I want art or judgement tax i free 
let envious critic with their broad eye 
look through and through i I pursue no favour 
only vouchsafe i your attention 
and I will give you music worth your ear 
o how I hate the monstrousness of time 
where every servile imitate spirit 
plague with a itch leprosy of wit 
in a mere halt fury strive to fling 
his ulcerous body in the thespian spring 
and straight leap forth a poet but as lame 
as Vulcan or the founder of Cripplegate 

in faith this humour will come ill to some 
you will be think to be too peremptory 

this humour good and why this humour mitis 
nay do not turn but answer 

answer what 

I will not stir your patience pardon i 
I urge it for some reason and the rather 
to give these ignorant wellspoken day 
some taste of their abuse of this word humour 

o do not let your purpose fall good asper 
it can but arrive most acceptable 
chief to such as have the happiness 
daily to see how the poor innocent word 
be rack and torture 

I I pray you proceed 

ha what what be it 

for the abuse of humour 

o I crave pardon I have lose my thought 
why humour as it be ens we thus define it 
to be a quality of air or water 
and in itself hold these two property 
moisture and fluxure as for demonstration 
pour water on this floor it will wet and run 
likewise the air force through a horn or trumpet 
flow instant away and leave behind 
a kind of dew and hence we do conclude 
that whatsoever have fluxure and humidity 
as want power to contain itself 
be humour so in every humane body 
the choler melancholy phlegm and blood 
by reason that they flow continual 
in some one part and be not continent 
receive the name of humour now thus far 
it may by metaphor apply itself 
unto the general disposition 
as when some one peculiar quality 
do so possess a man that it do draw 
all his affect his spirit and his power 
in their confluction all to run one way 
this may be true say to be a humour 
but that a rook in wear a pied feather 
the cable hatband or the threepiled ruff 
a yard of shoetie or the Swisser knot 
on his french garter shall affect a humour 
oh it be more than most ridiculous 

he speak pure truth now if a idiot 
have but a apish or fantastic strain 
it be his humour 

well I will scourge those ape 
and to these courteous eye oppose a mirror 
as large as be the stage whereon we act 
where they shall see the time deformity 
anatomize in every nerve and sinew 
with constant courage and contempt of fear 

Asper I urge it as your friend take heed 
the day be dangerous full of exception 
and man be grow impatient of reproof 

ha ha 
you may as well have tell i yonder be heaven 
this earth these man and all have move alike 
do not I know the time condition 
yes mitis and their soul and who they be 
that either will or can except against i 
none but a sort of fool so sick in taste 
that they contemn all physic of the mind 
and like gall camel kick at every touch 
good man and virtuous spirit that loathe their vice 
will cherish my free labour love my line 
and with the fervour of their shine grace 
make my brain fruitful to bring forth more object 
worthy their serious and intentive eye 
but why enforce I this as faint no 
if any here chance to behold himself 
let he not dare to challenge i of wrong 
for if he shame to have his folly know 
first he shall shame to act they my strict hand 
be make to cease on vice and with a gripe 
crush out the humour of such spongy soul 
as lick up every idle vanity 

why this be right furor poeticus 
kind gentleman we hope your patience 
will yet conceive the best or entertain 
this supposition that a madman speak 

what be you ready there mitis sit down 
and my cordatus sound ho and begin 
I leave you two as censor to sit here 
observe what I present and liberal 
speak your opinion upon every scene 
as it shall pass the view of these spectator 
nay now you be tedious sir for shame begin 
and mitis note i if in all this front 
you can espy a gallant of this mark 
who to be think one of the judicious 
sit with his arm thus wreathe his hat pull here 
cry meaw and nod then shake his empty head 
will show more several motion in his face 
than the new London Rome or Nineveh 
and now and then break a dry biscuit jest 
which that it may more easy be chew 
he steep in his own laughter 

why will that 
make it be soon swallow 

o assure you 
or if it do not yet as Horace sing 
jeiunus rar stomachus vulgaria temnit 
mean cate be welcome still to hungry guest 

it be true but why shall we observe they asper 

o I will know they for in such assembly 

nay asper 

peace mitis I do know your thought 
you will say your audience will except at this 
pish you be too timorous and full of doubt 
then he a patient shall reject all physic 
because the physician tell he you be sick 
or if I say that he be vicious 
you will not hear of virtue come you be fond 
shall I be so extravagant to think 
that happy judgement and compose spirit 
will challenge i for tax such as these 
I be ashamed 

nay but good pardon we 
we must not bear this peremptory sail 
but use our best endeavour how to please 

why therein I commend your careful thought 
and I will mix with you in industry 
to please but who attentive auditor 
such as will join their profit with their pleasure 
and come to feed their understanding part 
for these I will prodigal spend myself 
and speak away my spirit into air 
for these I will melt my brain into invention 
coin new conceit and hang my rich word 
as polish jewel in their bounteous ear 
but stay I lose myself and wrong their patience 
if I dwell here they will not begin I see 
friend sit you still and entertain this troop 
with some familiar and byconference 
I will haste they sound now gentleman I go 
to turn a actor and a humorist 
where ere I do resume my present person 
we hope to make the circle of your eye 
flow with distil laughter if we fail 
we must impute it to this only chance 
be have a enemy call ignorance 

how do you like his spirit mitis 

I shall like it much better if he be less confident 

why do you suspect his merit 

no but I fear this will procure he much envy 

o that set the strong seal on his desert if he have no enemy I shall esteem his fortune most wretched at this instant 

you have see his play cordatus pray you how be it 

faith sir I must refrain to judge only this I can say of it it be strange and of a particular kind by itself somewhat like vetus comoedia a work that have bounteous please i how it will answer the general expectation I know not 

do he observe all the law of comedy in it 

what law mean you 

why the equal division of it into act and scene accord to the terentian manner his true number of actor the furnish of the scene with Grex or chorus and that the whole argument fall within compass of a day efficiency 

o no these be too nice observation 

they be such as must be receive by your favour or it can be authentic 

troth I can discern no such necessity 

no 

no I assure you signior if those law you speak of have be deliver we ab initio and in their present virtue and perfection there have be some reason of obey their power but it be extant that that which we call comoedia be at first nothing but a simple and continue satire sing by one only person till Susario invent a second after he Epicharmus a three Phormus and Chionides devise to have four actor with a prologue and chorus to which Cratinus long after add a five and sixth Eupolis more Aristophanes more than they every man in the dignity of his spirit and judgement supply something and though that in he this kind of poem appear absolute and full perfect yet how be the face of it change since in Menander Philemon Cecilius Plautus and the rest who have utter exclude the chorus alter the property of the person their name and nature and augment it with all liberty accord to the elegancy and disposition of those time wherein they write I see not then but we shall enjoy the same licentia or free power to illustrate and heighten our invention as they do and not be tie to those strict and regular form which the niceness of a few who be nothing but form will thrust upon we 

well we will not dispute of this now but what be his scene 

marry insula fortunata sir 

o the fortunate island mass he have bind himself to a strict law there 

why so 

he can light alter the scene without cross the sea 

he need not have a whole island to run through I think 

no how come it then that in some one play we see so many sea country and kingdom pass over with such admirable dexterity 

o that but show how well the author can travail in their vocation and outrun the apprehension of their auditory but leave this I will they will begin once this protraction be able to sour the bestsettled patience in the theatre

what may this fellow be cordatus 

faith if the time will suffer his description I will give it you he be one the author call he Carlo Buffone a impudent common jester a violent railer and a incomprehensible epicure one who company be desire of all man but belove of none he will soon lose his soul than a jest and profane even the most holy thing to excite laughter no honourable or reverend personage whatsoever can come within the reach of his eye but be turn into all manner of variety by his adulterate simile 

you paint forth a monster 

he will prefer all country before his native and think he can never sufficient or with admiration enough deliver his affectionate conceit of foreign atheistical policy but stay observe these he will appear himself anon 

o this be your envious man Macilente I think 

the same sir 

viri est fortunae caecitatem facile far 
it be true but stoic where in the vast world 
do that man breath that can so much command 
his blood and his affection well I see 
I strive in vain to cure my wound soul 
for every cordial that my thought apply 
turn to a corrosive and do eat it far 
there be no taste in this philosophy 
it be like a potion that a man shall drink 
but turn his stomach with the sight of it 
I be no such pile cynic to believe 
that beggary be the only happiness 
or with a number of these patient fool 
to sing my mind to i a kingdom be 
when the lank hungry belly bark for food 
I look into the world and there I meet 
with object that do strike my bloodshot eye 
into my brain where when I view myself 
have before observe this man be great 
mighty and fear that love and high favour 
a three think wise and learned a four rich 
and therefore honour a five rare feature 
a six admire for his nuptial fortune 
when I see these I say and view myself 
I wish my optic instrument be crack 
and that the engine of my grief can cast 
my eyeball like two globe of wildfire forth 
to melt this unproportioned frame of nature 
o they be thought that have transfix my heart 
and often in the strength of apprehension 
make my cold passion stand upon my face 
like drop of sweat on a stiff cake of ice 

This allude well to that of the poet 
inuidus suspirat gemit incutitque dentes 
sudat frigidus intuens quod odit

nor earth to hide it in I will bring it but till then 
each corn I send shall be as big as Paul 
o but say some the poor be like to starve 
why let they starve what be that to i be bee 
bind to keep life in drone and idle moth no 
why such be these that term themselves the poor 
only because they will be pity 
but be indeed a sort of lazy beggar 
licentious rogue and sturdy vagabond 
breed by the sloth of a fat plenteous year 
like snake in heat of summer out of dung 
and this be all that these cheap time be good for 
whereas a wholesome and penurious dearth 
purge the soil of such vile excrement 
and kill the viper up 

o but master 
take heed they hear you not 

why so 

they will exclaim against you 

ay their exclaim 
move i as much as thy breath move a mountain 
poor worm they hiss at i while I at home 
can be content to applaud myself 
to sit and clap my hand and laugh and leap 
knock my head against my roof with joy 
to see how plump my bag be and my barn 
sirrah go hie you home and bid your fellow 
get all their flail ready again I come 

I will sir 

I will instant set all my hind to thrash 
of a whole reek of corn which I will hide 
under the ground and with the straw thereof 
I will stuff the outside of my other mowes 
that do I will have they empty all my garner 
and in the friendly earth bury my store 
that when the searcher come they may suppose 
all be spend and that my fortune be belie 
and to lend more opinion to my want 
and stop that manymouthed vulgar dog 
which else will still be bay at my door 
each market day I will be see to buy 
part of the pure wheat as for my household 
where when it come it shall increase my heap 
it will yield i treble gain at this dear time 
promise in this dear book I have cast all 
till then I will not sell a care I will hang first 
o I shall make my prize as I list 
my house and I can feed on pease and barley 
what though a world of wretch starve the while 
he that will thrive must think no course vile 

now signior how approve you this have the humorist express themselves true or no 

yes if it be well prosecute it be hitherto happy enough but methinks Macilente go hence too soon he may have be make to stay and speak somewhat in reproof of Sordido wretchedness now at the last 

o no that have be extreme improper beside he have continue the scene too long with he as it be be in no more action 

you may enforce the length as a necessary reason but for propriety the scene will very well have bear it in my judgement 

o worst of both why you mistake his humour utter then 

how do I mistake it be it not envy 

yes but you must understand signior he envy he not as he be a villain a wolf in the commonwealth but as he be rich and fortunate for the true condition of envy be dolour alienae felicitatis to have our eye continual fix upon another man prosperity that be his chief happiness and to grieve at that where as if we make his monstrous and abhor action our object the grief we take then come near the nature of hate than envy as be breed out of a kind of contempt and loathe in ourselves 

so you will infer it have be hate not envy in he to reprehend the humour of Sordido 

right for what a man true envy in another he can always love and cherish in himself but no man true reprehend in another what he love in himself therefore reprehension be out of his hate and this distinction have he himself make in a speech there if you mark it where he say I envy not this buffoon but I hate he 

stay sir I envy not this buffoon but I hate he why may he not as well have hate Sordido as he 

no sir there be subject for his envy in Sordido his wealth so be there not in the other he stand possess of no one eminent gift but a most odious and fiendlike disposition that will turn charity itself into hate much more envy for the present

true as his subject lie but he may have alter the shape of argument and explicate they better in single scene 

that have be single indeed why be they not the same person in this as they will have be in those and be it not a object of more state to behold the scene full and relieve with variety of speaker to the end than to see a vast empty stage and the actor come in one by one as if they be drop down with a feather into the eye of the audience 

nay you be better trade with these thing than I and therefore I will subscribe to your judgement marry you shall give i leave to make objection

shall fawn upon this fellow more than i 
I be a man and I have limb flesh blood 
bone sinew and a soul as well as he 
my part be every way as good as he 
if I say better why I do not lie 
natheless his wealth but nod on my want 
must make i bow and cry I thank you sir

what mean this signior Deliro 

cast in more frankincense yet more well say 
o Macilente I have such a wife 
so pass fair so pass fair unkind 
and of such worth and right to be unkind 
since no man can be worthy of her kindness 

what can there not 

no that be sure as death 
no man alive I do not say be not 
but can possible be worth her kindness 
nay that be certain let i do she right 
how say I do her right as though I can 
as though this dull gross tongue of i can utter 
the rare the true the pure the infinite right 
that sit as high as I can look within she 

this be such dotage as be never hear 

well this must needs be grant 

grant quoth you 

nay Macilente do not so discredit 
the goodness of your judgement to deny it 
for I do speak the very least of she 
and I will crave and beg no more of heaven 
for all my fortune here but to be able 
to utter first in fit term what she be 
and then the true joy I conceive in she 

be it possible she shall deserve so well 
as you pretend 

ay and she know so well 
her own desert that when I strive to enjoy they 
she way the thing I do with what she merit 
and see my worth outweigh so in her grace 
she be so solemn so precise so froward 
that no observance I can do to she 
can make her kind to i if she find fault 
I mend that fault and then she say I fault 
that I do mend it now good friend advise i 
how I may temper this strange spleen in she 

you be too amorous too obsequious 
and make she too assure she may command you 
when woman doubt most of their husband love 
they be most love husband must take heed 
they give no glut of kindness to their wife

you say well but I will fain hear one of these autumn judgement define once quid sit comoedia if he can let he content himself with Cicero definition till he have strength to propose to himself a better who will have a comedy to be imitatio vitae speculum consuetudinis imago veritatis a thing throughout pleasant and ridiculous and accommodate to the correction of manner if the maker have fail in any particle of this they may worthy tax he but if not why be you that be for they silent as I will be for he and give way to the actor 

nay godsprecious if the weather and the season be so respectless that beggar shall live as well as their better and that my hunger and thirst for riches shall not make they hunger and thirst with poverty that my sleep shall be break and their heart not break that my coffer shall be full and yet care they empty and yet merry it be time that a cross shall bear flesh and blood since flesh and blood can bear this cross
