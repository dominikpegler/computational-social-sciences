yes now I do but what after become of the poor infant 

why in the night we send they abroad and lay one at this man door and another at that such as be able to keep they and what after become of they we inquire not and this be another string to my bow 

most strange that woman brain shall apprehend 
such law less indirect and horrid mean

woman and man be free of which they never 
have charter for but mistress be you so 
cunning as you make yourself you can 
neither write nor read what do you with hose 
book you so often turn over 

why tell the leaf for to be ignorant and seem ignorant what great folly 

believe i this be a cunning woman neither have she she name for nothing who out of her ignorance can fool so many that think themselves wise but wherefore have you build this little closet close to the door where sit you may hear every word speak by all such as ask for you 

true and therefore I build it if any knock you must to the door and question they to find what they come about if to this purpose or to that now they ignorant tell thou their errand which I sit in my closet over hear present come forth and tell they the cause of their come with every word that have pass betwixt you in private which they admire and think it to be miraculous by their report I become thus famous 

this be no trade but a mystery and be I a wisewoman as indeed I be but a foolish boy I need not live by your service but mistress we lose ourselves in this discourse be not this the morning in which I shall be marry

that gallant wench if my grannam fable not 
shall be luce but what be those other

but who be they 

a lord and lady shall sir Boniface stay 
rather than so strive who shall lead the way 

now jack my boy keep thy own counsel and countenance and I shall cry quittance with my young gallant well by this time sir Boniface be at his book but because there be a mistake know only to my boy and myself the marriage shall be no soon end but I will disturb they by some sudden outcry and that too before they have leisure to unmask and make know themselves one to another for if the deceit be know I shall fall into the danger of that young mad rascal and now this double apprehension of the lord and the lady shall fetch i off from all I know it be sir Boniface his custom to make short work and have dispatch by this and now wisewoman try if thou can bestir thyself like to a madwoman shift for yourselves warrant and pursuivant away warrant and pursuivant shift for yourselves
