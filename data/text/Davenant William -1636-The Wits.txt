and then the evening warrant you they spend 
with mother spectacle the curate wife 
who do inveigh against curl and die cheek 
heave her devout impatient nose at oil 
of jessamin and think powder of Paris more 
profane than the ash of a romish martyr 

and in the day of joy and triumph sir 
which come as seldom to they as new gown 
then humble wretch they do frisk and dance 
in narrow parlour to a single fiddle 
that squeak forth tune like a depart pig 

while the mad hind shake from their foot more dirt 
than do the cedarroot that dance to Orpheus 

do they not pour their wine too from a ewer 
or small guilt cruse like orangewater keep 
to sprinkle holiday beard 

and when a stranger come send seven mile post 
by moonshine for another pint

perhaps for the church perhaps for hospital 

if rich you come to court there learn to be 
at charge to teach your paraqueeto french 
and then allow they their interpreter 
lest the sage fowl shall lose their wisdom on 
such page of the presence and the guard 
as have not pass the sea

like wanton monkey chain from fruit 
you feed upon the itch of your own tail 

rosevinegar to wash that ruffian mouth
