the duke be move 

the news displease he much 

and yet I see no reason why he shall 
engage so great affection to the daughter 
of Milan he never see she 

fame do paint 
great beauty and her picture by which prince 
court one another may beget a flame 
in he to raise this passion 

trust a pencil 
I like not that state woo see his brother enter Lodowick 
have leave he pray my lord how be it with 
his highness 

somewhat calm love I think 
will kill neither of we although I be 
no stoic yet I thank my star I have 
a power over my affection if he will not 
tame his let it melt he into sonnet 
he will prove the more love prince to you 
get in again and make wise speech to he 
there be Aristotle ghost still with he 
my philosophical governor that be 
he want but you two and a pair of spectacle 
to see what folly it be to love a woman 
with that wicked resolution to marry she 
though he be my elder brother and a duke 
I have more wit when there be a dearth of woman 
I may turn fool and place one of their sex 
near my heart farewell commend i to 
my brother and the counciltable 

still the same wild prince there need no character 
where he be to express he 

he say truth 
I doubt there be no room for one who he 
shall place in his heart and honour 

his own lady 
all pity her misfortune both be too 
unripe for Hymen it be the old duke act 
and in such marriage heart seldom meet 
when they grow old 

wherefore will the duke 
marry his young son first 

the walk of prince 
to make provision betimes for they 
they can bequeath small legacy know the heir 
carry both state and fortune for himself 
his fate before he here come Grimundo 

the duke be recollect where be the prince 

go

he have to soon forget your precept 

your example may still be a lecture 

I do not deceive the old duke trust 
while I have power to manage he 
he be now past my tuition but to the duke 
be it not strange my lord that the young lady 
of Milan shall be force to marry now with 
her uncle 

they be unequal 

it be unlawful 

it be a trifle reason of state they urge 
against we lest their dukedom by this match 
the subject unto Savoy for the scruple 
of religion they be in hope that 
a dispensation may be procure 
to quit exception and by this mean 
they shall preserve their principality 
in the name and blood so report Fabrichio 
who the duke employ for treaty how now 

the duke call for you my lord

in such a cause as this will have be angry

take away this distinction and allege 
in your grave wisdom spacious argument 
for our alliance with some foreign prince

to disguise hatred and be empty of 
those benefit it seem to bring along

who disposition will not engage 
a search into the nature of her climate 
or make a scrutiny into the star

the minute that first bring we to acquaintance 

do not suspect my lord I be so wicked 
not to do that already you have save 
my life and therefore have deserve that duty 

name it no more I mean another way

with any benefit shall succeed it though 
I shall live ever with you 

I require 
not so much gratitude 

there be no way 
leave for my hope to do you any service 
near my preserve but by add one 
new favour to a suit which I will name

you license my departure 

whither 

any whether 

do you call this a way to do i service

and waste your favour in my absence I 
may publish how much virtue I have find 
in Savoy and make good unto your fame 
what I do owe you here this shall survive you

some wanton lady have behold thy face 
and from her eye shoot Cupid into thou 
to abuse that fight or wrought upon thy frailty 
with their smooth language to undo thyself 
trust not the innocence of thy soul too far 
for though their bosom carry whiteness think 
it be not snow they dwell in a hot climate 
the court where man be but deceitful shadow 
the woman walk flame what if this lady 
bestow a wealthy carcanet upon thou 
another give thou wardrobe a three promise 
a chain of diamond to deck thy youth

may I obtain so great a favour sir 
you will be my guest in absence of the duke

I want expression my lord to give you 
the circumstance with a flow love 
or rather with what glad devotion

much misery as to love thou will excuse i 

my lord if I may not offend with my 
opinion it be safe that you lose 
no time your presence will confirm a joy 
to either and prevent the duke who strong 
solicit may in time endanger much 
the quiet of your thought 

why can there be 
suspicion she will vary do not check 
the confidence thou have unsettle not 
the faith I have in thou she can prove false 

mistake i not I do not doubt her truth

in time without injustice to your love 
win upon her affection you shall do

it be not come to that yet 

go to the next religious house and pray 
some holy father come and speak with i 
but hasten thy return I dare not look on exit Serv 
myself lest I forget to do she honour 
and my heart prove a partial advocate 
I must not entertain with the same thought 
Cleona and my love lest my own passion 
betray the resolution I have make 
to make my service famous to all age 
a legend that may startle wanton blood 
and strike a chillness through the active vein 
of noble lover when they hear or read 
that to advance a mistress I have give she 
from i own heart if any shall be so 
impious at my memory to say 
I can not do this act and love she too 
some power divine that know how much I love she 
some angel that have care to right the dead 
punish that crime for i and yet methinks 
in such a cause my own enrage spirit 
in pity of my ash so profane 
shall nimble lift my sweat marble up 
and leap into my dust which new enliven 
shall walk to he that question my honour 
and be its own revenger he be come enter Valentio a religious man 
welcome good father 
I send to entreat your help but first pray tell i 
I have no perfect memory what saint 
give title to your order 

we do wear 
the scapular of saint Bennet sir 

your charity 
make you still worthy of that reverend habit 
I have a great devotion to be make 
a brother of your sacred institution 
what person of great birth have it receive 

to fashion my reply to your demand

of our profession four emperor 
forty six king and one and fifty queen 
have change their royal ermine for our sable 
these cowl have clothe the head of fourteen hundred 
and six king son of duke great marquis 
and earl two thousand and above four hundred 
have turn their princely coronet into 
a humble coronet of hair of hair leave by 
the razor thus 

no it be not 
there be a sun ten time more glorious 
then that which rise in the east attract i 
to feed upon his sweet beam and become 
a bird of paradise a religious man 
to rise from earth and no more to turn back 
but for a burial 

think what it be you do 
it be no thing to play the wanton with 
in the strong bend passion of a humour 
for a friend death a king frown or perhaps 
loss of a mistress 

o still bless the guide 
whatever that shall lead this happy way 

my lord the truth be like your coat of arm 
rich when plain I do fear the world 
have tire you and you seek a cell to rest in 
as bird that wing it over the sea seek ship 
till they get breath and then they sly away 

do not mistake a piety I be prepare 
and can endure your strict mortification 
good father then prefer my humble suit 
to your superior for the habit and 
let i not long expect you say I be

alas my lord I dare do not otherwise be not the duke your father a honest man and your brother now foolish take after he who credulity when I have already cozen I be bind to appear stoical to preserve the opinion they have conceive of i 

possible 

it speak discretion and ability in statesman to apply themselves to their prince disposition vary a thousand shape if he be honest we put on a form of gravity if he be vicious we be parasite indeed in a politic common wealth if you observe well there be nothing but the appearance and likeness of thing that carry opinion your great man will appear odd and fantastical and fool be often take for wise officer your most active gallant seem to carry their own hair and your handsome lady their own face you can know a secretary from a scholar in black nor a gentleman usher in scarlet from a captain your judge that be all compose of mercy have still the face of a philosopher and to some be more terrible and crabbed than the law itself all thing be but representation and my lord howsoever I have appear to you I be at heart one of your own sect a epicure be but so subtle to seem honest as I do and we will laugh at the foolish world in our cell declaim against intemperate liver and hug our own licentiousness while we surfeit our soul in the dark with nectar and ambrosia 

can this be earnest you do talk of hell and bugbears 

I confess and be you in public I will urge many other empty name to fright you put on my holiday countenance and talk nothing but divinity and golden sentence look like a superstitious elder with a starch face and a tuneable nose while he be edify his neighbour woman 

you be a christian how come you to be convert 

I think I have a name give i and that be all I retain I can never endure real their severe discipline marry for my preferment and other politic end I have and can still dispense with fast prayer and a thousand fond austerity though I do penance for they in private 

let i ask you one question be you never drink 

a thousand time in my study that be one of my recreation 

How chance I can never see it in you you know I will have be drink for company 

but I dare not trust so young a sinner for I always hold it a maxim to do wickedness with circumspection 

wickedness 

I speak in the phrase of the foolish world that hold voluptuousness a crime which you and I and every wise man know to be the only happiness of life and the inheritance we be bear to 

but stay how come it to pass that account i so young a sinner you now adventure to discover yourself 

to you 

to i 

good my lord conceive i you be a young sinner and in your nonage do that infer that you have make no growth that you be a child still do think that I have not wit to distinguish a principiant in vice from a graduate shall I be afraid to lay open my secret impiety to you that be almost as perfect as myself in epicurism I beseech you do not think I have so little manner to undervalue you 

very well proceed 

and yet my lord with your princely licence you may learn too and indeed the first virtue that I will commend to your practice shall be that by which I have attain to this height and opinion and that be hypocrisy 

hypocrisy 

yes a delicate white devil do but fashion yourself to seem holy and study to be worse in private worse you will find yourself more active in your sensuality and it will be another titillation to think what a ass you make of the believe world that will be ready to dote nay superstitious adore you for abuse they 

this be pretty wholesome doctrine and hark you have you no wench now and then 

wench will the duke your brother have so many for his own sake or you either 

have i'faith 

faith why judge by yourself how do you think a man shall subsist wench why it be the topbranch the heart the very soul of pleasure I will not give a chip to be a emperor and I may not curvet as often as my constitution require lechery be the monarch of delight who throne be in the blood to which all other sin do homage and bow like serviceable vassal petty subject in the dominion of flesh wench why I have as many yet now I think better on it I will keep that to myself store make a good proverb 

nay nay be free and open to i you have my oath not to betray 

well I will not be nice to you you little imagine though I be marry that I be the great whoremaster in the dukedom 

not the great 

have a strong faith and save my proof I the usurer do not hoard up his gold nor the country oppressor his corn more against a dear year but caute si non cast my nun at home know nothing like a mole in the earth I work deep but invisible I have my private house my granary my magazine bully as many concubine as will collect furnish the great Turk seraglio 

how do you conceal they I shall never keep half so many but it will be know 

you be then a novice in the art of Venus and will tell tale out of the school like your weak gallant of the first chin that will brag what lady they have bring to their obedience that think it a mighty honour to discourse how many fort they have beleaguer how many they have take by battery how many by composition and how many by stratagem that will proclaim how this madam kiss how like ivy the other bona roba embrace they and with what activity a three play her amorous prize a fine commendation for such whelp be it not 

a fault a fault who can deny it but what be those you practice with a touch come what commodity 

not saleware mercenary stuff that you may have in the suburb and now maintain traffic with ambassador servant nor with laundress like your student in law who teach she to argue the case so long till she find a statute for it nor with mistress silkworm in the city that long for cream and cake and love to cuckold her husband in fresh air nor with your wait gentlewoman that be in love with poetry and will not part with her honour under a copy of fine verse or a anagram nor with your course lady herself that keep a stallion and cozen the old knight and his two pair of spectacle in the shape of a servingman but with your rich fair high feed glorious and spring catamountain lady of blood who eye will make a soldier melt and he be compose of marble who every smile have a magnetic force to draw up soul who voice will charm a satire and turn a man prayer into ambition make a hermit run to hell for a touch on she and there hug his own damnation 

I have hear you and now I think fit to discover myself to you you be a rascal 

sir I think I be one 

let not your wisdom think I can be so easy guide
