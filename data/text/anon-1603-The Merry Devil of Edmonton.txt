what mean the toll of this fatal chime 
oh what a tremble horror strike my heart 
my stiffen hair stand upright on my head 
as do the bristle of a porcupine 

Fabel awake or I will bear thou hence headlong to hell 

ha ha why do thou wake i 
Coreb be it thou

I know thou well I hear the watchful dog 
with hollow howl tell of thy approach 
the light burn dim affright with thy presence 
and this distemper and tempestuous night 
tell i the air be trouble with some devil 

Come be thou ready 

whither or to what 

why scholar this the hour my date expire 
I must depart and come to claim my due 

hah what be thy due 

Fabel thyself 

o let not darkness hear thou speak that word 
lest that with force it hurry hence amain 
and leave the world to look upon my woe 
yet overwhelm i with this globe of earth 
and let a little sparrow with her bill 
take but so much as she can bear away 
that every day thus lose of my load 
I may again in time yet hope to rise

and draw the formal deed betwixt thou and i

o that this soul that cost so great a price 
as the dear precious blood of her redeemer 
inspire with knowledge shall by that alone 
which make a man so mean unto the power 
even lead he down into the depth of hell 
when man in their own pride strive to know more than man shall know 
for this alone God cast the angel down 
the infinity of art be like a sea 
into which when man will take in hand to sail 
further than reason which shall be his pilot 
have skill to guide he lose once his compass 
he fall to such deep and dangerous whirlpool 
as he do lose the very sight of heaven 
the more he strive to come to quiet harbour 
the further still he find himself from land 
man strive still to find the depth of evil 
seek to be a God become a devil

and after all these promise by Clare 
refuse to give his daughter to thy son 
only because thy revenue can reach 
to make her dowager of so rich a jointure 
as can the heir of wealthy jerningham 
and therefore be the false fox now in hand 
to strike a match betwixt she and the other 
and the old graybeard now be close together

Raymond Mounchensey boy have thou and I 
thus long at Cambridge read the liberal art 
the metaphysic magic and those part

and come we back unto our native home 
for want of skill to lose the wench thou love 
we will first hang Enfield in such ring of mist 
as never rise from any dampish fen 
I will make the brine sea to rise at ware 
and drown the marsh unto Stratford bridge 
I will drive the deer from Waltham in their walk 
and scatter they like sheep in every field

but here come Raymond disconsolate and sad 
and here be the gallant that must have the wench 
I prithee Raymond leave these solemn dump 
revive thy spirit thou that before have be

as mirth herself

have speak that word it will have come as cold 
as the bleak northern wind upon the face 
of winter 
from thou they have some power upon my blood 
yet be from thou have but that hollow sound 
come from the lip of any live man 
it may have win the credit of my ear 
from thou it can 

if I understand thou I be a villain 
what do thou speak in parable to thy friend 

Come boy and make i this same groan love 
trouble with stitch and the cough of the lung 
that weep his eye out when he be a child 
and ever since have shoot at hoodmanblind

Raymond Mounchensey now I touch thy grief 
with the true feel of a zealous friend 
and as for fair and beauteous Millicent 
with my vain breath I will not seek to slubber 
her angel like perfection but thou know 
that Essex have the saint that I adore 
where ere do we meet thou and wanton spring 
that like a wag thou have not laugh at i 
and with regardless jest mock my love 
now many a sad and weary summer night 
my sigh have drink the dew from off the earth 
I have teach the watchful nightingale to wake 
and from the meadow spring the early lark 
a hour before she will have rise to sing 
I have load the poor minute with my moan 
that I have make the heavy slow pace hour 
to hang like heavy clog upon the day 
but dear Mounchensey have not my affection 
seize on the beauty of another dame 
before I will give over the chase and wrong the love 
of one so worthy and so true a friend 
I will abjure both beauty and her sight 
and will in love become a counterfeit 

dear jerningham thou have beget my life 
and from the mouth of he I where now I sit 
I feel my spirit rebound against the star 
thou have conquer i dear friend in my free soul 
their time or death can by their power control 

Frank jerningham thou be a gallant boy 
and be he not my pupil I will say 
he be as fine a mettle gentleman 
of as free spirit and of as fine a temper 
as be in England and he be a man 
that very rich may deserve thy love 
but noble Clare this while of our discourse 
what may Mounchensey honour to thyself 
exact upon the measure of thy grace 

Raymond Mounchensey I will have thou know 
he do not breathe this air 
who love I cherish and who soul I love 
more than Mounchensey 
nor ever in my life do see the man 
who for his wit and many virtuous part 
I think more worthy of my sister love 
but since the matter grow unto this pass 
I must not seem to cross my father will 
but when thou list to visit she by night 
my horse saddle and the stable door 
stand ready for thou use they at thy pleasure 
in honest marriage wed she frank boy 
and if thou get her lad God give thou joy 

then care away let fate my fall pretend 
back with the favour of so true a friend 

let we alone to bustle for the set 
for age and craft with wit and art have meet 
I will make my spirit to dance such nightly jig 
along the way betwixt this and Tottenham cross 
the carrier jade shall cast their heavy pack 
and the strong hedge scarce shall keep they in 
the milkmaid cut shall turn the wench off 
and lay the dosser tumble in the dust 
the frank and merry London prentice 
that come for cream and lusty country cheer 
shall lose their way and scramble in the ditch 
all night shall whoop and hollow cry and call 
yet none to other find the way at all

to cause a recluse to remove her vow 
a maim contrite and repentant soul

who thought even as her eye be fix on heaven 
to draw a virgin thus devour with zeal 
back to the world o impious deed 
nor by the canon law can it be do 
without a dispensation from the church

as she will even shriek to hear a husband name 

i a poor innocent she well here be no knavery he flout the old fool to their tooth 

boy I be glad to hear 
thou make such scruple of that conscience 
and in a man so young as be yourself 
I promise you it be very seldom see 
but Frank this be a trick a mere devise 
a sleight plot betwixt her father and myself 
to thrust Mounchensey nose beside the cushion 
that be thus debar of all access 
time yet may work he from her thought 
and give thou ample scope to thy desire 

a plague on you both for a couple of jew 

how now Frank what say you to that 

let i alone I warrant thou 
sir assure that this motion do proceed 
from your most kind and fatherly affection 
I do dispose my like to your pleasure 
but for it be a matter of such moment 
as holy marriage I must crave thus much 
to have some conference with my ghostly father 
friar Hildersham here by at Waltham Abby 
to be absolve of thing that it be fit 
none only but my confessor shall know
