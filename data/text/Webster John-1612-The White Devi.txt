what be those two 
that bear he company 

two nobleman of Hungary that live in the emperor service as commander eight year since contrary to the expectation of all the court enter into religion into the strict order of Capuchin but be not well settle in their undertake they leave their order and return to court for which be after trouble in conscience they vow their service against the enemy of Christ go to Malta be there knight and in their return back at this great solemnity they be resolve for ever to forsake the world and settle themselves here in a house of Capuchin in Padua 

it be strange 

one thing make it so they have vow for ever to wear next their bare body those coat of mail they serve in 

hard penance 
be the moor a christian 

he be 

why proffer he his service to our duke 

because he understand there be like to grow 
some war between we and the duke of Florence 
in which he hope employment 
I never see one in a stern bold look 
wear more command nor in a lofty phrase 
express more know or more deep contempt 
of our slight airy courtier he talk 
as if he have travail all the prince court 
of Christendom in all thing strive to express 
that all that shall dispute with he may know 
glory like glowworm afar off shine bright 
but look to near have neither heat nor light 
the duke 

you be noble welcome we have hear at full 
your honourable service against the Turk 
to you brave Mulinassar we assign 
a competent pension and be inly sorrow 
the vow of those two worthy gentleman 
make they incapable of our proffer bounty 
your wish be you may leave your warlike sword 
for monument i in our chapel I accept it 
as a great honour do i and must crave 
your leave to furnish out our duchess revel 
only one thing as the last vanity 
you ere shall view deny i not to stay 
to see a barrier prepare tonight 
you shall have private stand it have please 
the great ambassador of several prince 
in their return from Rome to their own country 
to grace our marriage and to honour i 
with such a kind of sport 

I shall persuade they 
to stay my lord 
set on there to the presence 

noble my lord most fortunate welcome 
you have our vow seal with the sacrament 
to second your attempt 

and all thing ready 
he can not have invent his own ruin 
have he despair with more propriety 

you will not take my way 

it be better order 

to have poison his prayer book or a pair of bead 
the pummel of his saddle his lookingglass 
or the handle of his racket o that that 
that while he have be bandy at tennis 
he may have swear himself to hell and strike 
his soul into the hazard o my lord 
I will have our plot be ingenious 
and have it hereafter record for example 
rather than borrow example 

there be no way 
more speed than this think on 

on then 

and yet methinks that this revenge be poor 
because it steal upon he like a thief 
to have take he by the cask in a pitch field 
lead he to Florence 

it have be rare and there 
have crown he with a wreath of stink garlic 
to have show the sharpness of his government 
and rankness of his lust 
Flamineo come 

why do this devil haunt you say 

I know not 
for by this light I do not conjure for she 
it be not so great a cunning as man think 
to raise the devil for here be one up already 
the great cunning be to lay he down 

Shee be your shame 

I prithee pardon she 
in faith you see woman be like to burr 
where their affection throw they there they will stick 

that be my countryman a goodly person 
when he be at leisure I will discourse with he 
in our own language 

I beseech you do 
how be that brave soldier o that I have see 
some of your iron day I pray relate 
some of your service to we 

it be a ridiculous thing for a man to be his own chronicle I do never wash my mouth with my own praise for fear of get a stink breath 

you be too stoical the duke will expect other discourse from you 

I shall never flatter he I have study man too much to do that what difference be between the duke and I no more than between two brick all make of one clay only it may be one be place on the top of a turret the other in the bottom of a well by mere chance if I be place as high as the duke I shall stick as fast make as fair a show and bear out weather equal 

if this soldier have a patent to beg in church than he will tell they story 

I have be a soldier too 

how have you thrive 

faith poor 

that be the misery of peace only outside be then respect as ship seem very great upon the river which show very little upon the sea so some man in the court seem colossus in a chamber who if they come into the field will appear pitiful pigmy 

give i a fair room yet hang with arras and some great cardinal to lug i by the ear as his endear minion 

and thou may do the devil know what villainy 

and safe 

right you shall see in the country in harvest time pigeon though they destroy never so much corn the farmer dare not present the fowl piece to they why because they belong to the lord of the manor while your poor sparrow that belong to the lord of heaven they go to the pot for it 

I will now give you some politic instruction the duke say he will give you pension that be but bare promise get it under his hand for I have know man that have come from serve against the Turk for three or four month they have have pension to buy they new wooden leg and fresh plaster but after it be not to be have and this miserable courtesy show as if a tormenter shall give hot cordial drink to one three quarter dead of the rack only to fetch the miserable soul again to endure more dogday 
how now gallant what be they ready for the barrier 

yes the lord be put on their armour 

what be he 

a new upstart one that swear like a falconer and will lie in the duke ear day by day like a maker of almanac and yet I know he since he come to the court smell worse of sweat than a undertenniscourt keeper 

look you yonder be your sweet mistress 

thou be my swear brother I will tell thou I do love that moor that witch very constrain she know some of my villainy I do love she just as a man hold a wolf by the ear but for fear of turn upon i and pull out my throat I will let she go to the devil 

I hear she claim marriage of thou 

i'faith I make to her some such dark promise and in seek to fly from it I run on like a fright dog with a bottle at his tail that fain will bite it off and yet dare not look behind he now my precious Gipsy 

I your love to i rather cool then heat 

marry I be the sound lover we have many wench about the town heat too fast 

what do you think of these perfume gallant then 

their satin can save they I be confident 
they have a certain spice of the disease 
for they that sleep with dog shall rise with flea 

believe it a little paint and gay clothes 
make you loathe i 

how love a lady for paint or gay apparel I will unkennel one example more for thou Aesop have a foolish dog that let go the flesh to catch the shadow I will have courtier be better diverse 

you remember your oath 

lover oath be like mariner prayer utter in extremity but when the tempest be over and that the vessel leave tumble they fall from protest to drink and yet among gentleman protest and drink go together and agree as well as shoemaker and Westphalia bacon they be both drawer on for drink draw on protestation and protestation draw on more drink be not this discourse better now than the mortality of your sunburn gentleman 

be this your perch you haggard fly to the stew 

you shall be clap by the heel now strike in the court

catch cold anights they dare not use a bedstaff 
for fear of her light finger 

you be a strumpet 
a impudent one 

why do you kick she say 
do you think that she be like a walnuttree 
must she be cudgel ere she bear good fruit 
Shee brag that you shall marry she 

what then 

I have rather she be pitch upon a stake 
in some newseeded garden to affright 
her fellow crow thence 

your a boy a fool 
be guardian to your hound I be of age 

if I take she near you I will cut her throat 

with a fan of feather 

and for you I will whip 
this folly from you 

be you choleric 
I will purge it with rhubarb

with thy heart blood
