of which there be not one pure she be compact 
mere of blood of bone and rot flesh 
which make her leprous where the sun exhale 
the moist complexion it do putrify 
the region of the air there be than another 
sometime the sun sit muffle in his cave 
while from the cloud fly hideous shower of rain 
which sweep the earth corruption into brook 
brook into river river send their tribute 
as they receive it to their sovereign 
the seethe ocean thus earth air and water 
be all infect she then frame of these 
can she be beautiful no Diomedes 
if they seem fair they have the help of art 
by nature they be ugly 

leave this detraction

who see young Pyrrhus 

I fear his too much rage have spur he on 
too far among the amazonian troop 

why stand you idle here and let the trojan 
lead warlike Pyrrhus prisoner to the town 

how Pyrrhus prisoner 

we see he compass by the Amazon 
Penthesilea with her bustain troop

I have not live to see Troy overthrow 

when do thou ever see a villain valiant 
what be past remember not but what be to come 
Priam have shut his gate and will no more 
meet he in arm can you with all your valour 
glide through the wall if not what be you near 
for all your ten year siege 

it be true some stratagem to enter Troy 
be admirable for prince till I see 
the temple burn wherein my father die 
and Troy no Troy but ash my revenge 
will have no stern aspect till I behold 
Troy groundsill swim in pool of crimson gore 
Rhamnusia altar fill with flow helm 
of blood and brain Priam and Hecuba 
drag by this hand to death and this my sword 
ravish the breast of fair Polixena 
I shall not think my father death revenge 

to he that can contrive 
a stratagem by which to enter Troy 
I will give the whole spoil of Apollo temple 

I my rich tent

I will set he straight a work 

upon some engine Sinon

ten kingdom for a horse to enter Troy 

stay let i see 
Ulysses you have the Palladium 

I have so 

call for Epeus then the general 
have no command in he 

let we know the project 

and that Palladium stand in Pallas temple 
and consecrate to she 

it do so 

call for Epeus then 

let we hear what thou intend 

I will have a horse build with so huge a bulk 
as shall contain a thousand man in arm 

and enter Troy with that 

do it you you trouble my invention 
I be grow muddy with your interruption 
good young man lend more patience hear i out 
this engine frame and stuff with arm Greek 
will you take down your tent march back to Tenedos 

what shall the horse do then 

not gallop as your tongue do good Ulysses 
lend i your apprehension when the trojan 
find you be go aboard they will straight suppose 
you will not weigh anchor till the god inform you 
of your success at sea if then a villain 
can drive into their ear the goddess Pallas 
offend for her steal Palladium 
will you erect this machine to her honour 
withal that be it bring into her temple 
it will retain the gilt Palladium virtue 
may not the forge tale move age Priam 
to hale this engine present to Troy 
pull down his wall for entrance leave a breach 
where in the dead of night all your whole army 
may enter take they sleep in their bed 
and put they all to sword 

it be rare 

it be admirable I will adventure 
my person in the horse 

do so and get a thousand spirit more 
king Agamemnon if you like the project 
down with your tent 

Sinon we will 

I will set a light upon the wall of Troy 
shall give the summons when you shall return 
about it prince Pyrrhus get you man 
in readiness I will expose myself 
to bewitch Priam with a weep tale 
I can to the life describe in word 
what I will express in action 

down with our tent 

I will to pick out bold Greek to fill the horse 
shine bright you lamp of heaven for ere it be long 
we will dim your radiant beam with flame light 
and bloody meteor from Troy burn street 

such sight be glorious spark in Sinon eye 
who long to feast the devil with tragedy 

the grecian go 

all their tent raise their ten year siege remove 
now Troy may rest secure 

they may report at their return to Greece 
the welcome they have have what have they win 
but wound time loss shame and confusion 

we now be lord of our own territory 
ten year keep from we by the invade greek 
now we may free take a full survey 
of all Scamander plain drink with the mixture 
of the opposite blood of trojan and of greek 

and royal husband we have cause to joy 
that after so long siege the greek be f●ed 
and you in peace may rest your age head 

upon this eastside stand Ulysses tent 
the politic greek 

there be old Nestor quarter 
and Agamemnon that the general 

upon the northside of the field Achilles 
that bloody greek pitch and upon this plain 
I well remember be my Hector slay 

this empty place be south from all the rest 
the valiant Diomedes have oft make good 
and here even here his rich pavilion stand 

but here even here near to duke Aiax tent 
round gird with Myrmidon my Troilus fall 

then be this place a stand lake of blood 
part of which moisture the bright sun exhale 
and part the thirsty earth have quaff to Mars 
but now the sword on either part be sheathe 
and after ten year tumult war surcease 
they lade their ship home with shameful peace 

for which we will praise the god banquet and feast 
since by their flight our glorious fame be increase 

soft what huge engine be that leave on the strand 
that bear the shape and figure of a horse 

what shall we hew it piecemeal with our sword 

o be not rash sure it be some mystery 
that this great architecture do include 

but my opinion be this steed huge bulk 
be stuff with greekish guile 

I rather think 
it be some monumental edifice 
unto the goddess Pallas consecrate 
then spare your fury 

why stand you gaze at this horrid craft 
forge by the fly Ulysses be his brain 
unknown in Troy or can you look for safety 
from those who ten year have besiege your wall 
either this huge swell bulk be big with soldier 
long to be deliver of arm greek 
who monstrous fatal and abhor birth 
will be Troy ruin else this hill of timber 
this horselike structure stable up in Troy 
will spurn down these our wall our tower demolish 
which it shall never come you trojan youth 
that love the public safety no proud greek 
upon this steed back over Troy wall shall ride 
first with this javelin I will transpierce his side 

what mean Laocoon 

prince stay his fury 

hark trojan if a jar noise of arm 
sigh not throw these deep cavern I divine 
this gluttonous womb have swallow a whole band 
of man in steel then with your sword and glave 
rip up his tough side and embowel he 
that we may prove how they have line his entrail 

stay and proceed no further in your rage 
till we have learn some novel from this greek 
who in a ditch we find fast gyve and bind 

Laocoon cease thy violence till we know 
from that poor grecian what that machine mean 

o i of all on earth most miserable 
who neither heaven will succour earth preserve 
nor sea keep safe ay who the heaven despise 
the earth abandon and the sea disdain 
where shall I shroud i who but now the greek 
threaten with vengeance and escape from they 
fall now into the hand of trojan menace death 
the world afford no place to wretched Sinon 
of comfort for where ere I fix my foot 
I tread upon my grave the four vast corner 
of this large universe in all their room 
and spacious emptiness will not afford i 
my body length of rest where ere I fly 
or stay or turn death be the object of my eye 

what be thou or whence come thou brief speak 
thou wretched man thou move we with thy tear 
unbind he soldier 

shall I deny myself to be of Greece 
because I be bring captive into Troy 
no Sinon can lie heaven earth and sea 
from all which I be outcast witness with i 
that Sinon can lie thrice damn Ulysses 
the blackhaired Pyrrhus and horn Menelaus 
crookbacked Thersites luxurious Diomedes 
and all the rabble of detest greek 
I call to witness Sinon can lie

supple my humble knee to crouch and bend 
heave at my bonnet shrug my shoulder thus 
grin in their face Sinon then have stand

alas good man 
shake off the timorous fear of servile death 
though amongst we trojan and thyself a greek 
thou be not now among thy enemy 
thy life I will warrant only let we know 
what this horse mean 

Greece I renounce thou thou have throw i off 
fair Troy● be thy creature now I will unrip 
Ulysses craft my fatal enemy

for that know murder do I haunt his tent 
with rail menace horrible exclaim 
many a blacksaint of wish oath and curse 
have I sing at his window then demand 
justice of Agamemnon Diomedes

now tell we what be the meaning of this horse 
why have they leave he here themselves be go 

my new release hand thus I heave on high

beneath who stroke I lay since my base country 
cast i away to death I be now bear 
a son of Troy not Hector while he live 
more damage Greece by his all wound arm 
than I by my discovery well you know 
how the greek honour Pallas who incense 
because Ulysses the Palladium steal 
out of her temple and her warder slay 
in rage she threaten ruin to all Greece 
therefore to she have Calchas build this horse 
Greece pardon i and all my country god 
be deaf to Sinon tale and let it be 
henceforth forget that I be bear in Greece 
lest time to come record what I reveal 
the black confusion of my native weal 

and what be that Sinon 

where leave I at the horse build of that size 
lest you shall give it entrance at your gate 
for know shall your rude hand dare to profane 
this gift sacred to Pallas rot and disease 
pest and infection shall depopulate you 
and in a small short season they return 
shall see thy subject slay fair Troy bright burn 
I be even with thou Ulysses and my breath 
strike all Greece home for my intend death 

thank Sinon we shall bounteous reward thou 

and see my liege to make good his report 
Laocoon he that with his javelin pierce 
this gift of Pallas round embrace with snake 
that wind their train about his wound waist 
and for his late presumption sting he dead 

we have not see so strange a prodigy 
Laocoon have offend all the god 
in his profane attempt 

then lend your help hand

but here with Cressida abide he here 
o why be Helen at the first so fair 
to be come subject to so foul a end 
or how have Cressida beauty sin against heaven 
that it be brand thus with leprosy 

I in conceit think that I may contend 
against heaven splendour I do once suppose 
there be no beauty but in Cressida look 
but in her eye no pure divinity 
but now behold i Helen 

in she I see 
all beauty frailty and this object make 
all fairness to show ugly in itself 
but to see breathless virgin pile on heap 
what less can Helen do then curse these star 
that shine so bright at her nativity 
and with her nail tear out these shine ball 
that have set Troy on fire 

Pierce all the trojan lady with your sword 
lest amongst they you may spare Polixena 

stay I shall know that face it be Helena

Pyrrhus forbear 
it be the spartan queen 

if Helen the adulterous strumpet die 
I will be her deathsman

death from thy hand be welcome 

hold I say 
she be Clytaemnestra sister for her sake 
Helen shall live and kingly Menelaus 
receive she into favour 

Agamemnon 
be too remiss I have swear all blood to spill 
I meet with and this one will Pyrrhus kill 

and I this other 

for our sake Menelaus let she live 
be not our sister bear against her will 
from Sparta for that wrong do by the trojan 
do not Troy burn and be not all our sword 
stain in the blood of Paris slaughter friend 
you shall be reconcile to Helen 
and bear she back to Greece 

Helen at shrift alas poor penitent quean 
do hear i Menelaus pardon she 
take she again to Sparta thou will else want 
so kind a bedfellow 

take back my shame 

yes for thy pleasure 
there be in the world as rich and honourable 
as thou who lend the pleasure of their bed 
to other and then take they back again 
as they can get they 

my brow shall never bear 
such character of shame 

thy brow bear horn already but who see they 
when thou return to Sparta some will think 
thou be a cuckold but who be it dare say so 
thou be a king thy sin be cloud over 
where poor man fault by tongue be make much more 
of all man live king be last shall hear 
of their dishonour 

what inferior beast 
dare tell the lion of his tyranny 
who be not tear asunder with his paw 
the king of Sparta therefore need not fear 
the tongue of subject bid our sister rise 
to safety in thy arm 

do Menelaus 

but will my Helen then by future virtue 
redeem she long lose honour 

if with tear 
the heaven may be appease for Helen sin 
they shall have penitent shower if menelaus 
may with the spirit of love be satisfy 
he ten time rectify my forfeit honour 
before I touch his bed

and without sense or motion apoplex 
and only hear i speak Orestes he 
who as if marble by Medusa head 
have not one tear to fall or sigh to spend 
till I find out the murderer and on he 
inflict remarkable vengeance for I vow 
be it my father brother or his queen 
have thou my weep sister hand in it 
if he who equal if not rank above 
I ever do and shall love Pylades 
be it she who womb do bear i where I lie 
full nine month bed ere I see the sun 
or the most abject traitor under heaven 
their doom be all alike and this I vow 
now you who this silent and speechless king 
have oft command this now senseless brain 
as oft direct this now strengthless hand 
more oft protect in a war that shall 
be to all time example lend your shoulder 
to bear he who have keep you all in life 
this be a black and mourn funeral right 
deed of this nature must be thorough search

tush fair Hermione 
these sight that seem to lady terrible 
be common to we soldier when from field return 
all smear in blood where duke and king lie slay 
yet in our tent at midnight it fright not we 
from court a sweet mistress 

he say right 
and note of this how I can poetize 
this his great father of his love desire 
when from the slaughter of his foe retire 
he doff his cush and unarm his head 
to tumble with she on a soft day bed 
it do rejoice Brifois to embrace 
his bruise arm and kiss his bloodstained face 
these hand which he so often do imbrue 
in blood of warlike trojan who he slay 
be then employ to tickle touch and feel 
and shake a lance that have no print of steel 

continue in that vein I will feed thy muse 
with crayfish prawn and lobster

peace Thersites 
and Sinon you no more 

we see by Agamemnon all be mortal 
and I but show his niece Hermione 
the way of all flesh 

it be a easy path 
the mother and the aunt have tread it both 
if she have wit to follow 

if it be so Aegisthus be a traitor 
and she no more our sister 

it be not possible 
a queen of her high birth and parentage 
shall have such base hand in her husband death 
her husband and her sovereign 

double treason 
can it be prove against she 

it appear 
so far against humanity and nature 
we dare not once suspect it but till proof 
explain it further hold it in suspense 

o but their sudden flight and fortify 

these be indeed presumption but leave that 
to a most strict inquiry even for reverence 
of majesty and honour to all queen 
for love of we because she be our sister 
both for Orestes and Electra sake 
who birth be brand in so foul a deed 
till we examine further circumstance

so sure they be his murderer this disguise 
will suit a act of death full to the life 
he stand upon a strict and secure guard 
I have plot your admittance it will take 
doubt not it can fail I have cast it so 

as send from Menelaus 

who name else 
can break through such strong guard where fear and guilt 
keep hourly watch

and it be a fruitful year for villainy 
and I a thrive farmer in this interim

Ulysses without parallel for wit 
against they all so that the first combustion 
shall burn they up to ash o Palamedes

stream from prince breast than Cethus shall 
brother for thy untimely funeral 

let none presume to dare into our presence 
or pass our guard but such well know to we and to our queen 

the charge have pass we round 

when sin of such high nature against we rise 
it be fit we shall be keep with heedful eye 

presume it my Aegisthus we be safe 
the fort wherein we live impregnable 
or say we be surprise by stratagem 
or shall expose our life unto the censure 
of law and justice even in these extreme 
there be not the least fear of difficulty 

your reason madam 

who do this concern 
but our own blood shall Pyrrhus grow enrage 
I have at hand my niece Hermione 
to calm his fury what do this belong to 
Ulysses or aetolian Diomedes 
be they not stranger if it come in question 
by Menelaus be he not our brother 
our sister Helen in his bosom sleep 
and can with he do all thing fear not then 
we be every way secure
