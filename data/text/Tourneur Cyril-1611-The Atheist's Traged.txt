i see my nephew Charlemont but now 
part from his father tell he I desire 
to speak with he 
Borachio thou be read 
in nature and her large philosophy 
observe thou not the very self same course 
of revolution both in man and beast 

the same for birth growth state decay and death 
only a man be behold to his nature 
for the better composition of the two 

but where that favour of his nature be 
not full and free you fee a man become 
a fool as littleknowing as a beast 

that show there be nothing in a man above 
his nature if there be consider it be 
his being excellency it will not yield 
to nature weakness 

then if death cast up 
our total sum of joy and happiness 
let i have all my sense feast in 
the abundant fullness of delight at once 
and with a sweet insensible increase 
of please surfeit melt into my dust 

that revolution be too short methinks 
if this life comprehend our happiness 
how foolish to desire to die so soon 
and if our time run home unto the length 
of nature how improvident it be 
to spend our substance on a minute pleasure 
and after live a age in misery 

So thou conclude that pleasure only flow 
upon the stream of riches 

wealth be lord 
of all felicity 

it be oracle 
for what be a man that be honest without wealth 

both miserable and contemptible 

he be worse Borachio for if charity 
be a essential part of honesty 
and shall be practise first upon ourselves 
which must be grant then your honest man 
that be poor be most dishonest for he be 
uncharitable to the man who he 
shall most respect but what do this touch i 
that seem to have enough thank industry 
it be true have not my body spread itself 
into posterity perhaps I shall 
desire no more increase of substance then 
will hold proportion with my own dimension 
yet even in that sufficiency of state 
a man have reason to provide and add 
for what be he have such a present eye 
and so prepare a strength that can foresee 
and fortify his substance and himself 
against those accident the least whereof 
may rob he of a age husbandry 
and for my child they be as near to i 
as branch to the tree whereon they grow 
and may as numerous be multiply 
as they increase so shall my providence 
for from my substance they receive the sap 
whereby they live and flourish 

sir enough 
I understand the mark whereat you aim 

silence Ware interrupt Charlemont 

good morrow uncle 

noble Charlemont 
good morrow be not this the honour day 
you purpose to set forward to the war 

my inclination do intend it so 

and not your resolution 

yes my lord 
have not my father contradict it 

o noble war thou first original 
of all man honour how deject 
the base spirit of our present time 
have cast itself below the ancient worth 
of our forefather from who noble deed 
ignoble we derive our pedigree 

sir tax not i for his unwillingness 
by the command of his authority 
my disposition be force against itself 

nephew you be the honour of our blood 
the troop of gentry who inferior worth 
shall second your example be become 
your leader and the scorn of their discourse 
turn smile back upon your backwardness 

you need not urge my spirit by disgrace 
it be free enough my father hinder it 
to curb i he deny i maintenance 
to put i in the habit of my rank 
unbind i from that strong necessity 
and call i coward if I stay behind 

for want of mean Borachio where be the gold 
I will disinherit my posterity 
to purchase honour it be a interest 
I prize above the principal of wealth 
I be glad I have the occasion to make know 
how ready my substance shall unlock 
itself to serve you here be a thousand crown 

my worthy uncle in exchange for this 
I leave my bond so I be double bind 
by that for the repayment of this gold 
and by this gold to satisfy your love 

sir it be a witness only of my love 
and love do always satisfy itself 
now to your father labour his consent 
my importunity shall second you 
we will obtain it 

if entreaty fail 
the force of reputation shall prevail 

go call my son that they may take their leaf 
of noble Charlemont now my Borachio 

the substance of our former argument 
be wealth 

the question how to compass it 

young Charlemont be go to the war 

o thou begin to take i 

mark i then 
methinks the pregnant wit of man may make 
the happy absence of this Charlemont 
a subject for commodious providence 
he have a wealthy father ready even 
to drop into his grave and no man power 
when Charlemont be go can interpose 
betwixt you and he 

thou have apprehend both 
my meaning and my love now let thy trust 
for undertake and for secrecy 
hold measure with thy amplitude of wit 
and thy reward shall parallel thy worth 

my resolution have already bind 
i to your service 

and my heart to thou 
here be my son 
there be my eternity my life in they 
and their succession shall for ever live 
and in my reason dwell the providence 
to add to life as much of happiness 
let all man lose so I increase my gain 
I have no feel of another pain 

I prithee let this current of my tear 
divert thy inclination from the war 
for of my child thou be only leave 
to promise a succession to my house 
and all the honour thou can get by arm 
will give but vain addition to thy name 
since from thy ancestor thou do derive 
a dignity sufficient and as great 
as thou have substance to maintain and bear 
I prithee stay at home 

my noble father 
the weak sigh you breath have power to turn 
my strong purpose and your soft tear 
to melt my resolution to as soft 
obedience but my affection to the war 
be as hereditary as my blood 
to every life of all my ancestry 
your predecessor be your precedent 
and you be my example shall I serve 
for nothing but a vain parenthesis 
in the honour story of your family 
or hang but like a empty scutcheon 
between the trophy of my predecessor 
and the rich arm of my posterity 
there be not a Frenchman of good blood and youth 
but either out of spirit or example 
be turn a soldier only Charlemont 
must be repute that same heartless thing 
that coward will be bold to play upon 

good morrow my lord 

morrow good brother 

good morrow uncle 

morrow kind nephew 
what have you wash your eye with tear this morning 
Come by my soul his purpose do deserve 
your free consent your tenderness dissuade he 
what to the father of a gentleman 
shall be more tender than the maintenance 
and the increase of honour to his house 
my lord here be my boy I shall be proud 
that either this be able or that incline 
to be my nephew brave competitor 

your importunity have overcome 
pray God my force grant prove not ominous 

we have obtain it ominous in what 
it can be in anything but death 
and I be of a confident belief 
that even the time place manner of our death 
do follow fate with that necessity 
that make we sure to die and in a thing 
ordain so certain unalterable 
what can the use of providence prevail

to moderate her passion let she grief

and fear not that your profit shall be small 
your interest shall exceed your principal 

monsieur Languebeau happy encounter the honesty of your conversation make i request more interest in your familiarity

I embrace your disposition and desire to give you as liberal assurance of my love as my lord Belforest your deserve favourer 

his lordship be please with my plainness and truth of conversation 

it can displease he in the behaviour of his noble daughter Castabella a man may read her worth and your instruction 

that gentlewoman be most sweet modest fair honest handsome wise wellborn and rich 

you have give i her picture in small 

she be like your diamond a temptation in every man eye yet not yield to any light impression herself 

the praise be she but the comparison your own 

you shall forgive i that sir 

I will not do so much at your request as forgive you it I will only give you it sir by you will make i swear

yet unprofitable keep without use Shee deserve a worthy husband sir I have often wish a match between my elder son and she the marriage will join the house of Belforest and Damville into a noble alliance 

and the unity of family be a work of love and charity

Charlemont thy gratuity and my promise be both but word and both like word shall vanish into air for thy poor empty hand I must be mute 
this give i feeling of a better suit 

Borachio do precise note this man 

his own profession will report he pure 

And seem to know if any benefit 
arise of religion after death 
yet but compare his profession with his life 
they so direct contradict themselves 
as if the end of his instruction be 
but to divert the world from sin that he 
more easy may engross it to himself 
by that I be confirm a atheist 
well Charlemont be go and here thou see 
his absence the foundation of my plot 

he be the man who Castabella love 

that be the reason I propound he 
employment fix upon a foreign place 
to draw his inclination out of the way 

it have leave the passage of our practice free 

This Castabella be a wealthy heir 
and by her marriage with my elder son 
my house be honour and my state increase 
this work alone deserve my industry 
but if it prosper thou shall see my brain 
make this but a induction to a point 
so full of profitable policy 
that it will make the soul of honesty 
ambitious to turn villain 

I bespeak 
employment in it I will be a instrument 
to grace performance with dexterity 

thou shall no man shall rob thou of the honour 
go present and buy a crimson scarf 
like Charlemont prepare thou a disguise 
in the habit of a soldier hurt and lame 
and then be ready at the wedding feast 
where thou shall have employment in a work 
will please thy disposition 

as I vow 
your instrument shall make your project proud 

this marriage will bring wealth if that succeed 
I will increase it though my brother bleed 

nay good sir in troth if you know how little it please i you will forbear it 

I will not leave thou till thou have entertain i for thy servant 

my servant you be sick you say you will tax i of indiscretion to entertain one that be not able to do i service 

the service of a gentlewoman consist most in chamber work and sick man be fit for the chamber I prithee give i a favour 

methinks you have a very sweet favour of you own 

I lack but your black eye 

if you go to buffet among the boy they will give you one 

nay if you grow bitter I will dispraise your black eye the grey eiee morning make the fair day 

now that you dissemble not I can be willing to give you a favour what favour will you have 

any toy any light thing 

fie will you be so uncivil to ask a light thing at a gentlewoman hand 

will give i a bracelet of thy hair then 

do you want hair sir 

no faith I will want no hair so long as I can have it for money 

what will you do with my hair then 

wear it for thy sake sweet heart 

do you think I love to have my hair wear off 

come you be so witty now and so sensible 

tush I will I want one of my sense now 

bitter again what be that smell 

no no no why now you be satisfy I hope I have give you a favour 

what favour a kiss I prithee give i another 

show i that I give you then 

how shall I show it 

you be unworthy of a favour if you will not bestow the keep of it one minute 

well in plain term do love i that be the purpose of my come 

love you yes very well 

give i thy hand upon it 

nay you mistake i if I love you very well I must not love you now for now your be not very well you be sick 

this equivocation be for the jest now 

I speak it as it be now in fashion in earnest but I shall not be in quiet for you I perceive till I have give you a favour do you love i 

with all my heart 

then with all my heart I will give you a jewel to hang in your ear hark you I can never love you 

call you this a jewel to hang in my ear it be no light favour for I will be swear it come somewhat heavy to i well I will not leave she for all this methinks it animate a man to stand to it when a woman desire to be rid of he at the first sight 

I entertain the offer of this match 
with purpose to confirm it present 
I have already move it to my daughter 
her soft excuse savour at the first 
methinks but of a modest innocence 
of blood who unmoved stream be never draw 
into the current of affection but when I 
reply with more familiar argument 
think to make her apprehension bold 
her modest blush fall to a pale dislike 
and she refuse it with such confidence 
as if she have be prompt by a love 
incline firm to some other man 
and in that obstinacy she remain 

very that disobedience do not become a child it proceed from a unsanctified liberty you will be accessary to your own dishonour if you suffer it 

your honest wisdom have advise i well 
once more I will move she by persuasive mean 
if she resist all mildness set apart 
I will make use of my authority 

and instant lest fear your constraint her contrary affection teach she some devise that may prevent you 

to cut off every opportunity 
procrastination may assist she with 
this instant night she shall be marry 

Best 

please it your lordship my mother attend 
in the gallery and desire your conference 
this mean I use to bring i to your ear 
time cut off circumstance I must be brief 
to your integrity do Charlemont 
commit the contract of his love and i 
which now so strong a hand seek to divide 
that if your grave advice assist i not 
I shall be force to violate my faith 

since Charlemont absence I have weigh his love with the spirit of consideration and in sincerity I find it to be frivolous and vain withdraw your respect his affection deserve it not 

good sir I know your heart can profane 
the holiness you make profession of 
with such a vicious purpose as to break 
the vow your own consent do help to make 

can he deserve your love who in neglect of your delightful conversation and in obstinate contempt of all your prayer and tear absent himself so far from your sweet fellowship and with a purpose so contract to that absence that you see he purchase your separation with the hazard of his blood and life fear to want pretence to part your company it be rather hate that do division move love still desire the presence of his love very he be not of the family of love 

o do not wrong he it be a generous mind 
that lead his disposition to the war 
for gentle love and noble courage be 
so near ally that one beget another 
or love be sister and courage be the brother 
can I affect he better than before 
his soldier heart will make i love he more 

but Castabella 

tush you mistake the way into a woman 
the passage lie not through her reason but her blood 
nay stay how will thou call the child 
that be raise with cost and tenderness 
to full hability of body and mean 
deny relief unto the parent who 
bestow that bring up 

unnatural 

then Castabella be unnatural 
nature the love mother of we all 
bring forth a woman for her own relief 
by generation to revive her age 
which now thou have hability and mean 
present most unkind do deny 

believe i mother I do love a man 

prefer the affection of a absent love 
before the sweet possession of a man 
the barren mind before the fruitful body 
where our creation have no reference 
to man but in his body be make 
only for generation which unless 
our child can be get by conceit 
must from the body come if reason be 
our counsellor we will neglect the work 
of generation for the prodigal 
expense it draw we too of that which be 
the wealth of life wise nature therefore have 
reserve for a inducement to our sense 
our great pleasure in that great work 
which be offer thou thy ignorance 
refuse for the imaginary joy 
of a unsatisfy affection to 
a absent man who blood once spend in the war 
then he will come home sick lame and impotent 
and wed thou to a torment like the pain 
of Tantalus continue thy desire 
with fruitless presentation of the thing 
it love still move and still unsatisfied 

now Levidulcia have thou yet prepare 
my daughter love to entertain this man 
her husband here 

I be but her mother inlaw 
yet if she be my very flesh and blood 
I can advise no better for good

it be very true my lord 

can thou relate it 

yes 

I prithee do 

the enemy defeat of a fair 
advantage by a flatter stratagem 
plant all the artillery against the town 
who thunder and lightning make our bulwark shake 
and threaten in that terrible report 
the storm wherewith they mean to second it 
the assault be general but for the place 
that promise most advantage to be force 
the pride of all their army be draw forth 
and equal divide into front 
and rear they march And come to a stand 
ready to pass our channel at a ebb 
we advise it for our safe course to draw 
our sluice up and make it unpassable 
our governor oppose and suffer they 
to charge we home even to the rampire foot 
but when their front be force up our breach 
at push of pike then do his policy 
let go the sluice and trip up the heel 
of the whole body of their troop that stand 
within the violent current of the stream 
their front beleaguer betwixt the water and 
the town see the flood be grow too deep 
to promise they a safe retreat expose 
the force of all their spirit like the last 
expire gasp of a strong heart man 
upon the hazard of one charge but be 
oppress and fall the rest that can not swim 
be only drown but those that think to escape 
by swim be by murderer that flanker 
the level of the flood both drown and slay 

now by my soul soldier a brave service 

o what become of my dear Charlemont 

walk next day upon the fatal shore 
among the slaughter body of their man 
which the fullstomacked sea have cast upon 
the sand it be my unhappy chance to light 
upon a face who favour when it live

he lie in his armour as if that have be 
his coffin and the weep sea like one 
who mild temper do lament the death 
of he who in his rage he slay run up 
the shore embrace he kiss his cheek 
go back again and force up the sand 
to bury he and every time it part 
shed tear upon he till at last as if 
it can no long endure to see the man 
who it have slay yet loath to leave he with 
a kind of unresolved unwilling pace 
wind her wave one in another like 
a man that fold his arm or wring his hand 
for grief ebb from the body and descend 
as if it will sink down into the earth 
and hide itself for shame of such a deed 

and soldier who be this 

o Charlemont 

your fear have tell you that whereof my grief 
be loath to be the messenger 

o God 

Charlemont drown why how can that be since it be the adverse party that receive the overthrow 

his forward spirit press into the front 
and be engage within the enemy 
when they retreat through the rise stream 
in the violent confusion of the throng 
be overbear and perish in the flood 
and here be the sad remembrance of his life the scarf 
which for his sake I will for ever wear

a instrumental help yet nothing from 
the induction to the accomplishment seem force 
or do of purpose but by accident

impression of premeditate thing 
by serious apprehension leave upon 
our mind or else the imaginary shape 
of object proper to the complexion or 
the disposition of our body these 
can neither of they be the cause why I 
shall dream thus for my mind have not be move 
with any one conception of a thought 
to such a purpose nor my nature wont

like trouble water falsify the shape 
of thing retain in they and make they seem 
confound when they be distinguish so 
my action daily conversant with war 
the argument of blood and death have leave 
perhaps the imaginary presence of 
some bloody accident upon my mind 
which mix confuse with other thought 
whereof the remembrance of my father may 
be one present all together seem 
incorporate as if his body be 
the owner of that blood the subject of 
that death when he be at Paris and that blood 
shed here it may be thus I will not leave

but she shall bear a live monument 
to let succeed age true know 
that she be satisfy what he do owe 
both principal and use because his worth 
be better at his death then at his birth 

and with his body place that memory 
of noble Charlemont his worthy son 
and give their grave the rite that do belong 
to soldier they be soldier both the father 
hold open war with sin the son with blood 
this in a war more gallant that more good 

there place their arm and here their epitaph 
and may these line survive the last of grave 
here lie the ash of that earth and fire 
who heat and fruit dead feed and warm the poor 
and they as if they will in sigh expire 
and into tear dissolve his death deplore 
he do that good freely for goodness sake 
unforced for generousness he hold so dear 
that he fear none but he that do he make 
and yet he serve he more for love then fear 
so be life provide that though he do die 
a death yet die not sudden 
his body lie inter within this will 
who die a young man yet depart old 
and in all strength of youth that man can have 
be ready still to drop into his grave 
for age in virtue with a youthful eye 
he welcome it be still prepare to die 
and live so though young deprive of breath 
he do not suffer a untimely death 
but we may say of his brave bless decease 
he die in war and yet he die in peace 

o may that fire revive the ash of 
this phoenix yet the wonder will not be 
so great as he be good and wonder at 
for that his life example be so true 
a practic of religion theory 
that her divinity seem rather the 
description than the instruction of his life 
and of his goodness be his virtuous son 
a worthy imitator so that on 
these two herculean pillar where their arm 
be place there may be write non ultra for 
beyond their life as well for youth as age 
nor young nor old in merit or in name 
shall ever exceed their virtue or their fame

I grant the heaven thy goodness do command 
our punishment but yet no further than 
the measure of our sin how shall they else 
be just or how shall that good purpose of 
thy justice take effect by bound man 
within the confine of humanity 
when our affliction do exceed our crime 
then they do rather teach the barbarous world 
example that extend her cruelty 
beyond their own dimension and instruct 
our action to be more more barbarous 
o my afflict soul how torment swell 
thy apprehension with profane conceit 
against the sacred justice of my God 
Oure own construction be the author of 
our misery we never measure our 
condition but with man above we in 
estate so while our spirit labour to 
be high than our fortune they be more base 
since all those attribute which make man seem 
superior to we be man subject and 
be make to serve he the repine man 
be of a servile spirit to deject 
the value of himself below their estimation 

here take my sword how now my wild swaggerer you be tame enough now be you not the penury of a prison be like a soft consumption it will humble the pride of your mortality and arm your soul in complete patience to endure the weight of affliction without feel it what have no music in thou thou have treble and base enough treble injury and base usage but treble and base make poor music without mean thou want mean do what do droop be deject 

no sir I have a heart above the reach 
of thy most violent maliciousness 
a fortitude in scorn of thy contempt 
since fate be please to have i suffer it 
that can bear more than thou have power to inflct 
I be a baron that thy father have 
deprive i off in stead of that I be 
create king I have lose a signiory 
that be confine within a piece of earth 
a wart upon the body of the world 
but now I be a emperor of a world 
this little world of man my passion be 
my subject and I can command they laugh 
while thou do tickle they to death with misery 

it be brave speak and I love thou for it thou lie here for a thousand crown here be a thousand to redeem thou not for the ransom of my life thou give i that I value not at one crown it be none of my deed thank my father for it it be his goodness yet he look not for thanks for he do it under hand out of a reserve disposition to do thou good without ostentation out of great heart you will refuse it now will you 

no since I must submit myself to fate I never will neglect the offer of one benefit but entertain they as her favour and the induction to some end of better fortune as who instrument I thank thy courtesy

shall die and rot in prison and it be just 

o father mercy be a attribute 
as high as justice a essential part 
of his unbounded goodness who divine 
impression form and image man shall bear

dear sir since by your greatness you 
be near heaven in place be near it 
in goodness rich man shall transcend the poor 
as cloud the earth raise by the comfort of 
the sun to water dry and barren ground 
if neither the impression in your soul 
of goodness nor the duty of your place 
as goodness substitute can move you then 
let nature which in savage in beast 
can stir to pity tell you that he be 
your kinsman 

you expose your honesty 
to strange construction why shall you so urge 
release for Charlemont come you profess 
more nearness to he than your modesty

for conversation or society 
with pardon I will rude take my leave 

good night dear nephew 
see thou that same man 

your meaning sir 

that fellow life Borachio 
like a superfluous letter in the law 
endanger our assurance 

scrape he out 

will do it 

give i your purpose I will do it 

sad melancholy have draw Charlemont 
with meditation on his father death 
into the solitary walk behind the church 

the churchyard This the fit place for death 
perhaps he be pray then he be fit to die 
we will send he charitable to his grave 

no matter how thou take he first take this 
thou know the place observe his passage 
and with the most advantage make a stand 
that favour by the darkness of the night 
his breast may fall upon thou at so near 
a distance that he shall shun the blow 
the deed once do thou may retire with safety 
the place be unfrequented and his death 
will be impute to the attempt of thief 

be careless let your mind be free and clear 
this pistol shall discharge you of your fear 

but let i call my project to account 
for what effect and end I have engage 
myself in all this blood to leave a state 
to the succession of my proper blood 
but how shall that succession be continue 
not in my elder son I fear disease 
and weakness have disable he for issue 
for the toth his loose humour will endure 
no bond of marriage and I doubt his life 
his spirit be so bold dangerous 
o pity that the profitable end 
of such a prosperous murder shall be lose 
nature forbid I hope I have a body 
that will not suffer i to lose my labour 
for want of issue yet but then it must be 
a bastard tush they only father bastard 
that father other man beget daughter 
be it my own let it come whence it will 
I be resolve daughter

This fall out happy 

twelve 

it be a good hour it will strike one anon 

how fit a place for contemplation be this dead of night among the dwelling of the dead this grave perhaps the inhabitant be in his life time the possessor of his own desire yet in the midst of all his greatness and his wealth he be less rich and less content then in this poor piece of earth low and lesser than a cottage for here he neither want nor care now that his body favour of corruption he enjoy a sweet rest than ever he do among the sweet pleasure of this life for here there be nothing trouble he and there in that grave lie another he perhaps be in his life as full of misery as this of happiness and here be a end of both now both their state be equal o that man with so much labour shall aspire to worldly height when in the humble earth the world condition be at the best or scorn inferior man since to be low than a worm be to be high than a king 

then fall and rise 

what villain hand be that save thou or thou shall perish 

zounds unsaved I think 

what have I kill he whatsoever thou be I will thy hand have prosper for I be unfit to live and well prepare to die what shall I do accuse myself Submit i to the law and that will quick end this violent increase of misery but it be a murder to be accessary to my own death I will not I will take this opportunity to escape it may be heaven reserve i to some better end 

nay good sir I dare not in good sooth I come of a generation both by father and mother that be all as fruitful as costermonger wife 

tush then a tympany be the great danger can be fear their fruitfulness turn but to a certain kind of phlegmatic windy disease 

I must put my understanding to your trust sir I will be loath to be deceive 

no conceive thou shall it not yet thou shall profit by my instruction too my body be not every day draw dry wench 

yet methinks sir your want of use shall rather make your body like a well the lesser it be draw the soon it grow dry 

thou shall try that instant 

but we want place and opportunity 

we have both this be the back side of the house which the superstitious call saint Winifred church and be very a convenient unfrequented place where under the close curtain of the night 

you purpose in the dark to make i light Pulles out a sheet a hair and a beard but what have you there 

this disguise be for security sake wench there be a talk thou know that the ghost of old mon ferrer walk in this church he be bury now if any stranger fall upon we before our business be end in this disguise I shall be take for that ghost and never be call to examination I warrant thou thus we shall escape both prevention and discovery how do I look in this habit wench 

so like a ghost that notwithstanding I have some foreknowledge of you you make my hair stand almost a end 

I will try how I can kiss in this beard oh fie fie fie I will put it off and then kiss and then put it on I can do the rest without kiss 

what have we here a sheet a hair a beard what end be this disguise intend for no matter what I will not expostulate the purpose of a friendly accident perhaps it may accommodate my escape I fear I be pursue for more assurance I will hide i here in the charnel house this convocationhouse of dead man skull to get into the charnel house he take hold of a death head it slip and stagger he death head deceive my hold such be the trust to all mortality 

my lord the night grow late your lordship speak of something you desire to move in private 

yes now I will speak it the argument be love the small ornament of thy sweet form that abstract of all pleasure can command the sense into passion and thy entire perfection be my object yet I love thou with the freedom of my reason I can give thou reason for my love 

love i my lord I do believe it for I be the wife of he you love 

it be true by my persuasion thou be force to marry one unable to perform the office of a husband I be author of the wrong my conscience suffer under it and I will disburden it by satisfaction 

how 

I will supply that pleasure to thou which he can 

be you a devil or a man 

a man and such a man as can return thy entertainment with as prodigal a body as the covetous desire of woman ever be delight with So that beside the full performance of thy empty husband duty thou shall have the joy of child to continue the succession of thy blood for the appetite that steal her pleasure draw the force of the body to a unite strength and put they altogether into action never fail of procreation all the purpose of man aim but at one of these two end pleasure or profit and in this one sweet conjunction of our love they both will meet will it not grieve thou that a stranger to thy blood shall lay the first foundation of his house upon the ruin of thy family 

now heaven defend i may my memory be utter extinguish and the heir of he that be my father enemy raise his eternal monument upon our ruin ere the great pleasure or the great profit ever tempt i to continue it by incest 

incest tush these distance affinity observe be article of bondage cast upon our freedom by our own subjection nature allow a general liberty of generation to all creature else shall man to who command and use all creature be make subject be less free than they 

o God be thy unlimited and infinite omnipotence less free because thou do not ill or if you argue mere out of nature do you not degenerate from that and be you not unworthy the prerogative of nature masterpiece when base you prescribe yourself authority and law from their example who you shall command I can confute you but the horror of the argument confound my understanding sir I know you do but try i in your son behalf suspect that my strength and youth of blood can contain themselves with impotence believe i sir I never wrong he if it be your lust oh quench it on their prostitute flesh who trade of sin can please desire with more delight and less offence the poison of your breath evaporate from so foul a soul infect the air more than the damp that rise from body but half rot in their grave 

kiss i I warrant thou my breath be sweet these dead man bone lie here of purpose to invite we to supply the number of the live Come we will get young bone and do it I will enjoy thou no nay then invoke your great suppose protector I will do it 

suppose protector be you a atheist then I know my prayer and tear be spend in vain o patient heaven why do thou not express thy wrath in thunderbolt to tear the frame of man in piece how can earth endure the burden of this wickedness without a earthquake or the angry face of heaven be not inflame with lightning 

conjure up the devil and his dam cry to the grave the dead can hear thou invocate their help 

o will this grave may open and my body be bind to the dead carcase of a man for ever ere it entertain the lust of this detest villain 

tereaslike thus I will force my passage to 

the devil 

my dear Charlemont 

for all my wrong I thank thou gracious heaven thou have make i satisfaction to reserve i for this bless purpose now sweet death I will bid thou welcome Come I will guard thou home and then I will cast myself into the arm of apprehension that the law may make this worthy work the crown of all my action be the best and last 

the last the law now heaven forbid what have you do 

why I have kill a man not murder he my Castabella he will have murder i 

then Charlemont the hand of heaven direct thy defence 
that wicked atheist I suspect his plot 

my life he seek I will he have it since he have deprive i of those blessing that shall make i love it come I will give it he 

you shall I will first expose myself to certain danger then for my defence destroy the man that save i from destruction 

thou can not satisfy i better than to be the instrument of my release from misery 

then work it by escape leave i to this protection that still guard the innocent or I will be a partner in your destiny 

my soul be heavy Come lie down to rest

be mount only to behold the face 
of your more rich imperious eminence 
with unprevented sight unmask fair queen 
vouchsafe their expectation may enjoy 
the gracious favour they admit to see 
these be the star the minister of fate 
and man high wisdom the superior power 
to which their force be subordinate 

D'amville with all thy wisdom thou be a fool 
not like those fool that we term innocent 
but a most wretched miserable fool 
which instant to the confusion of 
thy project with despair thou shall behold 

what foolish dream dare interrupt my rest 
to my confusion how can that be since 
my purpose have hitherto be bear 
with prosperous judgement to secure success 
which nothing live to dispossess i off 
but apprehend Charlemont and he 
this brain have make the happy instrument 
to free suspicion to annihilate 
all interest and title of his own 
to seal up my assurance and confirm 
my absolute possession by the law 
thus while the simple honest worshipper 
of a fantastic providence groan under 
the burden of neglect misery 
my real wisdom have raise up a state 
that shall eternize my posterity 
what be that 

the body of your young son slay by the lord Belforest

the doctor be come my lord 

doctor behold two patient in who care thy skill may purchase a eternal fame if thou have any read in Hipocrates Galen or Avicen if herb or drug or mineral have any power to save now let thy practice and their sovereign use raise thou to wealth and honour 

if any root of life remain within they capable of physic fear they not my lord 

ooh 

his gasp sigh be like the fall noise of some great build when the groundwork break on these two pillar stand the stately frame and architecture of my lofty house a earthquake shake they the foundation shrink dear nature in who honour I have raise a work of glory to posterity oh bury not the pride of that great action under the fall and ruin of itself 

my lord these body be deprive of all the radical ability of nature the heat of life be utter extinguish nothing remain within the power of man that can restore they 

take this gold extract the spirit of it and inspire new life into their body 

nothing can my lord

o there expire the date of my posterity can nature be so simple or malicious to destroy the reputation of her proper memory she can sure there be some power above she that control her force 

a power above nature doubt you that my lord Consider but whence man receive his body and his form not from corruption like some worm and fly but only from the generation of a man for nature never do bring forth a man without a man nor can the first man be but the passive subject not the active mover be the maker of himself so of necessity there must be a superior power to nature 

now to myself I be ridiculous nature thou be a traitor to my soul thou have abuse my trust I will complain to a superior court to right my wrong I will prove thou a forger of false assurance in yonder star chamber thou shall answer it withdraw the body o the sense of death begin to trouble my distract soul 

bring forth the malefactor to the bar 
be you the gentlewoman in who house 
the murder be commit 

yes my lord 

that worthy attribute of gentry which 
your habit draw from ignorant respect 
your name deserve not nor yourself the name 
of woman since you be the poison that 
infect the honour of all womanhood 

my lord I be a gentlewoman yet I must confess my poverty compel my life to a condition low than my birth or breed 

tush we know your birth 

but under colour to profess the sale 
of tire and toy for gentlewoman pride 
you draw a frequentation of man wife 
to your licentious house and there abuse 
their husband 

good my lord her rent be great the good gentlewoman have no other thing to live by but her lodging so she be force to let her foreroom out to other and herself content to lie backward 

So 

here be no evidence accuse you 
for accessary to the murder yet 
since from the spring of lust which you preserve 
and nourish run the effusion of that blood 
your punishment shall come as near to death 
as life can bear it law can inflict 
too much severity upon the cause 
of such abhor effect 

receive your sentence 
your good since they be get by that mean 
which bring disease shall be turn to the use 
of hospital you cart through the street 
accord to the common shame of strumpet 
your body whip till with the loss of blood 
you faint under the hand of punishment 
then that the necessary force of want 
may not provoke you to your former life 
you shall be set to painful labour who 
penurious gain shall only give you food 
to hold up nature mortify your flesh 
and make you fit for a repentant end 

o good my lord 

no more away with they 

now monsieur snuff a man of your profession find in a place of such impiety 

I grant you the place be full of impurity so much the more need of instruction and reformation the purpose that carry i thither be with the spirit of conversion to purify their uncleanness and I hope your lordship will say the law can take hold of i for that 

no sir it can but yet give i leave 
to tell you that I hold your wary answer 
rather premeditate for excuse 
then speak out of a religious purpose 
where take you your degree of scholarship 

I be no scholar my lord to speak the sincere truth I be snuff the tallowchandler 

how come your habit to be alter thus 

my lord Belforest take a delight in the cleanness of my conversation withdraw i from that unclean life and put i in a garment fit for his society and my present profession 

his lordship do but paint a rot post 
or cover foulness fair Monsieur snuff 
back to your candlemaking you may give 
the world more light with that then either with 
instruction or the example of your life 

thus the snuff be put out

judgement my lord in what 

your judgement must resolve i in a case bring in the body nay I will have it try this be the case my lord my providence even in a moment by the only hurt of one or two or three at most and those put quick out of pain too mark i I have wise raise a competent estate to my posterity and be there not more wisdom and more charity in that then for your lordship or your father or your grandsire to prolong the torment and the rack of rent from age to age upon your poor penurious tenant yet perhaps without a penny profit to your heir be it not more wise more charitable speak 

he be distract 

how distract then you have no judgement I can give you sense and solid reason for the very least distinguishable syllable I speak since my thrist be more judicious than your grandsire why I will fain know why your lordship live to make a second generation from your father and than your father and the whole fry of my posterity extinguish in a moment not a brat leave to succeed i I will fain know that 

grief for his child death distemper he

remission for myself D'amville descend to charl 

uncivil boy thou want humanity to smile at grief why do thou cast a cheerful eye upon the object of my sorrow my dead son 

o good my lord let charity forbear 
to vex the spirit of a die man 
a cheerful eye upon the face of death 
be the true countenance of a noble mind 
for honour sake my lord molest it not 

you be all uncivil o be it not enough that he unjust have conspire with fate to cut off my posterity for he to be the heir to my possession but he must pursue i with his presence and in the ostentation of his joy laugh in my face and glory in my grief 

D'amville to show thou with what light respect 
I value death and thy insult pride 
thus like a warlike navy on the sea 
bind for the conquest of some wealthy land 
pass through the stormy trouble of this life 
and now arrive upon the arm coast 
in expectation of the victory 
who honour lie beyond this exigent 
through mortal danger with a active spirit 
thus I aspire to undergo my death 

and thus I second thy brave enterprise 
be cheerful Charlemont our life cut off 
in our young prime of year be like green herb 
wherewith we strew the hearse of our friend 
for as their virtue gather when they be green 
before they wither or corrupt be best 
so we in virtue be the best for death 
while yet we have not live to such a age 
that the increase canker of our sin 
have spread too far upon we

I will find out 

be patient and you shall 

I have bethink i of a better way nephew we must confer sir I be grow a wondrous student now o'late my wit have reach beyond the scope of nature yet for all my learning I be still to seek from whence the peace of conscience shall proceed

whether it be thy art or nature I admire thou Charlemont why thou have teach a woman to be valiant I will beg thy life my lord I beg my nephew life I will make thou my physician thou shall read philosophy to i I will find out the efficient cause of a content mind but if I can profit in it then it be no more be my physician but infuse a little poison in a potion when thou give i physic unaware to i so I shall steal into my grave without the understanding or the fear of death and that be the end I aim at for the thought of death be a most fearful torment be it not 

your lordship interrupt the course of law 

prepare to die
