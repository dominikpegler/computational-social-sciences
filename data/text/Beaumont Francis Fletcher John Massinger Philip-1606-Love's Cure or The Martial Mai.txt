Alvarez pardon 

And return 

I see he land 
at St lucre and such a general welcome 
fame as harbinger to his brave action 
have with the easy people prepare for he 
at if by his command alone and fortune 
holland with those low province that hold out 
against the archduke be again compel 
with their obedience to give up their life 
to be at his devotion 

you amaze i 
for though I have hear that when he flee from civil 
to save his life then forfeit to law 
for murder don Pedro my dear uncle 
his extreme want enforce he to take pay 
in the army sit down then before Ostena 
it be never yet report by who favour 
he dare presume to entertain a thought 
of come home with pardon 

it be our nature 
or not to hear or not to give belief 
to what we wish far from our enemy 

sir it be most certain the infanta letter 
assist by the archduke to king Philip 
have not alone secure he from the rigor 
of our castillian justice but return he 
a free man and in grace 

by what curse mean 
can such a fugitive arise unto 
the knowledge of their highness much more 
though know to stand but in the least degree 
of favour with they 

to give satisfaction 
to your demand though to praise he I hate 
can yield i small contentment I will tell you 
and true since shall I detract his worth 
it will argue want of merit in myself 
brief to pass his tedious pilgrimage 
for sixteen year a banish guiltyman 
and to forget the storm the affright the horror 
his constancy not fortune overcome 
I bring he with his little son grow man 
though it be say here he take a daughter with he 
to Ostende bloody siege that stage of war 
wherein the flower of many nation act 
and the whole christian world spectator be 
there by his son or be he by adoption 
or nature his a brave scene be present 
which I make choice to speak of since from that 
the good success of Alvarez have beginning 

so I love virtue in a enemy 
that I desire in the relation of 
this young man glorious deed you will keep yourself 
a friend to truth and it 

such be my purpose 
the town be oft assault but in vain 
to dare the prow defendant to a sally 
weary of ease don Inigo Peralta 
son to the general of our Castille force 
all arm advance within shot of their wall 
from whence the muskateer play thick upon he 
yet he brave youth as careless of the danger 
as careful of his honour draw his sword 
and wave it about his head as if 
he dare one spirit like himself to trial 
of single valour he make his retreat 
with such a slow and yet majestic pace 
as if he still call lowed dare none come on 
when sudden from a postern of the town 
two gallant horseman issue and overtake he 
the army look on yet not a man 
that dare relieve the rash adventurer 
which Lucio son to Alvarez then see 
as in the vanguard he sit brave mount 
or be it pity of the youth misfortune 
care to preserve the honour of his country 
or bold desire to get himself a name 
he make his brave horse like a whirl wind bear he 
among the combatant and in a moment 
discharge his petronel with such sure aim 
that of the adverse party from his horse 
one tumble dead then wheel round and draw 
a falchion swift as lightning he come on 
upon the other and with one strong blow 
in view of the amaze town and camp 
he strike he dead and bring Peralta off 
with double honour to himself 

it be brave 
but the success of this 

the camp receive he 
with acclamation of joy and welcome 
and for addition to the fair reward 
be a massy chain of gold give to he 
by young peralta father he be bring 
to the infanta presence kiss her hand 
and from that lady great in her goodness 
then her high birth have this encouragement 
go on youngman yet not to feed thy valour 
with hope of recompense to come from i 
for present satisfaction of what be past 
ask any thing that be fit for i to give 
and thou to take and be assure of it 

excellent princess 

And style worthy 
the heart blood nay the soul of soldier 
but what be his request 

that the repeal 
of Alvarez make plain he humble beg 
his father pardon and so move 
tell the sad story of your uncle death 
that the infanta weep and instant 
grant his suit work the archduke to it 
their letter be direct to the king 
with who they so prevail that Alvarez 
be free pardon 

it be not in the king 
to make that good 

not in the king what subject 
dare contradict his power 

in this I dare 
and will and not call his prerogative 
in question nor presume to limit it 
I know he be the master of his law 
and may forgive the forfeit make to they 
but not the injury do to my honour 
and since forget my brave uncle merit 
and many service under duke de Alva 
he suffer he to fall wrest from justice 
the powerful sword that will revenge his death 
I will fill with this astrea empty hand 
and in my just wreak make this arm the king 
my deadly hate to Alvarz and his house 
which as I grow in year have still increase 
as if it call on time to make i man 
sleep while it have no object for her fury 
but a weak woman and she talk of daughter 
but now since there be quarry worth her sight 
both in the father and his hopeful son 
I will bold cast she off and gorge her full 
with both their heart to further which your friendship 
and oath will your assistance let your deed 
make answer to i useless be all word 
till you have write performance with your sword 

go fetch my work this ruff be not well starch 
so tell the maid it have too much blow in it 
and look you that the partridge and the pullen 
have clean meat and fresh water or my mother 
be like to hear on it 

o good sir jaques help i be there ever such a hermaphrodite hear of will any wench live that shall hear and see what I do be wrought to believe that the best of a man lie under this petticoat and that a codpiece be far fit here than a pindplacket

Indeed you have cause to love those wanton motion 
they have hope you to a excellent whip 
for do something I but put you in mind of it 
with the indian maid the governor send my mother 
from Mexico 

why I but teach she a spanish trick in charity and help the king to a subject that may live to take grave Maurice prisoner and that be more good to the state than a thousand such as you be ever like to do and I will tell you in a fatherly care of the infant I speak it if he live as bless the babe in passion I remember he to your year shall he spend his time in pin paint purl and perfume as you do no he shall to the war use his spanish pike though with the danger of the lash as his father have do and when he be provoke as I be now draw his Toledo desperate as 

you will not kill i o 

I know this will silence he how he hide his eye 
if he be a wench now as he seem what a advantage 
have I draw two Toledo when one can do this 
but o i my lady I must put up young master 
I do but jest o custom what have thou make of he 

for bring this be still my friend no more

o happy thou Lazarillo be the cause of other man wit as in thy own live lean and witty still oppress not thy stomach too much gross feeder great sleeper great sleeper fat body fat body lean brain no Lazarillo I will make thou immortal change thy humanity into deity for I will teach thou to live upon nothing 

faith signior I be immortal then already or very near it for I do live upon little or nothing belike that be the reason the poet be say to be immortal for some of they live upon their wit which be indeed as good as little or nothing but good master let i be mortal still and let we go to supper 

be abstinent show not the corruption of thy generation he that feed shall die therefore he that feed not shall live 

I but how long shall he live there be the question 

as long as he can without feed do thou read of the miraculous maid in Flanders 

no nor of any maid else for the miracle of virginity now adays cease ere the virgin can read virginity 

she that live three year without any other sustenance than the smell of a rose 

I hear of her signior but they say her gut shrink all into lutestring and her netherparts cling together like a serpent tail so that though she continue a woman still above the girdle beneath yet she be monster 

so be most woman believe it 

nay all woman signior that can live only upon the smell of a rose

he will make Vulcan your godfather by and by 

yet I say Saturn be a crabbed blockhead and Vulcan a limp hornhead for Venus his wife be a strumpet and Mars beget all her child therefore however thy original must of necessity spring from bastardy further what can be a more deject spirit in man than to lay his hand under every one horse foot to do he service as thou do for thou I will be brief thou do botch and not mend thou be a hider of enormity viz scab chilblain and kibe heel much prone thou be to sect and heresy disturb state and government for how can thou be a sound member in the commonwealth that be so subject to stitch in the ankle blush and be silent then o you mechanic compare no more with the politic cobbler for cobbler in old time have prophesy what may they do now then that have every day wax better and better have we not the length of every man foot be we not daily mender yea and what mender not horsemender
