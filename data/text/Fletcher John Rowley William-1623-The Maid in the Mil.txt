Come follow i etc 

o Diego the don be not so sweet when he perfume the steeple exeunt 

why how now friend thou be not lose again 

not lose why all the world be a wilderness 
some place people more by brave beast 
than other be but face face man 
may a man be catch with face 

without wonder 
it be odds against he may not a good face 
lead a man about by the nose alas 
the nose be but a part against the whole 

but be it possible that two face 
shall be so twine in form complexion 
figure aspect that neither wen nor mole 
the table of the brow the eye lustre 
the lip cherry neither the blush nor smile 
shall give the one distinction from the other 
do nature work in mould 

altogether 
we be all one mould one dust 

thy reason be mouldy 
I speak from the form thou the matter 
why be it not ever one of nature glory 
nay her great piece of wonder that among 
so many million millons of her work 
she leave the eye distinction to cull out 
the one from other yet all one name the face 

you must compare they by some other part 
of the body if the face can do it 

do ask her name 

yes and who give it she 
and what they promise more beside a spoon 
and what apostle picture she be christen too 
in token wherefore she be call Isabel 
the daughter of a country plowswain by 
if this be not true she lie 

she can 
it will be see a blister on her lip 
shall falsehood touch it it be so tender 
have her name hold it have be Ismenia 
and not another of her name 

shall I speak 

yes if thou will speak truth be she not wondrous like 

as two garment of the same fashion 
cut from the same piece yet if any excel 
this have the first and in my judgement it be so 

it be my opinion 

be it the face 
where my eye shall dwell I will please both 
with this as soon as one with the other 

and yet the other be the case of this 
have I not look upon Ismenia 
I never have stay beyond goodmorrow time 
in view of this 

will I can leave he here 
it be a free passage to Ismenia 
I must now blow as to put out the fire 
yet kindle it more you not consider sir 
the great disparity be in their blood 
estate and fortune there be the rich beauty 
which this poor homeliness be not endow with 
there be difference enough 

the least of all 
equality be no rule in love grammar 
that sole unhappiness be leave to prince 
to marry blood we be free disposer 
and have the power to equalise their blood 
up to our own we can keep it back 
it be a due debt from we 

I sir have you 
no father nor uncle nor such hinderer 
you may do with yourself at your pleasure 
but as it be 

as it be it be nothing

come to our enemy hand where neither part 
will ever give consent to it 

most certain 
for which reason it must not be put to they 
have we not prevention in our own hand 
shall I walk by the tree desire the fruit

I will tell the doctrine of my vision 
say that Antonio best of thy blood 
or any one the least ally to thou 
shall be the prey unto lisauro sword 
or any of the house of Bellides 

i be the just inversion on on 

how will thy eye have empty thou in sorrow 
and leave the condiment of nature dry 
thy hand have turn rebellious to the ball 
and break the glass with thy own curse 
have tear thy soul leave thou a statue 
to propagate thy next posterity 

yes and thou causer so it say to i 
they fight but your mischief the young man be friend 
as be the life and blood coagulate 
and curd in one body but this be you 
a inheritance that you have gather for they 
a legacy of blood to kill each other 
throughout your generation be it not so

so far as a love epistle come to 
that Antonio your nephew and my daughter 
Ismenia be very good friend before we 

that be a double wall about our house 
which I can wish be build 

I have it 
from Antonio intimate don Martin 
and yet methinks it be no friendly part 
to show it i 

perhaps it be his consent 
lover have policy as well as statesman 
they look not always at the mark they aim at 

we will take up cudgel and have one bout with they 
they shall know nothing of this union 
and till they find themselves most desperate 
succour shall never see they 

I will take your part sir 

it grow late there be a happy day past we 

the example I hope to all behind it exeunt 

stand fair light of love which epithet and place 
add to thou honour to i it will be shame 
we must be weight in love no grain too light 
thou be the landmark but if love be blind 
as many that can see have so report 
what benefit can thou be to his darkness 
love be a jewel some say inestimable 
but hang at the ear deprive our own sight 
and so it shine to other not ourselves 
I speak my skill I have only hear on it 
but I can wish a near document 
alas the ignorant desire to know 
some say love be but a toy and with a but 
now methinks I shall love it never the worse 
a toy be harmless sure and may be play with 
it seldom go without his adjunct pretty 
a pretty toy we say it be meet to joy too 
well here may be a mad night yet for all this 
here be a priest ready and a lady ready 
a chamber ready and a bed ready 
it be then but make unready and that be soon do 
my lady be my cousin ay myself 
which be near then my desire be i 
say they be she too be it a hanging matter 
it may be venture in a worse cause 
I must go question with my conscience 
I have the word centinel do thou stand
