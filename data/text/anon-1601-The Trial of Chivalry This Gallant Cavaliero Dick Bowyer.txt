that be prince Navarre Pembroke his plume be azure

Orange tawny and azure all be one all be but feather there be no difference I be sure but in colour 

why that be as much as may be be it not 

not so I will prove the contrary you be fair and I be foul be that all the difference between you and I there be another thing in it if you mark it well

I be not sir alone nor do I starve 
my appetite with any wilful fast 
I have a banquet of sweet please thought 
that be more precious than the costly feast 

but at your father board there sit a guest 
to who the cup of Ganymede will seem 
but juice of hemlock and the dainty dish 
as much unsavoury as the pumice stone 
unless your presence season his delight 

I be sorry I want skill to serve his diet 
I have not be instruct to such end 

but I will teach you madam if you please 

rather the party grieve first shall show 
wherein we err else how can we discern 
what be our fault or how we may amend 

that office he commit unto my tongue 

be he not able then to speak himself 

yes madam I have hear when Ferdinand 
with who in Padua I be conversant 
so speak in the assembly of the learn 
with such a grace and well compose phrase 
as many thought grave Tully eloquence 
flow like a honey river from his lip 

he want then belike sufficient courage 

never live knight less prejudice in that 
then valiant Ferdinand who I have see 
couch his staff lance with such dexterity 
as if the god of battle have himself 
enter the list and press to the midst 
of steelcomposed troop like lightning fly 
till he have make a passage with his sword 

so puissant in his fortitude with man 
and daunt with a silly woman look 
how can that be 

yes when you weigh the force 
of your resistless and control beauty 
it be your beauty be his power and spirit 
ten time more haughty venturous then it be 
compel it stoop in homage to your foot 
as tremble lamb when they to lion couch 

it be well he choose so good a orator 
to plead the imperfection of his cause 

I shall have that opinion of myself 
if for my sake your grace will favour he 

yes for your sake we have endure his name 
and for your sake we tolerate his suit 
but when you cease to speak than all that praise 
you have attribute to his desert 
seem borrow from yourself you be the man 
who eloquence compare with Cicero 
you be the man who knightly fortitude 
live in the world unprejudiced of any 
you vanquish beauty and enthral the mind 
of female weakness with no lesser awe 
then indian vassal stoop unto their lord 
the name of Ferdinand you have mistake 
say it be yourself and then your whole discourse 
observe the perfect method that it shall 

shall I be false and treacherous to my friend 
I be entreat but to speak for he 

but for yourself will be more acceptable 
o pardon i nor let immodest strain 
cleave to my brow my love be chaste breed 
other than Pembroke Katherine never vow 
shall be enthronize in her maiden thought 

mistake i not I say it be Ferdinand 
die in affection to your deity 

but in affection I survive to none 
but only Pembroke 

will you be esteem 
a cruel murderess of a loyal friend 

will Pembroke triumph in a woman fall 

you anger i respect young Ferdinand 

you please i not to speak of Ferdinand 

nay then it be time to go or wrong my friend 
since madam what I will I can do 
my honour here bid i leave off to woo

but madam spite his heart you shall see this 

give i his picture image far more kind 
then be the substance whence thou be derive 
which way soever I divert myself 
thou seem to follow with a love eye 
thou will I therefore hold within my arm 
as some small comfort to increase harm 

what mean my second self by this long stay 
I can rest till I be certify 
what good or bad success my suit return 
but he be go and in fair Katherine hand 
I see his picture what may this pretend 

thou have do well indeed in every part 
thou show complete and cunning workmanship 
his eye his lip his cheek be right frame 
but one thing thou have gross overslip 
where be his stubborn unrelenting heart 
that lurk in secret as his master do 
disdain to regard or pity i 

madam his heart must be imagine 
by the description of the outward part 

o no for then it will be tractable 
mild and applausive as the other be 

no prince but Pembroke dwell in Katherine eye 
who be that disturb our please solitude 

know you not i my name be Ferdinand 
who faithful love lord Pembroke late commence 

speak then for Pembroke as he do for you

then shall I breathe forth his passion not my own 
ay ay it be so the villain in my name 
have purchase her affection for himself 
and therefore be he absent from the feast 
and therefore shun my sight and leave behind

to serve she in all loyalty of heart 
to reverence and adore her very name 
to be content to kiss the lowly earth

what homage be it thou require of we 

first to acknowledge he lie bury here 
the faithful lover and most valiant knight 
that in this time draw sword or manage horse 

and what be he a scapart or your countryman Gargantua that stuff every button of his coat with a load of hay 'Sheart we have i a fellow here be all mouth he speak nothing but monarch do thou hear king give i leave to encounter this puckfist and if I do not make he cry peccavi say Dick Bowyer be a powder mackerel 

my blood begin to boil I can be please 
to have this fellow by the ear but that 
there be many of my better here in place 

king of Navarre let Flanders cope with he 

imperial France give Bourbon leave to try 
the hazard of a combat with this boaster 

dispatch Navarre one of you come forth 
to interchange a warlike blow or two 

first let we know what penalty thou set 
upon thyself if thou be vanquish 

a recantation of my former word 
a servitude to he that conquer i 
but whosoever be by i subdue 
must leave his shield to beautify this shrine 

let not Navarre my lord rob we of honour 
say Bourbon first shall break a lance with he 

a scribe that privilege my lord to i 
and Rodorick will have death or victory 

no noble Rodorick Bourbon shall begin 
and as he speed we will employ your power 

provide thou Bourbon I will not favour thou 

be sure he show thou like hostility 

hold the advantage be on thy side 
the duke of Bourbon shall hang up his shield 

I will rather have his life than all your shield

now Rodorick betake you to your task

since all miscarry France will put his chance 
upon the hazard of the dice for once 

you be a honourable foe my lord 
by law of arm you must hang up your shield 

I yield to law and thy approve valour 
king of Navarre will only you sit out 

no king of France my blood be as hot as thou 
and this my weapon shall confirm my word 

Navarre down too 'Sheart this fellow have the trick of it 
if he be not a witch or some devil let i be 
stick into a carbinado 

thou son of chivalry let i now entreat 
to know his name for who thou reap this honour 
or what he be who body be here inter 

a valiant knight his name young Ferdinand 
slay by misfortune of a friendly hand 

be it my son thou make thy valour prize 
and strive so to eternize with thy sword 
let i embrace thou not alone my shield 
but I will leave my heart upon his shrine 
my dear Ferdinand I will my sigh 
or sad lament tear may have the power 
like balm to quicken thy benumb joint 
then will I drown this marble ere I go 
and heat it hot with vapour of my breath 

Navarre this now may testify thy wrong 
in false accuse i for his remove 

thou may be guilty still for aught I know 
for though I find he dead I find not yet 
the tragic manner of his hapless end 
thou may as well have murder Ferdinand 
as favour he have poison Bellamira 

injurious king it be base Ferdinand 
on who just heaven have show just vengeance here 
ravish my Katherine and convey she hence 
where I shall never more behold her face 

it be false and we will maintain it with our sword 

it be true and we will maintain it with our sword 

by heaven the tongue profane the sacred name 
of Ferdinand with any villainy 
I will cut it out or stop his throat with blood 
and so dam in his blasphemous upbraid 

content thou knight I will case thou of that labour 
tomorrow be expire the time of truce 
France on with thy battalion to the plain 
thou be prepare before to pitch upon 
I will meet thou there 

and I will meet with thou 
sound drum and trumpet honour knight farewell 
who shall survive next morn strange news shall tell 

thus heady rage blind in her rash resolve 
draw Ferdinand and i into the field 
as now it do these hot incense king 
be it not my vow prohibit my desire 
to stay the inconvenience of this fight 
I will discover where their daughter be 
to show the error they be shroud in 
but time have run a desperate course with i 
and desperate let they run to misery 
here come a straggler of their army stand 

what voice be that presume to bid i stand 

his that can force thou if thou will not stand 

by this bright air reflect on my sword 
if the whole army of Navarre have say 
as much to fillip yet he will not stand 
and thou but one how dare thou proffer it 
know how sharp a spur do prick i on 
the death of Bourbon for my Bellamire 

hang up thy shield as other knight have do 
upon the hearse of noble Ferdinand 
and thou may free pass without control 

the hearse of Ferdinand I honour he 
he be the brother of my dear love 
what be this I see my father batter shield 
the shield of France of Flaunders Bourbon too 
it can not then impeach or prejudice 
the name of Philip to consort with such 
especial be do for Ferdinand 
there be my shield and knight but for my haste 
I will expostulate of other thing 
but after traitorous Bourbon I have slay 
knight look for i I will visit thou again 
now Rodorick keep thy word and I be bless 
but if thou fail I will forward with the rest 

successful action sit upon thy sword 
this net of sorrow I perceive entangle 
not only Pembroke but the court of France 
Navarre and his associate be all touch 
time look upon we and at last determine 
this heartdissevering tumult with a peace 

since Ferdinand by gracious providence 
thou be recover of thy mortal wound 
with the new life thy body be reviude 
revive the ancient passion of thy mind 
think on thy friend on Pembroke take remorse 
who honour life thy hasty hand cut off 
this be the place as I remember i 
what be here a tomb who have prevent i 
in my religious duty to my friend

what be thou stand 

a knight and fain will know 
what sacred monument and tomb this be 

his while he live that of the world increase 
be the most loyal friend and valiant knight 
which thou must likewise ratify with i 
and hang thy shield up to adorn his hearse 
or venture combat for deny it 

his name I pray thou 

Ferdinand 

what be he acquaint with my name belike some one 
love Pembroke and suppose wrongful 
i slay by he to satisfy for that 
observe this honour in my memory 
be not thou Ferdinand ingrateful then 
but stand for Pembroke as this knight for thou 

what answer give thou shall I homage have 

not for his sake thou name not for Ferdinand 
there live a knight excel his petty fame 
as far as costly pearl the course pebble 
a english knight call Pembroke be his bone 
inter here I will confess of he 
much more than thou require and be content 
to hang both shield and sword upon his hearse 

how come this stranger by my name belike 
he be affect unto Ferdinand 
and for his sake hear he do i wrong 
covet to make amends or mean to prove 
if I embrace he with unfeigned love 
he shall not doubt of that once more I say 
it be Ferdinand be the renown knight 
of all the world 

but I deny that say 
give to Pembroke that preeminence 

for Ferdinand my valour will I try 

in Pembroke valour I will fight and die 

either I dream or this be Ferdinand 

my sight delude i or stout Pembroke life 

thrice happy honour I do embrace my friend 

welcome o welcome Pembroke to my arm 
who I imagine death have take from i 

the like do I by princely Ferdinand 
but that he live my soul confound with joy 

tell i dear friend since our unlucky fight 
have you hear aught of my disdainful love 

of she and all the rest her father live 
this be his shield and this be great Navarre 
this Rodorick the duke of Orleans 
and this malicious Bourbon all the which 
I force from they to beautify thy shrine 
but it be of Katherine thou desire to hear 
she likewise have be here her flinty heart 
so much before incline to cruelty 
now wax tender she no soon see 
thy picture here but by heaven providence 
or how I know not she so dote on it 
as I suppose she will have die for love 

have then my shadow and suppose death 
bring that to pass my live substance can not 

it have and never lady more enamour 
then now be Katherine of her Ferdinand 
I tell she and no more than truth I tell 
a cunning carver have cut out thy shape 
and whole proportion in white alabaster 
which I intend here shall be set up 
she earnest entreat she may have 
a sight of it and daily be permit 
to deck thy tomb and statue with sweet flower 
she be but even now depart to that end 
and will I know be quick here again 
now for assurance I dissemble not 
instead of thy resemblance cut in stone 
kneel here thyself and hear her piteous moan 

content I hold your counsel for the best 
we will once conclude our sorrow with a jest 

soft there be a cushion nay you must be bare 
and hold your hand up as the manner be 

what if I hold a book as if I pray 

it be best of all and now I think upon it 
here be a book so keep your countenance 
you must imagine now you be transform 
yonder she come in any case stir not 

I fear I have detract time too long 
in my determine service to my love 
but I will redeem my fault with double care 
see where his statue be set up kind knight 
for ever Katherine will record thy truth 

How say you madam be it not very like he 

as like as if it be himself indeed 
and will to God my prayer may be hear 
that as the image of Pygmalion once 
life may descend into this senseless stone 
but that be feign as my desire be fond 
relentless death withhold my Ferdinand 
and no entreaty may recover he 
in token then I do repent my scorn 
that I be cruel to so kind a friend 
thou the presenter of his absent person 
receive these sweet thy temple be adorn 
with this fresh garland thy white ivory hand 
boast of this ring which if thou be alive 
shall bind our faith up in a nuptial knot 
but for thou can not be revive again 
I will dwell with thou in death and as my spirit 
mount to the happy mansion of thy spirit 
so to accompany thy shadow here 
I will turn my body to a shadow too 
and kneel thus confront thy silent look 
with my sad look this be the instrument 
now Ferdinand behold thy Katherine come 

and she be welcome unto Ferdinand 

I will play the clerk for both and say amen 
nay muse not madam it be no senseless image 
but the true essence of your wish love 

I be ashamed to look he in the face 

hide not those splendent light hereafter be 
a constant wife it shall suffice for i

of that no more now let we haste from hence 
to quiet the dissension late spring 
between your parent Philip likewise go 
to be revenge on Bourbon treachery 
perhaps may stand in need of friendly aid 
to he and they our vow must next be pay
