and which I must confess be all on fire 
we cry for war and death back ride the herald 
as lightning have pursue he but the captain 
think we tire with march do conceive 
rest will make difficult what easy now 
quick charge may drive we too 
so like a storm beat upon a wood of lusty pine 
which though they shake they keep their foot fast 
our pike their horse stand hot be the day 
in which whole field of man be sweep away 
as by sharp scythe be cut the golden corn 
and in as short time it be this man sword 
hew way to danger and when danger meet he 
he charm it thence and when it grow again 
he drive it back again till at the length 
it lose the field four long hour this do hold

of war harsh harmony have long besiege

and be as ready to receive a blessing from he 
as you his chaste embrace 

So so bestir

in our most diligent and active care enter bellizarius 
here come my comfortbringer 
my bellizarius 

dear victoria 
my second joy take thou a father blessing 

not wound sir I hope

those be reward that we bestow on other 
we give but take none back have we not you 
at home to hear our noble victory 
our fame shall want her crown although she fly 
as high as yonder axletree above 
and spread in latitude throughout the world 
we have subdue those man of strange belief 
which Christian call themselves a race of people 
this must I speak of they as resolute 
and full of courage in their bleed fall 
as shall they triumph for a victory 
when the last groan of many thousand meet 
and like commix whirlwind fill our ear 
as it from we raise not a dust of pity 
so do it give no terror to the rest 
that do but live to see their fellow die 
in all our rigour and afflict torture 
we can say that we the man subdue 
because their joy be loud than our conquest 
and still more work of blood we must expect 
like Hydra head by cut off they double 
as seed that multiply such be their dead 
next moon a sheaf of Christian in one stead 

this be a bloody trade my bellizarius 
will thou will give it over 

it be work Victoria that must be do 
these be the battle of our blessing 
please god and goddess who for our service 
render we these conquest 
ourselves and our affair we may neglect 
but not our deity which these Christian profane 
deride and scoff at will new law 
bring in and a new god make 

no my lord 
I have hear say they never make their god 
but they serve they they say that do make they 
all madegod they despise 

tush tush Victoria let not thy pity 
turn to passion they will not deserve thy sorrow 
how now what be the news 

strange my lord beyond a wonder 
for it be miraculous since you forsake 
the bloody fight and horror of the Christian 
one torture wretch who sight be quite extinct 
his eye no far see than his hand 
be now by that Eugenius who they call 
their holy bishop clear restore again 
to the astonishment of all your army 
who faint now recoil with fear and terror 
not dare to offend so great a power 

ha it be strange thou tell i 

o take heed my lord 
it be no war against heavenly power 
who can command their conquest when they please 
they can forbear the giant that throw stone 
and smile upon their folly but when they frown 
their anger fall down perpendicular 
and strike their weak opposer into nothing 
the thunder tell we so 

pray leave i all I shall have company 
when you be go enough to fill the room 

the holy power 
give thou their best direction exeunt Manet bellizarius 

what power be that can fortify a man 
to joy in death since all that we expect 
be but fruition of the joy of life 
if Christian hope not to become immortal 
why shall they seek for death 
o then instruct i some divine power 
thou that can give the sight unto the blind 
open my blind judgement thunder 
that I may see a way to happiness enter a angel 
ha this be a dreadful answer this may chide 
the relapse in my blood that begin to faint 
the further persecution of these people 
or shall I back and double tyranny thunder 
a loud threaten o mould these voice 
into articulate word that I may know 
thy meaning better shall I quench the flame 
of blood and vengeance and myself become 
a penetrable christian my life lay down 
among their suffering music 
ha these be sweet tune 

bellizarius 

it name i too 

sheath up thy cruelty no more pursue 
in bloody forage these oppress Christian 
for now the thunder will take their part 
remain in peace and music be thy banquet 
or thyself number among their martyr groan 
and thou be number with these bless one 

what heavenly voice be this shall my ear only 
be leave with rapture not my eye enjoy 
the sight of that celestial presence 
from whence these sweet sound come 

yes thou shall see nay then it be lose again Bel kneel 
rise this be enough be constant soldier 
thy heart be a Christian to death persevere 
and then enjoy the sight of angel ever Exit 

o let i fly into that happy place 
prepare your torture now you scourge of Christian 
for bellizarius the christian torturer 
centuple all that ever I have do 
kindle the fire and hack at once with sword 
tear i by piecemeal strangle and extend 
my every limb and joint nay devise more 
than ever do my bloody tyranny 
o let i ever lose the sight of man 
that I may see a angel once again 

for look you Damianus though Henrick now king 
do in the battle well and bellizarius enough for 
a general do not I tell they home 

I hear it 

they shall not make bonfire of their own glory 
and set up for i a poor wax candle 
to show i I be full of gold now 
what shall I do with it Damianus 

what do mariner after boon voyage 
but let all fly 
and what soldier when war be do 
but fatten peace 

pox of peace she have churl enough to fatten she 
I will make i a chamois doublet embroider 
all over with flower of gold in these day 
a woman will not look upon a man 
if he be not brave over my doublet a 
soldado cassock of scarlet lard thick with 
gold lace hose of the same cloak of the same too 
lash up this high and rich line 
there be a lady before I go be work 
with her needle a scarf for i 
but the wagtail have leave her nest 

no matter there be enough such bird everywhere 

yes woman be as common as glass in tavern 
and often drink in and more often crack 
I shall grow lazy if I fight not 
I will fain play with half a dozen fencer 
but it shall be at sharp 

and they be all for foil 

foil let they be then 

you have fence enough in the field and for woman 
the christian field your market 

yes and those market be our shambles flesh enough 
it make i weary of it since I come home 
I have be wondrous trouble in my sleep 
and often hear to sigh in dead of night 
as if my heart will crack you talk of Christian 
I will tell you a strange thing a kind of melt in 
my soul as it be before some heavenly fire 
when in their death who they themselves call martyr 
it be all rocky nothing they say can soften 
a diamond but goat blood they perhaps wete lamb 
in who blood I be soften 

pray tell how 

I will after some three hour be in Carthage 
I rush into a temple star all with light 
which with my draw sword rifle in a room 
hang full of picture draw so full of sweetness 
they strike a reverence in i find I a woman 
a lady all in white the very candle 
take brightness from her eye and those clear pearl 
which in abundance fall on her cheek 
give they a lovely bravery at my rough entrance 
she shriek and kneel and hold up a pair 
of ivory finger hand beg that I will not 
though I do kill dishonour she and tell i 
she will pray for i never do Christian 
so near come to my heartstring I let my sword 
fall from i stand astonish and not only 
save she myself but guard she from other 

do like a soldier 

blood be not ever 
the wholsome wine to drink doubtless these Christian 
serve some strange master and it need must be 
a wonderful sweet wage which he pay they 
and though man murmur get they once here foot 
then down go our religion down our altar 
and strange thing be set up I can tell 
we hold so pure find way enough to hell 
fall out what can I care not I will to bellizarius 

will you pray carry to he my best wish 

I can carry any thing but blow coal my drink and that clapper of the devil the tongue of a scold farewell exeunt 

they swarm like bee about we insomuch 
our people can sacrifice nor give incense 
but with interruption they still be buzz thus 
say their god delight not in vain show 
but intellectual thought pure and unstained 
therefore reduce they from their heresy 
or build our prison wall with Christian bone 
what think our bellizarius he that be wont 
to be more swift to execute than we to command 
why sit not bellizarius 

I dare not 

protect i jove 
who dare gain say it 

I must not 

say we command it 

truth be I neither can nor will

to see such wolvish tyrant as you be 
pretend a justice and condemn the just 
o you white soul that hover in the air 
who through my blindness be make death prey 
be but appease you spotless innocent 
till with my blood I have make a true atonement 
and through those torture by this brain devise 
in which you perish I may fall as you 
to satisfy your yet fresh bleed memory 
and meet you in that garden where content 
dwell only that in blood do glory 
will now spend blood to heighten out your story 

why bellizarius

nor be deter by mole and worm that can see 
such as you be alas I pity you

Come you must to the king

I scarce can go 

wirewhip shall drive you 
the king be counsel for his health to bathe he 
in the warm blood of Christian and you I think 
must give he ease 

willing my fetter 
hang now methinks like feather at my heel 
on any whither I can run sir 

can you not very far I fear 

no wind my faith shake nor rock split in sunder 
the poor ship toss here my strong anchor vbz yonder exeunt 

my lord 

ha 

afraid in a close room where no foe come 
unless it be a weasel or a rat 
and those besiege your larder or your pantry 
who the arm foe never fright in the field 

it be true my lord there danger be a safety here 
to be secure I think most dangerous 
or what can famine wound or all the extreme 
that still attend a soldier action 
can not destroy one syllable from a king breath 
can thus thus easy win 

o it be their long observe policy 
to turn away these roar boy 
when they intend to rock licentious thought 
in a soft room where every long cushion be 
embroider with old history of peace 
and all the hang of war thrust into the wardrobe 
till they grow musty or motheaten 

one of those rusty monument be I 

a little oil of favour will scour thou again 
and make thou shine as bright as in that day 
we win the famous battle against the Christian 

never Hubert never enter Bellina and kneel weep 
what news now girl 
thy heart so great it can tell i 

'sfoot why shall thou be trouble 
that be thus visit 
let the king put i into any room 
the close the better and turn but such a keeper to i 
and if ever I strive to run away though the door be open 
may the virgin curse destroy i 
and let i lamentable and most unmanly 
dye of the greensickness 

my blessing bring thou patience gentle girl 
it be the best thy wrong father can 
invoke for thou it be my Bellina Hubert 
know her honour sir and pity she 

how sweet she become the face of woe 
Shee teach misery to court her beauty 
and to affliction lend a lovely look happy folk 
will sell their blessing for her grief 
but to be sure to meet they thus 

my honour father your grieve daughter thus 
thrice every day to heaven lift her poor hand 
and pay her vow to the incense power 
for your release and happy patience 
and will grow old in vow unto those power 
till they fall on i load with my wish 

thou be the comfort of my treasure girl 
we will live together if it please the king 
and tell sad story of thy wretched mother 
give equal sigh to one another grief 
and by discourse of happiness to come 
trample upon our present misery 

there be a violent fire run round about i 
which my sigh blow to a consume flame 
to be her martyr be a happiness 
the saint soul will change their merit for it 
methinks grief dwell about her pure eye 
as if it beg a pardon for those tear 
exhaust hence and only due to love 
her veil hang like a cloud over her face 
through which her beauty like a glimmer star 
give a transparent lustre to the night 
as if no sorrow can eclipse her light 
her lip as they discourse methinks look pale 
for fear they shall not kiss again but meet 
they blush for joy as happy lover do 
after a long divorce when they encounter 

noble lord if you dare lose so much precious time 
as to be companion to my misery but one poor hour 
and not esteem yourself too prodigal 
for that expense this wretched maid my child 
shall wait upon you with her sorrow story 
vouchsafe but you to hear it 

yes with full ear 

to your best thought I leave you Exit Belliz 
I will but read and answer this my letter 

why do you seem to lose your eye on i 
here be nothing but a pile of wretchedness 
a branch that every way be shake at root 
and will I think even fall before you now 
but that divinity which prop it up 
inspire it full of comfort since the cause 
my father suffer for give a full glory 
to his base fetter of captivity 
and I beseech you sir if there but dwell 
so much of virtue in you as your look 
seem to express possess your honour thought 
bestow your pity on we not your scorn 
and wish for goodness sake and your soul weal 
you be a sharer in these suffering 
so the same cause expose your fortune to it 

o happy woman know I suffer more 
and for a cause as just 

be proud then of that triumph but I be yet 
a stranger to the character of what 
you say you suffer for 
be it for conscience 

for love divine perfection 

if of heaven love how rich be your reward 

of heaven best blessing your most perfect self 

Alas sir here perfection keep no court 
love dress here no wanton amorous bower 
sorrow have make perpetual winter here 
and all my thought be icy past the reach 
of what love fire can thaw 

o do but take away a part of that 
my breast be full of of that holy fire 
the queen of love fair altar hold not pure 
nor more effectual and sweet if then 
you melt not into passion for my wound 
effuse your virgin vow to chain my ear 
weep on my neck and with your fervent sigh 
infuse a soul of comfort into i 
I will break the altar of the foolish god 
proclaim they guilty of idolatry 
that sacrifice to Cytherea son 

do not my present fortune and my vow 
register in the record of heaven 
tie i too strict from such thought as these 
I fear i I shall soft yield to what 
my yet condition have be strange to 
to love my lord be to be miserable 

o to thy sweetness envy will prove kind 
tormentor humble no pale murderer 
and the page of death a smile courtier 
Venus must then to give thou noble welcome 
perfume her temple with the breath of nun 
not Vesta but her own with rose strew 
the path that bring thou to her bless shrine 
clothe all her altar in her rich robe 
and hang her wall with story of such love 
have raise her triumph and above all at last 
record this day the happy day in which 
Bellina prove to love a convertite 
be merciful and save i 

you be defile with sea of Christian blood 
a enemy to heaven and which be good 
and can be a love friend to i 

if I have sin forgive i you just power 
my ignorance not cruelty have do it 
and here I vow myself to be hereafter 
whatever Bellina shall instruct i in 
for she be never make but to possess 
the high mansion among your dignity 
nor can heaven let she err 

on that condition thus I spread my arm 
who chaste embrace never touch man before 
and will to Hubert all the favour show 
his virtuous love can covet 
I will be ever he go thou to war 
these hand shall arm thou and I will watch thy tent 
till from the battle thou bring victory 
in peace I will sit by thou and read or sing 
stanza of chaste love of love purify 
from desire drossy blackness nay when our cloud 
of ignorance be quite vanish and that a holy 
religious knot between we may be tie 
Bellina here vow to be Hubert bride 
else do I swear perpetual chastity 

thy vow I seal be thou my ghostly tutor 
and all my action level to thy thought 
I be thy creature 

let heaven too but now propitious prove 
and for thy soul thou have win a happy love 
Come shall we to my father exeunt 

be you physician 
be you those man that proud call yourselves 
the help of nature 

o my good lord have patience 

what shall I do lie like a patient ass 
feel myself torture by this diffuse poison 
but torture more by these unsavoury drug 

Come one of you yourselves and speak to he 

how fare your highness 

never worse what be he 

one of your highnessdoctor 

Come sit near i 
feel my pulse once again and tell i doctor 
tell i in term that I may understand 
I do not love your gibberish tell i honest 
where the cause lie and give a remedy 
and that with speed or in despite of art 
of nature you and all your heavenly motion 
I will recollect so much of life into i 
as shall give space to see you torture 
somebody tell i that a bath of man blood 
will restore i Christian shall pay for it 
fetch the bishop hither he shall begin 

he be go for 

what be my disease 

my lord you be poison 

I tell thou so myself and tell thou how 
but what be the reason that I have no help 
the coffer of my treasury be full 
or if they be not tributary christian 
bring in sufficient store to pay your fee 
if that you gape at 

will please your highness then to take this cordial 
gold never true do you good till now 

it be go 

my lord it be the perfect tincture 
of gold that ever any art produce 
with it be mix a true rare quintessence 
extract out of oriental bezoar 
and with it be dissolve the magisterial 
make of the horn Armenia so much boast of 
which though dull death have usurp nature right 
be able to create new life again 

why do it good on man and not on king 
we have the selfsame passage for nature 
with mortal man our pulse beat like they 
we be subject unto passion as they be 
I find it now but to my grief I find 
life stand not with we on such ticklish point 
what be it because we be king life take it leave 
with great state no no the envious god 
malign our happiness o that my breath have power 
with my last word to blast their deity 

the cordial that you take require rest 
for health sake good my lord repose yourself 

yes any thing for health draw round the curtain 

we will watch by he while you two do consult 

what guess you by that urine 

sure death 

death certain without contradiction 
for though the urine be a whore and lie 
yet where I find she in all part agree 
with other symptom of apparent death 
I will give her faith pray sir do but mark 
these black hypostasis it plain show 
mortification general through the spirit 
and you may find the pulse to show as much 
by his uncertainty of time and strength 

we find the spirit often sophisticated 
by many accident but yet not mortify 
a sudden fear will do it 

very right 
but there be no malicious humour mix 
as in the king sir you must understand 
a scorpion sting he now a scorpion be 
a small compact creature in who earth 
have the predominance but mix with fire 
so that in he Saturn and Mars do meet 
this little creature have his several humour 
and these their excrement these meet together 
inflame by anger make a deadly poison 
and by how much the creature body be less 
by so much be the force of venom more 
as lightning through a window casement 
hurt more than that which enter at the door 

but for the way to cure it 

know none 
yet ancient writer have prescribe we many 
as Theophrastus hold most excellent 
diaphoretic medicine to expel 
ill vapour from the noble part by sweat 
but Avices and also rabbi rose 
do think it better by provoke urine 
since by the urine blood may well be purge 
and spirit from the blood have nutriment 
but for my part I ever hold opinion 
in such a case the ventose be best 

they be indeed and they do far exceed 

all the great curious cataplasm 
or the live tail of a deplumed hen 
or your hot pigeon or your quarter whelp 
for they by a mere force attractive power 
retain that safe which by force be draw 
whereas the other thing I name before 
do lose their virtue as they lose their heat 

the ventose shall be our next intention 

pray gentleman attend his highness 

your next intention be to drown yourselves 
dogleech all I see I be not mortal 
for I with patience have thus long endure 
beyond the strength of all mortality 
but now the thrice heat furnace of my bosom 
disdain bound do not I scorch you all 
go go you be all but prate mountebank 
quacksalver and impostor get you all from i 

these ventose my lord will give you ease 

a vengeance on thy ventose and thou 

the bishop sir be come 

Christian thy blood 
must give i ease and help 

drink then thy fill 
none of the father that beget sweet physic 
that divine lady comforter to man 
invent such a medicine as man blood 
a drink so precious shall not be so spill 
take my and heaven pardon you the guilt 

a butcher see his throat cut 

I be so far from shrink that my own hand 
shall bare my throat and be so far from wish 
ill to you that mangle i that before 
my blood shall wash these rush 
king I will cure thou 

you cure he 

speak on fellow 

if I do not 
restore your limb to soundness drive the poison 
from the infect part study your torture 
to tear i piecemeal yet be keep alive 

o reverent man come near i work this wonder 
ask gold honour any any thing 
the sublunary treasure of this world 
can yield and they be thou 

I will do nothing without a recompense 

a royal one 

name what you will desire 

stand by you trouble he 
a recompense can my crown buy thou take it 
reach he my crown and plant it on his head 

no here be my bargain 

quick o speak quick

free all those Christian which be now thy slave 
in all thy citadel castle fortress

those in Alempha and in Hazaneth 
those in thy galley those in thy jail and dungeon

of christian gore

to languish in a torment that feed on i 
as if the fury bite i I will turn Christian 
and if I do not let the thunder pay 
my breach of promise cure i good old man 
and I will call thou father thou shall have 
a king come kneel to thou every morning 
to take a blessing from thou and to hear thou 
salute he as a son 
when when be this wonder 

now you be well sir

for thyself thou fool shall I allow

college of physician let he not touch i

from all our Vandal leader to be chief 
over a new army which the king will raise 
to root out from our land these Christian 
that overrun we

will raise your fame and make you like our god 
to please who you must do this 

and in do 
be active as the fire and merciless 
as be the boundless ocean when it swallow 
whole town and of they leaf no monument 

when shall my eye be happy in the sight 
of this brave pageantry 

the king say instant 

and must I be the general 

only you 

I shall not then at my return home 
have sharer in my great act to the volume 
my sword in bloody letter shall text down 
no name must stand but i no leaf turn over 
but Hubert work be read and none but i 
bellizarius shall not on his cloud of fire 
fly flame round about the stare world 
while I creep on the earth flatter i not 
be I to go indeed 

the king so swear 

a king word be a statute grave in brass 
and if he break that law I will in thunder 
rouse his cold spirit I long to ride in armour 
and look round about i to see nothing 
but sea and shore the sea of Christian blood 
the shore tough soldier here a wing fly out 
soar at victory here the main battalion 
come up with as much horror and hot terror 
as if a thickgrown forest by enchantment 
be make to move and all the tree shall meet 
pellmell and rive their beat bulk in sunder 
as petty tower do be fling down by thunder 
pray thank the king and tell he I be ready 
to cry a charge tell he I shall not sleep 
till that which wake coward tremble with fear 
startle i and send brave music to my ear 
and that be the drum and trumpet 

this shall be tell he

strong charm about my fullplumed burgonet 
to bring i safe home I must to the war 

what war we have no war but in ourselves 
we fight with our sin our sin with we 
yet they still get the victory who be in arm 
that you must to the field 

the king royal thought 
be in a mutiny among themselves 
and nothing can allay they but a slaughter 
a general massacre of all the Christian 
that breath in his dominion I be the engine 
to work this glorious wonder 

forefend it heaven 
last time you sit by i within my bower 
I tell you of a palace wall with gold 

I do remember it 

the floor of sparkle diamond and the roof 
stud with star shine as bright as fire

and I tell you one day I will show you 
a path shall bring you thither 

you do indeed

to lie in a cold field a field of murder 
Say thou shall kill ten thousand Christian

thou fall into a pit as bottomless 
as the heaven be in extension infinite 

more prithee more I have forget this music 

Say thou shall win the day yet be thou lose 
for ever lose a everlasting slave 
though thou come home a laureled conqueror 
you court i to love you now I woo thou 
to love thyself to love a thing within thou 
more curious than the frame of all this world 
more last than this engine over our head 
who wheel have move so many thousand year 
this thing be thy soul 
for which I woo thou 

thou woo I yield and in that yield love thou 
and for that love I will be the Christian guide 
I be their captain come both Goth and Vandal 
nay come the king I be the christian general 

not yet till your commission be fair draw 
not yet till on your brow you bear the print 
of a rich golden seal 

get i that seal then 

there be a aqua fortis a eat water 
must first wash off thy infidelity 
and then thou be arm 

o let i then be arm 

thou shall 
but on thy knee thou gentle first shall swear 
to put no armour on but what I bear 

by this chaste clasp of our hand I swear 

we then thus hand in hand will fight a battle 
worth all the pitchfield all the bloody banquet 
the slaughter and the massacre of Christian 
of who such heap so quick never fall 
brave on set be thy end not terrible 

this kindle fire burn in we till as death slave 
our body pay their tribute to their grave exeunt 

Come fellow pagan death mean to fare well today for he be like to have roastmeat to his supper two principal dish many a knight keep a worse table first a brave general carbonado than a fat bishop broil who rochet come in fry for the second course accord to the old say a plump greasy prelate fry a faggot dainty 

o the general bellizarius for my money he have a fiery spirit too he will roast soak within and without 

methinks Christian make the brave bonfire of any people in the universe as a jew burn prettywell but if you mark he he burn upward the fire take he by the nose first 

I know some vintner then be jew 

now as your jew burn upward your Frenchman burn downward like a candle and common go out with a stink like a snuff and what socket soever it light in it must be well cleanse and pick before it can be use again but bellizarius the brave general will flame high and clear like a beacon but your Puritan Eugenius will burn blue blue like a whitebread sop in aqua vitae fellow pagan I pray let we agree among ourselves about the share of those two 

ay it be fit 

you know I be worshipful by my place the underkeeper may write squire if he list at the bottom of the paper I do cry first the general great scarf to make i a short summercloak and the bishop wide sleeve to make i a holiday shirt 

have a double voice we can abridge you of a double share 

you that so well know what belong to reverence the breeches by you whether bishop or general but with this proviso because we will all share of both party as I have lead the way I claim the general and the bishop sleeve so he that choose the general doublet shall wear the general breeches 

a match 

nay it will be far from a match that be certain but it will make we to be take for man of note what company soever we come in 
the soldier and the scholar peek up so 
will make tam marti quam Mercurio 

as you be vicegerent to that majesty 
by who king reign on earth as you will wish 
your heir shall sit upon your throne your name 
be mention in the chronicle of glory 
great king vouchsafe i hear 

speak 

my husband 
the much too much wrong bellizarius 
have not deserve the measure of such misery 
which be throw on he call o call to mind 
his service how often he have fight 
and toil in war to give his country peace 
he have not be a flatterer of the time 
nor court great one for their glorious vice 
he have not soothe blind dotage in the world 
nor caper on the commonwealth dishonour 
he have not peel the rich nor flay the poor 
nor from the heartstring of the commons draw 
profit to his own coffer he never bribe
