RObert of artoys banish though thou be 
from France thy native country yet with we 
thou shall retain as great a signiory 
for we create thou earl of Richmond here 
and now go forward with our pedigree 
who next succeed Philip of Bew 

three son of he which all successful 
do sit upon their father regal throne 
yet die and leave no issue of their loin 

but be my mother sister unto those 

Shee be my lord and only Isabel 
be all the daughter that this Philip have 
who afterward your father take to wife 
and from the fragrant garden of her womb 
your gracious self the flower of Europe hope 
derive be inheritor to France 
but not the rancour of rebellious mind 
when thus the lineage of Bew be out 
the french obscure your mother privilege 
and though she be the next of blood proclaim 
john of the house of Valois now their king 
the reason be they say the realm of France 
replete with prince of great parentage 
ought not admit a governor to rule 
except he be descend of the male 
and that be the special ground of their contempt 
where with they study to exclude your grace 
but they shall find that forge ground of they 
to be but dusty heap of brittle sand 

perhaps it will be think a heinous thing 
that I a french man shall discover this 
but heaven I call to record of my vow 
it be not hate nor any private wrong 
but love unto my country and the right 
provoke my tongue thus lavish in report 
you be the lineal watch man of our peace 
and john of Valois in direct climb 
what then shall subject but embrace their king 
ah where in may our duty more be see 
then strive to rebate a tyrant pride 
and place the true shepherd of our commonwealth 

this counsel Artois like to fruitful shower 
have add growth unto my dignity 
and by the fiery vigour of thy word 
hot courage be engender in my breast 
which heretofore be rake in ignorance 
but now do mount with golden wing of fame 
and will approve fair Isabel descent 
able to yoke their stubborn neck with steel 
that spurn against my sovereignty in France sound a horn 
a messenger lord Awdley know from whence 

the duke of Lorraine have cross the sea 
in treat he may have conference with your highness 

admit he lord that we may hear the news 
say duke of Lorraine wherefore be thou come 

the most renown prince K john of France 
do greet thou Edward and by i command 
that for so much as by his liberal gift 
the Guyen dukedom be entail to thou 
thou do he lowly homage for the same 
and for that purpose here I summon thou 
repair to France within these forty day 
that there accord as the custom be 
thou may be swear true liegeman to our king 
or else thy title in that province die 
and he himself will repossess the place 

see how occasion laugh i in the face 
no soon mind to prepare for France 
but straight I be invite nay with threat 
upon a penalty enjoin to come 
it be but a childish part to say he nay 
Lorraine return this answer to thy lord 
I mean to visit he as he request 
but how not servile dispose to bend 
but like a conqueror to make he bow 
his lame unpolished shift be come to light 
and truth have pull the wizard from his face 
that set a glass upon his arrogance 
dare he command a fealty in i 
tell he the crown that he usurp be my 
and where he set his foot he ought to knee 
it be not a petty dukedom that I claim 
but all the whole dominion of the realm 
which if with grudge he refuse to yield 
I will take away those borrow plume of he 
and send he naked to the wilderness 

then Edward here in spite of all thy lord 
I do pronounce defiance to thy face 

Defiance french man we rebound it back 
even to the bottom of thy master throat 
and be it speak with reverence of the king 
my gracious father and these other lord 
I hold thy message but as scurrilous 
and he that send thou like the lazy drone 
creep up by stealth unto the eagles nest 
from whence we will shake he with so rough a storm 
as other shall be warn by his harm 

bid he leave of the lion case he wear 
lest meet with the lion in the field 
he chance to tear he piecemeal for his pride 

the sound counsel I can give his grace 
be to surrender ere he be constrain 
a voluntary mischief have less scorn 
then when reproach with violence be bear 

regenerate traitor viper to the place 
where thou be foster in thy infancy 
bear thou a part in this conspiracy 

Lorraine behold the sharpness of this steel 
fervent desire that sit against my heart 
be far more thorny prick than this blade 
that with the nightingale I shall be scare 
as oft as I dispose myself to rest 
until my colour be display in France 
this be thy final answer so be go 

it be not that nor any english brave 
afflict i so as do his poison view 
that be most false shall most of all be true 

now lord our fleet bark be under sail 
our gage be throw and war be soon begin 
but not so quick bring unto a end 

but wherefore come sir William Montague 
how stand the league between the scot and we

and now the tyrant have begirt with siege

who husband have in Britain serve so long 
about the plant of lord Mouneford there

ignoble David have thou none to grieve 
but silly lady with thy threaten arm 
but I will make you shrink your snaily horn 
first therefore Audley this shall be thy charge 
go levy footman for our war in France 
and Ned take muster of our man at arm

when aue Cesar they pronounce aloud 
within this school of honour I shall learn 
either to sacrifice my foe to death 
or in a rightful quarrel spend my breath 
then cheerful forward each a several way 
in great affair it be nought to use delay 

Alas how much in vain my poor eye gaze 
for succour that my sovereign shall send 
a cousin Montague I fear thou want 
the lively spirit sharp to solicit 
with vehement suit the king in my behalf

to be the scornful captive to a scot 
either to be woo with broad untune oath 
or force by rough insult barbarism

their light bear snaffle nor their nimble spu 
nor lay aside their jack of gymould mail

when he shall hear it will triumph for joy 
then dear my liege now niggard not thy state 
be at the wall enter our homely gate 

pardon i countess I will come no near 
I dream tonight of treason and I fear 

far from this place let ugly treason lie 

no far off than her conspire eye 
which shoot infect poison in my heart 
beyond repulse of wit or cure of art 
now in the sun alone it do not lie 
with light to take light from a mortal eye 
for here today star that my eye will see 
more than the sun steal my own light from i 
contemplative desire desire to be 
in contemplation that may master thou 
Warwick artoys to horse and let we away 

what may I speak to make my sovereign stay 

what need a tongue to such a speak eye 
that more persuade then win oratory 

let not thy presence like the April sun 
flatter our earth and sudden be do 
more happy do not make our outward wall 
than thou will grace our inner house withal 
our house my liege be like a country swain 
who habitude and manner blunt and plain 
presage nought yet inly beautify 
with bounty riches and fair hide pride 
for where the golden ore do bury lie 
the ground undecked with nature tapestry 
seem barren sere unfertile fruitless dry 
and where the upper turf of earth do boast 
his pride perfume and party colour cost 
delve there and find this issue and their pride 
to spring from ordure and corruption side 
but to make up my all to long compare 
these ragged wall no testomie be 
what be within but like a cloak do hide 
from weather west the under garnish pride 
more gracious than my term can let thou be 
entreat thyself to stay a while with i 

as wise as fair what fond fit can be hear 
when wisdom keep the gate as beauty guard 
countess albeit my business urge i 
it shall attend while I attend on thou 
come on my lord here will I host tonight 

I may perceive his eye in her eye lose 
his care to drink her sweet tongue utterance 
and change passion like inconstant cloud 
that rack upon the carriage of the wind 
increase and die in his disturb cheek 
lo when she blush even then do he look pale 
as if her cheek by some enchant power 
attract have the cherry blood from he 
a none with reverent fear when she grow pale 
his cheek put on their scarlet ornament 
but no more like her orient all red 
than brick to coral or live thing to dead 
why do he then thus counterfeit her look 
if she do blush it be tender modest shame 
be in the sacred present of a king 
if he do blush it be red immodest shame 
to wail his eye amiss be a king 
if she look pale it be silly woman fear 
to bear herself in presence of a king 
if he look pale it be with guilty fear 
to dote a miss be a mighty king 
then scottish war farewell I fear it will prove 
a linger english siege of peevish love 
here come his highness walk all alone 

Shee be grow more fair far since I come thither 
her voice more silver every word then other 
her wit more fluent what a strange discourse 
unfold she of David and his Scot 
even thus quoth she he speak and then speak broad 
with epithet and accent of the scot 
but somewhat better than the scot can speak 
and thus quoth she and answer then herself 
for who can speak like she but she herself 
breathe from the wall a angel note from heaven 
of sweet defiance to her barbarous foe 
when she will talk of peace methinks her tongue 
command war to prison when of war 
it waken Caesar from his roman grave 
to hear war beautify by her discourse 
wisdom be foolishness but in her tongue 
beauty a slander but in her fair face 
there be no summer but in her cheerful look 
nor frosty winter but in her disdain 
I can blame the Scot that do besiege she 
for she be all the treasure of our land 
but call they coward that they run away 
have so rich and fair a cause to stay 
be thou there Lodowick give i ink and paper 

I will my liege 

and bid the lord hold on their play at chess 
for we will walk and meditate alone 

I will my sovereign 

this fellow be well read in poetry 
and have a lusty and persuasive spirit 
I will acquaint he with my passion 
which he shall shadow with a veil of lawn 
through which the queen of beauty queen shall see 
herself the ground of my infirmity 

have thou pen ink and paper ready Lodowick 

ready my liege 

then in the summer arbour sit by i 
make it our counsel house or cabinet 
since green our thought green be the conventicle 
where we will case we by disburden they 
now Lodwick invocate some golden muse 
to bring thou hither a enchant pen 
that may for sigh set down true sigh indeed 
talk of grief to make thou ready groan 
and when thou write of tear encouch the word 
before and after with such sweet lament 
that it may raise drop in a tartar eye 
and make a flint heart Sythian pitiful 
for so much move have a poet pen 
then if thou be a poet move thou so 
and be enrich by thy sovereign love 
for if the touch of sweet concordant string 
can force attendance in the ear of hell 
how much more shall the strain of poet wit 
beguile and ravish soft and humane mind 

to who my lord shall I direct my style 

to one that shame the fair and sot the wise 
who body be a abstract or a brief 
contain each general virtue in the world 
better than beautiful thou must begin 
devise for fair a fair word then fair 
and every ornament that thou will praise 
fly it a pitch above the soar of praise 
for flattery fear thou not to be convict 
for be thy admiration ten time more 
ten time ten thousand more thy worth exceed 
of that thou be to praise their praise worth 
begin I will to contemplate the while 
forget not to set down how passionate 
how heart sick and how full of languishment 
her beauty make i 

write I to a woman 

what beauty else can triumph on i 
or who but woman do our love lay greet 
what think thou I do bid thou praise a horse 

of what condition or estate she be 
it be requisite that I shall know my lord 

of such estate that she be as a throne 
and my estate the footstool where she tread 
then may thou judge what her condition be 
by the proportion of her mightiness 
write on while I peruse she in my thought 
her voice to music or the nightingale 
to music every summer leap swain 
compare his sunburn lover when she speak 
and why shall I speak of the nightingale 
the nightingale singe of adulterate wrong 
and that compare be too satirical 
for sin though sin will not be so esteem 
but rather virtue sin sin virtue deem 
her hair far soft then the silk worm twist 
like to a flatter glass do make more fair 
the yellow amber like a flatter glass 
come in to soon for write of her eye 
I will say that like a glass they catch the sun 
and thence the hot reflection do rebound 
against my breast and burn my heart within 
ah what a world of descant make my soul 
upon this voluntary ground of love 
come Lodwick have thou turn thy ink to gold 
if not write but in letter capital my mistress name 
and it will guild thy paper read lord read 
fill thou the empty hollow of my ear 
with the sweet hear of thy poetry 

I have not to a period bring her praise 

her praise be as my love both infinite 
which apprehend such violent extreme 
that they disdain a end period 
her beauty have no match but my affection 
she more than most my most and more than more 
she more to praise then tell the sea by drop 
nay more than drop the massy earth by sand 
and say by say print they in memory 
then wherefore talk thou of a period 
to that which crave unended admiration 
Read let we hear 

more fair and chaste than be the queen of shade 

that love have two fault gross and palpable 
compare thou she to the pale queen of night 
who be set in dark seem therefore light 
what be she when the sun lift up his head 
but like a fade taper dim and dead 
my love shall brave the eye of heaven at noon 
and be unmask outshine the golden sun 

what be the other fault my sovereign lord 

Read over the line again 

more fair and chaste 

I do not bid thou talk of chastity 
to ransack so the treason of her mind 
for I have rather have she chase then chaste 
out with the moon line I will none of it 
and let i have she liken to the sun 
say she have thrice more splendour than the sun 
that her perfection emulate the sun 
that she breed sweet as plenteous as the sun 
that she do thaw cold winter like the sun 
that she do cheer fresh summer like the sun 
that she do dazzle gazer like the sun 
and in this application to the sun 
bid she be free and general as the sun 
who smile upon the base weed that grow 
as love as on the fragrant rose 
let we see what follow that same moonlight line 

more fair and chaste than be the lover of shade 
more bold in constancy 

in constancy then who 

then judith be 

o monstrous line put in the next a sword 
and I shall woo she to cut of my head 
blot blot good Lodowick let we hear the next 

there be all that yet be do 

I thank thou then thou have do little ill 
but what be do be pass passing ill 
no let the captain talk of boisterous war 
the prisoner of emure dark constraint 
the sick man best set down the pang of death 
the man that starve the sweetness of a feast 
the freeze soul the benefit of fire 
and every grief his happy opposite 
love can sound well but in lover tongue 
give i the pen and paper I will write 

but soft here come the treasurer of my spirit 
Lodwick thou know not how to draw a battle 
these wing these flanker and these squadron 
argue in thou defective discipline 
thou shall have place this here this other here 

pardon my boldness my thrice gracious lord 
let my intrusion here be call my duty 
that come to see my sovereign how he fare 

go draw the same I tell thou in what form 

I go 

sorry I be to see my liege so sad 
what may thy subject do to drive from thou 
thy gloomy consort sullen melancholy 

ah lady I be blunt and can straw 
the flower of solace in a ground of shame 
since I come hither countess I be wrong 

now God forbid that any in my house 
shall think my sovereign wrong thrice gentle king 

acquaint i with their cause of discontent 
how near then shall I be to remedy 

as near my liege as all my woman power 
can pawn itself to buy thy remedy 

if thou speak true then have I my redress 
engage thy power to redeem my joy 
and I be joyful countess else I die 

I will my liege 

swear county that thou will 

by heaven I will 

then take thyself a little way aside 
and tell thyself a king do dote on thou 
say that within thy power do lie 
to make he happy and that thou have swear 
to give he all the joy within thy power 
do this and tell i when I shall be happy 

all this be do my thrice dread sovereign 
that power of love that I have power to give 
thou have with all devout obedience 
employ i how thou will in proof thereof 

thou hear i say that I do dote on thou 

if on my beauty take it if thou can 
though little I do prize it ten time less 
if on my virtue take it if thou can 
for virtue store by give do augment 
be it on what it will that I can give 
and thou can take away inherit it 

it be thy beauty that I will enjoy 

o be it paint I will wipe it of 
and dispose myself to give it thou 
but sovereign it be solder to my life 
take one and both for like a humble shadow 
it haunt the sunshine of my summer life 
but thou may leave it i to sport with all 

as easy may my intellectual soul 
be lend away and yet my body live 
as lend my body palace to my soul 
away from she and yet retain my soul 
my body be her bower her court her abbey 
and she a angel pure divine unspotted 
if I shall leave her house my lord to thou 
I kill my poor soul and my poor soul i 

do thou not swear to give i what I will 

I do my liege so what you will I can 

I wish no more of thou than thou may give 
nor beg I do not but I rather buy 
that be thy love and for that love of thou 
in rich exchange I tender to thou my 

but that your lip be sacred my lord 
you will profane the holy name of love 
that love you offer i you can give 
for Caesar owe that tribute to his queen 
that love you beg of i I can give 
for Sara owe that duty to her lord 
he that do clip or counterfeit your stamp 
shall die my lord and will your sacred self 
commit high treason against the king of heaven 
to stamp his image in forbid metal 
for get your allegiance and your oath 
in violate marriage sacred law 
you break a great honour than yourself 
to be a king be of a young house 
than to be marry your progenitor 
sole reign Adam on the universe 
by God be honour for a marry man 
but not by he anoint for a king 
it be a penalty to break your statute 
though not enact with your highness hand 
how much more to infringe the holy act 
make by the mouth of God seal with his hand 
I know my sovereign in my husband love 
who now do loyal service in his war 
do but to try the wife of Salisbury 
whether she will hear a wanton tale or no 
lest be therein guilty by my stay 
from that not from my liege I turn away 

whether be her beauty by her word divine 
or be her word sweet chaplain to her beauty 
like as the wind do beautify a sail 
and as a sail become the unseen wind 
so do her word her beauty beauty word 
oh that I be a honey gather bee 
to bear the comb of virtue from his flower 
and not a poison suck envious spider 
to turn the vice I take to deadly venom 
religion be austere and beauty gentle 
to strike a guardian for so fair a weed 
oh that she be as be the air to i 
why so she be for when I will embrace she 
this do I and catch nothing but myself 
I must enjoy she for I can beat 
with reason and reproof fond love away 

here come her father I will work with he 
to bear my colour in this field of love 

how be it that my sovereign be so sad 
may I with pardon know your highness grief 
and that my old endeavour will remove it 
it shall not cumber long your majesty 

a kind and voluntary gift thou profer 
that I be forward to have beg of thou 
but oh thou world great nurse of flattery 
why do thou tip man tongue with golden word 
and poise their deed with weight of heavy lead 
that fair performance can follow promise 
oh that a man may hold the heart close book 
and choke the lavish tongue when it do utter 
the breath of falsehood not character there 

far be it from the honour of my age 
that I shall owe bright gold and render lead 
age be a cynic not a flatterer 
I say again that I if know your grief 
and that by i it may be lessen 
my proper harm shall buy your highness good 
these be the vulgar tender of false man 
that never pay the duty of their word 

thou will not stick to swear what thou have say 
but when thou know my grief condition 
this rash disgorge vomit of thy word 
thou will eat up again and leave i helpless 

by heaven I will not though your majesty 
do bid i run upon your sword and die 
say that my grief be no way medicinable 
but by the loss and bruise of thy honour 

if nothing but that loss may vantage you 
I will accomplish that loss my vantage to 

think that thou can answer thy oath again 

I can nor I will not if I can 

but if thou do what shall I say to thou 

what may be say to any perjure villain 
that break the sacred warrant of a oath 

what will thou say to one that break a oath 

that he have break his faith with God and man 
and from they both stand excommunicate 

what office be it to suggest a man 
to break a lawful and religious vow 

a office for the devil not for man 

that destille office must thou do for i 
or break thy oath or cancel all the bond 
of love and duty betwixt thyself and i 
and therefore Warwick if thou be thyself 
the lord and master of thy word and oath 
go to thy daughter and in my behalf 
command she woo she win her any ware 
to be my mistress and my secret love 
I will not stand to hear thou make reply 
thy oath break she or let thy sovereign die 

o dote king or detestable office 
well may I tempt myself to wrong myself 
when he have swear i by the name of God 
to break a vow make by the name of God 
what if I swear by this right hand of i 
to cut this right hand of the better way 
be to profane the idol then confound it 
but neither will I do I will keep my oath 
and to my daughter make a recantation 
of all the virtue I have preach to she 
I will say she must forget her husband Salisbury 
if she remember to embrace the king 
I will say a oath may easy be break 
but not so easy pardon be break 
I will say it be true charity to love 
but not true love to be so charitable 
I will say his greatness may bear out the shame 
but not his kingdom can buy out the sin 
I will say it be my duty to persuade 
but not her honesty to give consent 

see where she come be never father have 
against his child a embassage so bad 

my lord and father I have seek for you 
my mother and the peer importune you 
to keep in promise of his majesty 
and do your best to make his highness merry 

how shall I enter in this graceless arrant 
I must not call her child for where the father 
that will in such a suit seduce his child 
then wife of Salisbury shall I so begin 
no he be my friend and where be find the friend 
that will do friendship such endamagement 
neither my daughter nor my dear friend wife 
I be not Warwick as thou think I be 
but a attorney from the court of hell 
that thus have house my spirit in his form 
to do a message to thou from the king 
the mighty king of England dote on thou 
he that have power to take away thy life 
have power to take thy honour than consent 
to pawn thy honour rather than thy life 
honour be often lose and get again 
but life once go have no recovery 
the sun that wither hay do nourish grass 
the king that will distain thou will advance thou 
the poet write that great Achilles spear 
can heal the wound it make the moral be 
what mighty man misdo they can amend 
the lion do become his bloody jaw 
and grace his foragement by be mild 
when vassal fear lie tremble at his foot 
the king will in his glory hide thy shame 
and those that gaze on he to find out thou 
will lose their eyesight look in the sun 
what can one drop of poison harm the sea 
who huge vasture can digest the ill 
and make it lose his operation 
the king great name will temper their misdeed 
and give the bitter portion of reproach 
a sugar sweet and most delicious taste 
beside it be no harm to do the thing 
which without shame can not be leave undo 
thus have I in his majesty behalf 
apparel sin in virtuous sentence 
and dwell upon thy answer in his suit 

unnatural besiege woe i unhappy 
to have escape the danger of my foe 
and to be ten time worse injure by friend 
have he no mean to stain my honest blood 
but to corrupt the author of my blood 
to be his scandalous and vile solicitor 
no marvel though the branch be then infect 
when poison have encompass the root 
no marvel though the leprous infant die 
when the stern dame envenom the dug 
why then give sin a passport to offend 
and youth the dangerous reign of liberty 
blot out the strict forbid of the law 
and cancel every cannon that prescribe 
a shame for shame or penance for offence 
no let i die if his too boisterous will 
will have it so before I will consent 
to be a actor in his graceless lust 

why now thou speak as I will have thou speak 
and mark how I unsay my word again 
a honourable grave be more esteem 
than the pollute closet of a king 
the great man the great be the thing 
be it good or bad that he shall undertake 
a unreputed mote fly in the sun 
present a great substance than it be 
the fresh summer day do soon taint 
the loathe carrion that it seem to kiss 
deep be the blow make with a mighty axe 
that sin do ten time aggravate itself 
that be commit in a holy place 
a evil deed do by authority 
be sin and subornation deck a ape 
in tissue and the beauty of the robe 
add but the great scorn unto the beast 
a spacious field of reason can I urge 
between his gloomy daughter and thy shame 
that poison show worst in a golden cup 
dark night seem dark by the lightning flash 
lily that fester smell far worse than weed 
and every glory that incline to sin 
the shame be treble by the opposite 
so leave I with my blessing in thy bosom 
which then convert to a most heavy curse 
when thou convert from honour golden name 
to the black faction of bed blot shame 

ill follow thou and when my mind turn so 
my body sink my soul in endless woe 

thrice noble Audley well encounter here

for I will use it as my write paper 
and so reduce he from a scold drum 
to be the herald and dear counsel bearer 
betwixt a goddess and a mighty king 
go bid the drummer learn to touch the lute 
or hang he in the brace of his drum 
for now we think it a uncivil thing 
to trouble heaven with such harsh resound away Exit 
the quarrel that I have require no arm 
but these of my and these shall meet my foe 
in a deep march of penetrable groan 
my eye shall be my arrow and my sigh

to whirl away my sweet artillery 
ah but alas she win the sun of i 
for that be she herself and thence it come 
that poet term the wanton warrior blind 
but love have eye as judgement to his step 
till two much love glory daisy they

and let her chase away these winter cloud 
for she give beauty both to heaven and earth 
the sin be more to hack and hew poor man 
then to embrace in a unlawful bed

since leathern Adam till this young hour 

go Lodwick put thy hand into thy purse 
play spend give riot waste do what thou will

but sith I see your majesty so bend 
that my unwillingness my husband love

So be your desire if the law 
can hinder you to execute the one 
let it forbid you to attempt the other 
I can think you love i as you say 
unless you do make good what you have swear 
no more thy husband and the queen shall die 
fair thou be by far than Hero be 
beardless Leander not so strong as I 
he swim a easy current for his love 
but I will throng a hellie spout of blood 
to arrive at cestus where my hero lie 

nay you will do more you will make the river to 
with their heart blood that keep our love asunder 
of which my husband and your wife be twain 

thy beauty make they guilty of their death 
and give in evidence that they shall die 
upon which verdict I their judge condemn they 

o perjure beauty more corrupt judge 
when to the great starchamber over our head 
the universal session call to count 
this pack evil we both shall tremble for it 

what say my fair love be she resolute 

resolute to be dissolve and therefore this 
keep but thy word great king and I be thou 
stand where thou do I will part a little from thou 
and see how I will yield i to thy hand 
here by my side do hang my wedding knife 
take thou the one and with it kill thy queen 
and learn by i to find she where she lie 
and with this other I will dispatch my love 
which now lie fast asleep within my heart 
when they be go then I will consent to love 
stir not lascivious king to hinder i 
my resolution be more nimble far 
than thy prevention can be in my rescue 
and if thou stir I strike therefore stand still 
and hear the choice that I will put thou to 
either swear to leave thy most unholy suit 
and never hence forth to solicit i 
or else by heaven this sharp point knife 
shall stain thy earth with that which thou will stain 
my poor chaste blood swear Edward swear 
or I will strike and die before thou here 

Even by that power I swear that give i now 
the power to be ashamed of myself 
I never mean to part my lip again 
in any word that tend to such a suit 
arise true english lady who our I will 
may better boast of then ever roman might 
of she who ransack treasury have task 
the vain endeavour of so many pen 
arise and be my fault thy honour fame 
which after age shall enrich thou with 
I be awake from this idle dream 
Warwick my son Derby artoys and Audley 
brave warrior all where be you all this while 

Warwick I make thou warden of the north 
thou prince of Wales and Audley straight to sea 
scour to newhaven some there stay for i 
myself artoys and Derby will through Flaunders 
to greet our friend there and to crave their aid 
this night will scarce suffice i to discover 
my folly siege against a faithful lover 
for ere the sun shall guide the Eastern sky 
we will wake he with our martial harmony 

here till our navy of a thousand and sail 
have make a breakfast to our foe by sea 
let we encamp to wait their happy speed 
Lorraine what readiness be Edward in 
how have thou hear that he provide be 
of martial furniture for this exploit 

to lay aside unnecessary soothe 
and not to spend the time in circumstance 
it be bruit for a certainty my lord 
that he be exceed strong fortify 
his subject flock as willing to war 
as if unto a triumph they be lead 

England be wont to harbour malcontent 
blood thirsty and seditious catelynes 
spend thrift and such as gape for nothing else 
but change and alteration of the state 
and be it possible 
that they be now so loyal in themselves 

all but the scot who solemn protest 
as heretofore I have inform his grace 
never to sheathe his sword or take a truce 

ah that be the anchorage of some better hope 
but on the other side to think what friend 
king Edward have retain in Netherlands 
among those everbibbing epicure 
those frothy dutch man puff with double beer 
that drink and swill in every place they come 
do not a little aggravate my ire 
beside we hear the emperor conjoin 
and stall he in his own authority 
but all the mighty that their number be 
the great glory reap the victory 
some friend have we beside drum strike power 
the stern polonian and the warlike Dane 
the king of Bohemia and of Sicily 
be all become confederate with we 
and as I think be march hither apace 
but soft I hear the music of their drum 
by which I guess that their approach be near 

king john of France as league and neighbourhood 
require when friend be any way distress 
I come to aid thou with my country force 

and from great Musco fearful to the Turk 
and lofty Poland nurse of hardy man 
I bring these servitor to fight for thou 
who willing will venture in thy cause 

Welcome bohemian king and welcome all 
this your great kindness I will not forget 
beside your plentiful reward in crown 
that from our treasury you shall receive 
there come a hare brain nation deck in pride 
the spoil of who will be a treble game 
and now my hope be full my joy complete 
at sea we be as puissant as the force 
of Agamemnon in the haven of Troy 
by land with Zerxes we compare of strength 
who soldier drink up river in their thirst 
then Bayard like blind overween Ned 
to reach at our imperial diadem 
be either to be swallow of the wave 
or hack apieces when thou come ashore 

near to the cost I have describe my lord 
as I be busy in my watchful charge 
the proud Armado of king Edward ship 
which at the first far off when I do ken 
seem as it be a grove of wither pine 
but draw near their glorious bright aspect 
their stream ensign wrought of colour silk 
like to a meadow full of sundry flower 
adorn the naked bosom of the earth 
majestical the order of their course 
figure the horn circle of the moon 
and on the top gallant of the admiral 
and likewise all the handmaid of his train 
the arm of England and of France unite 
be quarter equal by herald art 
thus tight carry with a merry gale 
they plough the ocean hitherward amain 
dare he already crop the flower de Luce 
I hope the honey be gather thence 
he with the spider afterward approach 
shall suck forth deadly venom from the leaf 
but where be our navy how be they prepare 
to wing themselves against this flight of raven 

they have knowledge bring they by the scout 
do break from anchor straight and puff with rage 
no otherwise than be their sail with wind 
make forth as when the empty eagle fly 
to satify his hungry gripe maw 

These for thy news return unto thy bark 
and if thou escape the bloody stroke of war 
and do survive the conflict come again 
and let we hear the manner of the fight exit 
mean space my lord it be best we be disperse 
to several place lest they chance to land 
first you my lord with your bohemian troop 
shall pitch your battle on the low hand 
my elder son the duke of Normandy 
together with this aid of Muscovite 
shall climb the high ground another way 
here in the middle cost betwixt you both 
Philip my young boy and I will lodge 
so lord begone and look unto your charge exunt 
you stand for France a empire fair and large 
now tell i Philip what be their concept 
touch the challenge that the english make 

I say my lord claim Edward what he can 
and bring he never so plain a pedigree 
it be you be in possession of the crown 
and that be the sure point of all the law 
but be it not yet ere he shall prevail 
I will make a conduit of my dear blood 
or chase those straggle upstart home again 

Well say young Philip call for bread and wine 
that we may cheer our stomach with repast the battle hard afar off 
to look our foe more stern in the face 
now be begin the heavy day at sea 
fight Frenchmen fight be like the field of bear 
when they defend their youngling in their cave 
stir angry Nemesis the happy helm 
that with the sulphur battle of your rage 
the english fleet may be disperse and sink 

o father how this echo cannon shoot shot 
like sweet harmony digest my cate 
now boy thou hear what thunder terror it be 
to buckle for a kingdom sovereignty 
the earth with giddy tremble when it shake 
or when the exhalation of the air 
break in extremity of lightning flash 
affright not more than king when they dispose 
to show the rancour of their high swell heart 
retreat be sound one side have the worse retreat 
o if it be the french sweet fortune turn 
and in thy turn change the forward wind 
that with advantage of a favour sky 
our man may vanquish and thither fly 

my heart misgive say mirror of pale death 
to who belong the honour of this day 
relate I pray thou if thy breath will serve 
the sad discourse of this discomfiture 

I will my lord 
my gracious sovereign France have tane the foil 
and boast Edward triumph with success 
these iron heart navy 
when last I be reporter to your grace 
both full of angry spleen of hope and fear 
haste to meet each other in the face 
at last conjoin and by their admiral 
our admiral encounter many shot 
by this the other that behold these twain 
give earnest penny of a further wrack 
like fiery dragon take their haughty flight 
and like wise meeting from their smoky womb 
send many grim ambassador of death 
then begin the day to turn to gloomy night 
and darkness do aswell enclose the quick 
as those that be but new reave of life 
no leisure serve for friend to bid farewell 
and if it have the hideous noise be such 
as each to other seem deaf and dumb 
purple the sea who channel fill as fast 
with stream gore that from the maim fell 
as do her gush moisture break into 
the cranny clefture of the through shoot plank 
here fly a head dissever from the trunk 
there mangle arm and leg be toss aloft 
as when a whirl wind take the summer dust 
and scatter it in middle of the air 
then may you see the reel vessel split 
and totter sink into the ruthless flood 
until their lofty top be see no more 
all shift be try both for defence and hurt 
and now the effect of valour and of force 
of resolution and of a cowardice 
we lively picture how the one for fame 
the other by compulsion lay about 
much do the nom per illa that brave ship 
so do the black snake of Bullen than which 
a bonny vessel never yet spread sail 
but all in vain both sun the wine and tide 
revolt all unto our foe man side 
that we perforce be fain to give they way 
and they be land thus my tale be do 
we have untimely lose and they have win 

then rest there nothing but with present speed 
to join our several force all in one 
and bid they battle ere they range to far 
come gentle Philip let we hence depart 
this soldier word have pierce thy father heart 

well meet my master how now what be the news 
and wherefore be you lade thus with stuff 
what be it quarter day that you remove 
and carry bag and baggage too 

quarter day I and quarter pay I fear 
have we not hear the news that fly abroad 

what news 

how the french navy be destroy at sea 
and that the english army be arrive 

what then 

what then quoth you why be it not time to fly 
when envy and destruction be so nigh 

content thou man they be far enough from hence 
and will be meet I warrant you to their cost 
before they break so far into the realm 

I so the grasshopper do spend the time 
in mirthful jollity till winter come 
and then too late he will redeem his time 
when freeze cold have nip his careless head 
he that no soon will provide a cloak 
then when he see it do begin to reign 
may peradventure for his negligence 
be thorough wash when he suspect it not 
we that have charge and such a train as this 
must look in time to look for they and we 
lest when we will we can be relieve 

be like you then despair of ill success 
and think your country will be subjugate 

we can tell it be good to fear the worst 

yet rather fight then like unnatural son 
forsake your love parent in distress 

tush they that have already take arm 
be many fearful million in respect 
of that small handful of our enemy 
but it be a rightful quarrel must prevail 
Edward be son unto our late king sister 
where john Valois be three degree remove 

beside there go a prophecy abroad 
publish by one that be a friar once 
who oracle have many time prove true 
and now he say the time will short come 
whenas a lion rouse in the west 
shall carry hence the fleurdeluce of France 
these I can tell you and such like surmise 
strike many french man cold unto the heart 

fly country man and citizen of France 
sweet flower peace the root of happy life 
be quite abandon and expulse the land 
instead of who ransack constrain war 
sit like to raven upon your house top 
slaughter and mischief walk within your street 
and unrestrained make havoc as they pass 
the form whereof even now myself behold 
upon this fair mountain whence I come 
for so far off as I direct my eye 
I may perceive five city all on fire 
come field and vineyard burn like a oven 
and as the leak vapour in the wind 
I turn but aside I like wise may discern 
the poor inhabitant escape the flame 
fall numberless upon the soldier pike 
three way these dreadful minister of wrath 
do tread the measure of their tragic march 
upon the right hand come the conquer king 
upon the left be hot unbridle son 
and in the midst our nation glitter host 
all which though distant yet conspire in one 
to leave a desolation where they come 
fly therefore citizen if you be wise 
seek out some habitation further of 
here if you stay your wife will be abuse 
your treasure share before your weep eye 
shelter you yourselves for now the storm do rise 
away away methinks I hear their drum 
ah wretched France I great fear thy fall 
thy glory shake like a totter wall 

where be the french man by who cunning guide 
we find the shallow of this river soon 
and have direction how to pass the sea 

here my good lord 

how be thou call tell i thy name 

Gobin de Graie if please your excellence 

then Gobin for the service thou have do 
we here enlarge and give thou liberty 
and for recompence beside this good 
thou shall receive five hundred mark in gold 
I know not how we shall have meet our son 
who now in heart I wish I may behold 

good news my lord the prince be hard at hand 
and with he come lord Awdley and the rest 
who since our land we can never meet 

welcome fair prince how have thou speed my son 
since thy arrival on the coast of France 

successful I thank the gracious heaven 
some of their strong city we have win 
as Harslen lie crotag and carentigne 
and other waste leave at our heel 
a wide apparent field and beat path 
for solitariness to progress in 
yet those that will submit we kind pardon 
for who in scorn refuse our proffer peace 
endure the penalty of sharp revenge 

ah France why shall thou be this obstinate 
against the kind embracement of thy friend 
how gentle have we think to touch thy breast 
and set our foot upon thy tender mould 
but that in froward and disdainful pride 
thou like a skittish and untamed colt 
do start aside and strike we with thy heel 
but tell i Ned in all thy warlike course 
have thou not see the usurp king of France 

yes my good lord and not two ower ago 
with full a hundred thousand fight man 
upon the one side with the river bank 
and on the other both his multitude 
I fear he will have crop our small power 
but happy perceive your approach 
he have with draw himself to Cressey plain 
where as it seem by his good array 
he mean to bid we battle present 

he shall be welcome that be the thing we crave 

Edward know that john the true king of France 
muse thou shall encroach upon his land 
and in thy tyrannous proceed slay 
his faithful subject and subvert his town 
spit in thy face and in this manner follow 
upbraid thou with thy arrogant intrusion 
first I condemn thou for a fugitive 
a thievish pirate and a needy mate 
one that have either not abide place 
or else inhabit some barren soil 
where neither herb or fruitful grain be have 
do altogether live by pilfer 
next insomuch thou have infringe thy faith 
break league and solemn covenant make with i 
I hold thou for a false pernicious wretch 
and last of all although I scorn to cope 
with one such inferior to myself 
yet in respect thy thirst be all for gold 
they labour rather to be fear then love 
to satisfy thy lust in either part 
here be I come and with i have I bring 
exceed store of treasure pearl and coin 
leave therefore now to persecute the weak 
and arm enter conflict with the arm 
let it be see amongst other petty theft 
how thou can win this pillage manful 

if gall or wormwood have a pleasant taste 
then be thy salutation honey sweet 
but as the one have not such property 
so be the other most satirical 
yet wot how I regard thy worthless tants 
if thou have utter they to foil my fame 
or dim the reputation of my birth 
know that thy wolvish bark can hurt 
if sly to insinuate with the world 
and with a strumpet artificial line 
to paint thy vicious and deform cause 
be well assure the counterfeit will fade 
and in the end thy foul defect be see 
but if thou do it to provoke i on 
as who shall say I be but timorous 
or cold negligent do need a spur 
bethink thyself how slack I be at sea 
now since my land I have win no town 
enter no further but upon the coast 
and there have ever since secure sleep 
but if I have be other wise employ 
imagine Valois whether I intend 
to skirmish not for pillage but for the crown 
which thou do wear and that I vow to have 
or one of we shall fall in to this grave 

look not for cross invective at our hand 
or rail execration of despite 
let creep serpent hide in hollow bank 
sting with their tongue we have remorseless sword 
and they shall plead for we and our affair 
yet thus much brief by my father leave 
as all the immodest poison of thy throat 
be scandalous and most notorious lie 
and our pretend quarrel be true just 
so end the battle when we meet to day 
may either of we prosper and prevail 
or luckless curse receive eternal shame 

that need no further question and I know 
his conscience witness it be my right 
therefore Valois say will thou yet resign 
before the sickle thrust into the corn 
or that enkindle fury turn to flame 

Edward I know what right thou have in France 
and ere I base will resign my crown 
this champion field shall be a pool of blood 
and all our prospect as a slaughter house 

I that approve thou tyrant what thou be 
no father king or shepherd of thy realm 
but one that tear her entrails with thy hand 
and like a thirsty tiger suck her blood 

you peer of France why do you follow he 
that be so prodigal to spend your life 

who shall they follow age impotent 
but he that be their true bear sovereign 

obraidst thou he because within his face 
time have engrave deep character of age 
know that these grave scholar of experience 
like stiff grow oak will stand unmovable 
when whirl wind quick turn up young tree 

be ever any of thy father house king 
but thyself before this present time 
Edward great lineage by the mother side 
five hundred year have hold the sceptre up 
judge then conspirator by this descent 
which be the true bear sovereign this or that 

father range your battle prate no more 
these english fame will spend the time in wonder 
that night approach they may escape unfought 

lord and my love subject know the time 
that your intend force must bide the touch 
therefore my friend consider this in brief 
he that you fight for be your natural king 
he against who you fight a foreigner 
he that you fight for rule in clemency 
and fame you with a mild and gentle bit 
he against who you fight if he prevail 
will straight in throne himself in tyranny 
make slave of you and with a heavy hand 
Curtall and curb your sweet liberty 
then to protect your country and your king 
let but the haughty courage of your heart 
answer the number of your able hand 
and we shall quick chase these fugitive 
for what be this Edward but a belly god 
a tender and lascivious wantonness 
that other day be almost dead for love 
and what I pray you be his goodly guard 
such as but scant they of their chine of beef 
and take away their downy featherbed 
and present they be as resty stiff 
as it be a many over ride jade 
then french man scorn that such shall be your lord 
and rather bind you they in captive band 

Vive le roy God save king john of France

and Edward when thou dare begin the fight 

we present will meet thou john of France 
and english lord let we resolve the day

now follow lord and do he honour to 

Edward Plantagenet prince of Wales 
as I do set this helmet on thy head 
where with the chamber of this brain be fence 
so may thy temple with Bellona hand 
be still adorn with laurel victory 
fight and be valiant conquer where thou come 

Edward Plantagenet prince of Wales 
receive this lance into thy manly hand 
use it in fashion of a brazen pen 
to draw forth bloody stratagem in France 
and print thy valiant deed in honour book 
fight and be valiant vanquish where thou come 

Edward Plantagenet prince of Wales 
hold take this target wear it on thy arm 
and may the view thereof like Perscus shield 
astonish and transform thy gaze foe

now want there nought but knighthood which defer 
we leave till thou have win it in the field 
my gracious father and you forward peer

and cheer my green yet scarce appear strength 
with comfortable good presage sign 
no otherwise than do old Jacob word 
whenas he breathe his blessing on his son 
these hallow gift of you when I profane 
or use they not to glory of my god 
to patronage the fatherless and poor 
or for the benefit of England peace 
be numb my joint wax feeble both my arm 
wither my heart that like a sapless tree 
I may remain the map of infamy 

then this our steel battle shall be range 
the lead of the vanward Ned be thy 
to dignify who lusty spirit the more 
we temper it with Audley gravity 
that courage and experience join in one 
your manage may be second unto none 
for the main battle I will guide myself 
and Derby in the rearward march behind 
that orderly dispose and set in ray 
let we to horse and God grant we the day 

o Lorraine say what mean our man to fly 
our number be far great than our foe 

the garrison of Genoa my lord 
that come from Paris weary with their march 
grudge to be sudden employ 
no soon in the forefront take their place 
but straight retire so dismay the rest 
as likewise they betake themselves to flight 
in which for haste to make a safe escape 
more in the cluster throng be press to death 
then by the enemy a thousand fold 

o hapless fortune let we yet assay 
if we can counsel some of they to stay 

lord Audley while our son be in the chase 
with draw our power unto this little hill 
and here a season let we breathe ourselves 

I will my lord 

just doom heaven who secret providence 
to our gross judgement be inscrutable 
how be we bind to praise thy wondrous work 
that have this day give way unto the right 
and make the wicked stumble at themselves 

rescue king Edward rescue for thy son 

rescue artoys what be he prisoner 
or by violence fall beside his horse 

neither my lord but narrow beset 
with turn Frenchmen who he do pursue 
as it be impossible that he shall escape 
except your highness present descend 

tut let he fight we give he arm today 
and he be labour for a knighthood man 

the prince my lord the prince o succour he 
he be close encompass with a world of odds 

then will he win a world of honour to 
if he by valour can redeem he thence 
if not what remedy we have more son 
than one to comfort our decline age 

renown Edward give i leave I pray 
to lead my soldier where I may relieve 
your grace son in danger to be slay 
the snare of french like emmet on a bank 
muster about he while he lion like 
entangle in the net of their assault 
frantic rend and bit the weave toil 
but all in vain he can free himself 

Audley content I will not have a man 
on pain of death send forth to succour he 
this be the day ordain by destiny 
to season his courage with those grievous thought 
that if he break out Nestor year on earth 
will make he savour still of this exploit 

ah but he shall not live to see those day 

why then his epitaph be last praise 

yet good my lord it be too much wilfulness 
to let his blood be spill that may be save 

exclaim no more for none of you can tell 
whether a borrow aid will serve or no 
perhaps he be already slay or take 
and dare a falcon when she be in her flight 
and ever after she will be haggard like 
let Edward be deliver by our hand 
and still in danger he will expect the like 
but if himself himself redeem from thence 
he will have vanquish cheerful death and fear 
and ever after dread their force no more 
than if they be but babe or captive slave 

o cruel father farewell Edward then 

farewell sweet prince the hope of chivalry 

o will my life may ransom he from death 

but soft methinks I hear 
the dismal charge of trumpet loud retreat 
all be not slay I hope that go with he

Welcome Plantagenet 

kneel and kiss his father hand first have do my duty as beseem

my painful voyage on the boisterous sea 
of war devour gulf and steely rock 
I bring my fraught unto the wish port 
my summer hope my travel sweet reward 
and here with humble duty I present 
this sacrifice this first fruit of my sword 
crop and cut down even at the gate of death 
the king of boheme father who I slay 
who you say have entrench i round about 
and lie as thick upon my batter crest 
as on a anvil with their ponderous glave 
yet marble courage still do underprop 
and when my weary arm with often blow 
like the continual labour woodmans axe 
that be enjoin to fell a load of Oakes 
begin to falter straight I will recover 
my gift you give i and my zealous vow 
and then new courage make i fresh again 
that in despite I crave my passage forth 
And put the multitude to speedy flight his sword bear by a soldier 
Lo this have Edward hand fill your request 
and do I hope the duty of a knight 

I well thou have deserve a knighthood Ned 
and therefore with thy sword yet reak warm 
with blood of those that fight to be thy bane 
arise prince Edward trusty knight at arm 
this day thou have confound i with joy 
and proud thyself fit heir unto a king 

here be a note my gracious lord of those 
that in this conflict of our foe be slay 
eleven prince of esteem four score baron 
a hundred and twenty knight and thirty thousand 
common soldier and of our man a thousand 
Oure God be praise now john of France I hope 
thou know king Edward for no wantonness 
no love sick cockney nor his soldier jade 
but which way be the fearful king escape 

towards Poitiers noble father and his son 

Ned thou and Audley shall pursue they still 
myself and Derby will to Calais straight 
and there begirt that haven town with siege 
now lie it on a upshot therefore strike 
and wistly follow while the game on foot 

what picture this 

a pelican my lord 
wound her bosom with her crooked beak 
that so her nest of young one may be feed 
with drop of blood that issue from her heart 
the motto sic and vos and so shall you 

my lord of Salisbury since by our aid 
my enemy sir Charles of Bloys be slay 
and I again be quiet possess 
in Britain dukedom know that I resolve 
for this kind furtherance of your king and you 
to swear allegiance to his majesty 
in sign where of receive this coronet 
bear it unto he and with all my oath 
never to be but Edward faithful friend 

I take it Mountfort thus I hope ere long 
the whole dominion of the realm of France 
will be surrender to his conquer hand Exit 
now if I know but safe how to pass 
I will to Calais glad meet his grace 
whether I be by letter certify 
yet he intend to have his host remove 
it shall be so this policy will serve 
ho who be within bring Villiers to i 

Villiers thou know thou be my prisoner 
and that I may for ransom if I will 
require of thou a hundred thousand franc 
or else retain and keep thou captive still 
but so it be that for a small charge 
thou may be quit and if thou will thyself 
and this it be procure i but a passport 
of Charles the duke of Normandy that I 
without restraint may have recourse to Calais 
through all the country where he have to do 
which thou may easy obtain I think 
by reason I have often hear thou say 
he and thou be student once together 
and than thou shall be set at liberty 
how say thou will thou undertake to do it 

I will my lord but I must speak with he 

why so thou shall take horse and post from hence 
only before thou go swear by thy faith 
that if thou can not compass my desire 
thou will return my prisoner back again 
and that shall be sufficient warrant for i 

to that condition I agree my lord 
and will unfeigned perform the same 

farewell Villiers 
thus once I mean to try a french man faith 

since they refuse our proffer league my lord 
and will not open their gate and let we in 
we will entrench ourselves on every side 
that neither victuals nor supply of man 
may come to succour this accurse town 
famine shall combat where our sword be stop 

the promise aid that make they stand aloof 
be now retire and go another way 
it will repent they of their stubborn will 
but what be these poor ragged slave my lord 

ask what they be it seem they come from Calais 

you wretched pattern of despair and woe 
what be you live man ere glide ghost 
creep from your grave to walk upon the earth 

no ghost my lord but man that breathe a life 
far worse than be the quiet sleep of death 
we be distress poor inhabitant 
that long have be disease sick and lame 
and now because we be not fit to serve 
the captain of the town have thrust we forth 
that so expense of victual may be save 

a charitable deed no doubt and worthy praise 
but how do you imagine then to speed 
we be your enemy in such a case 
we can no less but put you to the sword 
since when we proffer truce it be refuse 

and if your grace no otherwise vouchsafe 
as welcome death be unto we as life 

poor silly man much wrong and more distress 
go Derby go and see they be relieve 
command that victual be appoint they 
and give to every one five crown a piece 
the lion scorn to touch the yield prey 
and Edward sword must fresh itself in such 
as wilful stubbornness have make perverse 

lord persie welcome what be the news in England 

the queen my lord come here to your grace 
and from her highness and the lord vicegerent 
I bring this happy tiding of success 
David of Scotland late up in arm 
think belike he soon shall prevail 
your highness be absent from the realm 
be by the fruitful service of your peer 
and painful travel of the queen herself 
that big with child be every day in arm 
vanquish subdue and take prisoner 

thank persie for thy news with all my heart 
what be he take he prisoner in the field 

a esquire my lord john Copland be his name 
who since entreat by her majesty 
deny to make surrender of his prize 
to any but unto your grace alone 
whereat the queen be grievous displease 

well then we will have a pursuant dispatch 
to summon Copland hither out of hand 
and with he he shall bring his prisoner king 

the queen my lord herself by this at sea 
and purpose as soon as wind will serve 
to land at Calais and to visit you 

she shall be welcome and to wait her come 
I will pitch my tent near to the sandy shore 

the burgess of Calais mighty king 
have by a counsel willing decree 
to yield the town and castle to your hand 
upon condition it will please your grace 
to grant they benefit of life and good 

they will so then belike they may command 
dispose elect and govern as they list 
no sirrah tell they since they do refuse 
our princely clemency at first proclaim 
they shall not have it now although they will 
will accept of nought but fire and sword 
except within these two day six of they 
that be the wealthy merchant in the town 
come naked all but for their linen shirt 
with each a halter hang about his neck 
and prostrate yield themselves upon their knee 
to be afflict hang or what I please 
and so you may inform their mastership 

why this it be to trust a break staff 
have we not be persuade john our king 
will with his army have relieve the town 
we have not stand upon defiance so 
but now it be past that no man can recall 
and better some do go to wrack then all 

I wonder Villiers thou shall importune i 
for one that be our deadly enemy 

not for his sake my gracious lord so much 
be I become a earnest advocate 
as that thereby my ransom will be quit 

thy ransom man why need thou talk of that 
be thou not free and be not all occasion 
that happen for advantage of our foe 
to be accept of and stand upon 

no good my lord except the same be just 
for profit must with honour be commix 
or else our action be but scandalous 
but let pass these intricate objection 
will please your highness to subscribe or no 

Villiers I will not nor I can do it 
Salisbury shall not have his will so much 
to claim a passport how it please himself 

why then I know the extremity my lord 
I must return to prison whence I come 
change return I hope thou will not 
what bird that have escape the fowler gin 
will not beware how she be ensnare again 
or what be he so senseless and secure 
that have hardly past a dangerous gulf 
will put himself in peril there again 

ah but it be my oath my gracious lord 
which I in conscience may not violate 
or else a kingdom shall not draw i hence 

thy oath why that do bind thou to abide 
have thou not swear obedience to thy prince 

in all thing that upright he command 
but either to persuade or threaten i 
not to perform the covenant of my word 
be lawless and I need not to obey 

why be it lawful for a man to kill 
and not to break a promise with his foe 

to kill my lord when war be once proclaim 
so that our quarrel be for wrong receive 
no doubt be lawful permit we 
but in a oath we must be well advise 
how we do swear and when we once have swear 
not to infringe it though we die therefore 
therefore my lord as will I return 
as if I be to fly to paradise 

stay my Villeirs thy honourable mind 
deserve to be eternal admire 
thy suit shall be no long thus defer 
give i the paper I will subscribe to it 
and wheretofore I love thou as Villeirs 
hereafter I will embrace thou as my self 
stay and be still in favour with thy lord 

I humble thank your grace I must dispatch 
and send this passport first unto the earl 
and then I will attend your highness pleasure 

do so Villeirs and Charles when he have need 
be such his soldier howsoever he speed 

Come Charles and arm thou Edward be entrap 
the prince of Wales be fall into our hand 
and we have compass he he can escape 

but will your highness fight today 

what else my son he be scarce eight thousand strong 
and we be threescore thousand at the least 

I have a prophecy my gracious lord 
wherein be write what success be like 
to happen we in this outrageous war 
it be deliver i at cress field 
by one that be a age hermit there 
when feather soul shall make thy army tremble 
and flint stone rise and break the battle ray 
then think on he that do not now dissemble 
for that shall be the hapless dreadful day 
yet in the end thy foot thou shall advance 
as far in England as thy foe in France 

by this it seem we shall be fortunate 
for as it be impossible that stone 
shall ever rise and break the battle ray 
or airy foul make man in arm to quake 
so be it like we shall not be subdue 
or say this may be true yet in the end 
since he do promise we shall drive he hence 
and forage their country as they have do we 
by this revenge that loss will seem the less 
but all be frivolous fancy toy and dream 
once we be sure we have ensnare the son 
catch we the father after how we can 

Audley the arm of death embrace we round 
and comfort have we none save that to die 
we pay sour earnest for a sweet life 
at Cressey field our cloud of warlike smoke 
choke up those french mouth and dissever they 
but now their multitude of million hide 
mask as it be the beauteous burn sun 
leave no hope to we but sullen dark 
and eye less terror of all end night 

this sudden mighty and expedient head 
that they have make fair prince be wonderful 
before we in the valley lie the king 
vantagd with all that heaven and earth can yield 
his party strong battle than our whole 
his son the brave duke of Normandy 
have trim the mountain on our right hand up 
in shine plate that now the aspire hill 
show like a silver quarry or a orb 
aloft the which the banner baneret 
and new replenish pendant cuff the air 
and beat the wind that for their gaudiness 
struggle to kiss they on our left handly 
Philip the young issue of the king 
cote the other hill in such array 
that all his guild upright pike do seem 
straight tree of gold the pendant leaf 
and their device of antique heraldry 
quarter in colour seem sundry fruit 
make it the orchard of the hesperide 
behind we two the hill do bear his height 
for like a half moon open but one way 
it round we in there at our back be lodge 
the fatal crossbow and the battle there 
be govern by the rough chattillion 
then thus it stand the valley for our flight 
the king bind in the hill on either hand 
be proud royalize by his son 
and on the hill behind stand certain death 
in pay and service with chattillion 

death name be much more mighty than his deed 
thy parcel this power have make it more 
as many sand as these my hand can hold 
be but my handful of so many sand 
than all the world and call it but a power 
easy take up and quick throw away 
but if I stand to count they sand by sand 
the number will confound my memory 
and make a thousand million of a task 
which brief be not more indeed than one 
these quarter squadron and these regiment 
before behind we and on either hand 
be but a power when we name a man 
his hand his foot his head have several strength 
and be all but ownself instant strength 
why all this many Audely be but one 
and we can call it all but one man strength 
he that have far to go tell it by mile 
if he shall tell the step it kill his heart 
the drop be infinite that make a flood 
and yet thou know we call it but a rain 
there be but one France one king of France 
that France have no more king and that same king 
have but the puissant legion of one king 
and we have one then apprehend no odds 
for one to one be fair equality 

what tiding messenger be plain and brief 

the king of France my sovereign lord and master 
greet by i his foe the prince of wall 
if thou call forth a hundred man of name 
of lord knight esquire and english gentleman 
and with thyself and those kneel at his foot 
he straight will fold his bloody colour up 
and ransom shall redeem life forfeit 
if not this day shall drink more english blood 
then ere be bury in our British earth 
what be the answer to his proffer mercy 

this heaven that cover France contain the mercy 
that draw from i submissive orison 
that such base breath shall vanish from my lip 
to urge the plea of mercy to a man 
the lord forbid return and tell the king 
my tongue be make of steel and it shall beg 
my mercy on his coward burgonet 
tell he my colour be as red as he 
my man as bold our english arm as strong 
return he my defiance in his face 

I go 

what news with thou 

i he duke of Normandy my lord and master 
pity thy youth be so engird with peril 
by i have send a nimble joint jennet 
as swift as ever yet thou do bestride 
and therewithal he counsel thou to fly 
else death himself have swear that thou shall die 

back with the beast unto the beast that send he 
tell he I can sit a coward horse 
bid he to day bestride the jade himself 
for I will stain my horse quite over with blood 
and double guild my spur but I will catch he 
so tell the caper boy and get thou go 

Edward of Wales Philip the second son 
to the most mighty christian king of France 
see thy body live date expire 
all full of charity and christian love 
commend this book full fraught with prayer 
to thy fair hand and for thy hour of life 
entreat thou that thou meditate therein 
and arm thy soul for her long journey towards 
thus have I do his bid and return 

herald of Philip greet thy lord from i 
all good that he can send I can receive 
but think thou not the unadvised boy 
have wrong himself in this far tender i 
happy he can pray without the book 
I think he no divine extemporal 
then render back this common place of prayer 
to do himself good in adversity 
beside he know not my sin quality 
and therefore know no prayer for my avail 
ere night his prayer may be to pray to God 
to put it in my heart to hear his prayer 
so tell the courtly wanton and be go 

I go 

how confident their strength and number make they 
now Audley sound those silver wing of thou 
and let those milk white messenger of time 
show thy time learn in this dangerous time 
thyself be busy and bite with many broil 
and stratagem sore pass with iron pen 
be text in thy honourable face 
thou be a marry man in this distress 
but danger woo i as a blush maid 
teach i a answer to this perilous time 

to die be all as common as to live 
the one in choice the other hold in chase 
for from the instant we begin to live 
we do pursue and hunt the time to die 
first bud we than we blow and after seed 
then present we fall and as a shade 
follow the body so we follow death 
if then we hunt for death why do we fear it 
if we fear it why do we follow it 
if we do tear how can we shun it 
if we do fear with fear we do but aid 
the thing we fear to seize on we the soon 
if we fear not than not resolve proffer 
can overthrow the limit of our fate 
for whether ripe or rot drop we shall 
as we do draw the lottery of our doom 

ah good old man a thousand thousand armour 
these word of thy have buckle on my back 
ah what a idiot have thou make of life 
to seek the thing it fear and how disgrace 
the imperial victory of murder death 
since all the life his conquer arrow strike 
seek he and he not they to shame his glory 
I will not give a penny for a life 
nor half a half penny to shun grim death 
since for to live be but to seek to die 
and die but begin of new life 
let come the hour when he that rule it will 
to live or die I hold indifferent 

a sudden darkness have deface the sky 
the wind be creep into their cave for fear 
the leaf move not the world be hush and still 
the bird cease sing and the wander brook 
murmur no wont greeting to their shore 
silence attend some wonder and expect 
that heaven shall pronounce some prophesy 
where or from who proceed this silence Charles 

our man with open mouth and stare eye 
look on each other as they do attend 
each other word and yet no creature speak 
a tonguetied fear have make a midnight hour 
and speech sleep through all the wake region 

but now the pompous sun in all his pride 
look through his golden coach upon the world 
and on a sudden have he hide himself 
that now the under earth be as a grave 
dark deadly silent and uncomfortable 
a clamour of raven hark what a deadly outcry do I hear 

here come my brother Philip 

all dismay what fearful word be those thy look presage 

a flight a flight 

coward what flight thou lie there needs no flight 

a flight 

awake thy craven power and tell on 
the substance of that very fear in deed 
which be so ghastly print in thy face 
what be the matter 

a flight of ugly raven 
do croak and hover over our soldier head 
and keep in triangle and corner square 
right as our force be embattle 
with their approach there come this sudden fog 
which now have hide the airy flower of heaven 
and make at noon a night unnatural 
upon the quake and dismay world 
in brief our soldier have let fall their arm 
and stand like metamorphose image 
bloodless and pale one gaze on another 

I now I call to mind the prophecy 
but I must give no entrance to a fear 
return and hearten up these yield soul 
tell they the raven see they in arm 
so many fair against a famish few 
come but to dine upon their handy work 
and pray upon the carrion that they kill 
for when we see a horse lay down to die 
although not dead the ravenous bird 
sit watch the departure of his life 
even so these raven for the carcase 
of those poor english that be mark to die 
hover about and if they cry to we 
it be but for meat that we must kill for they 
away and comfort up my soldier 
and sound the trumpet and at once dispatch 
this little business of a silly fraud 

behold my liege this knight and forty more 
of who the better part be slay and flee 
with all endeavour seek to break our rank 
and make their way to the encompass prince 
dispose of he as please your majesty 

go and the next bough soldier that thou see 
disgrace it with his body present 
for I do hold a tree in France too good 
to be the gallows of a english thief 

my lord of Normandy I have your pass 
and warrant for my safety through this land 

Villiers procure it for thou do he not 

he do 

and it be currant thou shall free pass 

I free to the gallow to be hang 
without denial or impediment 
away with he 

I hope your highness will not so disgrace i 
and dash the virtue of my seal at arm 
he have my never break name to show 
character with this princely hand of i 
and rather let i leave to be a prince 
than break the stable verdict of a prince 
I do beseech you let he pass in quiet 

thou and thy word lie both in my command 
what can thou promise that I can break 
which of these twain be great infamy 
to disobey thy father or thyself 
thy word nor no man may exceed his power 
nor that same man do never break his word 
that keep it to the utmost of his power 
the breach of faith dwell in the soul consent 
which if thyself without consent do break 
thou be not charge with the breach of faith 
go hang he for thy licence lie in i 
and my constraint stand the excuse for thou 

what be I not a soldier in my word 
then arm adieu and let they fight that list 
shall I not give my girdle from my waist 
but with a guardian I shall be control 
to say I may not give my thing away 
upon my soul have Edward prince of Wales 
engage his word write down his noble hand 
for all your knight to pass his father land 
the royal king to grace his warlike son 
will not alone safe conduct give to they 
but with all bounty feast they and they 

dwell thou on precedent then be it so 
say Englishman of what degree thou be 

a earl in England though a prisoner here 
and those that know i call i Salisbury 

then Salisbury say whether thou be bind 

to Callice where my liege king Edward be 

to Callice Salisbury then to Callice pack 
and bid the king prepare a noble grave 
to put his princely son black Edward in 
and as thou travel westward from this place 
some two league hence there be a lofty hill 
who top seem topless for the embrace sky 
do hide his high head in she a sure bosom 
upon who tall top when thy foot attain 
look back upon the humble vale beneath 
humble of late but now make proud with arm 
and thence behold the wretched prince of Wales 
hoop with a bond of iron round about 
after which sight to Callice spur amain 
and say the prince be smother and not slay 
and tell the king this be not all his ill 
for I will greet he ere he think I will 
away be go the smoke but of our shot 
will choke our foe though bullet hit they not 

how fare your grace be you not shoot my lord 

no dear artoys but choke with dust and smoke 
and step aside for breath and fresh air 

breath then and too it again the amaze french 
be quite distract with gaze on the crow

that will not yield his prisoner to my queen 

I be my liege a northern esquire indeed 
but neither proud nor insolent I trust 

what move thou then to be so obstinate 
to contradict our royal queen desire 

no wilful disobedience mighty lord 
but my desert and public law at arm 
I take the king myself in single fight 
and like a soldier will be loath to lose 
the least preeminence that I have win 
and Copland straight upon your highness charge 
be come to France and with a lowly mind 
do vale the bonnet of his victory 
receive dread lord the custom of my fraught

but to his person I will bend my knee 

I pray thou Philip let displeasure pass 
this man do please i and I like his word 
for what be he that will attempt great deed 
and lose the glory that ensue the same 
all river have recourse unto the sea 
and copland faith relation to his king

and to maintain thy state I free give 
five hundred mark a year to thou and thy 
welcome lord Salisbury what news from Britain 

this mighty king the country we have win 
and Charles de Mountford regent of that place 
present your highness with this coronet 
protest true allegiance to your grace 

we thank thou for thy service valiant earl 
challenge our favour for we owe it thou 

but now my lord as this be joyful news 
so must my voice be tragical again 
and I must sing of doleful accident 

what have our man the overthrow at Poitiers 
Oris our son beset with too much odds 

he be my lord and as my worthless self 
with forty other serviceable knight 
under safe conduct of the dolphin seal 
do travail that way find he distress 
a troop of Launce meet we on the way 
surprise and bring we prisoner to the king 
who proud of this and eager of revenge 
command straight to cut of all our head 
and sure we have die but that the duke 
more full of honour then his angry sire 
procure our quick deliverance from thence 
but ere we go salute your king quoth he 
bid he provide a funeral for his son 
today our sword shall cut his thread of life 
and soon than he think we will be with he 
to quittance those displeasure he have do 
this say we pass not dare to reply 
our heart be dead our look diffuse and wan 
wander at last we climb unto a hill 
from whence although our grief be much before 
yet now to see the occasion with our eye 
do thrice so much increase our heaviness 
for there my lord o there we do descry 
down in a valley how both army lay 
the french have cast their trench like a ring 
and every barricado open front 
be thick emboss with brazen ordinance 
here stand a battle of ten thousand horse 
there twice as many pike in quadrant wise 
here crossbow and deadly wound dart 
and in the midst like to a slender point 
within the compass of the horizon 
as it be a rise bubble in the sea 
a have wand a midst a wood of pine 
or as a bear fast chain unto a stake 
stand famous Edward still expect when 
those dog of France will fasten on his flesh 
anon the death procure knell begin 
off go the cannon that with tremble noise 
do shake the very mountain where they stand 
then sound the trumpet clangor in the air 
the battle join and when we can no more 
discern the difference betwixt the friend and so 
so intricate the dark confusion be 
away we turn our watery eye with sigh 
as black as powder fume into smoke 
and thus I fear unhappy have I tell 
the most untimely tale of Edward fall 

ah i be this my welcome into France 
be this the comfort that I look to have 
when I shall meet with my belove son 
sweet Ned I will thy mother in the sea 
have be prevent of this mortal grief 

content thou Philip it be not tear will serve 
to call he back if he be take hence 
comfort thyself as I do gentle queen 
with hope of sharp unheard of dire revenge 
he bid i to provide his funeral 
and so I will but all the peer in France 
shall mourner be and weep out bloody tear 
until their empty vein be dry and sere 
the pillar of his hearse shall be his bone 
the mould that cover he their city ash 
his knell the groan cry of die man 
and in the stead of taper on his tomb 
a hundred fifty tower shall burn blaze 
while we bewail our valiant son decease 

rejoice my lord ascend the imperial throne 
the mighty and redoubt prince of Wales 
great servitor to bloody Mars in arm 
the french man terror and his country fame 
triumphant ride like a roman peer 
and lowly at his stirrup come afoot 
king john of France together with his son 
in captive bond who diadem he bring 
to crown thou with and to proclaim thou king 

away with mourn Philip wipe thy eye 
sound trumpet welcome in Plantagenet 

as thing long lose when they be find again 
so do my son rejoice his father heart 
for who even now my soul be much perplex 

be this a token to express my joy kiss he 
for inward passion will not let i speak 

my gracious father here receive the gift 
this wreath of conquest and reward of war 
get with as much peril of our life 
as ere be thing of price before this day 
install your highness in your proper right 
and here withal I render to your hand 
these prisoner chief occasion of our strife 

so john of France I see you keep your word 
you promise to be soon with ourself 
then we do think for and it be so in deed 
but have you do at first as now you do 
how many civil town have stand untouched 
that now be turn to ragged heap of stone 
how many people life may thou have save 
that be untimely sink into their grave 

Edward recount not thing irrevocable 
tell i what ransom thou require to have 

thy ransom john hereafter shall be know 
but first to England thou must cross the sea 
to see what entertainment it afford 
however it fall it can be so bad 
as we have be since we arrive in France 

accurse man of this I be fortolde 
but do misconstrue what the prophet tell 

now father this petition Edward make 
to thou who grace have be his strong shield 
that as thy pleasure choose i for the man 
to be the instrument to show thy power 
so thou will grant that many prince more 
breed and bring up within that little isle 
may still be famous for like victory 
and for my part the bloody scar I bear 
the weary night that I have watch in field 
the dangerous conflict I have often have 
the fearful menace be proffer i 
the heat and cold and what else may displease 
I wish be now redouble twenty fold 
so that hereafter age when they read 
the painful traffic of my tender youth 
may thereby be inflame with such resolve 
as not the territory of France alone 
but likewise Spain Turkey and what country else 
that just will provoke fair England ire 
may at their presence tremble and retire 

here english lord we do proclaim a rest 
a intercession of our painful arm 
sheath up your sword refresh your weary limb 
peruse your spoil and after we have breathe 
a day or two within this haven town 
God will then for England we will be ship 
where in a happy hour I trust we shall 
arrive three king two prince and a queen
