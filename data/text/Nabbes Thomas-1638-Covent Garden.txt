unbounded by the strict limit of 
particular affection so I will keep it

shall make yourself the object of their courtship 
who bear perhaps but the empty name of gentleman 
without the real fullness 

what mean you brother by this introduction 

sister to take the privilege of discretion 
and school your ignorant courtesy that upon 
the shadow and appearance of man 
confer your favour 

brother you may pretend your love 
in this distrust but it be a ill expression 
think not my judgement subject to such weakness 
that I can build a faith on compliment 
or with rash passion run into a error 
nothing but know desert shall tie my thought

and when my choice be fix it shall be such 
as your fraternal love must not dispute 

sister my counsel be mild 
nor will I have you violent in defence

that scorn as much a act of foul dishonour 
as you or any masculine pretender 
to noble virtue gild be apt still 
to be suspicious if a maid be free 
in her discourse and courteous entertainment 
she straight be censure but let a man appear 
stick full of apish courtship light inconstant 
as talkative as parrot that be teach 
a voice imitation one that court 
every tame beauty with a seem zeal 
as if his soul devotion be restrain

what gratitude in i may equal this 

I know you be free 
and rather than a complemental servant 
shall be discourage in his serious wantonness 
you will give it countenance to make he bold 
in his amorous pursuit perhaps to the impudence 
of a lascivious charge upon your modesty 
because you scorn ingratitude 

brother do not the tie 
of love and nature check my forward aptness 
I will tell you you be not noble and suspect 
whether your mind hold that derivative goodness 
which generous blood communicate to suspect 
her resolute constancy who you call sister

through confidence of your appear virtue

and yet the child do give the parent form 
what riddle be in nature

of rude inanimate sense and understanding 
until inspire with love divine soul 
the sense be tire unless it vary object 
knowledge will be finite be not the mind 
delight with diversity 
but love be a subject for eternal study 
and one fair book preserve so a full library 

I be resolve I will nor spare man woman nor child while the sack work 

for woman and child let i alone if I fall upon the one I will soon get the other 

what fabulous error learning be attend with 
Plato five world their sempiternity 
Pythagoras transmigration and opinion

they make she all those world and then include 
all the fame excellence of former beauty 
in she more perfect frame 

be it possible such show of resolution 
shall appear in coward I will make they friend 
and that be do i own intention 
must be pursue to find that gentleman

if you be the son of sir generous worthy

nature and fortune do bestow on i 

it be indeed a blessing when the virtue 
of noble race be hereditary 
and do derive themselves from the imitation 
of virtuous ancestor you have a fair sister 

her beauty be not worth your commendation 

your modesty be too severe 
in your restraint from praise her pure excellence 
which shall be poet study not with fiction 
and common figure but divine attribute 
then they must call it nothing but itself 

have I find you I shall search you deep 

the subject weight will make a poem weighty 
and take away the imputation 
which seem solidness will throw upon it 
of a light fancy 

it seem you love my sister 

he be a devil do not love such goodness 
it be the only virtue frailty boast of 
to love fair sensual object but my soul 
have note inward beauty in her mind 
which make i glory though it be presumption 
that I do love she 

call it not presumption sir you do deserve she 
in that you have endear i for my life 
who be her brother and I commend you wit 
which I presume my sister love have whet 
it be a quaint plot Were the actor here again 
I will pay their wage 

your riddle need some Oedipus to solve it 

why sir ridiculous fable 
may sometime serve for imitation 
though it be a mere appointment in this rescue 
to show your love and valour 

what base suspicion 
poison his jealous thought it be injury 
beyond all patience 

Alas sir you be move 

yes to a indignation who just heat 
burn i almost to rage but there be charm 
and spell about you conjure down my spirit 
you be her brother 

it seem your guilt dare not deny the truth 

dare not deny it 
Were thy hand arm with thunder 
have thou a Gorgon look be it not her brother 
ring in the terror of a thousand gibbet 
and executioner I have a point 
shall find thy heart out 

but I must tell you sir 
seldom high spirit that pursue their honour 
with earnest flight will stoop at weak respect 
but prey upon the opinion of those man 
that scan their action tear their reputation 
out of suspicion bowel he be not a gentle man 
will not preserve his honour 

your speech sir 
savour of strange severity my honour 
be that part of myself without which 
the man that be in i can have no subsist 
honour be the great of exterior good 
and must be still pursue as the reward 
due unto virtue through the great danger 
yet fortitude be not the appetite 
of formidable thing nor inconsult 
rashness but virtue fight for a truth 
derive from knowledge of distinguish 
good or bad cause think i not a coward 
because I be not rash nor through defect 
of better counsel do not resist the force 
of will or passion howsoever your jealousy 
proceed from our better thought infection 
have be a provocation and perhaps 
the love I bear your sister will appear 
your chief safety 

in a attempt of right 
I have more safety here then your presence 
can arm I with but if you love my sister 
it must be honourable and not wanton 
she will find champion else 

I must be honourable 
those word include a doubt work strange in i 
love must not wrack my reputation 
sir I begin to scan the circumstance 
and construe your intention you will try i 
but your temptation have be too abusive 
and now my resolution be prepare 
to do my credit justice 

you will not fight with i that be her brother 

there be magic in those word 

I do presume my sister will reward you 
for these expression she be free to pay 
her servant promise wage be it kiss 
or any other dalliance 

what a profane breath from his black mouth fly 
will poison all the idolatrous religion 
that ever awe wicked mortal 
he be not sure her brother but some impostor 
that only counterfeit his worthy person 
I can be patient at the lie or coward 
or any thing that can make passion violent 
but her bright honour stained be a cause of justice 
to arm a nation draw if thou be a man 
and with the plea of valour if thou have any 
defend thy error draw thy sword 

not against he that love my sister 

be my just anger mock love make ridiculous 
draw lest I make myself a executioner 
and do a act of justice on thy guilt 

never against your bosom where a spirit 
so true noble dwell that have convert 
all my feign jealousy to useful love 

I be confound to amazement 

pray reconcile all your distraction 
let not the least distrust abuse your confidence 
of what I undertake my sister be you 
if the advice of i that be her brother 
and interest in her good or ill 
can be prevail 

then request sir 
that you will presume no more upon the privilege 
of that pure love I bear your virtuous sister 
to admit a jealousy of any action 
or thought of i which tend not unto nobleness 
next unto she my bosom hold you dear 
and shall do ever 

so i the like thus noble cause

through lust or wine from hateful cowardice
