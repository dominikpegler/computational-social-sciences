he be a infidel madam that will break his word with a lady 

I suspect servant you have many mistress 

nor by this white hand I must acknowledge there be some lady in the court in who eye and opinion I be favour I can obscure myself from their observation but my heart with contempt of all other endearment be only devote to your service 

be it not a charge to dress yourself in such variety of ribbon every day 

be that your scruple it be the mode to express our fancy upon every occasion to show the turn or present state of our hope or fear in our affection your colour to a understand lover carry the interpretation of the heart as plain as we express our meaning one to another in character shall I decipher my colour to you now here be azure and peach azure be constant and peach be love which signify my constant affection 

a pretty moral 

it save the trouble of write where the mistress and servant be learn in this amorous blazon yesterday I wear fuillemote greedeline and Isabel fuillemote be wither greedeline be absent and Isabel be beauty which put together express I do wither or languish for your absent beauty 

but be there any reason for their distinction 

yes lady for example your fuillemote be a wither leaf which do moralize decay your yellow be joy because

it be pity but there shall be some book write for our instruction in this art 

your hieroglyphic be the egyptian wisdom hebrew have their cabal the roman have their symbol and impreze and emblem but these be absolute your modern invention of character a alphabetical key trite and conspicuous your motto or rebus too open and demonstrative but the science and curiosity of your ribbon be not only instructive but a ornament and the near commentator of love for as love be entertain first by the eye or to speak more plain as the object affect be take in first by these optic which receive the species of thing colour and beautify so it be answerable to nature that in the progress of our passion we shall distinguish by our eye the change or constancy of our affection in apt and significant colour 

you have take pain to study this learned blazon 

it be the only gentile knowledge or philosophy in the world I will undertake to open any man or woman heart

Tell the most secret imagination and design conclude every passion and scruple if they be but careful to observe the artificial method of their colour 

why this may be a way of fortune tell too 

you say right lady physiognomy and chiromancy be but mere trifle your geomancy mere conjectural the erection of your scheme circumstantial and fallible but your quaint a la mode wear of your fancy more than astrological

be it possible you can talk thus and be no scholar 

I have travel in my fancy take the air about the world with the muse and do for my recreation of wit compose some wonder in verse poetical essay as one upon report of a heat that be in Egypt 

let we hear they 

in country I have be 
under the aequinoctial where I have see 
the sun disperse such a prodigious heat 
that make our sievelike skin to rain with sweat 
man will have give for a eclipse their life 
or one whisper of air yet each man strive 
to throw up grass feather nay woman too 
to find the wind all fall like lead none blue 
the dog star spit new fire till it come to pass 
each eye become his neighbour burn glass 
lean man do turn to ash present 
fat man do roast to lean anatomy 
young woman heat do get themselves with child 
for none but they themselves themselves defile 
old woman natural to witch turn 
and only rub one another burn 
the beast be bake skin turn to crust they say 
and fish in the river boil away 
bird in the air be roast and not burn 
for as they fall down all the way they turn 

most excellent 

I have see lark in that motion at fire with a engine of packthread perpendicular 

what will they have give for a shower in those country 

now you talk of a shower you shall hear another copy of verse that I make of a mighty rain which fall once in the Indies 

that you make if you will venture your lung let i hear some more impossible story to pass away the time 

heaven do not weep but in its swell eye 
whole sea of rheum and moist catarrh do lie 
which so bespawl the low world man see 
corn blast and the fruit of every tree 
air be condense to water against their wish 
and all their fowl be turn to fly fish 
like waterman they throng to ply a fair 
and think it have be navigable air 
beast lose the natural motion of each limb 
forget to go with practice to swim 
a trout now here you will not think how soon 
take ready dress for the empress of the moon 
the fix star though to our eye be miss 
we know yet be by their continual hiss 
woman be mermaid sail with the wind 
the great miracle be fish behind 
but man be all keep chaste against their wish 
and can commit but the cold sin of fish 

and that sin will puzzle all the civil lawyer in the kingdom sin of the flesh they be perfect in they know well enough what belong to adultery and simple fornication but you will much improve and oblige the practice of the court if you can bring this sin of fish under their commission but now I hope the rain be over and we shall have fair weather 

now can I tell you lady what a strange frost be in one part of the world 

I shall cry out fire if you do I will rather have some discourse to keep i warm 

or how the whole world be trouble with the wind colic

he look like one 

I put he to it he dare not fight and he that expect my favour to so high a degree as marriage must be none of my lord mayor whiffler he must be valiant in arm I be not take with a ring or a carcanet as some avaricious lady he that present i with the sword of his rival be more welcome than all the silken soft nature 600 a year widgeon that will be baffle in their best clothes and go down into the country every vacation like attorney to be beat against the next tear i and get damage by it but I forget some affair that concern i and take my leave your desert upon i be eminent and many and for all your noble service I will promise you nothing you apprehend i
