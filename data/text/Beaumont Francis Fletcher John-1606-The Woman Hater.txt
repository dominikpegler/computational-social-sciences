past four 

be it so much and yet the morn not up 
see yonder where the shamefaced maiden come 
into our sight how gentle do she slide 
hide her chaste cheek like a modest bride 
with a red veil of blush as be she 
even such all modest virtuous woman be 
why think your lordship I be up so soon 

about some weighty state plot 

and what think your knighthood of it 

I do think to cure some strange corruption in the common wealth 

you be well conceit of yourselves to think 
I choose you out to bear i company 
in such affair and business of state 
but be not I a pattern for all prince 
that break my soft sleep for my subject good 
be I not careful very provident 

your grace be careful 

very provident 

nay know you how my serious work plot 
concern the whole estate of all my subject 
I and their life then Lucio thou will swear 
I be a love prince 

I think your grace intend to walk the public street disguise to see the street disorder 

it be not so 

you secret will cross some other state that do conspire against you 

weighty far 
you be my friend and you shall have the cause 
I break my sleep thus soon to see a wench 

you be wondrous careful for your subject good 

you be a very love prince in deed 

this care I take for they when their dull eye 
be close with heavy slumber 

then you rise to see your wench 

what Milan beauty have the power to charm her sovereign eye and break his sleep 

sister to count Vaelore she be a maid 
will make a prince forget his throne and state

Lazarello what be he 

a courtier my lord and one that I wonder your grace know not for he have follow your court and your last predecessor from place to place any time this seven year as faithful as your spit and your drippingpan have do and almost as greasy

the very same my lord 

a courtier call thou he 
believe i Lucio there be many such 
about our court respect as they think 
even by ourself with thou I will be plain 
we prince do use to prefer many for nothing and to take particular and free knowledge almost in the nature of acquaintance of many who we do use only for our pleasure and do give large to number more out of policy to be think liberal and by that mean to make the people strive to deserve our love then to reward any particular desert of they to who we give and do suffer ourselves to here flatterer more for recreation 
then for love of it though we seldom hate it 
and yet we know all these and when we please 
can touch the wheel and turn their name about 

I wonder they that know their state so well shall fancy such base slave 

thou wonder Lucio 
do not thou think if thou be duke of Milan 
thou shall be flatter 

I know my lord I will not 

why so I think till I be duke I think I shall have leave i no more flatterer than there be now plaindealer and yet for all this my resolution I be most palpable flatter the poor man may loathe covetousness and flattery but fortune will alter the mind when the wind turn there may be well a little conflict but it will drive the billow before it

this fellow to be but a counterfeit 
one that do seem to loathe all woman kind 
to hate himself because he have some part 
of woman in he seem not to endure 
to see or to be see of any woman 
only because he know it be their nature 
to wish to taste that which be most forbid

farewell my hope my anchor now be break 
farewell my quondam joy of which no token 
be now remain such be the sad mischance 
where lady fortune lead the slippery dance

shall slip into the never satiate jaw 
of black despair no thou shall live and know 
thy full desire hunger thy ancient foe 
shall be subdue those gut that daily tumble 
through air and appetite shall cease to rumble 
and thou shall now at length obtain thy dish 
that noble part the sweet head of a fish 

then be I great than the duke 

there there be a notable piece of treason great than the duke mark that 

but how or where or when this shall be compass be yet out of my reach 

I be so true miserable that may I be now knock at the head with all my heart I will forgive a dog killer 

yet do I see through this confusedness some little comfort 

the plot my lord as ere you can of a woman discover 

Plot dangerous plot I will deserve by this most liberal 

it be from my head again 

o that it will stand i that I may fight or have some venture for it that I may be turn loose to try my fortune among the whole fry in a college or a inn of court or scramble with the prisoner in the dungeon nay be it set down in the outer court 
and all the guard about it in a ring 
with their knife draw which be a dismal sight 
and after twenty leisurely be tell 
I to be let loose only in my shirt 
to try the valour how much of the spoil 
I will recover from the enemy mouth 
I will accept the challenge

to have some wit in the court and to make fine jest 
upon country people in progress time and 
will thou lose this opinion for the cold head of a fish 
I say let it go I will help thou to as good a dish of meat 

God let i not live if I do not wonder 
man shall talk so profane 
but it be not in the power of loose word 
of any vain or misbelieve man
