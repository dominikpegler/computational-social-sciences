I will not lose she thou she most false father 
shall go along and if I miss she hear i 
whole day will I study to destroy thou 

I shall be joyful of it and so you will find i 

I hear and see too much of he and that 
compel i madam though unwilling 
to wish I have no uncle part in he 
and much I fear the comfort of a son 
you will not long enjoy 

it be not my fault 
and therefore from his guilt my innocence 
can be taint since his father death 
peace to his soul a mother prayer and care 
be never want in his education 
his childhood I pass as be bring up 
under my wing and grow ripe for study 
I overcome the tenderness and joy 
I have to look upon he and provide 
the choice master and of great name 
of Salamanca in all liberal art 

to train his youth up 
I must witness that 

how there he prosper to the admiration 
of all that know he for a general scholar 
be one of note before he be a man 
be still remember in that academy 
from thence I send he to the emperor court 
attend like his father son and there 
maintain he in such bravery and height 
as do become a courtier 

it be that spoil he my nephew have be happy 
the court be a school indeed in which some few 
learn virtuous principle but most forget 
whatever they bring thither good and honest 
trifle be there in practice serious action 
be obsolete and out of use my nephew 
have be a happy man have he never know 
what be there in grace and fashion 

I have hear yet 
that while he live in court the emperor 
take notice of his carriage and good part 
the grandee do not scorn his company 
and of the great lady he be hold 
a complete gentleman 

he indeed dance well 
a turn of the toe with a lofty trick or two 
to argue nimbleness and a strong back 
will go far with a madam it be most true 
that he be a excellent scholar and he know it 
a exact courtier and he know that too 
he have fight thrice and come off still with honour 
which he forget not 

nor I have much reason 
to grieve his fortune that way 

you be mistake 
prosperity do search a gentleman temper 
more than his adverse fortune I have know 
many and of rare part from their success 
in private duel raise up to such a pride 
and so transform from what they be that all 
that love they true wish they have fall in they 
I need not write example in your soon 
it be too apparent for ere don Duarte 
make trial of his valour he indeed be 
admire for civil courtesy but now 
he be swell so high out of his own assurance 
of what he dare do that he seek occasion 
unjust occasion ground on blind passion 
ever to be in quarrel and this make he 
shun of all fair society 

will it be 
in my weak power to help it I will use 
with my entreaty the authority of a mother 
as you may of a uncle and enlarge it 
with your command as be a governor 
to the great king in Lisbon 

here he come 
we be unseen observe he 

boy 

my lord 

what say the spanish captain that I strike 
to my bold challenge 

he refuse to read it 

why do not leave it there 

I do my lord 
but to no purpose for he seem more willing 
to sit down with the wrong than to repair 
his honour by the sword he know too well 
that from your lordship nothing can be get 
but more blow and disgrace 

he be a wretch 
a miserable wretch and all my fury 
be lose upon he hold the mask appoint 
in the honour of Hippolita 

it be break off 

the reason 

this be one they hear your lordship 
be by the lady choice to lead the dance 
and therefore they too well assure how far 
you will out shine they give it over and say 
they will not serve for foil to set you off 

they at their best be such and ever shall be 
where I appear 

do you note his modesty 

but be there nothing else pretend 

yes 
young don Alonzo the great captain nephew 
stand on comparison 

with who 

with you 
and open profess that all precedence 
his birth and state consider be due to he 
nor be your lordship to contend with one 
so far above you 

I look down upon he 
with such contempt and scorn as on my slave 
he be a name only and all good in he 
he must derive from his great grandsire ash 
for have not their victorious act bequeath 
his title to he and write on his forehead 
this be a lord he have live unobserved 
by any man of mark and die as one 
among the common rout compare with i 
it be giantlike ambition I know he 
and know myself that man be true noble 
and he may just call that worth his own 
which his desert have purchase I can wish 
my birth be more obscure my friend and kinsman 
of lesser power or that my provident father 
have be like to that riotous emperor 
that choose his belly for his only heir 
for be of no family then and poor 
my virtue wheresoever I live shall make 
that kingdom my inheritance 

strange self love 

for if I study the country law 
I shall so easy sound all their depth 
and rise up such a wonder that the pleader 
that now be in most practice and esteem 
shall starve for want of client if I travel 
like wise Ulysses to see man and manner 
I will return in act more know than 
Homer can fancy he if a physician 
so oft I will restore death wound man 
that where I live Galen shall not be name 
and he that join again the scatter limb 
of tear Hippolytus shall be forget 
I can teach Ovid courtship how to win 
a Julia and enjoy she though her dower 
be all the sun give light to and for arm 
be the persian host that drink up river add 
to the Turk present power I can direct 
command and marshal they 

and yet you know not 
to rule yourself you will not to a boy else 
like Plautus braggart boast thus 

all I speak 
in act I can make good 

why then be master 
of such and so good part do you destroy they 
with self opinion or like a rich miser 
hoard up the treasure you possess impart 
nor to yourself nor other the use of they 
they be to you but like enchant viand 
on which you seem to feed yet pine with hunger 
and those so rare perfection in my son 
which will make other happy render i 
a wretched mother 

you be too insolent 
and those too many excellency that feed 
your pride turn to a pleurisy and kill 
that which shall nourish virtue dare you think 
all blessing be confer on you alone 
you be gross cozen there be no good in you 
which other have not be you a scholar so 
be many and as know be you valiant

no long shall protect you for I vow 
though all that be past I pardon I will punish 
the next fault with as much severity 
as if you be a stranger rest assure on it 

and by that love you shall bear or that duty 
you owe a mother once more I command you 
to cast this haughtiness off which if you do 
all that be i be you if not expect 
my prayer and vow for your conversion only 
but never mean nor favour Exit Manuel and Guiomar

I only challenge for myself 

you have win she 
and well deserve she twenty year I have live 
a burgess of the sea and have be present 
at many a desperate fight but never see 
so small a bark with such incredible valour 
so long defend and against such odds 
and by two man scarce arm too 

it be a wonder 
and yet the courage they express be take 
and the contempt of death win more upon i 
then all they do when they be free methinks 
I see they yet when they be bring aboard we 
disarm and ready to be put in fetter 
how on the sudden as if they have swear 
never to taste the bread of servitude 
both snatch up their sword and from this virgin 
take a farewell only with their eye 
they leap into the sea 

indeed it be rare 

it wrought so much on i that but I fear 
the great ship that pursue we our own safety 
hinder my charitable purpose to they 
I will have take they up and with their life 
they shall have have their liberty 

o too late 
for they be lose for ever lose 

take comfort 
it be not impossible but that they live yet 
for when they leave the ship they be within 
a league of the shore and with such strength and cunning 
they swim do delude the rise billow 
with one hand make way and with the other 
their bloody sword advance threaten the seagod 
with war unless they bring they safe off 
that I be almost confident they live 
and you again may see they 

in that hope 
I brook a wretched be till I be 
make certain of their fortune but they dead 
death have so many door to let out life 
I will not long survive they

in our uncertain voyage be smooth gale 
compare to those the memory of my lust 
raise in my conscience and if ere again 
I live to see Zenocia I will sue 
and seek to she as a lover and a servant 
and not command affection like a tyrant 

in hear this you make i young again 
and heaven it seem favour this good change in you

give we fair hope to find that here in Lisbon 
which hitherto in vain we long have seek for 
I have receive assure intelligence 
such stranger have be see here and though yet 
I can learn their fortune nor the place 
of their abode I have a soul presage 
a fortunate event here 

there have pass 
a mutual interchange of courtesy 
between i and the governor therefore bold 
we may presume of he and of his power 
if we find cause to use they otherwise 
I will not be know here and these disguise 
will keep we from discovery 

what be these 

the governor with he my rival bind 

for certain it be Arnoldo 

let we attend 
what the success will be 

be it possible 
there shall be hope of his recovery 
his wound so many and so deadly 

so they appear at first but the blood stop 
his trance forsake he and on better search 
we find they be not mortal 

use all care 
to perfect this unhoped for cure that do 
propose your own reward and till you shall 
hear far from i for some end I have 
conceal it from his mother 

we will not fail sir Exit

if chastity 
in a young man and tempt to the height too 
do ere deserve reward or admiration 
he just may claim both love to his person 
or if you please give it a foul name 
compel i first to train he to my house 
all engine I raise there to shake his virtue 
which in the assault be useless he unmoved still 
as if he have no part of humane frailty 
against the nature of my sex almost 
I play the ravisher you may have see 
in our contention young Apollo fly 
and lovesick Daphne follow all art fail 
by flight he win the victory break from 
my scorn embrace the repulse in woman 
unsufferable invite i to practise 
a mean to be revenge and from this grow 
his accusation and the abuse 
of your still equal justice my rage ever

do in this woman house can chastity 
and hot lust dwell together without infection 
I will not be or jealous or secure

that she live be my bliss but live there 
a hell of torment there be no way to she 
in who I live but by this door through which

to keep we wake and rise in the morning

be solemnize with more tear of true sorrow 
then have be pay by your unequalled mother 
for your suppose death she be not acquaint 
with your recovery 

for some few day 
pray let she so continue thus disguise 
I may abroad unknown

to find out this stranger 
this true physician of my mind and manner
