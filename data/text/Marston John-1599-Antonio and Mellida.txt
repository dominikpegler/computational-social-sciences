my thought be fix in contemplation 
why this huge earth this monstrous animal 
that eat her child shall not have eye and ear 
philosophy maintain that nature be wise 
and form not useless or unperfect thing 
do nature make the earth or the earth nature 
for earthly dirt make all thing make the man 
mould i up honour and like a cunning Dutchman 
paint i a puppet even with seem breath 
and give a sot appearance of a soul 
go to go to thou lie philosophy 
nature form thing unperfect useless vain 
why make she not the earth with eye and ear 
that she may see desert and hear man plaint 
that when a soul be split sink with grief 
he may fall thus upon the breast of earth 
and in her ear halloo his misery 
exclaim thus o thou all bear earth 
which man do gape for till thou cram their mouth 
and choke their throat with dust oh chaune thy breast 
and let i sink into thou look who knock 
Andrugio call but oh she be deaf and blind 
a wretch but lean relief on earth can find 

sweet lord abandon passion and disarm 
since by the fortune of the tumble sea 
we be roll up upon the Venice marsh 
let we clip all fortune lest more lower fate 

More lower fate o Lucio choke that breath 
now I defy chance fortune brow have frown 
even to the utmost wrinkle it can bend 
her venom be spit Alas what country rest 
what son what comfort that she can deprive 
triumph not Venice in my overthrow 
gape not my native country for my blood 
lie not my son tomb in the swell main 
and yet more lower fate there be nothing leave 
unto Andrugio but Andrugio 
and that nor mischief force distress nor hell can take 
fortune my fortune not my mind shall shake 

speak like yourself but give i leave my lord 
to wish your safety if you be but see 
your arm display you therefore put they off 
and take 

will thou have i go unarm among my foe 
be besiege by passion enter list 
to combat with despair and mighty grief 
my soul beleaguer with the crush strength 
of sharp impatience ha Lucio go unarm 
Come soul resume the valour of thy birth 
myself myself will dare all opposite 
I will muster force a unvanquished power 
cornet of horse shall press the ungratefull earth 
this hollow wombed mass shall inly groan 
and murmur to sustain the weight of arm 
ghastly amazement with upstart hair 
shall hurry on before and usher we 
while trumpet clamour with a sound of death 

peace good my lord your speech be all too light 
Alas survey your fortune look what be leave 
of all your force and your utmost hope 
a weak old man a page and your poor self 

Andrugio live and a fair cause of arm 
why that be a army all invincible 
he who have that have a battalion 
royal armour of proof huge troop of barb steed 
main square of pike million of harquebus 
o a fair cause stand firm and will abide 
legion of angel fight upon her side 

then noble spirit slide in strange disguise 
unto some gracious prince and sojourn there 
till time and fortune give revenge firm mean 

no I will not trust the honour of a man 
gold be grow great and make perfidiousness 
a common water in most prince court 
he be in the checkroll I will not trust my blood 
I know none breathe but will cog a die 
for twenty thousand double pistolet 
how go the time 

I see no sun today 

no sun will shine where poor Andrugio breath 
my soul grow heavy boy let we have a song 
we will sing yet faith even despite of fate 

it be a good boy and by my troth well sing 
o and thou feltst my grief I warrant thou 
thou will have strike division to the height 
and make the life of music breath hold boy why so 
for god sake call i not Andrugio 
that I may soon forget what I have be 
for heaven name name not Antonio
