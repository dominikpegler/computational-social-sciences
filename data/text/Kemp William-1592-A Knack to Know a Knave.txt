Dunston how high be we bind to praise 
the eternal God that still provide for we 
and give we leave to rule in this our land 
like wise Vespasian Rome rich emperor 
suppress sinew that daily reign in we 
first murder we reward with present death 
and those that do commit felonious crime 
our law of England do award they death 
and he that do despoil a virgin chastity 
must likewise suffer death by law decree 
and that decree be irrevocable 
then as I be god vicegerent here on earth 
by god appointment here to reign and rule 
so must I seek to cut abuse down 
that like to Hydra head daily grow up one in another place 
and therein make the land infectious 
which if with good regard we look not to 
we shall like Sodom feel that fiery doom 
that God in justice do inflict on they 

your grace care herein I much commend 
and England have just cause to praise the lord 
that send so good a king to govern they 
your life may be a lantern to the state 
by perfect sign of humility 
how bless have Sodom be in sight of God 
if they have have so kind a governor 
they have then undoubted escape that doom 
that God in justice do inflict on they 
then England kneel upon thy hearty knee 
and praise that God that so provide for thou 
and virtuous prince thou Salomon of our age 
who year I hope shall double Nestor reign 
and bring a thousand profit to the land 
myself dread prince in token of my love 
and dutiful obedience to your grace 
will study daily as my duty will 
to root sin from the flourish common wealth 
that fame in every angle of the world 
may sound due praise of England virtuous king 

Dunston live thou and counsel still the king 
to maintain justice be it on himself 
rather than soothe he in his abuse 
to see subversion of his common wealth 
I tell thou Dunston thou have please the king 
and prove thyself a virtuous counsellor 
thy counsel be to i as north star light 
that guide the sailor to his wish port 
for by that star he be so comfort 
that he sail dangerless on dangerous sea 
and in his deep sadness comfort he 
so Dunston knowledge be that star of joy 
that will with help conduct i to my happiness 

and yet thou be not happy Edgar 
because that sin like swarm remain in thou 

why it be impossible for I have study still 
to root abuse from the common wealth 
that may infect the king or commonalty 
therefore base peasant wilful as thou be 
I tell thou troth thou have displease the king 

nay the king have displease himself 
in trust every one that speak he fair 
for through fair word king many time be fain 
to countenance knave by their authority 
I will not say your grace do so 

no sir you be not best 

why if I shall I may make good my word 
and find a knave I fear before I part 

why what be thou 

marry I go plain and my name be honesty 
a friend to your grace but a foe to flatterer 
and one that have a knack to know a knave 

as how sir by art or by some foolish gift God have give you 
you be some physician or skill in physiognomy or in palmistry 
for I be sure you can never do it by astronomy 
because there be no star to know a knave 

true but many a honest man know a knave to his cost 
and be neither visitian physiognomer palmister nor astronomer 
but a plain man of the country like i 
that know a knave if he do but see his cap 

that be pretty i'faith to see honesty know a knave by his cap 
it be more than I can do with all the skill I have 
but tell i I pray thou how I shall know a knave 

I believe you well for offender never bewray their offence 
till the law find they and punish they 
but you will fain tell how to know a knave 
then thus the first man you meet in the morning 
if he salute you draw near he 
and smell to his hat and after smell to your own 
and my cap to a noble if his smell like you he be a knave 
I think I speak with you now 

base villain be it not that the king presence do privilege thy presumption I will teach you to jest with your fellow 

forbear honesty thou be a good plain fellow 
and I commend thy wit that have such way to know a knave 

honesty be plain my lord but no good fellow 
for good fellow be pursetaker now a day 
and there be so many of such good fellow 
that honesty may walk the street without company 
not that there want company but honest company I mean 
and yet honesty can clap a knave on the shoulder for all his bravery 

why base companion mean you i 

not base sir because I be true beget 
for honesty may be suspect but never detect 
but you think I have a bailiff to my father as you have 
and that my mother can return a writ of error 
as you do when such a gallant as you be get 

believe i Perin he have touch you now 
and I perceive though honesty be simple 
yet many time he speak truth 

true if it please your grace for honest man will not lie 
but if your grace vouchsafe to give i leave 
you shall see i find more knave than one 
if my cunning fail i not or else say honesty have no honesty 

but tell i Dunston how think thou of this motion 
be it not good think thou we give he leave 
to stifle such caterpillar as corrupt the common wealth 
for many time such simple man as he 
bewray much matter in simplicity 
then tell i Dunston what think thou of his motion 

if it please your grace to think it good 
Dunston will say as once Hephestion do 
when Alexander win rich Macedon 
that whatsoever the king himself think meet 
he will in dutiful obedience yield unto 
and so say Dunston to your majesty 
for many time such simple man bring that to pass 
that wise head can attain unto 
for doubtless he have some device in hand 
whereby to find such subtle knavery 

well Dunston then as thou have counsel i 
I will for once make proof of honesty sirrah come hither 
in hope you will as your profession be 
in honest sort to find deceiver out 
and find they to give we notice straight 
that we may punish they for their amiss 
we give thou lean to work what mean thou may 
so it be not prejudice to the state nor we 

my gracious lord if honesty offend 
in any thing that he have promise 
and do not as your grace have give in charge 
stifle such caterpillar as corrupt the state 
let honesty receive such punishment 
as he deserve that leazes to the king 

honesty it be enough but tell i now what move thou first 
to undertake this task to visit we speak truth dissemble not 

if I shall tell your grace it will make you laugh 
to hear how honesty be entertain 
poor lame and blind when I come once ashore 
lord how they come in flock to visit i 
the shepherd with his hook and thrasher with his flail 
the very pedlar with his dog and the tinker with his male 
then come a soldier counterfeit and with he be his jug 
and will the whipper of the dog have get a bounce trug 
and cog dick be in the crew that swear he come from France 
he swear that in the king defence he lose his arm by chance 
and yet in conscience if I be put to swear 
I will be bind to lay a pound the knave be never there 
and happen among this company by chance one day 
I have no soon name my name but they run all away 
but now I will to my task and leave your grace 
and so I take my congee of your majesty 

honesty farewell and look unto your charge 

my gracious lord if I may not offend 
I will entreat a favour at your hand 
it be so I hear of late my gracious lord 
that my kind father lie at point of death 
and if my lord I shall not visit he 
the world I fear will find great fault with i 

nay Perin if your business be of weight 
we be content to give you leave to go 
provide this that you return again 
when you have see your father and your friend 

my gracious lord I will not stay there long 
only but see my father and return again 
till when my gracious lord I take my leave 

Perin farewell and tell i Dunston now we be alone 
what do thou think of beauteous Alfrida 
for she be report to be be pass fair 
they say she have a white pit in her chin 
that make her look like to the queen of love 
when she be dally with Endymion 
believe i Dunston if she be so fair 
she will serve our turn to make a concubine 
methinks it be good some time to have a love 
to sport withal and pass away the time 

ay my good lord Dunston can well allow of it 
if so your grace will marry Alfrida 

what will thou have i marry she I never see 
then man will say I dote on a wench 
but Dunston I have find a policy 
which must indeed be follow to the full 
earl Ethenwald welcome I think to send for you 
you must go do a message for we now 
it be nothing but to woo a wench which you can do 
you must not woo she for yourself but i 
tell she I sit and pine like Tantalus 
and if you can strain forth a tear for i 
tell she she shall be honour in my love 
and bear a child that one day may be king 
bid she not stand on term but send i word 
whether she be resolve to love i yea or no 
if she say not tell she I can enforce her love 
or it be no matter though you leave that out 
and tell she this we hear she be as wise 
as eloquent and full of oratory as Thaly be daughter of jupiter 
who speech be so please among the Greek 
that she be term a second Socrates 
for some report woman love to be praise 
then in my cause I pray thou love thou Alfrida 

my gracious lord and Ethenwald shall not fail 
to show his humble duty to your majesty 
I will my lord woe she in your behalf 
plead love for you and strain a sigh to show your passion 
I will say she be fair than the dolphin eye 
at who amaze the night star stand and gaze 
then will I praise her chin and cheek and pretty hand 
long make like Venus when she use the harp 
when Mars be revel in love high house 
beside my lord I will say she have a pace 
much like to Juno in idea vale 
when Argus watch the heifer on the mount 
these word my lord will make her love I be sure 
if these will not my lord I have better far 

nay this be well now Ethenwald be go 
for I shall long to hear of thy return 

my gracious lord I humble take my leave 

Ethenwald farewell Dunston how like thou this 
what have I do well in send Ethenwald 
but in good time how if he like the maid 
believe i Dunston than my game be mar 

I do not think my gracious lord 
my nephew Ethenwald bear that bad mind 
for hitherto he have be term just 
and keep your grace his gracious favourer 

true Dunston yet have I read that love 
have make the son receive the father oft 
but Dunston leave this come let we to court 

I will attend upon your majesty 

my son you see how age decay my state 
and that my life like snow before the sun 
gin to dissolve into that substance now 
from who enclosure grow my sire of life 
the earth I mean sweet mother of we all 
who death authorise by heaven high power 
shall bring at last from whence at first I come 
yet ere I yield myself to death my son 
give ear and hear what rule I set you down 
and first to thou my son that live by wit 
I know thou have so many honest sleight 
to shift and cousin smooth on thy wit 
to cog and lie and brave it with the best 
that it be but labour lose to counsel thou 
and therefore to the next Walter that seem in show a husbandman 
my son when that thy master trust thou most 
and think thou deal as true as himself 
be thou the first to work deceit to he 
so by that mean thou may enrich thyself 
and live at pleasure when thy master be dead 
and when to market thou be send with will 
put sand among it and it will make it weigh 
the weight twice double that it do before 
the overplus be thou into thy purse 
but now my son that keep the court 
be thou a mean to set the peer at strife 
and curry favour for the commons love 
if any but in conference name the king 
inform his majesty they envy he 
and if the king but move or speak to thou 
kneel on both knee and say God save your majesty 
if any man be favour by the king 
speak thou he fair although in heart thou envy he 
but who be next 

that be I father that use the word of God 
and live only by the heavenly manna 

who the priest give ear my son 
I have a lesson yet in store for thou 
thou must my son make show of holiness 
and blind the world with thy hypocrisy 
and sometime give a penny to the poor 
but let it be in the church or market place 
that man may praise thy liberality 
speak against usury yet forsake no pawn 
so thou may gain three shilling in the pound 
warn thou the world from sin and vile excess 
and now and then speak against drunkenness 
so by this mean thou shall be term wise 
and with thy pureness blind the people eye 
but now my son discourse to i in brief 
how you have live and how you mean to die 

then father thus live I that use i wit 
unto myself I love still to be wise 
for when I be drive to shift for meat or coin 
or gay apparel to maintain i brave 
then do I flaunt it out about the change 
as if I be some land gentleman 
and fall in with some rich merchant there 
I take commodity for six month day 
the bill be make I must set to my hand 
then if I pay not they may burn the band 

then father hark how I have profit 
Walter your son that keep the country 
I have raise the market and oppress the poor 
and make a thousand go from door to door 
and why do I think you use this extremity 
because I will have corn enough to feed the enemy 
father you know we have but a while to live 
then while we live let each man shift for one 
for he that can not make shift in the world 
they say he be unworthy to live in it 
and he that live must still increase his store 
for he that have most wealth of all desire more 

brethren you have speak well I must needs say 
but now give ear to i to i that keep the court 
father I live as Aristippus do and use my wit to flatter with the king 
if any in private conference name the king 
I straight inform his grace they envy he 
do Sinon live with all his subtlety 
he can not tell a flatter tale more cunning 
some time I move the king to be effeminate 
and spend his time with some coy courtesan 
thus with the king I curry favour still 
though with my heart I wish he any ill 
and sometime I can counterfeit his hand and seal 
and borrow money of the communality 
and thus I live and flaunt it with the best 
and dice and card inferior unto none 
and none dare speak against i in the court 
because they know the king do favour i 

and I among my brethren and my friend 
do still instruct they with my doctrine 
and yea and nay go through the world with we 
fie not a oath we swear for twenty pound 
brethren say we take heed by Adam fall 
for by his sin we be condemn all 
thus preach we still unto out brethren 
though in our heart we never mean the thing 
thus do we blind the world with holiness 
and so by that be term pure precisian 

full well and wise have you say my son 
and I commend you for your forward mind 
that in your life bewray who son you be 
here have I be a bailiff three score year 
and use exaction on the dweller by 
for if a man be bring before my face 
for cozenage theft or live on his wit 
for counterfeit any hand or seal 
the matter hear the witness bring to i 
I take a bribe and set the prisoner free 
so by such deal I have get the wealth 
which I will have disburse among you all 
with this proviso that you all shall live 
and lead such life as I have set you down 
carve to yourselves and care not what they say 
that bid you fear the fearful judgement day 
live to yourselves while you have time to live 
get what you can but see you nothing give 
but hark my son methinks I hear a noise 
and ghastly vision make i timorous 
ah see my son where death pall death appear 
to summon i before a fearful judge 
methinks revenge stand with a iron whip 
and cry repent or I will punish thou 
my heart be harden I can repent 
ah hark methinks the judge do give my doom 
and I be damn to ever burn fire 
soul be thou safe and body fly to hell 

brother why do you not read to my father 

true my book of exhortation be at my place of exercise and without it I can do nothing God peace be with he 

father say on for now my leisure serve 
and Edgar give thou leave to tell thy mind 
for I perceive thy eye be full of tear 
which show that many inward passion trouble thou 
if any here have wrong thy age year 
in keep that from thou that be thy due 
name but the man and as I be England king 
thou shall have all the favour I can show 

then virtuous prince mirror of courtesy 
who judgement and who law for government 
and punish of every foul abuse 
be like the judgement of great Alexander 
three of that name who some term the severe 
or like Vespasian Rome virtuous governor 
who for a blow his son do give a swain 
do straight command that he shall lose his hand 
then virtuous Edgar be Vespasian once 
in give sentence on a graceless child 
know virtuous prince that in my pride of year 
when lustful pleasure prick my wanton mind 
even in the April of my flourish time 
I be betroth and wed to a wife 
by who too soon I have that unkind boy 
who disobedience to his age sire 
the lord will plague with torment worse than death 
this disobedient child nay base abstranogant 
who I with care do nourish to this state 
puff with a pride that upstart courtier use 
and see that I be bring to poverty 
he do refuse to know i for his sire 
and when I challenge he by nature law 
to yield obedience to his father age 
he tell i straight he take it in great scorn 
to be beget by one so base as I 
my age that ill can brook his sharp reply 
do with this wand my lord reach he a blow 
but he contrary law of God and man 
do strike i such a blow in vild disdain 
that with the stroke I fall to earth again 

unkind Philarchus how have thou misdo 
in wilful disobedience to thy sire 
be thou grow proud because I favour thou 
why I can quick make thou bare again 
and then I think be in thy former state 
thou will remember who thy father be 
and gentle Sophocles in good time I recount 
thy ancient say not so old as true 
for say he that have many child 
shall never be without some mirth 
nor die without some sorrow for if they 
be virtuous he shall have cause to rejoice 
but if vicious stubborn or disobedient 
ever to live in continual sadness 
I be sorry Philarchus that my favour have make thou insolent 
well I will see now if my frown will make thou penitent 
now father see how nature begin to work 
and how salt tear like drop of peely dew 
fall from his eye as sorrow his amiss 

most gracious prince vouchsafe to hear i speak 
I can but confess most gracious sovereign 
that I have err in be obstinate in wilful disobedience to my sire 
wherein I have wrong nature and your majesty 
but I be not the first who oversight 
have make forgetful of a father love 
but father love shall never be forget 
if he but deign to pardon my amiss 
but if your wrath will no way be appease 
rip up this breast where be enclose that heart 
that bleed with grief to think on my amiss 
ah father pardon sweet father pardon i 

no graceless imp degenerate and unkind 
thou be no son of i but tiger whelp 
that have be foster by some lion pap 
but as the tall ash be cut down because it yield no fruit 
and a unprofitable cow yield no milk be slaughter 
and the idle drone gather no honey be contemn 
so ungrateful child that will yield no natural obedience 
must be cut off as unfit to bear the name Christian 
who live digress both from reason and humanity 
but as thou have deal unnatural with i 
so I resolve to pull my heart from thou 
therefore dread prince vouchsafe to pity i 
a grant I may have justice on my son 

Dunston how counsel thou the king in this 
I promise thou I be sorry for the youth 
because in heart I ever wish he well 

my gracious lord if I may counsel you 
I will counsel you to judge as be deserve 
he that disdain his father in his want 
and wilful will disobey his sire 
deserve my lord by god and nature law 
to be reward with extreme ill 
then as your grace have establish law for government 
so let offender feel the penalty 

i Dunston now thou speak as fit a counsellor 
but not as friend to he who Edgar love 
father what will thou have i do in this 
thou see thy son be sorry for his fault 
and I be sure thou will not wish his death 
because a father care command the contrary 
then gentle father let i plead for he 
and be his pledge for shun wilful ill 

will Edgar now be find a partial judge 
in plead pardon for a graceless child 
be it not true that one coal of fire will burn many house 
and one small brack in fine cloth that be 
will both disgrace and blemish the whole piece 
so wilful child spot with one ill 
be apt to fall to twenty thousand more 
and therefore mighty sovereign leave to speak 
and pass just sentence on Philarchus life 

my life dear father that sentence be too hard 
let i be banish from my country bound 
and live as exile in some wilderness 
bar from society and sight of man 
or let i hazard fortune on the sea 
in set i aboard some helmless ship 
that either I may split upon so i rock 
or else be swallow in the purple main 
rather than die in presence of my king 
or bring that sorrow to your age year 
if this suffice not then let i be arm 
and leave alone among thousand foe 
and if my weapon can set i free 
let they be mean to take my life from i 

father what say you to Philarchus now 
be you content to pardon his amiss 
Dunston I promise thou it grieve i much 
to hear what piteous moan Philarchus make 
 
and his humility argue he penitent 
but father for I will not be the judge 
to doom Philarchus either life or death 
here take my robe and judge he as thou will 

then virtuous prince see you will have it so 
although the place be far unfit for i 
I be content your grace shall have your mind 
thus like a ass attire in costly robe 
or like a ring thrust in a foul sow snout 
so do these robe and sceptre fit my age 
but for I be judge Philarchus stand thou forth 
and know as there be nothing so good but it have some inconvenience 
so there be no man whatsoever without some fault 
yet this be no argument to maintain thy wilful disobedience 
as the rose have his prickle the fine velvet his brack 
the fair flower his bran so the best wit his wanton will 
but Philarchus thou have be more than wanton 
because thou have disobey the law both of God and nature 
the tear that thou have shed may warrant i 
that thou be penitent for thy amiss 
beside my son a father natural care 
do challenge pardon for thy first amiss 

father well say I see thou pity he 

nay stay my lord this do I speak as father to Philarchus 
but now my lord I must speak as a judge 
and now Philarchus mark what I set down 
because thou have be disobedient 
and wrong thy age father wilful 
and give a blow to he that nourish thou 
and thereby have incur thy mother curse 
and in that curse to feel the wrath of God 
and so be hate on the earth among man 
and for I will be find no partial judge 
because I sit as God vicegerent now 
here I do banish thou from England bound 
and never to 

there stay now let i speak the rest 
Philarchus thou have hear thy father doom 
and what thy disobedience move he to 
yet for thou be once bedfellow to the king 
and that I love thou as my second self 
thou shall go live in France in Flanders Scotland or else where 
and have annual pension send to thou 
there may thou live in good and honest sort 
until thou be recall by the king 

thank gracious king for this great favour show 
and may I never live if I forget 
your grace kind and unexpected love 
in favour he who all the world forsake 
for which my orison shall still be spend 
heaven may protect your princely majesty 
And love father here upon my knee 
sorry for my amiss I take my leave 
both of yourself my king and countryman 
England farewell more dear unto i 
than pen can write or heart can think of thou 

farewell Philarchus and father come to court 
and for Philarchus sake thou shall not want 

thank virtuous king I humble take my leave 

Dunston I promise thou I be like to weep 
to hear what piteous moan Philarchus make 

here your grace have show yourself to be 
Edgar so fame for love and virtuous government 
and I pray God your grace may live to be 
long England king to reign with verity

by that time I have do but I must about my business 
to find some knack to know this knave at large 

the night draw on and Phoebus be decline towards the west 
now shepherd bear their flock unto the fold 
And winter Dren fodder in their stall 
now leave to feed and begin to take their rest 
black dusky cloud environ round the globe 
and heaven be cover with a sable robe 
now be I come to do the king command 
to court a wench and win she for the king 
but if I like she well I say no more 
it be good to have a hatch before the door 
but first I will move her father to prefer 
the earnest suit I have in canvas 
so may I see the maid woo wed I and bed she to 
who be here what ho 

earl Ethenwald welcome how fare our friend at court

tush fear not you for you never know honest man dissemble with his friend 
though many friend dissemble with honest man 
but my lord the card be shuffle and here come a knave 

it be strange to see how man of our knowledge live 
and how we be hate of the base sort 
because forsooth we live upon our wit 
but let the base sort think as they will 
for he may best he term a gentleman 
that when all fail can live upon his wit 
and if all fail then have I get a wench 
that cut and deal to maintain my expense 
now I use she as man use sweet flower 
that while they be sweet and pleasant to the eye 
I do regard they for their pleasant smell 
but when their colour fade and send decay 
I cast they off for man to trample on 
but to the purpose here be the gentleman 
my honest friend do late tell i of 
sir though I have another business of import 
that may have hinder i for come here

how I will labour to requite your courtesy 
this be the honest man I tell you of

that at my house you see i pay three hundred pound 
and for your pain I will give you a hundred pound 
beside I will stand your friend in what I may 
you hear the cause what will your conscience serve you to do it 

How say you sir my conscience than you touch i 
I tell you sir my conscience will serve i to do more than this 
why I have be a post knight in Westminster this xii year 
and swear to that which no one else will venture on 
why I have swear against my own father for money 
I have swear right or wrong any way for money 
when I have receive money before witness I swear to the contrary 
and do you misdoubt i in so slight a matter as this 
when I have swear against father mother and all my kin 

I tell you sir how resolute you shall find he 
he do it without fear I warrant you 
I think that in London you can not have find a man so fit for your purpose 
I know his father sir a man of honest reputation 
and one who life be witness to the life he lead 
he be a bailiff sir though I say it but no bailiff that use deceit 
he have too good a conscience for that 

all the better for that for it shall seem by his behavior 
that he have have good bring up 

Indeed my father in his life time be a man 
give to the fear of God and to use much devotion 

ay but he give nothing for god sake except it be hard word or blow and they have be better keep that give but hush here come the judge 

hear you sir if you be in readiness here be the judge 

ay sir fear not I warrant you be that your adversary 
what a old crust it be 

I think the villain have a face harden with steel 
he can never be so impudent else 

it it please your worship this be the man 
that wrongful will have my farm from i 
face i down that he have pay i that 
which he never offer nor I never receive 
and this day he have promise to make proof 
that he have pay i full four hundred pound 

and so I can and here be my witness to it 
that see i when I pay the money 

why I be sure he will not say it 
I never see the man in all my life 

no sir but I see you and be a witness 
when this gentleman pay you three hundred pound 
as the last payment for the farm he buy 

but where be the money tender 

at the gentleman house 

you see father this merchant will be witness 
that he see so much money tender 
and you receive it be full satisfy 
as the last payment for the farm he buy 
and if this merchant take his oath against you 
that seven day past he see the money tender 
I must pass sentence then against you needs 
but will you swear on the bible this be true 

ay sir and to that intent I come hither 
for I will never refuse to swear a truth while I live 

yet ere thou speak vouchsafe to hear i speak 
full three score winter gentle sir I have pass 
and age have bring grey hair upon my head 
look but upon my face and thou shall see 
the perfect pattern of humility 
thou man of worth or citizen whatever thou be 
weigh but my charge and then thou will not swear 
I have five son all pretty tender babe 
that live upon the farm that he will have 
twelve hundred sheep do feed upon the plain 
that year lie bring a great increase to i 
beside a hundred ox fat feed 
that every winter feed within my stall 
and twenty poor man live near my house 
I daily feed and all upon my farm 
go but among my neighbour where I dwell 
and hear what good report they give of i 
the poor man never yet go from my door 
but to my power I do relieve his want 
I be no farmer that enrich myself 
by raise market and oppress poor 
but I have sell my corn full many time 
at better rate than I can well afford 
and all to help my needy brethren 
then ere thou swear call all these thing to mind 
and thou will weep and leave to swear untruth 
confusion to thy body and thy soul 

well if thou be well advise take thy oath 
but yet remember before who thou swear 
the god of truth and perfect equity 
which will revenge wrong to the innocent 
with thousand plague and torture worse than death 

by the holy content of this bible 
and by that just God before who I stand I see this man 

peace shameless villain execrable wretch 
monster of nature degenerate miscreant 
whoever know or hear so vile a oath 
vild pronounce by such a damn slave 
have I such monstrous viper in my land 
that with their very breath infect the air 
say Dunston have thou ever hear the like 

my liege such loathsome weed must needs infect the corn 
such canker perish both the root and branch 
unless they be soon spy and weed out 

I will be the husbandman to mow such tare 
here honesty let he be manacle 
and scar his forehead that he may be know 
as Cain for murder he for perjury 
coneycatcher I beseech your grace be good to i 
Hon I you shall have a cold iron clap in your forehead 
A hot one I will say you be a slave indeed 
Conicatcher good honesty 

good villain there be no help for you 

my fancy thought like the labour spider 
that spread her net to entrap the silly fly 
or like the restless billow of the sea 
that ever alter by the fleet air 
still hover past their wont passion 
make i amaze in these extremity 
the king command i on his embassage 
to Osrick daughter beauteous Alfrida 
the height and pride of all this bound ill 
to post amain plead love in his behalf 
to court for he and woo and wed the maid 
but have you never hear that theme 
deceit in love be but a merriment 
to such as seek a rival to prevent 
whether distraught roam my unruly thought 
it be the king I cousin of his choice 
and he will brook earl Ethenwald shall prove 
false to his prince especial in love 
then thus it shall be I will tell the king the maid be fair 
of nut brown colour comely and fair speak 
worthy companion to a earl or so 
but not a bride for Edgar England king 
this will allay the strong effect in love 
fame wrought in Edgar mind of Alfrida 
well I will to court and dally with the king 
and work some mean to draw his mind from love 

neighbour Walter I can but admire to see 
how housekeeping be decay within this thirty year 
but where the fault be God know I know not 
my father in his life time give hospitality to all stranger and 
distress traveler his table be never empty of bread beef 
and beer he be wont to keep a hundred tall man in his hall 
he be a feaster of all comer in general 
and yet be he never in want of money 
I think God do bless he with increase for his bountiful mind 

Truly sir I be sorry you be fall into decay 
in that you want to maintain household charge 
and whereof come this want I will tell you sir 
it be only throw your great housekeeping 
be rule by i and do as I advise you 
you must learn to leave so great a train of man 
and keep no more than needs of force you must 
and those you keep let they be simple man 
for they will be content with simple fare 
keep but a boy or two within your house 
to run of errant and to wait on you 
and for your kitchen keep a woman cook 
one that will serve for thirty shilling a year 
and by that mean you save two livery 
and if you will keep retainer towards you 
let they be farmer or rich husbandman 
for you shall find great profit sir in keep they 
for if you stand in need of corn or hay 
send but to they and you may have it straight 
and if you kill a beef let it be so lean 
the butcher nor the grazier will not buy it 
your drink be too strong and taste too much of malt 
tush single beer be better far both for your profit and your servant health 
and at a Christmas time feast none at all 
but such as yield you some commodity 
I mean such as will send you now and then 
fat goose and capon to keep house withal 
to these and none else will I have you liberal 

why neighbour my good be lend i to no other end 
but to relieve my needy brethren but God I hope have in store for i 

ay trust you to that and you may hap die a beggar 

why sir if he shall not trust in God in who shall he trust for God be the giver of all good whatsoever 

true and yet it be good for a man to trust to himself now and then for if you be down and bid God help you up and do not help yourself you may fortune lie and perish and therefore serve God on Sunday as you be appoint and thereby hope to be save for by your alm deed you can for if you give to the poor there be many will say he think to be save by his alm deed and thus you shall be ill think on for your good will and therefore learn to provide for yourself let God provide for the poor 

I tell you neighbour my great grandfather and all my predecessor have be hold in good regard for their good housekeeping and God will their good name shall never take a exigent in i for I will God will keep such hospitality to my death as my state can maintain and I will rather sell my land to maintain housekeeping then keep my land make sale of my good name for housekeeping but stay who come here 

God save you sir I pray be good to i for I be a poor man and I can tell what you will do for you say my horse have break into your corn or your corn into my horse but indeed my neighbour see your boy drive my horse into a field but I will stand to nothing now I be warn with a piece of paper and a little wax to prepare or proceed to London and there I be invent I can tell for what the bailiff here have arrest i ere I be weary against my will he say it be upon your suit and yet he lay his hand on i nay more on my shoulder 

and sir and it may please you I borrow certain corn and I bring you your corn again and yet you rest i 

true sir but then be corn sell for four shilling a bushel and now it be sell for two 

ay sir but he borrow corn and promise to pay you corn again and you can have but so much as you lend 
for if he shall pay you at the rate you demand 
you will have for the twenty bushel you lend forty 
which be neither right nor conscience 

o sir I pray let i alone with my conscience 
you will have i give all I have away to the poor and want as you do I pray let i alone to deal for myself hear you have you rest they 

I have sir as you command i 

then to prison with they till they have pay such damage as the law shall award they 

Hear you sir if you shall bid your boy break down a gap and drive in my horse it be little better than plain knavery for my horse be as honest a horse as any be in this town 

well neighbour we will have the horse examine before a officer and my boy jack shall write what the horse speak and if the horse say a be drive in against his will 
then you may have the law of he neighbour 
for all the horse in the parish will be swear for his horse 
but I will stand to nothing 

well to prison with they till they have pay your due away with they 

nay I pray be more miserable to i and I will give you forty shilling when I have it 

by the mass the knave have a pretty cottage 
I will see and I can get that sirrah you have a old cottage 
if you will make i that over by deed of gift 
I be content to draw my action 

my house why it be my good my wife my land 
my horse my ass or any thing that his he no you caterpillar 
I will never make away my house I will die first 

but tell i sir how much will you have of they for their trespass 

marry for forty shilling and yet I befriend they 
why sir I hope you will not pay it for they 

but I will sirrah Bailie I will answer the poor man debt and come home to I for thy fee anon go old man 
get you home and praise God

too few neighbour the more be the pity 
but come let we away 

but who come she 

God save you gentleman the king greet you and at this time have some occasion to use money have send to know 
what you that be knight and squire will lend his grace 
and you master farmer be brief sir for I can stay

to lend the king a hundred or two of pound 
and hear you sir if you prefer a suit I have to the king 
I will give you forty angel for your pain 
beside I will give you the keep of a dozen jade 
and now and then meat for you and your horse 
if you come to my house and lie a whole year 

why that be well say and I commend thy honest mind 
will all man be of thy mind 
I warrant thou thou be a honest man and one that love the king 
but tell i what will thou have i do 

nothing but procure i the king letter to convey corn beyond sea for in England it be so good cheap that a man can make no live by sell thereof therefore if the king will grant i his letter I will at any time lend he five or six hundred and perhaps never ask it again and I will not forget your pain 

sir fear not I will do it for you I warrant you for I tell you I can do much with the king

so shall thy virtue be admire at the court 
and thou be praise for kind and debonair 
for courtesy content a courtier oft 
when nothing else seem pleasant in his eye 

father you shall perceive that Alfrida 
will do her best in honour of your age 
to entertain the earl of Cornwell so 
that he shall think he high favour 
throw love speech and courteous entertain 

how fare my L of Cornwall what displease

nor do it ever trouble i till now 
for till I come to lodge within your house 
my eye be clear and I never feel the pain

and see if you can ease he of his pain

any of which if it please your honour use they

but stay not long for I shall hardly brook your absence then 

fear not Alfrida I will not stay there long 
but come let we in father pray lead the way 

tell i Dunston what think thou of the favor of king 

I think of king favor as of a marigold flower 
That as long as the Sun shine open her leaf 
and with the least cloud close again 
or like the violet in America that in summer yield a odiferous smell 
and in winter a most infectious savour 
for at every full sea they flourish or at every dead open they vade 
the fish palerna be perfect white in the calm 
yet turn black with every storm 
or like the tree in the desert of Africa 
that flourish but while the southwest wind blow 
even so my lord be the favour of king to they they favour 
for as their favour give life so their frown yield death 

well say Dunston but what merit he that dissemble with his sovereign 

in my opinion my lord he merit death 

then assure thyself if Ethenwald dissemble he shall die but who come here Perin what news that thou come in such haste and what be he that bear thou company 

it be my gracious lord and honest man 
and one it seem that love you majesty 
for as your grace give i in charge 
I go about into the country to see what sum of money I can make 
among the chief of the commonalty 
and among the rich knight that I can find 
they will lend your grace at most but twenty pound 
and every squire will lend you grace but ten 
then come I among the rest to this plain man 
and ask he what he will lend the king 
he answer sir you see I be but poor 
not half so wealthy as a knight or squire 
and yet in sign of duty to his grace 
I will lend his majesty two hundred pound 

thank honest fellow for thy love to we 
and if I may but pleasure thou in aught 
command i to the uttermost I may 
England have too few man of thy good mind 
honesty what news where have thou be so long

and make poor Piers ploughman wear a thread bare coat

that the ploughman coat be of good homespun russet cloth 
whereof neither I nor my servant have no want 
though now both they and I want

for there can be a acre of ground to be sell 
but he will find money to buy it nay my lord he have money 
to buy whole lordship and yet but a farmer

assize now shall your grace see 
how honesty can shake out a knave in this company 
sirrah tell i who have most poor man in suit at this syses

he have one poor man in suit for certain barley 
and another for that his horse be take in his corn 

but what indictment be against he read they 

first he have convey corn out of the land to feed the enemy next he have turn poor Piers ploughman out of door by his great raise of rent 
next he be know to be a common disturber of man of their quiet by serve writ on they and bring they to London to their utter undo 
also he keep corn in his barn and suffer his brethren and neighbour to lie and want and thereby make the market so dear that the poor can buy no corn

to seek the utter undo of many to enrich thyself

when such fair face bear we company 
fair Polyxena never be so fair 
nor she that be proud love to Troilus 
great Alexander love queen of Amazon 
be not so fair as be fair Alfrida 
but Perin be thou secret to the king 
and I will sound these subtle practice 
and Ethenwald be sure I will quittance thou 
and teach thou how to dally with thy king 
but Perin let we to court until to morn 
and then we will take horse and away 

now let we consult among ourselves 
how to misbehave ourselves to the king worship 
jesus bless he and when he come to deliver he this petition 
I think the smith be best to do it for he be a wise man 

neighbour he shall not do it as long as jefferay the 
translater be mayor of the town 

and why I pray because I will have put you from the mace 

no not for that but because he be no good fellow 
nor he will not spend his pot for company 

why sir there be a god of our occupation and I charge you by virtue of his godhead to let i deliver the petition 

but soft you your god be a cuckold and his godhead be the horn and that be the arm of the godhead you call upon go your be put down with your occupation and now I will not grace you so much as to deliver the petition for you

Come Dunston let we away 

Ethenwald be advise the king have send to thou 
nay more he mean to come and visit thou 
but why I there be the question 
why it be for this to see if he can find 
a front whereon to graft a pair of horn 
but in plain term he come to cuckold i 
and for he mean to do it without suspect 
he send i word he mean to visit i 
the king be amorous and my wife be kind 
so kind I fear that she will quick yield 
to any motion that the king shall make 
especial if the motion be of love 
for Pliny write woman be make like wax 
apt to receive any impression 
who mind be like the janamy●● 
that eat yet cry and never be satisfy 
well be as it be for I will be sure of this 
it shall be no way prejudice to i 
for I will set a screen before the fire 
and so prevent what otherwise will ensue 
it be good I question with my father first 
to hear how he affect towards the king 
what ho 

Ethenwald my son what news 

why ask you I be sure you have hear the news 

not year I promise you my lord

that he may know how Osrick honour he 
and I will be attire in cloth of Bis 
beset with orient pearl fetch from rich indian 
and all my chamber shall be rich 
with arras hang fetch from Alexandria 
then will I have rich counterpoint and musk 
Calamon and Casia sweet smell amber Greece 
that he may say Venus be come from heaven 
And leave the god to marry Ethenwald 

zwouns they be both agree to cuckold i 
but hear you wife while I be master of the bark 
I mean to keep the helmster in my hand 
my meaning be you shall be rule by i

nor shall he see thou now if I can choose 
for thou shall be attire in some base weed 
and Kate the kitchen maid shall put on thou

I promise thou Ethenwald I like she well 

my lord she be a homely kitchen maid 
and one who bring up have be but rude 
and far unfit for Edgar company 
but if your grace want merry company 
I will send for lady wise and courteous 
to be associate with your majesty 
or if you grace will have musician send for 
I will fetch your grace the best in all this land

and therefore if you love i send for she 
for till she come I can be content 

father I will not fetch she zwouns see where she come 

successful fortune and his heart content 
daily attend the person of the king 
and Edgar know that I be Alfrida daughter to Osrick 
and late make the earl of Cornwall wife

who Ethenwald in too much love to i 
have thus attire to dally with the king 

by my troth my lord she lie go to I will course you by and by 

away base strumpet get thou from my sight 

go your way you be a cog knave I warrant you 

base Ethenwald dissembler that thou be 
so to dissemble with thy sovereign 
and afterward under a show of love 
thou come to soothe thy lease to the king 
mean by that to make i to conceive 
that thy intent be just and honourable 
but see at last thou have deceive thyself 
and Edgar have find out thy subtlety 
which be requite think Edgar be thy enemy 
and vow to be revenge for this ill 
go to thy husband beauteous Alfrida 
for Edgar can subdue affect in love 

thank gracious king mirror of courtesy 
who virtuous thought bewray thy princely mind 
and make thou famous among thy enemy 
for what be he that hear of Edgar name 
and will not yield he praise as he deserve 
nor have your grace ever be praise more 
or term more just in any action 
than you shall be in conquer your desire 
and yield pardon to earl Ethenwald

my gracious lord I humble take my leave 

how be I wrong and yet without redress 

have patience good my lord and call to mind 
how you have live praise for virtuous government 
you have subdue lust unto this day 
and be repute wise in government 
and will you blemish all your honour get 
In be term a foul adulterer 

Dunston forbear for I will have it so 
it boot thou not to counsel i in this 
for I have swear the death of Ethenwald 
and he shall die or Edgar will not live 
Dunston it be enough I be resolve 

nay if it be so than Ethenwald shall not die 
and since entreaty can not serve the turn 
I will make make proof for once what art will do 

what will thou 

tell i what mean the king 

I will not tell thou 

I charge thou by the eternal live God 
that keep the prince of darkness bind in chain 
and by that sun that thou will glad see 
by heaven and earth and every live thing 
tell i that which I do demand of thou 

then thus the king do mean to murder Ethenwald 

but where be the king 

seek for Ethenwald 

but I will prevent he follow i invisible 

I will 

I have be this morning with a friend of i 
that will borrow a small sum of money of i 
but I have learn the best assurance a man can have 
in such a matter be a good pawn of twice the value 
or bond sufficient for five time the quantity 
he be my near kinsman I confess and a clergy man 
but fifty shilling be money and though I think I may trust he simple with it for a twelvemonth where he crave it but for a month yet simple I will not be so simple 
for I will borrow his gelding to ride to the term 
and keep away a just fortnight 
if then he pay i my money I will deliver he his horse 
I will be loath to lose my money or crave assurance of my kinsman 
but this may be do to try i and I mean likewise to try he 
this be plain though true brethren something subtle 
but here come one will fain take my house of i 

sir I be a poor man and I will give you thirty shilling a year if I may have it you shall be sure of your money 

true brother in Christ I can afford it of the price 
I must let my house to live I ask no gain but who come here 

I beseech you good master for God sake give one penny to the poor lame and blind good master give something 

fie upon thou lazy fellow be thou not ashamed to beg Read the bless say of S Paul which be thou shall get thy live with the sweat of thy brow and he that will not labour be not worthy to eat 

ay but he remember not where Christ say he that give a cup of cold water in my name shall be bless 

Alas sir you see I be old 

but that be no reason you shall beg 

Alas sir age come on i and my sight be go I hope sir you will pardon i though I beg and therefore for god sake one penny good master 

why I cel thou not for the spirit do not move i thereunto and in good time look in the bless proverb of Salomon which be good deed do not justify a man therefore I count it sin to give thou any thing 

see how he can turn and wind the scripture to his own use but he remember not where Christ say 
he that give to the poor dare unto the lord 
and he shall be repay seven fold but the priest forget that or at least wise he will not remember it 

now fie upon thou be this the pureness of your religion 
God will reward you no doubt for your hard deal 

care not thou for that well neighbour if thou will have my house friend and brother in Christ it will cost you forty shilling it be well worth it true provide this I may not stay for my rent I may have a great deal more but I be loath to exact on my brother 

and yet he will sell all a poor man have to his shirt for one quarter rend 

God blessing on your heart sir you make a godly exhortation a Sunday 

I brother the spirit do move i thereunto fie upon usury when a man will cut his brother throat for a little lucre fie upon it fie we be bear one to live by another and for a man to let his own as he may line it be allow by the word of God but for usury and oppression fie on it it be ungodly but tell i will you have it 

I will give you as I have proffer you 

true I can afford it I will I can but I must go to our exercise of prayer and after I must go see a farm that I shall have 

most gracious prince vouchsafe to hear i speak 
in that the law of kindred prick i on 
and though I speak contrary to your mind 
yet do I build on hope you will pardon i 
be I as eloquent as Demosthenes 
or like Isocrates be give to oratory 
your grace no doubt will think the time well spend 
and I shall gain i commendation 
but for my note be tune contrary 
I must entreat your grace to pardon i if I do jar in my delivery 

why Dunston thou have find we gracious still 
nor will we pull our settle love from thou 
until we find thy deal contrary 
but if thy parley be for Ethenwald 
that base dissembler with his sovereign 
it be better leave to speak in his excuse 
than by excuse he game our ill will 
for I be mind like the salamander stone 
that fire with anger will not in haste be quench 
though wax be soft and apt to receive any impression 
yet will hard mettle take no form except you melt the same 
so mean man mind may move as they think good 
but king just doom be irrevocable 

it be not enough where lust do move the offence 

why counsellor may not with king dispense 

a counsellor may speak if he see his prince offend 

and for his counsel rue it in the end 
but Dunston leave you urge we over far 
we pardon what be past but speak no more 

May pardon i for I will speak my mind 
your grace may call to mind proud Marius fall 
that through his wilful mind lose life and empire 
and Nimrod that build huge Babylon 
and think to make a tower to check the cloud 
be soon dismay by unknown language 
for no one know what any other speak 
which make he to confess though it be too late 
he have make offence in tempt of the lord 
Remember David Salomon and the rest 
nor have proud Holofernes lose his head 
have he not be a foul adulterer 

Dunston forbear and let this answer thou 
thou be too presumptuous in reprove i 
for I have swear as true as I live 
that I will never pardon Ethenwald 

do you but see the man I be assure 
you will not choose but pardon Ethenwald 

why Dunston you have see as well as I 
that Ethenwald have dissemble with the king 
my gracious lord first cut that traitor down 
and then will other fear the like amiss 

I tell thou Perin be the earl in place 
thou will eat these word utter in his disgrace 
veni Asmoroth and in good time see where he come 

but tell i Dunston be this Alfrida 

it be my gracious lord and this be Ethenwald 
that lay his breast wide open to your grace 
if so it please your grace to pardon he 

yes Dunston I be well content to pardon he 
Ethenwald stand up and rise up Alfrida 
for Edgar now give pardon to you both 

Asmoroth away my gracious lord Dunston will not forget 
this unknown favour show earl Ethenwald 
for which account my nephew and myself 
do yield both life and good at your dispose 

thank Dunston for thy honourable love 
and thou deserve to be a counsellor 
for he deserve not other to command 
that have no power to master his desire 
for Locrine be the elder son of Brute 
do dote so far upon a almain maid 
and be so ravish with her please sight 
that full seven year he keep she under earth 
even in the life time of fair Gwendolyn 
which make the cornish man to rise in arm 
and never leave till Locrine be slay 
and now though late at last I call to mind 
what wretched end fall to adulterer 

and if your grace call Abraham tale to mind 
when that egyptian Pharo crave his wife 
you will no doubt forgive my nephew guilt 
who by the merry jest he show your grace 
do save your honour and her chastity 

we take it so and for amends 
Ethenwald give i thy hand and we be friend 
and love thy wife and live together long 
for Edgar have forget all former wrong 

thank gracious king and here upon my knee 
I rest to be dispose as you please 

enough Ethenwald but who come here 

why I think I have take in hand a endless task 
to smell a knave it be more than a dog can do 
I have disguise myself of purpose to find 
a couple of knave which be yet behind 
the next knave be a priest call john the precise 
that with counterfeit holiness blind the people eye 
this be one of they that will say it be a shame 
for man to swear and blaspheme god holy name 
yet if he make a good sermon but once in a year 
he will be forty time in a tavern make good cheer 
yet in the church he will read with such sobriety 
that you will think he very precise and of great honesty 

what honesty have thou dispatch and find these privy knave 

I shall do anon I have they in send but I will be go 

good lord I praise God I be come from our morning exercise 
where I have profit myself and eify my brethren 
in show the way to salvation by my doctrine 
and now I be go to the court to prefer my petition 
I will give a hundred pound it be grant 
it be a thing of nothing but here come one of the court 
God save you brother in Christ be you towards the king 

I marry be I what then why do thou ask 

Nothing sir but I will desire you to stand my friend 
to get i the king hand and seal to this letter 
I will not use it sir to hinder any man for a thousand pound 
for indeed I be a clergy man by my profession 
it be nothing sir but as you see to have the king seal 
t carry tin lead wool and broad clothes beyond sea 
for you know sir every man will make the most he can of his own 
and for my part I use it but for a present necessity 
if you will undertake to do it I will give you a hundred pound 

I thank you sir but I be afraid the king will 
hardly grant it why it be a undo to the common wealth 
but true I will move the king to hang you priest i'faith 
may it please you grace to grant i my petition 
for I offer it your grace in pure devotion 

o monstrous Dunston do thou ever hear the like 
now fie upon thou base villain lay hand on he 

on i nay on he priest I give your petition to the king 
and I will speak to he you may be but hang 
for if you shall live till the king grant your petition 
the very raven will pick out thy eye live 
and therefore it be better you be hang to save the bird a labour 

now honesty have thou do be here all 

o no my lord for there be so many behind 
that I be afraid my work will never have a end 
but I see by the priest look he lack company 
stay a while my lord I will fetch another present 

fie graceless man have thou no fear of God 
to withhold thou from these lawless motion 
why thou shall be as messenger of God 
and hate deceit and wicked avarice 
but thou be one of those who God do hate 
and thy vild deed will witness against thy soul 
and make the most abominable in his sight 
that make thou wretch but to a better end 
then thus to wrong his sacred deity 
now fie upon thou monster of a man 
that for to gain thyself a private gain 
will seek the undo of a common wealth 
and though thou bid ten thousand torment here 
they can quit thou where thou shall appear 

a prize though it be long I have find he at last 
but I can not bring he with i 
and therefore I pin a paper on his shoulder 
mean thereby to mark he for the gailous 
but hush here he come 

what Perin I can think that Perin will be false to i 

why not for he be false to himself look in his pocket and see 
this be but a false writ that he have use 
unknown to your majesty and levy great sum of money 
and bribe upon your poor commons extreme 
how say you my lord be this true or no 

honesty thou say true why impious wretch 
ingrateful wretch that thou be to injure he that always hold thou dear 
believe i Dunston I dare well have swear 
that Perin have not hatch so base a thought 

ay but your grace see you be deceive 
but will your grace grant i one boon 

what be that honesty 

that I may have the punish of they 
who I have so labour to find 

with all my heart honesty use they as thou will 

I thank your grace go fetch the other two 
now to you Cuthbert cutpurse the coneycatcher 
thy judgement be to stand at the market cross 
and have thy curse tongue pin to thy breast 
and there to stand for man to wonder at 
till owl and nightraven pick out thy curse eye 

good honesty be more merciful 

you know my mind oh Walter that will have more 
and you shall have judgement I mean which be 
to be carry into a corn field and there have your leg and hand cut off because you love corn so well and there rest till the crow thereunto pick out thy eye 
but now to you that will do nothing except the spirit move you 
you shall for abuse the bless word of God 
and mock the divine order of ministry 
whereby you have lead the ignorant into error 
you I say as you be shameless in your shameful deal 
shall to your shame and the utter shame of all bad mind man 
that live as thou have do 
stand in Finsbury field near London 
and there as a dissemble hypocrite be shoot to death 

good honesty be more favourable than so 

true no the spirit do not move i thereunto 
but who be next what Perin a courtier and a cozener to 
I have a judgement yet in store for thou 
and for because I will use thou favourable 
i'faith thy judgement be to be but hang 
but where even at Tyburn in a good twopenny halter 
and though you can never abide the sea 
yet now against your will you must bear your sail namely your sheer 
and in a cart be tow up Holborn hill 
will all man live like these in this land 
may be judge so at honesty hand 

well honesty come follow we to court 
where thou shall be reward for thy pain 

I thank your grace you that will damn yourselves for lucre sake 
and make no conscience to deceive the poor 
you that be enemy of the common wealth 
to send corn over to enrich the enemy 
and you that do abuse the word of God 
and send over wool and tin broad cloth and lead 
and you that counterfeit king privy seal 
and thereby rob the willing mind commonalty 
I warn you all that use such subtle villainy 
beware lest you like these be find by honesty 
take heed I say for if I catch you once 
your body shall be meat for crow 
and the devil shall have your bone 
and thus though long at last we make a end 
desire you to pardon what be amiss 
and way the work though it be grossy pen 
laugh at the fault and weigh it as it be 
and honesty will pray upon his knee 
God cut then off that wrong the prince or commonalty 
and may her day of bliss never have end 
upon who life so many life depend
