alas poor shepherd 

it shall afford no shade to any thing 
that hither use to come for its relief 
but henceforth be for ever infamous 
that when some gentle shepherd pass by 
and see this ground rend with the crooked plough 
here he may say here it be that Sylvia 
be lose and then shall turn another way 

good Thyrsis do not make so much of grief 
you have feed it with too many tear already 
take comfort now 

what have my present state 
to do with comfort if you see the tree 
widow of leaf the earth grow hard and spoil 
of the green mantle which she wont to wear 
you wonder not if winter then appear 

by these we know that season 

and must I 
when she be go who sunlike eye do cherish 
a everlasting summer in my life 
feel any spring of joy to comfort i 
no father grief with i be best in season 

but while you mourn thus who look to your flock 

all as the shepherd be such be his flock 
so pine and languish they as in despair 
he pine and languish their fleecy lock 
let hang disorder as their master hair 
since she be go that deck both he and they 
and now what beauty can there be to live 
when she be lose that do all beauty give 

but yet methinks for one that be a stranger 
scarce know to any here but by her name 
these plaint be overmuch beside there be 
in fruitful arcady as fair as she 
I be sure more rich and wise make out of they 
a choice Nerina be as fair as she 
Dorinda flock be more than Silvia 
and carry on their back more wool than she 

let such base peasant as the god do hate 
admire their wealth and they for what they have 
their body and their soul material 
alike of drossy substance be compound 
and can contemplate nothing but the earth 
no Silvia who some better God perhaps 
for the reward of my well tune pipe 
send down to i make up of air and fire 
though since because I know not how to use 
with fair respect a gift so great as she 
have just reave she from i be so much 
so great a part of i that in her absence 
amid my grief I feel some little joy 
to see how much of i each minute waste 
and give i hope that when I shall dissolve 
this earthly substance and be pure as she 
for sure the god have take her undefiled 
I may enjoy her look and though it be 
profane to touch a hallow thing like she 
I may adore she yet and recompense 
with my religion the proud thought I have 
once to enjoy she 

see how fond you be 
to embrace a shadow and to leave the substance 
the love of Hylas to Nerina have 
more hope than you though she be young and coy 
yet while Nerina be and Hylas too 
one time or other they may both have joy 

may they prove happy in each other love 
and nothing please but what each other do 
for so live Thirsis and his Silvia 
while Silvia be and Thirsis be her love 
whatever Thirsis pipe please Silvia 
Thirsis admire whatever Sylvia sing 
and both their joy be equal or but one 
well I can now remember and it be 
some comfort to remember what I moan 
that when our love begin how first I gaze 
on she and she be please that I shall look 
till greedy I have devour the hook 
love give i courage then to speak my thought 
and give her pity to receive my word 
they link our heart together from that time 
when ere she see i strike the furious boar 
though then my case she rue and sigh full oft 
yet be she please to see my victory 
and I receive my vigour from her eye 
then will she make i chaplet of the best 
and choice flower to adorn my head 
which when I wear methinks I then do grasp 
the empire of the world but what of that 
the more I then enjoy of heavenly bliss 
the more my present grief and passion be 

well Thyrsis since my word do but renew 
the story of your grief I will leave to use 
persuasion to you for it be time I see 
and not my word must cure your malady 

that time must put a period to my life 
or else it never will unto my grief 
come boy and under this same hang bow 
the note which thou attemper to my word 
sing and be happy than thy master boy 

shall I because my love be go 
accuse those golden dart 
which to a bless union 
strike our two love heart 
since fortune and not love have cause my moan 
no her pure image I shall prize 
imprint in my breast 
more than the fair mistress eye 
that ever swain possess 
which in eternal bond my fancy tie 
Come then you sharp grief and try 
if you can pierce my heart 
but use if you will have i die 
the best you can of art 
to wound a breast so arm with constancy 

enough I will sigh the rest out go my boy 
be careful of thy tender lamb while I 
seek out some hide place to pine and die 

why who can say Mirtillus do not love 
Mirtillus he who have employ his youth 
ever in service of the fair nymph 

Mirtillus can love 

no gentle Hylas 
this ribbon and this hair you see i wear 
be they not ensign of a lover say 
what shepherdess who ever swain think fair 
have not Mirtillus court and obtain 
some favour from but you will think because 
I do not fold my arm and sigh and spend 
the day the god have give i to rejoice 
in whine passion walk still alone 
now proud with hope then cast down with despair 
unequal to myself in every thing 
I can love no Hylas know I love 
Dorinda Cloris Amarillis all 
who ever love do to his altar call 
and when this mistress frown I be content 
to take another when that flame be spend 
by time or put out by a rival straight 
a three supply her place perhaps more worthy 
if less because she love I will think she so 

Alas Mirtillus I do pity thou 
pity the error which thou wander in 
that think thou love and know not what it be 

why what be love say you if i be not 

I know Mirtillus that no lover yet 
purchase a last pleasure without grief 
for love have gall in it as well as honey 
and so compound that whosoever will taste 
the sweet of it must take the bitter too 
out of both which be make our constancy 
you that embrace the false delight alone 
be a feign lover or more true none 

I know not what you mean by constancy 
I be sure I love the fair 

still you err 
for if you love the fair none have be 
the object of your choice but my Nerina 
Nerina she the glory of these wood 
the only subject of all shepherd song 

she have her share of beauty with the rest 
and I confess she be fit for love as any 
but why she only shall take up your breast 
and shut out all that have a right as good 
who equal or transcendent beauty plead 
as just a title to it as she can do 
I can reach the reason but admire 
your faith and what you praise your constancy 

Mirtillus though I know your stubborn heart 
can never entertain a lover think 
yet do I think you will have be more tender 
how you profane a name so sacred as 
nerina be who never any swain 
nor rural God nor satyr though he be 
of savage kind will ever violate 
Nerina in who form love ever dwell 
attend by the grace which do range 
themselves in order about her comely face 
who breast without be hill of white snow 
within the seat of blameless modesty 
regard of honour and pure chastity 
nor may a loose thought ever harbour there 
to tempt such lover as you seem to be 
be it for that you slight she 

no I love she 
as I do other with who I compare she 
but you that love with such intemperance 
make of your love a glass wherein you see 
each thing much great than indeed it be 
my love too cold you say but I be sure 
you be too hot for any to endure 
a mean perhaps betwixt these I may approve 

you may if there be any mean in love 

but while we talk thus see the flame have catch you 
your beauteous flame Nerina be at hand 
Dorinda with she dare you stay the encounter 

no let we with draw and watch she where she go 

the god do love you sure that have leave 
your thought so free for sport i be not so 

thou be in love I warrant be thou not 

that angry God pursue i in his fury 
and force i to love where I be scorn 
hapless Dorinda why shall he despise thou 
many a swain and many a rural God 
have seek thy favor and have seek in vain 
now thou be just punish with disdain 

trust i sweetheart I can choose but wonder 
to think that one of such a comely grace 
I do not flatter you can sue to any 
for love who be much fit to be love 
scorn he as much as he do thou for man 
love we no more when we love they again 

ah good Nerina you have speak truth 
it may warn other nymph by my example 
how they profess their love to any man 
I be past the cure he that wound i 
have leave i quite disarm and rob i of 
all those defensive art which man will say 
be natural and proper to our sex 
I can change a face or weep one tear 
or laugh against my will so violent 
my fate have thrust i to this love that all 
my faculty confess their weakness and 
my flame be get so much above my reach 
I can not put it out nor smother it 

alas poor wench tell i who be the man 
make up of so much rigid cruelty 
that I may shun he wheresoever I go 

do not you know he 

no 

I hear he boast 
to every shepherd and to every nymph 
how much I love he 

then it must be Daphnis 

Venus forgive i if I do disclose he 
but he will do it himself it be he Nerina 

Daphnis that woe my father to win i 
he be my daily suitor now I know 
how much he owe to pity and to thou 
until he pay that debt I shall despise he 

why do not you love he as much as I 

love he I know no great misery 
then to love one that be not of humane race 
a tiger rather but a tiger be 
more mild than he 

for love sake say not so 
he have a manly feature and do show 
as much of grace in his comportment as 
the best of shepherd can he Titan make 
of better clay than he do other man 
although his heart be flint and hard rock 
yet be his heart so hard or be my part 
rather unequal to his high desert 
for he can love I see since you he love 
and you deserve it have he think i worthy 
he will have love i too but as I be 
worthless Dorinda I be make his scorn 
and I have rather be so than Nerina 
shall want a servant such as Daphnis be 

prithee no more of he I hate his name 
as much as I will do the loss of honour 
which he injurious will rob i off 
no no Dorinda if by love I be 
enthrall to any Daphnis be not he 

why be there any can deserve you more 

yes many that I can tell how to love 
rather than he for why shall I love he 
while Hylas live and languish for i 
Hylas who love i in my infancy 
and be then a boy be never well 
if I be absent nor indeed be I 
content with any but his company 
our flock still feed together I on he 
and he on i do feed his greedy eye 
since though his year have style he man he have 
continue that first love with such respect 
so full of innocence and simple truth 
that howsoever my outward coyness be 
my heart within tell i it be only his 
ay i my father prithee let we away 

but Daphnis come with he for love sake stay 

go leave your curse 
and follow she let i alone with he 

ha have I find you hoh Nerina stay 
your father call you be not that my daughter 
that make away so fast 

who she that be go 
believe your eye no more they be false to you 
can you take one for she that be nothing like she 
it be Cloris go from we 

be it possible 

it be true 

I think that it have be my love 

I dare have swear that she have be my daughter 
what make she here it will never be otherwise 
young woman will be chat with young man 
whatever their father say it be not so 
when I be young a boy as you be shepherd 

we be not man with he till after fifty 

we never dare keep company with woman 
nor they with we each one do careful 
attend his charge and when the time be come 
that we grow ripe in year and be stay youth 
our father will provide we wife we do not 
carve for ourselves as now a day they do 
but now our child think themselves as wise 
nay wise than their father and will rule they 
they can no soon peep out of the shell 
but they must love forsooth I will fain know 
whether it be fit a maid shall be in love 
I speak now of that skittish girl my daughter 
before she ask her father leave and like 

it be true Charinus it be not fit indeed 
who shall bestow the daughter but the father 

but shepherd do you never hear that once 
there be a age the near to the god 
a age we rather praise than imitate 
when no man will nor woman be enforce 
to any bent but its own motion 
each follow nature law and by instinct 
do love the fair and enjoy their wish 
love than not tie to any interest 
of blood or fortune hasten to his end 
without control nor do the shepherd number 
her sheep that be his choice but every grace 
that do adorn her beauteous mind or face 
riches with love then be not value 
pure uncompounded love that can despise 
the whole world riches for a mistress eye 
pray tell i Daphnis you be young and handsome 
the lover of our fair nymph Nerina 
will you for all that fruitful Sicily 
can yield or all the wealth of Persia 
change one poor lock of your fair mistress hair 
while she be you and you her shepherd be 

will she be i I will ask no portion 

speak like a lover of the ancient stamp 

son son she shall be you why be not I 
her father she my daughter may not I 
bestow she where I please 

yes if she like 
the man she will bestow herself never fear it 

what she bestow herself without my leave 
no no Mirtillus you mistake my daughter 
I can get she once to think of marriage 
and true I do muse to see a wench 
that in all other thing although I say it 
have wit at will can pin her sheep in fold 
as well as any know when to drive they home 
and there she can do twenty thing as well 
yet when I speak to she of marriage 
she turn the head she will be a dryad she 
or one of those fond nymph of Diane train 

old man believe she not she mean not so 
she love to keep the thing for which she be 
so much belove I mean her maidenhead 
which while she have she know to play the tyrant 
and make we slave unto her scornful look 
for beauty then itself most justify 
when it be court if not love it die 

well we will think of this come Daphnis come 
I see you love my daughter and you only 
shall have she it be I that tell you so 
that be her father 

thank you good Charinus 
but I have rather she have tell i so 

and why not you aswell by their example 

not in this life here joy will be untimely 
the god reserve for i their comfort in 
the elyzian field or else they mock my sorrow 

o say not so they be just and pitiful 

they be but father so I still must call you 
when in the sadness of my soul I ask 
before the altar of our great Apollo 
what shall become of i or where my love 
bright Silvia be whether alive or dead 
why shall the oracle reply go home 
thou shall enjoy thy Silvia 

what more can you 
desire to hear 

ay but when greedy 
I ask the time the answer be that day 
thou be not Thirsis nor she Silvia 
then in this life I be sure it must not be 
for I be Thyrsis ever call and she 
know by no other name then Sylvia 

it may be for your importunity 
you may deserve this answer or else be it 
because the god speak not their mystery 
to be conceive by every vulgar sense 
I now remember what Acrisius 
the wise and virtuous Acrisius 
be wont to say 

why what say he 
do it concern i aught 

it may do son 
he bid we fly all curiosity 
seek to know what future time may bring 
to we which only god above do know 
and if at any time they do impart 
this knowledge unto we it be enwrap 
in such a mist as we shall never see through it 
because say he we have enough to do 
with what be present the celestial power 
will not cut of our hope nor multiply 
our care by show we our destiny 

o this discourse to a despair lover 
what comfort do it bring for heaven sake leave it 
and i for I be best I find alone 
yet stay there be something that I fain will ask you 
you say this circle here about my neck 
have so continue from my infancy 
when first you take i up 

it be true that circle 
hang loose then about your neck which since 
be fill with it I leave it there because 
I see some letter that be wrought about it 

and may they not be read 

I think they may 
but I can never find so great a clerk 
as can tell how to expound the meaning of they 

my life be nothing but a mystery 
that which I be and that which I shall be 
be equal unknown now if you will leave i 
unto my thought they will keep i company 

I will but here be one come to supply i 

ay let i alone 
he that mourn for a mistress 
when he know not where she be 
let he kiss her shadow fair 
or engender with the air 
or see if with his tear he can 
swell at a ebb the ocean 
then if he have not rather die 
let he love none or all as I 
this be the doctrine that I ever teach you 
and yet you profit not these scurvy passion 
hang on you still you that be young and active 
that may have all our nymph at your devotion 
to live a whine kind of life as this 
how ill it do become you 

true Mirtillus 
and yet I do not envy thou the pleasure 
thou have in thy disperse affection 

you will if your head be right once but love 
your love do make a ass of all your reason 

sure a true lover be more rational 
than you that love at random everywhere 

I do not think so all the reason love 
have leave you to employ in this discourse 
will hardly bring i to confess it to you 

why all man action have some proper end 
whereto their mean and strict endeavour tend 
else there will be nought but perplexity 
in humane life and all uncertainty 

well what will you infer on this 

that you 
who know no end at all of wild desire 
must in your wander fancy see this way 
lead unto madness when too late you find 
that nothing satisfy a boundless mind 

ay but I do confine myself to two 
or three at most in this variety 
I please myself for what be want in 
one I may find it in another 

no 
not in another one be the only centre 
the line of love be draw to must have all 
perfection in she all that be good and fair 
or else her lover must believe she so 

ay there be your error that be the ground of all 
your tear and sigh your fruitless hope and fear 
when she perhaps have not so much to adorn she 
as the least grace your thought bestow upon she 

well be it so and yet this fair idea 
which I have frame unto myself do argue 
virtue in i so that if she be lose 
or dead ay i the sad remembrance of 
my Sylvia cause this yet I must love 
because the character be indelible 
write in my heart and heaven be witness to it 

well I will no more of this I will be convert 
rather than call this grief to your remembrance 

why do thou think I ever shall forget she 
or that where ere I set my careful foot 
as in this place will it not tell i that 
here Sylvia and I walk hand in hand 
and here she pluck a flower and anon 
she give it i and than we kiss and here 
we mutual do vow each other love 

nay leave good Thyrsis I do come to tell you 
this holiday our royal prince Euarchus 
be remove to his house here near adjoin 
send to command we to attend his person 
with all our sport and wont merriment 
wherein you always bear the chief part 
and I have hear it be not to make you blush 
the princess have commend your rare art 
and handsome grace which you give your music 
Come you must go with we for Hylas be 
so far engage in love and near his hope 
he will not stir unless his mistress go 

Alas Mirtillus I have break my pipe 
my sigh be all the music which I now 
can make and how unfit I be to attend 
so great a expectation you may see 
yet give i leave to think on it at night 
perhaps I will go with you 

till then farewell 
the gentle youth that ever play on pipe 
but see who be here o it be my other lover 
his mistress with he I will not disturb he 

how can I sweet when my heart be with you 

with i then tell i where and see how soon 
I shall restore it you aside 

o this be fine 

it hang upon your eye where be scorch 
with their disdain and dazzle with their lustre 
it fly for ease unto your rosy lip 
but beat thence with many a harsh denial 
fain will it come for better harbour here 
but here for ever it must be a exile 
for pity then fair nymph receive it you 
and if you can teach it the hardness of 
your own and make it marble as you be 

I see he be not such a novice as aside 
I take he for he can tell how to speak 

well if my heart be such as you will make it 
I be so much the glad that it be 
of strength to be a fence unto my honour 

in vain a fence be make to guard the sheep 
where no wolf ever come 

what if within 
it keep a dog of prey will they be safe 
for my part I will not cherish in my breast 
the man that will undo my chastity 

then cherish i for you best know I never 
attempt any thing to cast a spot 
on that white innocence to which I be 
a most religious votary 

more fool you aside 
it may be if you have it need not 
have come to this 

yes yes you may remember 
I blush to tell it you when first my thought 
be pure and simple as I hope they be 
still and will so continue while I fly 
such company as you I think you one 
who never any flame impure have touch 
then we converse without suspect together 

and be I not so still why do you now 
fly from i thus 

the cause I shall tell you 
since you will not remember though it be 
unfit for i to speak yet you shall know 
how just my anger be 

ay i most wretched 
what have I do 

when tend of my flock 
under the shade of yonder myrtle tree 
which bear the guilt of your soul misdemeanour 
my maid Corisca cry out for my help 
because a bee have sting she in the face 
you hear i speak in pity of her smart 
a charm my mother teach i that be say 
close to the place affect take away 
the pain which give her ease but you uncivil 
turn my courtesy to your vile end 
feign you be sting too and cry out your lip 
have from the same sharp point receive a wound 
pray i to say the same charm over there 
I charitable lend my help to you 
mistrust nothing of your purpose 
when with ungentle hand you hold i fast 
and for my thank give i a lustful kiss 
can thou remember this and yet not blush 
o impudence 

you will excuse the heat 
of my desire still I feel that sting 
but dare not ask the cure nor do I then 
do any hurt but since you think it be 
a fault I do repent it and be sorry 
I do offend you so 

better and better 
he will cry anon he have already ask 
forgiveness of she aside 

well shepherd look 
you never see i more I can love 
at all or if at all not you let this 
settle your thought 

o it distract they more 
but since my presence be offensive to you 
I must obey yet if I think you will 
when I be dead the martyr of your beauty 
shed one poor tear on my untimely grave 
and say that Hylas be unfortunate 
to love where he may not be love again 
my ash will find rest and so farewell 
the fair but the cruel nymph alive 

what will you leave she thus 

I prithee come 
the sentence of my banishment be past 
never to be recall 

be these the hope 
you feed upon o what a thing in nature 
be a coy woman or how great a fool 
the man be that will give her leave to rule 

be she not so Charinus 
do she say any thing that be out of reason 

do not tell i of reason I will hear 
of her obedience therefore I say be wise 
and do as I will have you 

what will you 
have she to do you see she answer not 
to contradict you 

I will have her answer 
to what I now demand that be to marry 
Daphnis and I will have she love he too 

love he Charinus that you can do 
her body you may link in the right of Hymen 
her will she must bestow herself not you 

o she be bear to be a plague unto i aside 

why shall she wish or hope for any thing 
but what I will have she wish or hope for only 
Come to be short answer i and direct 
be you content to marry Daphnis say 

what be your pleasure father 

you do not hear 
it seem but what you list I ask you once 
again if you will marry Daphnis speak

I know you shall do that which I command 

now heaven forbid that I who have thus long 
vow to Diana my virginity 
to follow she a huntress in these wood

of Hymen and so violate my faith

a vow and never ask your father leave 
the law will not permit it to be so 

the vow Charinus be not make to man 
the law have not to do with that which be 
seal and record in the court of heaven

while you be young you will have all the youth 
to follow you with lie and flattery 
fool they will deceive you when this colour fade 
which will not always last and you go crooked 
as if you seek your beauty lose in the ground 
then they will laugh at you and find some other 
fit for their love where if you do as I 
command you I have one will make you happy

or want of health 
A it be the order of the fate 
that these shall wait on high state 
Cho love only do our soul refine 
and by his skill 
turn humane thing into divine 
and guide our will 
then let we of his praise sing 
of love that sweeten every thing 

madam you be overhear 

I care not Delia 
although my liberty and free discourse 
be here deny i yet the air be common 
to it then will I utter my complaint 
or to thou friend to who my love will dare 
to show the secret of my heart for other 
I do not care nor fear so thou be faithful 

madam I have no life but what I wish 
may be employ to do your beauty service 
my tongue be rule by you what you will have 
it speak it shall else further than my thought 
nothing shall venture that you leave to i 
and those my thought I will keep to such restraint 
as they shall never come within my dream 
lest they betray your counsel this I vow 
religious by 

hold I will not 
have thou to swear nor will I thou shall think 
that I so much suspect thou as to urge 
a oath I know thou have too much of goodness 
that be breed within thou to betray a trust 
and therefore without further circumstance 
I will let thou know my fortune part of which 
I be sure the haste hear already 

madam I have 
and wish that they have sort to your wish 

I thank thou Delia but my evil genius 
that have pursue my innocence with hate 
bring i from thence where I have set my heart 
unto this curse court which though it be 
my place of birth and breed I do find 
nothing but torment and affliction in it 

I guess the cause sweet madam but that be past 
and now forget if you clear your look 
your father will enlarge you and never think 
on what you do but that you be his daughter 

alas my Delia thou do mistake 
my liberty be of no worth to i 
since that my love I fear will never be free 
nor do I care what idle lady talk 
of my departure or my strange disguise 
to colour my intent I be above 
their envy or their malice 
but for the unlucky chance that send to i 
the overcurious eye of he I hate 
thou know the man 

yes you mean Cleander 
son to Eubulus who be now your keeper 
what star direct he to find you out 

his love forsooth for so he colour his 
unseasoned boldness tell i he be not able 
to want my sight and so when every one 
have give over their strict enquiry of i 
he only with too much officiousness 
observe i in the wood walk alone 
and when I will have shun he which perhaps 
have I not do he have not so well know i 
he come and utter as his manner be 
his tedious complaint until at length 
he bring i with he make no resistance 
and to ingratiate himself the more 
he say he will convey i where my father 
shall have no knowledge of i I refuse it 
willing however to be rid of he 
and now you know it be a full month since 
I do return to court but leave my heart 
behind i in those field wherein I joy 

madam have not the court more pleasure in it 
than the dull country which can represent 
nothing but what do taste of solitude 
it be something else that carry you away 

it be true my Delia for though thou be 
privy to my departure yet the cause 
thou can not tell which I will now unfold 
and think I trust my honour in thy hand 
and maiden modesty it be love that do it 

love madam sure it be impossible 
you shall find any thing there worth your love 

thou know the shepherd that do dwell about 
this place which for their entertainment only 
the king my father build do use to come 
as now they do be send for unto court 
I ever like their sport their harmless mirth 
and their contention which be void of malice 
and wish I have be bear just such a one 

your state be better madam as you be 

but I confess the rather cause there be 
one among they of a more comely grace 
though none of they do seem uncomely to i 
call Thyrsis and with he methinks I can 
draw out my life rather than any other 
such thing my fancy then suggest to i 
so well he sing so passionate his love 
show in his verse thereto so well express 
as any one will judge it natural 
yet never feel he flame till this of i 
often he come and often be desire 
of i nor do I shame in public there 
before my father to commend his grace 
which when I do the whole court as they use 
consent with i and do strive to make they 
great than I or any else can think they 
at last I be surprise I can not help it 
my fate with love consent so will have it 
then do I leave the court I have tell thou all 

it be strange but madam though in that disguise 
how can you hope a stranger to be love 
of he you hold so dear 

I feign myself 
of Smyrna and from thence some goat I have 
and sheep with they a rich commodity 
near he I buy i land to feed they he 
seem glad of it and think i a stranger 
use i with such civility and friendship 
as one will little look for of a shepherd 
and do defend i from the avarice 
of the old shepherd which do think to make 
a prey of what I have at length I see 
he do address himself with fear to i 
still gaze on i know my love to he 
I easy believe he love i too 
for love alas be ever credulous 
and though I be resolve have my end 
which be no more than to discourse with he 
never to let he know what flame I feel 
yet when I see his tear and hear his vow 
persuasive speaker for affection 
I can not choose but open to his view 
my love heart yet with this caution 
that he shall ever bear respect unto 
my honour and my virgin chastity 
which than he vow and his ambition 
never be more than to attain a kiss 
which yet he hardly get thou see sweet Delia 
how willing I dwell upon this theme 
but can thou help i now that I have open 
my wound unto thou 

Alas I will I can 
invent the way to cure you I shall soon 
apply my help yet stay this day it be 
the shepherd come to court 

it be true they come 
but what be that to i if Thyrsis come not 
or if he come how shall he know i he 
or I enjoy his company 

let i alone 
to work out that 

thou dream thou can not do it 

I will undertake it but how shall I know he 
without inquire which must breed suspicion 

true and beware thou ask the majesty 
which sit upon his brow will say it be he 
Thyrsis my love but yet perhaps at this time 
if I myself not flatter thou shall know he 
by his eye cast down and fold of his arm 
and often sigh that interrupt his word 
for if his sorrow wear the livery 
which mine do for his absence by these sign 
thou shall descry he 

these be silent mark 
yet will I not despair to find he out 

but when thou have what will thou say to he 

give i but leave to use my mother wit 
you will be go together will you not 

thou speak my thought do this and I will crown 
thy faith thou shall be queen instead of i 

if you can crown i with your virtue madam 
I shall be a queen indeed in the mean time 
as I be Delia I will do this business 

do it and when the have do the god of love 
reward thou with thy own desire for this 

madam withdraw I hear your keeper come 

it be well Cleander 
it will behoove you then to be reserve 
and lock this secret up for it be no jest 
with king that may command our life and fortune 
you now perceive she who we call the princess 
to be your sister and the love you bear she 
must be a brother friendship not a lover 
passionate heat but yet she must not know 
that I her father be and you her brother 
and trust i son have I not see despair 
of life in you which this love bring you too 
I shall not have reveal what now you know 

it be a comfort sir I do confess 
that come in time to rescue i from death 
so great her scorn be and my love so violent 

now you be at peace I hope 

I be but if 
I be too curious in ask where 
the king son be I shall desire your pardon 
for sure it be injustice to deprive 
so great a prince of that which he be bear too 

you be too far inquisitive yet because 
I have engage you in a secret of 
as great importance this I will not hide 
the king I tell you when his wife grow near 
the time of her delivery send to know 
of our great oracle whether the child shall be 
female or male and what shall be their fortune 

what say the oracle have you the answer 

it only be impart unto i 
and this it be which I have never show 
to any but the queen here take and read it 
if ere thy issue male thou live to see 
the child thou think be thou thou shall not be 
his life shall be obscure twice shall thy hate 
doom he to death yet shall he escape that fate 
and thou shall live to see that not long after 
thy only son shall wed thy only daughter 
this oracle be full of mystery 

it be and yet the king will needs interpret 
that shall it prove a manchild it be a bastard 
and be loath that one not of his blood 
as he conceive by this shall be his heir 
tell i in private that if it be male 
he will not have it live yet fear most 
to publish his dishonour and his wife 
he charge i not reveal it unto any 
but take the child and see it make away 
and make the world believe it be still bear 

and do you so 

no for indeed I dare not 
for any thing become a murderer 

how do you then 

I go unto the queen 
show she the state she be in and beseech she 
to be as careful of i as I be 
of she and we will work a better end 
than she expect so we both agree 
that if the child she then do labour with 
prove to be male I shall with care conceal 
the birth of it and put a female child 
instead of it which I be to look out 
it fortune that your mother then be ready 
to be deliver of your sister and 
time and good fortune do conspire to save 
the king child and to make my daughter princess 

but what do then become of the young prince 

the queen protest to i that it be 
the king own child conjure i to preserve it 
which as my own I can not for already 
many take notice that my child be female 
and therefore I be fain to publish she 
as dead and bury a empty coffin 
I ride forth with the child a full night journey 
with purpose to deliver it to some 
plain honest man that will be careful of it 
and not inquisitive to know who child 
it be but give it breed as his own 
when be fright with the noise of arm 
of some outlawed thief that do infest 
the place I make all haste I can to escape they 
consider my charge for that I know 
if I be take though they spare my life 
the charge I have must needs betray i to 
the king and then I can not hope for mercy 
I lay it down there cover close over 
a circle about his neck wherein be write 
in character know only to myself 
and to the king in which I use to clothe 
secret dispatch when I write to he 
from foreign state and within the circle 
I grave the king less seal which then I keep 
some gold beside and jewel there I leave 
that whosoever shall find he may with that 
defray the charge of his education 
however next day I purpose to return 
with speed and carry it to some abode 

but do the queen know this 

she do not 
till my return next day then when I tell she 
the child be thence remove where I have leave he 

belike those thief have carry he away 

it be probable 

how can the queen take this 
so sad a story 

with such impatience 
that be weak before she short die 

but yet sir with your favour may you not 
have make inquiry after he 

I dare not 
for fear of be discover on your life 
take heed how you reveal this 

I be charm 

then let we watch my daughter for I fear 
the flight she make be for some other end 
then for retirement which she do pretend 

henceforth I shall obey she as my princess 
and love she as my sister not my mistress 

you shall do well come let we to the king 

what paper be that 
loveverse as I live what be here a dream 
nay I will read they therefore stand aside 
sleep thou be calm of a trouble sprîte 
which lead my fancy to that sweet delight

bring hither to make good my own position 
against the company of pule lover 
which if I do not and with good effect

to one that be desperate no way be amiss 

all leave the room Eubulus I be resolve 
to hold a easy hand over my daughter 
then I be wont therefore I send Cleander 
to bring she to my presence though she have 
wrong her great birth and breed by her folly 
yet I consider that she be my daughter 
and this restraint can but harden she 
in her fond resolution have you seek 
by all the mean you can to sift the cause 
of her departure 

sir I have try 
by all the way that fit a subject to 
inquire a truth of one that be his princess 

and what have you discover 

nothing more 
than what my son Cleander do before 

I have hear his relation but I wonder 
how for a whole month time she shall abide 
within our confine when so great a search 
through all our country and loud proclamation 
be make for her recovery 

it be true 
she herein be ingenuous and confess 
that she foresee what search will be make for she 
therefore with some about she she have plot 
to hire a bark that may convey she hence 
in a disguise to Smyrna where she stay 
till time do fit she that with safety 
she may return in habit of a nymph 
unto the place where then Cleander find she 
but why she leave the court she will not tell 

I will not force she to it some little time 
perhaps may make discovery of that secret 
but unto thou my faithful counsellor 
as unto one my heart have still be open 
I will discover what my purpose be 
in send for these shepherd to my court 

I shall believe they resent for to delight 
your majesty as they be wont 

no Eubulus 
but for a great end I fear my daughter 
and therefore I have send for she to see 
these sport with purpose to observe her look 
for I suspect she love some shepherd there 

it can be she will not stain her birth 
with such ignoble love yet I confess 
revolve all the cause of her strange 
departure I can fix on none but that 

well if she do so I will let she forth 
forth of my blood and whosoever he be 
who fortune mark he out to be the object 
of this her love shall find Ixion fate 
he shall embrace a shadow by my life 
they both shall die 

o my gracious lord 
remember she be your daughter 

ay thou still 
do plead for she but yet be I her king 
as well as father private man respect 
their profit and their private interest 
of kindred but the action of a king 
to honour and renown must be direct Cleander enter 
Consider that and than thou will forget she 
Cleander welcome how do Calligone 
be she not glad to come unto our presence 
why do not answer be thou fright man 

I know not how to answer any thing 
unless your majesty will sign my pardon 

why what be the matter speak and speak it free 

then know great sovereign that when I go 
as full of joy as speed with your glad message 
I find the princess 

what not dead I hope 

dead to her honour 

ha 

in short my lord 
I find she walk in the garden with 
a shepherd more of he I can tell 
but she be habit in that attire 
she wear when from the wood I bring she home 
I slip away not be see by they 
and if you please to go perhaps great sir 
you still may find they there 

how now Eubulus 
be my presage true shall I then sleep 
with this disgrace and let my neighbour prince 
mock at my humble fortune when they hear 
the daughter of Euarchus match herself 
with a base shepherd go Eubulus quick 
here take my signet let this be your warrant 
to put they both to death 

how both my lord 

ay both 

your daughter too 

why do you question i 
have I not say they both shall die dispatch 
let i not see thou till they both be dead Exit 

what have thou do thou rash inhuman boy 
deprive thy father of a child thyself 
of thy own sister who but now thou know 
well may the king take that dear life away 
which he do never give I will go tell he 
I be her father but I lose my life 
if I do that as guilty of a treason 
go murderer have thou no pity in thou 

sir I do feel so much of grief within i 
for this my act that if my blood will serve 
to save her life I will make no price of it 
yet can I not imagine that the king 
will have be so enrage or if he will 
I have no time to think of it before 

no time who bid thou hasten to the ruin 
of thy poor father and thy family 
the message which come to do we hurt 
be speedy but the good come slow on 

but sir remember what a strait we be in 
it will concern we to invent some way 
to save my sister though the shepherd die 
he will deserve it for his bold attempt 

go take thy way whither thou will thyself 
that way be best which lead i to my grave Exit 

what luck be this this be more haste than speed 
I be resolve though my life lie at stake 
to stand the fury of the enrage king 
who know but he may be as sorry for 
his sudden act as I for i it be here 
to save she though it cost her lover dear 

madam for my poor self I do not fear 
but when I think on you and how your name 
and state that be so eminent must needs 
receive a certain scandal and foul blot 
if we be see together blame i not 
though I do fear or doubt what cruel fate 
angry with man that give we heart alike 
and fortune so asunder you be a cedar 
I a poor shrub that may look up unto you 
with adoration but never reach your height 

but Thyrsis I do love you love and death 
do not much differ they make all thing equal 
the monument of king may show for they 
what they have be but look upon their dust 
the colour and the weight of they and beggar 
you will find the same and if amongst live man 
nature have print in the face of many 
the character of nobleness and worth 
who fortune envy they a worthy place 
in birth or honour when the great man 
who she have court bear the mark of slave 
love sure will look on those and lay aside 
the accident of wealth and noble blood 
and in our thought will equal they with king 

it be true divine lady that the soul 
of all man be alike of the same substance 
by the same maker into all infuse 
but yet the several matter which they work on 
how different they be I need not tell you 
and as these outward organ give our soul 
or more or less room as they be contrive 
to show their lustre so again come fortune 
and darken they to who the god have give 
a soul divine and body capable 
of that divinity and excellence 
but it be the order of the fate who cause 
we must not look into but you dear madam 
nature and fortune have conspire to make 
the happy alive 

ay i most wretched 
what pleasure can there be in high state 
which be so cross in love the great good 
the god can tell how to bestow on man 

yet some do reckon it the great ill 
a passion of the mind form in the fancy 
and breed to be the worst disease of reason 

they that think so be such as love exclude 
man full of age or foul deformity 
no Thyrsis let not we profane that deity 
love be divine the seed of every thing 
the cause why now we live and all the world 

love be divine for if religion 
bind we to love the god who never yet 
reveal themselves in any thing to we 
but their bright image the fair creature 
who be our daily object love they 
we exercise religion let we not 
be scrupulous or fear the god have care 
of we and of our piety 

but take heed 
we can be too wary many thing 
oppose our will yet if you think it fit 
and this night silence will so favour we 
we will go together if we quit this country 
it be no matter all the world to i 
will be Arcadia if I may enjoy 
thy company my love 

no Sylvia 
pardon i dear if still I call you so 
enjoy your fortune think how much your honour 
must suffer in this act for i I find 
it be enough that I have ever love you 
now let i at the light of your bright eye 
burn like the bird who fire renew her nest 
I shall leave you behind i to the world 
the phoenix of true love and constancy 
nor be that bird more glorious in her flame 
than I shall be in i though they consume i 

it must not be for know my dear shepherd 
I shall not tell one minute after thou 
I find my soul so link to thou that death 
can divide we 

what then shall we do 
shall we resolve to live thus till we gaze 
our eye out first and then lose all our sense 
in their succession shall we strive to leave 
our soul breathe forth upon each other lip 
Come let we practise this our envious fate 
can deny we Cleander enter 

what a sight be this 
to meet her father this will make he mad 
indeed and execute his rage himself 
madam your father be here 

ha Delia 
Cleander be it thou than I be betray 
the second time but must thy fortune make thou 
the instrument of my undo still 

shepherd I will not honour thou so much 
as to inquire thy name thou have do that 
thou will pay dear for and I hope thy death 
will take away the blot of this disgrace 
thou have lay upon the princess 

if you do this 
you will make i happy it be this I look for 
my trivial act of life this of my death 
will recompense with glory I shall die 
to save my princess and what be more to save 
the life of her life her unspotted honour 
bless lady though you be as innocent 
and chaste as pure virgin that have yet 
see nothing in a dream to warm their blood 
yet the malicious world the censure people 
that haste to cast dirt on the fair thing 
will hardly spare you if it once be know 
that we be here together as for i 
my life be nothing but variety 
of grief and trouble which with constancy 
I have bear yet it be time that now I die 
before I do accuse the god that have 
bring i to this and so pull on my death 
a punishment will you be merciful 
and end i quick 

shepherd know for this 
thy resolution which in noble blood 
I scarce have find I willing will grant 
what thou desire but something must be know 
before that time either from you or you 

I know Cleander it be i you aim at 
I do confess this shepherd be my love 
for his sake I do leave the court and thou 
unworthy as thou be to be his rival 

madam my duty bid i speak to you 
not as a lover now but as you be 
my princess and the daughter of my king 
I will not for the world have those desire 
which I have then for sure my bold love 
will have transgress the limit of all duty 
and will have dare to tell you that this shepherd 
be not a match for great Arcadia heir 
nor yet one fit for my competitor 
it be not his outward feature which how fair 
it be I do not question that can make he 
noble or wise whereas my birth derive 
from ancient king and year not far unsuiting 
those of your own to these my education 
to you well know perhaps may make i worthy 
of be your servant 

can thou look on this 
this piece Cleander and not blush to boast 
thy folly thus seek to take away 
from his full virtue if but this one act 
of his appear unto the world as know 
it shall for I will not shame to publish he 
though I die for it will it not devour 
thy empty glory and thy puff up nothing 
and like a grave will bury all thy honour 
do take his life and glory in that act 
but be thou sure in he thou shall kill two 

what mean you madam 

not to live a minute 
after his death 

that all the god forbid 

no they command it rather that have make 
our soul but one Cleander thou be wont 
to be more courteous and I do see 
some pity in thou if not for pity sake 
yet for thy own good spare this life and take 
i for thou know when I be dead this kingdom 
thy father will inherit or thyself 
it be but the wait of a old man death 
who can long outlive i will you do it 

sir you be noble I do see you be 
you love this lady once by that dear love 
with i it be a conjuration 
to draw my soul out while I be so happy 
I do beseech you spare her noble life 
her death will sit full heavy on your soul 
and in your height of kingly dignity 
disturb that head which crown will give no rest to 
to take my life be justice 

Rather i 
I have offend in first love he 
and now betray he unto his end 

be not so cruel madam to yourself 
and i to envy i a death so noble 
sir as you hope your love shall ever prosper 
your great design your fight whatever they be 
as you do hope for peace in your last hour 
and that the earth may light cloth your ash 
dispatch i quick send i to my death 

a strange contention madam will you please 
a little to retire it be your honour 
that I do strive to save as well as life 
pray do not cross my purpose I shall do 
something that you may thank i for 

Cleander 
save but the shepherd and I will crown thy merit 

will you be please to enter here 

but swear 
that thou will save he 

I shall do my best 
I dare not swear for it be not in my power 
to do what you command 

but will you swear 
to let i know of it before he die 

I will by heaven 

then I take my leave 
and Thyrsis be thou sure whatever fate 
attend thy life the same do govern i 
one kiss I must not be deny 

fie madam 
how low be this in you 

then thus we part 
to meet again I hope 

down stubborn heart 
will thou not break yet in my death I find 
nothing that be terrible but this farewell 
present my soul with all the pain of hell 

I be sorry that this business go not forward 

so be not I we be rid of so much trouble 

yet it be strange the king shall send for we 
and when we be come command we to return 

no it be not strange it be his will to do so 
but if you have a itch of dance friend 
next holiday we will have it among ourselves 
and every man shall dance with his own sweetheart 
what say you shepherd wil it not be as well 

it will be very fine but where be Thyrsis 

ay where be he you go along with he 
where do you leave he 

walk in a garden 
where when I come to call he he be go 

it seem he care not for our company 

neither for you nor any man beside 

he be much alter since his love be lose 
methinks he be nothing like the man he be 

well then beware my friend how you engage 
yourselves in love he be a fair example 
and Hylas too he be droop for his mistress 
Daphnis be mad they say if you have a mind 
to die or to run mad then be in love 

see where he come in what a fume he be 

I do not like his fume pray let we away 

Daphnis my love 
whither so fast 

now love deliver i 
and must you come to trouble i be go 
I can stay to hear thy tedious folly 

be all your vow then make but to abuse i 
be there not pain to punish perjure man 
and will they not overtake you 

alas poor fool 
the god do laugh at such slight perjury 
as come from lover 

yet it be no conquest 
to deceive one that will be credulous 
a simple maid that love you 

then I see 
there be no end of woman reason 
or else this may suffice thou that I can 
no nor I will not love thou 

never 

never 

go cruel man and if the god of love 
will hear my prayer thou in thy love shall thrive 
as I in i that when thou be forlorn 
thou may remember she thou now do scorn 

be these the thank I have for that rich jewel 
which I bestow on thou ungrateful man 

yes for a poison glass a precious jewel 

I do confess it be poison 

do you so 
and to do i a courtesy you kill she 

yet hear i she be not dead and if she be 
I will pay my life for she 

be sure thou shall 
but can thou hope for such a strong illusion 
to mock my sense do I not see her dead 

she do appear so what you think be death 
be but a lethargy though I profess not 
to draw the moon down from the sphere she be in 
or make the sun look bloody by my art 
yet be I well inform in everything 
this glass be make of and I know the effect 
it work and can discourse they 

let i hear they 

have patience and you shall the glass you see 
of this rare mirror which I give you be 
make of a memphian stone that have the power 
to bring a deadly sleep on all the sense 
with it to make the effect more strong be mingle 
the quintessence extract in a limbeck 
of the torpedo which have such a quality 
that if the fisher touch it with his hook 
a poison straight will creep through all his vein 
till it benumb his sense this compound 
and make into a glassy metal soon 
reflect upon the eye of he that look in it 
a sleepy poison which will stupefy 
the vital part yet he that give it i 
teach i the cordial water which he use 
to restore spirit and heat unto those vital 
and I have bring it with i for our purpose 
what have I wrong you now or be my present 
worthy the thanks you give i 

yet you be 
too blame that you will not tell i this before 
I give it she 

in that I show my love 
for I do fear your resolution 
though I be certain of recover she 

and what must now be do 

here where you find i 
I see she lay and bury in the clothes 
she wont to wear her father so will have it 
I wait on the funeral with purpose 
to see the stone lay hollow on her grave 
for fear of hurt she 

it be well do 

here I will apply my medicine you shall see 
whether I lie or no 

let we lose no time 
I long to see my love alive again 

then help to lift this stone see where she lie 
the same Nerina 

she be dead I see 

love be still full of fear give i the water 

here but take heed it do not spoil her face 

if she be dead you need not fear the change 
of any colour what a child be love 

the god I see will not let beauty die 
she breathe she stir her eye begin to open 
as after sleep o miracle 

how now 
Is she alive will you believe your sense 
now I have put she in your hand be sure 
you do not let she go and lose no time 
if you give credit to her word you be lose 
what can woman word and flattery 
effect with simple lover think on that 
be confident I will leave you to your fate 

you god where be I now what place be this 
what light be this I see be the same thing 
see in this new world as they be in the other 
or in the grave do man see water tree 
as I do now and all thing as I live 
but sure I live still if I do why then 
be I here bury among these flower 
sure I be dead but yet I walk and speak 
and I have hear that those who once be dead 
can never use their voice or action 
but who be this I see here Daphnis ha 
be you dead too as well as I

I live to be the servant of Nerina 

ay so say Hylas while I live with he 

she think of Hylas still what shall I do 

but tell i Daphnis in what place be I 

in Daphnis heart you live and ever do 

and so say Hylas when we live together

where love and silence shall befriend we best 

but tell i Daphnis be not I once dead

to what purpose

beside the world not dream but you be 
dead and here bury we two may live 
together without be know to any

for ever to obey have make he i 
by give his consent which have not be 
but for this trick of you

in all I can till you will find a trick 
to put yourself beside she 

I forgive he 
for though it be ill mean yet do it sort 
by accident unto my good 

but will 
our law permit a ravisher to live 

no no Montanus let he live and envy 
our present happiness 

Cover you god 
the world in public ruin or else show i 
a way to hide my shame 

what will he do 

he will go hang himself what plot he have 
to fool himself with 

they that practise trick 
find they as jade that throw they first then kick they 
as his have do 

Come shepherd let we away 
and solemnize these nuptial 

stay Montanus 
do the king send for you 

he do 

and how 

the message come from Thyrsis 

I will go with you 
it be strange the king shall send for you pray heaven 
Thyrsis have do no mischief there he be handsome 
of a good grace and move eloquence 
perhaps some lady may have take he 
up for herself and he I will lay a wager 
will be so squeamish that if Sylvia 
come in his mind he never will do she reason 
and then her plot will be how to betray he 
will I be in his place 

I will thou be 
so he be safe 

I will comply never fear it 
they live a heavenly life of love in court 
to that which we do here a mistress there 
will satisfy the long of her lover 
and never trouble Hymen for the matter 
then if they like not they may look elsewhere 

thou will be punish one day for thy mischief 

the mischief be in my tongue I never do any 

no I have hear that Stella be with child 
by thou and thou must father it 

who I 
take i at that once father of child 
and make i common father of they all 
a child be a pretty thing and I shall joy 
to see one of my own I will tell thou truth 
Montanus by this hand I never lie 
with any woman in my life 

how then 
you have court all who be it that Mirtillus 
have not profess to love 

I do confess it 
and that be all I can do for before 
I can get earnest of any one love 
to who I make address even she will say 
you have another mistress go to she 
I will not be her stale and so by this mean 
nor this nor that will do i any reason 

you have ill luck it seem it be not your fault 

no for if they will believe i I do swear 
I have no other pray Montanus tell i 
for you have know the several way of woo 
which be the best and safe 

o Mirtillus 
grey hair have put the wild thought of love 
out of my head cold blood and freeze limb 
fright all those heat away in place of which 
discretion and sobriety shall come 

but I have hear old man do sometime love 

they dote Mirtillus give it the right name 
in old man blood Cupid do quench his flame 
but as we go I will tell thou not to love 
at all be best but if you needs must love 
love one and seek no further thou will find 
enough of she if once she prove unkind 

have you be sudden as I counsel you 
you have not fail but you young man do never 
go through with any thing 

for heaven sake 
call not that wicked deed to my remembrance 
I do repent i that I ever begin it 
I will not for a world have end it 
nerina chaste and fair and I a villain 
leave i I pray for something tell i you 
do first advise i to this damn act 

nay if you prize my friendship at this rate 
I will leave you to your penance Exit 

this old man 
be full of malice nothing trouble he 
the ill that he have do fly from his thought 
and he rejoice that he do they quaint 
I have begin my youth as if I mean 
to have my age so punish as his be enter Dorinda 
who be this Dorinda I have do she wrong 
I sue for love to her first which obtain 
I stick disgrace on she let i ask 
forgiveness now for it be too much to hope 
that she shall love one stain with such a deed 
as I have do so foul and impious 

great love if yet thou be not satisfy 
with all the wrong I have sustain for thou 
my blood I hope thy anger will appease 
which thou may glut thyself with 

gentle nymph 

I have be too gentle do not mock i with it 
oh Daphnis be it you this be not well 
to mock i thus your look when arm with frown 
give not my heart so deep a wound as this 

I mean no scorn I come to ask your pardon 
for what I have do already not to heap 
more sin upon my head 

it be very strange 

but true Dorinda will you spit upon i 
take your revenge for I have well deserve it 

but be this serious Daphnis o take heed 
crack not my heart with such a load of grief 
and scorn so press as this be if you do 
the god will punish it for though they have 
neglect i thus long they will revenge 
such injury as these 

my many ill 
discredit my repentance if my word 
can find no faith with you believe my tear 
indeed they be not feign 

Even so you look 
when first you steal my heart but I forgive you 
whatever become of i I still must love you 

forgive i first and then I will begin 
by my endeavour and true service 
to deserve something of you if not love 

there be not that hard heartedness in man 
which I do think for he repent I see 
oh Daphnis if thou mean not this as scorn 
take i into thy arm and I will be 
thy slave 

o say not so let i 
rather be thou it will be pride in i 
to be ambitious of it 

o my heart 
what sudden joy thou strike into it now 
but yet methinks I fear thou do not love i 

why shall you fear by pan you be to i 
whatever you can imagine equal above 
all that I ere think fair and if you be 
content to hide my fault and take i to 
your nuptial bed which yet I dare not hope 
but if you will when ere that day shall come 
the embrace of my love and i shall be 
such as the cyprian boy from our abundance 
shall take his fire to kindle other heart 
yet leave with we a flame which we will cherish 
and keep alive unto eternity 

woman be ever credulous most then 
when knowledge of the truth will but afflict they 
I dare not now distrust you though I know 
what you have say be false it have a semblance 
of such a please truth give i thy hand 
and take thou i while we walk thus entwine 
I shall think Daphnis never be unkind 

no sir they live and Hymen in his band 
have tie they both the happy knot that ere 
knit two such equal heart and love together 
o I be ravish with the news my joy 
be great now then if she have be the daughter 
unto our king and I have marry she 

I be amaze pray Jove thou be not mad 

somewhat exalt sir beyond my myself 
but yet not mad go sir unto the king

and know that I have news to make he live 
and you a age yet long

it be true 

but what be true

if she do live I think 
she will but yet you know we be command 
to cut that life off 

but your hasty son

and both be marry

do stand i from i my servant hand 
tremble for fear 
presage what a sin they be to act 
he bid he be assure he will not start 
and often call he to dispatch he quick 

what man can have a heart for such a deed 
and see his face 

the prince before he come 
to put the fatal twist about his neck 
beseech i as I ever hope for peace 
I shall preserve the princess this I promise 
and whatsoever else he will desire 
he answer nothing now but hasty death 
then strip off his doublet I espy 
with a quick eye this golden circle here 
when hasty I bid my servant hold 
and let he go he ask i why I stay 
I tell he that about his neck be sacred 
he will have rend it off but I forbid it 

what do you then 

sir I do well remember 
what I have hear of the oracle and you 
which with the computation of his year 
I find agree to make up a truth 
which you before assure i then I ask he 
whether he will be marry to the princess 
before he die he think that I have mock he 
and say I practise tyranny upon he 
then go I to my sister and desire 
the same of she in fine I see they both 
join hand and heart together but the prince 
think this a dream of life which certain death 
will wake he from until I do assure he 
of his great state and that his love who now 
he think to be the princess be my sister 
all which I do refer unto your knowledge 

this day for ever let it holy be 
and you who love have bring through deep despair 
unto the haven of your happiness 
enjoy each other free of you brave shepherd 
but now my prince I shall inquire anon 
where and with who you live

and in the honour of your nuptial 
I have a song which if your grace will hear 
it will entertain the time 

let it be sing 

Hymen God of marriage bed 
be thou ever honour 
thou who torch pure light 
death sad taper do affright 
and instead of funeral fire 
kindle lover chaste desire 
may their love 
ever prove 
true and constant let not age 
know their youthful heat to assuage 
maid prepare the genial bed 
then come night and hide that red 
which her cheek his heart do burn 
till the envious day return 
and the lusty bridegroom say 
I have chase her fear away 
and instead 
of virgin head 
give she a great good 
perfection and womanhood 

thank good Mirtillus this indeed be proper 
unto your subject

the child thou think be thou thou shall not be 

Calligone be not my child proceed 

his life shall be obscure twice shall thy hate 
doom he to death yet shall he escape that fate 

it be true that twice I do command his death 
first think he a bastard than a shepherd 
for his offence the god be just go on 

and thou shall live to see that not long after 
thy only son shall wed thy only daughter 

this be a riddle ever till this day 
their marriage have make it plain Eubulus 
call in Archigenes and call thy daughter 
the fair Calligone that I may pour 
my blessing on they and I long to see 
those character thou write about his neck 
that I may call he i

Archigenes come near for thou be 
a stranger yet although thou be my son

to express my joy for these and thank to you

throughout my kingdom and Eubulus see 
that every thing be fit for their honour 
Come let we to the temple that we may 
with holy sacrifice appease the god 
who great decree though we do strive to hinder 
yet be they now fulfil it be in vain 
to oppose the fate who law do all constrain exeunt
