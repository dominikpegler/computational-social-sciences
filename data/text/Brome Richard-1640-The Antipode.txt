regard you bear your husband lest I send you 
upon a further pilgrimage than he 
feign to convey my son 

o jealousy 

do you think sir to the antipode such a journey 

I think there be none beyond it and that Mandevile 
who excellent work this be be the only man 
that ever come near it 

Mandevile go far 

beyond all english leg that I can read of 

what think you sir of drake our famous countryman 

Drake be a didapper to Mandevile 
candish and Hawkins Furbisher all our voyager 
go short of Mandevile but have he reach 
to this place here yes here this wilderness 
and see the tree of the sun and moon that speak 
and tell king Alexander of his death he then 
have leave a passage open for traveller 
that now be keep and guard by wild beast 
dragon and serpent elephant white and blue 
unicorn and lion of many colour 
and monster more as numberless as nameless 

stay there 

Read here else can you read 
be it not true 

no true than I have see it 

have you be there sir have you see those tree 

And talk with they and taste of their fruit 

Read here again then it be write here 
that you may live four or five hundred year 

bring you none of that fruit home with you sir 

you will have some of it will you to have hope 
to outlive your husband by it

your patience both I pray I know the grief 
you both do labour with and how to cure it 

will I have give you half my land it be do 

will I have give he half my love to settle 
the other half free from encumbrance 
upon my husband 

do not think it strange sir 
I will make your eye witness of more 
than i relate if you will but travail with i 
you hear i not deny that all be true 
that Mandevile deliver of his travail 
yet i myself may be as well believe 

since you speak reverent of he say on 

of Europe I will not speak it be too near home 
who be not familiar with the spanish garb 
the Italian shrug french cringe and German hug 
nor will i trouble you with my observation 
fetch from Arabia Paphlagonia 
Mesopotamia Mauritania 
Syria Thessalia Persia India 
all still be too near home though I have touch 
the cloud upon the pyrenaean mountain 
and be on Paphos isle where I have kiss 
the image of bright Venus all be still 
too near home to be boast 

that I like well in he too he will not boast of kiss 
a woman too near home 

these thing in i be poor they find 
in a far traveller care 
like the report of those that beg 
have put out on return from Edinburgh 
Paris or Venice or perhaps Madrid 
whither a milliner may with half a nose 
smell out his way and be not never so difficult 
as for some man in debt and unprotect 
to walk from Charingcross to the old exchange 
no i will pitch no near than the antipode 
that which be far distant foot to foot 
against our region 

what with their heel upward 
bless we how escape they break of their neck 

they walk upon firm earth as we do here 
and have the firmament over their head 
as we have here 

and yet just under we 
where be hell then if they who foot be towards we 
at the low part of the world have heaven too 
beyond their head where be hell 

you may find that 
without inquiry cease your idle question 

sure hell be above ground then in jealous husband 

what people sir i pray proceed what people 
be they of the antipode be they not such 
as Mandevile write of without head or neck 
have their eye place on their shoulder and 
their mouth amid their breast 

i so indeed 
though heel go upward and their foot shall slip 
they have no neck to break 

silence sweet lady 
pray give the gentleman leave to understand i 
the people through the whole world of antipode 
in outward feature language and religion 
resemble those to who they be supposite 
they under Spain appear like Spaniard 
under France Frenchman under England english 
to the exterior show but in their manner 
their carriage and condition of life 
extreme contrary to come close to you 
what part of the world antipode shall i now 
decipher to you or will you travail to 

the further off 

that be the antipode of England 
the people there be contrary to we 
as thus here heaven be praise the magistrate 
govern the people there the people rule 
the magistrate 

there be precious bribe then 

you will hold your peace 

nay lady it be by nature 
here general man govern the woman 

I will they can else 

you will hold your peace 

but there the woman overrule the man 
if some man fail here in their power some woman 
slip their hold there as parent here and master 
command there they obey the child and servant 

but pray sir be it by nature or by art 
that wife oversway their husband there 

by nature 

then art be above nature as they be under we 

in brief sir all 
degree of people both in sex and quality 
deport themselves in life and conversation 
quite contrary to we 

why then the woman 
do get the man with child and put the poor fool 
to grievous pain I warrant you in bear 

into your chamber get you in I charge you 

by no mean as you tender your son good 
no lady no that be to make man woman 
and woman man but there the maid do woe 
the bachelor and it be most probable 
the wife lie uppermost 

that be a trim 
upsidedown antipodian trick indeed 

and then at christen and gossip feast 
a woman be not see the man do all 
the tittletattle duty while the woman 
hunt hawk and take their pleasure 

have they good game I pray sir 

excellent 
but by the contrary to we for where 
we hawk at pheasant partridge mallard Heron 
with goshawk Tarsell falcon Laneret 
our hawk become their game our game their hawk 
and so the like in hunt there the deer 
pursue the hound and which you may think strange 
I have see one sheep worry a dozen fox 
by moonshine in a morning before day 
they hunt traynesent with ox and blow with dog 

Hugh hugh hugh 

be not their swan all black and raven white 

yes indeed be they and their parrot teach 
their mistress to talk 

that be very strange 

they keep their cat in cage 
from mouse that will devour they else and bird 
teach they to whistle and cry beware the rat puss 
but these be frivolous nothing I have know 
great lady ride great horse run at tilt 
at ring race and hunt match while 
their lord at home have paint pawn their plate 
and jewel to feast their honourable servant 
and there the merchant wife do deal abroad 
beyond sea while their husband cuckold they 
at home 

then there be cuckold too it seem 
as well as here 

then you conclude here be 

by hearsay sir I be not wise enough 
to speak it on my knowledge yet 

not yet 

patience good sir 

Hugh hugh hugh 

what do you laugh that there be cuckoldmaking 
in the antipode I tell you sir 
it be not so abhor here as it be hold 
in reputation there all your old man 
do marry girl and old woman boy 
as generation be to be maintain 
only by cuckold make 

monstrous 

pray your patience 
there be no such honest man there in their world 
as be their lawyer they give away 
their practice and to enable they to do so 
be all handicraft or labour man 
they work poor heart full hard in the vacation 
to give their law for nothing in the term time 
no fee be take which make their divine 
be general covetous the great wrangler 
in law suit of a kingdom you have not there 
a gentleman in debt though citizen 
haunt they with cap in hand to take their ware 
on credit 

what fine sport will that be here now 

all wit and mirth and good society 
be there among the hireling clown and tradesman 
and all their poet be Puritan 

have they poet 

and player too but they be all the sober 
precise people pick out of a nation 

I never see a play

be govern sir your jealousy will grow 
a worse disease than your son madness else

after a thousand mile a hour outright 
by sea and land and shall awake anon

be all in readiness and I think all perfect 
but one that never will be perfect in a thing 
he study yet he make such shift extempore 
know the purpose what he be to speak to 
that he move mirth in i above all the rest 
for I be none of those poetic fury 
that threat the actor life in a whole play 
that add a syllable or take away 
if he can fribble through and move delight 
in other I be please 

it be that mimic fellow which your lordship 
but late entertain 

the same

we will write as we return sir and it be true 
you sleep most part of the journey hitherward 
the air be so somniferous and it be well 
you escape the calenture by it 

but how long do you think I sleep 

eight month and some odd day 
which be but as so many hour and minute 
of one own natural country sleep 

eight month 

it be nothing for so young a brain 
How think you one of the seven christian champion 
David by name sleep seven year in a leekbed 

I think I have read it in their famous history 

but what chief thing of note now in our travel 
can you call present to mind speak like a traveller 

I do remember as we pass the verge 
of the upper world come down downhill 
the set sun then bid they good night 
come glide easy down by we and strike 
new day before we light we our way 
but with such heat that till he be get far 
before we we even melt 

Well wrought potion very well observe sir 
but now we be come into a temperate clime 
of equal composition of element 
with that of London and as well agreeable 
unto our nature as you have find that air 

I never be at London

this sir be anti London that be the antipode 
to the grand city of our nation

note his attire his language and behaviour 

Oure far fetch title over land and sea 
offer unto your view the antipode 
but what antipode now shall you see 
even those that foot to foot against London be 
because no traveller that know that state 
shall say we personate or imitate 
they in our action for nothing can 
almost be speak but some or other man 
take it unto himself and say the stuff 
if it be vicious or absurd enough 
be weave upon his back far far be all 
that bring such prejudice mix with their gall 
this play shall no satiric Timist be 
to tax or touch at either he or thou 
that be notorious it be so far below 
thing in our orb that do among we flow 
that no degree from Keyser to the clown 
shall say this vice or folly be i own 

This have be well now if you have not dream

that russian coachman that dare lift a hand

the coachman be poor and scarce his twelvemoneths wage 
though it be five mark a year will satisfy
