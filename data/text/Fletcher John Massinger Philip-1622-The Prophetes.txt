that he dare not venture to appear in open 
and show his warlike face among the soldier 
the tenderness and weakness of his eye 
be not able to endure the sun yet 
slave that he be he give out this infirmity 
because he will dispatch his honour too 
to arise from wantonness and love of woman 
and thus he juggle still 

o most pernicious 
most bloody and most base Alas dear brother

load with shame and lie those pious tear 
thou daily shower upon my father monument 
when in the persian expedition 
he fall unfortunate by a stroke of thunder 
make thy defame and sin those weep out eye 
the fair example of a noble nature 
those holy drop of love turn by depraver 
malicious poison tongue to thy abuse 
we must not suffer this

he will not now come near i 

no he dare not 
he have a inmate here that be call a conscience 
bid he keep off 

my brother honour he 
make he first captain of his guard his next friend 
then to my mother to assure he near 
he make he husband 

and withal ambitious 
for when he tread so nigh his false foot itch sir

beyond a virgin care how still he flight i 
and put i still off with your prophecy 
and the performance of your late prediction 
that when he be emperor than he will marry i

for by this time I guess he come from hunt 
and by my art I find this very instant 
some great design be afoot

I shall turn Jew if I carry many such burden 
do you think master to be emperor

and there we step before you thickskinned tanner 
for we be bear three story high no base one 
none of your groundling master 

I like thou well 
thou have a good mind as I have to this honour 

as good a mind sir of a simple plasterer 
and when I come to execute my office 
than you shall see 

what 

a officer in fury 
a officer as he ought to be do you laugh at it 
be a senator in hope worth no more reverence 
by these hand I will clap you by the heel the first hour of it 

on my conscience the fellow believe 

I do do Geta 
for if I once be emperor 

then will I 
for wise man must be have to prop the republic 
not bate you a single ace of a sound senator 

but what shall we do the while 

Kill swine and souse they

Come take he up I say and see he dress

and get some of he ready for our dinner

and get some piece of he ready present 
we be weary both and hungry 

I will about it 
what a inundation of brewis shall I swim in Exit 

thou be ever dull and melancholy cousin 
distrustful of my hope 

why can you blame i 
do man give credit to a juggler 

thou know she be a prophetess 

a small one 
and as small profit to be hope for by she 

thou be the strange man how do thy hurt 
the boar come near you sir 

a scratch a scratch 

it ache and trouble thou and that make thou angry 

not at the pain but at the practice uncle 
the butcherly base custom of our life now 
have a brave enemy sword draw so much from i 
or danger meet i in the head of the army 
to have blush thus in my blood have be my honour 
but to live base like swineherd and believe too 
to be fool out with tale and old wife dream 
dream when they be drink 

certain you much mistake she 

mistake she hang she to be make her purveyor 
to feed her old chap to provide she daily 
and bring in feast while she sit fart at we 
and blow out her prophecy at both end 

prithee be wise do thou think Maximinian 
so great a reverence and so stay a knowledge 

surreverence you will say what truth 
what knowledge 
what any thing but eat be good in she 
it will make a fool prophesy to be feed continual 
what do you get your labour and your danger 
while she sit bathe in her lard fury 
inspire with full deep cup who can prophesy 
a tinker out of ale will give prediction 
but who believe 

Shee be a holy Druid 
a woman note for that faith that piety 
belove of heaven 

heaven know I do not believe it 
Indeed I must confess they be excellent juggler 
their age upon some fool too fling a confidence 
but what ground have they what element to work on 
show i but that the sieve and shears a learned one 
I have no patience to dispute this question 
it be so ridiculous I think the devil do help they 
or rather mark i well abuse they uncle 
for they be as fit to deal with he these old woman 
they be as jump and square out to his nature 

thou have a perfect malice 

so I will have 
against these purblind prophet for look you sir 
old woman will lie monstrous so will the devil 
or else he have have much wrong upon my knowledge 
old woman be malicious so be he 
they be proud and covetous revengeful lecherous 
all which be excellent attribute of the devil 
they will at last seem holy so will he 
and to vail over these villainy they will prophesy 
he give they leave now and then to use their cunning 
which be to kill a cow or blast a harvest 
make young pig pipe themselves to death choke poultry 
and chafe a dairywench into a fever 
with pump for her butter 
but when he make these agent to raise emperor 
when he dispose fortune as his servant 
and tie she to old wife tail 

go thy way 
thou be a learned scholar against credit 
you hear the prophecy 

yes and I laugh at it 
and so will any man can tell but twenty 
that be not blind as you be blind and ignorant 
do you think she know your fortune 

I do think it 

I know she have the name of a rare soothsayer 
but do you in your conscience believe her holy 
inspire with such prophetic fire 

yes in my conscience 

and that you must upon necessity 
from her word be a Caesar 

if I live 

there be 〈◊〉 ●top yet 

and follow her direction 

but do not juggle with i 

in faith cousin 
so full a truth hang ever on her prophecy 
that how I shall think otherwise 

very well sir 
you then believe for methinks it be most necessary 
she know her own fate 

I believe it certain 

dare you but be so wise to let i try it 
for I stand doubtful 

how 

come near to i 
because her cunning devil shall not prevent i 
close close and hear if she can turn this destiny 
I will be of your faith too 

forward I fear not 
for if she know not this sure she know nothing 
I be so confident 

i'faith so be I too 
that I shall make her devil side humh 

Shee come here 
go take your stand

and he that hope must give his hope their current

but I be no emperor 
why do you fool i thus and make i follow 
your flatter expectation hour by hour 
Rise early and sleep late to feed your appetite 
forget my trade my arm forsake my honour 
labour and sweat to arrive at a base memory 
oppose myself to hazard of all sort 
only to win the barbarous name of butcher

but you be cunning mother 
and with that cannon and the faith I give you 
you lead i blind to no end no honour 
you find you be daily feed you take no labour

as he believe the earth be in his fathom 
this make he quite forget his humble be 
and can I hope that he that only feed 
with the imagine food of future empire 
disdain even those that give he mean and life 
to nourish such desire when he be possess 
of his ambitious end which must fall on he 
or your prediction be false will ever 
descend to look on i 

Were his intent 
perfidious as the sea or wind his heart 
compose of falsehood yet the benefit 
the greatness of the good he have from you 
for what I have confer be thou Drusilla 
must make he firm and thankful but if all 
remembrance of the debt he stand engage for 
find a quick grave in his ingratitude 
my powerful art that guide he to this height 
shall make he curse the hour he ere be raise 
or sink he to the centre 

I have rather 
your art can force he to return that ardour 
to i I bear to he or give i power 
to moderate my passion yet I know not 
I shall repent your grant though you have sign it 
so well I find he be worthy of all service 
but to believe that any check to he 
in his main hope can yield content to i 
be treason to true love that know no pleasure 
the object that be dote on ill affect 

pretty simplicity I love thou for it 
and will not sit a idle looker on 
and see it cozen dry thy innocent eye 
and cast off jealous fear yet promise 
be but lipcomfort and but fancy aught 
that be possible in nature or in art 
that may advance thy comfort and be bold 
to tell thy soul it be thou therefore speak free 

you new create i to conceal from you 
my virgin fondness be to hide my sickness 
from my physician oh dear aunt I languish 
for want of Diocles sight he be the sun 
that keep my blood in a perpetual spring 
but in his absence cold benumb winter 
seize on all my faculty will you bind i 
that be your slave already in more fetter 
and in the place of service to adore you 
o bear i then but it be impossible 
I fear to be effect where I may 
see how my Diocles break through his danger 
and in what heap his honour flow upon he 
that I may meet he in the height and pride 
of all his glory and there as your gift 
challenge he as my own 

enjoy thy wish 
this be a easy boon which at thy year 
I can have give to any but now grow 
perfect in all the hide mystery 
of that inimitable art which make we 
equal even to the god and nature wonder 
it shall be do as fit my skill and glory 
to break through bolt and lock a scholar prize 
for thief and picklock to pass through a army 
cover with night or some disguise the practice 
of poor and needy spy no my Drusilla 
from Ceres I will force her wing dragon 
and in the air hang over the tribunal 
the music of the sphere attend on we 
there as his good star thou shall shine upon he 
if he prove true and as his angel guard he 
but if he dare be false ay in a moment 
will put that glorious light out with such horror 
as if the eternal night have seize the sun 
or all thing be return to the first chaos 
and then appear like fury 

I will do 
whatever you shall command 

rest then assure 
I be the mistress of my art and fear not exeunt 

your care of your sick emperor fellowsoldier 
in colour to the life do show your love 
and zealous duty oh continue in it 
and though I know you long to see and hear he 
impute it not to pride or melancholy 
that keep you from your wish such statevice 
too too familiar with great prince be 
stranger to all the action of the life 
of good Numerianus let your patience 
be the physician to his wound eye 
wound with pious sorrow for his father 
which time and your strong patience will recover 
provide it prove constant 

if he counterfeit 
I will hereafter trust a prodigal heir 
when he weep at his father funeral 

or a young widow follow a bedrid husband 
after a three year groan to the fire 

note his humility and with what soft murmur 
he do inquire his pleasure 

and how soon 
he be instruct 

how he bow again too 

all your command dread Caesar I will impart 
to your most ready soldier to obey they 
so take your rest in peace it be the pleasure 
of mighty Caesar his thank still remember 
for your long patience which a donative 
fit his state to give shall quick follow 
that you continue a strict guard upon 
his sacred person and admit no stranger 
of any other legion to come near he 
you be most trust by he I receive 
your answer in your silence now Camurius 
speak without flattery have thy Aper act 
this passion to the life 

I will applaud he 
be he salute Caesar but I fear 
these long protract counsel will undo we 
and it be beyond my reason he be dead 
you shall conceal yourself or hope it can 
continue undiscovered 

that I have kill he 
yet feed these ignorant fool with hope he live 
have a main end in it the pannonian cohort 
that be my own and sure be not come up 
the German legion waver and Charinus 
brother to this dead dog hell plague on Niger 
be jealous of the murder and I hear 
be march up against i it be not safe 
till I have power to justify the act 
to show myself the author be therefore careful 
for a hour or two till I have full sound 
how the tribune and centurion stand affect 
that none come near the litter if I find they 
firm on my part I dare profess myself 
and then live aper equal 

do not the body 
begin to putrify 

that exact my haste 
when but even now I feign obedience to it 
as I have some great business to impart 
the send have almost choke i be therefore curious 
all keep at distance Exit 

I be teach my part 
haste you to perfect you 

I have rather meet 
a enemy in the field then stand thus nod 
like to a ruggowned watchman 

the watch at noon 
this be a new device 

stand 

I be arm 
against all danger 

if I fear to follow 
a coward name pursue i 

now my fate 
guide and direct i 

you be rude and saucy 
with your forbid foot to touch this ground 
sacred to Caesar only and to these 
that do attend his person speak what be you 

what thou nor any of thy faction be 
nor ever be soldier and honest man 

so blunt 

nay you shall find he be good at the sharp too 

no instrument of craft engine of murder 
that serve the emperor only with oil tongue 
sooth and applaud his vice play the bawd 
to all his appetite and when you have wrought 
so far upon his weakness that he be grow 
odious to the subject and himself 
and can no further help your wicked end 
you rid he out of the way 

treason 

it be truth 
and I will make it good 

lay hand upon they 
or kill they sudden 

I be out at that 
I do not like the sport 

what be he that be 
owner of any virtue worth a roman 
or do retain the memory of the oath 
he make to Caesar that dare lift his sword 
against the man that careless of his life 
come to discover such a horrid treason 
as when you hear it and understand how long 
you have be abuse will run you mad with fury 
I be no stranger but like you a soldier 
train up one from my youth and there be some 
with who I have serve and not to praise myself 
must needs confess they have see Diocles 
in the late Britain war both dare and do 
beyond a common man 

Diocles 

I know he 
the brave soldier of the empire 

stand 
if thou advance a inch thou be dead 

die thou 
that dare oppose thyself against a truth 
that will break out though mountain cover it 

I fear this be a suck pig no boar 
he fall so easy 

hear i fellow soldier 
and if I make it not apparent to you 
this be a act of justice and no murder 
cut i in piece I will disperse the cloud 
that have so long obscure a bloody act 
never equal yet you all know with what favour 
the good Numerianus ever grace 
the provost Aper 

true 

and that those bounty 
shall have contain he if he ere have learn 
the element of honesty and truth 
in loyal duty but ambition never 
look backward on desert but with blind haste

punish it in his family 

who but Aper 
the barbarous and most ingrateful Aper 
his desperate poniard print on his breast 
this deadly wound hate to vow enemy 
find a full satisfaction in death 
and tyrant seek no far he a subject 
and bind by all the tie of love and duty 
end not so but do deny his prince 
who ghost forbid passage to his rest

nay weep not let your love speak in your anger 
and to confirm you give no suffrage to

make he your leader 

a Diocles a Diocles 

we will force he from his guard and now my star

Fix here and rest a while your sailstretched wing 
that have outstrip the wind the eye of heaven

that my strong spell shall force she from her sphere 
such be the power of art 

good aunt where be we

these spacious street where every private house 
appear a palace to receive a king 
the site the wealth the beauty of the place 
will soon inform thou it be imperious Rome 
Rome the great mistress of the conquer world 

but without Diocles it be to i 
like any wilderness we have pass over 
shall I not see he 

yes and in full glory 
and glut thy greedy eye with look on 
his prosperous success contain thyself 
for though all thing beneath we be transparent 
the sharp sight be he eagleeyed 
can discover we nor will we hang 
idle spectator to behold his triumph 
but when occasion shall present itself 
do something to add to it see he come 

how godlike he appear with such a grace 
the giant that attempt to scale heaven 
when they lie dead on the phlegraean plain 
Mars do appear to Jove 

forbear 

look on this 
and when with horror thou have view thy deed 
thy most accurse deed be thy own judge 
and see thy guilt consider if thou can 
persuade thyself who thou stand bound to hate 
to hope or plead for mercy 

I confess 
my life be a burden to i 

thou be like thy name 
a cruel boar who snout have root up 
the fruitful vineyard of the commonwealth 
I long have hunt for thou and since now 
thou be in the toil it be in vain to hope 
thou ever shall break out thou do deserve 
the hangman hook or to be punish 
more majorum whip with rod to death 
or any way that be more terrible 
yet since my future fate depend upon thou 
thus to fulfil great delphia prophecy 
Aper thou fatal boar receive the honour 
to fall by Diocles hand shine clear my star 
that usher i to taste this common air 
in my entrance to the world and give applause 
to this great work music 

strike music from the sphere 

o now you honour i 

ha in the air 

miraculous 

This show the god approve 
the person and the act then if the senate 
for in their eye I read the soldier love 
think Diocles worthy to supply the place 
of dead Numerianus as he stand 
his heir in his revenge with one consent 
salute he emperor 

long live Diocles 
Augustus pater patriae and all title 
that be peculiar only to the Caesar 
we glad throw upon he 

we confirm it 
and will defend his honour with our sword 
against the world raise he to the tribunal 

fetch the imperial robe and as a sign 
we give he absolute power of life and death 
bind this sword to his side 

omit no ceremony 
that may be for his honour 

still the god 
express that they be please with this election 

my master be a emperor and I feel 
a senator itch upon i will I can hire 
these fine invisible fiddler to play to i 
at my instalment 

I embrace your love 
and hope the honour that you heap upon i 
shall be with strength support it shall be 
my study to appear another Atlas 
to stand firm underneath this heaven of empire 
and bear it bold I desire no title 
but as I shall deserve they I will keep 
the name I have be a private man 
only with some small difference I will add 
to Diocles but two short syllable 
and be call dioclesianus 

that be fine 
I will follow the fashion and when I be a senator 
I will be no more plain Geta but be call 
lord Getianus 

he never think of i 
nor of your favour enter Niger 

if he dare prove false 
these glory shall be to he as a dream 
or a enchant banquet 

from Charinus 
from great Charinus who with joy have hear 
of your proceed and confirm your honour 
he with his beauteous sister fair Aurelia 
be come in person like themselves attend 
to gratulate your fortune loud music 

for thy news 
be thou in France proconsul let we meet 
the emperor with all honour and embrace he 

o aunt I fear this princess do eclipse 
the opinion of my beauty though I be 
myself to be the judge 

rely on i 

it be virtue and not birth that make we noble 
great action speak great mind and such shall govern 
and you be grace with both thus as a brother 
a fellow and copartner in the empire 
I do embrace you may we live so far 
from difference or emulous competition 
that all the world may say although two body 
we have one mind 

when I look on the trunk 
of dear Numerianus I shall wash 
his wound with tear and pay a sister sorrow 
to his sad fate but since he live again 
in your most brave revenge I bow to you 
as to a power that give he second life 
and will make good my promise if you find 
that there be worth in i that may deserve you 
and that in be your wife I shall not bring 
disquiet and dishonour to your bed 
although my youth and fortune shall require 
both to be sue and seek to here I yield 
myself at your devotion 

o you god 
teach i how to be thankful you have pour 
all blessing on i that ambitious man 
can ever fancy till this happy minute 
I never see beauty or believe there can be 
perfection in a woman I shall live 
to serve and honour you upon my knee 
I thus receive you and so you vouchsafe it 
this day I be double marry to the empire 
and your bestself 

false and perfidious villain 

let i fall headlong on he oh my star 
this I foresee and fear 

call forth a flamen 
this knot shall now be tie 

but I will lose it 
if art or hell have any strength 

prodigious 

how soon the day be overcast 

the sign be fatal 
Juno smile not upon this match and show too 
she have her thunder 

can there be a stop 
in my full fortune 

we be too violent 
and I repent the haste we first shall pay 
our late duty to the dead and then 
proceed discreet let we take up the body 
and when we have place his ash in his urn 
we will try the god again for wise man say 
marriage and obsequy do not suit one day 

So it be defer yet in despite of falsehood 
comfort Drusilla for he shall be thou 
or wish in vain he be not I will punish ascend 
his perjury to the height mount up my bird 
some rite I be to perform to Hecate 
to perfect my design which once perform

or in his ruin I will bury all ascend throne 

what powerful star shine at this man nativity 
and bless his homely cradle with full glory 
what throng of people press and buzz about he 
and with their hum flattery sing he Caesar 
sing he aloud and grow hoarse with salute he 
how the fierceminded soldier steal in to he 
adore and court his honour at his devotion 
their life their virtue and their fortune lay 
Charinus sue the emperor entreat he 
and as a bright flame take his beam from he 
the bless and bright Aurelia she dote on he

so full of matter be our history 
yet mix I hope with sweet variety 
the accident not vulgar too but rare 
and fit to be present that there want 
room in this narrow stage and time to express 
in action to the life our Dioclesian 
in his full lustre yet as the statuary 
that by the large size of Alcides foot 
guess at his whole proportion so we hope 
your apprehensive judgement will conceive 
out of the shadow we can only show 
how fair the body be and will be please 
out of your wont goodness to behold 
as in a silent mirror what we can 
with fit conveniency of time allow 
for such presentment cloth in vocal sound 
yet with such art the subject be convey 
that every scene and passage shall be clear 
even to the gross understander here 
the skilful Delphia find by sure proof 
the presence of Aurelia dime the beauty 
of her Drusilla and in spite of charm 
the emperor her brother great Charinus 
still urge she to the love of Dioclesian 
deal with the persian legate that be bind 
for the ransom of Cassana to remove 
Aurelia Maximinian and Charinus 
out of the sight of Rome but take their oath 
in lieu of her assistance that they shall not 
on any term when they be in their power 
presume to touch their life this yield to 
they lie in ambush for they Dioclesian 
still mad for fair Aurelia that dote 
as much upon Maximinian twice have kill he 
but that her frown restrain he he pursue she 
with all humility but she continue 
proud and disdainful the sign give by Delphia 
the persian break through and seize upon 
Charinus and his sister with Maximinian 
and free Cassana for their speedy rescue 
enrage Dioclesian draw his sword 
and bid his guard assist he then too weak 
have be all opposition and resistance 
the persian can have make against their fury 
if Delphia by her cunning have not raise 
a foggy mist which as a cloud conceal they 
deceive their pursuer now be please 
that your imagination may help you 
to think they safe in Persia and Dioclesian 
for this disaster circle round with sorrow 
yet mindful of the wrong their future fortune 
we will present in action and be bold 
in that which follow that the most shall say 
it be well begin but the end crown the play 

talk not of comfort I have break my faith 
and the god fight against i and proud man

before the rage whirlwind of their justice 
what be it to be great adore on earth 
when the immortal power that be above we 
turn all our blessing into horrid curse 
and laugh at our resistance or prevention 
of what they purpose o the fury that 
I feel within i whip on by their anger 
for my tormentor can it else have be 
in nature that a few poor fugitive persian 
unfriended and unarm too can have robe i 
in Rome the world metropolis and her glory 
in Rome where I command environ round 
with such invincible troop that know no fear

to Delphia and Drusilla be the ground 
of my misfortune and I must remember 
while I be love and in great delphia grace 
she be as my good angel and bind fortune 
to prosper my design I must appease she 
let other pay their knee their vow their prayer 
to weak imagine power she be my all 
and thus I do invoke she know Delphia

to grace the earth with thy celestial step 
and taste this gross air thy heavenly spirit 
have free access to all the secret counsel 
which a full senate of the god determine 
when they consider man the brassleaved book 
of fate lie open to thou where thou read 
and fashion the destiny of man 
at thy wish pleasure look upon thy creature 
and as thou twice have please to appear 
to reprehend my falsehood now vouchsafe 
to see my low submission 

what be thy will 
false and unthankful and in that deserve 
all humane sorrow dare thou hope from i 
relief or comfort

their heavy anger thus I tender both 
the master of great Rome and in that lord 
of all the sun give heat and be to 
thus sue for mercy be but as thou be 
the pilot to the bark of my good fortune 
and once more steer my action to the port 
of glorious honour and if I fall off 
hereafter from my faith to this sweet virgin 
join with those power that punish perjury 
to make i a example to deter 
other from be false

to i but noble he make trial how 
I can endure unkindness I see truth 
triumphant in his sorrow dear aunt 
both credit he and help he and on assurance 
that what I plead for you can deny

I seal his pardon 

o that I ere look

I know thy wish and how much thou suffer 
in honour for thy friend thou shall repair all 
for to thy fleet I will give a foreright wind 
to pass the persian gulf remove all let 
that may molest thy soldier in their march 
that pass by land and destiny be false 
if thou prove not victorious yet remember 
when thou be raise up to the high point 
of humane happiness such as move beyond it 
must of necessity descend think on it 
and use those blessing that the god pour on you 
with moderation 

as their oracle 
I hear you and obey you and will follow 
your grave direction 

you will not repent it exeunt 

how do you like your entrance to the war 
when the whole body of the army move 
show it not glorious 

it be a fine maygame 
but eat and drink I think be forbid in it 
I mean with leisure we walk on and feed 
like hungry boy that haste to school or as 
we carry fish to the city dare stay nowhere 
for fear our ware shall stink 

that be the necessity 
of our speedy march 

sir I do love my ease 
and though I hate all seat of judicature 
I mean in the city for conveniency 
I still will be a justice in the war 
and ride upon my footcloth I hope a captain 
and a gownedcaptain too may be dispense with 
I tell you and do not mock i when I be poor 
I can endure like other cold and hunger 
but since I grow rich let but my finger ache 
or feel but the least pain in my great toe 
unless I have a doctor my own doctor 
that may assure i I be go 

Come fear not 
you shall want nothing 

we will make you fight 
as you be mad 

not too much of fight friend 
it be thy trade that be a common soldier 
we officer by our place may share the spoil 
and never sweat for it 

you shall kill for practice 
but your dozen or two a day 

thou talk as if 
thou be louse thyself but yet I will make danger 
if I prove one of the worthy so however 
I will have the fear of the god before my eye 
and do no hurt I warrant you 

Come march on 
and humour he for our mirth 

it be a fine peakgoose 

but one that fool to the emperor and in that 
a wise man and a soldier 

true morality exeunt 

now by the persian god most true welcome 
encompass thus with tributary king 
I entertain you lend your help hand 
to seat she by i and thus raise bow all 
to do she honour oh my best Cassana 
sister and partner of my life and empire 
we will teach thou to forget with present pleasure 
thy late captivity and this proud roman 
that use thou as a slave and do disdain 
a princely ransom shall if she repine 
be force by various torture to adore 
what she of late contemn 

all greatness ever 
attend Cosroe though Persia be style 
the nurse of pomp and pride we will leave to Rome 
her native cruelty for know Aurelia 
a roman princess and a Caesar sister 
though now like thou captive I can forget 
thy barbarous usage and though thou to i 
when I be in thy power do show thyself 
a most insult tyranness I to thou 
may prove a gentle mistress 

o my star 
a mistress can I love and owe that name 
to flesh and blood I be bear to command 
train up in sovereignty and I in death 
can quit the name of slave she that scorn life 
may mock captivity 

Rome will be Rome 
when we be nothing and her power the same 
which you once quake at 

Dioclesian live 
hear it and tremble life thou king of Persia 
the master of his fortune and his honour 
and though by devilish art we be surprise 
and make the prey of magic and of theft 
and not win noble we shall be redeem 
and by a roman war and every wrong 
we suffer here with interest be return 
on the insult doer 

sure these roman 
be more than man 

their great heart will not yield 
they can bend to any adverse fate 
such be their confidence 

they then shall break 
why you rebellious wretch dare you still 
contend when the least breath or nod of my 
mark you out for the fire or to be make 
the prey of wolf or vulture the vain name 
of Roman legion I slight thus and scorn 
and for that boast bugbear Dioclesian 
which you presume on will he be the master 
but of the spirit to meet i in the field 
he soon shall find that our immortal squadron 
that with full number ever be supply 
can it be possible they shall decay 
dare front his bold troop and scatter they 
as a high tower falcon on her stretch 
sever the fearful fowl and by the sun 
the moon the wind the nourisher of life 
and by this sword the instrument of death 
since that you fly not humble to our mercy 
but yet dare hope your liberty by force 
if Dioclesian dare not attempt 
to free you with his sword all slavery 
that cruelty can find out to make you wretched 
fall heavy on you 

if the sun keep his course 
and the earth can bear his soldier march I fear not 

or liberty or revenge 

on that I build too a trumpet 

a roman trumpet 

it be come it not like 
a pardon to a man condemn 

admit he enter Niger 
the purpose of thy come 

my great master 
the lord of Rome in that all power be speak 
hope that thou will prove a noble enemy 
and in thy bold resistance worth his conquest 
defy thou Cosroe 

there be fire in this 

and to encourage thy laborious power 
to tug for empire dare thou to the field 
with this assurance if thy sword can win he 
or force his legion with thy barb horse 
but to forsake their ground that not alone 
wing victory shall take stand on thy tent 
but all the province and kingdom hold 
by the roman garrison in this eastern world 
shall be deliver up and he himself 
acknowledge thou his sovereign in return 
of this large offer he ask only this 
that till the doubtful die of war determine 
who have most power and shall command the other 
thou will entreat thy prisoner like their birth 
and not their present fortune and to bring they 
guard into thy tent with thy best strength 
thy able man of war and thou thyself 
swear to make good the place and if he fail 
maugre all opposition can be make 
in his own person to compel his way 
and fetch they safe off the day be thou 
and he like these thy prisoner 

though I receive this 
but as a roman brave I do embrace it 
and love the sender tell he I will bring 
my prisoner to the field and without odds 
against his single force alone defend they 
or else with equal number courage noble prince 
and let posterity record that we 
this memorable day restore to Persia 
that empire of the world great Philip son 
ravish from we and Greece give up to Rome 
this our strong comfort that we can fall 
inglorious since we contend for all exeunt 

I will swear the peace against they I be hurt 
run for a surgeon or I faint

in Lombardy where the glad country strive 
with rural sport to give he entertainment 
with which delight he with ease forget 
all specious trifle and secure taste 
the certain pleasure of a private life 
but o ambition that eat into 
with venom tooth true thankfulness and honour 
and to support her greatness fashion fear 
doubt and prevention to decline all danger 
which in the place of safety prove her ruin 
all which be please to see in Maximinian 
to who his confer sovereignty be like 
a large sail fill full with a foreright wind 
that drown a small bark and he once fall 
into ingratitude make no stop in mischief 
but violent run on allow Maximinian all

confess you for my husband love and serve you 
if you contemn not these and think they curse 
I know no blessing that ambitious flesh 
can wish to feel beyond they 

Best Aurelia 
the parent and the nurse to all my glory 
it be not that thus embrace you I think 
there be a heaven beyond it that beget 
these sad retirement but the fear to lose 
what it be hell to part with better to have live 
poor and obscure and never scale the top 
of hilly empire than to die with fear 
to be throw headlong down almost as soon 
as we have reach it 

these be panic terror 
you fashion to yourself be not my brother 
your equal and copartner in the empire 
vow and confirm your friend the soldier constant 
have not your uncle Dioclesian take 
his last farewell of the world what then can shake you 

the thought I may be shake and assurance 
that what we do possess be not our own 
but have depend on another favour 
for nothing more uncertain my Aurelia 
then power that stand not on his proper basis 
but borrow his foundation I will make plain 
my cause of doubt and fear for what shall I 
conceal from you that be to be familiar 
with my most private thought be not the empire 
my uncle gift and may he not resume it 
upon the least distaste do not Charinus 
cross i in my design and what be majesty 
when it be divide do not the insolent soldier 
call my command his donative and what can take 
more from our honour no my wise Aurelia 
if I to you be more than all the world 
as sure you be to i as we desire 
to be secure we must be absolute 
and know no equal when your brother borrow 
the little splendour that he have from we 
and we be serve for fear not at entreaty 
we may live safe but till then we but walk 
with heavy burden on a sea of glass 
and our own weight will sink we 

your mother bring you 
into the world a emperor you persuade 
but what I will have counsel nearness of blood 
respect of piety and thankfulness 
and all the holy dream of virtuous fool 
must vanish into nothing when ambition

put in for empire on then and forget 
your simple uncle think he be the master 
in be once a emperor of a jewel 
who worth and use he know not for Charinus

thou masculine greatness to who soar spirit 
to touch the star seem but a easy flight 
oh how I glory in thou those great woman 
antiquity be proud of thou but name 
shall be no more remember but persevere 
and thou shall shine among those lesser light 
to all posterity like another Phebe 
and so adore as she be

his brow furrow with anger 

let he storm 
and you shall hear i thunder 

he dispose of 
my province at his pleasure and confer 
those honour that be only my to give 
upon his creature 

mighty sir ascribe it 
to his assurance of your love and favour 
and not to pride or malice 

no good Niger 
courtesy shall not fool i he shall know 
I lend a hand to raise he and defend he 
while he continue good but the same strength 
if pride make he usurp upon my right 
shall strike he to the centre you be well meet sir 

as you make the encounter sir I hear 
that you repine and hold yourself much grieve 
in that without your good leave I bestow 
the gallian proconsulship upon 
a follower of i

you dare attempt it 

dare Charinus 

dare 
again I speak it think you i so tame 
so leaden and unactive to sit down 
with such dishonour but recall your grant 
and speedy or by the Roman 
thou trip thy own heel up and have no part 
in Rome or in the empire 

thou have none

can sustain the weight it carry with it

thou have in a few day of thy short reign 
in overween pride riot and lust 
shame noble Dioclesian and his gift 
nor doubt I when it shall arrive unto 
his certain knowledge how the empire groan 
under thy tyranny but he will forsake 
his private life and once again resume 
his laidby majesty or at least make choice 
of such a Atlas as may bear this burden 
too heavy for thy shoulder to effect this 
lend your assistance gentleman and then doubt not 
but that this mushroom spring up in a night 
shall as soon wither and for you Aurelia

pay to your loathsome appetite as a fury 
fly from his loose embrace so farewell
