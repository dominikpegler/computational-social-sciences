of a little breath why do you tremble so 

Alas I know not what to answer this

that my poor honour be betray and I 
stand in your thought suspect of some guilt 
I never understand if the report 
of malice have abuse i to your ear 
for by yourself I be all innocent 

what do you mean Claudiana

my tender apprehension

and paleness that become not Claudiana

of the least scruple in myself or mean 
to discompose one cheerful look

poor question now you mean the english man 

the same most graceful in his part and person 

it be well I be satisfy and we both meet 
in one opinion too he be indeed 
the brave cavalier what hurt be in all 
this now I see you can distinguish be thou 
a virgin Claudiana thou will find 
gentle and easy thought to entertain 
so promise a servant I shall be 
take with he myself be I a lady 
and love a man 

how be this my fear return 

madam Bellaura the duke charge be enter 
the garden let we choose another walk 

why you be conceit sirrah do wit 
grow in this garden 

yea madam while I be in it I be a slip 
myself 

of rosemary or time 

of wit sweet madam 

it be pity but thou shall be keep with water 

there be wit in every flower if you can gather it 

I be of thy mind 
but what be the wit prithee of yonder tulip 

you may read there the wit of a young courtier 

what be that 

pride and show of colour a fair promise 
dear when it be buy and quick come to nothing 

the wit of that rose 

if you attempt 
madam to pluck a rose I shall find a moral in it 

no country wit 

that grow with potherb and poor root which here 
will be account weed course thing of profit 
who end be kitchen physic and sound health 
two thing not now in fashion 

your wit dance 
where learn you all these moral 

ay but glean 
from my young master Giovanni madam 
he will run division upon every flower 
he have a wit able to kill the weed 
and ripen all the fruit in the duke orchard 

where be Giovanni 

he go betimes to the academy 
he be at all the exercise we 
shall have such news when he come home 

why do 
your master be rich suffer his son 
to work in the garden 

my master he be a honest mortal man madam 
it be my mistress that command he to it 
a shrew and love he not but it be no matter 
I have the better company he be here 
I will leave he to you madam I must now 
water my plant 

why how now Giovanni you frequent I hear 
the academy 

when I can dispense 
madam with time and these employment I 
intrude a glad spectator at those school 
of wit and action which although I can 
reach I be willing to admire and look at 
with pity of myself lose here in darkness 

by this expression I may conceive 
how much you have improve and gain a language 
courtly and modest 

madam you be please 
to make my uneven frame of word your mirth 
I profess nothing but a humble ignorance 
and I repent not if by any way 
my duty and manner safe it may delight you 

Indeed Giovanni I be please but not 
with your suspicion that my praise be 
other then what become my ingenuous meaning 
for if I understand I like your language 
but with it I commend your modest spirit 

it be a honour madam much above 
my youth ambition but if I possess 
a part of any knowledge you have deign 
to allow it owe itself unto this school 

what school 

this garden madam it be my academy 
where gentleman and lady as yourself 
the first and fair dare I call you mistress 
enrich my ear and observation 
with harmony of language which at best 
I can but cold imitate 

still more courtly 
why how now Giovanni you will be 
professor short in the art of compliment 
you be best quit the garden and turn courtier 

madam I think upon the court with reverence 
my fate be to adore it afar off 
it be a glorious landscape which I look at 
as some man with narrow optic glass 
behold the star and wonder at their vast 
though unknown habitable world of brightness 
but be my eye a near judge and I 
admit to a clear knowledge madam 
of the court life there I may find the truth 
of man best idea and enjoy the happiness 
now only i by naked speculation 
I think how there I shall throw off my dust 
and rise a new creation 

the court 
be much behold to you Giovanni 

it be a duty madam I owe truth 

a truth in supposition all this while 

I shall be sad if any experience shall 
betray a error in my faith and yet 
so soft and innocent a trespass madam 
may well expect a pardon 

some that have 
free enjoy the pleasure or what else 
you so advance in court have at the last 
be weary and accuse their gay condition 
nay change their state for such a humble life 
as you profess a gardener 

I despise not 
what I be bear to madam but I shall 
imagine the disease lie in the mind 
not in the courtier that will throw away 
so spacious a blessing to be servile 

you know not Giovanni your own happiness 
nor the court sin the pride and surfeit there 
come not within your circle there be few 
pursue those noble tract your fancy aim at 
it be a dangerous sea to launch into 
both shelf and rock you see not ay and mermaid 

what be they madam 

you have hear of mermaid 

you mean not woman I hope madam 

yes 

o do not by so hard a application 
increase the poet torment that first make 
that fabulous story to disgrace your sex 
you be firm and the fair seal of the great maker 
a print next that of angel 

we be bind to thou 
if our cause want a flourish you have art 
to make we show fair 

and you be so 
it be malice dare traduce you or blind ignorance 
that throw her strain which fall off from your figure 
for those which weak understanding call 
your spot be ermine and can such as these 
darling of heaven and nature woman shoot 
at court a influence like unlucky planet 
they can sure why you live madam there 
that be enough to prove all praise a truth 
and by a sweet example make they all 
such as you be object of love and wonder 
o then how bless be they that live at court 
with freedom to converse with so much virtue 
as your fair sex embrace 

here be your mother 

Shee be too hasty 

madam I hope you will pardon my son rudeness 
to hold discourse with your ladyship 

it be a courtesy 
and he talk well to pass away the time 
exceed well but I must to my guardian 
the duke 

happiness attend your ladyship

where do sup 

I be not willing to engage myself 
abroad lest I may trespass on your patience 

what shall we do this evening 

walk a turn 
and then to a bona roba 

a match 

Giovanni 
thy spade and hold my cloak 

what be the device 

I have great mind to dig now do think I can 
handle a spade I will make a bed with my gentleman now 
for a hundred ducat 

it be a base employment 
fit for such a drudge as Giovanni 

sir 

a drudge I say do you scorn your little dunghill breed 

this be not noble 

how molecatcher 

forbear he be not arm 

you be best be his champion 

be you good at that 
I do not love to wear my doublet pink 

three against one 

hold 

I be no drudge you will find 
to be command sir you paint fly 
and only fit for trout 

let we give they play and breath 

lose our advantage be Thomazo flee 

and Bernardo we be best retire that Gardiner 
will stick i into ground else for a plant 

expect we will be revenge 

let we prevent they 

they be not worth it Giovanni so 
I hear you name 

my name be Giovanni 

thou have relieve and save my life I find 
their base conspiracy what shall I pay 
thy forward rescue 

it be but what I owe 
to justice with the expense of blood and life 
to prevent treachery reward I have 
receive in the act if I have do you service 
but it be your innocence that make such haste 
to your own valour not my sword preserve you 
I be young and never teach to fight 

I prithee 
accept this trifle buy a sword and wear it 
thou have deserve to thrive a noble way 
than thy condition show 

though some will call 
this bounty urge it not to my disgrace 
I scorn to sell the motion of my arm 
I fear you be not safe yet there may be 
danger in follow they and it grow dark 
have patience while I fetch a key that shall 
befriend you with a private way 

thou be noble 
though I be careless where the term of honour 
engage my life it be wisdom not to lose it 
upon their base revenge but I must study 
some other payment for this young man courage 
however his body suffer in a cloud 
his spirit be not obscure but brave and active 

if my intelligence fail not he must be 
here still this evening have put on a vizard 
to conspire with i there he walk surprise he 

villain coward slave my sword 

if you be loud we will strange you 

dispatch 

we have do sir be he for the river now 

no follow i 

these show like officer 
alas he be apprehend on their base 
complaint I can help thy cause and innocence 
must now befriend thou base world yet I may 
injure the part abroad it be only Venice 
be sick with these distemper then I will leave it 
and instant pursue some other fate 
in the war it may cure something too within i 
that be deny all remedy at home 
somebody for their physic be design 
to change of air I will try it upon my mind 

not this Englishman to be find 

he be not above ground 
where I can suspect he in the city 

let he go may be his haste topple he 
into the river and we may eat his nose 
in the next haddock 

wherefore do you fly 

do think it be fear 

it be something like a will 
to keep your skin from eyelethole 

I grant you 
what have I to do to bring up a fashion 

we may have go a sure and near way 
to have kill he in a right line with a bullet 
but let he go so he quit Venice any way 

he will spoil our mirth but I much wonder 
Bernardo be not come yet who I send 
ambassador for money to the merchant 

nor Marcello who I employ to the same end 
to my most costive uncle for some goldfinch 

why shall the state have a exchequer and 
we want 

for pious use too to drink their health 
and see the commonwealth go round 
in mutual commerce of mirth and spirit 
which phlegm and usury have almost stifle 
sobriety and long gown spoil the city 
it be we will keep the body politic 
from stink ulcer with long obligation 
and notary which now stuff the Rialto 
and poison honest nature that will else 
live free and be drink at their own charge 

I will make new law and I be duke of Venice 

we will not sit in the chimney corner then 
and sing like cricket 

we will roar like trumpet 
and deaf the senator with give we your money 

they give we our own their state their wife 
and wardrobe Scanderbag 

and their pretty daughter 
my valiant Turk who shall feed high of purpose 

to keep the wanton blood in titillation 

it shall be a law no maid shall be in fashion 

yes let they be in fashion but not hold 

not after fourteen be it then enact 

we will banish all the advocate that refuse 
to pimp and prove it civil law 

no scribe shall dare to show his ear in our dominion 

hang they they be label of the law and stink 
worse than a fishshamble in Lent no jew 
shall turn a christian upon peril of 
a confiscation 

why 

the slave be rich 
to turn they christian be to spoil their conscience 
and make they hide their money it be less evil 
in state to cherish Jew than christian usurer 

I will have every citizen a Jew then 

we have build no seraglio yet 

that be true 
what think you of the university 
will not they serve 

o excellent 
they have several school for several game 

and scaffold 
for the spectator when we keep our act 

the college rent will find the wench petticoat 
and the revenue of a score of abbey 
well strip will serve to roll they in clean linen 
and keep the toy in diet 

excellent 
but when we have convert to the use 
the monastery where shall we bestow 
the friar and the thin religious man 

you may 
keep they with little charge water be all 
the blessing their poor thirst require and tailor 
will be trouble for new clothes a hair shirt 
will outwear a copyhold and warm 4 life 
or if you think they troublesome it be 
a fair pretence to send they to some wild 
country to plant the faith and teach the infidel 
a way to heaven for which they may be burn 
or hang and there be a end of the honest man 
there be a thousand way to quiet they 

my admirable counsellor thou shall be 
my supreme officer to see justice do 

you can honour man of worth too much 

we will have the bridge all pull down and make 
of silver 

dross gold be our orient metal 
here be Benardo welcome where be the money 

not a gazet the merchant be all sullen 
and say you owe too much already 

these be dogbolt 
it be time we have new law and they will trust 

but we must build 
no golden bridge at this rate with sunbeam 

they be best content themselves with honest stone 
hard as the heart of your ungodly merchant 

prithee let we leave our dream of fright sailor 
and say what hope have thou of get money 
for this day mirth 

some hope there be if my uncle have but faith 
enough to credit what I never mean 
thrift and submission and holy matter 
it be all the way be leave to cozen he 
and creep into his nature I have pawn 
all my religion that I will turn friar 

have pawn thy religion much good do he 
let he take the forfeit so he send thou money 

for present use and howl and hang himself 
I care not o here be Marcello 
do speak with he 

yes 

that be well 

he do commend he to you and with it this 

I know it will take his tender conscience 

have thou prevail 

this halter he have tie the knot himself 
and say next the philosopher stone he know not 
what thing of noble value to present you 
and rather than you shall delay for want 
of a convenient you know what you shall 
once more peruse his orchard there be one tree 
he will have bear no other fruit 

I thank he 
for his fine noose will I have his neck in it 
the devil shall not conjure he from this circle 
be this the end of all 

no not of all 

I prithee try how it will hold do you hear 
let we lay our head together which of you 
be best acquaint with the Turk 

what Turk 

the great and mighty sultan the grand signior 
or have you but a christian correspondence 
with any of his heathen officer 

what to do 

no rogue that lie purdue here for intelligence 

what then 

I will make a bargain with he now and sell 
this city to the pagan instant 
Venice be a jewel a rich pendant 
will hang rare at the great Turk ear 

no doubt 

or at one horn of his half moon 

I think so 

I will betray if I know how the state 
or any thing for half a hundred ducat 
to make one merry night though after I 
be break upon a wheel or set upright 
to peep through a cleave tree like a polecat 
in the high way no money from the mongrel 
well if I live I will to Amsterdam 
and add another schism to the two hundred 
fourscore and odd 
I be resolve 

what 

to cry down all thing 
that hang on wit truth or religion 

Come thou be passionate be there no trick 
no lewd device let i see I have think 
away to raise we my dear Tully a project 
shall raise we or I will venture 

what 

my neck 
for hang be the end of my device 
unless I thrive in it go to the rendezvous 
to Rosabella on the grand Cavale 
kiss she and call for wine my bullyrook 
a dish of dainty fiddler to curvet too 
and drink a health that I may prosper tumble 
and shake the house I will fetch you off 

but signior

and leave i to the reckon I will return 
with indian spoil like Alexander

like a true macedonian we be go 
he be right and may in time and our good breed 
be bring to something may deserve the galley 
follow your leader Myrmidon 

we attend 

but will you venture signior Giovanni 
your body to the war indeed 

I mean so 

and leave i to be lose or throw away 
among the weed here 

try thy fortune with i 

yes and come hop home upon one leg 
will all my pay then buy a handsome halter 
to hang my arm in if it be but maim 
yet I endure a battle every day 
my mistress have a mouth carry whole cannon 
and if you take that engine to the war 
you will find it do rare service 

what 

her tongue 
make she but angry and you will need no more 
artillery to scour they with a breach 
what spoil her breath will make in a market place 

be less satirical 
I must not hear this she be my mother 

she be my mistress and that be worse but I be resolve 
I will to the war with you do not tell she on it 
my prenticeship be worse than kill there 
my hand I will with thou 

in the mean time buy you a sword and belt 
and what be fit 

no more I will be a soldier 
and kill accord to my pay this will 
suffice to vamp my body I may rise 
if I grow rich in valour that will do it 
money and a tilt feather make a captain 

there be no other way to quiet the 
affliction here beside it be honourable 
and war a glorious mistress 
it be Bellaura and my father 

I know madam you may break his resolution 
if you be please you may command he be here 

I will try my skill 

blessing attend your ladyship 
I will wait for the success 

how now Giovanni 
what with a sword you be not use to appear 
thus arm your weapon be a spade I take it 

it do become my late profession madam 
but I be change 

not to a soldier 

it be a title madam will much grace i 
and with the best collection of my thought 
I have ambition to the war 

you have 

o it be a brave profession and reward 
all loss we meet with double weight in glory 
a call prince still be proud to own 
and some do willing forget their crown 
to be command it be the spring of all 
we here entitle fame to emperor 
and all degree of honour owe all 
their name to this employment in her vast 
and circular embrace hold king 
and make they and yet so kind as not 
to exclude such private thing as I who may 
learn and commence in her great art my life 
have be too useless to myself and country 
it be time I shall employ it to deserve 
a name within their registry that bring 
the wealth the harvest home of well buy honour 

it be a active time I must confess 
and the unhappy scene of war too near we 
but that it shall inflame you on the sudden 
to leave a calm and secure life be more 
than common it work on man of your 
birth and condition beside I hear 
your father be not willing you shall leave he 
to engage yourself in such apparent danger 
here you will forfeit your obedience 
unless you stay 

I can despair madam 
of his consent and if by my own strength 
of reason I incline he not it be 
in my ambition to address my humble 
suit to your ladyship to gain it for i 
at worst it be no breach of duty madam 
if I prefer my country and her cause 
now bleed before any formal tie 
of nature to a soft indulgent father 
for danger let pale soul consider it 
it be beneath my fear 

yet I can see 
through all this resolution iovanni 
it be something else have wrought this violent change 
pray let i be of counsel with your thought 
and know the serious motive come be clear 
I be no enemy and can assist 
where I allow the cause 

you may be angry 
madam and chide it as a saucy pride 
in i to name or look at honour nor 
can I but know what small addition 
be my unskilful arm to aid a country 

I may therefore just suspect there be 
something of other force that move you to 
the war enlarge my knowledge with the secret 

at this command I open my heart madam 
I must confess there be another cause 
which I dare not in obedience 
obscure since you will call it forth and yet 
I know you will laugh at i 

it will ill 
become my breed Giovanni 

then 
know madam I be in love 

in love with who 

with one I dare not name she be so much 
above my birth and fortune 

I commend 
your flight but do she know it 

I dare never 
appear with so much boldness to discover 
my heart so great ambition it be here still 
a strange and busy guest 

and you think absence 
may cure this wound 

or death 

I may presume 
you think she be fair 

I dare as soon question your beauty madam 
the only ornament and star of Venice 
pardon the bold comparison yet there be 
something in you resemble my great mistress 
she blush 
such very beam disperse her bright eye 
powerful to restore decrepit nature 
but when she frown and change from her sweet 
aspect as in my fear I see you now 
offend at my boldness she do blast 
poor Giovanni thus and thus I wither 
at heart and wish myself a thing lose in 
my own forget dust but it be not possible 
at last if any star bless but high thought 
by some desert in war and deed of honour 
for mean as I have raise themselves to empire 
that she without a blush to stain her cheek 
may own i for a servant I be lose 
in wander apprehension 

poor Giovanni 
I pity thou but can cure I like 
thy aspire thought and to this last of love 
allow the war a noble remedy 
I have argue against your son resolve but find 
his reason overcome my weak dispute 
and I must counsel you to allow they too 

nay I be never much against it madam 

she love he not but do your ladyship 
think fit he shall go 

yes yes it be honourable 
and to encourage his forward spirit 
the general be my kinsman Giovanni 
what favour he can do you you shall have 
my letter to entreat and at my charge 
you shall be furnish like a gentleman 
attend i at my lodging 

you bind all 
my service why this will make a show yet 

nay then take my consent and blessing too 

and i the duke 

Bellaura I must speak to you 

I attend

how he bestow himself and what society 
withdraw he from his duty thus 

I shall 
with my best care 

I fear that Malipiero with Bellaura 
but let i find your diligence Bellaura 

I be all wonder shall I trust my sense 
a fair and pleasant gallery be I 
surprise for this or do I dream I do 
expect the end of my conveyance shall 
have be more fatal 
no tract appear or sign of those that bring i 
the place be rich in ornament sure these 
be picture all thing silent as the image 
and yet these speak some do inhabit here 
this room be not ordain only for air 
and shadow it be some flatter prologue to 
my death some plot to second the affront 
of Malipiero with more scorn to ruin i 
what art 

a friend 

that posture and presentment 
promise no great assurance yet there be something 
within that noble frame will tempt i to 
believe thou be 

what 

a black murderer 
point not thy horrid messenger of death 
upon a man disarm my bosom be 
no proof against those fiery executioner 
How come I to deserve from thou unknown 
so black a purpose as thy look present i 
I never see thy face nor be I conscious 
of any act in who revenge thou have 
put on this horror let i know my guilt 
before I die although I never live 
at that poor rate to fear a noble death 
yet unprepared and thus to die do something 
stagger my soul and weaken my resolve 
to meet thy execution thou have 
too good a face to be a mercenary 
cutthroat and Malipiero will become 
the hangman office better 

you believe then 
how easy I can command your destiny 
I have no plot with any Malipiero 
and thus remove thy fear 

be he go 

you be still within 
my power but call yourself my guest not prisoner 
and if you be not dangerous to yourself 
nothing be mean but safety here and honour 

this do amaze i more but do italian 
compel man to receive their courtesy 

I must not give you reason yet for your 
surprise you may receive a timely knowledge 
and not repent I be a gentleman 
and by that name secure thou if you can 
fancy a peace with this restraint it be none 
but something that may please you above freedom 
if your unruly thought tempt a resistance 
death be let in at every thing you look at 

I will leave my wonder and believe what now 
must I obey 

first walk away your fright

but pray tell i 
of these which some have praise for handsomeness 
which do affect you most I guess you have 
by frequent view and the converse with lady 
arrive at excellent judgement

expect this dialogue yet I will be free 
I profess stranger to they all but this point to Claudiana 
I shall elect the fair and most worthy 
a masculine embrace I build upon 
the promise of your honour I shall else 
be nice in my opinion 

you be just 
and I prefer that too what will you say 
to call that lady mistress and enjoy she

and noble satisfaction

I must be clear thou must embrace another 
another in my bed who from the world 
I have make choice to know thou be not fright 
this way be leave and this alone to recompense 
my want and make both happy

who secrecy I will trust but not another 
beside the principal agent to get heaven 

you be no italian sure

cancel his faith rather than be a strict 
idolater of word and severe law 
to the destroy of so sweet a figure 
I will not have thou fly like bird in the air 
or ship that leave no tract to say here be 
so rich a blessing rather like a plant

that have overcome all nice consider 
to do thou justice nor will I intrude

to raise thy free consent my Claudiana 
it be he who thou do think worth thy own praise 
the gentleman victorious for his part 
so late in Venice the english cavalier 

I be undo 

to be short 
I have surprise his person for this use 
he have be many day a obscure guest 
within the lodging next the garden for 
I must confess I have have struggle in 
my nature and have sit in council against 
myself sometime touch this great affair 
but I have answer every thing oppose it 
and take this time to acquaint thou 

good sir kill i 

I will 
and he too if you mingle not and make 
the project as I cast it be not obstinate 
why he shall never discover who thou act 
if thou be faithful to thyself thou may 
pretend thyself some pleasant bona roba 
doctor take what name and shape thou will 

there be none 
can hide my shame or wash the stain away 

what shame or stain be in it when it be keep 
a secret dark than the book of destiny 
from mankind 

be I practise in those art 
of sin that he shall take i for a courtesan 
nay rather let i be know your wife 
it will oblige he more to use i well 
and thank your love pain that bring i to he 
if I must be a whore and you a 

stay and I a what I bleed within i 

this key will make the chamber free I follow 
Consider sir I be else undo for ever 

why if he know i for her husband it be 
without a name I can secure my honour 
and send he quick to eternal silence 
I be resolve they must obey proceed 
a little blood will wash away this deed 

our city droop with the wound so late 
receive be now to study with what joy 
to entertain so great a victory 
Treviso be return to our obedience 
almost without a loss how many fall 
on the adverse part those paper signify 
and must enlarge our triumph but be it not 
strange what our general write of Giovanni 
who spirit he admire and forward valour 
refer to his bold attempt our conquest 
that he advance his head and sword first on 
the enemy wall which inflame our army 
to second he with courage and that after 
with his own hand he slay their general 
who fall shoot death and tremble through their army 

where be Giovanni 

he be by direction of our general 
now march hither to his only conduct 
the captive be remit and his act 
by we to be consider but we have 
send order for the place of his prisoner 
secure and command he shall here 
attend our pleasure 

the young gardener 

the same who early valour take away 
the prejudice of humble birth and ought 
to be encourage noble 

it be but justice 
be it possible the gardiner son shall so 
behave himself in war 
he will deserve some honour for it 

why may not 
our power dispense and though his low condition 
by our rule exempt he for his gallant service 
do now create he gentleman of Venice 
with a noble pension from our treasury 
to bear his title up 

we give it stranger 
who birth we not examine 
he deserve it 

let he receive no favour 
for his relation to i but take 
his place and punishment with the rest away 
I cast he from my thought 

why come not 
our general himself 

reason of war 
may yet compel his stay he be to repair 
some breach which our soldier make and wise 
by some new fortification secure 
the town if the enemy shall reinforce 

signior Giovanni wait 

have he dispose 
by our direction those prisoner be 
send by our general 

he have and please your excellency 

admit he 

all health and honour to the duke and senate 

we thank thou Giovanni and will spare 
your trouble to relate what we have gain 
in the war our general write how much our Venice 
do owe to you who maiden yet bold valour 
have wrought our safety and suppress the late 
insolent genoese 

your bounty make 
that i which I want merit sir to challenge 
but if my will to serve my country for 
beside that name and warm desire I dare 
call nothing i you be please to accept and cherish 
a young man duty you will teach i in 
the next employment to deserve indeed 
till when you lose not to have build upon 
this humble pile a monument of your goodness 
to tell the world although misplace on i 
you love a grow virtue 

This Giovanni 
his word taste more of courtier than the garden 
to show we understand and to that knowledge 
have will to recompense the desert Giovanni 
the senate bid you ask what in your power 
your thought can aim at to reward your service 
and you shall soon possess it 

ask ask quick 
a hundred thousand double double ducat 
it will serve we both do it beggar must be impudent 

now you destroy what else may live to serve you 
this grace will make i nothing when I call 
my airy worth to balance keep those glorious 
reward for man bear and bring up in honour 
that may be great and able column to 
your ever envy state alas I rise 
like a thin reed beneath this commonwealth 
who weight a Atlas must sustain like heaven 
this favour be too mighty and if you 
command i ask a just reward it be nothing 

you have as good have say nothing I blush for you 
you know many soldier 
so modest to refuse pay or preferment 
they can have it sometime after many 
petition to the state and now their mind 
be soluble and apt to pour out favour 
you to be so maidenly 

may I credit 
with pardon of your wisdom that you mean 
to encourage thus the low bear Giovanni 

now he make question of their honesty too 
o simple soldier 

we look not at thy root but at thy blossom 
and as a preserver of our country 
we offer up a gratitude consult 
with thy best judgement though beside this act 
of he abroad I can give no account aside 
why I shall love this young man or prefer he 
I know not by what mystery I have 
have thought to wish he more than common fortune 
and this occasion of his merit offer 
I will pursue 

do as I counsel you and remember I 
have leave my fortune and my trade to serve you 

call it not pride if I be willing to 
believe your excellence that I have do 
something your goodness prompt you to reward 
and the grave senate I have think 

be free 

now do I expect to be half a senator at least 

and since you raise my act to such a merit 
I will not ask a thing too much beneath it 

Well say vannij 

and shame your bounty yet I may fear 
you will not grant 

again 

name it with confidence 

I look at no reward of gold 

how be that he be out on his part 

I know not 
by what fate I contemn it nor at title 
of honour or command or what can trench 
on state or wealth 

I thank you hearty 
I must to dig again 

employ such gift 
to pay some slight and mercenary soul 
that make their end of good reward and not 
itself but since you have impose I shall 
make choice of somewhat know my ambition aim 

at what 

it be too great a happiness but I now 
consider I have prattle to the wind 
what I desire be not within your power 
and what you may command not in my wish 
for I will ask Bellaura can you make 
i fit for such a blessing no you can 
unless I be unborn and shall again 
come forth not Giovanni but the son 
of some bright name and this worldtaking honour

and scapular you wear not only hear i 
but use your pious art to save from ruin 
a man condemn for that which heaven and you 
call virtue for not do a black deed 
will damn three soul at once and if your power 
can prevail for mercy to my life 
I challenge you when I be dead to be

shall have be stain in his distrust of heaven 
to bless he with a heir and her white treasure 
by i a stranger rifle have not providence 
chain up our blood so that the hour he give 
to serve his black ambition and our lust 
we only spend in prayer for his conversion

This yet he know not and it be not safe 
to appear in our own virtue since the justice 
we do our peace in cross his expectance 
may improve his rage to both our ruin this 
sad story fright you there be horror in it 
but it be a hour the last without some miracle 
to rescue i a man disarm from violence 
nor dare I mock heaven now or hang upon 
my soul the burden of a lie when it be 
take her last eternal flight it be not 
a fear to die afflict i with my faith 
and innocence about i I have look 
death in the face and be it think no boast 
to say I have teach other by example 
to march up to the ugly face of danger 
but to die thus dishonourble to be 
send out of the world in the dark without a name 
or any account to those to who I owe 
my blood and birth person that carry name 
of honour in my country this do stagger i 
to quit my life and may excuse my address 
to you who have authority from heaven 
to take his fury off who otherwise 
I expect my violent executioner 
I have some tremble for his lady who 
most holy tear stream through my soul compassion 
and charm my blood tear if he dare have patience 
be powerful enough to beg from heaven 
that blessing which he fond think to hasten 
with loss of his eternity
