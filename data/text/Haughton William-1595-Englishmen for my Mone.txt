how smug this grayeyed morning seem to be 
a pleasant sight but yet more pleasure have I 
to think upon this moisten southwest wind 
that drive my laden ship from fertile Spain 
but come what will no wind can come amiss 
for two and thirty wind that rule the sea 
and blow about this airy region 
thirty two ship have I to equal they 
who wealthy fraught do make Pisaro rich 
thus every soil to i be natural 
indeed by birth I be a Portugal 
who drive by western wind on english shore 
here like of the soil I marry 
and have three daughter but impartial death 
long since deprive i of her dear life 
since who disease in London I have dwell 
and by the sweet loud trade of usury 
let for interest and on mortgage 
do I wax rich though many gentleman 
by my extortion come to misery 
among the rest three english gentleman 
have pawn to i their live and their land 
each several hope though their hope be vain 
by marriage of my daughter to possess 
their patrimony and their land again 
but gold be sweet and they deceive themselves 
for though I guild my temple with a smile 
it be but judaslike to work their end 
but soft what noise of footing do I hear 

now master what intend you to read to we 

Pisaro your father will have i read moral philosophy 

what be that 

first tell i how you like it 

first tell we what it be 

they be my daughter and their schoolmaster Pisaro not a word but list their talk 

gentlewoman to paint philosophy 
be to present youth with so sour a dish 
as their abhor stomach will digest 
when first my mother Oxford England pride 
foster i pupillike with her rich store 
my study be to read philosophy 
but since my headstrong youth unbridle will 
scorn the leaden fetter of restraint 
have prune my feather to a high pitch 
gentlewoman moral philosophy be a kind of art 
the most contrary to your tender sex 
it teach to be grave and on that brow 
where beauty in her rare glory shine 
plant the sad semblance of decay age 
those weed that with their riches shall adorn 
and grace fair nature curious workmanship 
must be convert to a black face veil 
grief livery and sorrow semblance 
your food must be your heart abundant sigh 
steep in the brinish liquor of your tear 
daylight as darknight darknight spend in prayer 
thought your companion and repentant mind 
the recreation of your tire spirit 
gentlewoman if you can like this modesty 
then will I read to you philosophy 

not I 

fie upon it 

hang up philosophy I will none of it 

a tutor say I a tutor for the devil 

no gentlewoman Anthony have learn 
to read a lector of more please worth 
Marina read these line young Harvey send they 
there every line repugn philosophy 
then love he for he hate the thing thou hate 
Laurentia this be thou from Ferdinand 
think every golden circle that thou se 
the rich unvalued circle of his worth 
Mathea with these glove thy Ned salute thou 
as often as these hide these from the sun 
and wanton steal a kiss from thy fair hand 
present his serviceable true heart zeal 
which wait upon the censure of thy doom 
what though their land be mortgage to your father 
yet may your dowry redeem that debt 
think they be gentleman and think they love 
and be that thought their true love advocate 
say you shall wed for wealth for to that scope 
your father greedy disposition tend 
the world will say that you be have for wealth 
and so fair beauty honour quite distinct 
a mass of wealth be pour upon another 
little augment the show although the sum 
but be light scatter by itself 
it double what it seem although but one 
even so yourselves for wed to the rich 
his style be as it be a rich man still 
but wed these to wed true love be duty 
you make they rich in wealth but more in beauty 
I need not plead that smile that smile show heart consent 
that kiss show love that on that gift be lend 
and last thy eye that tear of true joy send 
as comfortable tiding for my friend 

have do have do what need thou more procure 
when long ere this I stoop to that fair lure 
thy ever love Harvey I delight it 
Marina ever love shall requite it young 
teach we philosophy I will be no nun 
age scorn delight I love it be 
there be not a word of this not a word part 
but shall be stamp seal print on my heart 
on this I will read on this my sense ply 
all art be vain but this philosophy 

why be I make a maid but for a man 
and why Laurentia but for Ferdinand 
the chaste soul these angel can entice 
much more himself a angel of more price 
be it thyself present as my heart can wish 
such usage thou shall have as I give this 

then you will kiss he 

if I do how then 

nay I say nothing to it but amen 

the clerk must have his fee I will pay you they 

good God how abject be this single life 
I will not abide it father friend nor kin 
shall once dissuade i from affect 
a man be a man and Ned be more than one 
in faith I will have thou Ned or I will have none 
do what they can chafe chide or storm their fill 
Mathea be resolve to have her will 

I can no long hold my patience 
impudent villainy and lascivious girl 
I have overhear your vild conversion 
you scorn philosophy you will be no nun 
you must needs kiss the purse because he send it 
and you forsooth you flurgill minion 
a brat scant fold in the dozen at most 
you will have your will forsooth what will you have 

but twelve year old nay father that be not so
