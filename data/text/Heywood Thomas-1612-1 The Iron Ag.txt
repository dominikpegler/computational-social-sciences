sceptre and crown say she will make i rich 
next step forth Pallas with a golden book 
say reach it i I will teach the literature

next smile Venus come with such a look 
able to ravish mankind thus bespeak i 
make that ball i the fair queen that breathe 
I will in requital cast into thy arm 
how can I stand against her golden smile 
when beauty promise beauty she prevail 
to she I give the prize with which she mount 
like to a star from earth shoot up to heaven 
now if in Greece as some report be lady 
peerless for beauty wherefore may not Paris 
by Venus aid sail hence to Grecia 
and quit the rape of fair Hesione 
by steal thence the queen most beautiful 
that feed upon the honey of that air 

that amorous goddess bear upon the wave 
assist thou in thy voyage we will rig 
a royal fleet to waft thou into Greece 
Aeneas with our son Deiphobus 
and other lord shall bear thou company 
what think our son Hector and Troilus 
of Paris expedition 

as a attempt the heaven have cause to prosper 
go brother Paris if thou bring a queen 
Hector will be her champion then let we see 
what greek dare fetch she hence 

straight give order 
to have his fleet make ready 

stay Priam Paris cease stay trojan peer 
to plot your universal overthrow 
what have poor Troy deserve that you shall kindle 
flame to destroy it 

what intend Cassandra 

to quench bright burn Troy to secure thou 
to save old Priam and his fifty son 
the royal issue that ever king I enjoy 
to keep the reverent hair of Hecuba 
from be tear off by her own sad hand 

Cassandra mad

so let our aunt 
be still a slave in Greece and we your son

at this bright bonfire dream not Hecuba 
the night before this fatal youth be bear 
that she bring forth a firebrand 

it be most true 

and when king Priam to the priest reveal 
this ominous dream he with the god consult 
and from the oracle do this return 
that the child bear shall stately illion burn 

and well the prophet guest for my desire 
to visit Greece burn with a quenchless fire

Helen have well advise and for the best

and who will fear for such a royal wife 
to set the universal world at strife 
bright Helen name shall live and never have end 
when all the world about you shall contend 

be as be may since we be go thus far 
proceed we will in spite of threaten war 
hazard and dread both these we nothing hold 
so long as Paris we may thus enfold 

my father mother brother sister all 
Illium and Troy in pomp majestical 
shall solemnize our nuptial let that day 
in which we espouse the beauteous Helena 
be hold a holiday a day of joy 
for ever in the calendar of Troy 

it shall be so we have already send 
our high priest Calchas to the oracle 
at Delphos to return we the success 
and a true notice of our future war 
while we expect his come be it our care 
the spartan second nuptial to prepare 

thou glory of the greek the great commander 
of the stout Myrmidon welcome from Delphos 
what speak the oracle the sack of Troy 
or the greek ruin say shall we be victor 
or Priam triumph in our overthrow 

the god of Delphos send you joyful news 
Troy shall be sack and we be conqueror 
upon your helm wear triple spangle plume 
let all the loud instrument of war 
with stern alarm rouse the monster death 
and march we bold to the wall of Troy 
Troy shall be sack and we be conqueror 

thank for thy news Achilles by that honour 
my father win upon the wall of Troy 
my warlike father Aiax Telamon 
I will not for the world Priam shall send 
incestuous Helen back on term of peace 
May smooth Ulysses and bold Diomedes 
who you have send on your late embassy 
be welcome as Antenor be to Greece 
scorn and revile since the oracle have say 
Troy shall be sack and we be conqueror 

king Agamemnon here be a trojan priest 
be send by Priam to the oracle 
the reverent man I welcome and entreat 
the general with these prince do the like 

welcome to Agamemnon reverent Calchas 

to Menelaus welcome 

to Aiax welcome father can thou fight 
as well as pray if we shall want for man 

by prayer I use to fight and by my counsel 
give aid to arm 

such as be past arm father Calchas still 
say counsel good but give i strength at will 
when you with all your counsel in the field 
meet Hector with his strength tell i who will yield 

the strong build wall of stately Tenedos 
we have level with the earth it now remain 
we march along unto the wall of Troy 
and thunder vengeance in king Priam ear 
have we once answer of our embassy 

I ever hold such embassy as base 
the restitution of our ravish queen 
on term of parley bar our stern revenge 
and end our war ere full it begin 
king Agamemnon no Aiax say not 
who sword as thirsty as the parch earth 
shall never ride in peace upon his thigh 
while in the town of Troy there breathe a soul 
that give consent unto the spartan rape 
march march and let the thunder of our drum 
strike terror to the city Pergamus 

the son of Telamonius speak honourable 
we have bring a thousand ship to Tenedos 
and every ship full fraught with man at arm 
and all these arm man with fiery spirit 
swear to revenge king Menelaus wrong 
and burn skykissing Islium to the ground 
therefore strike up war instrument on high 
and march unto the town courageous 

prince what answer touch Helena 

what answer but dishonourable term 
contempt and scorn perch on their leader brow 
by jove I think they will have slay we both 
if ever Helen be redeem from thence 
but by the sack of Troy say Diomedes 
be no true soldier 

Even in the king 
there do appear such high majestic scorn 
of threaten ruin that I think himself 
will put on arm and meet we in the field 
we linger time great Agamemnon march 
that we may buckle with the pride of Troy 

Priam so insolent his son so brave 
to entertain so great ambassador 
with such ungentle usage 

they have a knight call Hector on who valour 
they build their proud defiance if I meet he 
now by the azure arm of that bright goddess 
from who I be descend with my sword 
I will lop that limb off and enforce their pride 
fall at Achilles foot Hector and I 
must nor both shine at once in war bright sky 

when they both meet the great dim the less 
great general march Aiax endure not word 
so well as blow in a field glaze with sword 

Calchas a traitor 

and among the greek 

base runagate wretch when we their tent surprise 
as Hector live the traitorous prophet die 

let not remembrance of so base a wretch 
make we forget our safety the argive king 
be land and this day race Tenedos 
and bid we battle on Scamander plain 

who we will give a brave and proud affront 
shall we not brother Hector 

Troilus yes 
and beat a fire out of their burgonet 
shall like a earthy comet blaze towards heaven 
there grow a fix star in the firmament 
to emblaze our last glory hark their drum 
let our drum give they parlance 

be there among your troop a felon prince 
call by the name of Paris 

be there among your troop a knight so bold 
dare meet that Paris single in the field 
and call he felon 

or insult greek 
be there one Telamonius dare set his foot 
to Paris here he stand and hand to hand 
maintain the wrong do to Hesione 
as Paris shall the rape of Helena 

know here be one call Aiax Telamonius 
behold he well son to that Telamonius 
thou fain will see and he dare set his foot 
to Paris or thyself

of such a knight call by the name of Hector 
if thou be he who sword have conquer kingdom 
Pannonia Illyria and Samothrace 
and to thy father empire add they 
Achilles as a friend will thou to sheathe 
thy warlike sword retire from Troy defence 
and spare thy precious life I will not have 
a knight so fame meet a untimely grave 

I meet thou in that honourable love 
and for thy own sake wish thou safe aboard 
for if thou stay thou son of Peleus 
I will have thou know thy fame be not thy own 
but all engross for i not all thy guard 
of warlike Myrmidon can wall it safe 
from mighty Hector 

shame you not great lord

thy love in Hector soul it do i good 
to see two greekish knight fall in their blood 
under thy manly arm 

my blow be touch 
unto these ponderous stroke great Hector give 
o that this general quarrel may be end 
in equal opposition you and I 
against the two most valiant

of man on both side slay you see my sword 
glaze in the sanguine moisture of your friend 
I call the son of Saturn for a witness 
to Hector word I have not meet one grecian 
be able to withstand i my strong spirit 
will fain be equal be there in your troop 
a knight who breast include so much of valour 
to meet with Hector in a single war 
by jove I think there be not if there be 
to he I make this proffer if the god 
shall grant to he the honour of the day 
and I be slay his be my honour be mes 
to hang for a eternal monument 
of his great valour but my mangle body 
send back to Troy to a red funeral pile 
but if he fall the armour which he wear 
I will lodge as trophy on Apollo shrine 
and yield his body to have funeral right 
and a fair monument so near the sea 
that merchant fly in their sailwinged ship 
near to the shore in after time may say 
there lie the man Hector of Troy do slay 
and there be my gauntlet to make good my challenge 

will none take up his gage shall this proud challenge 
be entertain by none I know you all 
shame to deny yet fear to undertake it 
the cause be i and i shall be the honour 
to combat Hector 

Menelaus pause 
be not Achilles here stern Aiax here 
and kingly Diomedes how will they scorn 
that stand upon the honour of their strength 
shall you prevent they of this glorious combat 

by jove I think they dare as well take up 
a poisonous serpent as great Hector gage 

yes trojan se thou not Aeacides 
dart emulous look on kingly Diomedes 
lest he shall stoop to take his gauntlet up 
and see how Diomedes eye warlike Aiax 
Aiax Ulysses every one inflame 
to answer Hector 

be there any here 
dare stoop while great Achilles be in place 

I dare 

and so dare I 

you be all too weak 
to encounter with the mighty Hector arm 
this combat sole do belong to i 

then wherefore do not thou take up the gauntlet 

to see if thou or any bold greek 
dare be so insolent to touch the same 
and bar i of the honour of the combat 

by all the god I dare 

and all the devil 
I will lop his hand off that dare touch the gage 

pray leave this emulous fury Agamemnon 
to end this difference and provide a champion 
to answer Hector honourable challenge 
of nine the most repute valiant 
let several lot be cast into a helm 
among they all one prize he to who fortune 
shall give the honour let he straight be arm

to breathe a while and put his armour on

and our bold champion arm but a brave herald 
shall give you warning by the trumpet sound 
till when we will retire unto our tent 
as you unto the town

among king Priam son the weak of fifty 
will in the heat of flame or mouth of hell 
answer the challenge of so brave a king 

greek to your tent to put armour on 
make haste I long to know my champion 

here from the wall of Troy my reverent queen 
and beauteous Helen we will stay to see 
the warlike combat betwixt our valiant son 
and the greek champion young Astyanax 
pray that thy father may have victory 

why shall you doubt his fortune who strong arm 
unhorse a thousand knight all in one day 
and think you any one among the greek 
be able to encounter with his strength 

but howsoever child unto the pleasure 
of the high god we must refer the combat 

my royal father Hector in his arm 
send for your blessing with the queen my mother 
and crave your prayer to the all powerful god

which who so fight for be secure from harm 

None press too near the champion

now greek let i behold my champion 

it be I thy cousin Aiax Telamonius 

and cousin by jove thou have a brave aspect 
it cheer my blood to look on such a foe 
I will there run none of our trojan blood 
inall thy vein or that it be divide 
from that which thou receive from Telamonius 
be I assure our blood possess one side 
and that the other by olympic jove 
I will thrill my javelin at the grecian moisture 
and spare the trojan blood Aiax I love it 
too dear to shed it I can rather wish 
Achilles the half god of your huge army 
have be my opposite 

he keep his tent 
in mournful passion that he miss the combat 
but Hector I shall give thou cause to say 
there be in the greekish host a knight a prince 
as lion heart and as giant strong 
as Thetis son behold my warlike target 
of ponderous brass quilt with seven ox hide 
impenetrable and so full of weight 
that scarce a grecian sane myself can lift it 
yet can I use it like a summer fan 
make of the stately train of juno bird 
my sword will bite the hard adamant 
I will with my javelin cleave a rock of marble 
therefore though great Achilles be not here 
think not brave cousin Hector but to find 
Achilles equal both in strength and mind 

hold you have both shed blood too dear to lose 
in single opposition 

be your champion 
my cousin Aiax willing to leave combat 
will he first give the word 

sir Paris no 
it be Hector challenge and it be Hector office 
if we surcease on equal term of valour 
to give the word 

then here be thy cousin hand 
by jove thou have a lusty ponderous arm 
thus till we meet again let we part both friend 
for proof whereof Aiax we will interchange 
somewhat betwixt we for alliance sake 
here take this sword and target trust the blade 
it never deceive his master 

take of i 
this purple stud belt I win it cousin 
from the most valiant prince of Samothrace 
and wear it for my sake 

Priam unto the greekish general 
this proffer make because these bloodstained field 
be overspread with slaughter to take truce 
till all the dead on both side be inter 
which if you grant he here invite the general 
his nephew Aiax and the great Achilles 
with twenty of your chief select prince 
to banquet with he in his royal palace 
those revel end then to arm again 

a truce for bury of the slaughter body 
we yield unto but for our safe return 
from Troy and you what pledge have you find

for Priam pledge king Agamemnon take 
my faith and honour which if Priam break 
I will break the heart of Troy

brave time rare change from fight now to feast 
so many heavy blade to fly in piece 
for such a piece of light flesh what be the reason 
a lass of my complexion and this feature 
may have be rapt and steal again by Paris 
and none of all this stir for it but I perceive 
now all the world be turn wencher and in time 
all wench will turn witch but these trumpet 
proclaim their interview 

see here be the picture of a politic state 
they all embrace and hug yet deadly hate 
they say their be brave lass in this Troy 
what if Thersites spruce smuge himself 
and strive to hide his hunchback no not I 
it be hold a rule who nature mark in show 
and most deform they be best arm below 
I will not conceal my virtue yet shall I venture 
to dam myself for paint fan my face 
with a dye ostrich plume plaster my wrinkle 
with some old lady trowel I may pass 
perhaps for some maidmarian and some wench 
want good eyesight may perhaps mistake i 
for a spruce courtier courtier tush I from 
my first discretion have abhor that name 
still suit my condition with my shape 
and do and will and can when all else fail 
though neither sooth nor speak well brave rail 
and that be Thersites humour 

after so much hostility in steel 
all welcome to this peaceful entertain 

Priam we know thou to be honourable 
although our foe treason be to be fear 
in peasant not in prince 

ay so now sit a trojan and a greek

that make you so renown spring from Hesione

he say it be his lance dismount Troilus 
and not the stumble on the breathless course 
of one new slay that fell i

to boast on and send word to Cressida

Troilus nor all the trojan in the field 
can make their sword bite on Achilles shield 
it be none but Hector must revenge his death 

but not this day 

before the sun decline 
that terror of the earth I will make divine 

thus fly the dust before the northern wind 
and turn to atom dance in the air 
so from the force of our victorious arm 
fly arm squadron of the bold greek 
and mate at the terror of our name 
so clear the field before i no man favour 
the blood of three brave prince in my rage 
I have sacrifice to Margareton soul 
Aiax Oilaeus Aiax Telamonius 
Meriones Menelaus Idomeneus 
archduke and king have shrink beneath this arm 
beside a thousand knight have fall this day 
beneath the fury of my ponderous blow 
and not the least of my victorious spoil 
quiver my javelin through the brawny thigh 
of strong Achilles and I seek he still 
once more to tug with he my sword and breath 
assist i still till one drop down in death 

Come cast yourselves into a ring of terror 
about this warlike prince by who I bleed 

what mean the glory of the grecian host 
thus to besiege i with his Myrmidon 
and keep aloof himself 

that shall my lance 
in bloody letter text upon thy breast 
for young pagtroclus death for my dishonour 
for thousand spoil and for that infinite wrack 
our army have endure only by thou 
thy life must yield i satisfaction 

my life and welcome by Apollo fire 
I never venture blood with more content 
then against thou Achilles come prepare 

for eminent death you of my warlike guard 
my Myrmidon for slaughter most renown 
now swear to my designment your steel poleaxe 
fix all at once and gird he round with wound 

dishonourable greek Hector never deal 
on base advantage or ever life his sword 
over a quake foe but as a spoil 
unworthy we still leave he to his fear 
not on the man who single I strike down 
have I redouble blow my valour still 
oppose against a stand enemy 
thou have I twice unhorse and when I may 
have slay thou grovel leave thou to the field 
thy armour and thy shield impenetrable 
wrought by the god of Lemnos in his forge 
by art divine with the whole world engrave 
I have through pierce and still it wear my scar 
forget not how last day even in thy tent 
I feast my good sword and may have fling 
my ball of wildfire round about your fleet 
to have send up your greekish pride in flame 
which will have fix a star in that high orb 
to memorize to all succeed time 
our glory and your shame yet this I spare 
and shall I now be slay by treachery 

tell he your answer on your weapon point 
upon he my brave soldier 

come you slave 
before I fall I will make some food forgiaves 
that gape to swallow coward cease you dog 
upon a lion with your arm fang 
and bear i brave where I touch I kill 
and where I fasten rear body from soul 
and soul from hope of rest all Greece shall know 
blood must run waste in Hector overthrow 

farewell the noble spirit that ere breathe 
in any terrene mansion take up his body 
and bear it to my tent I will straight to horse 
and at his fetlock to my great glory 
I will drag his mangle trunk that grecian all 
may deaf the world with shout at Hector fall 

black fate black day be never calendar 
hereafter in the number of the year 
the planet cease to work the sphere to move 
the sun in his meridian course to shine 
perpetual darkness overwhelm the day 
in which be fall the pride of Asia 

rot may that hand 
and every joint drop piecemeal from his arm 
that take such base advantage on a worthy 
who all advantage scorn 

yet though his life they have base take away 
his body we have rescue maugre Greece 
and Paris I the mean of Priam son 
have make as many Myrmidon weep blood 
as have least finger in the worthy fall 

what but his death can thus have arm my hand 
or drown decrepit Priam to the field 
that star be shoot his luster quite eclipse 
and shall we now surrender Helena 

not till Achilles lie as dead as Hector 
and Aiax by Achilles not while Islium 
have one stone rear upon another back 
to overlook these wall or these high wall 
to overpeer the plain 

contrary element 
the war meteor hell and Elizium 
be not so much oppose as Troy and Greece 
for Hector Hector death 

a most sad funeral 
will his in Troy be where shall scarce a eye 
of twice two hundred thousand be find dry 
these obets once pass over which we desire 
those eye that now shed water shall speak fire 

now sound retreat 

we back to Troy return 
where every soul in funeral black shall mourn 

Hector be dead and yet my brother Troilus 
a second terror to the greek still live 
in he there be hope since all his Myrmidon 
have feel his fury fly even at his name 
but must the proud Achilles still insult 
and triumph in the glory of base deed 
no Hector he destroy by treachery 
and he must die by craft but Priam temper 
will never be bring to any base revenge 
a woman be most subject unto spleen 
and I will use the brain of Hecuba 
this bloody son of Thetis do still dote 
upon the beauty of Polyxena 
and that be the base we now must build upon 
my mother have by secret letter wrought he 
once more to abandon both the field and arm 
the plot be cast which if it well succeed 
he that be of blood insatiate must next bleed 

why will not great Achilles don his arm 
and rouse his bleed Myrmidon shall Troilus 
march back to Troy with armour sword and lance 
all die in grecian blood shall age Priam 
boast in fair Ilium that the son of Thetis 
who warlike spear pierce mighty Hector breast 
lie like a coward slumber in his tent 
because he fear young Troilus 

pardon i 
Ulysses here be a brief from Hecuba 
wherein she vow if I but kill one trojan 
I never shall enjoy Polixena 

but think Achilles if the greek be slay 
and force perforce to march away from Troy 
that he shall then enjoy Polixena 
no it be king Priam subtlety while thou 
sleep in thy tent Troilus through all our troop 
make lane of slaughter body and will toss 
his ball of wildfire as great Hector do 
over all our naval force but do this prince 
lie breathless bleed at Achilles foot 
despair Priam will to make his peace 
make humble tender of Polixena 
and be much proud to call Achilles son 

Were Troilus slay 

who else deal wound so thick and fast as he 
they call he Hector ghost he glide so quick 
through our battalion if he beat we hence 
and we be then compel to sue to they 
it will be answer that great Hector deathsman 
shall never wed his sister Hector son 
will never kneel to he by who strong hand 
his father fall but be young Troilus slay 
and Priam son send wound from the field 
Troy then will stoop and send Polixena 
even to Achilles tent 

my sword and armour 
arise my bleed minister of death 
I will feast you with a ocean of bloodroyal 
Ulysses ere this sun fall from the sky 
by this right hand the warlike Troilus die 

hold if thou be a man 

stand if thou be a soldier do not shrink 

be not thou Troilus young and lusty Troilus 

I be what then 

and I Thersites lame and impotent 
what honour can thou get by kill i 
I can fight 

what make thou in the field then 

I come to laugh at madman thou be one 
the trojan be all mad so be the Greek 
to kill so many thousand for one drab 
for Helen a light thing do thou turn wise 
and kill no more I since these war begin 
shed not one drop of blood 

but proud Achilles 
slay my bold brother and you grecian all 
shall perish for the noble Hector fall 

hold the pox take thou hold while I have breath 
I be bind to curse thy finger 

I may have slay young Troilus when his sword 
late sparkle fire out of the spartan helm 
but that have still my fame but I will trace he 
through the whole army when I meet the trojan 
breathless and faint I will thunder on his crest 
some valour but advantage like i best 

let coward fight with coward and both fear 
the base Thersites be no match for i 
oppose I to the proud he in field 
most eminent in arm and best approve 
to make the thirsty after blood to bleed 
and that be the proud Achilles 

who name we 

fate thou have now before i set the man 
who I most seek to thou who I will offer 
to appease Hector ghost a sacrifice 
you widow matron who now mourn in tear 
and all you watery eye surcease to weep 
father that in this war have lose your son 
and son your father by Achilles hand 
no more lament upon their funeral arm 
but from this day rejoice posterity 
from age to age this to succession tell 
he fall by Troilus by who Hector fall 

Hector sad fate betide he soldier on 
both brother show like mercy thy vain sound 
that boast lie now level with the ground 

Achilles 

what be he Thersites

have I not save thy life and slay proud Troilus 
by who the greek lie pile in breathless heap 

yes when he be out of breath so thou slay Hector 
gird with thy Myrmidon 

dogged Thersites 
I will cleave thou to thy navel if thou ope 
thy venomous jaw 

do do good dogkiller 

you slave 

I be out of breath now too else bugbate greek 
thou dare not to have touch i 

to who do thou address thy embassy 

to Achilles 

and not the general it concern our place 
to hear king Priam embassy 

let i have passage to Achilles tent 
there Agamemnon if you please may hear 
what Priam send to your great champion 

let it be so 

the general wrong that honour 
we prince in our love confer on he 
have I the imperial mandat in my mouth 
I will not lose one jot of my command 
for all the proud Achilles on earth 
take he at best he be but a fellow peer 
and shall lift his head above the cloud 
I hold myself his equal 

untutored Aiax 

who speak that word 

it be I Achilles let the son of Priam 
be private with we 

it belong to we 
to be partaker of his embassy 

dismiss then our inferior you Ulysses 
be welcome Menelaus Diomedes 
let Aiax stay without and know his duty 

duty o you god 
ha in what dialect speak he that language 
which Greece yet never know we owe to he 
I will after he and drag he from his tent 
and teach the insolent manner give i way 
Ulysses thou and all the world shall know 
that save the obedience that I owe the god 
and duty to my father Telamonius 
Aiax know none no not to Agamemnon 
for what he have of i be my courtesy 
what he claim else or the proud greek that breath 
I will pay he in the poor and base scorn 
contempt be ere express in 

Aiax you be too bold with great Achilles 
you bear yourself more equal than you ought 
with one so trophy 

bold o my merit 
be you so soon forget why king of Ithaca 
what have this toy above so talk of do 
save slay Hector which at best receive 
be but scarce fair which the common tongue 
voice with base advantage 

yes prince Troilus 
surname the second Hector lie imbake 
in his cold blood slay by Achilles hand 
the stream of glory now run all towards he 
Achilles look for it Aiax 

but when Achilles slumber in his tent 
or wake with his lute court the air 
then Aiax do not bear himself too bold 
with this great champion when I save our fleet 
from Hector wildfire I deserve some praise 
but then your tongue be mute 

you in these time 
do not affect ostent but still go on 
but Thetis son look for a world of sound 
to spread his attribute 

the proud Achilles 
shall not outshine i long in the next battle 
if to kill trojan be to dim his praise 
I will quench his luster by my bloody ray 

shall I return that answer to king Priam 

Say in the morning we will visit he 
so bear our kind regreet to Hecuba 

but will Achilles trust himself with Priam 
who warlike son be by his valour slay 

Priam be honourable see here be his hand 
his queen religious and behold her name 
Polixena divine read here her vow 
honour religion and divinity 
all joint promise Achilles safety

I for the bright lady in all Asia 
will not so trust my person with the father 

I be resolve Ulysses you once tell i 
Priam will sleep if Troilus once be slay 

and I dare gauge my life the reverent king 
intend no treason to Achilles person 
but mere by this honourable league 
to draw our warlike champion from the field 

but we will deceive his hope fear not great king 
when to my tent I bring Polixena 
the soon Troy lie level with the ground 
you understand i lord shall I entreat you 
associate i unto the sacred temple 
of divine Phoebus 

in i these king shall answer we in peace 
will bring Achilles to Apollo shrine 
provide priam ere we enter Troy 
will give we hostage for our safe return 

my honour hand with he 

o Paris till Achilles lie as dead 
as do thy brother Hector at his foot 
his body hack with as many wound 
as be thy brother Troilus when he fall 
I never never shall have peace with heaven 
or take thou for their brother or my son 

mother I hate Achilles more than you 
but I have hear he be invulnerable 
his mother Thetis from the oracle 
receive answer he shall die at Troy 
be yet a child and to prevent that fate 
she dip he in the sea all save the heel 
these part she drench remain impenetrable 
but what her dainty hand forbear to drown 
as loath to feel the coldness of the wave 
that and that only may be pierce with steel 
now since I know his fellow king intend 
to be his guard to Ilium what be my rage 
or this my weapon to destroy a prince 
who flesh no sword can bite off 

have I not hear thou Paris praise thyself 
for skill in archery have I not see 
a shaft send level from thy constant hand 
command the mark at pleasure may not thou 
with such a arrow and the selfsame bow 
wound proud Achilles in that undrenched part 
and by his heel draw line blood from his heart 

Well think on the rare cunning of this hand 
none save the power immortal can with stand 
when in the temple he shall think to embrace 
my sister Polixena I will strike he there 
the greek be enter Troy let we fill the train 
to avoid suspect and now my shaft and bow 
Greece from my hand receive thy overthrow 

though the damage you have do to Troy 
may cease our arm and arm our brow with wrath 
yet with a smooth front and heart unfeigned 
now bid Achilles welcome welcome all 
before these king and in the sight of Helen 
the dear of my daughter Polixen

and let it not offend thy deity 
that in thy temple I exhaust his blood 
without respect of place revenge seem good 

it be do Achilles bleed immortal power 
clap hand and smile to see the greek fall dead 
by who the valiant Hector blood be shed 

Priam thou have dishonourable break 
the law of arm 

by all the god I vow 
I be a stranger to this horrid act 
it never come from Priam 

call for your surgeon then to stop his wound 

for if he die it will be register 
for ever to thy shame 

a surgeon there 

it be in vain for live that god of physic 
we grecian honour in a serpent shape 
he can not staunch my blood know fellow king 
my mother Thetis by who heavenly wisdom

how cheer Achilles though thy too much pride 
which hold the heart of Aiax from thy love 
he will be the foremost to revenge thy death 

gramercy noble Aiax Agamemnon 
Ulysses Diomedes I feel my strength 
begin to fail let i have burial 
and then to arm revenge Achilles death 
or if proud Troy remain invincible 
to Lycomedes send to youthful Pyrrhus 
my son beget on bright Dedamia 
and let he force his vengeance through the heart 
of these by who his father be betray 
I faint may every drop of blood I shed 
exhale by Phoebus putrify the air 
that every soul in Asia that draw breath 
may poison die for great Achilles death 

he be dead the pride of all our grecian army

as he do Hector base 

take it withal truce time to bury it 

Come prince on your shoulder bear he then 
brave of soldier and the best of man 

where be mighty Priam 

what be the news Aeneas

and be as youthful spirit as the spring 
Penthesilea queen of Amazon 
with mighty troop of virgin warrior 
gallant virago for the love of Hector 
and to revenge his death be enter Troy 
may it please you to receive the scithean queen 

what Troy can yield or Priam can express 
the amazonian princess shall partake 
come Hecuba and lady let we prepare 
to bid her friendly welcome to this war 

Come come spread spread up with the pulpit straight 
seat for the judge all the king of Greece 
why when you lazy drudge be this place 
for a whole jury royal where be the armour 
the prize for which the crafty fox Ulysses 
and mad bull Aiax must this day contend 
what be all ready rare world when instead 
of smooth tongue lawyer soldier now must plead 

this session valiant duke of Salamine 
and king of Ithaca be call for you 
since great Achilles armour be the prize 
due to the worthy here before these king 
and in the face of all the multitude 
you be appoint for your several plea 
that prince who to these arm can prove most right 
shall wear his purchase in the army sight 

if to the worthy they belong to i 
can you select amongst all this throng of prince 
none worthy than Ulysses to contend 
with Aiax and in view of all our navy 
of all these tall ship gild with Hector flame 
which when Ulysses flee into his tent 
ay I extinguish these twelve hundred ship 
I save at once deserve Achilles arm 
Laertes son may think it grace enough 
that though he miss his aim he may be say 
to have strive with Aiax Aiax who excel 
as much in arm as he in eloquence 
my hand perform more than his tongue can speak 
act more than he can talk be I less valiant 
and have but half my vigour like he weak 
my royal birth will for this armour speak 
duke Telamonius that in the Argo sail 
to Colchos and in Ilium second sack 
first rear Alcides colour on the wall 
my father be his father Aeacus 
on of the three that judge infernal soul 
and Aeacus be son to jupiter

since he be dead my brother arm to have 
what have Ulysses with our kin to do

grave hero if not honour prize my merit 
I plead both worth and blood these arm to inherit 

believe i two sound plea on Aiax part 
I fear the prize will be confer on he 

his argument be maxim and sound proof 
to win he way into the soldier heart 

let he proceed 

because I haste to the siege of Troy 
when he feign madness must he wear these arm 
when in the phalanx with old Nestor charge 
thou at the name of Hector flee the field 
and leave the good old man encompass round 
call aloud Ulysses Ulysses stay 
the more he cry the more thou make thy way 
prince Diomedes you see it and upbraid 
this ithacan base flight but see heaven justice 
old Nestor escape great Hector be not there 
but meet Ulysses as he flee from Hector

for at the sight of Hector down he fall 
and cry aloud for aid I come and see thou 
quake with terror under Hector arm 
the ponderous blow I take upon my targe 
and as the least of all my noble deed 
save these faint limb from slaughter which now sue 
to don these glorious arm nor do I blame thou 
for fear Hector what be he of Greece 
that save Aiax quake not at his name 
yet do I meet that Hector guile in blood 
of grecian prince fight with he so long 
till all the host deaf with our horrid stroke 
begird we with amazement will thou know 
my honour in this combat it be this 
I be not conquer if thou still contend 
imagine but that field the time the foe 
Hector alive thou quake at his foot 
and Aiax interpose his broad shield 
betwixt death and thou and thou the arm must yield 

what can the wise Ulysses say to this 
Aiax prevail much with the multitude 
the general murmur do accord with he 

I ever think the son of Telamonius 
do better merit the achillean arm 
then the dulichian king 

forbear to censure 
till both be full hear 

methinks grave hero you shall seek a Aiax 
to wear these arm not let these arm be seek 
by Aiax what have sly Ulysses do 
to countervail my act kill unarm Rhesus 
and set on sleepy Dolon in the night 
steal the Palladium from the trojan fane 
o brave exploit nor have thou these perform 
without the help of warlike Diomedes 
so you betwixt you shall divide these spoil 
Alas thou know not what thou seek fond man 
thou that fight all by craft and in the night 
the radiant splendour of this burnish helm 
shine in darkness as the sun by day 
thy thievish spoil and ambush will betray 
thy politic head be too weak to bear this cask 
this massy helm thou can not mount his spear 
his warlike shield that bear the world engrave 
will tire thy arm fool thou do ask a spear 
a shield a cask thou have not strength to wear 
now if these king or the vain people error 
so far shall err from truth to give they thou 
it will be a means to make thou soon die 
the weight will lag thou that be wont to fly 
thou have a shield unscare my sevenfold targe 
with thousand gash piecemeal from my arm 
and none but that will fit i to conclude 
go bear these arm for which we two contend 
into the midrank of our enemy 
and bid we fetch they thence and he to wear they 
by who this royal armour can be win 
I have rather fight than talk so I have do 

if with your prayer o grecian king my vow 
may have prevail with heaven there have be then 
no such contention thou have keep thy arm 
and we Achilles thou but since the fate 
have take he from we who have now more right 
to claim these arm he dead than he that give they 
unto Achilles live nor great prince 
let that smooth eloquence yond fellow scorn 
if it be any be reject now 
and hurt his master which so many time 
have profit whole Greece if we plead blood 
which be not we but all our ancestor 
Laertes be my father his Arcesius 
his jove from who I be three beside I claim 
a second godhead by my mother name 
what do we talk of birth if birth shall bear they 
his father be near jove than he 
shall wear this honour or if next of blood 
Achilles father Peleus shall enjoy they 
or his son Pyrrhus but we plead not kindred 
or near propinquity let alliance rest 
his be the armour that deserve it best 
Achilles mother Thetis be foretell 
her son shall die at Troy conceal he from we 
in habit of a lady to this siege 
I bring he therefore challenge all his deed 
as by Ulysses do it be I sack Thebes 
Chriscis and Scylla with Lernessus wall 
I Troilus and renown Hector slay 
first with this helmet I adorn his head 
he give it live who demand it dead 

it be true for like a pedlar be disguise 
and come where Achilles spend his youth 
in womanish habit the young lady they 
look on his glass jewel and fine toy 
he have a bow too much Achilles draw 
so by his strength the ithacan he know 
have Aiax go Achilles then have stay 
Hector still live our ransack tent to invade 
what can thou do but bare fight no more 
I can both fight and counsel I direct 
the manner of our battle and propose 
for victual and munition to supply 
the universal host cheer up the soldier 
to endure a tedious siege when all the army 
cry let we away for Greece and raise their tent 
Aiax among the foremost have trust up 
his bag and baggage when I rate he 
and they and all and by my oratory 
persuade their retreat what Greece have win 
from Troy since then be by Ulysses do 
behold my wound o grecian and judge you 
if they be coward mark they be in my breast 
let boast Aiax show such noble scar 
these grecian hero take I in your war 
I grant he fight with Hector it be well do 
where thou deserve well I will give thou due 
but what be the success of that great day 
Hector of Troy unwounded go away 

now sure the prize will to Ulysses fall 
the murmur soldier mutter his desert 
prefer he fore Aiax hear the rest 

but o Achilles when I view these arm 
I can but lament thy obsequy 
thou wall of Greece when thou be base slay 
I take thou on my soldier and from Troy 
bear thou then arm in the habiliment 
I once more seek to bear behold that shield 
it be a description cosmographical 
of all the earth the air the sea and heaven 
what be the Hyades or grim Orion 
he plead or what be Arcton thy rude hand 
will lift a shield thou can not understand 
to omit my deed of arm which all these know 
better than I can speak when in the night 
I venture through Troy gate and from the temple 
rape the Palladium than I conquer Troy 
Troy while that stand can never be subdue 
in that I bring away their god their honour 
Troy ruin and the triumph of whole Greece 
what have blunt Aiax do to countervail 
this one of i he do with Hector fight 
I ten year war have end in one night 
what Aiax do be but by my direction 
my counsel fight in he and all his honour 
if they be any he may thank i for 
what he have do be since his flight I stay 
I therefore claim these arm so I have say 

such be the clamour of the multitude 
and such Ulysses be your great desert 
that those rich arm be thou the prize enjoy 

to the defence of Greece and sack of Troy 

Come prince now this strife be well determine 

to see how eloquence the people charm 
Ulysses by his tongue have gain these arm 

counsel prevail above strength herald proclaim 
through the whole camp Ulysses glorious name 

what dream thou Aiax

shall clothe a coward back nor be it strange 
I will go turn coward too and henceforth plot

the bold warrior and the cunning statesman 
the first seek honour and the last his health 
the valiant hoard the knock the wise the wealth

will have become it brave the disgrace 
of lose such a armour by contention 
will live to all posterity and the shame 
in stygian Lethe drown great Aiax name
