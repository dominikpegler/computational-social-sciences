too hot and why he may be honest but he have the 
countenance of a old subtle knave well I will attend you Ex 

now what to i 

have I not keep my word 

thou have 

store thou with all the supplement 
man use can ask

man to come to thy release just at the instant danger 

his approach be fortunate and happy 

then speak free 
do ever in thy life time meet a friend 
who word assure trust and constancy 
can rank with i in all thing 

never any but what may this infer 

proof of thy gratitude or to be term unthankful 

speak wherein 

will thou in mere 
requital of so many do to i one fair office 

first propose it and then expect a answer

servant and kitchen maid in hell employ by i 
for some know cause who have play such prank there 
no man be so bold dare lodge within the room

no whit inferior to that grecian queen 
that launch 1000 ship from Aulis gulf 
and bring they to the fatal siege of Troy 

make but this good I will do it 

and so confirm thou 
a minion to the mighty Belzebub 
and great in our black kingdom exeunt

and take my proffer largesse in such scorn 
as he have be some great king treasurer 
my bounty he defy with shake pocket 
the noise whereof deafen and seem to drown 
the sound of my despise charity 
some piece I will willing have give 

which will he not receive 

mere refuse 
and with a haughty and contemplative smile 
instead of grateful thanks proud demand if I will 
sell my lordship 

do you suffer it 

while I can limit patience I forbear 
to chastise he with a ungentle hand 
but when I find no bound in his distaste 
but that it still exceed law and compass 
I think to chastise his ingratitude 
and do it with my sword 

it be brave do 

I think we make he fly for I be sure some there 
give shameful ground 

but leave that 
how do my daughter relish you of late 
do you not find her come 

affable as any courteous maid alive can be 
to who I do discover these proceed 
which she seem well to relish

pray what be that 

to think my house shall be so strange trouble 
in dead of night 

it be prodigious sure 

and that I fear it be my mother spirit 
who for some unknown cause restless walk 
as one not sleep in her quiet grave 
it be this that move i deep 

I have send 
to one friar Bernard a religious man 
and tutor to friar john to learn from he the depth of 
this concealment and see in happy time 
Treatwell be return Ent Treatwell 

sir I have conference with he 

will he do it 

by no entreaty or persuasive skill 
nay be he press by menace or command 
he vow to have no hand in these design 
I can not make he think such thing can be 
he count they mere imposture fallacy 
or let a man receive they at the best 
illusion of the devil that ghost walk 
he say direct it be impossible 
and in that faith he will die further discourse 
I can by no mean get he listen to but half displease he leave i 

that be his faith but we be force to credit 
otherwise by lamentable proof Ent m changeable 

here come your husband he have perhaps some news 

I have be labour toil and moil 
to find the cause of this so strange distemperature 
question divine and talk with cunning man 
with fortuneteller skill in palmistry 
not a taint Gipsy can escape my search but I with such 
have traffic 

and what comfort 

troth small or none yet most in this conclude 
that pretend judgement that till we find some one 
to lodge without companion in that bed 
and in the dead of darkness question it 
why to what end and for what cause it walk 
the vision shall continue this they say 
but none among they all so resolute as to 
attempt the adventure 

then it be desperate 

not so for come from the friary late 
I meet a man by chance that cross my way 
who rather too much spirit have possess 
or too much folly make mere desperate 
will willing attempt it and indeed 
he do entreat it of i as a suit 

what reason move he to it 

because he be mad 
for who of understanding or of sense 
will willing confront great Belzebub 
perhaps despair distraction discontent 
or fury have possess he be it what will 
what be that to we he be the certain danger 
we the assure gain 

what may he be 

one like enough be Hercules alive 
with he in Theseus stead to enter hell

within can tame he be he twice so wild 

but he to be receive of all man live 
I do not love that fellow

what better way more secret and more safe 
can we devise to be revenge than this 
to have he piecemeal tear by hag and fiend

his oath will be assistant to their fury 
and further not repel it you by this 
be from a rival free my daughter Nan

and then no further trouble 

it shall be do

but that this be my devil stratagem 
to have his sergeant death arrest i here 
and bear i to that curse dungeon hell 
a usurer will do it any fat sergeant 
that look as plump in cheek as the other lean 
then why not these their gain be but petty trash 
but these the precious riches of a soul 
yet in these hellhound have I great trust 
than in those dog of the earth for I be sure 
the devil himself can be no usurer

nor yet at peace within disquiet 
with sudden fear nor yet well reconcile

lest I be take nap yet I will throw i 
upon the bed and read 
Hey hey the devil dance sure hell be break loose 
and this be their Shrove Tuesday horn upon you

but what be she enter now to who the rest 
do such obeisance place she in her state 
as if she be the queen grim Pluto steal 
and great Alcides once redeem from hell 
be thou ghost shadow fury fiend or hag 
introth thou be a fair one in heaven name 
what be thou speak do answer i in smile 
why do thou beckon i point to those shadow 
as be the meat essential have I a stomach 
with thou I dare not eat do laugh at i 
o have thou but a substance to that presence 
I will dare on thou be thou the infernal dam 
temptation still I will think she what she seem 
for no affright can lodge in her fair look 
and venture somewhat near she be leave alone 
and single I will to she what will you have i
