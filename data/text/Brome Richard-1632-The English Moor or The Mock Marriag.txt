it be a flat conspiracy 
this be your bashful modest whimper niece 

then let they in if they wrong we tonight 
the law tomorrow shall afford we right 
pray let we resolve to see t here come their prologue 

at a late parliament hold by the god 
Cupid and hymen fall at bitter odds 
upon a argument wherein each do try 
to advance his own above tother deity 
out of this question which may happy prove 
love without marriage or marriage without love 
by the effect the trial must be make 
so each from other office draw his aid 
Cupid no more of Hymen match frame 
nor Hymen marry those that love inflame 
now mark the sad effect this strife beget 
Cupid his fiery dart and arrow shoot 
as thick as ere he do and equal heart 
he wound with equal love but Hymen part 
their forward hand alas and join none 
but those which his new matchmaker bring on 
old greedy avarice who by his spell 
in breast of parent and of guardian dwell 
that force their tenderling to loathe bed 
which uncouth policy to sorrow lead 
thousand a thousand way of which the least 
be this with which we celebrate your feast 

a special drove of horn beast 

these few be think enough to show how more 
will appear horrible the town have store 
the first be a lawyer who by strife prevail 
to wed a wife that be by love entail 
unto that courtier who have the hap 
soon after to adorn he with that cap 
the next a country cormorant who great wealth 
by a bad father will obtain by stealth 
that valiant soldier mistress for which matter 
the engineer his sconce with ram do batter 
This a old goatish usure that must 
needs buy a wretch daughter to his lust 
dote and marry she without a groat 
that herald give this crest unto his coat 
and that be the citizen so broad pated 
which this mad butcher cuckold antedate 
now by this dance let husband that do wed 
bride from her proper love to loathe bed 
observe his fortune music strike aloud 
the cuckold joy with merry pipe and crowd 

how now all vanish the devil take the hindmost 

the foremost I say and lay he a block 
for all the rest to break their neck upon 

who be they can you guess 

Truly not I sir 
some of my husband friend perhaps that come 
to warn he of his fortune 

well consider 

Lock the door after they and let we to bed 
and lock ourselves up chick safe from all danger 

we will to bed chick since you will have it so 
this key shall be your guard and here be another 
shall secure i my house have store of bed in it 
I bring you not to a unfurnish dwelling 

be not afraid to lie with i good man 
I will so restore thou gain with caudle and cockbroth 
so cuckle thou up tomorrow thou shall see 

o immodesty 

thou have good store of gold and shall not want it 
in cullis in every broth I will boil 
a angel at the least 

I will hang first 

I be quite out of wit and yet I will counsel 
thou nephew hark thou 

it be like to be mad counsel 

but will you not lie with i then 

no marry shall he not

where be the maid I say and bachelor 
to disappoint my husband

I mean to take your point but you have none 
o thrifty age my bridegroom be so wise 
in stead of point to hazard hook and eye 

Shee mean the eye in his head I will hang else 
my master be like to make a blind match here 

take up the light sirrah 

I hope she talk so idle but for want 
of sleep and sleep she shall for i tonight 

and well say nephew will you to your chamber mistress 

Hey ho to bed to bed to bed

upon so small acquaintance yet you be welcome 
I like your hand and carriage 

it be your favour 
but love they say sweet mistress be receive 
at the first sight and why not service then 
which often bring more absolute return 
of the dear trust impose and firm faith 
by servant then by lover 

stay there Phillis 
I may by that conjecture you have be 
deceive by some false lover 

who I mistress 
I hope I look too merry for such a one 
somewhat too coarse too to be belove 
if I be sad and handsome than it may 
be think I be a little love sick pray 
how long have this disease affect you 
this melancholy mistress not ever since 
you lose your father I hope 

for the most part 
thou say methinks that love may be take in 
at the first fight 

there it be I find she 
love mistress yes a maid may take in more 
love at one look or at a little loophole 
than all the doddy pole in town can purge 
out of her while she live she smother it 
and not make know her passion there be the mischief 

suppose she love a enemy to her house 

a enemy put case the case be you 

but it be no case of i put by I pray thou 

I will put it to you though I miss your case 
suppose it be your house and master Arthur 
who father be your father enemy 
be your belove 

pray thou no more 

now I have strike the vein suppose I say 
all this be true will you confound yourself 
in smother your love which in itself 
be pure and innocent until it grow 
to a pernicious disease within you 
and hide it in your bosom till it work 
your kindle heart to ash 

thou have win 
my patience to attention therefore tell i 
if thou can find or think it honourable 
in i to take such a affection 

yes and religious most commendable 
can you but win his love into a marriage 
to beget peace between your family 
how many and what great example have we 
from former age and of late time 
of strong dissension between furious faction 
that to their opposite house have draw in 
either ally and friend whole province 
yea kingdom into deadly opposition 
till the wide wound on both side have send forth 
river of blood which only have be stop 
by the first band of love in marriage 
of equal branch spring from the first root 
of all those hellbred hatred 

my good maid 

yes I have be a good one to my grief 

thou have give i strength to tell thou and I hope 
when it be tell I shall have yet more ease 

I warrant you mistress therefore out with it 

I love that worthy gentleman and be confident 
that in the time of our two father friendship 
he affect i no less but since that time 
I have not see he nor dare mention he 
to wrong my brother patience who be so passionate 
that can he but suspect I breed a thought 
that favour he I be for ever lose 
for this sad cause as well as for the loss 
of my dear father I have sigh away 
twelve moon in silent sorrow and have hear 
that Arthur too but for what cause I know not 
have not be see abroad but spend his time 
in pensive solitude 

perhaps he grieve 
as much for the suppose loss of you 
as of his father too 

the best construction 
I make of his retiredness be the bless 
prevention which I daily pray for of 
a fatal meeting betwixt he and my brother 
which will be sure the death of one or both 
and now that fear invade i as it do always 
my brother be abroad and such a absence 
have not be usual I have not see he 
since yesterday 

fear nothing mistress now you have ease your mind 
let i alone to comfort you and see your brother 

how be it with you sister 

much better now then when you leave i brother 
if not ill accident have happen you 
since your departure as I fear there have 
why look you else so sad speak dear brother 
I hope you do not meet the man you hate 
if you do speak if you have fight and slay he 
I charge you tell that I may know the worst 
of fortune can befall i I shall gain 
perhaps a death by it 

you speak as if you love the man I hate 
and that you fear I have kill he 

not for love 
of he I assure you sir but of yourself 
her fear in this case sir be that the law 
may take from she the comfort of her life 
in take you from she and so she be 
but a dead woman we be speak 
of such a danger just as you come in 
and true sir my heart even tremble 
to think upon it yet pray sir resolve she 

then it be your frivolous fear that wrought in she 
good sister be at peace for by my love to you 
a oath I will not violate I neither see 
nor seek he I but other thought perplex i 

what be you at the wedding brother 

who wedding sister 

your lose love millicent be you now sad 
after your last leave take 

what do you mean 

there may be other match my good brother 

you wrong i shameful to think that I 
can think of other than her memory 
though she be lose and dead to i can you 
be so unnatural as to desire 
the separation of a thought of i 
from her dear memory which be all the comfort 
my heart be marry to or I can live by 

Surely good sir in my opinion 
sharp eager stomach may be better feed 
with airy smell of meat than the bare thought 
of the most curious dainty 

what piece of impudence have you receive 
into my house 

pray brother pardon i 
I take she as I find she for my comfort 
she have by council and discourse wrought much 
ease and delight into my trouble thought
