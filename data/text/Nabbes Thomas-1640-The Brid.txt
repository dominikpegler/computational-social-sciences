the late attempt upon i so to have 
remove the bar he fear may shut he out 
from a inheritance I never covet 
I must not be too credulous what be the reason 
you be so cloudy cousin in your eye

ere they be perfect and preinterpret 
thought that have never being I may then 
just have doubt for innocence unmoved 
at a false accusation do the more 
confirm itself and guilt be best discover 
by its own fear 

pray fancy what you please 
to strengthen your suspicion it be indeed 
so weak ground that unless you prop it 
with better circumstance your own shame 
shall ruin it and justify my truth

accord to the first intention 
as surgeon call it 

Truly sir my neighbour be very skilful he cure my little shock of the mange so perfect that it have fame he through the neighbourhood for a excellent dogleech 

I owe much to your commendation mrs ferret 

Truly neighbour it be not so much worth

I dare not with much confidence rely 
upon this man endeavour will I have 
a surgeon here who judgement and experience 
may give i further satisfaction 
be the french gentleman dispose of safe 

I have confine he to a chamber sir 
a too delightful prison he may feast 
his eye with rarity

extreme sir methinks their difference shall make a very good mean suppose the one be a great drinker or wencher the other must needs be a little one what the one waste in boot the other save in shoe but I will in to the wound gentleman and help to talk away his pain 

by no mean sleep will give he more ease and prevent a distraction which he seem to occasion some fear of by his often digression and interruption of discourse 

Indeed sir I be trouble when I weigh 
the accident and circumstance of it 
nor can we urge he to give satisfaction 
with any positive truth but all his answer 
be careless and imperfect many time 
the second contradict the first and then 
he will name Theophilus as if he be 
the mischief worker but of all kind friend 
your strange relation have beget most wonder 
the roarer and Theophilus brave act 
my cousin not reveal my intent 
the maid leave with the merchant and the monsieurs 
steal away then find with my hurt kinsman 
what to conclude from these 

the news what mean your haste 

a lass sir you be robe

for half my state alas sir they be valuable 
above any thing I own beside 

have Monsieur give you the slip as he give we he may chance be catch in a halter for it

shall pacify i quick 

sure that french man 
be guilty of the fact why shall he fly else 
if by your servant industry that Monsieur 
may be bring back again it will be of consequence 
Something perhaps may be conclude from 
a strict examination of he 

I will employ all the servant I have about it 

they shall have my husband authority with they we will make you a warrant exeunt good rema 

how various be the event that may depend 
upon one action yet the end propose 
not follow the intention accident 
will interpose themselves like those rash man 
that thrust into a throng occasion 
by some tumultuous difference where perhaps 
their busy curiosity beget 
new quarrel with new issue I go on 
from one consideration to another 
yet can determine nothing 

else my pain be fruitless 
Chance bring we hither for what end I know not 
but understand you be here I come 
to ask a daughter from you 

I from you 
must have a wound reputation cure 
it bleed worse than my kinsman who your son 
and daughter be by circumstance suspect

you use to catch i so you have sir fine 
my state my own still though my daughter be lose 

and pray sir keep it doubt not but it will find 
some grateful heir that will preserve the memory 
of such a benefit with witty libel 
upon your glorious life

my intention 
have do it neither do it want the form 
of law for confirmation but it be when 
I be too partial in affection now

hand stain with blood shall never have the power 
to make a distribution of that wealth

shall he be prove a murderer for though 
my cousin die not his intent be such 
revenge will wait on all his action 
and even his charity when he give alm 
will to his conscience so present the fact 
in bloody character that his best deed 
will lose their merit

that he to clear himself of after trouble 
which may arise by any kinsman claim 
attempt this prevention by some other 
if not himself which yet we can urge 
my kinsman to discover 

there be plot 
in these proceed may I sir be witness
