and treat of a marriage with the king 
but wear ambitious wile and poison eye 
there be nor aid of arm nor marriage

Spain mean to spend no powder on the moor 

if king do dally so with holy oath 
the heaven will right the wrong that they sustain 
Philip if these forgery be in thou 
assure thou king it will light on thou at last 
and when proud Spain hope sound to prevail 
the time may come that thou and thou shall fail 

the Portugal lead with decoining hope 
have raise his power and receive our foe 
with honourable welcome and regard 
and leave his country bound and hither bend 
in hope to help Mahamet to a crown 
and chase we hence and plant this negro moor 
that clad himself in coat of hammer steel 
to heave we from the honour we possess 
but for I have myself a soldier be 
I have in pity to the Portugal 
send secret messenger to counsel he 
as for the aid of Spain whereof they hope 
we have dispatch our letter to their prince 
to crave that in a quarrel so unjust 
he that entitle be the catholic king 
will not assist a careless christian prince 
and as by letter we be let to know 
our offer of the seven hold we make 
he thankful receive with all condition 
differ in mind far from all his word 
and promise to king Sebastian 
as we will wish or you my lord desire 

what rest then but Abdelmelec may 
beat back this proud invade Portugal 
and chastise this ambitious negro moor 
with thousand death for thousand damn deed

if thou and thy mislead do thrive amiss 
guiltless be Abdelmelec of thy blood 

captain we have receive letter from the king

when Abdelmelec get the glorious day 
and stall himself in his imperial throne 

lord governor we be in readiness 
to welcome and receive this hapless king 
chase from his land by angry Amurath 
and if the right rest in this lusty moor 
bear a princely heart unvanquishable 
a noble resolution than it be 
in brave Sebastian our christian king 
to aid this moor with his victorious arm 
thereby to propagate religious truth 
and plant his spring praise in Africa 

but when arrive this brave Sebastian 
to knit his force with this manly moor 
that both in one and one in both may join 
in this attempt of noble consequence 
our man of Tangier long to see their king 
who princely face that like the summer son

top and top gallant all in brave array 
the 26 day of june he leave the bay of Lisbon 
and with all his fleet at Cardis happy he 
arrive in Spain the eight of july tarry for the aid 
that Philip king of Spain have promise 
and fifteen day he there remain aboard 
expect when this spanish force will come 
nor step ashore as he be go still 
but Spain that mean and mind nothing less 
pretend a sudden fear and care to keep 
his own from Amurath fierce invasion 
and to excuse his promise to our king 
for which he storm as great Achilles erst 
lie for want of wind in aldest gulf 
and hoist up his sail and anchor weigh 
and hitherward he come and look to meet 
this manly moor who case he undertake

in fatal hour arrive this peerless prince 
to lose his life his life and many life 
of lusty man courageous Portugal 
draw by ambitious golden look 
let fame of he no wrongful censure sound 
honour be object of his thought ambition be his ground 

now tell i Celybin what do the enemy 

the enemy dread lord have leave the town 
of Areil with a thousand soldier arm 
to guard his fleet of thirteen hundred sail 
and muster of his man before the wall 
he find he have two thousand arm horse 
and fourteen thousand man that serve on foot 
three thousand pioner and a thousand coachman 
beside a number almost numberless 
of drudge negro slave and muleteer 
horseboy laundress and courtesan 
and fifteen hundred wagon full of stuff 
for noble man bring up in delicate 

alas good king thy foresight have be small 
to come with woman into Barbary 
with laundress with baggage and with trash 
number unfit to multiply thy host 

their payment in the camp be pass slow 
and victual scarce that many faint and die 

but whither march he in all this haste 

some think he march hitherward 
and mean to take this city of Alcazar 

unto Alcazar oh unconstant chance 

the brave and valiant king of Portugal 
quarter his power in four batallion 
afront the which to welcome we withal 
be six and thirty roar piece place 
the first consist of light arm horse 
and of the garrison from Tangier bring 
be lead by Alvaro Peres de Tavero 
the left or middle battle of italian

with full five hundred harquebus on foot 
and twice three thousand needless arm pike 

great sovereign vouchsafe to hear i speak 
and let Zareo counsel now prevail 
while time do serve and that these Christian dare 
approach the field with warlike ensign spread 
let we in haste with all our force meet 
and hem they in that not a man escape 
so will they be advise another time 
how they do touch the shore of Barbary 

Zareo hear our resolution 
and thus our force we will first dispose 
Hamet my brother with a thousand shot 
on horseback and choice harquebusier all 
have ten thousand with spear and shield 
shall make the right wing of the battle up 
Zareo you shall have in charge the left 
two thousand argolet and ten thousand horse

myself environ with my trusty guard 
of janissary fortunate in war 
and towards Arzil will we take our way 
if then our enemy will balk our force 
in god name let he it will be his best 
but if he level at Alcazar wall 
then beat he back with bullet as thick as hail 
and make he know and rue his oversight 
that rash seek the ruin of this land 

why tell i lord why leave you Portugal 
and cross the sea with we to Barbary 
be it to see the country and no more 
or else to slay before you be assail 
I be ashamed to think that such as you 
who deed have be renown heretofore 
shall slack in such a act of consequence 
we come to fight and fight vow to die 
or else to win the thing for which we come 
because Abdelmelec as pity we 
send message to counsel quietness 
you stand amaze and think it sound advice 
as if our enemy will wish we any good 
no let he know we scorn his courtesy 
and will resist his force whatsoever 
cast fear aside myself will lead the way 
and make a passage with my conquer sword 
knee deep in blood of these accurse moor 
and they that love my honour follow i 
be you as resolute as be your king 
Alcazar wall shall fall before your face 
and all the force of this barbarian lord 
shall be confound be it ten time more 

so well become these word a kingly mouth 
that be of force to make a coward fight 
but when advice and prudent foresight 
be join with such magnanimity 
troop of victory and kingly spoil 
adorn his crown his kingdom and his fame 

we have descry upon the mountain top 
a huge company of invade moor 
and they my lord as thick as winter hail 
will fall upon our head at unaware 
best then betimes to avoid this gloomy storm 
it be in vain to strive with such a stream 

behold thrice noble lord uncalled I come

so unaware you will be force to fight 
but know oh king and you thrice valiant lord

that with your power you march into the field 
for now be all the army resolute

Zareo give this man a rich reward 
and thank be the god of just revenge 
that he have give our foe into our hand 
beastly unarm slavish full of shame 
but say how come this traitor to his end 

seek to save his life by shameful flight

and so in purpose to have pass the stream 
his headstrong stead throw he from out his seat 
where dive oft for lack of skill to swim 
it be my chance alone to see he drown 
who by the heel I drag from out the pool 
and hither have he bring thus fill with mud 

a death too good for such a damn wretch 
but sith our rage and rigor of revenge 
by violence of his end prevent be 
that all the world may learn by he to avoid 
to hall on prince to injurious war 
his skin we will be part from his flesh 
and be stiffen out and stuff with straw 
so to deter and fear the looker on 
from any such foul fact or bad attempt 
away with he 
and now my lord for this christian king 
my lord Zareo let it be your charge 
to see the soldier tread a solemn march 
trail their pike and ensign on the ground 
so to perform the prince funeral
