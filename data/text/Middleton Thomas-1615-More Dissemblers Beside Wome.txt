to melancholy strain from 
the duchess lodging 
that strange great widow 
that have vow so stiff 
never to know love heat in a second husband 
and she have keep the fort most valiant 
to the wonder of her sex this seven year day 
and that be no sorry trial a month constancy 
be hold a virtue in a citywidow 
and be they excel by so much more in the court 
my faith a rare example for our wife 
heaven blessing of her heart for it poor soul

what will thou do faith now 
if I be dead suppose I wear thy husband 
as short I will be and that be as good 
speak free and thou love i 

Alas sir 
I shall not have the leisure to make vow 
for die present I shall be dead 
before you be lay out 

now fie upon thou for a hasty dier 
will thou not see i bury 

talk not on it sir 
these many year unless you take delight 
to see i swoon or make a ghost of i 

alas poor soul I will kiss thou into colour 
can thou paint pale so quick I perceive then 
thou will go beyond the duchess in her vow 
thou will die indeed what be he 

be settle sir 
spend neither doubt nor fear upon that fellow 
health can be more trusty to man life 
than he to my necessity in love 

I take he of thy word and praise his face 
though he look scurvy I will think hereafter 
that honesty may walk with fire in his nose 
as well as brave desert in break clothes 
but for thy further safety I have provide 
a shape that at first sight will start thy modesty 
and make thou blush perhaps but it will away 
after a qualm or two virginity 
have be put often to those shift before thou 
upon extremity a little boldness 
can be call immodesty especial 
when there be no mean without it for our safety 
thou know my uncle the lord cardinal 
wear so severe a eye so strict and holy 
it not endure the sight of womankind 
about his lodging 
hardly a matron of fourscore be admit 
though she be wear to gum she come not there 
to mumble matin all his admiration 
be place upon the duchess he like she 
because she keep her vow and like not any 
so do he love that man above his book 
that love no woman for my fortune sake then 
for I be like to be his only heir 
I must dissemble and appear as fair 
to his opinion as the brow of piety 
as void of all impureness as a altar 
thy ear that and we be safe 

you make i blush sir 

it be but a star shoot from a beauteous cheek 
it blaze beauty bounty and hurt nothing 

the power of love command i 

I shall wither in comfort till I see thou 

my lord I have work for you when you have hour 
free from the care of state bestow your eye 
upon those abstract of the duchess virtue 
my study ornament I make her constancy 
the holy mistress of my contemplation 
whole volume have I write in zealous praise 
of her eternal vow I have no power 
to suffer virtue to go thin clad 
I that have ever be in youth a old man 
to pleasure and to woman and can never love but pity they 
and all their momentary frantic folly 
here I stand up in admiration 
and bow to the chaste health of our great duchess 
kiss her constant name oh my fair lord 
when we find grace confirm especial 
in a creature that be so doubtful as a woman 
we be spirit ravish man of our probation 
feel the sphere music play in their soul 
so long unto the eternize of her sex 
she have keep her vow so strict and as chaste 
as everlasting life be keep for virtue 
even from the sight of man to make her oath 
as uncorrupt as the honour of a virgin 
that must be strict in thought or else that title 
like one of frailty ruin shrink to dust 
no long she be a virgin then she be just 

chaste sir the truth and justice of her vow 
to her decease lord be able to make poor 
man treasury of praise but methinks 
she that have no temptation set before she 
her virtue have no conquest then will her constancy 
shine in the bright goodness of her glory 
if she will give admittance see and be see 
and yet resist and conquer there be argument 
for angel it will outreach the life of praise 
set in mortality shortness I speak this 
not for religion but for love of she 
who I wish less religious and more love 
but I fear she be too constant that be her fault 
but it be so rare few of her sex be take with it 
and that make some amends 

you have put my zeal into a way my lord 
I shall not be at peace till I make perfect 
I will make her victory hard it be my crown 
when I bring grace to great perfection 
and I dare trust that daughter with a world 
none but her vow and she I know she wear 
a constancy will not deceive my praise 
a faith so noble she that once know heaven 
need put in no security for her truth 
I dare believe her face use all the art 
temptation witchery sleight and subtlety 
you temporal lord and all your mean can practise 

my lord not any we 

her resolute goodness 
shall as a rock stand firm and send the sin 
that beat against it into the bosom of the owner weep 

we with her virtue so 

o give i pardon 
I have lose myself in she upon my friend 
your charitable censure I beseech 
so dear her white fame be to my soul love it be 
a affliction but to hear it question 
she be my religious triumph 
if you desire a belief right to she 
think she can never waver than you be sure 
she have a fix heart it can err 
he kill my hope of woman that doubt she 

no more my lord it be fix 

believe my judgement 
I never praise in vain nor ever spend 
opinion idle or lose hope of any 
where I once place it welcome as my joy 
now you all part believer of her virtue 

we be the same most firm 

good opinion 
in other reward you and all your action 
who be near we 

my lord 

Call our nephew there be a work too 
that for blood sake I labour to make perfect 
and it come on with joy he be but a youth 
to speak of year yet I dare venture he 
to old man goodness and gravity 
for his strict manner and win glory by he 
and for the chasteness of his continence 
which be a rare grace in the spring of man 
he do excel the youth of all our time 
which gift of his more than affinity 
draw my affection in great plenty to he 
the company of a woman be as fearful to he 
as death to guilty man I have see he blush 
when but a maid be name I be proud of he 
heaven be not angry for it he be near of kin 
in disposition to i I shall do much for he 
in life time but in death I shall do all 
there he will find my love he be yet too young 
in year to rise in state but his good part 
will bring he in the soon here he come 
what at thy meditation half in heaven 

the better half my lord my mind be there still 
and when the heart be above the body walk here 
but like a idle servingman below 
gape and wait for his master come 

what man in age can bring forth grave thought 

he that live fourscore year be but like one 
that stay here for a friend when death come then 
away he go and be never see again 
I wonder at the youngman of our day 
that they can dote on pleasure or what it be 
they give that title too unless in mockage 
there be nothing I can find upon the earth 
worthy the name of pleasure unless it be 
to laugh at folly which indeed good charity 
shall rather pity but of all the frenzy 
that follow flesh and blood oh reverend uncle 
the most ridiculous be to fawn on woman 
there be no excuse for that it be such a madness 
there be no cure set down for it no physician 
ever spend hour about it for they guess 
it be all in vain when they first love themselves 
and never since dare practice cry heu mihi 
that be all the help they have for it I have rather meet 
a witch far north than a fine fool in love 
the sight will less afflict i but for modesty 
and your grave presence that learn man respect 
I shall fall foul in word upon fond man 
that can forget his excellence and honour 
his serious meditation be the end 
of his creation to learn well to die 
and live a prisoner to a woman eye 
can there be great thraldom great folly 

in make he my heir I make good work 
and they give wealth a blessing where on the contrary 
what curse do he heap upon his soul 
that leave his riches to a riotous young man 
to be consume on surfeit pride and harlot 
peace be upon that spirit who life provide 
a quiet rest for i

unless she may enjoy thou

Alas do you think she ever mean to do it sir 
I will soon believe all a woman speak 
then that she will die for love she have a vow my lord 
that will keep life in she 

believe i then 
that shall have bounteous interest in thy faith 
she be thou and not her vow the more my sorrow 
my toil and my destruction 

my blood dance 

and though that bashful maiden virtue in thou 
that never hold familiar league with woman 
bind fast all pity to her heart that love thou 
let i prevail my counsel stand up to thou 
embrace it as the fullness of thy fortune 
as if all blessing upon earth be close

whole life can never meet with go and present 
your service and your love but on your hope 
do it religious what need I doubt he

I will teach my heart in all to obey your will 

a thing you shall not lose by here come the lord 
go follow you the course that I advise you 
the comfort of thy presence be expect 
away with speed to court she languish 
for one dear sight of thou for life sake haste 
you lose my favour if you let she perish 

and be thou come brave fortune the reward 
of neat hypocrisy that ever book it 
or turn up transitory white of the eye 
after the feminine rapture duchess and I 
be a fit match can be deny of no man 
the best dissembler light on the best woman 
it be sin to part we 

you light of state truth friend much honour lord 
faithful admirer of our duchess virtue 
and firm believer it appear as plain 
as knowledge to the eye of industry 
that neither private motion which hold counsel 
often with woman frailty and her blood 
nor public sight the lightning of temptation 
which from the eye strike spark into the bosom 
and set whole heart on fire have power to raise 
a heat in she above that which feed chaste life 
and give that cherish mean she be the same still 
and seem so serious employ in soul 
as if she can not tend to cast a eye 
upon desert so low as those in man 
it merit famous memory I confess 
yet many time when I behold her youth 
and think upon the lose hope of posterity 
succession and the royal fruit of beauty 
all by the rashness of one vow make desperate 
it go so near my heart I feel it painful 
and wake i into pity oftentimes 
when other sleep unmoved 

I speak it faithful 
for it be poor fame to boast of a disease 
your grace have not endure that pain alone 
it have be a grief of i but where be the remedy 

true there your lordship speak enough in little 
there be nothing to be hope for but repulse 
she be not to seek for armour against love 
that have bid battle to his power so long 
he that shall try she now have need come strong 
and with more force than his own argument 
or he may part disgrace be put to flight 
that soldier be tough have be in seven year fight 
her vow be invincible for you must grant this 
if those desire train up in flesh and blood 
to war continual against good intent 
prove all too weak for she have advantage 
both of her sex and her unskilfulness 
at a spiritual weapon want knowledge 
to manage resolution and yet win 
what force can a poor argument bring in 
the book that I have publish in her praise 
commend her constancy and that be fameworthy 
but if you read i over with eye of enemy 
you can just and with honour tax i 
that I dissuade her life from marriage there 
now heaven and fruitfulness forbid not I 
she may be constant there and the hard war 
of chastity be hold a virtuous strife 
as rare in marriage as in single life 
nay by some writer rare hear their reason 
and you will approve they fair she that be single 
either in maid or widow oftentimes 
the fear of shame more than the fear of heaven 
keep chaste and constant when the tempest come 
she know she have no shelter for her sin 
it must endure the weather of all censure 
nothing but sea and air that poor bark feel 
when she in wedlock be like a safe vessel 
that lie at anchor come what weather can 
she have her harbour at her great unlade 
much may be steal and little waste the master 
think himself rich enough with what he have 
and hold content by that How think you now lord 
if she that may offend safe do not err 
what be chaste in other be most rare in she 

what wisdom but approve it 

but my lord 
this shall be tell to she it concern most 
pity such good thing shall be speak and lose 

that be the way to lose they utter 
you quite forget her vow yet now I think on it 
what be that vow it be but a thing enforce 
be it not lord 

mere compel indeed 

only to please the duke and force virtue 
fail in her merit there be no crown prepare for it 
what have we do my lord I fear we have sin 
in too much strictness to uphold she in it 
in cherish her will for woman goodness 
take counsel of that first and then determine 
she can true be call constant now 
if she persevere rather obstinate 
the vow appear force as it prove 
try by our pure thought the grace and triumph 
of all her victory be but idle glory 
she wilful and we enemy to succession 
I will not take rest till I tell her soul 
as free as I talk to those I keep 

and we will all second you my lord 

agree 
we will knit such knot of argument so fast 
all wit in she shall not undo in haste 

nay sure I think all we shall be too hard for she 
else she be a huge wild creature 

if we win 
and she yield marriage then will I strike in 

thou tell i happy thing if they be certain 
to bring my wish about wondrous strange
