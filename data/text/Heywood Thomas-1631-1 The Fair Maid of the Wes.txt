and what be the sum 

let i see eight shilling and six penny 

how can you make that good write they a bill 

I will watch they for that it be no time of night to use our bill the gentleman be no dwarf and with one word of my mouth I can tell they what be to betall 

how come it to so much 

imprimis six quart of wine at seven penny the quart seven sixpence

because as they come in by hab nab so I will bring they in a reckon at six and at seven 

well wine 3 s 6 d 

and what want that often groat 

it be two penny over 

then put six penny more to it and make it 4 s wine though you bate it they in their meat

for my dear Spencer I propose i this 
among many sorrow some mirth be not amiss 

what be you think sir 

troth of the world what any man shall see in it 
to be in love with it 

the reason of your meditation 

to imagine that in the same instant that one forfeit all his estate another enter upon a rich possession as one go to the church to be marry another be hurry to the gallows to be hang the last have no feeling of the first man joy nor the first of the last man misery at the same time that one lie torture upon the rack another lie tumble with his mistress over head and ear in down and feather This when I true consider I can but wonder why any fortune shall make a man ecstasy 

you give yourself too much to melancholy 

these be my maxim and be they as faithful practise by other as true apprehend by i we shall have less oppression and more charity 

make good thy word 

I say thou have injure i
