must pay her landlord many a groat 
or it will be pull out of her throat 
brethren my so may I thrive 
as I wish not to be alive 
to see such deal with extremity 
the rich have all the poor live in misery 
but follow the counsel of john ball 
I promise you I love you all 
and make division equal 
of each man good indifferent 
and right may you follow arm 
to rid you from these civil harm 

Well say parson so may it be 
as we purpose to prefer thou 
we will have all the rich man displace 
and all the bravery of they deface 
and as right as I be Jack straw 
in spite of all the man of law 
make thou archbishop of Canterbury 
and chancellor of England or I will die 
how say thou Wat shall it be so 

i Jack straw or else I will bide many a foul blow 
it shall be no other but he 
that thus favour the commonalty

but let we roundly to this gear 
it be more than time that we be go 
we be be lord my master every one 

and I my master will make one 
to fight when all our foe be go 
well shall they see before we will lack 
we be stuff the gallow till it crack 

I hope we shall have man enough 
to aid we herein what how think thou 

Tag and rag thou need not doubt 

but who shall be captain of the rout 

that shall you two for all our kentish man 

fellow captain welcome let we about it 

agreed fellow captain to London 

here be even work towards for the hangman do you ever see such a crew 
after so bad a beginning what be like to ensue 
faith even the common reward for rebel swingledom swangledom you know as well as I 
but what care they you hear they say they owe God a death and they can but die 
it be dishonour for such as they to die in their bed 
and credit to cape under the gallow all save the head 
and yet by my faith the begin of this riot 
may chance cost many a man life before all be at quiet 
and i'faith I will be among they as forward as the best 
and if aught fall out but well I shall shift among the rest 
and be but a boy may hide i in the throng 
Tyborn stand fast I fear you will be load ere it be long 

and yet lord archbishop your grace do know 
that since the late time of parliament 
wherein this task be grant to the king 
by general consent of either house 
to help his war which he intend to France 
for wreak and just recovery of his right 
how slow their payment be in every place 
that better a king not to command at all 
than be behold to ungrateful mind 

lord treasurer it seem strange to i 
that be win with reason and regard 
of true succeed prince the common sort 
shall be so slack to give or grudge the gift 
that be to be employ for their behoof 
hard and unnatural be the thought of they 
that suck the milk and will not help the well 
the king himself be now but young of age 
if thing shall fall out otherwise than well 
the blame do fall upon the counsellor 
and if I take my aim not all awry 
the multitude a beast of many head 
of misconceive and misconstrue mind 
repute this last benevolence to the king 
give at high court of parliament 
a matter more require for private good 
than help or benefit of common weal 
wherein how much they wrong the better sort 
my conscience bear witness in the cause 

my lord because your word not worthless be 
because they stand on reason sure ground 
and tend unto the profit of the king 
who profit be the profit of the land 
yet give i leave in reverence of the cause 
to speak my mind touch this question 
when such as we do see the people heart 
express as far as time will give they leave 
with heartiness of their benevolence 
my think it be for other happiness 
that heart and purse shall together go 
misdeem not good my lord of this my speech 
sith well I wot the noble and the slave 
and all do live but for a common weal 
which common weal in other term be the king 

the justice and sheriff of Kent send greeting to your honour here by i 

my lord this brief do open unfold 
a dangerous task to we and all our train 
with speed let we impart the news unto my lord the king 
the fearful news that while the flame do but begin 
sad policy may serve to quench the fire 
the commons now be up in Kent let we not suffer this first attempt too far 

my friend what power have they assemble in the field 

my lord a twenty thousand man or there about 

see here the peril that be late foresee 
ready to fall on this unhappy land 
what barbarous mind for grievance more than needs 
unnatural seek wreak upon their lord 
their true anoint prince their lawful king 
so dare this blind unshamefast multitude 
lay violent hand they wot not why nor where 
but be thou still as best become thou 
to stand in quarrel with thy natural liege 
the sun may sometime be eclipse with cloud 
but hardly may the twinkle star obscure 
or put he out of who they borrow light 

I marry what this be another matter methinks the world be change of late 
who will live like a beggar and may be in this estate 

we be here four captain just Jack straw what Tyler Hob carter and Tom miller 
search i all England and find four such captain and by gog blood I will be hang 

so you will be nevertheless I stand in great doubt 

captain straw and captain Tyler I think I have bring a company of Essex man for my train 
that will never yield but kill or else be slay 

and for a little captain I have the vantage of you all 
for while you be a fight I can creep into a quart pot I be so small 

but master what answer make sir john Morton at Rochester 
I hear say he will keep the castle still for the king use 

so he do till I fetch he out by force and I have his wife and child pledge for his speedy return from the king to who he be go with our message 

let he take heed he bring a wise answer to our worship or else his pledge go to the pot 

captain straw how many man have we in the field 

marry captain carter about fifty thousand man 

where shall we pitch our tent to lie in safety 

marry hob upon blackheath beside Greenwich there we will lie 
and if the king will come thither to know our pleasure so it be if not I know what we will do 

gogs blood Jack have we the card in our hand 
let we take it upon we while we have it 

I marry for you know not how long you shall hold it 
fifty thousand man they have already in arm that will draw together 
if we hang together as fast some of we shall repent it 

this strange unwelcome and unhappy news 
of these unnatural rebel and unjust 
that threaten wrack unto this wretched land 
ay i affright my woman maze mind 
burden my heart and interrupt my sleep 
that now unless some better tiding come 
unto my son their true anoint king 
my heavy heart I fear will break in twain 
surcharge with a heavy load of thought 

madam your grace care in this I much commend 
for though your son my lord the king be young 
yet he will see so well unto himself 
that he will make the proud rebel know 
what it be to move or to displease a king 
and though his look bewray such lenity 
yet at advantage he can use extremity 
your grace may call to mind that be a king 
he will not put up any injury 
especial of base and common man 
which be not worthy but with reverence 
to look into the princely state of king 
a king sometime will make a show of courtesy 
only to fit a follow policy 
and it may be the king determine so 
that he will try before he trust a foe 

true madam for your grace son the king 
be so well rule by diverse of his peer 
as that I think the proud foe he have 
shall find more work than he will take in hand 
that seek the downfall of his majesty 
I hope the council be too wise for that 
to suffer rebel in aspire pride 
that purpose treason to the prince and state 
in good time see where my lord the king 
do come accompany with the bishop and lord treasurer 

I marvel much my lord what rage it be 
that move my people who I love so dear 
under a show of quarrel good and just 
to rise against we thus in mutiny 
with threaten force against our state and we 
but if it be as we be give to know 
by letter and by credible report 
a little spark have kindle all this fire 
which must be quench with circumspect regard 
before we feel the violence of the flame 
meanwhile sweet lady mother be content 
and think their malice shall not injure you 
for we have tool to crop and cut they off 
ere they presume to touch our royal self 
and thus resolve that you secure shall be 
what hard mishap soever fall to i 
health and good hap befall your majesty 

my lord here be a messenger from Kent 
that crave access unto your majesty 

admit he near for we will hear he speak 
it be hard when betwixt the people and the king 
such term of threat and parley must be have 
will any gentleman or man of worth 
be see in such a cause without offence 
both to his god his country and his prince 
except he be enforce thereunto 

I can think so good a gentleman 
as be that knight sir john Morton I mean 
will entertain so base and vild a thought 
nor can it sink into my woman head 
that be it not for fear or policy 
so true a bird will file so fair a nest 
but here he come oh so my long mind 
desire to know the tiding he do bring 

the commons of Kent salute your majesty 
and I be make their unhappy messenger 
my lord a crew of rebel be in field 
and they have make commotion late in Kent 
and draw your people to a mutiny 
and if your grace see not to it in time 
your land will come to ruin by their mean 
yet may your grace find remedy in time 
to qualify their pride that thus presume 

who be the captain of this rebel rout 
that thus do rise against their anoint king 
what be they man of any worth or no 
if man of worth I can choose but pity they 

no my good lord they be man of no great account 
for they be none but tiler thatcher miller and such like 
that in their life do never come in field 
before this mutiny do call they forth 
and for security of my back return 
upon this message which I show the king 
they keep my wife and child for a pledge 
and haul i out from forth my castle at Rochester 
and swear i there to come unto your majesty 
and have tell you their mind 
I hope your grace will pardon i for all 
in that I be enforce thereunto 

how many man have they assemble in the field 

I think my lord about twenty thousand man 
but if your grace will follow my advice 
thus will I deal with these rebellious man 
I will find time to parley with some of they 
and know what in their mind they do intend 
for be arm with such treacherous thought 
they may perform more than your grace expect 

with speed return to those unnatural man 
and see sir john you greet they thus from we 
tell they that we ourself will come to they 
to understand their meaning and their mind 
and tell they if they have any evil sustain 
ourself will see sufficient recompense 
go good sir john and tell they upon the Thames 
ourself will meet with they 
there to confer concern their avail 
do so sir john and kind recommend we to they all 

we shall fulfil your grace mind in this 
and thus I take my congee of your majesty 
wish your grace thrice Nestor year to reign 
to keep your land and guard your royal train 

farewell good knight and as thou dare remember they though they forget themselves 

your grace herein be very well advise 
with resolution fit your degree 
your grace must show yourself to be a king 
and rule like god viceregent here on earth 
the look of king do lend both life and death 
and when a king do set down his decree 
his sentence shall be irrevocable 
your grace herein have show your princely mind 
in that you hate to pray on carrion flesh 
such pray befit not king to pray upon 
that may command and countermand their own 
I hope my lord this message so will prove 
that public hate will turn to private love 
and therefore I say my lord you have answer well 
the task be give your grace by act of parliament 
and you have reason to demand your dew 

my lord I hope we shall not need to fear 
to meet those man that thus do threaten we 
we will my lord to morrow meet with they 
and hear my lord what it be that they demand 
mother your grace shall need to take no care 
for you shall in our tower of London stay 
till we return from Kent to you again 
my lord see every thing prepare for we 
and mother thus I leave your majesty 
you to the tower and I must hence to Kent 

my lord if so you please take my advice herein 
that speak in love and duty to your grace 
I shall in every matter privilege your majesty and all your lordly train 
I mean against your manor of Greenwich town 
and so amid the stream may hover safe 
meanwhile they send some few and choose man 
to give your grace to understand their mind 
and thus my lord I have adventure 
to show your majesty my mind herein 

it be good to make provision for peradventure we shall lack victual and we lie in camp on black heath long 
and in faith as long as this goose last we will not starve 
and as many good fellow as will come to the eat of she come and welcome 
for in faith I come light by she 
and light come light go 
we captain be lord within ourselves 
and if the world hold out we shall be king short 

the rest of my fellow captain be go before to Greenwich to meet the king 
that come to know our mind 
and while they be about it 
I will make good cheer with my goose here 
what be the goose fly away without her head 

here be a stir more than needs 
what mean the king thus to abuse we 
And make we run about his pleasure and to no end 
he promise we to meet we on the water 
and by lady as soon as we come at the water side 
he fair and flat turn his barge and away he go to London 
I tell thou what we will not put up this abuse 

by gog blood captain straw we will remove our camp and away to London roundly 
and there we will speak with he or be know why we shall not 

God amercy what and ere we have do 
we will be lord every one 

gentle Jack straw in one line let we draw 
and we will not leave a man of law 
nor a paper worth a hawe 
and make he worse than a daw 
that shall stand against Jack straw 

methinks you may do well to answer the king 
in the name of the whole company 
some dozen or twenty man for the nonce that may deliver the mind of you all in few word 

sir john Morton you be a ass to tell we what we have to do 
hold your prate you be best 

I tell thou sir john thou abuse we 
but let we to London as fast as we can 
my lord if all our man be come unto the shore 
let we return again into the town 
these people be not to be talk withal 
much less with reason to be order 
that so unorderly with shriek and cry 
make show as though they will invade we all 
I have not hear nor read of any king 
so ungentle of his people entertain 

sir john what be the cause the king return so soon 
and with such 〈◊〉 so quick take the shore 

bargeman the king have reason for the same warrant thou he be not ill advise 

I think he mean to have commence some talk with that  

he mean so indeed Spencer but you hear how it fall out 

not well I hold my stern so hard 

it be thus the king and all his company 
be row with oar so far as Greenwich town 
it be a world to see what troop of man 
like bee that swarm about the honey hive 
begin strew the gravel ground and sandy plain 
that fill the air with cry and fearful noise 
and from the water do a echo rise 
that pierce the year of our renown king 
affright so his heart with strong conceit 
of some unhappy grievous stratigene 
that trust i with my ear I hear he say 
he think they will have all like spaniel 
take water desperate and 〈◊〉 he 
so do they all yfere like 〈◊〉 man 
that time he think to speed away apace 
and take the best advantage of the place 

Indeed I can not great blame his majesty 
myself be not so scare this seven year 
my thought there be sufficient mouth enough 
at high tide to have draw the Thames dry 

Spencer ere it flow thrice at London bridge 
London I fear will hear of worse news 

neighbour you that keep the gate let the king liege people in or we must be fain to aid they with ball of wild fire or some other devise for they have spoil all Southwark let out all the prisoner break up the Marshalsea and the king bench and make great havoc in the burrow here 
therefore I pray you let they in 

porter open the gate if thou love thyself or thy own life open the gate 

you have a certain spare goose come in to be roast 
she be enough by this 

what mean these wretched miscreant 
to make a spoil of their own country man 
unnatural rebel whatsoever 
by foreign foe may seem no whit so strange 
as Englishman to trouble England thus 
well may I term it infest to the land 
like that foul lawless force and violence 
which Cyneris do offer to his child 
o happy time from all such trouble free 
what now alas be like to be the end of this attempt 
but that so long as they be glut all with blood they bathe therein 
sirrah here it be set down by our captain that as many of you as can say bread and cheese in good and perfect english you die for it and that be the cause so many stranger do die in Smithfield 
let i hear you say bread and cheese 
Brock and Keyse 

sir Newton and lord mayor this wrong that I be offer 
this open and unnatural injury 
a king to be thus hardly handle 
of his own people and no other foe 
but such as have be bring up and breed in his own bosom 
nourish with his tender care 
to be thus rob of honour and of friend 
thus daunt with continual fright and fear 
hale on to what mishap I can tell

be in fright your worthy lady mother 
make foul slaughter of your noble man 
burn up book and 〈◊〉 of record 
devise house of hostility

and beat down like wolf the better sort 
the great wrong in my opinion be 
that in honour do your person touch 
I mean they call your majesty to parley 
and over bear you with a multitude 
as if you be a vassal not a king 
oh wretched mind of vild and barbarous man 
for who the heaven have secret wreak in store 
but my lord with reverence and with pardon too 
why come your grace into Smithfield near the crew

beside our guard that do attend on we 

may it please your grace that I shall raise the street 
to guard your majesty through Smithfield as you walk

and be a mean to shed a world of blood

to hear they speak and have adventure 
to come among this foul verily crew 
and lo my lord see where the people come
