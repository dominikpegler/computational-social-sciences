unsanctified match they make we loath 
the most natural desire our grandam Eve ever leave we 
force one to marry against their will why it be 
a more ungodly work then enclose the commons 

prithee peace

I can think of matter new enough

how now sweet mistress 
you have make sorrow look lovely of late 
you have weep 

she have do nothing else these three day have you stand behind the arras to have hear she shed so much salt water as I have do you will have think she have be turn fountain

to take a inventory of all that be i 

what to do with it lady 

to make you a deed of gift

in likeness of a separation

to be marry to another can you ever think 
that I shall ever thrive in it be I not then bewitch 
all comfort I can teach myself be this 
there be a time leave for i to die noble 
when I can live so 

give i in a word to who or by who mean 
be you thus tear from i 

by lord Ercole my mother and by brother 

I will make his bravery fit for a grave 
then for a wedding 

so you will beget 
a far more dangerous and strange disease 
out of the cure you must love he again 
for my sake for the noble Ercole 
have such a true compassion of my sorrow 
hark in your ear he show you his right worthy 
demeanour to i 

o you pretty one 
I have see this lord many a time and oft 
set she in his lap and talk to she of love 
so feel I do protest it have make i 
run out of myself to think on it o sweet breathe 
monkey how they grow together well it be my opinion 
he be not woman friend that do invent 
a punishment for kiss 

if he bear himself so noble 
the manly office I can do for he 
be to afford he my pity since he be like 
to fail of so dear a purchase for your mother 
your goodness quit she ill for your brother 
he that vow friendship to a man and prove 
a traitor deserve rather to be hang 
than he that counterfeit money yet for your sake 
I must sign his pardon too why do you tremble 
be safe you be now free from he 

o but sir 
the intermission from a fit of a ague 
be grievous for indeed it do prepare we 
to entertain torment next morning 

why he be go to sea 

but he may return too soon 

to avoid which we will instant be marry 

to avoid which get you instant to bed together 
do and I think no civil lawyer for his fee 
can give you better council 

fie upon thou prithee leave we 

be of comfort sweet mistress 

on one condition we may have no quarrel about 

upon my life none this 

none upon your honour 

with who with Ercole 
you have deliver he guiltless 
with your brother he be part of yourself 
with your complemental mother 
I use not sight with woman 
tomorrow we will be marry 
let those that will oppose this union 
grow never so subtle and entangle themselves 
in their own work like spider while we two 
haste to our noble wish and presume 
the hindrance of it will breed more delight 
as black copartament show gold more bright 


be I well habit 

exceed well any man will take you for a merchant but pray sir resolve i what shall be the reason that you be one of the most eminent civil lawyer in Spain and but new arrive from the east Indies shall take this habit of a merchant upon you 

why my son live here in Naples and in his riot 
do far exceed the exhibition I allow he 

so then and in this disguise you mean to trace he 

partly for that but there be other business 
of great consequence 

faith for his expense it be nothing to your estate what to don Crispiano the famous corregidor of civil who by his mere practice of the law in less time than half a jubilee have get thirty thousand ducat a year 

well I will give he line 
let he run on in his course of spend 

free 

free 
for I protest if that I can conceive 
my son will take more pleasure or content 
by any course of riot in the expense 
than I take joy nay soul felicity 
in the get of it shall all the wealth I have 
waste to as small a atomy as fly 
in the unne I do protest on that condition 
it shall not move i 

how be this can he take more pleasure in spend it riotous than you have do by scrape it together oh ten thousand time more and I make no question five hundred young gallant will be of my opinion 
why all the time of your collectionship 
have be a perpetual Callender begin first 
with your melancholy study of the law 
before you come to singer the ruddock after that 
the tire importunity of client 
to rise so early and sit up so late 
you make yourself half ready in a dream 
and never pray but in your sleep can I think 
that you have half your lung leave with cry out 
for judgement and day of trial Remember sir 
how often have I bear you on my shoulder 
among a shoal or swarm of reek nightcap 
when that your worship have bepiss yourself 
either with vehemency of argument 
or be out from the matter I be merry 

be so 

you can eat like a gentleman at leisure 
but swallow it like hapdragon as if you have live 
with chew the cud after 

no pleasure in the world be comparable to it 

possible 

he shall never taste the like unless he study law 

what not in wench sir 
it be a court game believe it 
as familiar as gleek or any other 

wench o fie the disease follow it 
beside can the finger taffeta or lawn 
or a paint hand or a breast be like the pleasure 
in take client fee and pile they 
in several goodly row before my desk 
And accord to the bigness of each heap 
which I take by a lere for lawyer do not tell they 
I veil my cap and withal give great hope 
the cause shall go on their side 

what think you then 
of a good cry of hound it have be know 
dog have hunt lordship to a fault 

cry of cur 
the noise of client at my chamber door 
be sweet music far in my conceit 
than all the haunt in Europe

I marry sir to have he keep a good house 
and not sell it away I will find no fault with that

sigh a soft requiem and let fall a bead 
for two unfortunate noble who sad fate 
leave they both dead and excommunicate

I will say it to you while my mother there 
number her bead 
you that dwell near these grave and vault 
which oft do hide physician fault 
note what a small room do suffice 
to express man good their vanity 
will fill more volume in small hand 
than all the evidence of Churchland 
funeral hide man in civil wear 
and be to the draper a good hear 
make the herald laugh in their black payment 
and all die worthy die worth payment 
to the altar offering though their fame 
and all the charity of their name 
between heaven and this yield no more light 
then rot tree which shine in the night 
o look the last act be the best in the play 
and then rest gentle bone yet pray 
that when by the precise you be view 
a supersede as be not sue 
to remove you to a place more airy 
that in your stead they may keep chary 
stockfish or Seacole for the abuse 
of sacrilege have turn grave to vild use 
how then can any monument say 
here rest these bone till the last day 
when time swift both of foot and feather 
may bear they the sexton ken not whither 
what care I then though my last sleep 
be in the desert or in the deep 
no lamp nor taper day and night 
to give my charnel chargeable light 
I have there like quantity of ground 
and at the last day I shall be find 
now I pray leave i 

I be sorry for your loss 

umh sir the more spacious that the tennis court be 
the more large be the hazard 
I dare the spiteful fortune do her worst 
I can now fear nothing

yet I will have he live 
to satisfy public justice for the death 
of Ercole o go visit he for heaven sake 
I have within my closet a choice relic 
preservative against swoon and some earth 
bring from the holy land right sovereign 
to staunch blood have he skilful surgeon think you 

the best in Naples

whether there be hope of life I pray be near he 
if there be any soul can bring i word 
that there be hope of life 

do you prize his life so 

that he may live 
I mean to come to his trial to satisfy the law 

o be it nothing else 

I shall be the happy woman 

here be cruelty apparel in kindness 
I be full of thought strange one but they be no good one 
I must visit Contarino upon that 
depend a engine shall weigh up my loss 
be they sink as low as hell yet let i think 
how I be impair in a hour and the cause of it 
lose in security o how this wicked world bewitch 
especial make insolent with riches 
so sail with forewind stretch do soon break 
and pyramid of the top be still most weak

I fight for one in who I have no more right 
then false executor have in orphan good 
they cozen they of yet though my cause be nought

I pray continue the report of my death and give out 
cause the church deny i Christian burial 
the vice admiral of my galley take my body 
with purpose to commit it to the earth 
either in Sicily or Malta 

what aim you at by this rumour of your death 

there be hope of life 
in Contarino and he have my prayer 
that he may live to enjoy what be his own 
the fair jolenta where shall it be think 
that I be breathe happy her friend 
will oppose it still 

but if you be suppose dead 
the law will strict prosecute his life 
for your murder 

that be prevent thus 
there do belong a noble privilege 
to all his family ever since his father 
bear from the worthy emperor Charles the five 
a answer to the french king challenge at such time 
the two noble prince be engage to fight 
upon a frontier arm of the sea in a flatbottomed boat 
that if any of his family shall chance 
to kill a man in the field in a noble cause 
he shall have his pardon now sir for his cause 
the world may judge if it be not honest

so silly all their life of their own estate 
that when they be sick and come to make their will

no for the thing you will have i counterfeit 
be most essential put in practice nay it be do 
I be with child already 

ha by who 

by Contarino do not knit the brow 
the precontract shall justify it it shall 
nay I will get some singular fine churchman 
or though he be a plural one shall affirm 
he couple we together 

o misfortune 
your child must then be repute Ercole 

your hope be dash then since your votary issue 
must not inherit the land 

no matter for that 
so I preserve her fame I be strange puzzle 
why suppose that she be bring abed before you 
and we conceal her issue till the time 
of your delivery and then give out 
that you have two at a birth ha be not excellent 

and what resemblance think you will they have 
to one another twin be still alike 
but this be not your aim you will have your child 
inherit Ercole land o my sad soul 
have you not make i yet wretched enough 
but after all this frosty age in youth 
which you have witch upon i you will seek 
to poison my fame 

that be do already 

no sir I do but feign it 
to a fatal purpose as I think 

what purpose 

if you have love or tender my dear honour 
you will have lock your poniard in my heart 
when I name I be with child but I must live 
to linger out till the consumption of my own 
sorrow kill i 

this will not do the devil have on the sudden furnish i with a rare charm yet a most unnatural falsehood no matter so it will take 
stay sister I will utter to you a business 
but I be very loath a thing indeed 
nature will have compassionate conceal 
till my mother eye be close 

pray what be that sir 

you do observe 
with what a dear regard our mother tender 
the lord Contarino yet how passionate 
she seek to cross the match why this be mere 
to blind the eye of the world for she do know 
that you will marry he and he be capable 
my mother dote upon he and it be plot 
cunning between they after you be marry 
live all three together in one house 
a thing I can whisper without horror 
why the malice scarce of devil will suggest 
incontinence between they two 

I remember since his hurt 
she have be very passionate inquire 
after his health 

upon my soul this jewel 
with a piece of the holy cross in it this relic 
value at many thousand crown she will have send he lie upon his death bed 

profess as you say 
love to my mother wherefore do he make 
i his heir 

his will be make afore he go to fight 
when he be first a suitor to you 

to fight o well remember 
if he love my mother wherefore do he lose 
his life in my quarrel 

for the affront sake a word you understand not 
because Ercole be pretend rival to he 
to clear your suspicion I be gull in it too 
shall he not have fight upon it 
he have undergo the censure of a coward 

How come you by this wretched knowledge 

his surgeon overhear it 
as he do sigh it out to his confessor 
some half hour fore he die 

I will have the surgeon hang 
for abuse confession and for make i 
so wretched by the report can this be truth 

no but direct falsehood 
as ever be banish the court do you ever hear 
of a mother that have keep her daughter husband 
for her own tooth he fancy you in one kind 
for his lust and he love 
our mother in another kind for her money 
the gallant fashion right but come never think on it 
throw the foul to the devil that hatch it and let this 
bury all ill that be in it she be our mother 

I never do find any thing in the world 
turn my blood so much as this here be such a conflict 
between apparent presumption and unbelief 
that I shall die in it 
o if there be another world in the moon 
as some fantastic dream I can wish all man 
the whole race of they for their inconstancy 
send thither to people that why I protest 
I now affect the lord Ercole memory 
better than the other 

but be Contarino live 

I do call any thing to witness 
that the divine law prescribe we 
to strengthen a oath be he live and in health 
I will never marry with he 
nay since I have find the world 
so false to i I will be as false to it 
I will mother this child for you 

ha 

most certain it will be guile part of my sorrow 

o most assure make you smile to think 
how many time in the world lordship descend 
to diverse man that may and truth be know 
be heir for any thing belong to the flesh 
as well to the Turk rich eunuch 

but do you not think 
I shall have a horrible strong breath now 

why 

o with keep your counsel it be so terrible foul 

Come come come 
you must leave these bitter flash 

must I dissemble dishonesty you have diverse 
counterfeit honesty but I hope here be none 
will take exception I now must practise 
the art of a great belly woman and go fain 
their qualm and swound 

eat unripe fruit and oatmeal to take away your colour 

dine in my bed some two hour afternoon 

and when you be up 
make to your petticoat a quilt preface 
to advance your belly 

I have a strange conceit now 
I have know some woman when they be with child 
have long to beat their husband what if I 
to keep decorum exercise my longing 
upon my tailor that way and noddle he sound 
he will make the large bill for it 

I will get one shall be as tractable to it as stockfish 

o my fantastical sorrow 
can I now be miserable enough 
unless I wear a pied fool coat 
nay worse for when our passion 
such giddy and uncertain change breed 
we be never well till we be mad indeed 

So nothing in the world can have do this 
but to beget in she a strong distaste 
of the lord Contarino o jealousy 
how violent especial in woman 
how often have it raise the devil up in form of a law case 
my especial care must be to nourish crafty this fiend 
between the mother and the daughter that the deceit 
be not perceive my next task that my sister 
after this suppose childbirth be persuade 
to enter into religion it be conclude 
she must never marry so I be leave guardian 
to her estate and last that my two surgeon 
be wage to the east Indies let they prate 
when they be beyond the line the calenture 
or the scurvy or the indian pox I hope 
will take order for their come back 
o here be my mother I have strange news for you

I do look now for some great misfortune 
to follow for indeed mischief 
be like the visit of franciscan friar 
they never come to pray upon we single 
in what estate leave you Contarino

from the former sorrow to such a question 
I will tell you in the absence of his surgeon 
my charity do that for he in a trice 
they will have do at leisure and be pay for it 
I have kill he

because you think he be father of the child 
but jolenta vow by all the right of truth

make my love know direct it have not be 
beyond example for a matron 
to affect in the honourable way of marriage 
so youthful a person o I shall run mad 
for as we love our young child best 
so the last fruit of our affection 
wherever we bestow it be most strong 
most violent most unresistable 
since it be indeed our late harvesthome

than all the excellent work we have do before 
and my son have deprive i of all this ha my son

I will cut off his right pap that give he suck 
to shoot he dead I will no more tender he 
then have a wolf steal to my tear in the night 
and rob i of my milk nay such a creature 
I shall love better far ha ha what say you 
I do talk to somewhat methinks it may be 
my evil genius do not the bell ring 
I have a strange noise in my head o fly in piece 
come age and wither i into the malice 
of those that have be happy let i have 
one property more than the devil of hell 
let i envy the pleasure of youth hearty 
let i in this life fear no kind of ill 
that have no good to hope for let i die 
in the distraction of that worthy princess 
who loathe food and sleep and ceremony 
for thought of lose that brave gentleman 
she will fain have save have not a false countenance 
let i sink where neither man 
nor memory may ever find i

as her confessor I will not have you see yet 
till I prepare she peace to you lady

world for this your contemplation be the earth

that your crown may be the great why my son

Shee be with child by Contarino and he dead 
by who shall she preserve her fame to the world

to exercise my virtue then to father it 
and preserve her credit and to marry she 
I will suppose she Contarino widow bequeath to i 
upon his death for sure she be his wife 
but that the ceremony of the church be want 
report this to she madam and withal 
that never father do conceive more joy 
for the birth of a heir than I to understand

grow a excellent good huswife for she have set 
her woman to spin flax and to that use 
have in a study which be build of stone 
store up at least a hundred weight of flax 
marry such a thread as be to be spin from the flax 
I think the like be never hear of 

what be that 

you may be certain she will lose no time 
in brag that her husband have get up 
her belly to be short at seven month end 
which be the time of her delivery 
and when she feel herself to fall in travel 
she make she wait woman as by mischance 
set fire to the flax the flight whereof 
as they pretend cause this gentlewoman 
to fall in pain and be deliver 
eight week afore her reckon 

now sir remember the lambskin 

the midwife straight howl out there be no hope 
of the infants life swaddle it in a stead lambskin 
as a bird hatch too early make it up 
with three quarter of a face that make it look 
like a changeling cry out to Romelio 
to have it christen lest it shall depart 
without that it come for and thus be many serve 
that take care to get gossip for those child 
to which they may be godfather themselves 
and yet be no archpuritan neither 

no more 

pray my lord give he way you spoil his oratory else thus will they jest be they feed to open their sister case 

you have urge enough 
you first affirm her husband be away from her 
eleven month 

yes my lord 

and at seven month end 
after his return she be deliver 
of this Romelio and have go her full time 

true my lord 

so by this account this gentleman be beget 
in his suppose father absence 

you have it full 

a most strange suit this it be beyond example 
either time past or present for a woman 
to publish she own dishonour voluntary 
without be call in question some forty year 
after the sin commit and her council 
to enlarge the offence with as much oratory 
as ever I do hear they in my life 
defend a guilty woman it be most strange 
or why with such a poison violence 
shall she labour her son undo we observe 
obedience of creature to the law of nature 
be the stay of the whole world here that law be break 
for though our civil law make difference 
between the base and the legitimate compassionate nature 
make they equal nay she many time prefer they 
I pray resolve i sir have not you and your mother

none that ever arrive at my knowledge 

bethink yourself this can choose but savour 
of a woman malice deep and I fear 
you be practise upon most devilish 
How happen gentlewoman you reveal this no soon 

while my husband live my lord I dare not 

I shall rather ask you why you reveal it now 

because my lord I loathe that such a sin 
shall lie smother with i in my grave my penitence 
though to my shame prefer the reveal of it 
above worldly reputation 

your penitence 
may not your penitence have be as hearty 
though it have never summon to the court 
such a conflux of people 

Indeed I may have confess it 
private tooth church I grant but you know repentance 
be nothing without satisfaction 

satisfaction why your husband be dead 
what satisfaction can you make he 

the great satisfaction in the world my lord 
to restore the land tooth right heir and that be my daughter 

o she be straight beget then

if he be a bastard and must forfeit his land for it 
she have prove herself a strumpet and must lose 
her dower let they go beg together 

who shall pay we our fee then 

most just 

you may see now what a old house 
you be like to pull over your head dame 

can I conceive this publication 
grow from a hearty penitence I can bear 
my undo the more patient but my lord 
there be no reason as you say even now 
to satisfy i but this suit of she 
spring from a devilish malice and liar pretence 
of a grieve conscience and religion

have a most bloody unnatural revenge 
hide under it o the violence of woman 
why they be creature make up and compound 
of all monster poison mineral 
and sorcerous herb that grow 

be you angry yet 

will man express a bad one 
let he forsake all natural example 
and compare one to another they have no more mercy 
then ruinous fire in great tempest 

take heed you do not crack your voice sir 

hard heart creature good for nothing else 
but to wind dead body 

yes to weave seem lace with the bone of their 
husband that be long since bury and curse they when they tangle

take bastardy so distasteful when in the world 
a many thing that be essential part 
of greatness be but byslip and be father 
on the wrong party 
preferment in the world a many time 
base beget nay I have observe 
the immaculate justice of a poor man cause 
in such a court as this have not know who 
to call father which way to direct itself 
for compassion but I forget my temper 
only that I may stop that lawyer throat 
I do beseech the court and the whole world 
they will not think the base of i 
for the vice of a mother for that woman sin 
to which you all dare swear when it be do 
I will not give my consent

whatsoever I have attempt 
against my own fame or the reputation 
of that gentleman my son the lord Contarino
