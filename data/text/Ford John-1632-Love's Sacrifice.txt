a prince who eye be chooser to his heart 
be seldom steady in the list of love 
unless the party he affect do match 
his rank in equal portion or in friend

I court thou for love without respect 
to youth or state and yet thou be unkind 
Fernando leave that sorceress if not 
for love of i for pity of thyself 

injurious woman I defy thy lust

into the secret of a heart unsoiled 
you be my prince sister else your malice 
have rail itself to death but as for i 
be record all my fate I do detest 
your fury or affection judge the rest

if then thou shall betray my trust thy faith 
to the pollution of a base desire 
thou be a wretched woman 

speak your love 
or fear my lord
