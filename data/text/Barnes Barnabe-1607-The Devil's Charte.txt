unto the castle for some parlance 
upon such article as be set down 

Come we will touch he summon forth a parley 
what office bear you march on those wall 
we make no summons to confer with you 

Most christian prince please your mightiness 
I be castillian of saint Angelo under his holiness

Most Christian Charles here I salute your grace 
bid you peaceable welcome to Rome 
if you bring peace along with you to Rome 

in filial love I thank your holiness 
we little think it our most holy father 
that our allegiance to the church of Rome 
which we with all our predecessor tender 
shall have enforce you to take sanctuary 

son Charles know then we take not to this place 
in fear as to some refuge or asyle 
but for as much as news be bring in post 
that you with all your force do approach 
arm and in hostile manner to this city 
the conclave think it fit tender the safety 
of holy church and sacred privilege 
to know your meaning first and then with pomp 
to make your welcome in saint Peter palace 
in the best fashion with due ceremony 

know then most holy father what we will 
have in tedious march from France thus far 
past with our force God still guide we 
as we be deep bind by law of nature 
and reason to work sure for our right 
we leave no busy doubt nor obstacle 
which may prevent we in our just imprease 
hence be it that we do capitulate 
so strict with the crafty florentine 
who we well know favour Alphonso part 
and this make Venice join in league with we 
yet have notice that your holiness 
both with Alphonso that usurp my crown 
and his son Ferdinand draw deep in 
upon consideration of more weight 
we think it good to take France in our way 

and there to crave some certain caution 
of your indifferency to his just title 
have in the crown of Naples therefore first 
we do require if you these party tender 
as your late letter do import yield up 
in caution of your good intent to France 
this castle which you now retain against we 

why Lodowick the weathercock be turn 
the wind stand fair but how long will that hold 
so may we put in hazard our whole church 
the dear estate of Christ flock militant 
and bring confusion unto Christendom 

so may you seize upon the church right 
if that we shall refer all to your trust 

this be saint Peter bulwark for my part 
here I will die ere I surrender it 

now find I true which common bruit proclaim 
of your bad meaning and hypocrisy 
but I refer your conscience to that judge 
who if my conscience harbour any thought 
to wrong the church of God in any thing 
I call in justice to revenge on i 

renown Charles suppose we shall surrender 
how may we be secure that you will 
restore it after your imprease at Naples 

the faith and honour of a christian king 

your faith and honour stay most christian Charles 
man will not yield up castle upon word 
unless their state and life grow desperate 

why make we long parley with this pope 
who falsehood be so much that neither oath 
nor honesty can purchase place with he 

who never yet in cause of consequence 
have keep his promise 

tell we will you grant 

what shall we grant most christian king of France 
and tell i true be it your own case 
whether you will on such slight promise 
accord to such uneven condition 

we do not think our royal promise 
have be so slight censure in your heart 
but since we find your infidelity 
we must requite it with extremity 
cousin mountpanseir 

my lord 

forthwith cause ten brass piece with their shot 
and powder to be draw out of saint mark 
such as you find most fit for battery 
you will not hear we now we speak so low 
stand aloft you proud scorn inferior 
we will send our mind write in fiery note 

give doubtful answer be not peremptory 
lest through your heat his rage exasperate 

offer unto he on his princely word 
the strength of Terracina for a pledge 

victorious Charles such be my trust and love 
that neither fear of force nor violence 
can any way induce i to suspect you 
hence come it that the port of Rome be open 
at our behest to give you guestning 
accept we therefore with our promise 
which we shall under hand and seal confirm 
not any way to cross your action 

if you will yield up castle Angelo 
resolve we present without delay 

because it be saint Peter citadel 
the conclave be in doubt to make surrender 

you will not yield then 

we can nor we will not yield it up 

why then a parley with our ordinance 

what come you to make pillage of the church 
which hold you dear as her chief champion 
for bear your violence in the name of God 
fear the scourge and thunder from above 
our offer be both just and reasonable 

piece which be of more validity 
we mean to tender to your majesty 

what be those piece you will tender we 

to render present the citadel 
of Terracina Cinita Vecchia and Spoleto 

and we receive they very thankful 
S p ad vin our voice of the conclave pass that Charles 
shall be possess of castle Angelo 

and if your meaning with your word accord 
we dare engage our soul for resurrender 

your soul foh foh they stink in sight of God and man 
your soul why they be sell to Lucifer

that you will sell saint Peter patrimony

how how how how how be that 
Deh quella malitia del diabolo Deh quello veleno del inferuno 
and for what stand this figure then 

why for eighteen this figure stand for octavo refer unto di● last before signify the eight day after so that annos undicem without distinction signify eleven year and this figure seven add to day and that octavo post import the eight day follow moriere thou shall die I mean thy body with thy soul in respect of heaven 
thus many day have thou continue pope

my soul be a divine light first create 
in likeness lively form to the word 
which word be God that God the cause of cause 
my soul be substance of the live God 
stamp with the seal of heaven who character 
be his eternal word at which hell tremble 

and what of that thou therein have no part 
I do confess thy soul be first ordain 
to good but by freewill to sin thou slave 
have sell that soul from happiness to hell 

mark yet what I can answer for this soul 
mighty jehovah most exuperant

the world and man world reasonable and immortal 
man reasonable but dissoluble and mortal 
and therefore man be call Microcosmus 
the little world and second type of God

and element which be within the world 
man then that do participate with all 
through operation conversation and symbolisation 
with matter in the subject proper 
with the element in body quadrifary 
with grow plant in virtue vegetative 
in sense with beast with heaven by the influence 
of the superior spirit into the inferior 
in wisdom and capacity with angel 
with Eloym in that great continent 
be without doubt preserve by that God 
find all thing contain in himself 

answer i vain philosopher to this 
thou that have plant man in this perfection 
not look on thy detestable soul 
which first like a pure leaf of white lily 
clear from all blemish be bestow by God 
and thou foul beast do shameful pollute it 
be it not one of human faculty 
to propose for yourselves the best you can 
where other creature carry with blind force 
make themselves bondslave to the present time 
the scope of man creation be to glorify 
the most all potent maker of all thing 
the Alpha and Omega of all bounty 
but he that wilful betray this soul 
that precious jewel wherein God delight 
dishonour God and do deprive himself 
of all salvation and beatitude 

rest with this answer that my soul be god 
who habitacle be prepare in heaven 
first it do know God be figure 
accord to that image of himself 
and then the world who lively shape it bear 
and to conclude the soul of man know all 
because with all thing it do symbolize 
for in this man there be a mind intelligent 
a quicken word and a celestial spirit 
that like a lightning every way diffuse 
all thing which be make by the mighty power 
unit move and replenish 

these thing shall have be think upon before 
the summum bonum which live in the soul 
be a eternal pleasure to behold 
and have fruition of the mighty power 
which thou do never see nor can enjoy
