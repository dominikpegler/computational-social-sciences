I be as close as can be 
and stand upon as strong and honest guard too 
unless this warlike age need a portcullis 
yet I confess I love he 

Hear the people 

now I say hang the people he that dare 
believe what they say dare be mad and give 
his mother nay his own wife up to rumor 
all ground of truth they build on be a tavern 
and their best censure be sack sack in abundance 
for as they drink they think they never speak modest 
unless the wine be poor or they want money 
believe they believe Amadis de Gaul 
the knight of the sun or Palmerin of England 
for these to they be modest and true story 
pray understand i if their tongue be truth 
and if in vino veritas be a oracle 
what woman be or have be ever honest 
give they but ten round cup they will swear Lucretia 
die not for want of power to resist Tarquin 
but want of pleasure that he stay no long 
and Portia that be famous for her piety 
to she love lord they will face you out die of the pox 

well there be something sister 

if there be brother

my thing be marriage and at his return 
I hope to put their squinteye right again 

marriage it be true he father be a rich man 
rich both in land and money he his heir 
a young and handsome man I must confess too 
but of such quality and such wild fling 
such admirable imperfection sister 
for all his travail and buy experience 
I shall be loath to own he for my brother 
methinks a rich mind in a state in different 
will prove the better fortune 

if he be wild 
the reclaim he to good and honest brother 
will make much for my honour which if I prosper 
shall be the study of my love and life too 

you say well will he think as well and love too 
he marry he will be hang first he know no more 
what the condition and the tie of love be 
the honest purpose and ground of marriage 
nor will know nor be ever bring to endeavour 
than I do how to build a church he be ever 
a loose and strong defier of all order 
his love be wanderer they knock at each door 
and taste each dish but be no resident 
or say he may be bring to think of marriage 
as it will be no small labour thy hope be stranger 
I know there be a labour match now follow 
now at this time for which he be send for home too 
be not abuse Natolet have two fair daughter 
and he must take his choice 

let he take free 
for all this I despair not my mind tell i 
that I and only I must make he perfect 
and in that hope I rest 

since you be so confident 
prosper your hope I will be no adversary 
keep yourself fair and right he shall not wrong you 

when I forget my virtue no man know i exeunt

I love that plainspoken gentlewoman admirable 
and certain I can go as near to please she 
if downright do she have a perilous countenance 
if I can meet one that will believe i 
and take my honest meaning without circumstance

yes if the man be lovely 
that be be honest modest I will have he valiant 
his anger slow but certain for his honour 
travail he shall be but through himself exact 
for it be fair to know manner well than country 
he must be no vain talker nor no lover 
to hear himself talk they be brag of a wanderer 
of one find no retreict for fair behaviour 
will you learn more

and bring up invita Minerva at her needle 
my dog must look their name too and all spartan 
Lelaps Melampus no more fox and Baudiface

before ten word of she 

do you find he now 
do you think he will be ever firm 

I fear not exeunt 

never tell i of this happiness it be nothing 
the state they bring with be seek to scurvy 
I have rather make my own play and I will do 
my happiness be in my own content 
and the despise of such glorious trifle 
as I have do a thousand more for my humour 
give i a good free fellow that stick to i 
a jovial fair companion there be a beauty 
for woman I can have too many of they 
good woman too as the age reckon they 
more than I have employment for

my only fear be that I must be force 
against my nature to conceal myself 
health and a able body be two jewel 

if either of these two woman be offer to i now 
I will think otherwise and do accord 
yes and recant my heresy I will sir 
and be more tender of opinion 
and put a little off my travail liberty 
out of the way and look upon they serious 
methinks this gravecarried wench 

methinks the other 
the homespoken gentlewoman that desire to be fruitful 
that treat of the full manage of the matter 
for there lie all my aim that wench methinks 
if I be but well seton for she be a fable 
if I be but hound right and one to teach i 
she speak to the matter and come home to the point 
now do I know I have such a body to please she 
as all the kingdom can fit she with I be sure on it 
if I can but talk myself into her favour 

that be easy do 

that be easy say will it be do 
you shall see then how I will lay about i 
if I be virtuous it will never grieve i 
or any thing that may justify my modesty 
but when my nature be prone to do a charity 
and my calfstongue will not help i 

will you go to they 
they can but take it courteous 

I will do my part 
though I be sure it will be the hard I ever play yet 
a way I never try too which will stagger i 
and if it do not shame i I be happy 

win they and wear they I give up my interest 

what say you monsieur Bellure 

will I can say 
or sing or any thing that be but handsome 
I will be with she present 

you be no venture 
a merry ready wench 

a vengeance squibber 
she will fleer i out of faith too 

I will be near thou 
pluck up thy heart I will second thou at all brunt 
be angry if she abuse thou and beat she a little 
some woman be win that way 

pray be quiet 
and let i think I be resolve to go on 
but how I shall get off again 

I be persuade 
thou will so please she she will go near to ravish thou 

I will it be come to that once let i pray a little 

now for thy honour Pinac board i this modesty  
warm but this freeze snowball it will be a conquest 
although I know thou be a fortunate wencher 
and have do rare in thy day above all thy venture 

you will be ever near 

at all necessity 
and take thou off and set thou on again boy 
and cherish thou and stroke thou 

help i out too 
for I know I shall stick in the mire if you see we close once 
be go and leave i to my fortune sudden 
for I be then determine to do wonder 
farewell and fling a old shoe how my heart throb 
will I be drink farewell Pinac heaven send we 
a joyful and a merry meeting man 

farewell 
and cheer thy heart up and remember Bellure 
they be but woman 

I have rather they be lion 

about it ill be with you instant exeunt 
shall I never be at rest no peace of conscience enter Oriana 
no quiet for these creature be I ordain 
to be devour quick by these shecanibal 
here be another they call handsome I care not for she 
I never look after she when I be half tipple 
it may be I shall turn she and peruse she 
or in my want of woman I may call for she 
but to be haunt when I have no fancy 
no maw to the matter now why do you follow i 

I hope sir it be no blemish to my virtue 
nor need you out of scruple ask that question 
if you remember you before your travel 
the contract you tie to i it be my love sir 
that make i seek you to confirm your memory 
and that be fair and good I can suffer 
I come to give you thank too 

for what prethee 

for that fair piece of honesty you show sir 
that constant nobleness 

how for I be short head 

I will tell you then for refuse that free offer 
of monsieur Nantolet those handsome beauty 
those two prime lady that may well have press you 
if not to have break yet to have bow your promise 
I know it be for my sake for your faith sake 
you slip they off your honesty compel you 
and let i tell you sit it show most handsome 

and let i tell thou there be no such matter 
nothing intend that way of that nature 
I have more to do with my honesty than to fool it 
or venture it in such leak bark as woman 
I put they off because I love they not 
because they be too queasy for my temper 
and not for thy sake nor the contract sake 
nor vow nor oath I have make a thousand of they 
they be thing indifferent whether keep or break 
mere venial slip that grow not near the conscience 
nothing concern those tender part they be trifle 
for as I think there be never man yet hope for 
either constancy or secrecy from a woman 
unless it be a ass ordain for sufferance 
nor to contract with such can be a trial
