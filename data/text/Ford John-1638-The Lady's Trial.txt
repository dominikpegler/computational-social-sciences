no stranger to your bosom sir ere now 
you may have sort i in your resolve 
companion of your fortune 

So the wrong 
I shall have venture on against thy fate

of my adventure from the counsel know 
my want do drive i hence 

want so you say 
and it be not friendly speak 

hear i further 

Auria take heed the covert of a folly 
willing to range be not without excuse 
discover in the coinage of untruth 
I use no hard language thou be near 
already on a shipwreck in forsake 
the holy land of friendship in forsake 
to talk your want fie 

by that sacred thing 
last issue from the temple where it dwell 
I mean our friendship I be sink so low 
in my estate that bid i live in Genoa 
but six month long I survive the remnant 
of all my store 

Umh 

in my country friend 
where I have side my superior friend 
sway opposition friend friend here to fall 
subject to scorn or rare find compassion 
be more than man that have a soul can bear 
a soul not stoop to servitude 

your show 
nor certainty nor weak assurance yet 
of reparation in this course in case 
command be proffer 

he who can merit 
preferment by employment let he bare 
his throat unto the turkish cruelty 
or die or live a slave without redemption 

for that so but you have a wife a young 
a fair wife she though free can never claim 
right in prosperity be never tempt 
by trial of extreme to youth and beauty 
bait for dishonour and a perish fame 

show i the man that live and so my face 
dare speak scarce think such tyranny against 
Spinella constancy except Aurelio 
he be my friend 

there live not then a friend 
dare love you like Aurelio that Aurelio 
who fair and early often say and true 
your marriage with Spinella will entangle 
as much the opinion due to your discretion 
as your estate it have do so to both 

I find it have 

he who prescribe no law 
no limit of condition to the object 
of his affection but will mere wed 
a face because it be round or limb by nature 
in pure red and white or at the best 
for that his mistress owe a excellence 
of quality know when and how to speak 
where to keep silence with fit reason why 
who virtue be her only dowry else 
in either kind ought of himself to master 
such fortune as as add fuel to their love 
for otherwise but herein I be idle 
have fool to little purpose 

she be my wife 

And be so it be not manly do 
to leave she to the trial of her wit 
her modesty her innocence her vow 
this be the way that point she out a art 
of wanton life 

sir say you 

you form reason 
just one for your abandon the storm 
which threaten your own ruin but propose 
no shelter for her honour what my tongue 
have utter Auria be but honest doubt 
and you be wise enough in the construction 

necessity must arm my confidence 
which if I live to triumph over friend 
and ere come back in plenty I pronounce 
Aurelio heir of what I can bequeath 
some fit deduction for a worthy widow 
allow with caution she be like to prove so 

who I your heir your wife be yet so young 
in every probability so forward 
to make you a father leave such thought 

believe it 
without reply Aurelio keep this note 
a warrant for receive from 〈◊〉 
two hundred ducat as you find occasion 
dispose they in my absence to Spinella 
I will not trust her uncle he good man 
be at a ebb himself another hundred 
I leave with she a four I carry with i

of more debate between we will undo 
my resolution walk a little prithee 
friend we be and will embrace but let we not speak 
another word 

I will follow you to your horse 

with her own hand 

she never use my lord 
a second mean but kiss the letter first 
overlook the superscription then let fall 
some amorous drop kiss it again talk to it 
twenty time over set it to her mouth 
then give it i then snatch it back again 
then cry o my poor heart and in a instant 
commend my truth and secrecy such medley 
of passion yet I never see in woman 

in woman thou be deceive but that we both 
have mother I can say how woman be 
in their own nature model of mere change 
of change of what be nought to what be worse 
she feed you liberal

rather her craft first she begin what pity 
it be that man shall differ in estate 
without proportion some so strange rich 
other so miserable poor and yet 
quoth she since it be very deed unfit 
all shall be equal so I must confess 
it be good justice that the proper man 
shall be prefer to fortune such as nature 
have mark with fair ability of which 
Genoa for aught I know have wondrous few 
not two to boast of 

here begin her itch 

I answer she be happy then who choice 
in you my lord be singular

without prevention 
Guzman the Spaniard late cashier most grave 
observe the full punctilio of his nation 
and he have we beleaguer to accost 
this shepiece under a pretence of be 
grandee of Spain and cousin to twelve prince 

for rival unto who we have enrage 
Fulgoso the rich coxcomb late start

oft time the best physician for admit 
we find no remedy we can miss 
advise in stead of comfort and believe 
it be a ease Malfato to disburden 
our soul of secret clog where they may find 
a rest in pity though not in redress 

let all this sense be yield to 

perhaps you measure what I say the common nature 
of a officious curiosity

brave riddle I will endeavour to unfold it 

how fare the lord Adurni

sound he for courtesy behaviour language 
and every fair demeanour a example 
title of honour add not to his worth 
who be himself a honour to his title 

you know from whence this come 

I do 

do you laugh 
but that I must consider such as spaniel 
to those who feed and cloth they I will print 
thy pandarism upon thy forehead there

she who send this temptation be wife 
to his abuse servant and divorce 
from poor Benatzi senseless of the wrong 
that madam Levidolche and Adurni

I be 
a gentleman free bear I never wear 
the rag of any great man look nor feed 
upon their aftermeal I never crouch 
unto the offal of a office promise 
reward for long attendance and then miss 
I read no difference between this huge 
this monstrous big word lord and gentleman 
more than the title sound for aught I learn 
the latter be as noble as the first 
I be sure more ancient 

let i tell you then 
you be too bitter talk you know not what 
make all man equal and confound all course 
of order and of nature this be madness 

it be so and I have reason to be mad 
reason Aurelio by my truth and hope 
this wit Futelli bring a suit of love 
from Levidolche one however mask 
in colourable privacy be fame 
the lord Adurny pensioner at least 
be I a husband pick out for a strumpet 
for a cast suit of bawdry Aurelio

fall danger what fall can she be a goodness 
above temptation more to be adore 
then sift I be too blame sure 

Levidolche 
for her part too laugh at Malfato frenzy 
just so she term it but for you my lord 
she say she thank your charity which lend 
her crooked soul before it leave her body 
some respite wherein it may learn again 
the mean of grow straight 

she have find mercy 
which I will seek and sue for 

you be happy 

count of Savona Genoa admiral 
lord governor of Corsica enrol 
a worthy of my country seek and sue to 
praise court flatter sure this bulk of i 
tail in the size a timpany of greatness 
puff up too monstrous my narrow chest 
how sure do thou malice these extreme 
uncomfortable man when I be needy 
cast naked on the flat of barren pity 
abate to a ebb so low that boy 
a cockhorse frisk about i without plunge 
you can chat grave then in formal tone 
reason most paradoxical now 
contempt and wilful grudge at my uprise 
becalm your learned noise 

such flourish Auria 
fly with so swift a gale as it will waste 
thy sudden joy into a faithless harbour 

can mutter mischief I observe your dulness 
while the whole ging crowd to i hark my triumph 
be echo under every roof the air 
be straighten with the sound there be not room 
enough to brace they in but not a thought 
do pierce into the grief that cabin hear 
here through a creek a little inlet crawl 
a flake no big than a sister thread 
which set the region of my heart a fire 
I have a kingdom once but be depose 
from all that royalty of bless content 
by a confederacy betwixt love and frailty 

glory in public view but add to misery 
which travail in unrest at home 

at home 
that home Aurelio speak of I have lose 
and which be worse when I have roll about 
toil like a pilgrim round this globe of earth 
weary with care and overwear with age 
lodge in the grave I be not yet at home 
there rot but half of i the other part 
sleep heaven know where will she and I my wife 
I mean but what alas talk I of wife 
the woman will we have together feed 
on any outcast paring course and mouldy 
not live divide thus I can have beg 
for both for it have be pity she shall ever 
have feel so much extremity 

this be not 
patience require in wrong of such vile nature 
you pity she think rather on revenge 

revenge for what uncharitable friend 
on who let we speak a little pray with reason 
you find Spinella in Adurny house 
it be like he give her welcome very likely 
her sister and another with she so 
invite noble do but he with she 
private chamber he deserve no wife 
of worthy quality who dare not trust 
her virtue in the proof of any danger 

but I break open the door upon they 

marry it be a slovenly presumption 
and punishable by a sharp rebuke 
I tell you sir I in my young growth 
have by the stealth of privacy enjoy 
a lady closet where to have profane 
that shrine of chastity and innocence 
with one unhallowed word will have exile 
the freedom of such favour into scorn 
have any he alive then venture there 
with foul construction I have stamp the justice 
of my unguilty truth upon his heart 

Adurni may have do the like but that 
the conscience of his fault in coward blood 
blush at the quick surprisal 

o fie fie 
how ill some argue in their sour reproof 
against a party liable to law 
for have that lord offend with that creature 
her presence will have double every strength 
of man in he and justify the forfeit 
of noble shame else it be enough in both 
with a smile only to correct your rudeness 

it be well you make such use of neighbour courtesy 
some kind of beast be tame and hug their injury 
such way lead to a fame too 

not uncivil though violent friend 

wherefore then think you 
can she absent herself if she be blameless 
you grant of course your triumph be proclaim 
and I in person tell she your return 
where lie she hide the while 

that rest for answer 
in you now I come to thou we have exchange 
bosom Aurelio from our year of childhood 
let i acknowledge with what pride I own 
a man so faithful honest fast my friend 
he who if I speak full never fail 
by teach trust to i to learn of i 
I wish myself thy equal if I aim 
a wrong it be in a envy of thy goodness 
so dear witness with i my integrity 
I lay thou up to heart that from my love 
my wife be but distinguish in her sex 
give back that holy signature of friendship 
cancel deface pluck off or I shall urge 
account score on the tally of my vengeance 
without all former compliment 

do you imagine 
I fawn upon your fortune or intrude 
upon the hope of better my estate 
that you cashier i at a minute warning 
no Auria I dare vie with your respect 
put both into the balance and the poise 
shall make a settle stand perhaps the proffer 
so frank vow at your departure first 
of settle i a partner in your purchase 
lead you into opinion of some end 
of mercenary falsehood yet such wrong 
lest suit a noble soul 

by all my sorrow 
the mention be too course 

since then the occasion 
present our discontinuance use your liberty 
for my part I be resolute to die 
the same my life profess i 

pish your faith 
be never in suspicion but consider 
neither the lord nor lady nor the bawd 
which shuffle they together opportunity 
have fasten stain on my unquestioned name 
my friend rash indiscretion be the bellows 
which blow the coal now kindle to a flame 
will light his slander to all wander eye 
some man in giddy zeal overdo that office 
they catch at of who number be Aurelio 
for I be certain certain it have be 
impossible have you stand wise silent 
but my Spinella tremble on her knee 
will have accuse her breach of truth have beg 
a speedy execution on her trespass 
then with a justice lawful as the magistrate 
may I have draw my sword against Adurni 
which now be sheathe and rust in the scabbard 
good thanks to your cheap providence once more 
I make demand my wife you sir 

roar loud 
the noise affright not i threaten your enemy 
and prove a valiant tongue man now must follow 
by way of method the exact condition 
of rage which run to mutiny in friendship 
Auria come on this weapon look not pale 
at fight of that again hear and believe it 
what I have do be well do and well mean 
twenty time over be it new to do 
I de do it and do it and boast the pain religious 
yet since you shake i off I slight value 
other severity 

honour and duty 
stand my compurgator never do passion 
purpose ungentle usage of my sword 
against Aurelio let i rather want 
my hand nay friend a heart then ever suffer 
such dotage enter here if I must lose 
Spinella let i not proceed to misery 
by lose my Aurelio we through madness 
frame strange conceit in our discourse brain 
and prate of thing as we pretend they be 
join help to i good man and let we listen 
after this stray soul and till we find she 
bear our discomfort quiet 

so doubtless 
she may be soon discover 

that be speak cheerful 
why there be a friend now Auria and Aurelio 
at odds oh it can be must not and shall 
enter Castanna 
but look Castanna be here welcome fair figure 
of a choice jewel lock up in a cabinet 
more precious than the public view shall sully

you may conceive and yet methinks you shall not 
how I be faulty in my sister absence 
indeed it be nothing so nor be I know 
of any private speech my lord intend 
save civil entertainment pray what hurt 
can fall out in discourse if it be modest

with those of their own rank and that be all 
my sister can be charge with 

be it not friend a excellent maid 

deserve the best of fortune 
I ever speak her virtuous 

with your leave

enough to fright her wit not very kind 
to i myself she sigh when you be go 
desire no creature else shall follow she 
and in good truth I be so full of weep 
I mark not well which way she go

I observe 
no party here among we who can challenge 
a motion of such honour 

can your look

than can the peace of a compose soul 
yet I presume report of my attempt 
train by a curiosity io youth 
for scatter cloud before they have raise tempest 
which will at last break out 

hide now most likely 
in the darkness of your speech 

you may be plain 

I shall my lord that I intend wrong 

ha wrong to who 

to Auria and as far 
as language can prevail do 

take advice 
young lord before thy tongue betray a secret 
conceal yet from the world hear and consider 
in all my flight of vanity and giddiness 
when scarce the wing of my excess be fledge 
when a distemperature of youthful heat 
may have excuse disorder and ambition 
even then and so from thence till now the down 
of softness be exchange for plume of age 
confirm and harden never dare I pitch 
on any howsoever likely rest 
where the presumption may be construe wrong 
the word be hateful and the sense want pardon 
for as I dare not wrong the mean so 
he who but only aim by any boldness 
a wrong to i shall find I must not bear it 
the one be as unmanly as the other 
now without interruption 

stand Aurelio 
and justify thy accusation bold 
spare i the needless use of my confession 
and have tell no more than what thy jealousy 
possess thou with again before my face 
urge to thy friend the breach of hospitality 
Adurni trespass in and thou conceive 
against Spinella why proof grow faint 
if bare not suppose I will answer guilty 

you come not here to brave we

to which thy cunning never shall rejoin 
I make my judge my jury be accountant

of a suspicious rage can plead thou have 
enforce the likelihood of scandal 

doubt not 
but that I have deliver honest truth 
as much as I believe and just witness 

lose ground to raise a bulwark of reproach on 
and thus for that my errand hither be not 
in whine truantlike submission 
to cry I have offend pray forgive i 
I will do so no more but to proclaim 
the power of virtue who command sovereignty 
set bound to rebelblood and check restrain 
custom of folly by example teach 
a rule to reformation by reward 
crown worthy action and invite to honour 

honour and worthy action best beseem 
their lip who practice both and not discourse they

some there be 
and they not few in number who resolve 
no beauty can be chaste less unattempted 
and for because the liberty of courtship 
fly from the wanton on the she come next 
meet oft time too many soon seduce 
conclude all may be win by gift by service 
or compliment of vow and with this file 
I stand in rank conquest secure my confidence 
Spinella storm not Auria be a object 
of study for fruition here I angle 
not doubt the deceit can find resistance 

after confession follow
