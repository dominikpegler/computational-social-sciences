what worse than this can the enemy perform 
and when shine friendship best but in a storm 

why dote Lydia be it of no virtue 
to bring our army hither and put in venture 
our person and their life upon our foe 
waste our courage weaken our best force 
impoverish the heart of our munition 
and have win the honour of the battle 
to throw our glory on unworthy spirit 
and so unload victory honey thigh 
to let drone seed 

will nothing satisfy but all
