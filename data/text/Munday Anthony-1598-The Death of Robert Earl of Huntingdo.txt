if you remember john do take a oath 
never again to seek Matilda love 

o what be he that be swear affection slave 
that will not violate all law all oath 
And be mighty what will he omit 
to compass his intent though never so ill 
you must suppose king Richard now be dead 
and john resistless be fair England lord 
who strive to forget Matilda love 
take to his wife the beauteous Isabella 
betroth to Hugh de briu earl of north march 
and pick quarrel under show of kin 
whole divorce his first queen away 
but yet Matilda still still trouble he 
and be in the court so oft he court she 
that by her noble father old Fitzwater 
she be remove from his lusttempting eye 
but tide restrain overswell their bound with rage 
her absence add more fuel to his fire 
in sleep he see she and his wake thought 
study by day to compass his desire 

friar since now you speak of vision 
it be receive by tradition 
from those that be right near unto king john 
of three strange vision that to he appear

and there king john sit sleep in his chair 

ambition that have ever wait on king john 
now bring he Austria easy to be take 
be whole tame by Richard warlike hand 
and bid he add that dukedom to his crown 
but he put by ambition and contemn 
all other kingdom but the english crown 
which he hold fast as if he will not lose 

the lady and the child that do ascend 
strive in vain to take the crown from john 
be Constance and her son the duke of Britain 
heir to the elder brother of the king 
yet he sleep on and with a little spurn 
the mother and the prince do overturn 
again when insurrection they assist 
stir by the french king and the wrong earl 
who trothplight wife king john have take to wife 
he only clap his hand upon his sword 
mock their threaten and in their attempt 
the harmless prince receive recureless death 
who they too late with bootless tear lament 

Matilda stay Matilda do but speak 
who be there entreat Matilda to come back 

who will you have my lord 

why my lord Bonville I will have Matilda 
that but even now pass by towards the door 

I see she not my lord

a gnat a moat a shadow thou will spy 
come follow i she can be so far 
but I shall overtake she come away 

the last appearance shadow the fair queen 
and her two child at who sight king john 
show neither sign nor show of passion 
but when the sun come mask in a cloud 
and veil beauty join with chastity 
appear in Matilda lovely shape 
he start he clasp he wake he call he seek 
the shadow of that substance he affect 
to she he sew but she his suit reject 
to he she sew but he she suit neglect 
he sue to be her love she do despise 
she sue to live a maid which he deny 
what follow of this wilful will and shall 
this no and nay this quenchless bootless fire 
this cold affection and this hot desire 
the act itself shall tell and the poor friar 
your partial favour humble do require 

now I perceive this only be a dream 
divine Matilda angel do appear 
deck like a vestal ready for heaven choir 
and to this earthly trunk will not come near 
well let she go I must i'faith I must 
and so I will king thought shall be divine 
so be Matilda so henceforth shall i 

so do peace shall wait upon your crown 
and blessing upon blessing shall befall 

its true my lord I know full well there shall 

your people will wax proud of such a king 
that of himself be king lord of his thought 
which by assertion of philosopher 
be hold to be the great empery 

and they say wise noble Anbery 

then will Fitzwater with his gallant troop 
again keep triumph in the english court 
then will Matilda 

Matilda what of she 

like a bright star adorn the lovely train 
of beauteous lady which attend the queen 
who only beauty equal they all 

like a old fool who dim eye want sight 
compare the sun to common candle light 

pardon my liege I do confess her fair 
exceed all these as far as day do night 

gross allude night by moon by star 
by wander fire exhale meteor 
by artificial light by eye of beast 
and little glowworm glimpse in the dark 
have somewhere brightness lightness and sometime 
under each horizon in all part clear 
but they at no time nowhere can be say 
to be less dark than dungeon darkness be 
pitch colour ebony face black than black 
while her fair eye give beauty to bright day 

to hear the queen thus praise work my content 

the queen o have I such a thought I will repent 

further my lord

to curtail his good work that seem so long

that in your court be suffer hourly 
and bid you punish ruffian with long hair 
new fashion and such toy a special care 
have that good man he turn the statute book 
about his hall and chamber if you look

and yet I can choose but love eternal 
this wanton king replete with cruelty 
oh how be all his princely virtue stain

which kindle first to fire now in a flame 
show to the whole world clear his foul shame 
to quench this flame full many a tide of tear 
like overflow full sea have be spend 
and many a dry land drink with humane blood 
yet nothing help his passion violent 
rather they add oil to his rage fire 
heat to his heat desire to his desire 
somewhat I fear be now a manage 
for that prodigious bloody stigmatic 
be never call unto his kingly sight 
but like a comet he portend still 
some innovation or some monstrous act 
cruel unkindly horrid full of hate 
as that vile deed at Windsor do of late 
gentle Matilda somewhat I mistrust 
yet thou I need not fear such be his love 
again the place do give thou warrantise 
yet I remember when his highness say 
the lustful monk of Bury shall he aid 
I so it be if she have any ill 
through the lewd shaveling will her shame be wrought 
if it so chance Matilda guiltless wrong 
will with the loss of many a life be buy 
but Hubert will be still his dread lord friend 
however he deserve his master serve 
though he neglect he will not I neglect 
whoever fail he I will john affect 
for though king fault in many a foul offence 
subject must sue not mend with violence 

now by my faith you be too blame madam

bring a signet from my lord the king 
and this commission sign with his hand 
command i as the content express 
that I shall present deliver up 
the lady bruise and her young son to he 

what time a day be this

but do you dine 

the lady and her son do not 
brand will not stay 

no Leicester no for here be no such sign 
of any meat digesture 

but by the way tell we I pray you blunt 
while she remain with you be she distraught 
with grief or any other passion violent 

she now and then will weep and often pray 
for reconcilement betwixt the king and lord 

How to her son do she affect stand 

affection can not any more affect 
nor may a mother show more mother love 

How to my lord the king 

o my lord God I never know a subject love king more 
she never will blind tell how his grace 
save her young son from soldier and from fire 
how fair he speak give she her son to keep 
and then poor lady she will kiss her boy 
pray for the king so hearty earnest 
that in pure zeal she weep most bitter 

I weep for she and do by heaven protest 
I honour Bruse wife however that slave 
rude effect what I rash wild 
yet when he come again and I bethink 
what bitter penance I have put they to 
for my conceive displeasure against old Bruse 
I have the villain post and bear they meat 
which he excuse protest pity move he 
to leave wine bread and other powder meat 
more than they twain can in a fortnight eat 

indeed this can I witness with the king 
which argue in that point his innocence 
brand do bear in a month provision 
but lock it like a villain far from they 
and lock they in a place where no man ear 
may hear their lamentable woeful move 
for all the issue both of vent and light 
come from a louvre at the tower top 
till now lord bruise make open this wide gap 

have I not reason think you to make wide 
the window that shall let so much woe forth 
where sit my mother martyr by herself 
hope to save her child from martyrdom 
where stand my brother martyr by himself 
because he will not taste his mother blood 
for thus I gather this my mother tooth and chin 
be bloody with the savage cookery 
which her soft heart through pity of her son 
respectless make her practice on herself 
and her right hand with offer it the child 
be with her own pure blood stain and defile 
my little brother lip and chin alone 
be taint with the blood but his even tooth 
like orient pearl or snowwhite ivory 
have not one touch of blood one little spot 
which be a argument the boy will not 
once stir his lip to taste that bloody food 
our cruel gentle mother minister 
but as it seem for see his pretty 
palm be bloody too he cast it on the ground 
for on this side these bless relic lie 
by famine rage divide from this shrine 
sad woeful mother in jerusalem 
who when thy son and thou do faint for food 
bury his sweet flesh in thy hungry womb 
how merciless be thou if we compare 
thy fact and this for my poor lady mother

but when he see my mother bend to die 
he die with she oh childish valiancy 

good Bruse have do my heart can not contain 
the grief it hold my eye must shower down rain
