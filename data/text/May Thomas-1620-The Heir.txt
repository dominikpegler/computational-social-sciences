Eugenio sister then be the rich heir 
by his decease 

yes and the fair one too 
she need no gloss that fortune can set on she 
her beauty of itself be prize enough 
to make a king turn beggar for 

Hoy day 
what in love Clerimont I lay my life it be so 
thou can not praise she with such passion else 

I know not but I sleep well enough last night 
but if thou see she once I will not give 
a farthing for thy life I tell thou Philocles 
one fight of she will make thou cry ay i 
sigh and look pale methinks I do imagine 
how like a idolatrous lover thou will look 
through the eyelid know nobody 

it be very well but how do your worship escape 
you have see she 

true but I have a 
antidote and I can teach it thou 

when 
I have need on it I will desire it 

and it will 
be worth thy learning when thou shall see the 
tyranny of that same scurvy boy and what fool 
he make of we shall I describe the beast 

what beast 

a lover 

do 

then to be brief I will pass over the opinion of your ancient father as likewise those strange love speak of in the authentic history of chivalry Amadis du Gaul parismus the knight of the sun or the witty knight don Quixote de la Mancha where those brave man neither enchantment giant windmill nor flock of sheep can vanquish be make the trophy of triumph love 

prithee come to the matter 

neither will I mention the complaint of sir Guy for the fair Phelis nor the travel of parismus for the love of the beauteous Laurana nor last the most sad penance of the ingenious knight don Quixote upon the mountain of sierra Morenna move by the unjust disdain of the lady Dulcinea del Toboso 〈◊〉 or our modern author I will not so much as name they no not that excellent treatise of Tully love write by the master of art 

I will thou will pass over this pass over of author and speak thy own judgement 

why then to be brief I think a lover look like a ass 

I can describe he better than so myself he look like a man that have sit up at card all night or a stale drunkard waken in the midst of his sleep 

but Philocles I will not have thou see this lady she have a bewitch look 

how dare thou venture man what strange medicine have thou find Ovid near teach it thou I doubt I guess thy remedy for love go to a bawdy house or so be it not 

faith and that be a good way I can tell you we young brother be behold to it alas we must not fall in love and choose who we like best we have no jointure for they as you bless heir can have 

well I have find you sir and prithee tell i how got thou wench 

why I can want no pander I lie in the constable house 

and there you may whore by authority

that thou so praise be some ill favour wench 
who thou will have i laugh at for commend

I will show you she 

how can thou do it

a deadly enemy nor be his house 
open to any of our kindred 

that be no matter

and my back window look into his garden 
there every morning fair Leucothoe 
for so I hear she name walk alone 
to please her sense make Aurora blush 
to see on bright than her soft appear

impudent rascal can look i in the face 
and know how thou have wrong i thou have 
dishonour my daughter make a whore on she

but if you please it may be yet close up 
without dishonour I will marry she

sir I be poor I must confess 
fortune have bless you better but I swear 
by all thing that can bind it be not your wealth 
be the foundation of my true build love

all other woman fortune and themselves 
and be I great as great as I can wish 
myself for her advancement no such bar 
as fortune inequality shall stand 
betwixt our love

that lose himself by love of himself 
who view in affair and crystal stream 
those lip that only he can never kiss 
dote on the shadow which to reach in vain 
strive he drown thus scorn all beside 
for the love shadow the fair substance die 

fie fie I like not these impossible tale 
a man to fall in love with his own shadow 
and die for love it be most ridiculous 

madam I know not I have often see 
both man and woman court the look glass 
with so much seem contentation 
that I can think this true nay wear it about they 
as lover do their mistress counterfeit 

that be not for love but to correct their beauty 
and draw from other admiration 
for all the comfort that our face give 
unto ourselves be but reflection 
of that fair like that another take 

I will we be a little near they 
we may but hear what talk these wench have 
when they be alone I warrant some good stuff 

it be happiness enough for i to see 
the motion of her lip 

i'faith be it thereabouts 
why Philocles what lose already man 
strike dead with one poor glance look up for shame 
and tell i how thou like my judgement now 
now thou do see 

ah Clerimont too well

I must be she or else I must not be 

contain that passion that will else overwhelm 
all virtue in you all that be call man 
and shall be you take my advice my heart 
my life to second you let we consult 
you may find time to speak to she and woe she 

May nay I will in spite of destiny 
let woman and faint heart fool complain

dare show itself and press to his desire 
through thick troop of horrid opposite 
be there a thousand wake dragon set 
to keep that golden fruit I will attempt 
to pluck and taste it it be the danger crown 
a brave achievement what if I shall go 
and bold woo she in her father house 
in spite enmity what can they say 

it be madness that not wisdom rash attempt 
betray the mean but never work the end 

she will not hate a man for love she 
or if she do better be once deem 
then live for ever hapless 

but take time 
the second thought our wise man say be best

I will I do not he may spare his pain 
and that unusual cost that he bestow 
in prank up himself and please i better

to answer your kind letter and express 
what you desire she shall then send it bold

I have see some of his profession 
out of case as plain as clear as day 
to our weak judgement and no doubt at first 
mean like our thought by those that make the law 
pick out such hard inextricable doubt 
that they have spin a suit of seven year long 
and lead their hood wink client in a wood 
a most irremovable labyrinth 
till they have quite consume they this they can do 
in other case why not as well in this 
I have see other can extend the law 
upon the wrack or cut it short again 
to their own private profit as that thief 
cruel Procrustes serve his hapless guest 
to fit they to his bed well I shall see

for some rich gripe landlord you can grin 
the face of his poor tenant stretch the law 
to serve his turn and guide by his angel 
speak oracle more than the tongue of man 
than you can find exception reservation 
stand at a word a syllable a letter

so charitable as this you can find nothing 
I shall for ever hate all your profession 

I do beseech your highness to excuse i 
I can do more than your law will let i 
nor falsify my knowledge nor my conscience
