but we will willing have your lordship take 
notice when we express our heart to serve you

and talk as you have but start from a dream 
I dare not be too bold to inquire the cause 
but your face will teach other melancholy 

now in this general mirth it must appear 
the great wonder to behold your trouble 

I shall betray myself keep in my passion 

there be something in it more than we apprehend 

what shall distract the freedom of your sole 
kinsman and only favourite to the duke 
the people love too and these seldom meet 
the minion of the soldier who honour you 
most infinite for your valour and your bounty 

flatter not gentleman 

I will be your hind first 
eclipse not sir the glory of your mind 
with this strange melancholy I will not for 
my hope the duke shall see this dulness he 
may with unhappy jealousy interpret

now joy revel in the court 
by his command and his example too 
do not affront his pleasure I be bold

and you may give it pardon 

I must thank

you will pardon the folly on it 

what be it be clear with i 

be you not in love my lord 

in love 

I have shrewd conjecture 

from what 

from these dull symptom if you be 

what then 

let i be your physician it be a woman 
I must presume 

what do a man love else 

there be those man be in love with their own clothes 
their wit their folly their estate themselves 
but if you love a woman let i advise you 

hear he my lord his practice upon that sex 
have make he learn 

Something I have observe 
after a hundred mistress I have be dull else 
but to the point 

how will you advise i 

I will not counsel you not to love at all 
as some that be all satyr against the sex 
love i a handsome lady but so love she 
that still your heart find room for a fresh beauty 
for twenty for a thousand 

be inconstancy 
so easy and so pardonable 

why do you shift 
your shirt the linen be fine but not so clean 
and sweet after a journey it be a justice 
to change and a security a woman 
be tyrant when she find a dotage love 
but wise to delight our heart not ruin they 
with too severe impression 

prithee tell i 
what do most man desire that be in love 

in this wise love I mean why my lord they 
desire to enjoy their mistress what else 
can be expect and it be necessary 
in my opinion 

have thou be woman 
thou will not have be so cruel 

troth my lord 
I know not how the sex may have corrupt i 
but have I be Adonis without question 
my lady Venus shall have have no cause 
to accuse my bashfulness I shall have leave 
the forest to have hunt 

I believe it 

but I must be content 

nothing will much trouble thy head Valerio 

I do not vex myself with much inquiry 
what man do in the Indies or what trade 
the great Turk be on nor what his design be 
nor do the state at home much trouble i 
after the war I enjoy my limb and can 
boast some activity until some woman 
in kindness take i down be rule by i 
employ your spring and youth upon those joy 
they be fit for beget a new Elysium 
under some please shade let we lie and laugh 
our temple crown with rose with the choice 
and rich blood of grape quicken our vein 
some fair cheek boy skink our swell cup 
and we with jovial soul shoot they round 
at each man lip a mistress 

I do look for this before 

they in this bower 
shall with their song and music charm our ear 
and nimble dance their bright hair loose spread 
nor shall they more their amorous beauty hide 
then those contend for the golden ball 

thou will imagine many fine device 
but after all these pleasure as there be 
a limit and a period set what will 
succeed these rapture when they be past enjoy 
but leave so many sting upon our thought 

we will think of that or if we do 
we will venture upon fortune courtesy 

thou be resolute Valerio if ere sorrow 
lay siege to i I will wish thou my companion 

I be your humble creature and shall be honour 
in your command

of her attendance but not serve she with 
half the devotion I will pay Euphemia

my hope grow from her misery which may 
incline Euphemia to pity i 
I must use art 

good madam have more comfort

most black and ominous here be a change of state 
no noise of waiter and officious troop 
of courtier futter here where be the train 
of lady with more blossom than the spring 
ambitious to present their duty to she 
where be those jewel who proud blaze do use 
to vie with sunbeam and strike gazer blind 
all go behind a cloud how she observe 
the structure which more soft than Dionisio 
seem to incline their marble head and sweat 
in the compassion of her injury 
my heart be labour for breath and yet 
I dare not speak to she the duke have spy 
upon she and his anger carry ruin 

sure I shall know this place

compose himself to please the duke who creature

that cowardly will shake that comely building 
make for your happiness some lament your fate 
who look speak mirth be confident the duke 
will chide the unlawful flame that like rude 
and wander meteor lead he from your virtue 
with so much danger to embrace Ardelia 

the duke shall know your compliment 

no more lest for your charity to i 
for I must call it so you ruin not 
your favour with the duke farewell Leontio 
yet I will pray one favour from you 

i 
my life be your servant 

if you hear the duke 
speak of i as I fear he never will 
but in displeasure tell he I will think it

rather than let i draw a wretched breath 
with general scorn let he command i dead 
and I forgive he otherwise farewell 

that close show something like a will to be

Strozzi gentleman but she appear 
for who the world shall wear eternal shive 
bright Ardelia queen of love and i 

the only honour my ambition climb too 
be to be hold your highness humble handmaid 

call i thy servant what 
new charm her look do throw upon my soul 

how the duke gaze 

there be some strange divinity within she 
be there not Valerio 

I be not read so far yet as divinity 
i be but humane learning 

speak again 
and at thy lip the quire shall hang to learn 
new tune and the dull sphere but cold imitate 
I be transform with my excess of rapture 
frown frown Ardelia I shall forget 
I be mortal else and when thou have throw down 
thy servant with one smile exalt again 
his heart to heaven and with a kiss breath in i 
another soul fit for thy love but all 
my language be too can and we waste time 
lead on there be something of more ceremony 
expect our presence Italy be barren 
of what we wish to entertain Ardelia 

may all the pleasure think can reach attend you 

be counsel yet without be too ambitious 
to buy a dear repentance 

now we be 
arrive at court shame to our resolution 
I prithee do tempt i to such cowardice 
Horatio I must see she she will not blast we 
she be lovely when our eye salute last 
and at my farewell many innocent tear 
witness her sorrow clear as April weep 
into the bosom of the spring not see 
Ardelia 

you have travel since and she 
want no beauty be not over willing 
to languish in your absence how I pity thou 
but that I will not too much vex your folly 
do think there be faith in any woman eye 
she weep at part a strong obligation 
when they can thread their tear and make a chain 
of water let i wear one of their bracelet 
I will convince thy madness in six word 
admit she say she love you and to your think 
vow it for you say you be contract 
all this be nothing 

no 

not this although 
you have be marry and in the sheet together 
and chaffer earnest for a boy it be nothing 
it bind not 

how 

not with a thousand witness 

how not bind she 

nor any woman live that be possess 
with a wander spirit clap she in a dungeon 
pile three castle on she yet she shall 
break prison when she have but the least mind to it 
she le work through a steelmine to meet a friend 
that she like better with more ease throw up 
a quarry of marble than a mole shall dust 
they work with spirit man and can do wonder 
especial a handsome woman from who false 
and sly temptation all my wit defend i 
there be some deal with a elvish female 
that have but a course face or say but half a one 
enigmatic eye with no more sight than can 
distinguish well man from a horse or bear 
to keep she from mistake in procreation 
a nose of many fashion and as many 
waterwork in they lip of honest hide 
and make to last tooth of a moor complexion 
a chin without all controversy good 
to go a fish with a witch beard on it 
with twenty other commendation such a thing 
be no mischief and a man may trust 
she with no scruple in his conscience 

this be plain madness 

you may call it so 
but I will be bind to travel further with 
this nightmare than the fine flesh and blood 
you court and call your mistress why the devil 
with all his art and malice will never cuckold i 
and I shall leave she in hell and go a journey 
I shall be sure at my return to find her 
safe and untouched sound of her wind and limb 
a fair and handsome woman will not escape so 
you have my opinion now and it be less evil 
to practise it you mind not my instruction 

not I 

these lecture have l read to the city 
with the same success that gentleman may live honest 
and man have luck to father their own child 
but it will not be you be resolve to try it 

be I engage thus far to fall back now 

Remember where you be yet 

I be in the court 

where you expect to compliment with the duke 

what 

what do you think the duke marry 
they say although he love Ardelia 
and without question in these part may want 
no intelligence of your purpose and your person 
and there be no doubt but if he find you quailcatch 
he have power enough to cool your blood and she 
shall she remember what have pass between you 
in that respect be caution do not work 
a double ruin to soothe one vain humour 
eye will beget a appetite of more nearness 
and how that may succeed it be better fear than prove 

I prithee fright i not with shadow 

you be then for her substance I will not leave you 

I will see she do the duke proclaim it death 

I have rather see the cow with her five leg 
and all the monster in the market then 
be trouble with the spectacle but on 
stay yet will you but see she will her face content you 
afar off without multiply twinkle 
ridiculous sigh or cross arm pinion thus 
as the knighttemplar leg be whole bury 
like tailor no deject look as you have 
your father alive again to send you out 
to sea with pension to maintain you in biscuit 
poor John and half a livery which shall be 
part of your governor to read moral virtue 
and lenten lecture to you or if she frown 
as much as say my friend I be not for you 
the duke the better gentleman and shall pay for it 
will you return then with a handsome patience 
and wise love where no man else will rival you 
a witch or some old woman 

I prithee leave 
thy frenzy thou shall witness I will be temperate 
who be this signior Valerio

I hope you will not betray i 

This the form 
of your revenge 

my fair Ardelia

Come madam

contempt of so much beauty

and duty to the altar of your merit 
these drop be pale and poor speak my heart 
which shall dissolve into a purple flood 
and drown this little island in your service

o do not hide that beauty shall repair 
what my love to it have decay within i 
for I must say I love although you kill 
my ambition with a frown and with one angry 
lightning shoot from your eye turn i to ash 

good heaven 

I know what you will urge against i

and wound my obedience that I be 
false to the duke the trust impose upon i

a star on who the other emulous light 
look pale and waste their envy I confess 
I have not in the stock of my desert

yet after all wish destiny command 
the poor Leontio to love Euphemia 

what do I hear consider sir again 

I have have contention with my blood and force 
nature retire and tremble with the guilt 
of her proud thought seek to make escape 
through some ungentle breach make by our conflict 
but no prevail against love and fate 
which both decree i lose without your mercy 
o bid i live who but in your acceptance 
shall groan away my breath and whither till 
I turn my own sad monument 

no more 
be it possible new misery shall overtake 
Euphemia o my lord I with what offence 
have I deserve after my weight of sorrow 
your wound upon my honour call again 
your noble thought and let i not reply 
to your unjust desire if I must answer they

Scolopendra I have read of she what kin be she 
to the serpent with a hundred leg 

I know not 
but she be cousingerman to the salamander 
she be a cookmaid once so enure to fire 
and tough the flame of hell will hardly scorch she 

a admirable dragon can she speak 
will she not spit fire if I shall salute she 
I will venture 

he have preservative 
against the odour of her lung 

he have need 
of fortification for his eye 

not all 
the spice in Arabia be like 
her breath 

o sir believe it right Styx most pure Avernus 

sir i do never see a gentleman 
who I do wish more hearty my husband 

to beget scorpion on she 

thank thou my precious Scolopendra but 
I have a kind of fear thou wot be unconstant 
shall no man get thou from i here be a face 
be worth my jealousy and who look upon it 
but with my eye will be as mad as I be 

the needle not more constant to the north 

but for all that the needle waver 
I will be certain 

they conspire to wrong i 
I fear he be take with her more deformity 
will you forsake i servant 

hum off 
and give my eye play further yet your shadow 
be yet too near my judgement be confound 
consider one thing with another they be both 
such matchless toad I know not which to choose 
you have a excellent eye but there be a pearl 
in she no goldsmith know the value on it 

observe the colour in my eye 

you be right madam 
as many and more bright than those in the rainbow 
delightful as the parrot plume but then 
her forehead 

so like a promontory or 

a field of honeysuckle and poppyflower 
embroider with daisy and emboss 
with yellowwart which like to molehill swell 

where many emmet hunt and sport themselves 
in the sun till to her hair a quick set hedge 
in the evening they retire 

but betwixt her eye 
you may discern a forest some high timber 
be so well grow that fashion on the top 
with scissors and cut point like a pyramid 
the world will take she for a unicorn 

good beetlebrow 

sir you must be my champion 

examine but this nose 

I have a toter 

which place with symmetry be like a fountain 
in the middle of her face distil rheum 
and at two spout do water all her garden 

but here be one soft as it be compose of wax 

a nose of wax 

it will melt present 

not stubborn but submit to any shape 
she will put upon it round flat when she be please 
she can extend and hang it with such art 
over her mouth that when she gape into 
the sun and show her tooth you will imagine 
you see a perfect dial in her chap 
to tell you what o'clock it be than her lip 

I see not so much red there as will make 
a dominical letter look upon these cheek 

I never paint sir 

here be red enough 

which hideous dispose and mix with black 
the ground of her complexion will mortify 
the most unnatural concupiscence 
while her cheek represent in curious landscape 
Gomorrah and her sister Sodom burn 

that comparison be home 

but she have a breath 
a more preservative than mithridate 

but with one kiss she will preserve you from 
the infection and with strong force repel 
the poison of the air 

I thank you sir 
I have a strong breath indeed 

when she be move 
she will kill you with her phlegm fourscore point blank 
the innocent part of it will stain a marble 
let i alone to commend thou 

she carry not destruction like my tongue 
employ upon thy enemy Horatio

and that which be the rank part of my life 
my blood be meet withal and it be my wonder

so much black sin be wont to bathe itself 
I will look up and beg with my best strength

shut up the gate 
and plant a strong guard round about the palace 
let none go forth in pain of death the devil 
shall obscure he here with his black wing 
though he rob hell to cover we with darkness 
we will find he under twenty fog and drag he 
to his just torment 

you be he pious successor 

it be do and my ambition be satisfy 
contain my heart but to which bold assassinate 
Pallante or Bentivolio must I owe 
this bloody service 

I have do it my lord 

soft thou be my brave and glorious villain 

there have be better title sir bestow 
on man of my desert the kill of 
my lawful prince have be esteem a act 
above the reward of villain though I know 
I be one and a monstrous villain too 
I will not be call so 

thou shall it divide 
title with i do think I will not reward it 
thou be sad 

I be a little melancholy 
after my work 

do thou repent thy service 

be he alive I will kill he again for you 
it be not his death that haunt my conscience 
but the condition and state he die in 
that trouble i 

what state or what condition 

when I have teach he to believe he be not 
long live and that your lordship have by i 
send he a writ of ease for I will make short 

do thou discover i 

why not I be 
to take a order he shall never reveal it 
upon the mention of your name my lord 
he fetch a sigh I think will have prevent 
my execution on his heart as if 
that be a great wound than death upon he 
but I who resolute soul be deaf to his prayer 
bathe in as many tear as will have wrought 
a marble to compassion bid he choose 
the humour he will die in and collect 
some thought to wait upon he to eternity 
and what do you think he make his choice 

I know not 

to die a honest man no wish to part 
the world with fair Ardelia in his arm and give his ghost up in a wanton kiss 
but with a thousand groan call upon 
Euphemia to forgive he to who virtue 
his soul be go forth to meet and seal 
to it a new and everlasting marriage 
nay he have so much charity to forgive 
you sir and i and will have pray for we 
but that I send the message to his bosom 
that make he quiet and so leave his highness 
have he die obstinate in his sin the wanton 
lascivious duke he live I will not blush for it 

why do relent for this 

I find some mutiny 
in my conscience pray my lord tell i 
do not you wish it be undo 

thou have 
the tremble of a infant it exalt 
my thought to another heaven Pallante thou 
must not leave here but make Leontio owe

the guilt upon himself if both have kill he

shall quick by his death secure thy fate 
put on a cunning face mean time and narrow 
observe the full behaviour of the court 
but special insinuate with the great 
and as they talk of i declare my passion 
and with what horror I receive the death 
of our good duke my pious zeal to appease 
that bless spirit with his murderer blood 
in care to their own head they will proclaim

with my own hand to be revenge upon thou

I do suspect that voice have not my confidence 
of thy most certain death betray i thus 
I will have make sure work some fate direct 
his sword through both our heart 

no treason treason 

so let i employ the short breath that remain 
to tell you I engage Pallante to 
the duke death with a full hope to satisfy 
lust and ambition but he juggle with i 
and so have Bentivolio though he be 
with his Ardelia in prison for 
acknowledge himself your murderer 
to which Valerio and myself inflame he 

Valerio traitor too 

sir he be slay 
his wound body find in Ardelia chamber 

Ardelia 
this dark mischief shall be clear 
Strozzi command Bentivolo 
and Ardelia be instant bring hither 

I shall sir 

most ingrateful Leonato 

I know I be not worth your charity 
and yet my lord your cruelty upon 
Euphemia and some licence I take from 
the example of your wanton blood be ground 
of these misfortune it seem you be reconcile 
be worth her love hereafter thou be just 
Pallante be still faithful to thy prince 
I beg your general pardon 

we forgive thou 

heaven be a great way of and I shall be 
ten thousand year in travel yet it be happy 
if I may find a lodging there at last 
though my poor soul get thither upon crutch 
it can stay farewell again forgive i 

he be dead 

I pity he 

the prisoner wait 

admit they 
be your life so great a burden 
that you upon the rumour of our murder 
will take the act upon you though you have 
promise to be the traitor or do you 
envy another man shall own the glory 
and title of our bloody executioner 

ay but confess the guilt I then believe 

this be a mystery 

I can best clear it 

it be my wonder how 
Valerio be slay 

that I must answer 
although my sword then promise to another 
revenge yet in the wound he meet a justice 
I now repent not 

what be that gentleman 

I be one madam that do court my friend here 
so well that though he be in fair election 
to lose his head or to be strangle 
have rather take such as I find with he 
then live to be torment with a woman 

what woman 

any woman without difference 
I have hear your grace have a good fame and though 
it do become your subject to believe it 
I be not bear here madam and I have have 
such ill luck with your sex it do not bind 
my faith it be possible there may be good 
both fair and honest woman but they be never 
under my acquaintance no no yet illfavoured 
in who I only look to find a soul 
but boast my labour this be all truth madam 

his humour make i smile 

enough not only 
our pardon for Valerio death I give 
thou back Ardelia she be my mistress 
but I return her pure as thy own wish 

this grace be mighty sir 

we will see you marry 
and what our person and Euphemia 
can add to grace you 

you have already bless we 
and heaven shower joy upon you 

the next thing be to honour thou Pallante 
thou save my life and do now marry i 
thy faith be not reward 

be my duty 

what be all well again and be she honest 

most innocent 

then she be too good for thou 
come the truth be and now I will speak my conscience 
if there be few good woman in the world 
the fault rise first from one of our own sex 
by flattery in falsehood to deceive they 
and so the punishment do but descend 
to we in justice 

that be some charity 

Come my Euphemia this second knot 
shall be as firm as destiny nor shall 
whatever be to our chaste vow a shame 
in my life after story have a name
