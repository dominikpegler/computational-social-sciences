the time be dull and all that we receive 
will hardly satisfy the day expense

both of the buskined scene and humble stock 
that reign in every noble family 
declaim against we and our amphitheater 
great Pompey work that have give full delight 
both to the eye and ear of fifty thousand 
spectator in one day as if it be 
some unknown desert or great room unpeople

practice in private sport the stew will blush at 
a litter bear by eight liburnian slave 
to buy disease from a glorious strumpet 
the most censorious of our Roman gentry 
nay of the guard robe the senator 
esteem a easy purchase 

yet grudge we 
that with delight join profit and endeavour 
to build their mind up fair and on the stage 
decipher to the life what honour wait 
on good and glorious action and the shame 
that tread upon the heel of vice the salary 
of six sestertij 

for the profit Paris 
and mercenary gain they be thing beneath we 
since while you hold your grace and power with Caesar 
we from your bounty find a large supply 
nor can one thought of want ever approach we 

Oure aim be glory and to leave our name 
to after time 

and will they give we leave 
there end all our ambition 

we have enemy 
and great one too I fear it be give out late 
the consul Aretinus Caesar spy 
say at his table ere a month expire 
for be gall in our last comedy 
he will silence we for ever 

I expect 
no favour from he my strong Aventine be 
that great Domitian who we oft have cheer 
in his most sullen mood will once return 
who can repair with ease the console ruin

the Catti and the Daci and ere long 
the second time will enter Rome in triumph

to appear today in senate

we that have personate in the scene 
the ancient hero and the fall of prince 
with loud applause be to act ourselves 
must do it with undaunted confidence 
whatever our sentence be it be in sport 
and though condemn let we hear it without sorrow 
as if we be to live again tomorrow 

it be speak like yourself 

whether go Paris

I be glad the state be 
so free from matter of more weight and trouble 
that it have vacant time to look on we

and province be determine to descend 
to the censure of a bitter word or jest

be practise everywhere we hardly sleep 
nay can dream with safety all our action 
be call in question to be noble bear 
be now a crime and to deserve too well 
hold capital treason son accuse their father 
father their son and but to win a smile 
from one in grace in court our chaste matron 
make shipwreck of their honour to be virtuous 
be to be guilty they be only safe 
that know to soothe the prince appetite 
and serve his lust 

it be true and it be my wonder 
that two son of so different a nature 
shall spring from good Vespasian we have a Titus 
style just the delight of all mankind 
who do esteem that day lose in his life 
in which some one or other taste not 
of his magnificent bounty one that have 
a ready tear when he be force to sign 
the death of a offender and so far 
from pride that he disdain not the converse 
even of the poor Roman 

yet his brother 
Domitian that now sway the power of thing 
be so incline to blood that no day pass 
in which some be not fasten to the hook 
or throw down from the Gemonies his freeman 
scorn the nobility and he himself 
as if he be not make of flesh and blood 
forget he be a man 

in his young year 
he show what he will be when grow to ripeness 
his great pleasure be be a child 
with a sharp point bodkin to kill fly 
who room now man supply for his escape 
in the vitellian war he raise a temple 
to jupiter and proud place his figure 
in the bosom of the God and in his edict 
he do not blush or start to style himself 
as if the name of emperor be base 
great lord and God Domitian 

I have letter

to enter with all glory the flatter senate 
decree he divine honour and to cross it 
were death with study torment for my part 
I will obey the time it be in vain 
to strive against the torrent 

let we to the curia 
and though unwilling grieve our suffrage 
before we be compel 

and since we can 
with safety use the active let we make use of 
the passive fortitude with this assurance

and you dispose of province to your creature

and hardly dare believe what be assure here 
the mean my good Parthenius that wrought Caesar 
our God on earth to cast a eye of favour 
upon his humble handmaid 

what but your beauty 
when nature frame you for her master piece 
as the pure abstract of all rare in woman

be fire with the relation of your story 
I be reward in the act and happy 
in that my project prosper

and be it in my power I will to be thankful 
if that when I be mistress of myself 
and in my way of youth pure and untainted 
the emperor have vouchsafe to seek my favour 
I have with joy give up my virgin fort 
at the first summons to his soft embrace 
but I be now another not my own 
you know I have a husband for my honour 
I will not be his strumpet and how law 
can be dispense with to become his wife

I can soon resolve it 
when power put in his plea the law be silence 
the world confess one Rome and one Caesar 
and as his rule be infinite his pleasure 
be unconfined this syllable his will

not to be jest with enter Lamia 

as if he dare 
be Caesar rival here he come with ease 
I will remove this scruple 

how so private 
mine own house make a brothel sir how dare you

that be due to she who mighty Caesar favour 
and think what it be to die not to lose time 
she be Caesar choice it be sufficient honour 
you be his taster in this heavenly nectar 
but now must quit the office 

this be rare 
can a man be master of his wife 
because she be young and fair without a patent 
I in my own house be a emperor 
and will defend what be i where be my knave 
if such a insolence escape unpunished

the duty of a husband or that you be mad 
rather than want just cause we will make you so 
dispatch you know the danger else deliver it 
nay on your knee madam you now be free

as wanton Helen bring to he of Troy Exit 

father conscript may this our meeting be 
happy to Caesar and the common wealth 

silence 

the purpose of this frequent senate 
be first to give thanks to the god of Rome 
that for the propagation of the empire 
vouchsafe we one to govern it like themselves 
in height of courage depth of understanding 
and all those virtue and remarkable grace 
which make a prince most eminent our Domitian 
transcend the ancient roman I can never 
bring his praise to a period what good man 
that be a friend to truth dare make it doubtful 
that he have Fabius staidness and the courage 
of bold Marcellus to who Hannibal give 
the style of target and the sword of Rome 
but he have more and every touch more Roman 
as Pompey dignity Augustus state 
Antony bounty and great julius fortune 
with Cato resolution I be lose 
in the ocean of his virtue in a word 
all excellency of good man in he meet 
but no part of their vice 

this be no flattery 

take heed you will be observe 

it be then most fit 
that we as to the father of our country 
like thankful son stand bind to pay true service 
for all those blessing that he shower upon we 
shall not connive and see his government 
deprave and scandalize by mean man 
that to his favour and indulgence owe 
themselves and be

to the plebeian 

if I free not myself 
and in myself the rest of my profession 
from these false imputation and prove 
that they make that a libel which the poet 
write for a comedy so act too 
it be but justice that we undergo 
the heavy censure 

be you on the stage 
you talk so bold 

the whole word be one 
this place be not exempt and I be 
so confident in the justice of our cause 
that I can wish Caesar in who great name 
all king be comprehend sit as judge 
to hear our plea and then determine of we 
if to express a man sell to his lust 
waste the treasure of his time and fortune 
in wanton dalliance and to what sad end 
a wretch that be so give over do arrive at

from such licentious course lay open

of prodigal strumpet can deserve reproof 
why be not all your golden principle

to choose fair virtue for our guide not pleasure

if any in this reverend assembly 
nay even yourself my lord that be the image

let these who this victorious arm have make 
the scorn of fortune and the slave of Rome 
taste the extreme of misery bear they off 
to the common prison and there let they prove 
how sharp our axe be 

a bloody entrance 

to tell you you be happy in your prince 
be to distrust your love or my desert 
and either be distasteful or to boast 
how much not by my deputy but myself

his clemency to my weakness and if ever 
I do abuse it lightning strike i dead

yes sir with much grief 
to see he as he be can nothing work he 
to be himself 

o Paris it be a weight 
sit heavy here and can this right hand loss 
remove it it shall off but he be deaf 
to all persuasion 

sir with your pardon 
I will offer my advice I once observe 
in a tragedy of we in which a murder 
be act to the life a guilty hearer 
force by the terror of a wound conscience 
to make discovery of that which torture 
can not wring from he nor can it appear 
like a impossibility but that 
your father look on a covetous man 
present on the stage as in a mirror 
may see his own deformity and loathe it 
now can you but persuade the emperor 
to see a comedy we have that be style 
the cure of avarice and to command 
your father to be a spectator of it 
he shall be so anatomise in the scene 
and see himself so personate the baseness 
of a self torture miserable wretch 
true describe that I much hope the object 
will work compunction in he 

there be your fee 
I never buy better counsel be you in readiness 
I will effect the rest 

sir when you please 
we will be prepare to enter sir the emperor Exit Paris 

repine at we 

it be more or my informer 
that keep strict watch upon he be deceive 
in their intelligence there be a list 
of malcontent as junius Rusticus 
Palphurius Sura and this Aelius Lamia 
that murmur at your triumph as mere pageant 
and at their midnight meeting tax your justice 
for so I style what they call tyranny 
for Paetus Thrasea death as if in he 
virtue herself be murder nor forget they 
Agricola who for his service do 
in the reduce Brittany to obedience 
they dare affirm to be remove with poison 
and he compel to write you a coheir 
with his daughter that his testament may stand 
which else you have make void then your much love 
to julia your niece censure as incest 
and do in scorn of Titus your dead brother 
but the divorce Lamia be force to sign 
to she you honour with Augusta title 
be only name they do conclude there be 
a Lucrece once a Collatine and a Brutus 
but nothing roman leave now but in you 
the lust of Tarquin 

yes his fire and scorn 
of such as think that our unlimited power 
can be confine dare Lamia pretend 
a interest to that which I call i 
or but remember she be ever his 
that be now in our possession fetch he hither the guard go of 
I will give he cause to wish he rather have 
forget his own name then ever mention she 
shall we be circumscribe let such as can 
by force make good their action though wicked 
conceal excuse or qualify their crime 
what our desire grant leave and privilege to 
though contradict all divine decree 
or law confirm by Romulus and Numa

so you preserve your power 
as you shall equal and omnipotent here 
with Jupiter above Parthenius kneel whisper to Caesar 

thy suit be grant 
whatever it be Parthenius for thy service 
do to Augusta only so a trifle 
command he hither if the comedy fail 
to cure he I will minister something to he 
that shall instruct he to forget his gold 
and think upon himself 

may it succeed well 
since my intent be pious Exit Parthenius 

we be resolve 
what course to take and therefore Aretinus 
inquire no far go you to my empress 
and say I do entreat for she rule he 
who all man else obey she will vouchsafe 
the music of her voice at yonder window 
when I advance my hand thus I will blend exit Aretinus 
my cruelty with some scorn or else it be lose 
revenge when it be unexpected fall 
with great violence and hate clothe in smile 
strike and with horror dead the wretch that come not 
prepare to meet it our good Lamia welcome enter Lamia with the guard 
so much we owe you for a benefit 
with willingness on your part confer upon we 
that it be our study we that will not live 
engage to any for a courtesy 
how to return it 

it be beneath your fate 
to be oblige that in your own hand grasp 
the mean to be magnificent 

Well put off 
but yet it must not do the empire Lamia 
divide equal can hold no weight 
if balance with your gift in fair Domitia

of melt nectar I taste from her lip 
but yield a touch of immortality 
to the bless receiver every grace and feature 
prize to the worth buy at a easy rate 
if purchase for a consulship her discourse 
So ravish and her action so attractive 
that I will part with all my other sense 
provide I may ever see and hear she 
the pleasure of her bed I dare not trust 
the wind or air with for that will draw down 
in envy of my happiness a war 
from all the god upon i 

your compassion 
to i be your forbear to insult 
on my calamity which you make your sport 
will more appease those god you have provoke 
then all the blasphemous comparison 
you sing unto her praise 

I sing her praise 
it be far from my ambition to hope it music above and a song 
it be a debt she only can lay down 
and no tongue else discharge hark I think prompt 
with my consent that you once more shall hear she 
she do begin a universal silence 
dwell on this place it be death with linger torment 
to all that dare disturb she who can hear this the song end Caesar go on 
And fall not down and worship in my fancy 
Apollo be judge on Latino hill 
fair haired Calliope on her ivory lute 
but something short of this sing Ceres praise 
and grisly Pluto rape on Proserpina 
the motion of the sphere be out of time 
her musical note but hear say Lamia say 
be not her voice angelical 

to your ear 
but I alas be silent 

be so ever 
that without admiration can hear she 
malice to my felicity strike thou dumb 
and in thy hope or wish to repossess 
what I love more than empire I pronounce thou 
guilty of treason off with his head do you stare

to she be more true liberty then to live 
parthian or asian queen as lesser star 
that wait on Phoebe in her full of brightness 
compare to she you be thus I seat you 
by Caesar side command these that once 
be the adore glory of the time 
to witness to the world they be your vassal 
at your foot to attend you

and not my pride and yet when I consider 
that I be you all duty they can pay 
I do receive as circumstance due 
to she you please to honour 

Caesar will 
command you hither nor must you gainsay it 

lose time to see a interlude must I pay to

my torment then the better 

can it be 
this sordid thing Parthenius be thy father

the fiction for impossible in the scene 
have I not see the substance sirrah sit still 
and give attention if you but nod

and all the ceremony proper to our self 
and come to the last act there where the cure 
by the doctor be make perfect the swift minute

from my embrace my desire increase 
as they be satisfy all pleasure else

o master doctor he be past recovery 
a lethargy have cease he and however 
his sleep resemble death his watchful care 
to guard that treasure he dare make no use of

what be that he hold 
so fast between his tooth 

the key that open 
his iron chest cram with accurse gold 
rusty with long imprisonment there be no duty 
in i his son nor confidence in friend 
that can persuade he to deliver up

and when devotion call he to the temple 
of Mammon who of all the god he kneel to

or will he though the wealth of Rome be pawn 
for the restore of it for one short hour 
be win to part with it 

still still myself 
and if like i he love his gold no pawn 
Is good security 

I will try if I can force it 
it will not be his avaritious mind 
like man in river drown make he gripe fast 
to his last gasp what he in life hold dear 
and if that it be possible in nature 
will carry it with he to the other world 

as I will do to hell rather than leave it

or to himself or other for which wise man 
desire to live you may with safety pinch he 
or under his nail stick needle s yet he stir not 
anxious fear to lose what his soul dote on 
render his flesh insensible we must use 
some mean to rouse the sleep faculty 
of his mind there lay the lethargy take a trumpet 
and blow it into his ear it be to no purpose 
the roar noise of thunder can wake he 
and yet despair not I have one trick yet leave

I will cause a fearful dream 
to steal into his fancy and disturb it 
with the horror it bring with it and so free

great princess though I presume to tell you 
waste your time in childish lamentation 
you do degenerate from the blood you spring from

which mercy can pardon but you will say

to who or custom or example make 
grim death appear less terrible I dare die 
to do you service in a fair revenge 
and it will better suit your birth and honour 
to fall at once than to live ever slave 
to his proud empress that insult upon 
your patient suffering Say but you go on 
and I will retch his heart or perish in 
the noble undertake 

your free offer 
confirm your thankfulness which I acknowledge 
a satisfaction for a great debt 
then what you stand engage for but I must not 
upon uncertain ground hazard so grateful 
and good a servant the mortal power 
protect a prince though sell to impious act 
and seem to slumber till his roar crime 
awake their justice but then look down 
and with impartial eye on his contempt 
of all religion and moral goodness 
they in their secret judgement do determine 
to leave he to his wickedness which sink he 
when he be most secure 

his cruelty 
increase daily of necessity 
must render he as odious to his soldier

we can whisper 

I be still prepare 
to execute when you please to command i 
since I be confident he deserve much more

than he that save a citizen 

o here be Caenis enter Caenis 

whence come you 

from the empress who seem move 
in that you wait no better her pride be grow 
to such a height that she disdain the service 
of her own woman and esteem herself 
neglect when the princess of the blood 
on every course employment be not ready 
to stoop to her command 

where be her greatness 

where you will little think she can descend 
to grace the room or person 

speak where be she 

among the player where all state lay by 
she do inquire who act this part who that 
and in what habit blame the tirewoman 
for want of curious dress and so take 
she be with Paris the tragedian shape 
that be to act a lover I think once 
she will have court he 

in the mean time 
how spend the emperor his hour 

as ever 
he have do heretofore in be cruel 
to innocent man who virtue he call crime 
and but this morning if it be possible 
he have outgo himself have condemn 
at Aretinus his informer suit 
Palphurius Sura and good junius Rusticus 
man of the best repute in Rome for their 
integrity of life no fault object 
but that they do lament his cruel sentence 
on Paetus Thraseas the philosopher 
their patron and instructor 

can jove see this 
and hold his thunder 

Nero and Caligula 
command only mischief but our Caesar 
delight to see they 

what we can help 
we may deplore with silence 

we be call for 
by our proud mistress 

we a while must suffer 

it be true fortitude to stand firm against 
all shock of fate when coward faint and die 
in fear to suffer more calamity exeunt 

they be then in fetter 

yes sir but 

but what 
I will have thy thought deliver they 

I shall sir 
but still submit to your godlike pleasure 
which can be instruct 

to the point 

nor let your sacred majesty believe 
your vassal that with dry eye look upon 
his father drag to death by your command 
can pity these that dare presume to censure 
what you decree 

well forward 

it be my zeal 
still to preserve your clemency admire 
temper with justice that embolden i 
to offer my advice Alas I know sir 
these bookman Rusticus and Pulphurius Sura 
deserve all torture yet in my opinion 
they be popular senator and cry up 
with loud applause of the multitude 
for foolish honesty and beggarly virtue 
it will relish more of policy to have they 
make away in private with what exquisite torment 
you please it skill not than to have they draw 
to the degree in public for it be doubt 
that the sad object may beget compassion 
in the giddy rout and cause some sudden uproar 
that may disturb you 

hence pale spirit coward 
can we descend so far beneath ourself 
as or to court the people love or fear 
their worst of hate can they that be as dust 
before the whirlwind of our will and power 
add any moment to we or thou think 
if there be god above or goddess 
but wise Minerva that be i own and sure 
that they have vacant hour to take into 
their serious protection or care 
this many head monster mankind live 
in few as potent monarch and their peer 
and all those glorious constellation 
that do adorn the firmament appoint 
like groom with their bright influence to attend 
the action of king and emperor 
they be the great wheel that move the less 
bring forth those condemn wretch let i see 
one man so lose as but to pity they 
and though there lay a million of soul 
imprison in his flesh my hangman hook 
shall rend it off and give they liberty 
Caesar have say it Exit Parthenius

that with fix eye you careful observe 
the people look charge upon any man 
that with a sigh or murmur do express 
a seem sorrow for these traitor death 
you know his will perform it 

a good bloodhound 
and fit for my employment 

give we leave 
to die fell tyrant 

for beyond our body 
thou have no power 

yes I will afflict your soul 
and force they groan to the Stygian lake 
prepare for such to howl in that blaspheme 
the power of prince that be god on earth 
tremble to think how terrible the dream be 
after this sleep of death 

to guilty man 
it may bring terror not to we that know 
what it be to die well teach by his example 
for who we suffer in my thought I see 
the substance of that pure untainted soul 
of Thraseas our master make a star 
that with melodious harmony invite we 
leave this dunghill Rome make hell by thou 
to trace his heavenly step and fill a sphere 
above yond crystal canopy 

do invoke he 
with all the aid his sanctity of life

live to deride thou our calm patience tread 
upon the neck of tyranny that secure 
as it be a gentle slumber we endure 
thy hangman study torture be a debt 
we owe to grave philosophy that instruct we

I can renew the vigour of my youth 
and be a second Verbius o my glory

all tedious impertinency have contract 
the tragedy into one continue scene 
I have the art of it and be take more 
with my ability that way than all knowledge 
I have but of thy love 

thou be still thyself 
the sweet witty 

when we be abed 
I will thank your good opinion thou shall see 
such a Iphis of thy Paris and to humble 
the pride of Domitilla that neglect i 
however she be your cousin I have force she 
to play the part of Anaxerete 
you be not offend with it 

any thing 
that do content thou yield delight to i 
my faculty and power be thou 

I thank you 
prithee let we take our place bid they enter after a short flourish enter Paris as Iphis 
without more circumstance how do you like 
that shape methinks it be most suitable 
to the aspect of a despair lover 
the seem late fall counterfeit tear 
that hang upon his cheek be my device 

and all be excellent 

now hear he speak 

that she be fair and that a epithet 
too foul to express she or descend noble 
or rich or fortunate and certain truth 
in which poor Iphis glory but that these 
perfection in no other virgin find 
abuse shall nourish cruelty and pride 
in the divine Anaxarete 
be to my lovesick languish soul a riddle 
and with more difficulty to be dissolve 
then that the monster Sphinx from the steepy rock 
offer to Oedipus imperious love 
as at thy ever flame altar Iphis 
thy never tire votary have present 
with scald tear who hecatomb of sigh 
prefer thy power and thy paphian mother 
before the thunderer Neptune or Pluto 
that after Saturn do divide the world 
and have the sway of thing yet be compel 
by thy inevitable shaft to yield 
and sight under thy ensign be auspicious 
to this late trial of my sacrifice 
of love and service 

do he not act it rare 
observe with what a feel he deliver 
his orison to Cupid I be rape with it 

and from thy never empty quiver take 
a golden arrow to transfix her heart 
and force her love like i or cure my wound 
with a leaden one that may beget in i 
hate and forgetfulness of what be now my idol 
but I call back my prayer I have blaspheme 
in my rash wish it be I that be unworthy 
but she all merit and may in justice challenge 
from the assurance of her excellency 
not love but adoration yet bear witness 
all know power I bring along with i 
as faithful advocate to make intercession 
a loyal heart with pure and holy flame 
with the foul fire of lust never pollute 
and as I touch her threshold which with tear 
my limb benumb with cold I oft have wash 
with my glad lip I kiss this earth grow proud 
with frequent favour from her delicate foot 

by Caesar life he weep and I forbear 
hardly to keep he company 

bless ground thy pardon 
if I profane it with forbid step 
I must presume to knock and yet attempt it 
with such a tremble reverence as if

a flinty heart slave he can not use 
one of his form so harsh how the toad swell 
at the other sweet humility

let they proceed 

a rogue part will never leave he 

as you have gentle sir the happiness 
when you please to behold the figure of 
the master piece of nature limn to the life

who call what object have we here 

your cousin keep her proud state still I think 
I have fit she for a part 

do I not charge thou

I be indeed 
what thing you please a worm that you may tread on 
low I can fall to show my duty 
till your disdain have dig a grave to cover 
this body with forget dust and when 
I know your sentence cruel of woman 
I will by a willing death remove the object 
that be a eyesore to you 

wretch thou dare not 
that be the last and great service to i 
thy dote love can boast of what dull fool 
but thou can nourish any flatter hope 
one of my height in youth in birth and fortune 
can ever descend to look upon thy lowness 
much less consent to make my lord of one 
I will not accept though offer for my slave 
my thought stoop not so low 

there be her true nature 
no personate scorn 

I wrong my worth 
or to exchange a syllable or look 
with one so far beneath i 

yet take heed 
take heed of pride and curious consider 
how brittle the foundation be on which 
you labour to advance it Niobe 
proud of her numerous issue dare contemn 
Latona double burden but what follow 
she be leave a childless mother and mourn to marble 
the beauty you overprize so time or sickness 
can change to loathe deformity your wealth 
the prey of thief queen Hecuba Troy fire 
Ulysses bondwoman but the love I bring you 
nor time nor sickness violent thief nor fate 
can ravish from you 

can the oracle 
give better counsel 

Say will you relent yet 
revoke your decree that I shall die 
or shall I do what you command resolve 
I be impatient of delay

I shall look on your tragedy unmoved 
peradventure laugh at it for it will prove 
a comedy to i 

o devil devil

of lover fall upon you and hereafter 
when any man like i contemn shall study 
in the anguish of his soul to give a name 
to a scornful cruel mistress let he only 
say this most bloody woman be to i 
as Anaxerete be to wretched Iphis 
now feast your tyrannous mind and glory in 
the ruin you have make for Hymen band 
that shall have make we one this fatal halter 
for ever shall divorce we at your gate 
as a trophy of your pride and my affliction 
I will present hang myself 

not for the world

to your place again 
and see what follow

with the conclusion beside upon the sudden 
I feel myself much indispose 

to bed then 
I will be thy doctor

in this then passion which I must find out 
or my intelligence freeze 

Come to i Paris 
tomorrow for your reward

and the next action like a gaditan strumpet 
I shall look to see you tumble 

prithee be patient 
I that have suffer great wrong bear this 
and that till my revenge my comfort be exeunt 

why it be impossible Paris 

you observe not 
as it appear the violence of her passion 
when personate Iphis he pretend 
for your contempt fair Anaxerete 
to hang himself 

yes yes I note that 
but never can imagine it can work she 
to such a strange intemperance of affection 
as to dote on he 

by my hope I think not 
that she respect though all here see and mark it 
presume she can mould the emperor will 
into what form she like though we and all 
the informer of the world conspire to cross it 

then with what eagerness this morning urge 
the want of health and rest she do entreat 
Caesar to leave she 

who no soon absent 
but she call dwarf so in her scorn she style i 
put on my pantofle fetch pen and paper 
I be to write and with distract look 
in her smock impatient of so short delay 
as but to have a mantle throw upon she 
she seal I know not what but it be endorse 
to my love Paris 

add to this I hear she 
Sav when a page receive it let he wait i 
and careful in the walk call our retreat 
where Caesar in his fear to give offence 
unsent for never enter 

This be certain 
for these be more than jealous supposition 
why do not you that be so near in blood 
discover it 

alas you know we dare not 
it will be receive for a malicious practice 
to free we from that slavery which her pride 
impose on we but if you will please 
to break the ice on pain to be sink ever 
we will aver it 

I will second you 
but that I be command with all speed 
to fetch in Ascletario the Chaldaean 
who in his absence be condemn of treason 
for calculate the nativity 
of Caesar with all confidence foretell 
in every circumstance when he shall die 
a violent death yet if you can approve 
of my direction I will have you speak 
as much to Aretinus as you have 
to i deliver he in his own nature 
be a spy on weak ground no doubt 
will undertake it not for goodness sake 
with which he never yet hold correspondence 
but to endear his vigilant observe 
of what concern the emperor and a little 
to triumph in the ruin of this Paris enter Aretinus 
that cross he in the senate house here he come 
his nose hold up he have something in the wind 
or I much err already my design 
command i hence great lady but I leave 
my wish with you Exit Parthenius 

have I catch your greatness 
in the trap my proud Augusta 

what be it sap he 

and my fine roman actor be it even so 
no courser dish to take your wanton palate 
save that which but the emperor none dare cast off 
it be very well I needs must glory in 
this rare discovery but the reward 
of my intelligence bid i think even now 
by a edict from Caesar I have power 
to tread upon the neck of slavish Rome 
dispose office and province 
to my kinsman friend and client 

this be more 
than usual with he 

Aretinus 

how 
no more respect and reverence tender to i 
but Aretinus it be confess that title 
when you be princess and command all 
have be a favour but be as you be 
vassal to a proud woman the worst bondage 
you stand oblige with as much adoration 
to entertain he that come arm with strength 
to break your fetter as tan galleyslave 
pay such as do redeem they from the oar 
I come not to entrap you but aloud 
pronounce that you be manumise and to make 
your liberty sweet you shall see she fall 
this empress this Domitia what you will 
that triumph in your misery 

Were you serious 
to prove your accusation I can lend 
some help 

and I 

and I 

no atom to i 
my eye and ear be everywhere I know all 
to the line and action in the play that take she 
her quick dissimulation to excuse 
her be transport with her morning passion 
I bribe the boy that do convey the letter 
and have peruse it make it up again 
your grief and anger be to i familiar 
that Paris be bring to she and how far 
he shall be tempt 

this be above wonder 

my gold can work much strange miracle 
than to corrupt poor waiter here join with i 
it be a complaint to Caesar this be that 
shall ruin she and raise you have you set your hand 
to the accusation 

and will justify 
what we have subscribe to 

and with vehemency 

I will deliver it 

leave the rest to i then 

let our lieutenant bring we victory 
while we enjoy the fruit of peace at home 
and be secure from our intestive foe 
far worse than foreign enemy doubt and fear 
though all the sky be hang with blaze meteor 
which fond astrologer give out to be 
assure presage of the change of empire 
and death of monarch we undaunted yet 
guard with our own thunder bid defiance 
to they and fate we be too strong arm 
for they to wound we 

as thou be 
more than a man 

let not thy passion be 
rebellious to thy reason 

but receive 
this trial of your constancy as unmoved 
as you go to or from the Capitol 
thank give to love for triumph 

ha 

vouchsafe 
a while to stay the lightning of your eye 
poor mortal dare not look on 

there be no vein 
of you that rise high with rage but be 
a earthquake to we 

and if not keep close 
with more than human patience in a moment 
will swallow we to the centre 

not that we 
repine to serve she be we her accuser 

but that she be fall so low 

which on sure proof 
we can make good 

and show she be unworthy 
of the least spark of that divine fire 
you have confer upon she 

I stand doubtful 
and unresolved what to determine of you 
in this malicious violence you have offer 
to the altar of her truth and pureness to i 
you have but fruitless labour to sully 
a white robe of perfection black mouth envy 
can belch no spot on but I will put off 
the deity you labour to take from i 
and argue out of probability with you 
as if I wear a man can I believe 
that she that borrow all her light from i 
and know to use it will betray her darkness 
to your intelligence and make that apparent 
which by her perturbation in a play 
be yesterday but doubt and find none 
but you that be her slave and therefore hate she 
who aid she may employ to make way for she 
or Aretinus who long since she know 
to be the cabinet counsellor nay the key 
of Caesar secret can her beauty raise she 
to this unequalled height to make she fall 
the more remarkable or must my desire 
to she and wrong to Lamia be revenge 
by she and on herself that draw on both 
or she leave our imperial bed to court 
a public actor 

who dare contradict 
these more than human reason that have power 
to clothe base guilt in the most glorious shape 
of innocence 

to well she know the strength 
and eloquence of her patron to defend she 
and thereupon presume fall secure 
not fear a accuser nor the truth 
produce against she which your love and savour 
will never discern from falsehood 

I will not here 
a syllable more that may invite a change 
in my opinion of she you have raise 
a fierce war within i by this fable 
though with your life you vow to make it story 
then if and at one instant all my legion 
revolt from i and come arm against i 
here in this paper be the sword predestine 
for my destruction here the fatal star 
that threaten more than ruin this the death head 
that do assure i if she can prove false 
that I be mortal which a sudden fever 
will prompt i to believe and faint yield to 
but now in my full confidence what she suffer 
in that from any witness but myself 
I nourish a suspicion she be untrue 
my toughness return to i lead on monster 
and by the forfeit of your life confirm 
she be all excellence as you all baseness 
or let mankind for her fall bold swear 
there be no chaste wife now nor ever be 

say we command that none presume to dare 
on forfeit of our favour that be life 
out of a saucy curiousness to stand 
within the distance of their eye or ear 
till we please to be wait on and sirrah exeunt servant 
however you be except let it not 
beget in you a arrogant opinion 
it be do to grace you 

with my humble service 
I but obey your summons and shall blush else 
to be so near you 

it will become you rather 
to fear the greatness of the grace vouchsafe you 
may overwhelm you and it will do no less 
if when you be reward in your cup 
you boast this privacy 

that be mighty empress 
to play with lightning 

you conceive it right 
the mean to kill or save be not alone 
in Caesar circumscribe for if incense 
we have our thunder to that strike as deadly 

it will ill become the lowness of my fortune 
to question what you can do but withal 
humility to attend what be your will 
and then to serve it 

and will not a secret 
suppose we shall commit it to your trust 
scald you to keep it 

though it rage within i 
till I turn cinder it shall never have vent 
to be a age a die and with torture 
only to be think worthy of your counsel 
or actuate what you command to i 
a wretched obscure thing not worth your knowledge 
be a perpetual happiness 

we can wish 
that we can credit thou and can find 
in reason but that thou who oft I have see 
to personate a gentleman noble wise 
faithful and gainsome and what virtue else 
the poet please to adorn you with 
but that as vessel still partake the odour 
of the sweet precious liquor they contain 
thou must be real in some degree 
the thing thou do present nay do not tremble 
we serious believe it and presume 
our Paris be the volume in which all 
those excellent gift the stage have see he grace with 
be curious bind up 

the argument 
be the same great Augusta that I act 
a fool a coward a traitor or cold cynic 
or any other weak and vicious person 
of force I must be such o gracious madam 
how glorious soever or deform 
I do appear in the scene my part be end 
and all my borrow ornament put off 
I be no more nor less than what I be 
before I enter 

come you will put on 
a wilful ignorant and not understand 
what it be we point at must we in plain language 
against the decent modesty of our sex 
say that we love thou love thou to enjoy thou 
or that in our desire thou be prefer 
and Caesar but thy second thou in justice 
if from the height of majesty we can 
look down upon thy lowness and embrace it 
be bind with fervour to look up to i 

o madam hear i with a patient ear 
and be but please to understand the reason 
that do deter i from a happiness 
king will be rival for can I that owe 
my life and all that be i to Caesar bounty 
beyond my hope or merit shower upon i 
make payment for they with ingratitude 
falsehood and treason though you have a shape 
may tempt Hippolytus and large power 
to help or hurt then wanton Phaedra have 
let loyalty and duty plead my pardon 
though I refuse to satisfy 

you be coy 
expect I shall court you let mean lady 
use prayer and entreaty to their creature 
to rise up instrument to serve their pleasure 
but for Augusta so to lose herself 
that hold command over Caesar and the world 
be poverty of spirit thou must thou shall 
the violence of my passion know no mean 
and in my punishment and my reward 
I will use no moderation take this only 
as a caution from i threadbare chastity 
be poor in the advancement of her servant 
but wantonness magnificent and it be frequent 
to have the salary of vice weigh down 
the pay of virtue so without more trifle 
thy sudden answer 

in what a straight be I bring in 
alas I know that the denial be death 
nor can my grant discover threaten more 
yet to die innocent and have the glory 
for all posterity to report that I 
refuse a empress to preserve my faith 
to my great master in true judgement must 
show fair than to buy a guilty life 
with wealth and honour it be the base I build on 
I dare not must not will not 

How contemn 
since hope nor fear in the extreme prevail not 
I must use a mean think who it be sue to thou

grant to his sister as a testimony Caesar Aretinus julia Domitilla Caenis above

Something I know not yet

and opportunity these be but salad 
to sharpen appetite let we to the feast court Paris wanton 
where I shall wish that thou be jupiter 
and I Alcmene and that I have power 
to lengthen out one short night into three 
and so beget a Hercules 

while Amphitrio 
stand by and draw the curtain 

oh fall on his face

to witness with a smile he do desire 
to be so shame for all the pleasure that 
you have sell your be for what shall I name thou 
ungrateful treacherous insatiate all 
invective which in bitterness of spirit 
wrong man have breathe out against wicked woman 
can express thou have I raise thou from 
thy low condition to the height of greatness 
command and majesty in one base act 
to render i that be before I hug thou 
a adder in my bosom more than man 
a thing beneath a boast do I force these 
of my own blood as handmaid to kneel to 
thy pomp and pride have myself no thought 
but how with benefit to bind thou i 
and be I thus reward not a knee 
nor tear nor sign of sorrow for thy fault 
break stubborn silence what can thou allege 
to stay my vengeance 

This thy lust compel i 
to be a strumpet and i have return it 
in my intent and will though not in act 
to cuckold thou 

o impudence I take she hence 
and let she make her entrance into hell 
by leave life with all the torture that 
flesh can be sensible of yet stay what power 
her beauty still hold over my soul that wrong 
of this unpardonable nature can teach i 
to tight myself and hate she kill she hold 
oh that my dotage shall increase from that 
which shall breed detestation by Minerva 
if I look on her long I shall melt 
and sue to she my injury forget 
again to be receive into her favour 
can honour yield to it carry she to her chamber 
be that her prison till in cool blood 
I shall determine of she Exit with Domitia 

now step I in 
while he be in this calm mood for my reward 
sir if my service have deserve 

yes yes 
and I will reward thou thou have robe i of 
all rest and peace and be the principal mean 
to make i know that of which if again enter guard 
I can be ignorant of I will purchase it 
with the loss of empire strangle he take these hence to 
and lodge they in the dungeon can your reason 
dull wretch flatter you with hope to think 
that this discovery that have shower upon i 
perpetual vexation shall not fall 
heavy on you away with they stop their mouth 
I will hear no reply oh Paris Paris exeunt guard Aretinus julia Caenis Domitilla 
how shall I argue with thou how begin 
to make thou understand before I kill thou 
with what grief and unwillingness it be force from i 
yet in respect I have favour thou I will here 
what thou can speak to qualify or excuse 
thy readiness to serve this woman lust 
and wish thou can give i such satisfaction 
as I may bury the remembrance of it 
look up we stand attentive 

o dread Caesar 
to hope for life or plead in the defence 
of my ingratitude be again to wrong you 
I know I have deserve death and my suit be 
that you will hasten it yet that your highness 
when I be dead as sure I will not live 
may pardon i I will only urge my frailty 
her will and the temptation of that beauty 
which you can not resist how will poor I then 
fly that which follow i and Caesar sue for 
this be all and now your sentence 

which I know not 
how to pronounce oh that thy fault have be 
but such as I may pardon if thou have 
in wantonness like Nero sire proud Rome 
betray a army butcher the whole senate 
commit sacrilege or any crime 
the justice of our Roman law call death 
I have prevent any intercession 
and free sign thy pardon 

but for this 
alas you can nay you must not sir 
nor let it to posterity be record 
that Caesar unrevenged suffer a wrong 
which if a private man shall sit down with it 
coward will baffle he 

with such true feel 
thou argue against thyself that it 
work more upon i than if my Minerva 
the grand protectress of my life and empire 
on forfeit of her favour cry aloud 
Caesar show mercy and I know not how 
I be incline to it rise I will promise nothing 
yet clear thy cloudy fear and cherish hope 
what we must do we shall do we remember 
a tragedy we oft have see with pleasure 
call the false servant 

such a one we have sir 

in which a great lord take to his protection 
a man forlorn give he ample power 
to order and dispose of his estate 
in his absence he pretend then a journey 
but yet with this restraint that on no term 
this lord suspect his wife constancy 
she have play false to a former husband 
the servant though solicit shall consent 
though she command he to quench her flame 

that be indeed the argument 

and what 
do thou play in it 

the false servant sir 

thou do indeed do the player wait without 

they do sir and prepare to act the story 
your majesty mention 

call they in who present 
the injure lord 

it be my part sir 

thou do not 
do it to the life we can perform it better 
off with my robe and wreath since Nero scorn not 
the public theater we in private may 
disport ourselves this cloak and hat without 
wear a beard or other property 
will fit the person 

only sir a foil 
the point and edge rebut when you act 
to do the murder if you please to use this 
and lay aside your own sword 

by no mean 
in jest nor earnest this part never from i 
we will have but one short scene that where the lady 
in a imperious way command the servant 
to be unthankful to his patron when 
my cue be to enter prompt i nay begin 
and do it spritely though but a new actor 
when I come to execution you shall find 
no cause to laugh at i 

in the name of wonder 
what be Caesar purpose 

there be no contend 

why when 

I be arm 
And stand grim death now within my view and his 
unevitable dart aim at my breast 
his cold embrace shall not bring a ague 
to any of my faculty till his pleasure 
be serve and satisfy which do Nestor year 
to i will be unwelcome 

must we entreat 
that be bear to command or court a servant 
that owe his food and clothing to our bounty 
for that which thou ambitious shall kneel for 
urge not in thy excuse the favour of 
thy absent lord or that thou stand engage 
for thy life to his charity nor thy fear 
of what may follow it be in my power 
to mould he any way 

as you may i 
in what his reputation be not wound 
nor I his creature in my thankfulness suffer 
I know you be young and fair be virtuous too 
and loyal to his bed that have advance you 
to the height of happiness 

can my lovesick heart 
be cure with counsel or dare reason ever 
offer to put in a explode plea 
in the court of Venus my desire admit not 
the least delay and therefore instant 
give i to understand what I shall trust to 
for if I be refuse and not enjoy 
those ravish pleasure from thou I run mad for 
I will swear unto my lord at his return 
make what I deliver good with tear 
that brutish thou will have force from i 
what I make suit for and then but imagine 
what it be to die with these word slave and traitor 
with burn corrosive write upon thy forehead 
and live prepare for it 

this he will believe 
upon her information it be apparent 
and then I be nothing and of two extreme 
wisdom say choose the less rather than fall 
under your indignation I will yield 
this kiss and this confirm it 

now sir now 

I must take they at it 

yes sir be but perfect 

o villain thankless villain I shall talk now 
but I have forget my part but I can do 
thus thus and thus kill Paris 

o I be slay in earnest 

it be time and it be my purpose my good Paris 
and yet before life leave thou let the honour 
I have do thou in thy death bring comfort to thou 
if it have be within the power of Caesar 
his dignity preserve he have pardon thou 
but cruelty of honour do deny it 
yet to confirm I love thou it be my study 
to make thy end more glorious to distinguish 
my Paris from all other and in that 
have show my pity nor will I let thou fall 
by a centurion sword or have thy limb 
Rent piece meal by the hangman hook however 
thy crime deserve it but as thou do live 
Rome brave actor it be my plot that thou 
shall die in action and to crown it die 
with a applause endure to all time 
by our imperial hand his soul be free 
from the prison of his flesh let it mount upward 
and for this trunk when that the funeral pile 
have make it ash we will see it enclose 
in a golden urn poet adorn his hearse 
with their most ravish sorrow and the stage 
for ever mourn he and all such as be 
his glad spectator weep his sudden death 
the cause forget in his epitaph exeunt a sad music the player bear off Paris body Caesar and the rest follow 

keep a strong guard upon he and admit not 
access to any to exchange a word 
or syllable with he till the emperor please 
to call he to his presence the relation 
that you have make i Stephanos of these late 
strange passion in Caesar much amaze i 
the informer Aretinus put to death 
for yield he a true discovery 
of the empress wantonness poor Paris kill first 
and now lament and the princess 
consign to several island yet Augusta 
the machine on which all this mischief move 
receive again to grace 

nay court to it 
such be the impotence of his affection 
yet to conceal his weakness he give out 
the people make suit for she who they hate more 
than civil war or famine but take heed 
my lord that nor in your consent nor wish 
you lend or furtherance or favour to 
the plot contrive against she shall she prove it 
nay doubt it only you be aloft man 
her power over dote Caesar be now 
great than ever 

it be a truth I shake at 
and when there be opportunity 

say but do 
I be you and sure 

I will stand one trial more 
and than you shall hear from i 

now observe 
the fondness of this tyrant and her pride 

nay all be forget 

it may be on your part 

forgive to Domitia it be a favour 
that you shall welcome with more cheerful look 
can Caesar pardon what you dare not hope for 
that do the injury and yet must sue 
to she who guilt be wash off by his mercy 
only to entertain it 

I ask none 
and I shall be more wretched to receive 
remission for what I hold no crime 
but by a bare acknowledgement then if 
by slight and contemn it as now 
I date thy utmost fury though thy flatterer 
persuade thou that thy murder lust and rape 
be virtue in thou and what please Caesar 
though never sow just be right and lawful 
or work in thou a false belief that thou 
be more than mortal yet I to thy tooth 
when circle with thy guard thy rod thy axe 
and all the ensign of thy boast power 
will say Domitian nay add to it Caesar 
be a weak feeble man a bondman to 
his violent passion and in that my slave 
nay more my slave than my affection make i 
to my love Paris 

can I live and hear this 
or hear and not revenge it come you know 
the strength that you hold on i do not use it 
with too much cruelty for though it be grant 
that lydian Omphale have less command 
over Hercules than you usurp over i 
reason may teach i to shake off the yoke 
of my fond dotage 

never do not hope it 
it can be thou bring my beauty captive 
and not to be redeem my empire be large 
than thy Domitian which I will exercise 
with rigor on thou for my Paris death 
and when I have force those eye now red with fury 
to drop down tear in vain spend to appease i 
I know thy server such to my embrace 
which shall be though still kneel for still deny thou 
that thou with languishment shall wish my actor 
do live again so thou may be his second 
to feed upon those delicate when he be sate 

o my Minerva 

there she be invoke she 
she can arm thou with ability 
to draw thy sword on i my power be great 
or only say to thy centurion 
dare none of you do what I shake to think on 
and in this woman death remove the fury 
that every hour afflict i Lamia wrong 
when thy lust force i from he be in i 
at the height revenge nor will I outlive Paris 
but that thy love increase with my hate 
may add unto thy torment so withal 
contempt I can I leave thou Exit Domitia 

I be lose 
nor be I Caesar when I first betray 
the freedom of my faculty and will 
to this imperious Siren I lay down 
the empire of the world and of myself 
at her proud foot sleep all my ireful power 
or be the magic of my dotage such 
that I must still make suit to hear those charm 
that do increase my thraldom wake my anger 
for shame break through this lethargy and appear 
with usual terror and enable i 
since I wear not a sword to pierce her heart 
nor have a tongue to say this let she die 
though it be do with a fevershaken hand pull out a table book 
to sign her death assist i great Minerva 
and vindicate thy votary so she be now 
among the list of those I have prescribe 
and be to free i of my doubt and fear 
to die tomorrow write 

that same fatal book 
be never draw yet but some man of rank 
be mark out for destruction 

I begin 
to doubt myself 

who wait there

and since I have subdue triumphant love 
I will not deify pale captive scare 
nor in a thought receive it for till thou 
wise Minerva that from my first youth 
have be my sole protectress do forsake i 
not junius Rusticus threaten apparition 
nor what this soothsayer but even now foretell 
be thing impossible to humane reason 
shall in a dream disturb i bring my couch there enter with couch 
a sudden but a secure drowsiness 
invite i to repose myself let music 
with some choice ditty second it i the mean time 
rest there dear book which open when I wake lay the book under his pillow the music and song Caesar sleep 

write my name 
in his bloody scroll Parthenius the fear be idle 
he dare not can not 

I can assure nothing 
but I observe when you depart from he 
after some little passion but much fury 
he draw it out who death he sign I know not 
but in his look appear a resolution 
of what before he stagger at what he have 
determine of be uncertain but too soon 
will fall on you or i or both or any 
his pleasure know to the tribune and centurion 
who never use to inquire his will but serve it 
now if out of the confidence of your power 
the bloody catalogue be still about he 
as he sleep you dare peruse it or remove it 
you may instruct yourself or what to suffer 
or how to cross it 

I will not be catch 
with too much confidence by your leave sir ha 
no motion you lie uneasy sir 
let i mend your pillow 

have you it 

it be here 

oh 

you have wake he soft gracious madam 
while we be unknown and then consult at leisure 
defend i goddess or this horrid dream 
will force i to distraction whether have 
these fury bear thou let i rise and follow 
I be bathe over with the cold sweat of death 
and be deprive of organ to pursue 
these sacrilegious spirit be I at once 
rob of my hope and be no I live rise distract 
yes live and have discourse to know myself 
of god and man forsake what accuser 
within i cry aloud I have deserve it 
it be just to neither who dare speak this 
be I not Caesar how I again repeat it 
presumptuous traitor thou shall die what traitor 
he that have be a traitor to himself 
and stand convict here yet who can sit 
a competent judge over Caesar Caesar yes 
Caesar by Caesar sentence and must suffer 
Minerva can save he ha where be she 
where be my goddess vanish I be lose then 
no it be no dream but a most real truth 
that junius Rusticus and Palphurius Sura 
although their ash be cast in the sea 
whereby their innocence make up again 
and in corporeal form but now appear 
wave their bloody sword above my head 
as at their death they threaten and methinks 
Minerva ravish hence whisper that she 
be for my blasphemy disarm by jove 
and can no more protect i yes it be so 
his thunder do confirm it against which thunder and lightning 
however it spare the laurel this proud wreath 
be no assurance ha come you resolve enter 3 tribune 
to be my executioner 

allegiance 
and faith forbid that we shall lift a arm 
against your sacred head 

we rather sue 
for mercy 

and acknowledge that in justice 
our life be forfeit for not perform 
what Caesar charge we 

nor do we transgress it 
in our want of will or care for be but man 
it can not be in we to make resistance 
the god fight against we 

speak in what 
do they express their anger we will hear it 
but dare not say undaunted 

in brief thus sir 
the sentence give by your imperial tongue 
for the astrologer Ascletario death 
with speed be put in execution 

well 

for his throat out his leg bind and his arm 
pinion behind his back the breathless trunk 
be with all scorn drag to the field of Mars 
and there a pile be raise of old dry wood 
smear over with oil and brimstone or what else 
can help to feed or to increase the fire 
the carcase be throw on it but no soon 
the stuff that be most apt begin to flame 
but sudden to the amazement of 
the fearless soldier a sudden flash 
of lightning break through the scatter cloud 
with such a horrid violence force its passage 
and as disdain all heat but itself 
in a moment quench the artificial fire 
and before we can kindle it again 
a clap of thunder follow with such noise 
as if then jove incense against mankind 
have in his secret purpose determine 
a universal ruin to the world 
this horror past not at Deucalion flood 
such a stormy shower of rain and yet that word be 
too narrow to express it be ever see 
imagine rather sir that with less fury 
the wave rush down the cataract of Nile 
or that the sea spout into the air 
by the angry ork endanger tall ship 
but sail near it so fall down again 
yet here the wonder end not but begin 
for as in vain we labour to consume 
the witch body all the dog of Rome 
howl and yell like to famish wolf 
break in upon we and though thousand be 
kill in the attempt some do ascend the pile 
and with their eager fang cease on the carcase 

but have they tear it 

tear it and devour it 

I then be a dead man since all prediction 
assure i I be lose oh my love soldier 
your emperor must leave you yet however 
I can grant myself a short reprieve 
I free pardon you the fatal hour 
steal fast upon i I must die this morning 
by five my soldier that be the late hour 
you ever must see i live 

jove avert it 
in our sword lie your fate and we will guard it 

o no it can be it be decree 
above and by no strength here to be alter 
let proud mortality but look on Caesar 
compass of late with army in his eye 
carry both life and death and in his arm 
fathom the earth that will be style a god 
and be for that presumption cast beneath 
the low condition of a common man 
sink with my own weight 

do not forsake 
yourself we will never leave you 

we will draw up 
more cohort of your guard if you doubt treason 

they can save i the offend god 
that now sit judge on i from their envy 
of my power and greatness here conspire against i 

endeavour to appease they 

it will be fruitless 
I be past hope of remission yet can I 
decline this dreadful hour of five these terror 
that drive i to despair will soon fly from i 
and can you but till then assure i 

yes sir 
or we will fall with you and make Rome the urn 
in which we will mix our ash 

it be say noble 
I be something comfort however to die 
be the full period of calamity exeunt 

you see we be all condemn there be no evasion 
we must do or suffer 

but it must be sudden 
the least delay be mortal 

will I be 
a man to give it action 

can I make my approach though my stature 
do promise little I have a spirit as dare 
as she that can reach high 

I will take 
that burden from you madam all the art be 
to draw he from the tribune that attend he 
for can you bring he but within my sword reach 
the world shall owe her freedom from a tyrant 
to Stephanos 

you shall not share alone 
the glory of a deed that will endure 
to all posterity 

I will put in 
for a part myself 

be resolute and stand close 
I have conceive a way and with the hazard 
of my life I will practise it to fetch he hither 
but then no trifle 

we will dispatch he fear not 
a dead dog never bite 

thus then at all Parthenius go off the rest stand aside 

how slow pace be these minute in extreme 
how miserable be the least delay 
can I jump feather to the wing of time 
or with as little ease command the sun 
to scourge his courser up heaven eastern hill 
make the hour I tremble at past recall 
as I can move this dial tongue to six 
my vein and artery empty with fear 
will fill and swell again how do I look 
do you yet see death about i 

think not of he 
there be no danger all these prodigy 
that do affright you rise from natural cause 
and though you do ascribe they to yourself 
have you never be have happen 

it be well say 
exceed well brave soldier can it be 
that I that feel myself in health and strength 
shall still believe I be so near my end 
and have my guard about i perish all 
prediction I grow constant they be false 
and build upon uncertainty 

this be right 
now Caesar hard like Caesar 

we will to 
the camp and have there confirm the soldier 
with a large donative and increase of pay 
some shall I say no more enter Parthenius 

all happiness 
security long life attend upon 
the monarch of the world 

thy look be cheerful 

and my relation full of joy and wonder 
why be the care of your imperial body 
my lord neglect the fear hour be pass 
in which your your life be threaten

your clock master shall die that have defer 
your peace so long there be a post new light 
that bring assure intelligence that your legion 
in Syria have win a glorious day 
and much enlarge your empire I have keep he 
conceal that you may first partake the pleasure 
in private and the senate from yourself 
be teach to understand how much they owe 
to you and to your fortune 

hence pale fear then 
lead i Parthenius

after loss guard be useful know your distance exeunt Caesar and Parthenius 

how strange hope delude man as I live

however we be 
to pay our duty and observe the sequel exeunt Trib 

I hear he come be constant 

where Parthenius be this glad messenger 

make the door fast here a messenger of horror 

how betray

nay then I be lose yet though I be unarm 
I will not fall poor overthrow Stephanos 

help i 

thus and thus 

be you so long a fall 

it be do it be do base fall and die 

This for my father death 

This for my Paris 

This for thy incest these several stab he 

This for thy abuse of Domitilla 

force the door o Mars 
what have you do 

what Rome shall give we thank for

yet he be our prince 
however wicked and in you this murder 
which whosoever succeed he will revenge 
nor will we that serve under his command 
consent that such a monster as thyself 
for in thy wickedness Augusta title 
have quite forsake thou thou that be the ground 
of all these mischief shall go hence unpunished 
lay hand on she and drag she to sentence 
we will refer the hear to the senate 
who may at their best leisure censure you 
take up his body he in death have pay 
for all his cruelty here be the difference 
good king be mourn for after life but ill 
and such as govern only by their will 
and not their reason unlamented fall 
no goodman tear shed at their funeral exeunt omnes
