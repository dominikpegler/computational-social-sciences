my lord you be sad 

I be think Alberto 
of many thing have I not cause 

you may 
think on they with less trouble 

but of all 
what do imagine most afflict i I will 
prevent thy answer I be not trouble 
with the present threaten of the enemy 
with all his preparation to invade we 

you have more confidence in Vittori send 
to meet the insult king he have be fortunate 
in many war 

the war consume Vittori 
he have be too fortunate 

your wish ere 
against the common peace if he prove not 
a happy admiral we be lose 

be thou 
and all thy name lose and may no age 
find it again how dare you interrupt we 
when we do want your council we will call for you 

I be go sir 

my julio welcome 
what speak Cassandra yet 

nothing to encourage you the same obstinate thing 
victory have her heart she much condemn 
the roughness which you mix with your last courtship 
she say your father may command her life 
but you must be a stranger to her bosom 

I be too rude at my last visit 

rather sir too tame 

have I for this draw war upon my country 
neglect Sicily daughter leave a stain 
upon his court and pay his entertainment 
with wound one he love 

his favourite 
you have be less sir than yourself to have suffer 
his insolence nor be it a act become 
his master to send hither to negotiate 
a marriage for his daughter and when you 
so far engage yourself upon a visit 
to permit any of his gaudy upstart 
affront your person 

I acquit the king 
it be no state quarrel high with wine he do 
throw some disgrace on our italian lady 
while he will magnify some beauty there 
this he do second with a pride and rudeness 
my patience be not tame enough to suffer 
and careless of all danger I do punish he 

it be home and handsome 

I must owe to fortune 

for your return she do but do her duty 
to make it swift and happy 

I confess the princess use i noble though my fancy 
be not surprise for here I keep the image 
of fair Cassandra who divine beauty 
do scorn all competition 

do you love Cassandra before you go to Sicily 

yes but with too much silence and that love 
do make i apprehend more fierce the 
occasion to break off all foreign treaty 
Horatio fall and my quit the country 
upon it the king interpret a disgrace 
to his daughter and himself and in revenge 
have add this new tempest to the sea 
mean to our ruin julio 

all their fury 
may soon be interrupt if Vittory 
manage his business well 

that be all my trouble 

what 

Vittory there be the devil on it he may 
be fortunate and overcome 

can there 
be ill in that 

ill thou be shallow I 
make he not admiral but to engage 
his youth and spirit apt to fly on danger 
to perish in his hot pursuit of honour 
if he come home with victory my father 
and his wise state must give he thanks the people 
giddy run to meet the conqueror 
and owe their life and safety to his triumph 
but where be I what peace bring it to i 
what blessing be it to hear the general voice 
shoot their wild joy to heaven and I in torment 
certain to lose my hope in fair Cassandra 

there may be way at home to remove he 
and plant you in your wish 

it will be 
most happiness to hear his death 

that may 
ruin a kingdom 

ruin twenty more 
so I enjoy she first nothing can be 
too precious to forfeit I be mad 
and my desire by opposition grow 
more violent 

I think your masculine soul 
less capable of vexation shall a subject 
who with your breath you may blow out of the world 
raise such a storm within you 

no he shall 
I have find myself again come I will be merry 
but I will have Cassandra spite of fate 

resolve and have she 

stay it be convenient 
we do know how to do this julio 

you be in the right sir it be first indeed 
convenient to know how 

thou know his father 

signior Alphonso 

a bold and dare gentleman all flame 
when he be move and careless of a danger 
to vindicate his honour 

what of this 

he shall bear the foundation of a plot 
to make i lord of my desire 

he will rather 
meet torture then consent his arm be not 
yet wither and while he can lift a sword 
he will employ it to revenge Vittori

be know by my devotion have be still 
to appear in modest service 

to the point 

it be a point of deep neglect to keep 
your grace in expectation yet delay 
make joy the sweet arrow that fly compass 
arrive with as much happiness to the mark 
as those be shoot pointblank 

this courtier love 
to hear himself talk be not so impertinent 
we know your care 

and cost my lord sometime 
for they that hold intelligence abroad 
to benefit their country must not make 
idol of their estate and it be a happiness 
to sell their fortune for their prince smile

until our pleasure further know command 
the governor of the city place a guard 
about the gate let no man face appear 
without the wall the king our father mean 
to salute he first in person do you stand 

Give order that no man go forth to meet he 
I shall my lord

my lord 

nay nay I envy not his victory 

you envy he it be your cause he fight 
and for his country 

right and it be the cause 
that often prosper that without his valour 
will have defence itself 

if all virtue 
be leave to her own protection my lord 
unarm with strength and policy best state 
will find shrewd innovation 

you have best 
tell i I lie 

I dare not think so foul 

you be a traitor enter julio with a guard 
lay hand on he 

he that shall dare to say Alphonso be 
a traitor let his vein partake no blood 
of you and he shall curse he have a tongue 

disarm the rebel and to prison with he 

ingrateful prince 

I will tame your ruffian spirit 
So so I will now acquaint my father julio 
who must allow my act disease that 
be desperate require a rugged handle 
this be for thou Cassandra 

stand 
1 stand 2 stand 3 stand 

the king receive intelligence 

our ship 
must needs report that loud enough 

it be strange 
be it not possible we have mistake 
the shore transport with our naval victory 
speak gentleman or do we dream 

those wall 
be certain the same and that the city 
people when we launch forth and full of prayer 
for our success 

it may be they reserve 
their welcome till we march into the city 

they may have some conceit 

a general silence 
like night dwell round about we and no sign 
that man inhabit have we win at sea 
to lose ourselves upon the land or in 
our absence have some monster land here 
and make it desolate devour the native 
and make they creep into the earth again 

they may salute we with one piece of ordnance 

they can take we for their enemy 
captain inquire the cause let none else move 
yet stay unless it be some strange mortality 
and yet that can be have we bring home 
their safety purchase through so many horror 
and be this all the payment for our conquest 
to shut the gate upon we 

force they open 
with the canon shake their wall about their ear 
they be asleep 

for such another rashness 
thy head shall be the bullet of that canon 
and shoot into the town go to be temperate 
as I grudge none the merit of their valour 
I must hear none so bold 

I have do sir 

subject be bind to fight for prince they 
not bind to the reward of every service 
I look upon thou now fight at sea 
and have forget this error give no breath 
to such a thought hereafter honour pay 
double where king neglect and he be valiant 
true that dare forget to be reward 

this be but cold comfort for a knapsack man 

and yet it be strange the king shall thus neglect we 
this be cheap entertainment for a conqueror 
be it not Mauritio misery of soldier 
when they have sweat blood for their country honour 
they stand at other mercy 

they have sleep since 
and dream not of our suffering 

be the prince 
alive to who we owe our country quarrel 
the difference of both kingdom 
our war and fortune justify his act 
can he be guilty of this shame no more 
there be something will fain mutiny within i 
strangle the snake betimes Vittori so 
this be a way to forfeit all our fame 
fold up your ensign throw off all the pride 
that may express a triumph well march on 
as we have over buy our victory 

the gate be open now and we discover 
a woman by her veil in mourn habit 
come this way 

alone more strange and fatal 
it may be it be my genius come to give 
a melancholy warning of my death 
as Brutus have from he I will stand my destiny 
yet bear the resemblance of a woman 
it will less terrify who shall this be enter Cassandra veil in mourning 
lady your garment speak you a sad woman 
grief shall salute no near if it be 
in poor Vittory power to dispossess you 
of any sorrow 

o my dear Vittori 
my wish aim at none beside 

Cassandra 
we be reward have Vittori take 
into his body a thousand wound this kiss 
have make i well again or but one drop 
of this rich balsam for I know thy tear 
be joy to see Vittori safe the king 
with all the glory of his province can 
do half this honour to his admiral 
I have a place above all happiness 
and meet a great empire in thy love 
then fame or victory have ever boast 
my own my best Cassandra 

call again 
that temper which have make Vittori honour 
and if my tear which carry something more 
than joy to welcome home my best love lord 
affect you with no sadness which I wish not 
yet look upon this mourning not put on 
to counterfeit a grief and that will tell you 
there be necessity for you to know 
somewhat to check the current of your triumph 

what prodigy be these 

I be too careless 
of this sad habit joy to see thy face 
make i distinguish nothing else proceed 
and punish my too prodigal embrace 
it be not fit I be in one think bless 
and thou in such a livery 

when you say 
you have strength enough to entertain the knowledge 
of such a injury 

if it only point 
at i speak it at once I be collect 
shall see I will be conqueror at home 
if it concern thyself let it not flow 
too fast but rather let my ear receive it 
by such degree as may not kill too soon 
but leave i some life only to revenge it 

the prince who cause engage your war abroad 
have ill reward you at home 

he can 

sir in your absence I have suffer for you 
hourly solicit to my dishonour 

ha 

for though he call it love I may suspect it 
his personal visit messenger rich present 
leave i not quiet to enjoy myself 
I tell he I have give my faith already 
contract you impatient of my answer 
he urge his greatness swear he will enjoy i 
or be no prince in Naples I be yet 
preserve and welcome home my dear safety 

the prince do this 

this be but half the story 
by his command none dare salute your victory 
or pour their glad heart forth at your return 
to these he have new add the dishonour of 
your father who he have command close 
prisoner in the castle upon some pretence 
of treason in my eye you may behold 
how people shed their sorrow as the guard 
lead he to prison none so bold to ask 
the cause that make he suffer in his misery 

will the king suffer this 

Alas his age 
have make he tame a too indulgent father 
to such a son who will be all the law 
control what he please in this fall 
of justice which way will Vittori take 

Mauricio do hear this we must ask 
forgiveness that we have be valiant 
repent our duty and that victory 
we buy so dear we shall have die at sea 
and then perhaps be talk on in the crowd 
of honest man for give up our life 
which for our service they may now take from we 
we be not yet in the snare and we have power 
to stifle their design and prevent our 
dishonourable fall 

the soldier heart 
be you 

no Mauricio let they be the king 
if such as they forget their office we 
must keep our thought unstained I will to the king 
but without any train 

in this you do not 
consult your safety 

safety be a lecture 
to be read to child I do always carry 
my own security within Mauricio 
yet do not think I be desperate I will take 
no knowledge of the prince action 
but give account of my engagement that be 
not much amiss the king I know be gracious 
and the prince too however passion play 
this rebel in our soul 

you shall need sir

and the prince 
let we all look smooth the king be come himself 
to gratulate our success enter king of Naples prince julio Fabio Alberto

of my commission she be a lady sir

I will find you understanding 

let i prostrate 
my duty to your highness and be honour 
to kiss your hand 

Vittori I will not flatter 
I have no grace for he who father dare 
attempt a insolence upon my person 
which the son may be guilty of in his blood 

my father insolent and I guilty sir 
because I share his blood o that I know 
in what part of my vein to find those drop 
that I may sacrifice to your anger 
and expiate my father sin 

I come not to expostulate 

be this all my reward 

your valour have 
be pay in the success what you have do 
be duty if you have not mix our cause 
with private and particular revenge 

you speak not this to i sir 

yes to you 
we do not fear the bugbear in your forehead 
you will hear more 

sir you have mercy in you 

you have displease our son Vittori 

I witness the angel 

I must tell you too 
your father have transgress beyond example 

good heaven forgive he be this all 
all my reward 

what will you ask 

ask why I ask my father 

your father 

goodness leave i not the wonder 
of all mankind gentleman all go 

Alas Vittori 

I that command thousand 
this morning be not owner of one servant 
do thou stay with i 

my prophetic soul 
know this before 

the king return Cassandra 

we have think upon it Vittori and without 
the council of our son will condescend 
to your father liberty he be you upon 
condition you and he and this your mistress 
go into present banishment 

How banishment 

I run my son distaste 
there be no time for study he affect 
that lady if you stay something may follow 
to the general repentance troth I pity thou 
here take our signet time and absence may 
correct all 

o embrace it dear Vittori 
we shall meet safe everywhere but here 
enlarge your father and we can miss 
a happy fate 

can my Cassandra think so 
that word shall make i live a little long 
but these be strange turn madam Naples have 
no dwelling for we when we be quit of these 
we will with our grief make tame some wilderness 

what be to be do 

do you be undo all 
betray the crown you wear I see it tremble 
upon your head give such a licence to 
a rebel trust he abroad to gather 
strength to the kingdom ruin 

what can such 
a naked man attempt to make we fear 

he carry with he a whole army sir 
the people love who want no giddiness 
have they but opportunity and such 
a master rebel as Vittori to 
make spoil of all who counsel he to this 

not I and please your grace I wish it hearty 
undo 

you wish it sir be wish now 
the remedy for such a mischief you 
when the state bleed will wish it well again 
you be fine court surgeon have you stay his father 
it may have check his treason or Cassandra 

that be his torment 

we have be secure 
exasperate now with his affront 
as never traitor want impudence 
to blanch over his rebellion he may inflame 
the neighbour prince to conspire some war 
for his revenge 

his grace say right there may 
be a consequence of much danger and Vittori 
have fame abroad 

I do it for the best 
by his absence think to remove his anger 
I can have be content to have honour he 
for to say truth his service do challenge 
more friendly payment 

to say truth he be 
a noble valiant gentleman and deserve 

what deserve he 

a halter and shall please 
your highness I do wonder at your patience 
he be not put to death 

I must acknowledge 
Vittori have deserve for many service 
the love and honour of his country fight 
their battle and bring conquest home make tame 
the sea that threaten we secure the land 
and Rome allow some consul for less victory 
triumph and statue 

most excellent prince 
how just he be 

but when opinion 
of their own merit swell they into pride 
which set a price of that which modesty 
shall count a act of their obedience 
they forfeit the reward of thanks and honour 
and betray poor and most vainglorious soul 
Scipio and Antony and other roman 
deserve well of the senate and be honour 
but when they run to faction and pursue 
ambitious end to undo their country peace 
they be no long patriot but declare 
Rome poison and like gangrene on the state 
to be cut off lest they corrupt the body 

be ever prince so wise 

but son son how 
can these stain reach Vittori he have give 
no argument to suspect his fall from loyalty 

I do not sir accuse he nor do I 
more than become the spirit of a prince 
show I be sensible of his father impudence 
if you remember when I urge what trespass 
his father have commit he urge aloud 
be this all his reward as if his service 
be obligation to make we suffer 
and justify their affront but I waste breath 
since you be so well please my duty sir 
shall speak i still your son but let i take 
boldness to prophesy their insolence 
strike at my person first but you will find 
their pride reach high I be but a branch 
superfluous and may be prune away 
you have you say no argument to suspect 
his fall from loyalty if what be do to i 
be dead within you yet remember now 
you have disengage by exile his relation 
and tie of subject he owe now no faith to you 
what that and his disgrace and opportunity 
abroad may frame he to I leave to imagine 

nay prithee come back thou have awake i 
I find my rashness I do never think 
there have be so much danger we will study 
timely prevention let they be call back 
fly after they and in our name command 

you shall need 

how shall need 

your pardon 
in hope your wisdom will allow it after 
I have make that my act julio be go 
with strict commission for that purpose 

julio

now all your jealousy be lay 

I shall 
compose myself at his return to wear 
what countenance you will direct 

Cassandra 
you have send for too 

by any mean she be 
so precious to Vittori have she sin 
alone to merit banishment he will follow she 
through all the world 

woman be strange attractive 
fame speak her virtuous too 

some virtue she have enter Julio Alphonso guard 
Julio have prosper 
thou have do good service 
Alphonso though your late affront to we 
be foul in its own nature and may encourage 
other by your impunity yet we have 
with the remembrance of your former action 
lose your offence Vittori too shall find 
the honour he deserve 

how be this 

where be he 
he do not scorn our mercy julio 
where be Cassandra 

ship with Vittori thank Alphonso for it 
who you have pardon they be both at sea 

whirl wind pursue they 

where be your son Alphonso 

embark with his fair mistress I observe 
my lord which way your anger move in vain 
you vex your soul for they the sea be no part 
of your command the wind be master there 
which can raise a storm so black and ominous 
as their own country 

by what mean escape they 

take it from i and after cut my head off 
I charge he as his heart wish to enjoy 
a father blessing as he love the honour 
of his Cassandra fear some new plot 
to hire a bark and quick put to sea 
while I make some stay to dispose affair 
that may befriend we in another country 
he do obey and have my prayer the wind 
convey he swift from the shore and have 
your creature julio not make such haste 
I have dispatch and in another vessel 
follow his ship but heaven determine I 
shall be again your prisoner use your power 
but look to give account for every hair 
of this old head now wither in your service 

to the castle with he 

ay there be the king 
let i use one word more royal sir to you 

you will hear he 

fear not prince my soul be not fall 
so low to beg compassion 

speak Alphonso 

my duty still preserve I will advise 
your age to quit the trouble of your kingdom 
and ask the prince leave to turn a Capuchin 
why shall you stoop with burden of such a state 
and have a son so active turn friar my lord 
and make the youngman king 

I must endure 

away with he 

I will see he safe my lord 

what hasty news with you 

to arm great sir for your defence there be 
new danger from the sea 

another fleet 

And sail this way we suspect they be 
sicilian 

Vittori give a blow to their design 

do you but suspect it villain 

it may be 
some scatter ship 

have not Vittori mock we 
and play the villain with your trust 

they can not be reinforce so soon what number 

they cover sir the sea 

gather up force to 
prevent the land 

it be impossible 
they touch our shore by this time 

then make safe 
the city 

it may be another fleet mean to relieve 
the first and come not forth so soon 

now we want Vittori 

all the disease Naples ever groan with 
over take Vittori but Alphonso shall 
pay dearly for this mischief 

be not sir 
deject it be more easy to defend 
at home then thrive in foreign war these man 
will find as proud resistance 

can thou think 
I do look pale for this no julio 
although the sudden news may move i somewhat 
I have a heart above all fear and can 
know no distraction but Cassandra absence 
that make i look so wild and tear my brain 
with the imagination 

but the state 
we be in require you shall be active sir 

ah julio the army which I fear

give present order for entrenchment 
we will quarter here you shall make good that part 
with your horse troop and plant canon on that hill 
to play upon the town Naples shall find 
we do not venture all upon one stake 
that petty loss at sea which make they triumph 
and perhaps careless of more opposition 
shall dear be account for beside 
dishonour our daughter and our court 
by such a rude departure 

as they have 
scorn your alliance 

thy particular 
suffering Horatio and wound be put 
into the scale 

they be not worthy sir 
have his sword reach my heart my death have be 
no sin compare to that affront he throw 
upon yourself and daughter I be bind 
to engage that blood be give i to serve you 
and I do love those drop that in a cause 
so just make haste to show their duty to you 
better than those that dwell within my heart 

we be confident of thy loyalty 

the princess 

Alas Rosinda thou be not breed to these 
tumult and noise of war have not the sea 
impair thy health I be too rash to allow 
thy travail and expose thy tenderness 
to this rude voyage

proof of his courage and propound not only 
life and his liberty but so great a honour 
as next our title there be leave no glory 
to equal it

what shall this be read noble Vittori we know you be a soldier and present you not with naked pity of your fortune what some prince will take away we have purpose to cherish your life enjoy yourself and with it the command of all our force Naples ingratitude if you have put no false shape upon your injury may be argument enough to your revenge and justice be our soldier fight against your country so with one valour you punish they and make we satisfaction we will have pledge for this trust in Cassandra who head shall be the price of your disobedience 
sure I have lose my understanding ha 
do it not bid i to fight against my country 
I prithee read Cassandra and repent 
thou have think he merciful 

we have pledge for this trust in Cassandra who head shall be the price of your disobedience 
the language be too clear 

it carry more 
darkness than ever the night be guilty of 
and I look black already to have read it 
do he call treason justice such a treason 
as heathen blush at nature and religion 
tremble to hear to fight against my country 
it be a less sin to kill my father there 
or stab my own heart these be private mischief 
and may in time be weep for but the least 
wound I can fasten on my country make 
a nation bleed and myself too blast all 
the memory of former action 
and kill the name we live by o Cassandra 
thou do not well to praise the king for this 

his word do sound more comfort 

prithee tell i 
how can thou hope I shall preserve my faith 
unstained to thou and break to all the world 

Naples have be injurious and we make 
no solemn vow to love what have betray we 

take heed and do not grieve the saint to hear thou 
if Naples have forget Vittory service 
I must not make a desperate shipwreck of 
my piety what great vow it be 
article in the creation of my soul 
I shall obey and serve my country with it 
above myself death be a brave excuse for it 
no he shall see I be a soldier 
and dare be just say he shall torture i 
shall wickedness be strong in punishment 
and we not be as valiant in our suffering 

can then Vittori be content to leave his 
Cassandra to the misery of life 
alone for in the number of mankind 
I never shall find another in who love 
I can place any comfort 

do not say so 
prince will court thou then and at thy foot 
humble their crown and purchase smile with province 
when I be dead the world shall dote on thou 
and pay thy beauty tribute I be thy 
affliction and when thou be discharge 
from love i thy eye shall be at peace 
a sun more glorious shall draw up thy tear 
which grace heaven in some new form shall make 
the constellation blush and envy they 
or if thy love of i be so great that when I be sacrifice 
thou wot think of i let this comfort thou 
I die my country martyr and ascend 
rich in my scarlet robe of blood my name 
shall stain no chronicle and my tomb be bless 
with such a garland time shall never wither 
thou with a troop of wife as chaste as thou 
shall visit my cold sepulchre and glory 
to say this do enclose Vittory dust 
that die true to his honour and his country 
methinks I be take of my leave already 
and kiss the wet sorrow from thy cheek 
bid thou rejoice Vittori be a conqueror 
and death his way to triumph 

this be all 
a new disguise for grief to make it show well 

to make it show indeed I have talk idle 
and miserable forget myself I be check 
this tell i another tale if I refuse 
to obey the king direction he be not 
so kind to take the forfeit of my life 
but he will make the price of my neglect 
Cassandra innocent blood if I obey not 
to do a act injurious to virtue 
thy soul must be divorce 

sir I have read it 
and be not worthy of Vittory love 
to value this poor life above his honour 
keep your high thought preserve all peace within you 
you shall not buy my breath with your own shame 
I will die with that devotion I have pray for you 
which trust i be most hearty and I will shed 
no tear for my own funeral if any 
unruly drop break forth when we be part 
it be more to leave Vittori then the world 
yet if thou wot give i leave I will confess to thou 
before my head fall from this other piece 
I will deceive the hangman for ere thou 
go from i with a sigh into thy bosom 
I will convey my spirit and leave he 
but a pale ghost to mock his execution 

I can hold this conflict be more fierce 
than many thousand battle can thou die 

if you will have it so you have teach i 
to be in love with noble thought I shall 
have some weep over my hearse and when I be go 
seal by my blood a martyr for thy love 
the world shall praise i for it and the virgin 
and wife if I obtain no other monument 
build i a tomb within their heart and pay 
their yearly song and garland to my memory 
that die to save Vittory life and honour 

how shall Cassandra die to save Vittori 

Allow it 
so you be happy and although my wish 
be rather for the punishment of Naples 
more cruel than our enemy yet if you 
think it dishonour to oppose that country 
I have a heart most willing to preserve 
by any death your fame lose not a scruple 
of yourself for i I carry thy love with i 
and prophesy my story shall throw more 
disgrace on Naples than all thy revolt 
can bring upon thy name 

I be in a tempest 
and know not how to steer destruction dwell 
on both side 

Come resolve 

I must to let 
thou live I will take arm forgive i then

I stand not upon they my life be more precious to i then all these

how do you mean captain 

for your soul let it shift I think thou have little care on it thyself there be many will give all their estate to outlive these combustion 

I will I be sure on it condition I lose half my land 

a match my life against half your land to secure you and make a indifferent bargain present

if I die you have half your land by it if you live it be worthy divide transitory fortune I shall have the worst match on it 

but how will you assure i captain

and prince 

let we withdraw then and conclude it be a safe bargain for you sir if you fail what will all your estate do you good and then I forfeit my life if you escape I have but half your land 

I understand and thank you noble captain 

Alphonso must be send for out of prison 
he be a experience soldier 

to betray we 

now we be punish for Vittory banishment 

your fear will make we coward 

shall we make a sally forth 

Alberto 

we will expect more 
advantage first they have finish their redoubt 
be our river guard with a sconce 

on that part 
no enemy can endanger we 

what if you 
taste Alphonso he have be ever faithful 
and we too rash 

keep prudent watch julio 
something in the evening may be attempt 
death be the worst and better fall with honour 
then owe our life to fear I will Cassandra 
be in their camp o julio 

it be better 
she be at home in your possession 
a herald sir 

admit he 

Alberto julio 

what be the compliment now 

thus Naples be salute from my master 
provoke by injury above the patience 
of king to suffer without thirst of blood 
or pride of conquest he be come in arm 
to ask a satisfaction if you will 
not know the fury of a war which act 
such horrid ruin against man and nature that 
repentance can easy absolve 
the guilt in they that cause it meet condition 
and deserve timely my great master friendship 
with mercy on yourselves 

mercy 

be temperate 

Remember wound be make more easy 
then cure and now arrive within your country 
revenge may spread a wild destruction 
let mother still enjoy their sleep and dwell 
within their husband bosom let their child 
live to requite the parent groan and prosper 
let old man pay their debt only to nature 
and virgin dedicate their yet chaste womb 
to Hymen holy use or at their quire 
with freedom of their soul sing holy prayer 
for the sweet peace you lend they to serve heaven 

this fellow be send to mock we in my heart 
I repent all the tie of arm and nation 
that give such saucy freedom to a herald 

I claim my privilege and dare say more 

what more 

Vittori be our general 

Vittori dare that traitor 

when king leave 
their justice and throw shame upon deserver 
patience so wound turn a fury 

how dare Sicily trust he 

yes he have good pledge 
too great a pawn 

This this vexation 
I do expect but we must not be fright 
tell your insult master he shall find 
man that both dare and can resist this fury 
condition we despise nor let he magnify 
his purchase in that rebel every soldier 
with we have equal courage to Vittori 
but a soul far more honest 

honest 

so sir 
this war shall justify upon his heart 

I dare not stay to hear more lest my passion 
betray i what a fire this language have 
shoot through my blood the poor old king say nothing 
but fill a place like a state cipher 

herald 
return this to that giant of your war 
Vittori in his absence we shall find 
a punishment for his treason and to cool 
his hot vein say the first attempt he make 
against we shall as valiant be answer 
with his father head 

ha 

by thy master soul 
it shall and this be all our answer see 
he safe without the wall 

thunder have strike i 
I feel new sting about my heart my father 
be ever man so miserable throw 
upon despair if I refuse their war 
I lose my wife Cassandra if I fight 
my father bleed some divine arm sustain 
my feeble soul instruct it how I shall 
distinguish sorrow and which blessing rather 
I shall now part with a dear wife or father 

but do the prince affect thou so Cassandra 

I have tell you madam every circumstance 
I shall but flatter my own misery 
to speak it less misfortune have not make i 
your prisoner now if he have be more temperate 

but do thy heart allow he no affection 
thou be much unkind 

he have my duty madam 
which still I owe he as my prince but I 
have but one faith and that be give Vittori 
I fear I have displease you 

no thou have not 
do think he love thou still 

I know not madam but I hope not 

will I can hope so too 
thou have deserve my confidence and although 
thou can not help i I must tell thou all 
I love that prince love when I first see he 
and when he court i I think it be necessary 
to show I have a soft heart but he flatter 
and take too soon occasion of his absence 
the wound he leave upon Horatio 
be not so deep as i which howsoever 
I have disguise yet from my father eye 
can find no cure without his surgery 
that leave they in my bosom to this end 
I urge my father to this war and beg 
with many prayer to witness his revenge 

that be a desperate remedy how if 
your father be overcome and you make prisoner 

we shall find death or ransom the first will 
conclude my suffering the other not much harm we 
perhaps advance my end but if the victory 
shall crown our army I shall interpose 
to make condition for the prince fate must 
decide one of these way 

madam I pity you 
sure if the prince know with what constancy 
your love breathe after he he will find a passion 
to meet your noble flame 

I know not whether 
to pray for victory or to be conquer 
for till the war conclude I must despair 
to see who my desire pursue 

it be possible 
that you may see he madam 

when 

this night 
and speak with he without expose your 
person to any danger 

prithee do not 
mock i sweet friend 

you be compassionate 
of i and it be but duty I shall answer it 
with my desire to serve you not to hold 
your thought in expectation be there any 
gentleman near who you dare trust 

with what 

with carriage of a paper I shall run 
some hazard but there be nothing can weigh down 
that goodness you have show i be a stranger 
I will frame a letter madam in my name 
and by some charm of love invite he to 
your tent if he retain part of that flame 
which do so command in he be assure 
the prince will come 

thou be create to make 
i bless but with what safety can he reach 
thus far and not be know 

he to who trust 
you give this secret shall remove that fear 

there be a captain 

best of all 

Fabrichio 

Send for he straight if you allow this device 
I will present dispatch the amorous summons 

I will call thou sister 

call i servant madam 
in that I be honour 

be you ready madam 

for what 

to laugh I be turn enchantress and now it be upon the minute Pazzorello by the boy direction come for his magical armour

but I may be at the end of your mirth 

Prosper in all your wish 

Flavia that be excellent herald never 
look so dreadful where be the princess 

she command not to expect she but she le not be long absent where be the gamester
