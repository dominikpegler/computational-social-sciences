which have make Boulogne through the world renown 
and all our race with fame and honour crown 

but father how can you endure a slave 
to triumph in your fortune and here stand 
in soul deject and banish from your land 

I will tell thou girl the french king and myself

and take careful vantage of the time 
while I with all my power in aid of William 
the norman duke now english conqueror 
be busy employ he seize my right 
plant another and supplant i 
this be the ground of my extremity 

if for king William sake now conqueror 
you lose your birthright and inheritance 
how come it that he see you in this state 
and lift not up your fortune ruinate 

a conquer kingdom be not easy keep 
he have so much ado to guard his own 
that i be bury in oblivion 
and I be force to lose the name of earl 
and live in London like a citizen 
my four son be bind apprentice to four trade 
Godfrey my elder boy I have make a mercer 
Guy my next son enrol in goldsmith trade 
my three son Charles bind to a haberdasher 
young Eustace be a grocer all high bear 
yet of the citytrade they have no scorn 
thus bare necessity have make i seek 
some refuge to sustain our poverty 
and have place my son in such a sort 
the little wealth I have leave I leave to thou 
myself will travail to the holy land 
and ere I lie within the earth vast womb 
pay my devout vow at my saviour tomb 

be that the cause you send for my four brother 

their wish sight will cheer my age heart 
and I will bless they all before I part 

I wonder brother why my father have send for we thus early that all business set apart we must meet together this morning 

I know not the reason I have much ado to get leave of my master to be spare from my attendance in the shop and serve of customer 

i'faith as soon as I hear but the messenger say my father must speak with i I leave my tankard to guard the conduit and away come I 

I beshrew he I shall have be at breakfast with two or three good boy this morning but that match be disappoint by this meeting 

see where my brother be already come 

Godfrey Guy Charles young Eustace all at once 
divide a father blessing in four part 
and share my prayer among you equal 
First Godfrey tell i how thou like thy trade 
And know in thy thought what thou have be 
how can thou brook to be as thou be now 

bind must obey since I have undertake 
to serve my master true for seven year 
my duty shall both answer that desire 
and my old master profit every way 
I praise that city which make prince tradesman 
where that man noble or ignoble bear 
that will not practise some mechanic skill 
which may support his state in penury 
shall die the death not suffer like a drone 
to suck the honey from the public hive 
I hold it no disparage to my birth 
though I be bear a earl to have the skill 
and the full knowledge of the mercer trade 
and be I now to be create a new 
it shall not grieve i to have spend my time 
the secret of so rich a trade to know 
by which advantage and much profit grow 

well have thou do to overcome thy fate 
make thy mind conform to thy state 
how like my Guy the goldsmith faculty 

as a good refuge in extremity 
say I be bear a prince and be cast down 
by some sinister chance or fortune frown 
say I be banish when I have a trade 
and in myself a mean to purchase wealth 
though my state waste and tower honour fall 
that still stay with i in the extreme of all 

what say my three son Charles 

if I shall say I will not brook those bond 
which God and fate and you have tie i in 
you will be preach disobedience 
or shall I say the citytrade be base 
for such a great man son to take on they 
your fatherly regard will straight advise i 
to chastise my rebellious thought and say 
son you by this may live another day 
therefore as my two brother I reply 
you ask i if I like it I say I 

what say my young boy 

father I say hawk be a pretty sport 
and hunt be a princely exercise 
to ride a great horse o it be admirable 

Eustace I know it be but to my question 
how can thou brook to be a prentice boy 

methinks I can endure it for seven year 
do not my master keep i in too much 
I can go to breakfast in a morning 
with my kind mate and fellowprentice 
but he cry Eustace one bid Eustace come 
and my name Eustace be in every room 
if I may once a week but see a tilt 
six day I will fall unto my business close 
and ere the week end win that idle day 
he will not let i see a muster 
nor in a Mayday morning fetch in may 
I be no soon get into the fencingschool 
to play a venew with some friend I bring 
but Eustace Eustace all the street must ring 
he will allow i not one hour for sport 
I must not strike a football in the street 
but he will frown not view the dancingschool 
but he will miss I straight not suffer i 
so much as take up cudgel in the street 
but he will chide I must not go to buffet 
no though I be provoke that be the hell 
be it not for this I can endure it well 

son you must all forget your birth and honour 
and look into the time necessity 
I know you be persuade think not son the name of apprentice can disparage you 
for howsoever of you esteem they be 
even king themselves have of these trade be free 
I make a vow to see the holy land 
and in the same my saviour sepulchre 
have so well dispose you I will now 
first bless you boy and then prefer my vow 

with much ado do I contain my spirit 
within these band that have enclose i round 
though now this case the noble sun do shroud 
time shall behold that sun break through this cloud 

my genius bid my soul have patience 
and say I shall not be a prentice long 
I scorn it not but yet my spirit aim 
to have this hand catch at the crown of fame 

a haberdasher be the trade juse 
but the soft wool feel in my hand like steel 
and I can wish each hat come through my hand 
be turn into a helmet and each helmet 
upon a soldier head for i to lead 
war be the walk which I desire to tread 

I be a grocer yet have rather see 
a fair guilt sword hang in a velvet sheath 
than the best Barbary sugar in the world 
be it a freight of price inestimable 
I have a kind of prompt in my brain 
that say though I be bind to a sweet trade 
I must forgo it I keep too much in 
I will fast from meat and drink a summer day 
to see sword clash or view a desperate fray 

bridle these humour son expel they clean 
and your high spirit within your breast contain 
while I my tedious pilgrimage prepare 
to spend my age in poverty and prayer

here only to myself not to protect i 
or to defend i from apparent wrong 
since it be so I will follow after you 
in some disguise I will pursue their step 
and unto God and fortune yield myself 
towards sea they be go and unto sea must I 
a virgin unexpected fate to try 

thus have you see these brother ship to sea 
bind on their voyage to the holy land 
all bend to try their fortune in one bark 
now to avoid all dilatory news 
which may withhold you from the story pith 
and substance of the matter we intend 
I must entreat your patience to forbear 
while we do feast your eye and starve your ear 
for in dumb show which be they write at large 
will ask a long and tedious circumstance 
their infant fortune I will soon express 
and from the truth in no one point digress 
you have see the father of these four fair son 
already go his weary pilgrimage 
Godfrey Guy Charles and Eustace press to sea 
to follow Robert duke of Normandy 
imagine now you see the air make thick 
with stormy tempest that disturb the sea 
and the four wind at war among themselves 
and the weak bark wherein the brother sail 
split on strange rock and they enforce to swim 
to save their desperate life where what befall they 
disperse to several corner of the world 
we will make bold to explain it in dumb show 
for from their fortune all our scene must grow 
those citizen you see be Bullonois 
keep under bondage of that tyrannous earl 
to who the french king give that ancient seat 
which to the wrong pilgrim do belong 
but in the height of his ambition 
Godfrey by shipwreck throw upon that coast 
stir up the oppress city to revolt 
and by his valour be the y surper slay 
the city from base bondage free again 
the man of Boulogne wonder what strong hand 
have be the mean of their deliverance 
beseech he to make know his birth and state 
which Godfrey do the people glad to see 
their natural prince procure their liberty 
homage to he create he earl of Bulloigne 
and repossess he in his father seat 
where we will leave he have honour win 
and now return unto the second son 
as the french king do with his daughter walk 
by the seaside from far they may espy 
one on a rafter float upon the wave 
who as he draw more near unto the shore 
they may discern a man though base clad 
yet spark of honour kindle in his eye 
he at first sight the beauteous lady love 
and pray her father to receive he home 
to which the king accord and in his court 
make he a great and special officer 
there leave we guy a gallant courtier prove 
and of the beauteous lady well belove 
Charles the three son be by the wind and wave 
bear on a plank as far as Italy 
and land just at a lofty mountain foot 
upon who top a many outlaw thief 
bandit bravo such as keep in cave 
make their abode this crew assail young Charles 
who in the bicker strike their captain dead 
they wonder at his valour and be now 
without a leader humble seek to he 
to be their chieftain and command their strength 
which at their earnest suit he undertake 
we leave he there think his brother drown 
nor know yet his father there lie bind 
Eustace the young of the four be cast 
upon the coast of Ireland and from thence 
he come to travail to Jerusalem 
suppose his three brethren drown by sea 
thus have you see these four that be but now 
all in one fleet a many thousand league 
sever from one another Guy in France 
Godfrey in Boulogne Charles in Italy 
Eustace in Ireland among the irish kern 
yet gentleman the self same wind and fortune 
that part they may bring they altogether 
their sister follow they with zealous foot 
be patient you will wonder when they meet 
four London prentice will ere they die 
advance their tower fame above the sky 
and win such glorious praise as never fade 
unto themselves and honour of their trade 
grant they your wont patience to proceed 
and their keen sword shall make the pagan bleed

cover a heart obdurate hard as flint 
since I first see thou float on the wave 
the fire of love fly from your radiant eye 
which like a sunbeam pierce unto my heart

Robert my arm shall act a wondrous thing 
I will hurl he like a stone out of a sling 
not have the way I will fling thou on the earth 
and then march over thou with all my troop 

Robert of Normandy by all the honour 
thou hope to achieve thou in these holy war 
stand from betwixt we let we but try one fall 
I will cast his corklike trunk by wondrous skill 
as Hercules throw Lycus from a hill 

for god sake and our saviour in who book 
you now be enter as his soldier press 
in who camp royal if you mutiny 
you be find guilty by his martial law 
and worthy death I charge you prince both 
to abandon this injurious enmity 
stand you betwixt the soldier lest this sting 
of blind sedition reign in this our army 
and feed upon our body like a plague 
prince I charge you by your saviour blood 
shed for your sin you shed none at this time 

well let he march before I will resign 
Robert prevail Frenchman the right be thou 

I will not march first but in courtesy 
I will resign that honour place to thou 
but what a king shall say I shall not do 
with violent rage that will I run into 
go on by heaven you shall I yield it you 
by heaven you shall the place I free grant 
friendship can more with i then rude constraint 

thy honour love with honour I return 
what thou will give i I resign thou back 
this kind reply to i stand like a charm 
then royal let we march on arm in arm 

such just proportion prince still shall keep 
brave lord of Boulogne join your troop with we 
that be by birth approve Englishman 
and lord of France that under your conduct 
have ready arm ten thousand fight man 
to fight with we for fair Jersualem 
distress by misbelieve infidel 
let we unite a friendly christian league 
we have enter valiant lord upon our way 
even to the midst of fertile Lombary 
by writer term the garden of the world 
half of our way we have overcome already 
then let we here in camp upon these down 
but stay what threaten voice of warfare sound 

have not young Eustace in the sea be drown 
I shall have say he tread upon this ground 
and but none escape the dangerous sea save I 
this Frenchman I shall think my brother Guy 

prince my master county palatine 
wonder what bold foot dare presume to tread 
upon his confine without ask leave 
send i to know the cause of your arrive 
or why the arm hoof of your fiery steed 
dare wound the forehead of his peaceful land 

Dare send thy lord in that ambitious key 

or have the pride of thy refine tongue 
guild thy message with these word of scorn 

add thou unto thy message knight or no 

the naked tenor of my master mind 
thus I enfold rash saucy insolent 
that by audacious boldness have not fear 
to break into my sovereign royal pale 
I charge you to return the way you come 
and step by step tell every tedious stride 
that you have measure rash in his land 
or by the honour of his name he swear 
to chase you from the margin of his coast 
with an unnumbered army and huge host 

march back again o scandal to our name 
have we deserve to be so censure on 
though not one man upon my part will stand 
alone I will pierce the bowel of his land 

base retire and thirty thousand strong 
Were the whole world power ambush in our way 
yet will we on return dishonourable 
forward I will march though every step I tread 
plunge i in blood thus high above my head 

prince have patience let i answer he 
knight I condemn not thou for speak bold 
the proud defiance that thy master send 
but mild we return our pleasure thus 
we do confess it be some oversight 
to march so far without some notice give 
unto the lord and prince that owe the land 
and we can wish that we have crave his leave 
but since it be thus that we have march thus far 
and base to retire be infamous 
if not with leave we forward mean to go 
despite of king or emperor shall say no 

I will inform the prince my sovereign so 

that young knight face methinks I well shall know 

I see the sword be sharp against infidel 
must be employ to lavish christian blood 
upon his soul lie all the heinous guilt 
who be a christian prince forbid and bar 
our quiet passage to these pagan war 

this bicker will but keep our arm in ure 
the holy battle better to endure 

well God for we for our intent be good 
charge be their soul with all this christian blood 

what be thou brave the county palatine

speak will you all retire the way you come 

God keep duke Robert from so foul a shame 

base retire when we have march thus far 
first we will unpeople this thy land by war 

then will we drive you back by our main force 
and seize upon your troop of foot and horse 

so say you but shall you attempt to do it 
we straight shall overthrow you horse and foot 

So say so do brave lord be gallant play 
but you will at the first push shrink away 

no proud italian all our spirit be fire 
which burn not downward but be make to aspire 
prince we confess we do forget ourselves 
presume on that ancient privilege 
which every christian brother prince shall claim 
one in the interest of another name 
a error we confess though not a fault 
but base with dishonour back to fly 
and to be hold as coward we deny 

and nothing else can satisfy my ire 
but whence you come the same way to retire 

and that I will never do 

nor I 

nor I 

then shall you on these Lombard champain die 
to arm brave soldier 

strike up warlike dumb 
prepare you christian prince now we come 

stay brave prince Tancred stay great norman duke 
out of my zeal to God and Christendom 
to stanch the blood which shall be broach this day 
unto the grief of all that honour Christ 
and joy to such as love idolatry 
I make this challenge general through the host 
of he that interrupt we on our way 
if any proud italian dare take up 
the honour gage which I have here throw down 
and fight a single combat for our passage

with a rough brow see thou confront his pride 

then what ten thousand christian life shall right

and I the other

o but behold I have this to hew my way 

I will not lose my champion for the world 

nor I this prince for be these spirit spend 
all Christendom their fortune may lament 
part they on equal odds and equal term 
both a like valiant both have honour win 
more valorous live not underneath the sun 

we will reserve their haughty chivalry 
to exercise against God enemy 

they have win honour I have idle stand 
by my good star I will have a challenge too 
if any in their camp dare answer i 
give i thy pike a pike a prince may trail 
and at that weapon will I challenge all 
great prince these fiery prince that come hither 
to brave our force have a champion 
to challenge we be we as valiant 
and shall we fail to do the like to they 
give i but leave my lord to send one boast 
to affright they like a devil through their host 

it please we then when thou will begin 

what champion shall we have to answer he 

I shall esteem he my immortal foe 
that shall attempt to take away the honour 
of such a strong encounter from my hand 
champion appear betwixt our royal host 
let we see thy strength make good thy haughty boast 

I be here stand thou forth on the adverse part 
survey i well brave Hector I resemble 
who very brow do make the greek to tremble 

but I Achilles proud ambitious boy 
will drag thy corse about the wall of Troy 
give i thy pike I will toss it like a reed 
and with this bulrush make my enemy bleed 
rapier and pike be that thy honour play 
look down you god this combat to survey 

rapier and pike this combat shall decide 
god angel man shall see i tame thy pride 

thou do thyself wrong to overcharge thy arm 
with such a weapon as thou can not wield 
I will teach thou thou shall like my zany be 
and feign to do my cunning after i 

thou will instruct thy master at this play 
think thou this ryestraw can overrule my arm 
thus do I bear he when I use to march 
thus can I fling he up and catch he thus they toss their pike 
then thus to try the sinew of my arm 

but thou shall charge he thus advance he thus 
thus shall thou take he when thou see from far 
the violent horse run to break our rank 

all that be nothing I can toss he thus 

I thus it be easy sport than the balloon 

we trifle time this shall thy rage withstand 

with this our host shall pierce thy sovereign land 

that host shall lose ten thousand pagan live 
with the rich honour of their overthrow 
that shall but lose his champion in this combat 
if both shall perish our brave christian army 
shall be more weak by thousand then it be 

their matchless valour have prevail with we 
free enjoy the pleasure of our land 
our army here we do conjoin with you 
to lead they to the fair Jerusalem 

we pawn our faith to this perpetual league 
and now we show ourselves that christian host 
in which true peace shall flourish and abound 
unto this peace let drum and trumpet sound 
champion embrace and all your stern debate flourish 
pour in abundance on the pagan head 
prince and lord let our unite band 
win back judea from the pagan hand 

thus have I mask my bashful modesty 
under the habit of a trusty page 
and now my servant servant be I make 
love that transform the god to sundry shape 
have wrought in i this metamorphosis 
my love and lord that honour i a woman 
love i a youth employ i everywhere 
I serve he wait upon he and he swear 
he favour both my truth and diligence 
and now I have learn to be a perfect page 
he will have none to truss his point but i 
at board to wait upon his cup but i 
to bear his target in the field but i 
nay many a thing which make i blush to speak 
he will have none to lie with he but i 
I dream and dream and thing come in my mind 
only I hide my eye but my poor heart 
be bar and keep from love satiety 
like Tantalus such be my poor repast 
I see the apple that I can taste 
I will stay my time and hope yet ere I die 
my heart shall feast as rich as my eye 

counsel brave lord the christian army march 
even to our gate with pace undisturbed 
the hollow earth resound with weight of arm 
and shrink to bear so huge a multitude 
they make a valley as they march along 
and raise hill encompass either side 
counsel brave lord these terror to decide 

jove great vicegerent over all the world 
let we confront their pride and with our power 
disperse the strength of their assemble troop 

Zion be we by conquest all judaea 
be the rich honour of our conquer sword 
shall we not guard it then and make our breast 
the wall that shall defend jerusalem 

they shall march over we that march this way 
before the Christian shall attain these wall 
with dead man face we will pave the earth 

I can judge the Christian be so mad 
to come in way of battle but of peace 

they rather travel in devotion 
to pay their vow at their Messiah tomb 
and so as pilgrim not as soldier come 

your own power blind you and have screen your eye 
my hair do wear experience livery 
but you the badge of youth and idleness 
their army stand upon a mountain top 
like a huge forest their tall pike like pine 
in height do overpeer the low tree 
their horseman ride like centaur in the mead 
and scout abroad for pillage and for prey 
courage be their good captain 

courage no 
pale fear and black destruction lead the so 

I say again the christian prince lead 
a army for their power invincible 
victorious hope sit hover on their plume 
their guild armour shine against the sun 
dazzle our eye from top of yonder hill 
like the bright streak that flow from paradise 

o conquest worthy the brave persian sword 
let we descend from forth the town and meet they 

no 

yes 

shall jove himself in thunder answer I 
when we say no we will pull he from the sky 

shall sultan sophy priest or presbyter 
or god or devil or man gainsay our will 
he they or thou will the brave persian kill 

quench your hot spleen with drop of sweet advice 
temper your rage with counsel mighty king 

I say ●e will make peace with Christendom 

I say the Persian scorn to be colleague 
or to have part with they of Christendom 

yet hear my age 

yet harken to my youth 

my tongue give place unto the Sold● age 

but I applaud the persian youthful rage 

stay lord our grave experience do foresee 
the mischief that attend on this debate 
we tread the path of our destruction 
by our dissension grow the christian strong 
who our unite heart may easy quell 
brave persian sophy we commend your hate 
to they that have abhor our pagan god 
yet temper it with wisdom valiant prince 
it be our security I will increase 
when with my word I mention gentle peace 

experience do instruct the sultan tongue 
harken to he he speak judicial 

my tongue a while give licence to my ear 
the depth of your grave wisdom let we hear 

then thus let we send unto the christian host 
to know what cause have bring they thus far arm 
if peaceable they come to visit here 
the ancient relic of their saviour tomb 
peace shall conduct they in and guard they out 
but if they come to conquer Zion hill 
and make irruption through our triple wall 
death and despair shall ambush in their way 
and we will seize the ensign they display 

my youth yield willing to your grave year 
let it be so but who shall we elect 
to be create lord ambassador 

Moretes shall be one for I be sure 
he will employ his tongue peace to procure 

Turnus another he that all thing dare 
will with defiance stir they up to war 

Moretes and brave Turnus speed you straight 
unto the christian host say if they come 
like pilgrim to behold the sepulchre 
our gate stand open to receive they in 
and be you painful to persuade a peace 
but if they stand upon their hostile ground 
say that our breast be arm our sword be keen 
bold be our heart and fiery be our spleen 
and so be go 

I to persuade a peace 

I go the furious rage of war to increase 

we will mean time conduct our royal host 
one half be i the other you shall lead 
to intercept they ere they win the sight 
of these invincible and highbuilt wall 
brave persian we will both in ambush lie 
sure now the Christian be all come to die 

behold brave Christian Prince all the glory 
that Tancred can inherit in this world 

part of it be i 

and part belong to i 

a heavenly mixture now beshrew my heart 
but Godfrey with the rest can cry half part 

I be all she 

that lady seem to i 
the fair creature ever eye do see 

Tancred of all thy face best please i 

fair lady 

madam 

Mistress 

beauteous love 

bright goddess 

nymph 

love who you will say I 
so you affect not my belove guy 

lord she be i 

when do my interest cease 

when I be here you brother outlaw peace 

why shall not I enjoy she 

why not I 

she can have none but i 

that we deny 

prince what mean this frenzy in your heart 
or have some necromantic conjurer 
raise by his art some fury in my shape 
to work sedition in the christian camp 
you have confirm by general parliament 
a statute that must stand inviolate 
namely that mutiny in prince or peasant 
be death a kingdom can save his life 
then whence proceed these strange contention 

I seize her first 

I first her thought do prove 

I plead the composition for my love 

if wealth will win the thought of that chaste lady 
I le bid as fair as any for her love 

if valour may achieve she I amongst many 
will bid more warlike blow for she then any 

nay if you go to scramble this for i 

speed they that list so you repulse be 

yet hear i prince 

hence with frivolous word 

stand we to prate when other draw their sword 

speak thou my cause 

this shall my pleader be 

thou be for we 

and sword speak thou for i 

he that best love i pierce i with his sword 
lest I become your general overthrow 
I do conjure you by the love you bear i 
either to banish this hostility 
or all at once to act my tragedy 
a blow be death proclaim by parliament 
can you make law and be the first that break they 
know I that this my beauty breed this strife 
with some black poison I will stain my cheek 
till I look foul than a Aethiop 
still do you brandish your contentious sword 
this night shall end my beauty and tomorrow 
look to behold my crystal eye scratch out 
my visage martyr and my hair tear off 
he that best love it ransom it with peace 
I will preserve it if your fury cease 
but if you still persist the heaven I call 
as my vow witness I will hate you all 

to show my love my sword shall sleep in rest 

I will keep my sharp for the brave sultan crest 

peace sword 

the norman Robert keep his keen 
to abate the fury of the sultan spleen

thou make thy lord a king his love a queen 

you have redeem my beauty your last jar 
have make perfection with my face at war 

lady the virtuous motion of your heart 
add to the abundant grace of your fame 
it be your beauty that do blind our soul 
and in our close breast place oblivion 
it be true we have ordain a strict decree 
that whosoever in our Christian host 
strike with a sword in hostile enmity 
forfeit his life then break off this debate 
and keep our own decree inviolate 

health to the christian from the mighty sultan 

death and destruction from the persian sophy 

that tongue bring peace to thou will I attend 

that tongue bring war thy motion we commend 

speak peace thy look be smooth we will list to thou 

speak war bring war and we to war agree 

the babylonian sultan mighty prince 
send i to know the cause of this your march 
into a land so far remote from you 
if you intend to see your prophet tomb 
as holy pilgrim peace shall guard your way 

peace we defy let we hear what thou can say 

proceed proceed 

do and I will sound my drum 
to drown his voice that do for parlance come 

why I be bear to nothing in this world 
but what my sword can conquer shall we yield 
our fortune to base composition 
I have no hope my honour to increase 
curse be his base ear that attend to peace

that prince among you who heroic breast 
dare show itself to his triumphant spear 
except but the name of Christian 
like to the persian god he honour he 
but shall he know a heart in these proud troop 
and know that heart to be addict to peace 
he will hate he like a man that shall blaspheme 
in Zion tower hang his victorious flag 
blow defiance this way and it show 
like a red meteor in the trouble air 
or like a blaze comet that foretell 
the fall of prince

to practise hate against they meet with we 

Moretes no we scorn all abject fear 
and they shall know our heart as great as they 

it shall be so attend i pagan lord 
we come not with grey gown and pilgrim staff 
bead at our side and sandal on our foot 
fear in our heart entreaty in our tongue 
to beg a passage to our prophet grave 
but our soft beaver Fel● we have turn to iron 
our gown to armour and our shell to plume 
our walk staff we have change to scimitar 
and so with pilgrim heart not pilgrim habit 
we come to hew way through your main army 
and offer at the tomb our contrite heart

hold i so still where ere I next shall meet thou 
this sword like thunder on thy crest shall greet thou 
banish the camp I go but not so far 
but I will make one in this christian war 
like a unknown knight I will bear a shield 
in it engrave the trade I do profess 
when once I be a goldsmith in Cheapeside 
and if I prosper to these arm I will add 
some honour and the scutcheon I shall bear 
shall to the pagan bring pale death and fear 
adieu brave christian lord for I must stray 
a banish man can never miss his way 

why do you look so sad upon their grief 

ah pardon i my heart beget a thought 
at their departure which have be of force 
to have strain a tear or two from my moist eye 
how like be he to Eustace he to Guy 

a leaden weight of grief lie at my heart 
and I can wish myself be banish too 
to bear they in their sorrow company 

these for example sake must be remove 
and though their absence will much weaken we 
yet we have rather put we in God guard 
lessen our own strength than to bear with that 
which may in time lead to our overthrow 
march forward lord our love we will defer 
prince Tancred till our war chief heat be spend 
keep still this beauteous lady in your tent 

my lord be banish what shall poor I do 
there be no way but I must after too 
but ere I go some cunning I must use 
to make this lady my lord love refuse

to bring she out of love with my sweet lord

Shee love he best because she name he first 

the english Robert County palatine 
two gentleman that take i in the wood 
one be now banish but the other still 
stay in the army then the Boulogne duke 

and which of all these be the proper man 

i'faith let i hear thy judgement 

prince Robert be a gallant gentleman 
but the french lord uncomely and unshape 
Tancred a proper man but the french lord 
he have no make no good shape at all 
I can not love a man of his complexion 
I will not sue he if I be a lady 
have he more crown then Caesar conquer 

I see no such defect in that french lord 

ay ay it be so upon my life she love he 
I must devise some plot or they will use 
some mean to meet and marry out of hand 
lady he be my master but believe i 
he be the most in●e man for woman 
that ever breathe nay madam which be more 
he love variety and delight in change 
and I hear he say shall he be marry 
he will make his wife a cuckquean 

why though he do it be ver● in a woman 
if she can bear his imperfection 

upon my life they be make sure already 
she be please with any imperfection 
what shall I do

I must prevent it or else lose my love 

will thou consort i bear i company 
and share with i in joy and misery 

madam I will she love he and no wonder 
I will go be it but to keep they still asunder 

then from their tent this night we will steal away 
and through the wide wood and the forest stray 

then your report sound nought but death and war 

the Christian will not lend a ear to peace 

since they demean themselves so honourable 
this earth shall give they honourable grave 

by pride herself be their proud ensign bo●ne 
war in their tongue sit in their face scorn 

our resolution shall control base fear 
we be proud as they our sword shall answer they 

do thou deliver our strict embassy 

I do my lord 

do they not quake to hear it 

no more than rock shake with a puff of breath 
they come resolve and not in fear of death 

look they not pale 

with fury not with fear 
they be mad because your force be not there 

do you not dash their spirit fall not their 〈◊〉 
down to the earth when thou do speak of we 
go not a fearful murmur through their host 
when thou do number our unnumbered power 
do not their faint sword tremble in their hand 
at that name sultan 

or when thou name i 
my power my strength my matchless chivalry 
fall they not flat upon the earth with fear 

no but their proud heart bound in their breast 
their plume fly brave on their golden crest 
and they be ready to have fall at jar 
which of they first shall with the persian war 

there be no tongue but breathe defiance forth 
I can not see a face but menace death 
no hand but brandish a victorious sword 
they all cry battle battle peace defy 
and not a heart but promise victory 

there be not a heart shall escape our tyranny 
since they provoke our indignation 
like the vast ocean shall our courage rise 
to drown their pride and all their power surprise 

my scimitar be like the bolt of jove 
that never touch but it strike with death 
o how I long till we with spear in rest 
strike out the lightning from their highplumed crest 

I will burn off this beard in such a flame 
as I can kindle with my puissant blow 
yet the least hair I value at more worth 
than all the christian empire 

speak brave sultan 
shall our bare horse climb yond mountain top 
and bid they battle where they pitch their tent 

courage cry on but good advice say stay 
experience bid we fight another way 
why shall we tire our troop in search of they 
that with audacious boldness seek out we 
let we stand to receive they when they come 
and with a grove of pike grow on this earth 
where now no tree appear toss up their body 
who corpse by your strong arm keep aloof 
may hang like bloody pendant on your staff 

o sight best please to the persian god 

in the sky forehead shall the bright sun stand 
amaze to view that glorious spectacle 
and with the please sight forget his way 
to grace our trophy with perpetual day 

but how shall we receive their arm troop 
what special order will your grace assign 
to they that shall command your company 

it shall be thus this way the christian march 
the body of our host shall stay behind 
to be a strength to fair Jerusalem 
but we with certain soldier secret 
will lie in ambush the great persian sophy 
with Turnus and a chief command of man 
shall guard that way myself and thou Moretes 
will keep this passage with a troop select 
to seize on their forerunner scout and spy 
Assist we fate erelong the world shall know 
our glory by the christian overthrow 
this be my quarter these my man shall be 

Moretes thou and these shall follow i 

o whither will blind love conduct my step 
prince Tancred deer and english Robert joy 
be flee in secret and have leave our tent 
thus like a errant and adventurous knight 
I have leave the host to follow her fair search 
and dare not trust the air with my intent

if chance have cast his eye upon my love

whether her beauty have enrich his sight 
But it be my rival Robert Charles obscure thou 
for shall he see thou he will quick judge 
what adamant have draw i to these wood

for your accurse life this fatal snare

and train we hither with a chain of love 
to perish by the sword of infidel

what be that power if heavenly power he be 
that we may laud and praise his deity

to who our freedom and our life we owe 

by that inscription grave on his shield

cease admiration then let these event 
hasten our step back to survey our tent
