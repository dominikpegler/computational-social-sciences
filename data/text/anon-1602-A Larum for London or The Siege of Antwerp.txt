so leave i now and in my absence see 
that not a soldier perch upon the wall 
lest by the citizen they be espy 
and thereupon they grow suspicious 
be go and give the sentinel in charge 
they have a eye unto the southern port 
and hear you if that any force come 
let they be straight receive into the castle 
but with as little tumult as you may 

it shall be do my lord 

we must be secret as befit the care 
and expedition of so great a cause 
Antwerp be wealthy but withal secure 
our soldier want the crown they surfeit with 
and therefore she must spare from forth her store 
to help her neighbour nay she shall be force 
to strip she of her pouch and on the back 
of spanish soldier hang her costly robe 
the plot already be determine of 
and say Cornelius do but keep his word 
these swill epicure shall taste of death 
while we survive to rifle their rich coffer 
here come the man welcome Cornelius 
I see you make religion of your word 

speak soft good my lord lest you be hear 
the citizen be scout here about 

not one gernelius dare approach so near 
the castle shot keep they in great awe 
and for discovery by the eye fear not 
within this valley we may talk at large 
and no man see we say be you resolve 
to stand firm friend unto the Spaniard 
And sancto Damla vow you shall partake 
both spoil and honour with the best of we 

suppose my lord I give you my consent 
in all the world there be not at my command 
above six hundred Almain you yourself 
be in the castle scarce a thousand strong 
and what be these to sack so great a town 
so populous and large as Antwerp be 
the citizen be they but politic 
careful and studious to preserve their peace 
may a hour warn fill their street 
with forty thousand well appoint soldier 

ay but they be remiss and negligent 
their body use to soft effeminate silk 
and their nice mind set all on dalliance 
which make they fat for slaughter fit for spoil 
but say it be otherwise that in their peace 
and day of plenty while they flourish 
they have foresee the danger may ensue 
and exercise themselves in feat of arm 
yet we be sole commander of the castle 
and that command they what let be there 
be we much weak but we may prevail 
when once the a alarm sound like silly mouse 
they will hide they in the crevice of their wall 
and some for ignorance will stand amaze 
and some will be so tender of their flesh 
as they will scorn to bear the weight of steel 
no no brave Almaigne if man ever have 
a fit occasion to enrich themselves 
and fill the vast world with their echo fame 
now be that instant put into our hand 
and now may we be lord of this proud town 
my mind divine no less and till my foot 
tread a venturous measure in their street 
I shall be sick to think upon the deed 

I wish my lord as much as you detain 
but such a enterprise must be well ground 
lest in performance there be find defect 

what patient eye can look upon yond turret 
and see the beauty of that flower of Europe 
and in it be ravish with the sight of she 
o she be amorous as the wanton air 
and must be court from she nostril come 
a breath as sweet as the arabian spice 
her garment be embroider with pure gold 
and every part so rich and sumptuous 
as India not to be compare to she 
she must be court mary herself invite 
and beckon we unto her sportful bed 
what be he then more lumpish than rude iron 
by such a lodestar may not be attempt 
o brave Cornelius if within thy vein 
there be that heat of vallout I presume 
let we forslow no time till we obtain 
to revel in that bower of earthly bliss 

my lord what lie in i you shall dispose 
my regiment of Almain and myself 
will on the first assault revolt to you 
mean space I will give you close intelligence 
of any thing the citizen pretend 
but as I say what make this to the spoil 
of such a might city as this be 
unless we be confirm with more supply 

behold this scroll and be resolve in that 
from Mastricht first there come a thousand horse 
beside five hundred foot under the guide 
of don Alonzo de Verdugo then 
from L‚óèyre do Julian de Romero bring 
five hundred foot from Aelst two thousand more 
follow the conduct of Emanuel 
the duke of Alva likewise bring his power 
and for a better colour to delude 
these credulous inhabitant of Antwerp 
he cause it be publish he be dead 
and that his soldier guard his body hither 
to have it ship for Spain to be inter 
which well may serve to shadow his approach 
the rest by night shall have their entrance 
so that within two day I make account 
we shall be gather to a perfect head 
of at the least six thousand Spaniard 

I marry my lord this sound somewhat like 
now dare Cornelius promise victory 
but how intend your lordship to begin 
and give a entrance to this business 
you know the antwerpian never yet take part 
in any action against his majesty 
but have remain as neutral neither aid 
the prince of Orange nor offend you 
how will you then enkindle flame of war 
and take occasion to commence your quarrel 

why any way it shall be thus Cornelius 
I will charge the master gunner of the castle 
to make a shot or two upon the town 
and when they come to know the cause of it 
I will say it be because they do not sink 
the prince of Orange ship but suffer they 
to lie so near within the liver scale 
which not withstand we precise know 
do hover there about to no end else 
but to safe conduct victual to the town 
yet this excuse will serve to cloak our hate 
and show some reason for what after follow 

it can be but good my noble lord 
and short as their daily custom be 
change the governor and other burgher 
intend a solemn banquet at the statehouse 
Even then and at that place give you direction 
the gunner take his level it will affright 
and strike the great terror to their soul 

enough I will play they music to their meat 
and send such reveler into the room 
as some of they shall have carouse their last 
the most I crave be that Cornelius 
will be as constant as he have profess 

once more my lord I gauge my hand with you 
and as he be a soldier and a knight 
Cornelius vow to be a friend to Spain 

I take thy word fair knight and back again 
return the like to thou both I and i 
for ever vow to love and honour thou 
now break we off our secret conference 
and close as we come unto this place 
so let we circumspect make retreat 
walk thou into the town as if thou have 
but only come abroad to take the air 
I to the castle will withdraw myself 
down some back way and ever as we need 
be this our meeting place till Antwerp bleed 

farewell my lord Cornelius be agree 

what ordinance have you lade on that part 

a falcon and two Harguebuz of crock 

what tell thou i of Harguebuz of crock 
a pox upon your rascal squib and cracker 
have you be load all this day till now 
and come you with your Harguebuz of crock 
a plague upon it 

my lord blame your direction nevertheless 
not full assure of your lordship pleasure 
we have raise the cannon that come last from Harlam 
and plant they this morning for the purpose 

it be well advise but gunner for what part 

that be as it please your honour to direct 

that be for the statehouse gunner where the dutch 
sit swill in the pride of their excess 
commend we to they tell they we have send 
music to make they merry at their feast 
go bid thy fullmouthed cannon much good do it they 
shall we discharge some scurvy culver 
they will think we be about some firework 
to make they sport with 
for sure they fall asleep upon full stomach 
shoot i their statehouse through both the side 
and tell they thou do it for their health 
to keepe they wake 

I warrant you my lord I will pierce her side 
or never think i workman while I live 

I will not stir till I have hear the shot 
go light thy lintstock at some hellish brand 
to send black vengeance to that hate town 
let every corn of powder be a spirit 
thy mortal aim as ominous as death 
and never a splinter that the bullet strike 
but let it prove a very murder piece 
among the burgher at their banquet 
to vomit horrid plague upon they all 
there be thou like the club of Hercules 
among the bouse bacchanalian centure 
to beat their rhenish can about their ear 
good luck I hope hark how the sudden noise 
in counter with the cannon loud report 
stop his full mouth with the reverberate sound 
and fill the circle of the empty air 

the shot what from the castle questionless 

the smoke and the report may tell you so 

and certain intend at our life 

call to the governor 

he be walk here without the castle stay 
the citizen have send i to demand 
on what occasion or by who commandment 
you have discharge this shot upon the town 

at my command sir what be that to you

be devilish and unchristian 
which pass through the statehouse of the city 
have slay three person

or in their cup have fall to cut throat 
and fear that it will be noise abroad 
to cover your foul bestial gourmandize 
give it out to be a shot send from the castle 

that man be slay we will not expostulate 
but governor be it by your commandment 

tell i you man of Antwerp 
if you do startle at a cannon burst 
why suffer you the prince of Orange ship 
to ride upon the river at their pleasure 
and with their fleer top to mock our fame 
the while the sconce which do flank the river 
serve but for fisher to unload their net 
while canker rust devour your empty cannon 
and they lie hull up and down the stream 
burgher of Antwerp answer i to this 

they be of Zealand and the prince of Orange 
have ever be a friend unto the state 

but enemy unto the king my master 
therefore they shall not ride upon the river 
which if your own security do suffer 
we will make our bandog to awake your town 

be that the cause and reason of your shot 

Burger it be 

you shall have send we word of your dislike 

why so we do do we not send our post 
even now unto you 
And wrap our packet in a ball of lead 
I think we send a bold ambassador 
that speak our mind in thunder do he not 
you may before have know of our dislike 
but that we do perceive you will not see

that make you careless and neglect our power

well if ever man will have eat up the cannibal it be he

I be glad they have curse he into it 

well it be never hear that Dalva be dead 
but there be some notable villainy follow it

o the lord Verdugo and his regiment

my lord Romero where be don Emanuel 
to bring the power that we expect from Alst 

who be that lord sancto Danila 
he be enter on the other side the castle 
with all his power 

not yet full ten my mind presage good 
Antwerp ere night shall bathe herself in blood 

Monsieur champagne great Antwerp governor 
will you refuse these fair and fresh supply 
send from the prince of Orange and the state 
under our conduct for your city guard 

lord marquis Hawrye we reject they not 
nor yet neglect the love of that great prince 
and our kind friend the counited state 
but since we have no need of such a power 
why shall we pester Antwerp with such troop 
to spend the victual of the citizen 
which we can scarce compass now for gilt 

the prince and state will furnish you with store 
to feed the army and relieve the town 

it may be so 

and it may not be so 

outword and honour be engage for it 

under correction my lord governor 
the mark and count Egmont noble word 
although the prince of Orange and the state 
shall be forgetful be a pawn of worth 

what say the colonel of the Almain to it 

this be van end opinion my good lord 
that the rich promise of such noble peer 
as marquis hanurie and count Egmont be 
be pawn enough for all the city wealth 

the almain lie wealth be worth more than word 

I way their promise with my sound belief 
and tie my thought to their assure trust 
yet be there many reason of import 
to bar your army entrance to this town 

the grand objection be decide 

true 

the lesser than be easy refell 

suppose the prince and state do victual they 
yet their disorder in our civil street 
may be pernicious and breed mutiny 

by this supposal you enfeeble we 
and tax our worth with indiscretion 
as though our skill and our authority 
stand upon base of weak discipline 

we say not so and yet their riot 
may taint our wife and jeopardise our wealth 

in silence be it my lord you need they not 

all riot shall be death by martial law 
and all commander shall be vigilant 
over their troop that order may he keep 

my lord of Egmount and of Hawrye 
what be your number 

just 3000 foot 
one thousand horse 800 at the least 

a honourable tender of true friend 
to send such aid for safeguard of your city 

it will will shake our bag too much to pay so many 

at who expense shall all this army rest 

some part yourselves some part the prince will pay 

six hundred Almain be our garrison 
a guard sufficient to defend our wall 
and man enough because we need no more 

and they too many to be pay by we 

o may these slave refuse this succour send 
their misery shall bring their misery 

count Egmont sure Antwerp be bewitch 
security have slay their providence 
and riches make they reckless of their friend 
we must assume the charge upon ourselves 
and pray the prince and state to bear the pay 
or else their private avarice will pull 
public destruction on this flower of town 
to the disgrace of all the Netherlands 

I will make tender of so much to they 
two month the prince of Orange and the state 
and we ourselves will pay four thousand man 
if afterward our power be not of use 
we shall withdraw they to their province 
may this content you curious citizen 

the offer be so honourable now 
as modest we can challenge it 
captain Cornelius what be your counsel 

This 
say that you fear the Spaniard will conceive 
some high displeasure if you take they in 
my lord these fat purse peasant be so proud 
friend and defence be less esteem than pelf 

governor of Antwerp how be you resolve 

my lord the prince of Orange and yourselves 
and all the state deserve our duteous love 
and humble service first for send power 
then promise pay and victual for that power 
but with your pardon yet there be a let 
that make we loath to take your army in 

what let champagne 

the spanish governor 
Danila commander of the castle here 
if we receive your troop into our town 
will judge we have some purpose of revolt 
and raise arm against the king of Spain 

what if he do 

his fiery spirit inflame 
will send our bullet from the citadel 
and tear the sumptuous building of our town 

as late he do when we be banquet 
and think no harm but drink health to health 
he shoot and slay some innocent poor soul 
and rent our statehouse and some building else 

he will rend you better if our purpose hold 

what be the cause 

because we do not sink 
the prince of Orange ship that lie to waft 
provision to our city up the river 

observe by that you discreet governor 
what love or faith the Spaniard hold with you 
that for his pride will have your city pine 
have destroy the corn on Flaunders side 
and cross a bridge of convoy to your town 
then that the river shall not victual you 
he wish you sink that ship in the skelt 

collect by this the Spaniard cruelty 
who though occasion shall not come from you 
will pick a quarrel for occasion 
to sack your city and to suck your blood 
to satisfy his pride and luxury 
let Harlem Mastricht alst example you 
and many city model of his wrath 
think on my father and the county horn 
who tragedy if I recount with ruth 
may move the stone of Antwerp to relent 
they serve the Spaniard as his liegeman swear 
yet for they do but wish their country good 
he pick a quarrel and cut off their head 
burgher the Spaniard wait to take your life 
that he may spoil your town your wealth your wife 

receive your friend prevent his treachery 
lest unaware you taste his tyranny 

what benefit good countryman gain we 
that prostitute our fortune and our blood 
in your defence 

say shall we let they in 

in troth I think the Spaniard mean no harm 

mean what he may we will not offend such friend 
as these the prince of Orange and the state 
your army be at Kibdorpe port you say 

there stay our force 

we will let they in 
and quarter they with all convenient speed 
van end draw up your Almain to one place 
and keep good rule for fear of civil brawl 
and now my lord I will attend on you 

I will attend to look and guard my door 
and keep my wealth my wife and daughter safe 
for fear these hungry soldier get a snatch 

younker come here haste to the castle wall 
and call to speak with sancto Danila 
tell he from i the fly begin to swarm 
the sun grow hot the herd do shake their horn 
the shepherd bring great flock home to the fold 
say if the butcher slaughter not in time 
the beast will surfeit and the soldier pine 
therefore begin before one glass be run 
and we shall win ere set of the sun 
remember this be secret and away 
now Antwerp come the Spaniard holiday 
with they join I my share be in the gold 
I run with the hare and with the hound I hold 
this Sunday shall be dismal to the town 
the burgher die their gallant wife go down 

afore good wife I fear that all be not well 
monsieur champagne what be your opinion 

doubtless the Spaniard do intend some hurt 
hark how the tumult still increase 

for shame 
be not so fearful say that for some offence 
either commence or but in conceit 
the Spaniard be malicious incline 
have you not soldier to withstand their force 
what shall you need to be solicitous 
keep you within 

nay wife thou do mistake 
if thou imagine we intend to fight 
it be not our meaning we be at the charge 
to pay they monthly wherefore shall not they 
be at the care to see the city safe 

the city be safe enough without their care 
will you to dinner 

wherefore shoot they thus 
unless there be some villainy abroach 

wherefore shoot they but to try their piece 
I warrant you husband it be no otherwise 

here come the mark he can tell the news 

the cause my lord of this intestine uproar 

the cause be murder misery and death 
you man of Antwerp if with all the speed 
and expedition that in man remain 
you take not weapon to repulse the foe 
that like a swarm of deadly sting hornet 
have all this while lie hide within their nest 
but now do fly abroad with dreadful noise 
as if so many fury be awake 
to arm then all that love your country peace 

how do you mean my lord or who be those 
your lordship shadow underneath the name 
of swarm hornet 

be you so dull offence 
and still so lull in your security 
who shall I mean but bloody Danila 
and furious Alva his compeer in arm 
that fill the castle yard with their battalion 
and strive to take possession of your street 
to arm then straight if you will keep they back 

be it like that Alva be revive again 

as like as he intend to take the town 

but I suspect there be some treachery 

will you believe his word he do but jest 
to try how we will take it if it be so 

nay by his look and by his sudden haste 
it shall appear the mark do not jest 

to arm to arm o where be the governor 
give order that your citizen prepare 
to stand upon their guard defend themselves 
for who you trust turn his weapon point 
upon your bosom all the Almaigne force 
be quite revolt and the enemy 
enter your street van end that damn slave 
give aid to Spain and with his traitorous hand 
draw in destruction if you look not to it 

where be the Swisser shall supply the trench 

drink in their lodging and in reel forth 
the Spaniard unresisted murder they 
for honour sake for wretched Antwerp sake 
stand not amaze but with courageous heart 
and forward hand fight for your liberty 

be yet your eyelid open be you yet 
awake out of the slumber you be in 
or will you still lie snort in your sloth 
be still persuade you be safe enough 
until the very instant you do feel 
their naked sword glide through your weasondpipe 
or do you think with belch Puff that fly 
from your full paunch you can blow they back 
or be the bottom of a deep carouse 
able to drown they will their fury melt 
at the behold of your dainty wife 
or can submission be a stickler 
in these hot brawl I tell you burgher no 
fair word will be as oil to burn pitch 
and gold as sulphur to enkindle flame 
your daughter chastity must quench their lust 
and your dear wife enrich their lawless arm 
I say as much but will not be believe 
now tell i if I prophesy aright 
or that my zealous word deserve rebuke 
do I not say the crocodile do weep 
but to obtain his prey the sea look smooth 
but for a storm will any thing be think 
by the close confluence of the spanish troop 
into the castle but some massacre 
yet be I rate to object as much 
revile and baffle for my loyalty 

I prithee soldier lean thy bitter word 
and help to fight for Antwerpes liberty 

you have another groat to give i then 
I know your liberal mind will scorn to impose 
the sweat of bloody danger on the brow 
of any man but you will reward he for it 
he shall at least when he have lose his limb 
be send for harbour to a spittlehouse 
How say you shall he not good reason then 
but we shall venture yes to laugh at you 
while we behold the Spaniard cut your throat 
a object base mechanic set awork 
a sweaty cobbler who best industry 
be but to clout a shoe shall have his fee 
but let a soldier that have spend his blood 
be lame disease or any way distress 
appeal for succour than you look a sconce 
as if you know he not respect more 
a ostler or some drudge that rake your kennel 
than one that fight for the common wealth 

it be thy country that do bind thou to it 
not any imposition we exact 

bind i my country with no great bond 
than for a groat to fight then for a groat 
to be enfeeble or to lose a limb 
poor groatsworth of effection well I will learn 
to pay my debt and to measure my desert 
accord to the rate a groat I have 
and so much as a groat amount unto you 
my sword shall pay you in exchange of blow 

citizen how now 

o monsieur champagne 
we be undo for want of discipline 

the Spaniard hurry into every street 
what shall we do for safeguard of our life 

what shall you do stand every man at his door 
and take in his hand a Holbert or brown bill 
and study to defend he as he may 

I hear they come let we shift away 

marquis d' Hawrie stay thou can not escape 

and stay count Egmont Danila conquer sword 
pursue thy life therefore abide and yield it 

insatiate Alva that like sunrise ground 
never suffice with sweet shower that fall 
but with a thousand mouth gape still for more 
So thy desire of blood never satisfy 
with the rich tribute of so many life 
who guiltless blood have dye poor Belgius check 
and change she like a drunken bacchanal 
still with a thousand quenchless appetite 
do thirst for more as if that epithet 
be the sole object of thy heart best hope 
know tyrant marquis Hawrie fly thou not 
as fear all the uttermost thou can 
but the oppression of unequal power 
false treason that betray our life to thou 
and the sharp scourge that fond security 
have just throw on Antwerpes wilfulness 

these be the sluice that have bring on we 
the swell pride and tyranny of Spain 
which Antwerp careless off although forewarn 
by many bleed instance about she 
can not nay will not be advise at all

upon her neighbour city war keen edge 
have furrow through their entrails let they blood

but warm she at their fire sing at their sigh 
revel in her countless vanity 
as a perpetual date be set thereon 
tell i I say you that have see all this 
and as devil saint in the black calendar 
of wretched woe may true be set down 
as author of these sad confusion 
do not you deem that state well worth the ill 
that this remissness bring upon the rest 

they can but confess so much count Egmont 

if this be grant what be your glory then 
a arm man to kill a naked soul 
a thousand sickle thrust into a field 
of summer ripen and resistless corn

where no defence or bank to keep it back 
this be your honour this their misery 
that be not conquer but die wilful 

war take hold on all advantage 

what need advantage where be no resist 

so much the better this be our discipline 
therefore submit or die

graybearded father nor the babe that suck 
one Spaniard blood I value better worth 
than many hundred of these drunken dutch

that every one may know his privilege 

Well think upon Verdugo thus it shall be 
the burse the statehouse and the market place 
belong to i the castle and that side 
to sancto Danila on the other hand 
the key and waterport Verdugo be you

of England be you what although you be 
back slave unto the door from whence you come 
and on your knee solicit Alua greatness 
if you do look for mercy at his hand 

back when he bid you now down upon your knee 
and crawl unto his presence to beg life 

Verdugo drag he by the long tail beard 
Alva do scorn to wait upon their leisure 

Come forward with a pox now speak your mind 
and speak discreet lest you speak your last 

this cruelty be more than we deserve 
and more than we expect will be show

you shall have cause 

nay hear they speak my lord 

what can they say to shield themselves from death 

nothing my lord if in your angry spleen 
you have already pass your sentence on we 
but will the duke of Alva cool his rage 
and mild hear we we will say my lord 
that England league with Spain king Phillip word 
pass to our gracious mistress be enough 
to warrant all the life of any such 
as be her subject in this wretched town 
and not their life alone but safe protection 
both for their good and money but if now 
your highness have commission to break 
the holy contract which your king have make 
we must be patient and abide the worst 

why what be thou that stand upon the league

yet understand not how the league be make 
so long as you converse not with the foe 
of royal Philip nor withstand his right 
you be exempt the rigour of his scourge 
but be here in this rebellious town 
you must partake the punishment they feel 

we be not here great lord to join with they 
in any bold confederacy of war 
but for the traffic which all nation else 
as well as England have within this place 

why leave you not the city then perceive 
we mean to call their duty to account 

we have no sign of any such intent 

you can so be quit nor so excuse 
therefore provide before tomorrow night 
to bring unto we forty thousand crown 
for ransom of your house or if you fail 
both good and life shall all be forfeit 
so much we be content to yield unto 
because we will not seem to break the league

So be the cat that dally with the mouse 
but in the end her pastime be his death

and better that we quench it with our gold 
than let they swallow and carouse our blood 
I prithee Godfrey try thy friend abroad 
and any money that thou have bring forth 
that we may make the sum which he desire 

I will do the best I can though hard it be 
to find a friend in this extremity

the soul of he who spirit already stoop 
under the heavy burden of weak age 
you have my treasure what more can you crave 

thy life if so we please there yet remain 
a jewel of more worth than all thy wealth

but show he where thy daughter do abide

of my command a nunnery in the arm 
of her religious peaceful privilege 
do clip her silly fright virgin life 
from whence my lord she can be recall 

bear art upon thy tongue that may unlock 
the gate of that in close sanctuary 
and first entreat but if entreaty fail 
then use command if neither will prevail 
yet so thou shall not cease but in the cord 
of violent fury drag the damsel thence 
my soldier shall attend to see it do 
that if thou shrink their weapon naked point 
may gorge thy side till thou bleed out thy life 

I will that sacrifice may end this strife 

away with he love faint through cold delay

to make my ransom be now carry it 
to mighty Alva to redeem my life 

what value be it 

full five hundred dollar 

be this the utmost penny thou can make 

the length and depth of my ability 

it will not serve to search thy chest for more 
or bide the torture we impose on such 
as cunning withhold what we demand 

there be not in the world that I may call 
right i own one stiver or one doit 
more than be there comprise within that bag

or sink into some well or bury deep 
within the earth so hoist the peasant up 
now let he down will you confess as yet 
where we may find the treasure you have hide 

that which my lord be not can be hide 
and to say that I know not will but wrong 
your expectation and deceive myself

and open mine of treasure to my soul 
welcome fair sweet my arm shall be thy throne 
where seat once mock death and laugh to scorn

who while he show wild Frisco in the street 
and with his gambols overthrow huge building 
mingle their totter ruin with the limb 
and clot blood of many thousand soul 
shall as a antic in thy sight appear

soil with dissolve drop of sorrow rage 
if i you touch with a lascivious hand 
as from his eye descend a flood of tear 
so will you draw a river from his heart 
of his life blood both way you shall obscure 
the honour of your name if virgin I 
or age he misdo by tyranny 

let conquest satisfy since in the strength 
of your successful power our city vail 
and lie in prostrate duty at your foot 
or if not conquest be appease with gold 
which in abundance plead for our release 
only refrain our conscience to wound 
with that for which there be no physic find 

I be impatient she shall be my love

of grave experience as they may have do 
and have you be more rich in inward gift 
and less magnificent in outward show

o that I be in the bottom of my seller

no true sir 
but then I hope I shall not hang by the thumb 

he dally with we tickle he a good 

o God God what shall I do sweet gentleman 

confess then sirrah 

o lord I shall sound 
by these ten end I have nor plate nor coin 
your general and countryman have all 

what have we here a Burger tie by the thumb

that will not give a penny to a soldier 
I know he well now sir how feel yourself 

o gentleman never so much distress 

your greasy paunch will not defend you then 

not from these Spaniard they be devil I think 
nay far more covetous than devil of hell 

you can satisfy they with a groat 
but if I shall requite thy vild contempt 
here shall I leave thou that as thy treasure 
have be a prey to their devour lust 
so in this dunghill of thy carrion flesh 
their ravenous sword may find a dirty feast 
for nought but draff be thou compose of 
nor fit for any thing but to feed worm 
yet thou shall find a difference betwixt my thought 
and the base temper of thy muddy mind 
go live if thou can escape their bloody hand 
till want and beggary cut short thy day 

I thank you sir I have for all their threat 
one bag of dollar cast into a well 
and that I will give you for this friendly succour 

hence tumbril from my sight when bounty may 
have calm my sharp affliction than thy hand 
be fast close up but now it be too late 
thou will seem prodigal away base churl 

let i entreat you sir to take that sum

will thou leave off thy prate and be go 

with all my heart sir and I thank you too 

how like Leviathan his clumsy limb 
walk not but tumble that sad common wealth 
nurse such drone to suck her honey up 
in time of need shall find as small supply 
as he have be to Antwerp wretchedness 
but valiant soldier what be now to do 

what but to hunt the footstep of pale death 
until we rouse he in his sooty cave 
there will no prospect of our country fall 
offend our eyesight there no treachery 
of haughty Spaniards tread a bloody march 
nor any base objection of ingrate 
and thankless citizen sit in our door 
but we shall quiet enjoy the peace 
for which we breathe there shall we be secure 
there free from thought of this world misery 
and there indeed find true felicity 
for there our travel shall be recompense 
our love requite and our wound repay 
with double merit haste then unto the place 
upon the earth be nothing but disgrace 

I fly with thou true honourable mind 
and we together will that mansion find 

see captain now I have it on my breast 
the honourable cognisance of death 
this purple river from this weep fount 
more glad and quicken my decay spirit 
than ever Christ all spring in heat of summer 
the weary traveller his strength revive 
to draw out tedious hour still on earth 
but i do flourish to possess anon 
the bless haven of eternity 

I trust I shall be there with as much speed 
my passport I do think the Spaniard 
have seal as deep and my journey lay 
with no less easy travel to be there 
see if thy bleed wound can speak to i 
my can as fast make answer unto thou 

let i embrace this sweet affinity 
like in our life agree in our death 
but what do I behold thy eyelid faint 
and the warm touch of thy desire cheek 
begin to freeze will thou anticipate 
those joy before i gentle captain slay 
there be but a minute that divide our hope 
o he be dead may his depart soul 
usher my spirit above those fleet cloud 
death why delay thou set thy lazy hand 
to the divorcement of my loathe flesh 
I be prepare my penitent sad thought 
have long ago wash my contagious sin 
the blood that I have spill the massacre 
procure and practise by this hand of i 
heaven lay not to my charge for though my sword 
be never draw but in a rightful cause 
yet much misprision have attend it 
that and all else this sigh crave pardon for 
my eye be near accustom to tear 
let it suffice these wound do weep for they 
Antwerp farewell if thou have do i wrong 
this late gasp send pardon from my tongue 

now war have wrap his bloody colour up 
and sheathe his fatal sword with he we we 
prefix truce to our laborious arm 
this city late of christen the fame 
for wealth and glory now remain the map 
of sad destruction and perpetual ruin 
Her street lie thwack with slaughter carcase 
her house that before be stuff with pride 
be left as naked as the wilderness 
o in remorse of human clemency 
my heart not think can sigh my eye shed tear 
to call to mind and see their misery 
but they be wanton and lascivious 
too much addict to their private lust 
and that conclude their martyrdom be just 
hold one of you convey this serious letter 
to warlike Alva tell he as he will 
after my force lodge in garrison 
I will meet his grace at bridge and from thence 
acquaint the court of Spain with our success 
pray God the tyranny express in Antwerp 
like to the echo clamour of a trumpet 
speak not our deed before our own approach 

my lord behold where lie the mangle body 
of those two fierce assail brabanter 
that all this while keep we at such a bay 
and when we think the town be win procure 
so great a deluge of Iberian blood 

let we drag they at our horse tail my lord 
and as we pass through every town and village 
make they example to the world for pride 

who touch they but in disgrace my sword 
shall lop his arm off be they proud say thou 
their pride be honourable deserve love 
rather than hate nay shall we do they right 
have they be strengthen with convenient aid 
we have be beat from the town again 
and make exchange of conquest which subdue 
there never live two more heroic spirit 
that for their country have deserve as much 
to be renown as ever Curtius be 
or roman Decius or the two valiant Cocles 
they for their country can but lose their life 
these have inequal service do as much 
take up their body of ten thousand other 
rest by our sword and leave unburied 
these two will we in person see inter 
and do they right the law of arm require 
so march we hence strike a mournful sound 
till we have say our honour foe in ground 

thus worldling time in his unwonted love 
have stay his course to rub the memory 
of action long since cast behind his back 
his care be fruitful and do wish to see 
no heavy or disastrous chance befall 
the son of man if they will warn be 
but when they spurn against my discipline 
waste the treasure of my precious hour 
no marvel then like misery catch hold 
on they do fasten o this woeful town 
who bleed fortune who lament cries 
who street besmear with blood who blubber eye 
who totter wall who building overthrow 
who riches lose and poverty make know 
may be a mean all city to affright 
how they in sin and pleasure take delight
