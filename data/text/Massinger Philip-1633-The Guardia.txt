and you will not approve 

out with it man 

his rash endeavour without your consent 
to match himself into a family

and will you stand conceal 
among these tree for he must pass this green 
the matin end as she return home

I thank you this torrent must be stop

I know I wrong my modesty 

and wrong i 
in be so importunate for that 
I neither can nor must grant 

a hard sentence and to increase my misery by you 
who fond affection have make my judge 
pronounce without compassion Alas sir 
do I approach you with unchaste desire 
a sully reputation be deform 
as it may be I be though many affirm 
I be something more than handsome 

I dare swear it 

or if I be no gentlewoman but breed coarse 
you may with some pretence of reason slight 
what you shall sue for 

be he not a eunuch 
he will and sue again I be sure I shall 
pray look in my collar a flea trouble i 
heyday there be a legion of young Cupid 
at barleybreak in my breech

only vouchsafe to let i understand 
what my defect be of which once convince 
I will hereafter silence my harsh plea 
and spare your further trouble 

I will tell you and blunt as my usual manner be 
though I be a womanhater which I be not 
but love the sex for my end take i with you 
if in my thought I find one taint or blemish 
in the whole fabric of your outward feature 
I will give myself the lie you be a virgin 
possess of all your mother can wish in you 
your father severino dire disaster 
in kill of your uncle which I grieve for 
in no part take from you I repeat it 
a noble virgin for who grace and favour 
the italian prince may contend as rival 
yet unto i a thing far far beneath you 
a note libertine I profess myself 
in your mind there do appear one fault so gross 
nay I may say unpardonable at your year 
if just you consider it that I can 
as you desire affect you 

make i know it I will soon reform it 

will you will keep your word 

put i to the test 

I will you be too honest 
and like your mother too strict and religious 
and talk too soon of marriage I shall break 
if at that rate I purchase you can I part with 
my uncurbed liberty and on my neck 
wear such a heavy yoke hazard my fortune 
with all the expect joy my life can yield i 
for one commodity before I prove it 
Venus forbid on both side let crooked ham 
bald head decline shoulder furrow cheek 
be awe by ceremony if you love i 
in the way young people shall I will fly to meet it 
and we will meet merry 

it be strange such a man can use such language 

in my tongue my heart 
speak free fair one think upon it a close friend 
or private mistress be courtrhetoric 
a wife mere rustic solecism so good morrow 

how like you this 

a wellbred gentleman

or drink I meet his mother he must have 
some drop of my blood in he for at his year 
I be much of his religion 

out upon you 

the colt tooth still in your mouth 

what mean this whisper 

you may perceive I seek not to displant you 
where you desire to grow for further thank 
it be needless compliment 

there be some nature 
which blush to owe a benefit if not 
receive in corner hold it a impair 
to their own worth shall they acknowledge it 
I be make of other clay and therefore must 
trench so far on your leisure as to win you 
to lend a patient ear while I profess 
before my glory though your scorn caliste 
how much I be your servant 

my design be not so urgent but they can dispense 
with so much time

your suit offend as much as his repulse 
it be not to be grant 

hear he madam 
his sorrow be not personate he deserve 
your pity not contempt 

he have make the maid his 
and as the master of the art of love 
wise affirm it be a kind of passage 
to the mistress favour 

I come not to urge 
my merit to deserve you since you be 
weigh true to your worth above all value 
much less to argue you of want of judgement 
for follow one that with wing foot fly from you 
while I at all part without boast his equal 
in vain pursue you bring those flame with i 
those lawful flame for madam know with other 
I never shall approach you which Adorio 
in scorn of Hymen and religious rite 
with atheistical impudence contemn 
and in his loose attempt to undermine 
the fortress of your honour seek to ruin 
all holy altar by clear mind erect 
to virginhonor 

my nephew be a ass 
what a devil have he to do with virginhonor 
altar or lawful flame when he shall tell she 
they be superstitious nothing and speak to the purpose 
of the delight to meet in the old dance 
between a pair of sheet my grandam call it 
the people of the world

dovelike innocence render you 
insensible of a injury for which 
I deep suffer can you undergo 
the scorn of be refuse I must confess 
it make for my end for have he embrace 
your gracious offer tender he I have be 
in my own hope forsake and if yet 
there can breathe any air of comfort in i 
to his contempt I owe it but his ill 
no more shall make way for my good intent

the aid of vice 

you take that licence sir which yet I never grant 

I will force more nor will I for my own end undertake it 
as I will make apparent but to do 
a justice to your sex with my own wrong 
and irrecoverable loss to thou I turn

This take as a preparative to strengthen 
your queasy stomach vault into your saddle 
with all this flesh I can do it without a stirrup

for we will have variety of delight 
we will to the field again no game shall rise 
but we will be ready for it if a hare my greyhound 
shall make a course for the pie or Jay a Sparhawk 
fly from the fist the crow so near pursue 
shall be compel to seek protection under 
our horse belly a Hearn put from her siege 
and a Pistol shoot off in her breech shall mount 
so high that to your view she will seem to soar 
above the middle region of the air 
a cast of haggard falcon by i mane 
eye the prey at first appear as if 
they do turn tail but with their labour wing 
get above she with a thought their pinion 
cleave the pure element make in 
and by turn bind with she the fright fowl 
lie at her defence upon her back 
with her dreadful beak a while defer her death 
but by degree force down we part the fray 
and feast upon she 

this can be I grant but pretty pastime

without offence in the way of counsel to you 
I can allege and true that your purpose 
for Naples cover with a thin disguise 
be full of danger 

danger Claudio 
it be here and everywhere our force companion 
the rise and the set sun behold we 
environ with it our whole life a journey 
end in certain ruin 

yet we shall not however besiege deliver up our fort 
of life till it be force 

it be so indeed by wise man conclude which we shall 
obey as Christian but when I consider 
how different the progress of our action 
be from religion nay morality 
I can find in reason why we shall 
be scrupulous that way only or like meteor 
blaze forth prodigious terror till our stuff 
be utter consume which once put out 
will bring security unto ourselves 
and safety unto those we prey upon 
o Claudio since by this fatal hand 
the brother of my wife bold Monteclaro 
be leave dead in the field and I proscribe 
after my flight by the justice of the king 
my being have be but a live death 
with a continue torture 

yet in that you do delude their bloody violence 
that do pursue your life 

while I by rapine live terrible to other as myself 
what one hour can we challenge as our own 
unhappy as we be yield a beam 
of comfort to we quiet night that bring 
rest to the labourer be the outlaw day 
in which he rise early to do wrong 
and when his work be end dare not sleep 
our time be spend in watch to entrap 
such as will shun we and to hide ourselves 
from the minister of justice that will bring we 
to the correction of the law o Claudio 
be this a life to be preserve and at 
so dear a rate but why hold I discourse 
on this sad subject since it be a burden 
we be mark to bear and not to be shake off 
but with our humane frailty in the change 
of danger there be some delight and therefore 
I be resolve for Naples 

may you meet there 
all comfort that so fair and chaste a wife 
as fame proclaim she without parallel 
can yield to ease your sorrow 

I much thank you 
yet you may spare those wish which with joy 
I have prove certainty and from their want 
her excellency take lustre 

ere you go yet 
some charge unto your squire not to fly out 
beyond their bound be not impertinent 
for though that with a look you can command they 
in your absence they will be headstrong

to save one citizen be a great prize 
than to have kill in war ten enemy
