And o if ever time create a muse 
that to the immortal fame of virgin faith 
dare once engage his pen to write her death 
present it in some black tragedy 
may it prove gracious may his style be deck 
with fresh bloom of pure elegance 
may it have gentle presence and the scene suck up 
by calm attention of choice audience 
and when the close epilogue appear 
in stead of clap may it obtain but tear
