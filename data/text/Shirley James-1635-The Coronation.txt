I wait upon you sir 

the queen look pleasant 
this morning do she not 

I ever find 
her gracious smile on i 

she do consult 
her safety in it for I must tell thou boy 
but in the assurance of her love to thou 
I shall advance thy hope another way 
and use the power I have in Epire to 
settle our own and uncontrolled greatness 
but since she carry herself so fair 
I be content to expect and by her marriage 
secure thy fortune that be all my ambition 
now be still careful in thy application 
to she I must attend other affair 
return and use what be thou can to lay 
more charm of love upon she 

I presume 
she always speak the language of her heart 
and I can be ambitious for no more 
happiness on earth than she encourage 
i to expect 

it be a act become 
the wisdom of her father to engage 
a tie between our family and she 
have play her best discretion to allow it 
but we lose time in conference wait on she 
and be what thou be bear for king of Epire exit 
I must away 

success ever attend you 
be not the queen yet come forth 

your servant 
you may command our duty 
this be the court star Philocles 

the star that we must sail by 

all must borrow 
a light from he the young queen direct all 
her favour that way 

he be a noble gentleman 
and worthy of his expectation 
too good to be the son of such a father 

peace remember he be lord protector 

we have more need of heaven protection 
in the mean time I wonder the old king 
do in his life design he for the office 

he may suspect his faith I have hear when 
the king who be no epirot advance 
his claim Cassander our protector now 
young then oppose he tough with his faction 
but force to yield have fair condition 
and be declare by the whole state next heir 
if the king want issue our hope only 
thrive in this daughter 

who but for her smile 
and hope of marriage with Lisimachus 
his father by some cunning have remove 
ere this 

take heed the arras may have ear 
I shall not weep much if his grace will hence 
remove to heaven 

I prithee what shall he do there 

some office will fall 

and the sky too ere I get one stair high 
while he be in place 

Lisander Philocles 
how look the day upon we where be the queen 

in her bedchamber 

who be with she 

none but the young lord Lysimachus 

it be no treason 
if a man wish himself a courtier 
of such a possibility he have 
the mount fate 

I will his father be 
mount to the gallows 

he have a path fair enough 
if he survive by title of his father 

the queen will hasten his ascent 

will I wear queen 

thou will become rare the petticoat 
what will thou do 

why I will marry 
my gentleman usher and trust all the strength 
and burden of my state upon his leg 
rather than be call wife by any son 
of such a father 

come let we leave this subject 
we may find more secure discourse when see 
you young Arcadius lord Macarius nephew 

there be a spark a youth mould for a favourite 
the queen may do he honour 

favourite it be too cheap a name there be a match 
now for her virgin blood 

must every man 
that have a hansome face or leg feed such 
ambition I confess I honour he 
he have a nimble soul and give great hope 
to be no womanhater dance handsome 
can court a lady powerful but more go 
to the make of a prince he be here 
and his uncle 

save you gentleman who can direct i 
to find my lord protector 

he be here 
within this half hour young Lisimachus 
his son be with the queen 

there let he compliment 
I have other business ha Arcadius 

observe you with what eye Arcadius 
and he salute their two family 
will hardly reconcile 

Seleucus carry 
himself too rough with what pride and scorn 
he pass by they 

the other with less show 
of anger carry pride enough in his soul 
I wish they all at peace Macarius look 
be without civil war a good old man 
the old king love he well Seleucus father 
be as dear to he and maintain the character 
of a honest lord through Epire that two man 
so love of other shall be so unwelcome 
to one another 

the queen be not wont to send for i 

the reason be to herself 
it will become your duty to attend she 

save you gentleman what novelty 
do the court breath today 

None sir the news 
that take the last impression be that you 
purpose to leave the kingdom and those man 
that honour you take no delight to hear it 

I have ambition to see the difference 
of court and this may spare the delight 
at home do surfeit and the mistress who 
we all do serve be fix upon one object 
her beam be too much point but no country 
shall make i lose your memory 

Arcadius

I have no blessing in his absence 

it be do like a pious uncle 

we must not 
give any licence 

if your majesty 
will please

to have first acquaint we ere you declare 
your resolution public be our court

take a philter 

nay pray be cover ceremony from you 
must be excuse 

it will become my duty 

not your love 
I know you will not have i look upon 
your person as a courtier not as favourite 
that title be too narrow to express 
how we esteem you 

the least of all 
these name from you madam be grace enough 

yet here you will not rest 

not if you please 
to say there be a happiness beyond 
and teach my ambition how to make it i 
although the honour you already have 
let fall upon your servant exceed all 
my merit I have a heart be studious 
to reach it with desert and make if possible 
your favour i by justice with your pardon 

we be confident this needs no pardon sir 
but a reward to cherish your opinion 
and that you may keep warm your passion 
know we resolve for marriage and if 
I have another gift beside myself 
great in that you shall discern how much 
my heart be fix 

let i digest my blessing 

but I can resolve when this shall be 

how madam do not make i dream of heaven 
and wake i into misery if your purpose 
be to immortalize your humble servant 
your power on earth divine prince be here 
the copy of eternity and create 
when they but will our happiness 

I shall 
believe you mock i in this argument 
I have no power 

how no power 

not as a queen 

I understand you not 

I must obey your father my protector 

how 

when I be absolute Lysimachus 
our power and title meet before we be but 
a shadow and to give you that be nothing 

excellent queen 
my love take no original from state 
or the desire of other greatness 
above what my birth may challenge modest 
I love your virtue mercenary soul 
be take with advancement you have a empire 
within you better than the world to that 
look my ambition 

other be not fit 
to be despise cosmography allow 
Epire a place in the map and know till I 
possess what I be bear to and alone 
do grasp the kingdom sceptre I account 
myself divide he that marry i 
shall take a absolute queen to his warm bosom 
my temple yet be naked until then 
our love can be but compliment and wish 
yet very hearty one 

I apprehend 

your father 

madam a gentleman have a humble suit 

it be in your power to grant you be protector 
I be not yet a queen 

how be this 

I shall expound her meaning 

why kneel you sir 

madam to reconcile two family 
that may unite both counsel and their blood 
to serve your crown 

Macarius and Eubulus 
that by be inveterate malice to each other 
it grow as I have hear upon the question 
which some of either family have make 
which of their father be the best commander 
if we believe our story they have both 
deserve well of our state and yet this quarrel 
have cost too many life a severe faction 

but I will propound a way to plant a quiet 
and peace in both our house which be tear 
with their dissension and lose the glory 
of their great name my blood speak my relation 
to Eubulus and I wish my vein be empty 
to appease their war 

thou have a noble soul 
this be a charity above thy youth 
and it flow brave from thou name the way 

in such a desperate cause a little stream 
of blood may purge the foulness of their heart 
if you will prevent a deluge 

be particular 

let but your majesty consent that two 
may with their personal valour undertake 
the honour of their family and determine 
their difference 

this rather will enlarge 
their hate and be a mean to call more blood 
into the stream 

not if both family 
agree and swear 

and who shall be the champion 

I beg the honour for Eubulus cause 
to be engage if any for Macarius 
worthy to wager heart with i accept it 
I be confident Arcadius 
for honour will direct I to his sword 
will not deny to stake against my life 
his own if you vouchsafe we privilege 

you be the expectation and top bough 
of both your house it will seem injustice 
to allow a civil war to cut you off 
and yourselves the instrument beside 
you appear a soldier Arcadius 
have no acquaintance yet with rugged war 
more fit to drill a lady then expose 
his body to such danger a small wound 
in the head may spoil the method of his hair 
who curiosity exact more time 
than his devotion and who know but he 
may lose his ribbon by it in his lock 
dear as his saint with who he will exchange 
his head for her gay colour then his band 
may be disorder and transform from lace 
to cutwork his rich clothes be discomplexion 
with blood beside the unfashionable slash 
and at the next festival take physic 
or put on black and mourn for his slay breech 
his hand case up in glove all night and sweat 
pomatum the next day may be endanger 
to blister with a sword how can he stand 
upon his guard who have fiddler in his head 
to which his foot must ever be a dance 
beside a falsify may spoil his cringe 
or make of a leg in which consist 
much of his court perfection 

be this character 
bestow on he 

it something may concern the gentleman 
who if you please to challenge 
to dance play on the lute or sing 

some catch 

he shall not want those will maintain he 
for any sum 

you be my sovereign 
I dare not think yet I must speak somewhat 
I shall burst else I have no skill in jig 
nor tumbling 

how sir 

nor be I bear a minstrel and in this you have 
so infinite disgrace Arcadius 
but that I have hear another character 
and with your royal licence do believe it 
I shall not think he worth my kill 

your kill 

do she not jeer i 
I shall talk treason present I find it 
at my tongue end already this be a 
affront I will leave she 

Come back do you know Arcadius 

I have change but little breath with he our person 
admit no familiarity we be 
bear to live both at distance yet I have see he 
fight and fight brave 

when the spirit of wine 
make his brain valiant he fight brave 

although he be my enemy shall any 
of the gay fly that buzz about the court 
sit to catch trout in the summer tell i so 
I dare in any presence but your own 

what 

tell he he be not honest 

I see Seleucus thou be resolute 
and I but wrong Arcadius your first 
request be grant you shall fight and he 
that conquer be reward to confirm 
first place and honour to his family

with much ado 

I wish thy sword may open 
his wanton vein Macarius be too popular 
and have teach he to insinuate

and ripen the delight of marriage Seleucus

bedfellow for the protector let he pray for

Lysimachus 

what heretofore can happen to mankind 
be with much pain to climb to heaven but in 
Sophia marriage of all queen the best 
heaven will come down to earth to make i bless 

Indeed you shall not go

of thy departure with no comfort thou

but I must thank the queen now for thy company 
I prithee what can make thou so desirous 
to be abroad 

only to get a appetite 
to thou Polidora

thy luster want the admiration here 
there thou wot shine indeed and strike a reverence 
into the gazer 

you can flatter too 

no praise of thou can be think so thy virtue 
will deserve all I must confess we courtier 
do oftentimes commend to show our art 
there be necessity sometime to say 
this madam breath arabian gum 
amber and cassia though while we be praise 
we wish we have no nostril to take in 
the offensive steam of her corrupt lung 
nay some will swear they love their mistress 
will hazard life and fortune to preserve 
one of her hair bright than Berenice 
or young Apollo and yet after this 
a favour from another toy will tempt he 
to laugh while the officious hangman whip 
her head off 

fine man 

I be none of these 
nay there be woman Polidora too 
that can do pretty well at flattery 
make man believe they dote will languish for they 
can kiss a jewel out of one and dally 
a carcanet of diamond from another 
weep into the bosom of a three and make 
he drop as many pearl they count it nothing 
to talk a reasonable heir within ten day 
out of his whole estate and make he mad 
he have no more wealth to consume 

you will teach i 
to think I may be flatter in your promise 
since you live where this art be most profess 

I dare not be so wicked Polidora 
the infant error of the court I may 
be guilty off but never to abuse 
so rare a goodness nor indeed do ever 
converse with any of those shame of court 
to practise for base end be confident 
my heart be full of thou and I so deep 
carry the figure of my Polidora 
it be not in the power of time or distance 
to cancel it by all that be bless I love thou 
love thou above all woman dare invoke 
a curse when I forsake thou 

let it be some 
gentle one 

teach i a oath I prithee 
one strong enough to bind if thou do find 
any suspicion of my faith or else 
direct i in some horrid imprecation 
when I forsake thou for the love of other 
woman may heaven reward my apostasy 
to blast my great happiness on earth 
and make all joy abortive 

revoke these hasty syllable they carry 
to great a penalty for breach of love 
to i I be not worth thy suffering 
you do not know what beauty may invite 
your change what happiness may tempt your eye 
and heart together 

shall all the grace of your sex conspire 
in one and she shall court i with a dower 
able to buy a kingdom when I give 
my heart from Polidora 

I suspect not 
and to requite thy constancy I swear 

it be sin to let thou waste thy breath 
I have assurance of thy noble thought 

my lord your uncle have be everywhere 
in the court inquire for you his look speak 
some earnest cause 

I be more acquaint with 
thy virtue then to imagine thou will not 
excuse i now one kiss dismiss he 
who heart shall wait on Polidora prithee 
let i not wish for thy return too often 
my father 

I meet Arcadius in strange haste he tell i 
he have be with thou

you come now from court how look the queen 
this golden morning 

like a bride her soul 
be all on mirth her eye have quicken fire 
able to strike a spring into the earth 
in winter 

then Lysimachus can haven 
no frost in his blood that live so near her beam 

his politic father the protector smile too 
resolve to see the ceremony of the queen 
it will be a day of state 

I be not well 

how not well retire then I must return 
my attendance be expect Polidora 
be careful of thy health

you amaze i sir 

dear nephew if thou respect thy safety 
my honour or my age remove thyself

i who be my enemy 

take horse and instant forsake the city 
or else within some unsuspected dwell 
obscure thyself stay not to know the reason 

sir I beseech your pardon which in the number 
of my offence unto any shall 
provoke this dishonourable flight 

I will when I petition for thy stay 
I have plead for thy banishment thou know not 
what threaten thou 

I will desire to know it 
I be in no conspiracy of treason 
have ravish no man mistress not so much 
as give the lie to any what shall mean 
your strange and violent fear I will not stir 
until you make i sensible I have lose 
my innocence 

I must not live to see 
thy body full of wound it be less sin 
to rip thy father marble and fetch from 
the reverend vault his ash and disperse they 
by some rude wind where none shall ever find 
the sacred dust it be his legacy 
the breath he mingle with his prayer to heaven 
I shall preserve Arcadius who fate 
he prophesy in death will need protection 
thou wot disturb his ghost and call it to 
affright my dream if thou refuse to obey i 

you more inflame i to inquire the cause 
of your distraction and you will arm i better 
than any coward flight by acquaint i 
who malice aim to kill i good sir tell i 

then prayer and tear assist i 

sir 

Arcadius 
thou be a rash young man witness the spirit 
of he that trust i so much I bleed 
till I prevent this mischief 

ha keep off 

what mean you sir 

we be your friend 

I know your face but 
be not secure I will not be betray 

you wrong our heart who true honour you 

they say I must be kill 

by who 

I know not nor will I part with life so tame 

we dare engage we in your quarrel hide 
your sword it may beget suspicion 
it be enough to question you 

I be confident 
pray pardon i come I despise all danger 
yet a dear friend of i my uncle tell i 
he will not see my body full of wound 

your uncle this be strange 

yes my honest uncle 
if my unlucky star have point i 
so dire a fate 

there be some strange mistake in it 

Arcadius the queen will speak with you 
you must make haste 

though to my death I fly 
upon her summons I give up my breath 
then willing if she command it from i 

this do a little trouble i 

I know not 
what to imagine something be the ground 
of this perplexity but I hope there be not 
any such danger as he apprehend 

we have already grant to Seleucus 
and they shall try their valour if Arcadius 
have spirit in he to accept the challenge 
our royal word be past 

this be strange 

madam my son know not what he ask 
and you be cruel to consent so soon 

wherein have I offend to be robe 
at once of all the wealth I have Arcadius 
be part of i 

Seleucus life and i 
be twist on one thread both stand or fall 
together have the service for my country 
deserve but this reward to be send weep 
to my eternal home be not enough 
when I be young to lose my blood in war 
but the poor remnant that be scarce warm 
and faint creep through my wither vein 
must be let out to make you sport 

how can 
we that shall this morn see the sacred oil 
fall on your virgin tress hope for any 
protection hereafter when this day 
you sacrifice the blood of they that pray for you 
Arcadius I prithee speak thyself 
it be for thou I plead 

Seleucus kneel 
and say thou haste repent thy rash suit 
if ere I see thou fight I be thus wound 
how will the least drop force from thy vein 
afflict my heart 

why that be good 
Arcadius speak to she hear he madam 

if you call back this honour you have do i 
I shall repent I live do not persuade i 
Seleucus thou be a noble enemy 
and I will love thy soul though I despair 
our body friendly conversation 
I will we be to tug upon some cliff 
or like two prodigy in the air our conflict 
may general be gaze at and our blood 
appease our grandsire ash 

I be undo 

madam my father say I have offend 
if so I beg your pardon but beseech you 
for your own glory call not back your word 

they be both mad 

no more we have resolve 
and since their courage be so noble flame 
this morning we will behold the champion 
within the list be not afraid their strife 
will stretch so far as death so soon as we 
be crown prepare yourselves Seleucus 

I have receive another life in this high favour 
and may lose what nature give i 

Arcadius to encourage thy young valour 
we give thou our father sword 
command it from our armoury Lysimachus 
to our coronation 

I will forfeit 
my head for a rebellion then suffer it 

I be circle with confusion I will do somewhat 
my brain and friend assist i 

but do you think they le fight indeed 

perhaps 
her majesty will see about or two 
and yet it be wondrous strange such spectacle 
be rare in the court and they be to skirmish naked 
before she than there may be some excuse 
there be some gimcrack in it the queen be wise 
above her year 

Macarius be perplex 

I can blame he but my lord Eubulus 
return they be both trouble alas good man 
but our duty be expect we forget 

I must resolve and yet thing be not ripe 
my brain upon the torture 

this may quit 
the hazard of his person who least drop 
of blood be worth more than our family 
my lord Eubulus I have think a way 
to stay the young man desperate proceed 
it be our cause they fight let we beseech 
the queen to grant we two the privilege 
of duel rather than expose their life 
to either fury it be pity they 
shall run upon so black a destiny 
we be both old and may be spare a pair 
of fruitless tree mossy and wither trunk 
that fill up too much room 

most willing 
and I will praise her charity to allow it 
I have not yet forget to use a sword 
let we lose no time by this act she will licence 
our soul to leave our body but a day 
perhaps a hour the soon they may live 
to do she better service and be friend 
when we be dead and yet I have no hope 
this will be grant curse upon our faction 

if she deny we 

what 

I will do somewhat 

there be something of the sudden strike upon 
my imagination that may secure we 

name it if no dishonour wait upon it 
to preserve they I will accept any danger 

there be no other way and yet my heart 
will be excuse but it be to save his life 

speak it Eubulus 

in your ear I shall 
it shall make a noise if you refuse it 

Hum though it stir my blood I will meet Arcadius 
if this preserve thou not I must unseal 
another mystery 

we owe to all your love and will deserve 
at least by our endeavour that none may 
this day repent their prayer my lord protector 

madam I have no 
such title now and be bless to lose 
that name so happy I be but trust 
with a glorious burden 

you have prove 
yourself our faithful counsellor and must still 
protect our grow state a kingdom sceptre 
weigh down a woman arm this crown sit heavy 
upon my brow already and we know 
there be something more than mettle in this wreath 
of shine glory but your faith and counsel 
that be familiar with mystery 
and depth of state have power to make we fit 
for such a bear in which both you shall 
do loyal service and reward your duty 

heaven preserve your highness 

but yet my lord and gentleman let none 
mistake i that because I urge your wisdom 
I shall grow careless and impose on you 
the manage of this great province no 
we will be active too and as we be 
in dignity above your person so 
the great portion of the difficulty 
we call to we you in your several place 
relieve we with your experience 
observe in your best direction 
all modesty and distance for although 
we be but young no action shall forfeit 
our royal privilege or encourage any 
too unreverent boldness as it will become 
our honour to consult ere we determine 
of the most necessary thing of state 
so we be sensible of a check 
but in a brow that saucy control 
our action presume on our year 
as few or frailty of our sex that head 
be not secure that dare our power or justice 

she have a brave spirit look how the protector 
grow pale already 

but I speak to you 
be perfect in obedience and may spare 
this theme yet it be no immaterial 
part of our character since I desire 
all shall take notice I have study 
the knowledge of myself by which I shall 
better distinguish of your worth and person 
in your relation to we 

this language 
be but a threaten to somebody 

but we miss some that use not to absent 
their duty from we where be Macarius 

retire to grieve your majesty have give 
consent Arcadius shall enter list 
today with young Seleucus 

we purpose enter gentleman 
they shall proceed what be he 

a gentleman belong to Seleucus that give notice 
he be prepare and wait your royal pleasure 

he be compose for action give notice 
to Arcadius and admit the challenger 
let other prince boast their gaudy tilt

how say Arcadius 

give i leave to think 
there be no harmony but in your voice 
and not a accent of your heavenly tongue 
but strike i into rapture I incline 
to think the tale of Orpheus no fable

and charm the forest soften hell hell itself 
with his command lute it be no miracle 
to what you work who very breath convey 
the hearer into heaven how at your lip

and when you fly to heaven and leave this world 
no long maintenance of goodness from you 
than poetry shall lose all use with we 
and be no more since nothing in your absence

your courage dare have stand a tempest for 
our love can you for this incline to leave 
what other prince shall in vain have sue for

my trust be now discharge 

and we rejoice 

but do not mock i gentleman 
may I be bold upon your word to say

the king

my triumph be my shame 

thy ear Lysimachus 

gentleman I owe 
unto your love as large acknowledgement 
as to my birth for this great honour and 
my study shall be equal to be think 
worthy of both 

thou be turn marble 

there will be the less charge for my monument 

this must not be fit fast young king 

your sister sir be go 

my sister shall have be my bride that name 
put i in mind of Polidora ha 
Lisander Philocles gentleman 
if you will have i think your heart allow i 
Thedosius son o quick snatch some wing 
express it in your haste to Polidora 
tell she what title be new drop from heaven 
to make her rich only create for i 
give she the ceremony of my queen 
with all the state that may become our bride 
attend she to this throne be you not there 
yet stay it be too much pride to send for she 
we will go ourself no honour be enough 
for Polidora to redeem our fault 
salute she gentle from i and upon 
your knee present she with this diadem 
it be our first gift tell she Demetrius follow 
to be her guest and give himself a servant 
to her chaste bosom bid she stretch her heart 
to meet i I be lose in joy and wonder 

where be the captain of the castle 

he will attend your honour present 

give he knowledge we expect he 

I shall my lord 

he be my creature fear not 
and shall run any course that we propose 

my lord I like the substance of your plot 
it be promise but matter of this consequence 
be not so easy perfect and it do 
concern our head to build upon secure 
principle though Seleucus I confess 
carry a high and dare spirit in he 
it be hard to thrust upon the state new settle 
any impostor and we know not yet 
whether he will undertake to play the prince 
or if he shall accept it with what cunning 
he can behave himself 

my lord affair 
of such a glorious nature be half finish 
when they begin with confidence 

admit 
he want no art nor courage it must rest 
upon the people to receive his title 
and with what danger their uncertain breath 
may flatter we Demetrius scarce warm 
in the king seat I may suspect 

that reason 
make for our part for if it be so probable 
that young Demetrius shall be live why 
may not we work they to believe Leonatus 
the elder son be by some trick preserve 
and now will claim his own there be two son 
who in their father life we suppose dead 
may not we find a circumstance to make 
this seem as clear as tother let the vulgar 
be once possess we will carry Epire from 
Demetrius and the world 

I can be please 
to see my son a king enter Polianus 
the captain be here 

I wait your lordship pleasure 

we come to visit your late prisoner 
I will not doubt but you entreat he fair 
he will deserve it for himself and you 
be fortunate in any occasion 
to have express your service 

sir the knowledge 
of my honourable lord his father will 
instruct i to behave myself with all 
respect become i to such a son 

these thing will least 
oblige you but how bear he his restraint 

as one who soul be above it 

patient 

with contempt rather of the great command 
which make he prisoner he will talk sometime 
so strange to himself 

he be here 

why be I bear to be a subject it be 
soon answer sure my father be no prince 
that be all the same ingredience use to make 
a man as active though not royal blood 
go to my composition and I 
be get with as good a will perhaps 
and my birth cost my mother as much sorrow 
as I have be bear a emperor 

while I look 
upon he something in his face present 
a king indeed 

he do resemble much 
Thedosius too 

who son we will pretend he 
this will advance our plot 

it be but a name 
and mere opinion that prefer one man 
above another I will imagine then 
I be a prince or some brave thing on earth 
and see what follow but it must not be 
my single voice will carry it the name 
of king must be attend with a troop 
of acclamation on who airy wing 
he mount and once exalt threaten heaven 
and all the star how to acquire this noise 
and be the thing I talk of man have rise 
from a more cheap nobility to empire 
from dark original and sordid blood 
nay some that have no father son of the earth 
and fly people have aspire to kingdom 
make nation tremble any have practise frown 
to awe the world their memory be glorious 
and I will hug they in their shade but what be 
all this to i that be I know not what 
and less in expectation 

be you serious 

will you assist and run a fate with we 

command my life I owe it to your favour 

Arcadius be once as far from be 
as I and have we not so cunning 
be reconcile or one or both have go 
to seek our fortune in another world 
what be the device now if my death be next 
the summons shall not make i once look pale 

chide your too vain suspicion we bring 
a life and liberty with what else can make 
thy ambition happy thou have a glorious flame 
we come to advance it 

how 

have but a will 
and be what thy own thought dare prompt thou to 
a king 

you do not mock i gentleman 
you be my father sir 

this minute shall 
declare it my Seleucus our heart swell 
with joy with duty rather o my boy 

what be the mystery 

you must be a king 

Seleucus stay thou be too incredulous 
let not our faith and study to exalt thou 
be so reward 

I pronounce thou king 
unless thy spirit be turn coward and 
thou faint to accept it 

king of what 

of Epire 

although the queen since she send i hither 
be go to heaven I know not how 
that title can devolve to i 

we have 
no queen since he that shall have marry she 
be prove her young brother and now king 
in his own title 

thank you gentleman 
there be hope for i 

why you dare fight with he 
and need be for the kingdom 

with Arcadius 
if you will make stake my life against his crown 
I will fight with he and you and your fine son 
and all the courtier one after another 

it will come to that 

I be of your lordship mind so fare you well 

yet stay and hear 

what that you have betray i 
do tell your king my life be grow a burden 
and I will confess and make your soul look pale 
to see how nimble i shall leap this battlement 
of flesh and die laugh at your poor malice 

no more long live Leonatus king of Epire 

Leonatus who be that 

be bold and be a king our brain have be 
work to raise you to this height here be 
none but friend dare you but call yourself 
Leonatus and but justify with confidence 
what we will proclaim you if we do not bring 
the crown to your head we will forfeit we 

the state be in distraction Arcadius 
be prove a king there be a elder brother 
if you dare but pronounce you be the same 
forget you be my son 

these be no trifle sir all be plot 
to assure your greatness if you will be wise 
and take the fair occasion that be present 

Arcadius you say be lawful king 
and now to depose he you will make i 
a elder brother be it not so 

most right 

nay right or wrong if this be your true meaning 

upon our life 

I will venture my but with your pardon 
who brain be this from who take this plot life 

my lord Cassander 

and you be of his mind and you and think 
this may be do 

the destiny shall not cross we if you have 
spirit to undertake it

i what you promise you shall both divide 
i equal one word my lord I have rather

to advance his politic end 

have no suspicion 

So so I see Demetrius heel already 
trip up and I will dispatch he out of the way 
which go I can depose this at my leisure 
be a impostor than my son stand fair 
and may piece with the princess we lose time 
what think you if we first surprise the court 
while you command the castle we shall curb 
all opposition 

let we proclaim he first 
I have some faction the people love i 
they gain to we we will fall upon the court 

unless Demetrius yield himself he bleed 

who dare call treason sin when it succeed 

madam you be too passionate and lose 
the greatness of your soul with the expense 
of too much grief for that which providence 
have ease you of the burden of a state 
above your tender bear 

thou be a fool 
and can not reach the spirit of a lady 
bear great as I be and make only less 
by a too cruel destiny above 
our tender bear what go rich to 
the composition of man than we 
our soul as free and spacious our heart be 
as great our will as large each thought as active 
and in this only man more proud than we 
that will have we less capable of empire 
but search the story and the name of queen 
shine bright with glory and some precedent 
above man imitation 

I grant it 
for the honour of our sex nor have you madam 
by any weakness forfeit command 
he that succeed in justice be before you 
and you have gain more in a royal brother 
than you can lose by your resign of Epire

wound in i above cure

something to fright yourself which can
