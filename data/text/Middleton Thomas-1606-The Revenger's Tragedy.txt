against yond silver ceiling 

prithee tell i 
why may not I partake with you you vow once 
to give i share to every tragic thought 

by the mass I think I do too 
then I will divide it to thou the old duke 
think my outward shape and inward heart 
be cut out of one piece for he that prate his secret 
his heart stand of the out side hire i by price 
to greet he with a lady 
in some fit place veil from the eye of the court 
some darken blushless angle that be guilty 
of his forefather lust and greatfolk riot 
to which I easy to maintain my shape 
consent and do wish his impudent grace 
to meet she here in this unsunnedlodge 
wherein it be night at noon and here the rather 
because unto the torture of his soul 
the bastard and the duchess have appoint 
their meeting too in this luxurious circle 
which most afflict sight will kill his eye 
before we kill the rest of he 

it will i'faith most dreadful digest 
I see not how you can have miss i brother 

true but the violence of my joy forget it 

ay but where be that lady now 

o at that word 
I be lose again you can find i yet 
I be in a throng of happy apprehension 
he be suit for a lady I have take care 
for a delicious lip a sparkle eye 
you shall be witness brother 
be ready stand with your hat off 

troth I wonder what lady it shall be 
yet it be no wonder now I think again 
to have a lady stoop to a duke that stoop unto his man 
it be common to be common through the world 
and there be more private common shadow vice 
than those who be know both by their name and price 
it be part of my allegiance to stand bare 
to the duke concubine and here she come 

Madame his grace will not be absent long 
Secret never doubt we madam it will be worth 
three velvet gown to your ladyship know 
Few lady respect that disgrace a poor thin shell 
it be the best grace you have to do it well 
I will save your hand that labour I will unmask you 

why brother brother 

be thou beguile now tut a lady can 
at such all hide beguile a wise man 
have I not fit the old surfeiter 
with a quaint piece of beauty age and bare bone 
be ere ally in action here be a eye 
able to tempt a greatman to serve God 
a pretty hang lip that have for get now to dissemble 
methinks this mouth shall make a swearer tremble 
a drunkard clasp his tooth and not undo they 
to suffer wet damnation to run through they 
here be a cheek keep her colour let the wind go whistle 
spout rain we fear thou not be hot or cold 
all be one with we and be not he absurd 
who fortune be upon their face set 
that fear no other god but wind and wet 

brother you have speak that right 
be this the form that live shine so bright 

the very same 
and now methinks I can even chide myself 
for dote on her beauty though her death 
shall be revenge after no common action 
do the silkworm expend her yellow labour 
for thou for thou do she undo herself 
be lordship sell to maintain ladyship 
for the poor benefit of a bewitch minute 
why do yond fellow falsify highway 
and put his life between the judge lip 
to refine such a thing keep horse and man 
to beat their valour for she 
Surely we be all mad people and they 
who we think be be not we mistake those 
it be we be mad in scence they but in clothes 

faith and in clothes too we give we our due 

do every proud and selfaffecting dame 
camphire her face for this and grieve her maker 
in sinful bath of milk when many a infant starve 
for her superfluous outside all for this 
who now bid twenty pound a night prepare 
music perfume and sweetmeat all be hush

to have thou see at revel forgetful feast 
and unclean brothel sure it will fright the sinner 
and make he a good coward put a reveller 
out off his antic amble 
and cloy a epicure with empty dish 
here may a scornful and ambitious woman 
look through and through herself see lady with false form 
you deceive man but can deceive worm 
now to my tragic business look you brother 
I have not fashion this only for show 
and useless property no it shall bear a part 
even in it own revenge this very skull 
who mistress the duke poison with this drug

and string myself with heavy sound wire 
like such a instrument that speak merry thing sad 

then it be as I mean 
I give you out at first in discontent

tell i what have make thou so melancholy 

why go to law 

why will that make a man melancholy 

yes to look long upon ink and black buckram I go i to law in anno quadragesimo secundo and I wade out of it in anno sextagesimo tertio 

what three and twenty year in law 

I have know those that have be five and fifty and all about pullen and pig 

may it be possible such man shall breathe 
to vex the term so much 

it be food to some my lord there be old man at the present that be so poison with the affectation of lawword have have many suit canvas that their common talk be nothing but Barbary latin they can so much as pray but in law that their sin may be remove with a writ of error and their soul fetch up to heaven with a sasarara 

it seem most strange to i 
yet all the world meet round in the same bend 
where the heart set there go the tongue consent 
how do apply thy study fellow 

study why to think how a great rich man lie a die and a poor cobbler toll the bell for he how he can depart the world and see the great cheststand before he when he lie speechless how he will point you ready to all the box and when he be past all memory as the gossip guess then think he of forfeiture and obligation nay when to all man hear he whirl and rattle in the throat he be busy threaten his poor tenant and this will last i now some seven year think or thereabouts but I have a conceit a come in picture upon this I draw it myself which i'faith la I will present to your honour you shall not choose but like it for your lordship shall give i nothing for it 

nay you mistake i then 
for I be publish bountiful enough 
let we taste of your conceit

have pare he to the quick 

the conceit be pretty i'faith 
but take it upon my life it will never be like 

no why I be sure the whore will be like well enough 

i if she be out of the picture heed like she then himself 

and as for the son and heir he shall be a eyesore to no young reveler for he shall be draw in cloth of gold breech 

and thou have put my meaning in the pock 
and can not draw that out my thought be this et 
to see the picture of a usure father 
boil in hell our richman will never like it 

o true I cry you hearty mercy I know the reason for some of they have rather be damn indeed than damn in colour 

a perilous melancholy have wit enough 
to murder any man and I will give he mean 
I think thou be ill money 

money ho ho 
it have be my want so long it be now my scoff 
I have even forget what colour silver be off 

it hit as I can wish 

I get good clothes 
of those that dread my humour and for tableroom 
I feed on those that can be rid of i 

somewhat to set thou up withal 

o my eye 

how now man 

almost strike blind 
this bright unusual shine to i seem proud 
I dare not look till the sun be in a cloud 

I think I shall affect his melancholy 
how be they now 

the better for your ask 

you shall be better yet if you but fasten 
true on my intent now you be both present 
I will unbrace such a close private villain 
unto your vengeful sword the like never hear of 
who have disgrace you much and injure we 

disgrace we my lord 

i Hippolito 
I keep it here till now that both your anger 
may meet he at once 

I be covetous 
to know the villain 

you know he that slave Pandarus 
Piato who we threaten last 
with iron in perpetual prisonment 

all this be I 

be it he my lord 

I will tell you you first prefer he to i 

do you brother 

I do indeed 

and the ungrateful villain 
to quit that kindness strong wrought with i 
be as you see a likely man for pleasure 
with jewel to corrupt your virgin sister 

o villain 

he shall sure die that do it 

I far from think any virgin harm 
especial know she to be as chaste 
as that part which scarce suffer to be touch 
the eye will not endure he 

will you not my lord 
it be wondrous honourable do 

but with some five frown keep he out 

out slave 

what do i he but in revenge of that 
go of his own free will to make infirm 
your sister honour who I honour with my soul 
for chaste respect and not prevail there 
as it be but desperate folly to attempt it 
in mere spleen by the way way lay your mother 
who honour be a coward as it seem 
yield by little force 

coward indeed 

he proud of their advantage as he think 
bring i these news for happy but I heaven forgive i for it 

what do your honour 

in rage push he from i 
trample beneath his throat spurn he and bruise 
indeed I be too cruel to say troth 

most noble manage 

have not heaven a ear be all the lightning waste 

if I now be so impatient in a modest cause 
what shall you be 

full mad he shall not live 
to see the moon change 

he be about the palace 
Hippolito entice he this way that thy brother 
may take full mark of he 

heart that shall not need my lord 
I can direct he so far 

yet for my hate sake 
go wind he this way I will see he bleed myself 

what now brother 

nay even what you will you be put to it brother 

a impossible task I will swear 
to bring he hither that be already here 

thy name I have forget it 

vindice my lord 

it be a good name that 

ay a revenger 

it do betoken courage thou shall be valiant 
and kill thy enemy 

that be my hope my lord 

this slave be one 

I will doom he 

then I will praise thou 
do thou observe i best and I will best raise thou 

Indeed I thank you 

now Hippolito where be the slave Pandarus 

your good lordship 
will have a loathsome sight of he much offensive 
he be not in case now to be see my lord 
the worst of all the deadly sin be in he 
that beggarly damnation drunkenness 

then he be a doubleslave 

it be well convey upon a sudden wit 

what be you both 
firm resolve I will see he dead myself 

or else let not we live 

you may direct your brother to take note of he 

I shall 

rise but in this and you shall never fall 

your honour vassal 

this be wise carry 
deep policy in we make fool of such 
then must a slave die when he know too much 

o thou almighty patience it be my wonder 
that such a fellow impudent and wicked 
shall not be cleave as he stand 
or with a secret wind burst open 
be there no thunder leave or be it keep up 
in stock for heavy vengeance there it go 

brother we lose ourselves 

but I have find it 
it will hold it be sure thanks thanks to any spirit 
that mingle it among my invention 

what be it 

it be sound and good thou shall partake it 
I be hire to kill myself 

true 

prithee mark it 
and the old duke be dead but not convey 
for he be already miss too and you know 
murder will peep out of the close husk 

most true 

what say you then to this device 
if we dress up the body of the duke 

in that disguise of you 

you be quick you have reach it 

I like it wondrous 

And be in drink as you have publish he 
to lean he on his elbow as if sleep have catch he 
which claim most interest in such sluggy man 

good yet but here be a doubt 
methinks by the duke son to kill that pandar 
shall when he be know be think to kill the duke 

neither oh thanks it be substantial 
for that disguise be on he which I wear 
it will be think I which he call the pandar do kill the duke and flee away in his apparel leave he so disguise to avoid swift pursuit 

firm and firm 

nay doubt not it be in grain I warrant it hold colour 

let we about it 

but by the way too now I think on it brother 
let we conjure that base devil out of our mother
