




THere's Musick in this sound, Life, Soul, and Charm.
What Breast so frozen, but this sport can warm?
Deserted Woods, and unfrequented Plains,
And you, your Countreys shame, poor frighted Swayns,
I am your Champion; 'tis by Me decreed,
The long disturber of your Peace shall bleed.
This Savage Bore must Dye.







"Had I thy fresh and blooming Cheek, adieu
"I'de say to Beasts, and nobler Game pursue.





A Game more noble? what more Sacred task,
Could Fortune grant, or his Ambition ask,
Who for his Country does with Monsters fight,
And the VVo•… Terrour makes his dear delight?





This Savage Chace leave t'an Ignobler hand:
A fairer Prize does your pursuit demand.
For which 
No less does the Arcadian safety call,
Then for this Erymanthian Monsters fall.
Have not our Oracles long since design'd
From Silvios Nuptials, we our Peace should find?


"To have a Nymph so fair, that not a Swain
"So proud, but sighs for her, and sighs in vain:
"To have this matchless bright Divinity
"By Destiny and Gods reserved for Thee;
"Nay thrown into thy Arms without one sigh or tear;
"And thou (unworthy) not to value her?





Love, the dull Fetter of all slavish souls;
No such weak power my free-born mind controuls.





"Oh Silvio, hadst thou tryed Love once, & found
"In Mutual Lovers, what true Joys abound,
"I know thou'dst say, Oh Love, the sweetest Guest,
"Why hast thou been a stranger to this Breast?
"Leave, leave the Woods; leave following Beasts, fond Boy,
"And follow Love.





Love, an unmanly Joy!
"Keep they those Pleasures to themselves alone
"Who find a Soul in 'em, for I find none.





No Soul in Love, the Worlds great Soul! Dull Youth
"Too soon (beleiv't) thou'lt find this pow'rful Truth;
"Perchance too late; for he'l be sure, before
"We dye, to make us all once feel his pow'r.
"And be assur'd, worse torment none can prove,
"Than in old Limbs, the Youthful Itch of Love.
"Old Men
"In Love are doubly wrackt, both with the sense
"Of their Youths Pride, and Ages Impotence.





Must then my Youth for glorious actions lent,
Be on dull Woman, prodigally spent?
"For those Chimeras in a Lovers head,
"Those strange Elysiums by Mens Feavours bred?





"Tell me, if in this pleasing month of May,

"When Earth is drest in all her rich array,
"Instead of bladed Fields, Brooks uncontrol'd,
"Green Woods, and painted Meads, thou should'st behold,
"Bald Fields and Meads, Brooks bound with Ice; the Pine,
"The Beech, the Ash, the Oak, the Elme, the Vine,

  3"And Poplar-like inverted Sceletons
"Stand desolate, ratling their naked bones:
"Wouldst thou not say, Nature is out of Tune,
"The World is sick, and like to dye in June?

Now turn thy Eyes into thy self, and see
How ill thy Passions, with thy Youth, agree:
"Behold a much more monstrous Novelty
"Then this would seem in Nature. Courteous Heaven
"To every Age has proper humours given.
"And as in Old Men, Love absurdly shews;
"So Young Men, Enemies to Love, oppose
"Nature and Heaven. Look Silvio round about,
"Examine this whole Universe throughout;
"All that is fair or good, here or above,
"Is either Lover, or the work of Love.





How canst thou with such trecherous Arts perswade:
And thus the freedom of my Soul invade?
"Was it for this I had my tender years
"Committed to the care of thy grey hairs?
"That thou shouldst thus Effemin•…te my heart
"With Love? Know'st who I am, or who thou ar•…?





"Thou art a Man, or should'st be one, and I
"Another; what I teach Humanity.
"And if thou scornest that name, which is thy Pride,
"Take heed, instead of being Deified,
"Thou turn not Beast.






"From whom my lofty Pedigree I bring,
"Had never been thus Valiant, nor thus Famed,
"If first the Monster Love he had not tamed,
And his great deeds by Glorys Standart framed.





See foolish Youth, how weak thy Reasons prove;
"Had great Alcides never been in Love,
"How then had'st thou been born? If he o're▪came
"Monsters and Men, to Love impute his Fame;
"To Love his Conquests. Souls like his untamed,
"In their own Nature rough, when once inflamed
"With generous Love, and with its Sweets allayd,
"Are clearer, apter for great actions made.

  4"If thou•…t Ambitious then to imitate
"Great Hercules, and not degenerate
"From thy high blood▪ since Woods thou dost affect,
"Follow the Woods, but do not Love neglect.
Not that I'de have thee thy mean thoughts debase
To poor Dorindas Love of low-born race.
Thy Amaryllis is of race Divine;
Besides by Contract, she's already thine.
Thy Wife already.

















Can Silvio forget his Vow?
Your mutual promi•…es received, and given?
"Take heed, bold Youth, how you dare sport with Heav'n.





"Mans freedom is Heav'ns gift, which does not take
"Us at our words, when a forc'd Vow we make.





"I; but (unless our Hopes and Judgments fail)
"Heav'n made this Match, and promis'd to Entayl
"A thousand blessings on't.





"'Tis like that there
"Is nothing else to do. A proper care
"To vex the calm rest of the Gods above.

Lynco, I scorn both Lovers Oaths, and Love.






"Thou sprung from Heav'n, harsh Boy? nor of Divine
"Can I say suppose thee, nor of humane line.
"Alectoes Poyson thy cold Limbs did fashion;
"Fair Venus had no hand in thy Creation.










"Fair Amaryllis, if by speaking, I
"Offend thee, I will hold my peace, and dye.





"Mirtillo, Love is a great pain at best;
"But so much more, the more it is supprest.
Why do you inward burn, and find no tongue?






"My fear, and my respect to her, thus long,
"Have silenc'd me. Alas, too well I know,
"Nor has Love struck me blind, that in my low
"And slender Fortunes, it were idle pride
"To hope a Nymph so shaped, so qualified,
"So rais'd in Birth, in Spirit, and in Blood,
"Above all these so gentle, and so good,
"Can e're be mine. No; I have took the height
"Of my unhappy Star, and dread my Fate.
But Amaryllis Weds; say, does she not?









Oh my u•…happy Lot!
Now Destiny has done its cruellest part,
Despair till now, but hover'd round my heart.
Till now, amid'st the greatest of my fear,
Some glimmering hope at distance did appear:
My wishing Love did the kind Flatterer play;
And though 'twas Night, me-thoughts I dreamt of Day.
But now my Horrour runs through all my Veins:
Despair fills up my heart, and absolute Tyrant reigns.
Past all recovery she's gone, she's gone.
I see the Prize by a blest Favourite won;
From my weak arms for ever, ever, torne;
I see the Mirtle Wreath my Rivals brows adorn.
And now Ergasto, e're my heart quite break,
"Though 'tis too late, I am resolv'd I'le speak.





"Woe be to her, should her stern Father hear.
"That to stoln prayers she ever lent an Ear.





Alas my Looks and Language shall be far,
Both from offending him, and injuring her.
"I'le only say to her I owe my Death,
"And beg, when I sigh out my latest breath,
"She'd cast her fair Eyes on me, and say, Dye;
"This favourable Boon she can't deny:
That e're she goes to make another Blest,
My Sighs may reach her Ear, though not her Breast.
"Silvio, the Rich, the Gallant, and the Fair,
"The Priest, Montanoes only Son and Heir;

  6"'Tis he (oh envied Youth) whose joy appears
"So ripe for Harvest in his Spring of years.





"Indeed you've little cause to envy him;
Rather to pitty him.






Can pitty such a happy State befit?




"Because he Loves her not.




"And has he Wit?
"Has he a heart? Is he not blind? And yet
"When I consider with what full Aspect
"Her Starry Eyes their influence direct
"Into my Breast, she cannot have a Dart
"Left in her Quiver for another heart.
"But why do they a Jem so precious throw,
"To one that knows it not, and scorns it so?





Because from Silvios Marriage, Heav'n of old,
T'Arcadia has deliverance fore-told:
You, though a Stranger here, have understood,
That of an offer'd Virgins guiltless blood,
A Tribute by Dianas dire command
Is yearly paid by this unhappy Land.





"But what strange Crime deserved so sharp a Doom?
"How could such monstrous cruelty find room
"In a Celestial mind?





The cause of all
This storm, was one of Cynthias Favourites fall:
Her best-lov'd Priest, a Youth of Noble blood,
By an inconstant Nymphs fair Eyes subdu'd;
And by her Vows and broken Oaths betray'd,
In desperation sor this Perjur'd Maid,
Himself, before her Feet, a bloody Victim laid.
Whose Death Diana did so much incense,
That by a long and violent Pestilence,
A suffering Nation in her fall was crusht:
In Purple dye her killing fury blusht:
Nor could the dying Criminals blood alone,
Wash off her stain, and for her sins atone.




But how did you at last the Goddess rage appease?




Our Cure's almost as ill, as our Disease.

  7"For going to consult Heav'ns Will, we from
"The Oracle received this fatal Doom,
"That yearly, we to Nights offended Queen;

"A Maid or Wife should offer, past fi•…teen,

"And under twenty; by which means, the rage
"That •…wallow'd thousands, one death should asswage.





And was this Barbrous Tribute by her will,
Doom'd to be paid for ever?






"Being askt agen, what end our Woe should have;
"To our demand, this punctual answer gave.
"Your Woe shall end, when two of Race Divine▪



"And for a faithless Nymphs Apostate State,

"A faithful Shepherd supererrogate.

"Now there is left in all Arcadia,

"Of Heav'nly stock, no other branch but they.
"Young Silvio, and fair Amarillis, She
"From Pan descended, from Alcides, He;
"And to our grief, till now, there never yet
"Of Heav'nly Race, a Male and Female met.
On this a Nations hope depends; the rest
"Is still reserv'd in Fates own secret breast;
"And with this Marriage, one day will ensue.





"And all this poor Mirtillo to undo.
"What a long reach is here? what Armys Band
"Against one heart, half murder'd to their hand?
"Is't not enough that cruel Love's my Foe,
"Unless Fate too contrives my over-throw.





"Alas Mirtillo, grieving does no good;
"Tears quench not Love, but are its Milk and Food.
"▪T shall scape me hard, but e're the Sun descend,
"This Cruel One shall hear thee: Courage Friend.





That word has shot life through me; do but this,
And to repay you for so vast a Bliss,
When I am Dead, and her fair Hand has given
The killing-wound, I'le send you thanks from Heav'n.











Yonder he goes; oh that bewitching Face;
"When I behold Mirtilloes every grace,
"His unaffected Carriage, all his Charms;
What pleasing heat my panting Bosom warms?
But when I think anothers Chains he wears,
And will be deaf to all my Sighs and Pray'rs,
That dismal thought my bleeding heart-strings tears.
"Shall I the flame of thousand hearts, the wrack
"Of thousand Souls, languish and burn, and lack
"That pitty I denyed to others? I
Who kill by Cruelty, by fondness dye.





Talk not of dying, Death's an end of pain
To those that Love but once, and never Love again:
But thanks to Heav'n, you've no such danger nigh,
You have that pleasing Charm, Variety;
Let those that starve in Love, complain they dye.





Yes Girl, had I no other Love but this,
In Love there would be very little Bliss.
"How extream poor must that ill House-VVise prove,
"Who in all the World keeps but one only Love.
"What's Faith?
"What's Constancy? Tales which the Jealous feign,
"To awe fond Girls; 〈◊〉 as absurd as vain?
"Faith in a Woman (if at least there be
"Faith in a Woman unreveal'd to me,)
"Is not a Virtue, nor a Heav'nly Grace,
"But the sad Penance of a ruind Face,
"That's pleas'd with one, 'cause it can please no more.
A thousand fetter'd Slaves, should all besore
A Beauteous Face fall prostrate, and adore.
"What's Beauty, tell me,
"If not pursued? where Lovers numerous are,
"It is a sign the pe•…son Lov'd is rare;
A Crea•…ure Charming, excellently fair.






You Beauties then like Majesty in State,
"Keep a large Train. One Officer to wait,
"Another to p•…esent, a third to p•…ate,
"A fourth for somewhat else.





Well Celia, when thy opening Beauty blows,
Grown up to Love, take my advice, and use
"Thy Lovers, like thy Garments, put on one;
"Have many; often shift, and wear out none.
"For daily Conversation breeds distast;
"Distast Contempt, and Loathing at the last.
"Then get the start, let not the Servant say,
"He has turn'd his Mrs, but she him away.
"These are the rules I take; I've choyce, and strive
"To please 'em all; to this, my hand I give,
"And wink on him; the handsom'st I admit
"Into my Bosom; but not one shall get
"Into my Heart; and yet I know not how]
"(Ay me) Mirtillo's crept too near it now.





For shame, leave sighing Sister, have more Pride▪
You that have got so many Loves beside,
Cure this fond Thirst by some more pleasing tast;
In half your plenty, none but Fools would fast.





I never sigh'd, but to deceive before,
Such pains as these, till now, I never bore:
What shall I do?
Leave him, I cant; Court him I must not. Yes:
Love forbids that, and Honour hinders this.
"First then I'le try Allurements, and discover
"The Love to him, but will conceal the Lover.
If after this, he does my flame despise,
Nought but Revenge, shall my hot Rage suffice,
And my Proud Rival Amaryllis Dyes.
My Persecu•…or here 










Confusion seize her! how she hasts away?
Why by Heav'ns Curse and Malice was I Born

  10To be a Vassal to such Pride and Scorn?
"As Frosts to Plants, to ripend Ears a Storm;
"To Flowers the Mid-day-Sun, to Seed the Worm;
"To Stags the Toyles, to Birds the Lime-twiggs, so
"Is Love to man an everlasting Foe.
"And he that call'd it fire, pierced well into
"Its Treacherous Nature; for if fire you view,
"How bright and beautiful it is. Approacht,
"How warm and comfortable? but when toucht,
"Oh how it burns; the Monster-bearing Earth
"Did never Teem such a Prodigious Birth.
"Where e're Love fixes its Imperial Seat,
"Cottage and Pallace to its Rage submit.
So absolute is its too large Command,
Nothing can its Tyrannick pow'r withstand.
"So Love, if you behold it in a pair
"Of Starry-eyes, in a bright tress of hair;
"How temptingly it looks; what kindly flames
"It breaths? what Peace, what Pardons it proclaims▪
"But if thou dost it in thy bosom keep,
"So that it gather strength, and can but creep,
"No Tygress in Hircanian Mountains Nurst,
"No Lybian-Lyoness is half so curst.
"Nor •…rozen Snake •…osterd with humane breath,
"His Flames are hot as Hell, Bonds strong as Death.




Why all this storm? leave her, and rage no more.




Preach silence to the Winds; I'le ne're give o're.
"Women, perfidious Women; all that's naught,
"In Love, from You is by In•…ection caught.
"He of himself is good, meek as the Dove,
"That draws the Chariot of the Queen of Love.
"But you have made him wild 
"You, who your Care, your Pride, and Pleasure place
"In the meer out-fide of a Wanton face.
"Nor is't your business how to pay true Love,
"And •…tudy whether shall more constant prove.
"To bind two •…ls in one, and of one heart,
"To make the other but the Counter-part.

  11But how to use those arts you should abhor;
"To paint your faded Cheeks, to cover o're
"The faults of Time and Nature. How ye make
"Pale Feulemort a pure Vermillion take;
"Fill up the wrinckles; dye black, white; a spot
"With a spot hide, where 'tis; make't where 'tis not.
"And all the while such Torment you are in,
"That 'tis at once a Penance and a Sin.





But for Coriscas Crimes, why must you strike
At the whole Sex?




Damne 'em, they're all alike.



But why such rayling?




Rayling do you call't!
There's not that Accusation, nor that Guilt,
As barbarous as Hell could e're invent;
Of which Perfidious Woman's innocent.
"Do their lips open? E're they speak, they lye;
"And if they sigh, they lye most damnably.
"False lights their Eyes are, and false weights their Ears;
"Their Hearts false measures, and false Pearl their Tears.
"So talk, or look, or think, or laugh, or cry;
"Seem, or Seem not; walk, sit, or stand, they lye.





If Women are such Monsters as you make,
How have they Charms, mens hearts how can they take?





Their Snare's so plain, you'd wonder we are caught:
But Love is man's misfortune, not his fault.
For to promote their curst bewitching Arts,
They steal our Reasons first, and then our Hearts.
And th' acts of Mad men can't be call'd their sin,
And none but Mad-men ever take Love in.
Yes, Mad indeed, when we repose our trust
"In those who would dye, rather than be just.
"These are the cursed Arts, these are the ways
"That have made Love so hateful in our days.
"False and ungrateful Nymph. Example take
"By me, unskilful Lovers, how ye make
"An Idol of a Face; and tak't for granted,
"There's no such Devil as a Woman Sainted.

  12"She thinks her Wit and Beauty without peer,
"And o're thy slavish Soul does domineer,
"Like some grear Goddess, counting thou wert born
"As a thing Mortal only for her •…corn.
"Takes all that praise as Tribute of her merit,
"Which is the flattery of thy abject spirit.





Why then so humbly is that Sex adored?
And each kind Look with sighs and tears implor'd?
"These are the Womans Arms: Take the best way,
Pursue, and tire, and seize her as your prey.





Thou hast inspir'd my so ul, and I'le obey.
Since Tears and Prayers are vain, a bolder course
I'le steer: I am resolved t'enjoy by force:
"I must strike fire out of her Breast, by dint
"Of Steel; what Fool used Bellows to a Flint?
"Corisca, thou shalt find no more of me
"That bashful Lover: No; I'le let her see
"That Love sometimes (though he appear sta•… blind)
"Can from his Eyes the Handkercher unbind.
And when I once have got her in my Arms,
Ile sport and revel in her Riffled Charms.










HOw is it possible my Daughter shou'd
"By Heav'ns be destined for the general go•…d?
"For when I mark the words o'th'Oracle,
"Me-thinks with those the Signes agree not well.
"If Love must joyn 'em, and the one does flye,
"How can that be? How can the strings which tye
"The True-Loves-Knot be hatred and disdain?
Did Heav'n intend this Marriage, '•…would ordain,
Beauty, not Hounds o're Sylvios heart should reign.





"He's young; and has time yet to •…eel Loves Dart.



He Love! The Woods have took up all his heart.



Not so, but Love may still new pleasures bring.




"But Love's a Blossom that adorns our Spring.
Since want of Love is that this age his Crime,
I have but little hope t'expect from Time.





"What if this Marriage be not writ in Heav'n,
"'Tis made on Earth, their mutual Vows they've given.
"To violate which, were rashly to profane
"The God-head of great Cynthia, in whose Fane
"The Solemne Oath was taken. Now how prone
"Our Goddess is to anger, and how soon
"By us to be incenst, thou'rt not to learn;
But I declare as far as I discern:
"And a Priests mind rapt up above the sky,
"Can into the eternal Counsels pry:
"This Knot is tyed by the hand of Destiny.
"Besides, I in a Dream have something viewd,
"Which my old hopes has more than e're renew'd.





Dreams, what are they? Your hope's too strongly bent;
But say, what did the Airy form present?





"When swelling Ladon weary of his Yoke,
"The Banks with his Rebellious waters broke:
"So that where Birds but lately built their Nests,
"Usurping Fishes swam; and Men and Beasts
"With Flocks and Woods promiscuously ta'n,
"Th'Impartial Deluge swept into the Main.
"That very night, that very night undone,
"I lost a Child, and then my only Son:
Whilst in his Cradle the poor Infant lay,
"The cruel Torrent ravisht him away:
I owe my Death to that unhappy day.





"And I may say of thy two Sons; the Floods
"Have rav•…sht one, the other's lost i'th' Woods.





Perhaps kind Heav'n in the surviving Brother,
"Will by the one make me amends for t'other.
"'Tis always good to hope; now hear me out:
"'T was at the dawning of the Morn, about

  14"That Mungrel hour, which gotten betwixt Night
"And day, is half an Aethiop, and half White:
When kind Heav'n to my waking fancy brought
These l•…vely Images of Fate, me thought
"On famed Alpheos▪ banks I Angling sate
"under a shady Beech; there came up straight
"A grave old Man, down to the middle bare;
"His Chin all dropping, and his grizled hair,
And said, Loe, here's thy Son, and take good heed


Thou kill him not, then dived into the Reed:
Startled, I cry'd, Propitious Heav'n defend:
No sooner did the Reverend shape descend,
"But strait black Clouds obscured the Heav•…n around,
"And threatning me with a dire Tempest fround;
"I to my bosom clapt the Babe for fear,
"And cryed, shall then one hour both give and bear
"Away my hopes: Streight all the ayr was turn'd
"Serene, and Thunder▪ bolts to ashes burn'd,
"Fell hissing in the water; with Bows broken,
"And Shafts by thousands; Signs which did betoken
"Extinguisht Vengeance; then a shrill Voice broke
"From the riv'd Beech, which in its tongue thus spoke;
"Believe Montano, and thy hopes still nourish,

"Thy fair Arcadia once agen shall flourish.






Can your fond hope from such weak fancies rise?
"Alas, Montano Dreams are Histories
"Of what is past, rather than Prophecies
"Of what's to come; mere sragments of the sight,
"Or thoughts of the past day reviv'd at night.
Man's Doom, and the great Oracles of Heav'n
Are never by such feeble voyces given.
"In short, how Heav'n has destined to dispose
"Of our two Children, neither of us knows.
"But this is clear to both of us; thine flyes,
"And against Natures Laws does Love despise.





"Take courage Titiro, do not debase
"Your thoughts with mortal fears, but nobly place

  15"Your hopes above: Heav'n favours a strong Faith,
"And a faint Prayer ne're climbs that Arduous Path.
"Our Childrens Pedegree you know's Divine,
"And Heav'n that smiles on all, will surely sh•…ne
"On its own Progeny. Come Titiro,

"Together to the Temple let us go.
And humbly bow to the Eternal Throne,
Victims and Prayers have pow'r, if Dreams have none.
"And thou high mover of the O•…bs, that ridest
"The Starry Region, with thy Wisdom guidest
"Their Course, look down upon our tottering state,
"And reconcile Disdain and Love with Fate?










"Riches, what are they, but our freedoms snares.
"What boots it in the Spring-time of ones years,
"To have the Attributes of fair and good,
"In mortall Veins to lock Celestial blood?
"If with all these our hearts Cont•…ment lose,
And what we most desire, want pow'r to choose?
"Happy that Shepherdess, whom •…ome course stuff

"Rich only in her self, and in the best
"And noblest Ornaments of Nature drest.
Whose narrow state no forreign Cares distress:
Her Bosom, and her little World at peace.
"Who in sweet Poverty no want does know,
"Nor the Distractions, which from Riches grow.
"Yet whatsoever may suffice the mind,
"In that Estate abundantly does-find.
"One Fountain is her Looking-glass, her Drink,

"And Shield is that she's Poor, Poor; but content.







Beyond my wish I'm favourd by my Fate.
Heav'ns, must I be Mirtillos Advocate.
Oh kind Ergasto, a more pleasing task
Thou could'st not grant, nor could Corisca ask. aside.

Under the Name of Amaryllis Friend,
I have fit means, and safe, to work my end.








My dear Amaryllis here?




Yes kind Corisca, all that's left of her.
I'm to be Married; all that once was mine,
My freedom, and my heart, all that was thine;
My friendship and my smiles, are ours no more;
They are all seiz'd by a commanding Pow'r.





Do not with needless fears disturb your peace:
Why must your freedom and our friendship cease?
There's no such Fetters, no such dangers wait
Upon the sweet and happy Marryed state.




Happy and Sweet Alass

What of him Oh that blest Name.

Only I have saved his Life.




His Life! How came
His Life in danger?





By his dispair for you.
That hour he first your fatal Contract knew,
The k•…lling sound no doubt had mortal prov'd,
Had not my kindness half his pain remov'd;
"By promising to break this Match, which though
"I only said to comfort him, I know
The way if need were 






Can thy kind help this cruel Gordian break?








My better Angel, how?







To break this Marriage off, if you would please
T' assist me, is a thing I'de do with ease.





Unkind Corisca, had you in your pow'r
This blessing, and conceal'd it till this hour?
Well, though you hide your secrets, yet take mine:
Know when I think I must my heart resign,
"And all my Life, be subject to a Boy,
That hates me, and does place his only joy
In Woods, in Beasts, in Dogs, and Hunts-mens crys;
That thought to my wrack'd soul all Peace denys.
Why was I born of Heav'nly race for this?
"Happy that poor and humble Shepherdess,
"Who has not half my weighty Cares to keep
"Her heart awake; who feeds her Master's Sheep
"With the pearld grass, and with her lovely eyes,
"Some honest Swain, that for her Beauty dyes.
"Not such as Men or Gods choose to her hand,
"But such as Love did to her choyce commend.
"And in some favour'd shady mirtle Grove,
"Desires, and is desired, and lives all Love.
"This only is true Bliss, which till the breath
"Deserts the body, knows not what is Death.
"Would Heav'n had made me such a one.






I'le wish; to save you 'tis not yet too late.





"Not late! My Faith I have already given
"Both to my Father, and what's worse, to Heav'n:
"And break with them I neither will, nor may.
"But if your Industry can find a way
"T'unty this Knot, so that my Honesty,
"My Faith, my Fame, and my Religion be
"Preserved, how blest, how proud 





Leave it to me.

Coriscas Glory, and her pow'r, this day,
In all their colours shall their Pride display.

  18"But when from an ill Husband thou art freed,
"May not an honest Lovers hopes succeed?

Mirtillo you must Love, you shall nay mo•…e,
Must give him leave to see you, and adore.





"'swere better he'd in peace and silence rest,
"And root so vain a love out of his Breast.




"Some comfort you shall give him e're he dye.



Half favours do but heighten misery.



"If they do so, the seeking is his own.



"And what must I expect, should it be known?



"How Cowardly thou art.




"And may I still
"Be Cowardly in any thing that's ill.





"And can you fail me in this small request.
"Farewell; so may I fail thee in the rest.









"If you'l promise me
"To hear Mirtillo.






Well, I'le promise thee
To hear him; but provided it may be
But once.









"And that he may not know
"We meet with my consent or knowledg.






You cannot think I'le be so indiscr•…et.
I'le make him think 'tis by my plot you meet.
Trust to my care; your safety in my hand,
Your faithful Creatures pow'r and Life command.











Yes, trust me, I will serve thee; but as Hell
Serves Sinners; I will lead her fairly on
Till past Redemption lost, she is undone.
She Loves Mirtillo:

And Rivalship enflames me to that height,
That now I love him at that senseless rate,
That for his sake I'de startle at no crime.
Nay, I could e'ne turn Fool, and Marry him.




"Oh Amaryllis I am caught, I am caught;
Stay and assist me.





No, she hears thee not.
"Thou Mrs. in the art of making Lyes,
"That sell'st false looks, false hopes at such a price,
"With honesty stampt on thy haughty brow,
None of thy falsehoods shall deceive me now.




To me this barbrous Language?





Now I'le reward thee for thy Treachery,
Thou Cheat, Dissembler, Witch, and Sorceress;
Perjur'd Corisca.






"Yes, I do confess
"I am Corisca; not that happy she,
"Who once was Courted and beloved by thee,
My gentle dear Sylvano.







What sweetning words, what a new stile is here?
Oh the Conversions that are wrought by fear.
Was this the language, this the humble look,
When Me for the young Thyrsis you forsook?
And from that heart, just sealed to me before,
All your repeated Oaths to Niso swore.





Who, I •…orsake thee? take back the lest part
From thee of that intire devoted heart,
Which is thy sacred right.






No, no; Your constancy can never change!
Since of your Crimes you can forgetsul be,
My Vengeance shall refresh your memory.




Vengeance! Oh Heavens, on whom?




On thee Enchantress, thee fair Infidel;
Thou hast not playd the Traytors part so well,
As I will do the Lovers. Thanks kind pow'rs,
After so many sighs and tedious hours,

  20My Life and Fortune's spent to buy your smiles,
Kind Fate at last rewards my weary toyls,
And my false fair one, now I'le tryumph in the spoyls.
Since so much Hell within your Bosom reigns,
I'le Conjure all the Devils in your Veins.





Oh Horrour! My soft Peace, how can you fright?
Can you hurt her whom once you call'd your dear delight?
What Faith in Men can Wretched Virgins find,
If my Sylvano ceases to be kind.





Cease to be kind to thee. By Heav'n not I,

I'le be so kind 




Oh my hard destiny!




 That not thy Father, when in all his heat,
And Youth, he did thy wanton Mother treat,
To raise this Cursed race to damne Man-kind,
Was ever half so hot, or half so kind.
He, lazy Nuptial Fool did only move
In the dull humane Path of making Love▪;
But I'le turn Ravisher, and sport like Jove.





"Behold me at thy feet. Oh pardon me,
"If ever I by chance offended thee,
"My Idol; by those God-like looks, these more
"Than humane Knees, which clasping, I adore.
"By thy dear self Sylvano; thy more dear
"Affection which thou once to me didst swear:
"By the sweet influence of those Eyes, which thou
"Wert wont to call two Stars, two Fountains now.





T' extract these Tears, what wonders have I done?
Such soft Dew falls not after every Sun.




Dear Sylvan, pitty me, and let me go.



"Thinkst thou still Syren to deceive me? No.




Oh let me go, try me but once, and see
How just, how fai•…hful, and how kind I'le be.





No, I am grown too wise to credit thee;
"And he that takes thy word, himself ensnares,
"Beneath this humble shew, beneath these Prayers.

  21"Is hid Corisca. I too long delay.
My Pleasure and Revenge calls me away.
Come my fair Martyr.






Hear me but one word more.




You beg in vain.




Have you no pitty left? shall I obtain
No Mercy?





None, I'le drag you to my Cave,
And no more treat you as my Saint, but Slave.
There, Oh my Vengeance! Oh my pleasure!












As firm as Fate, and less to be controul'd.
Have you done whining?





"Oh thou base, and not
"To be exampled Slave, half Man, half Goat,
"And all a Beast; thou Natures Out-cast, born
For her Disgrace, and for Corisca's Scorn.
"Corisca Loves thee not! thou think'st the truth;
"What should she see in such a Charming Youth?





Now your true self appears; but do not think
Curses or Prayers shall make Sylvano shrink.





Infernal Beast, let go your hold, be gone:
Think not the impious deed's so easily done.
That minute thy Impiety shall dare
But touch me, with my shrieks I'le fill the Ayre;
And call down all Heav'ns Thunder on thy head:
Nay, I'le turn Basilisk, and look thee dead.





Call Thunder down! as if the Gods would hear
Thy out cryes Devil. I so little fear
Heav'ns Anger for so just, so brave an act,
That in the very height of all the Fact,
I'le with such pride the glorious deed commit,
That I•…le my self call Heav'n to witness it.





Hell and Damnation thy black soul confound,
And everlasting Horrour shade me round.







Too gentle: In this posture I appear
More like a Courtier than a Ravisher.
Fur•…'s the garb my I•…j'ries should wear:
Beast as thou art, I'le drag thee by the hair.

Lets go her Arms, and twists his hands in her Hair.

My Rage cannot commit an act too foul:
Fright me away? I'm not that easie Fool 

As he drags her away, her Hair comes off; and Sylvano falls; at which time she runs off.

Perdition seize her. Oh she's gone; was e're
Such an Escape, such a defeat as here!
"Was ever man so Fooled! Thou all made up of Wiles,
"Was't not enough thy words, thy looks, thy smiles
Were all deceit; false, treacherously fair,
"But you must likewise falsifie your hair.
"The glowing Amber, and the flowing Gold
"Which you, mad Poets, so extol, behold!
"Blush, blush now at your errour, and recant
"Your thread-bare Theam; instead whereof, go paint
"The arts of a deform'd and impious Witch;
"Breaking up Sepulch•…es by Night; from which
"She steals the hair, which upon Deaths-head grows,
"To Imp her own; which she so neatly does,
"That she has made you praise, what you shou'd more
"Then dire Megaeras Snaky locks abhor.











To follow Sylvio, is that a Crime?
I'de wander o're the World to follow him.
Not Savage Desarts with their Beasts of prey,
And all their frightful Rocks should stop my way.





Come dear Dorinda, do not figh in vain;
Come Love no more, but shake off all this pain.
Should Maids, in wild Young Men, place their delig•…t;
Alas, they're Creatures not to please, but fright.






You were young once, and if you told me true,
You said You Lov'd, And did they frighten you?





But when I Loved, 'twas at a Womans Age.
I stood upon my Guard against their rage.
I was more able too the storm to bear:
But they are Creatures which You ought to sear.
Ravenous as Lyons, and more fierce than they:
Whilst Slavish▪ Women must their Wil•…s obey,
And to their furious Appetites give way:
They have desires, to which You cannot bow.




But you have tryed, and you shall tell me how.




Poor Innocence, you know not what you say:
There's Debt, in Love, you are too young to pay.
Alas, thou'rt Ignorant 




Why then I'de learn.



Alas, your own desires you can't discern.




To please my Love, What is it that I want?
Can he ask any thing I cannot grant?
No, I have so much Love, that I believe,
I've rather more than I know how to give.
Instruct me, for I'de please him if I cou'd.
What are those Debts? I know they must be good.
Love is a God, I've heard our Shepherds say:
And all that Gods command, we should obey.
If I've more hearts than yet I understand,
Tell me, they shall be all at his command.





Inquire no farther pretty Innocence,
But think of Loving Sylvio seaven years hence.




And must I stay so long, so long a time?



Your Beauty then will be in all its prime.




Have I not all my Beauty yet? is it▪
For that my Sylvio ca•…not Love me yet?
My wants in Beauty are this way supply'd,
I've Love enough, what e're I want beside.





Do but observe the Beauties of the May:
Yours will be once as ripe, and bright as they.
Stay till your worth is better understood.
All these gay flowers were once but in the Bud.






Must Virgins then grow up as Roses do?
Pray, how is that?





To Age their Sweets they owe.
Whilst by th'warm Sun, and the kind Spring, they blow.





If then my want of growth be all my fau't,
Me-thinks I need not stay seav'n years for that.
Let but my Sylvio Love me: He has such charms▪
Me-thinks I could shoot up in Sylvios Arms.
His charming looks would make me any thing.
So kind a Sun would soon bring on the Spring.





Stay Sylvio, do not flye me.





Cannot such suppliant Beauty stop your way?





My Torment here. aside.

To stay, I want the pow'r.
I've no time now to fool away an hour.





Inhumane; is this treat a recompence
For all the groans of dying Innocence?
Thou man, more barbarous than the Scythian Race,
And Savager than the wild Beasts you chace.





Dearer than Life, and sweeter than the Spring.
My Joy, my Love, my Heart, my every thing.
Oh unkind Nymph, can you so Cruel prove,
To talk so harshly to the Man I Love?
Dear Sylvio What have I said 
Me-thinks I blush, yet why, I do not know.
Something I've said or done, I should not do.
To say I Love him, there's no sin in that:
To tell the truth, sure cannot be a Fau't.
And yet me-think 
A secret shame into my face does flye,
And says 'tis men should Court, and Maids deny.




What is the cause fair Nymph 




Fair Nymph! Ah no:
You call me fair, but do not think me so.





What idle frenzy can so pow'rful be,
To make you take such pains to follow me?






Why do you ask? As if you did not know.
I would be near you whereso're you go:
Do, let me follow you, let me be near.
"I'le hold your Arrows, and your Quiver bear:
And if your precious Life should e're,
By the wilde Bore you chace, in danger be,
I'le step between, and he shall first Kill me.
In Sylvio's presence is my sole delight:
On you •… think all Day, and dream all Night.
And in the Morning, when by restless Cares
I early wake, and go to say my Pray'rs,
All on a sudden, when I kneeling bow,
And think I speak to Heav'n, I Pray to You.
Yet unkind Sylvio from Dorinda flyes.
Takes all my Heart, yet gives me none of His.





Why do you throw away a heart so ill?
I never yet knew Love, nor ever will.
Or if I did, 'tis in the Chace, the Groves
And Woods: My Hawks and Hounds have all my Loves.





In Love with Hawks and Hounds! Those Crea∣tures, Sir, have got
Their Loves already. They're by Nature taught
To Love amongst themselves. Those humble Creatures too,
Are not deserving to be Loved by You.





Well Nymph, I see I wrong you by my stay;
I'le take the Cause then of your Grie•…s away.
Adieu.





Stay but one minute; must we part
So soon? I see the cause of all my smart:
'Tis Amaryll is takes up all your heart.






That little satisfaction you shall have,
I gave my hand; my heart I never gave.




Do you not Love her then?



By Heav'ns, not I.



Does she want Charms?



Their Influence I defie.



But are you sure you do not Love her?









Do you not think, and wish you know not how,
And Dream of her a Nights, as I of You?





I think not of her waking, nor asleep,
My heart does no such worthless Triffles keep.





You've eas'd me of I know not how much pain:
I'm Charm'd to hear you ta•…k with such disdain.
Malice or Love, or both, what e're it be,
I'm pleas'd he Loves not her, though he hates me.

The Hunts-men hollow from within.




Hark, I am call'd, my pleasure I delay.
Farewell.




You shall not go.



I must not stay.



Have you no Love, nor pitty, cruel Man?



I pitty you as much as e're I can.






If by your Hate I'm Doom'd to be undone;
I'm the first slighted Maid that dyed so soon.






For the unrest, the sighs, and pains, so long
You've borne, in Charity t'a thing so young,
For once I will be kind.





Will you be kind?
Kind to Dorinda! Oh my lightned mind? 
And will you Love me? I ne're lived till now. 
Shall I be you•…s? My Joys too mighty grow.
If the unrest I've borne your kindness win,
To keep you kind, I'le never sleep agen.
And if you▪ve Charity, because I'm young,
Be sure I'le ne're grow old but why so long
A silence? why this distance? Did you say
You would be kind, and do not know the way.
Swa•…ns, when they're kind, their dearest Nymphs approach,
With all their greedy joys their hands they touch,
And kiss 'em o're and o're.
Then round their Necks their twining Arms they throw:
Were I a Swain in Love, I should do so.





Hold gentle Nymph, and give me leave to speak.
Do not my promis d Charity mistake,

  27Your softness has my stubborn spirit bow'd
So much, that I would Love you if I could.
And this Effeminate Confession, none
Of your whole Sex could win, but you alone.




And is it thus, you're kind?




Love I ne're can.
Within my Breast that Feaver never ran.
You have my Pitty; all I can I'le g•…ant.
Nor will I say I Love you, when I cant.









My kindness is so great,
I will not pay your Love with Counterfeit.
Nay, in compassion to your sighs and tears,
Each rising Sun shall hear my Zealous Prayers:
I'le beg kind Heav'n that you may Love no more,
And your Conversion on my knees implore.
Once more fare-well.





Why all this hasty flight?
Stay, and be cruel still, and kill me quite.







E'ne let him go, and to requite this scorn,
May he by Heaven's pursuing Vengeance, torne
By some wild Monster in a Desart dye,
And injur'd Virgins curse his memory.
The noyse comes near; •…ye hence, no longer stay;
What if the Savage Beast should come this way,
And Chafed with Hunting, spill your precious blood?





Alas, I would forgive him, if he •…nou'd.
Since unkind Sylvio from my Love does flye,
Young though I am, I'm Old enough to dye.










WHy does the foolish World mistake,
And Loves dull praises sing so loud?
What idle Subjects must they make,
Who choose a blind and Childish Boy their God?


What dearer Joys our Freedom brings,
Whilst the wing'd Quire on every bough,
Charm'd with our Bliss in Consort sings,
And Night and Day our harmless pleasures view.

Chor. 'Tis Shame and the Night Loves folly does cover,
And only the Bat and Schreich-Owl that hover
About the dark Windows of a drowzy dull Lover.



The Song ended, they Dance, which done, they go off sing∣ing, and Corisca enters and stays Amaryllis.
Manent only Corisc. and Amar.




"I Must go speak to him, or he'l not stir.
"To her faint-hearted Swain; what do you fear?









I would approach her, but dare move no nigher:
"How near to Impotence is strong desire?




Make hast, or she is lost.

"Love is not rude.




Can it be rudeness when I kneel before

Is it a Crime t'approach what we admire.
Do but observe, fair Nymph, how the wing'd Quire,
Each wandring Bird flyes over Woods and Groves,
To mix its Ayr•…s with the dear Mate it loves.
And what their Loves and weaker sense has done,
Should dastard Man, the Lord of Reason shun?

"Live then is you do love me, and adieu.





And must I live for ever in despair;
Doom'd to a Life that is not worth my care?






Mirtillo, 'tis high time you went away,
"You have already made too long a stay:
Be gon, and let your griefs not grow too strong,
"Of hopeless Lovers, there's a numerous throng.
"There is no wound, but carryes with it pain;
"And there are others, who of Love complain.




How can I leave you?




Why, Sir, should you stay?
You know my heart's already given away.
You know I'm to be Marryed Sir, yet still 
Oh Heav'ns! I'de like t'have said against my will. aside.

Be gone, be gone 
For should he longer stay aside.

I shall the weakness of my soul betray.




Why must I flye so sast from all that's dear?




Should but the Nymphs return, a•…d find you here,
This place they hold so sacred, that they'd tear
You Limb from Limb: "The Thracian Nymphs ne're tore,
"And Murder'd Orpheus so on Hebrus shore.





Is that a fear should drive Mirtillo hence?
What if the place be sacred; the offence
Proceeds from Love, and Love is sacred too;
They could not hurt the Slave that dyes for you.





He has staid too long; his presence has such pow'r  aside.

My Father I expect this very hour:

  32And if he find you here, I shall pull down
A Nations anger and a Fathers frown.
Sir, for my safety go.





That word alone could force
Me hence; "but can I suffer this Divorce,
"And yet not dye; the pangs of death I'm sure
"I feel, and all that parting souls endure.






"Mirtillo, oh Mirtill•…, couldst thou see
"That heart which thou condemn'st of cruelty,
"Soul of my soul, thoud'st find it so much thine,
Thoud'st give me pitty, and not ask me mine.
"Oh why, if Love be such a natural
"And pow'rful passion, is it Capital?
"Law too severe that Nature doest offend,
"Nature too frail that dost with Law contend.
Why must our bleeding hearts with sorrow break,
Whilst modesty forbids our Sex to speak?
"Oh dear Mirtillo, pardon thy fierce Foe,
"In words and looks, but in her heart not so.
"But if addicted to Revenge thou be?
"What greater Vengeance canst thou take on me,
"Then thy own grief? For, if thou beest my heart,
"As in despite of Heav'n and Earth thou art;
"Thy sighs my Vital spirits are; the flood
"Of tears which follows, is my vital blood.
"And all these pangs, and all these groans of thine,
"Are not thy pangs, are not thy groans, but mine.







Why pangs and gro•…ns? what should your peace destroy?
What hinders your desires, or bars your Joy?
Come, you must love Mirtillo: Why so coy?





What do you mean? You know our breach of Faith
Is punisht by th' Arcadian Laws with death?





And is it that dull Nymph keeps you in awe?
"Wh•…ch is more ancient, tell me, Love or Law?
Love's a Majestick pow'r;
Came in with Nature, and grew up with Man,
And with the world its Soveraignty began.

  33Laws were but Innovations crept in since,
Which envying Loves Imperial Excellence,
Like Rebels Circumscribed an Absolute Prince.





Oh Heavens! I scarce dare guess at what you mean:
But could I thy wild Counsels entertain,
"And for th'offence, the Law my Life should take;
"Can Love of Life a Restitution make?





"Thou art too nice: If Women all were such,
"And on thy scruples should insist too much:
"Good days adieu.
"Laws are not for the Wise. If to be kind
"Should merit death, •…ove help the cruel mind.
"But if Fools fall into those Snares, 'tis fit
"They be forbid to steal, that have not wit
"To hide their Theft.





Hold: this wild subject change.
You starrle me to hear you talk so strange.






One minute of our Life's not in our pow'rs,
And who but Fools would lose whole days or hours? ▪

Celia, convert her with that Song I taught you.






"Let us use time whilst we may;

"Snatch those joys that hast away,

"Earth her Winter▪ Coat may cast,

"And renew her Bea•…ties past;

"But our Winter come, in vain

"We solicite Spring again.

"And when our Furrows Snow shall cover;

"Love may return, but never Lover.





"Thou say'st all this only to try me sure:
"Not that thy thoughts are such; but rest secure,
Unless the way to break this Contract be
A plain safe way; from guilt and scandal free:
Your useless Councels you propose in vain;
"I'de dye a thousand Deaths e're I'de my Honour stain.






"But Amaryllis, dost thou seriously
"Believe thy Sylvio rates his Faith as high,
"As thou dost thine?





Alas, how should I know?
"What's Faith to him, who is to Love a Foe?





"Loves Foe! There's thy mistake: Oh these coy souls.
"Believe 'em not. The deep stream silent rowls.
"No Theft in Love so subtle and secure,
"As to hide sin by seeming to be pure.
"In short, thy Sylvio Loves, but 'tis not thee.
"He Loves else-where.





"What Goddess must she be.
"For certainly she's not of mortal frame
"That could the heart of Sylvi•… inflame.
Where are her Altars, what's this Goddess Name?




"No Goddess, nor yet Nymph.



"What was't you said?



"Do you know my Lisetta?





"That tends thy Flocks?




"The same: She's all his joy.



"A proper choyce for one that was so coy.




But will you know what Magick's in her Arms,
And what great pains he takes to meet her Charms.
"He feigns to go a Hunting. But i'ch' heat
"Of all the sport, he does by stealth retreat
"From his Companions, and comes all alone
"Into my Garden, by a way unknown.
"Where underneath a Haw-thorne-hedges shade,
"The Gardens sence, the poor expecting Maid
"Hears his hot sighs and amorous pray'rs; which she
"Comes Laughing afterwards, and tells to me.









Now hear my plot, and let my Friendship prove
My' industrious Zeal to Crown your Sacred Love.

  35"I think you know, that the same Law which does
"Enjoyn the Woman to observe her Vows
"To her Contracted, likewise does Enact,
"That if the Woman catch him in the fact
"Of falsehood, all her tyes and contracts cease,
And she'has free pow'r to Marry where she please.





"I know Examples. Egle having found
"Lycotas false, remaind her self unbound.





"Now hear me out: My Maid by me set on,
"Has bid her Credulous Lover meet anon
"In yonder Cave with her, whence he remains
"The most contented of all living Swains.
"And waits but th'hour. You shall surprize him there:
"And I too as your Witness, will be near.





Already I've a prospect of my Bliss.
"I like it rarely, but the way 






"In th'middle of the Cave, oth' right hand, lyes
"Another lesser Grot. There thou shalt hide
"Thy self; and hidden in that place abide
"Till the two Lovers come: I mean to send
"Lisetta first, and after her, her Friend;
"Following aloofe my self; and when I have
"Perceiv'd him safely Lodg'd within the Cave,
I will rush after him, and at my cryes
You shall come in, and the false Swain surprize:
"That done, shall take the penalty oth'Law:
"I, and Lisetta then will straight with-draw,
"And to the Priest; and then thou shalt untye
"This Fatal Knot.










"What matters that? Think'st thou Montanoes blood
"Will stand in Ballance with his Countrys good.





"Go on then; setting all disputes aside,
"I wink, and follow thee my faithful Guide.




"Then linger not, dear Nymph, but enter in.




Before this mighty enterprize begin,

  36I'le to the Temple, and the Gods adore:
And by my Prayers from Heav'n, success implore.






"Go, and return then quickly. How I'm pleas'd!
Of half my Troubles I'm already eas'd.
"But to go on, there's something must be done
"T'abuse my honest Lover Coridon:

"I'le say I'le meet him in the Cave, and so
"Will make him after Amaryllis go.
"That done, by a back-way I'le thither send
"The Priest of Cynthia, her to Apprehend;
"Guilty she will be found, and by our Laws she dyes▪
The cause of all Mirtilloes Crueltyes.




"He's here I'le sound him till she comes: Now rise,
"Rise all my Love into my Tongue, and Eyes.





"Hear ye damnd Spirits that in Hell lament,
"Hear a new sort of pain and punishment:
"See in a Turtles look a Tygers mind;
"She crueller than death, 'cause she did find
"One death could not suffice her bloody will;
"And that to live was to be dying still,
"Enjoyns me not to make my self away,
"That I may dye a thousand times a day.





How fares your Love, Mirtillo, since you came▪
From your dear charming Ny mph  Curse on the Name






"As one who in a violent Feaver cast,
"And is forbidden Liquor, longs to tast.
"Which got, he greedily sets to his mouth,
"And th•…s he quenches Life, but cannot Drouth.





"Love over us, no pow'r can e're receiv•…

"But what our slavish selves, Mirtillo, give,
"When by his fond desires mans soul is brought.
"So poorly to be fetter'd to one thought;
"Love quickly Tyrannizes in his Breast,
"And straight grows up a Master from a Guest.





Should not one Thought fill up Mirtilloes heart▪
Is her•… a Beauty to deserve but part?






"How weak, how ill a bargain foolish Swain,
"You make, to exchange kindness for disdain?





"The Cruelty of Beauty does refine
"A Lovers Faith, as fire the golden Mine.
"Where were the Sacred Loyalty of Love,
"If charming Women did not Tyrants prove.





"Oh wretched and unhappy those, in whom
"That foolish Idol, Constancy finds room.
"Come rouze, Mirtillo, know your nobler parts.
"Look out, you cannot want a thousand hearts.





Though scorn'd and hated, I had rather fall
Her dying Victim, than command 'em all.





Oh horrour! how he tortures me. aside.


You are possest with some kind f•…attering thought,
That though an outward Scorn she's pleas'd to show,
Like burning Mountains cover'd o're with Snow,
There's heat within. Enchanted Dreamer, no.





"These are but Trophies of my constant Love,
"By which I'le Tryumph o're the Gods above;
"O're Men below, my Torments and her Hate;
"O're Fortune and the World, o're Death and Fate.





"Wonder of Constancy! If this Man knew
"How much he's loved by her, what would he do. aside.


Mirtillo, were you e're in Love before.




Her, and her only can my soul adore.




Then it should seem your Heart was never laid,
But at the Feet of some disdainful Maid.
"Oh that 't had been thy chance but once to be
"In Love with one that's gentle, curteous, free.
"Try that a little, try it, and thou'lt find
"How sweet it is to meet with one that's kind.
"How pleasant 'tis to have thy Mrs. twine
"About thy Neck, and her sighs eccho thine.
"And after say, my Joy, All that I have,
"All that I am, and thy desires can crave,
"At thy Devotion is. If I am fair;
"For thee I'm fair; for thee I deck this hair.

  38"This Face, this Bosom, from this Breast of mine,
"I turn'd out my own heart to harbour thine.





Happy's the man that's born under a Star
So fortunate!





"Dull Swain; a Nymph as fair
"As the proud'st she that curles and spreads to th'Ayr
"Her Beauteous Tresses, worthy of thy Love,
"As thou of hers: The Honour of this Grove,
"Love of all hearts, by every worthier Swain,
"In vain solicited, adored in vain,
"Does Love thee only, and thee only prize
"More than her Life, and for that Love she dyes.





If such a Nymph there be, conceal her Name;
To all my other Tortures add not shame.
Let me not know she suffers for my sake,
And blush to think I no return can make.




"How▪ ever try what kindness is, tast both.



"Distemper'd Pallats all sweet things do loath.




"Uncharitable Youth, art not thou poor,
"And cant'st thou beat a Beggar from thy door?





"What Alms can Beggars give? Alas, I've Sworn
Allegiance, and a Traytor cannot turn.





"Blind Youth, who is it thou art constant to?
"I am unwilling to add Woe to Woe.
But can I see thee Cheated and Betray'd;
Her Honour sold, thy Sighs her pass-time made,
And yet not speak? "No doubt but you suppose,
"This Cruelty from her strict Vertue grows:
Thou art abused; that tiresome Vanity,
Call'd Innocence, she has long since laid by.




And can your profanation swell so high?













In wilfull Ignorance, and be undone.




"Oh Torture! I must dye if this be true.




"No, live dull Man, and thy Revenge pursue.
And though I know it will your heart-strings tear,
Her falsehood I must speak, and you must hear.

  39"Then to convince you, see you yonder Cave;
"That is your Mrs. Faith and Honours Grave.
"In short, there oft a base-born Shepheard warms
"Thy Virtuous Amaryllis in his Arms.
There she her Bliss, her Life, her Heav'n does find:
The Ivy to the Oak's not half so kind.
"Now go and sigh, and whine, and constant prove
"To that kind Nymph that thus rewards thy Love.





"Ah me Corisca, dost thou tell me true?
"And is it fit I should believe thee too?





"Truth is, I did not see it, but thou may'st,
"And 〈◊〉, for she her word has past
"To 〈◊〉 there this very hour. But hide
"Thy self beneath this shady Hedges side,
"And thou shalt see her enter into th'Cave,
And after her, her happy amorous Slave.




"So quickly must I dye?




"See, I have spyed
"Her coming down, already by the side
"O'th' Temple. Mark how guiltily she moves;
"Her stealing pace betraying their stolne Loves.
"To mark the sequel, do you here remain,
"And afterwards we two will meet again.






"Since the discovery of the Truth's so near,
"With my Belief I will my Death defer.







"I from the Temple come as light as Ayre:
How much Heav'n listens to a Virgins prayer?
"I kneel'd and pray'd, and strait I felt, me-thought,
"Another soul into my body sho•….
"Which whisper'd, fear not, Amaryllis, go
"Securely on. Yes, and I will do so,
"Heav'n guiding me. Fair Queen of Love, befriend
"Her, who on thee for succour does depend:
"Thou that as Queen in the third Orb doest shine,
"If e're thou selt'st thy Sons flames, pitty mine.
An humbler Votaress ne're kneelt before thy Shrine.
"Securely Enter; oh Mirtillo, oh Goes into the Cave.

"Mirtillo▪ could'st thou dream for what I go.






"I wake and see what I could wish t'have been
"Born without Eyes, that I might not have seen.
"Or rather not to have been born; curst Fate,
"Why hast thou thus prolong'd my Lifes sad Date?
"To bring me to this killing Spectacle!
"Mirtillo more tormented than in Hell.
Dye then, Mirtillo dye How dye, and give
The Traytor leave my Ruine to out-live.
"You that enjoy my spoyls, who e're you are,
"Since I must fall, shall my Destruction share.
Back to my Covert then I will repair,
And when the Villain shall approach, he dyes▪
"But is't not base to kill him by surprize?
"What if her Wrongs I openly should right?
"That would proclaim the cause for which we fight.
"Dye basely then thou base Adulterer,
"That hast slain me, and hast dishonour'd her.
"I, but the blood may, if I kill him here,
"The Murder show, and that the Murderer.
"What need I care? Yes, but the Murther know•…,
"Betrays the cause, for which the Murder's done.
But her staind blood, has not so quencht my flame;
I'de ▪kill her Guilt, but would not wound her fame.
"Close then in branches on the Rocks left side,
"Within the mouth oth' Cave, my self I'le hide:
And when I see her impious Minion come,
I'le gi•…e th' Adulterer and her shame one Tomb.




"And your dear foot-steps which I long have trac'd
"In vain, un-erring path lead me at last
"To where my Love is hid. To You I bow,
"Your Print I follow. Oh Corisca, now
"I do believe thee. Now thou hast told me true.

Goes into the Cave.




"Does he believe Corisca, and pursue
"Her steps to Eryc•…nas Cave? A Beast

  41"Has Wit enough to apprehend the rest.
Is there a Devil like a Woman damnd
In Lust? Not Hell is half so much inflam'd?
Her guilt and shame is but too plain,
"This Strumpet to this Swain her self has sold
Bewitching Lust, but more bewitching Gold.
"And here by the false Light now of this Vault,
"Delivers the bad ware which he has bought;
"Or rather 'tis Heav'ns Justice that has sent
"Her hither, to receive her punishment
"From my Revenging hands. The words he said,
"Seem'd to imply some promise she had made,
"Which he believed: and by his spying here
"Her print, that she's within the Cave, 'tis cleer.
"Do wisely then, and stop the mouth oth' Cave
"With that great hanging stone, that they may have
"No means of scaping; to the Priest then go,
"And bring by the back way, which few men know,
"His Ministers to take her in the fact;
And by her death, my dearest Vengeance act.
Justice, Revenge, Heav'n and my injur'd Love,
Joyn all your pow'rs with mine, this Rock to move.

Shuts the Cave with a piece of the Rock.

"So now the Fox is trapt, and finely shut
"Where she had Earth'd her self. I'l•… straight go put
"Fire to the hole; where I could wish to find

"THis day has Heav'n and Earth, Nature & Art,
"Fortune and Fate, Friend and Foe ta'ne my part.
"How much more happily (to make her sin
"Look more like Truth) Fate brought Mirtillo in,
"Then I contriv'd to have brought Coridon?

And how as luckily was that great stone
Roul'd by Sylvano o're the mouth o'th' Cave?
Who cou'd expect such Service from that Slave?








Corisca here! thou damn'd perfidious Cheat;

I thought by this I had cur'd your amorous heat.
How comes it, Devil, that I find thee here?





To find me here, where lyes the wonder? where,
Did you expect me?





To have found thee Fool'd,
Snar'd and betray'd, thy wanton courage cool'd;
Led to a Temple, there t'have undergone
That punishment my Vengeance had pull'd down,
And thy loud Crimes deserv'd: I thought I shou'd
Have seen
Shame written in thy Fore-head, and thy Blood.









Was not that Stone enough
To hold ye? are not Rocks and Marble proof
Against the Assaults of Lust? How got ye off?
Speak Sorceress!




What does the Traytor mean?





Of Villany, t'escape the Minister
Of Justice, which I sent to seize you there?

  43Have you broke Prisons, or subverted Laws,
Or baffled Justice; made your impious cause
Like those fair looks which your false colours paint;
Acted a Devil and appea•…'d a Saint?
Which of 'em was't? or was it all? say, how?
All this betwitching Womans power can do.





I scorn thy Imputations savage Slave.
'Twas Amaryllis that was found i'th'Cave.
And with Mirtillo caught, th'Adultress dyes.
Can thy black soul, with all its Treacheries,
Father on guiltless me thy barb'rous Lyes.





Did he not name your Name in entring in,
And say you had told him true Oh I begin
To find the Cheat; some trick to take her head.
Nothing that's truth can from thy tongue proceed.
I'le to the Priest, and clear her of the guilt.
No blood but thine shall by my rage be spilt.
I'le swear thy Treasons, and her death prevent;
And false, or true, I'le prove her Innocent.







Sylvano stay, and hear me e're you go.
God's! for a little of the Woman now.
This Villain, if his flight I do not stay, aside.

Will ruine all my Love, and all my Plots betray.
You've often said you Lov'd Corisca.









And she has often said that she lov'd you.



And I, Fool as I was, believ'd you too.




Why was that Faith a Crime? how can you still
See by false lights, and read my thoughts so ill?
How oft my seeming falsehood you've pursu'd,
Even to my death, and sought my guiltless blood?
Nay, when your Jealousie so high could swell;
And your blind fears, you thought, discern'd so well,
You see kind Heav'n your Errour does prevent,
And, cruel Man, you find me Innocent.





Because I once have had a false distrust,
Therefore my Jealousie must ne're be just.





Well, if I am still that Monster you suppose,

  44However, sure some signe of Love it shews;
When I can •…amely hear you treat me thus,
And yet forgive a style so infamous.





Oh Syren, canst thou Love? how many Rogues,
And Villains, odious Slaves, and hated Dogs,
Have I been cal•…'d; and treated like'em too?
Do, call this Love, yes perju•…'d Woman, do.





To those harsh words, I was by passion d•…iven:
Things done in storms, should be in calmes forgiven.
Besides, I have been treated too as ill;
And yet through all your Rage, you Lov'd me still.





And you deserv'd it; you ca•…'t less than prove
A Miracle of Faith, of Truth and Love:
You've such a wondrous stock: a•…k Corydon,

Philander, Strephon, Niso, Clitophon,
Philisides, Geron, Thyrsis, Doreo.
By all those Legions of your Loves you're true.





How can your fears such wild Ch•…maera's frame?
Can you my harmless Conversation blame?





How harmlesly you •…heir kind Visits paid,
Witness the Assignations you have made,
The Presents you •…eceiv'd, the cursed Gold,
For which your Vows were broke, and Honour sold.





Can you object the Gifts and Treats they made•…

And think those Tributes were with Love repaid?
Our Companies requite the Treats we take,
And our Acceptanc•… pays the Gifts they make.

•… kept'em Company was it ill done
To hear all Loves, w•…en I receiv'd but one?









She bestows a worthless heart,
Whose seeble Eyes, had never but one Dart.
'Tis a dull prize that's never sought but once▪
But thus their weak pretences I r•…nounce:
I'm all Sylvano's sacred and entire.




Magick and Witchcraft, I shall take new fire.




Alas, I made you Jealous on design,
T' assure your▪Love before I made you mine.

  45Since Marriage is a Bond that tyes till death,
Could I have too much tryal of your Faith?





Death and the Devil! I am snar'd agen.
T•…e •…ame and silly loving Fool's got in.





Men best express how Treasures they esteem
By the concern they shew in losing 'em.
Your •…age and storms to think me perjur'd, prove
The violence and ardence of your Love.
And to requi•…e the tedious pains you've born•…,
Accept in blushes this last just return. Gives him her hand.

To morrow at the Altar seal my heart.




Thou wilt be true, thou must by Heav'ns thou art.
Kisses her hand.




In all my Charms there my Dear Love I'le meet,
And lay my soul at kind Sylvano's feet.
But one thing I forget;
Do not defend that naughty Womans cause,
Let the lewd shameful Wretch suffer the Laws.
They have met there before, a hundred times.
But let her dye vile Creature •…or her Crimes.
I hate that odious sin so much; may all
That practice it, as much unpittyed fall.





Forgive me, if I take my self away:
To morrows Bliss permits me not to stay.
I must prepare for our dear Nuptial day.
And the bright Sun when he salutes the skie,
No Persian shall adore so much as I:

Can you suspect me now?
By my Religion and my Lise I'm true.

He had crusht my Plots, and prov'd her Innocence.
But now thanks to my Wit,

No doubt has found him work enough beside.
Proud Rival, nothing now thy Fate shall stay:

See with what hast she takes her self away;
Her guilt's so terrible, she dares not stay:

  49Yet there's such winning Beauty in her Face,
That I protest, were I to judge her case,
My tender-hearted Nature is so good,
I should forgive her sin: I Vow I shou'd.

sh' unaiding Gods can see such Virtue fall:
Where all my Vows, and all my Prayers are due,
Be not offended if thus low I bow;
You are a part of Heav'n, and 'tis my Duty now.






Mirtillo, do not chide me when I own,

A fault, my dear Mirtillo, to impart
The tender secrets of a dying heart,

That Tongue that utters it, ne're speaks agin.
And you'l soon see in Scarlet currents flow,
That blood that blushes when I tell you so.





What divine Raptures from this sweetness flow.
But after all these blessings must you dye;
Never was happiness wound up so high,
To break so soon.

Mirtillo, 'twas unkind, 'twas much unkind.




Is that the harshest name, that you can find?
Why was I made the Monster of Man-kind?
Suspect such Innocence, such goodness doubt;
No Infidel but I durst harbour such a thought.

And fall a Funeral Taper at her Urn.

Unseal your blinded Eyes.
I am that Nymph, who for Mirtillo dyes.
And once my Rivals Murder had design'd,
But thanks to Heav'n I've chang'd that bloody mind.
The Guilt's all gone, but yet the Love remains.

Mirtillo, if in pitty to my pains,
You can be moved by a sad Virgins Prayer,
To save my Life by killing my Despair:
Your hand to me before this Altar give,
And Amaryllis for that Grace shall live.




Oh horrour! what a killing sound is here?




Nor for her safety think you pay so dear.
I rob you Sir of nothing. She can ne're
Be Yours; the Bars that Destiny has thrown
Betwixt your Loves, have your vain hopes undone.






By her false Accusations let me dye.
If nothing but your Love my Life can buy,
That mighty sum do not too Prodigally pay;
That hour that takes Mirtilloes heart away,
My Death begins. Then let it gently come;
Let me not sink in Tortures to my Tomb.




Oh my wrack'd heart!




Oh my transported soul!
Was ever Love so true?






So Idle? Yes, embrace thy amorous Prize:
Fill thy fond Arms, and glut thy greedy Eyes:
But know in one half hour thy darling dyes.






Forgive me; Angel, was the word I meant. Kneels to Corisca.


Save but her Life, and be my Tutelar Saint.

'Tis no wonder Heav'n
Has such dread signs of its displeasure given:
When their own Rites they thus polluted see,
And from such stains not their own Altars free.





Is there such Treason in a parting kiss?
For ever torn from all my dearest bliss.

By all your piety, the Gods you fear,
Believe her not; that Monster do not hear.
On her own head let your kind Justice fall;
She has Cheated You, Her, Him; Betray'd you all.
Treason's her business, Poyson's in her Tears;
Perdition in her soul; she never Swears
But she is Perjur'd; if she speaks, she Lyes;
And all the Prayers she makes, are Blasphemies.





"Thou art the happiest Father, and most dear
"To the immortal Deities; see here
"The long-kept secret of our Fate made clear.
"Tears of delight in such abundance flow,
"From out my heart, I scarce can speak. Our Woe,

"Our Woe shall end when two of race Divine,



"And for a Faithless Nymphs Apostate state,
"A faithful Shepherd Supererrogate,
Of Heav'nly race is not this Youth, when thine?
And Amaryllis is of race Divine.
"And what great Sir, but Love has them combin'd?

Sylvio, by Parents and by Force was joyn'd

  62"To Amaryllis, and is yet as far
"From Loving her, as Love and Hatred are.





"In what a mist of Errors, how profound
"A night of Ignorance have I been drownd?
By every C•…cumstance 'tis evident
"The fatal Voyce, none but Mirtillo meant.
"For who indeed since slain Amintas Death
"Exprest such Love as he? such constant Faith?
"Who but Mirtillo for his Mrs. wou'd,
"Since true Amintas spend his dearest blood?
"This is that work of Supererrogation;
"This is that faithful Shepherds expiation
For the Apostate Lucrin's fact. Now Son,
Compleat a Nations joys, and Crown thy own.







Then the Immortal Treasure let me seize,
And thus kind Sir, embrace your sacred knees.





Our Loves thus Crown'd, Ergasto flye, and save
My wretched mourning Father from a Grave:
Tell him I live, and all his fears remove.




Thy Piety's as Charming as thy Love.



Break, break my heart.




But as the Gods ordein'd
T'unite your hearts, your hearts must be unstain'd.
Heav'n that preserved thy Childhood from the Flood,
By Miracle restored thee to my Blood;
And to oblige Man-kind, decreed this tye,
Could do no less than guard her Chastity.
As you dread Tortures, Death, and angry Heav'n, to Cor.

Confess her Injuries and be forgiven.
Repent, and say she's Innocent.






I wrong'd you Sir, but yet I loved you too.






Yes, she has loved him, and all Man-kind beside;
The Sex is not enough to please her Pride.




Oh how I hate that Face.



I know you do.



Dear World farewell, and all delights adieu.





Sir, as you ever Faith and Justice prize,
Hear from my tongue that Witches Sorceries.
Their Entrance to the Cave's her Plot, and laid
Only to have her Rivals Life betray'd.
And yet by all the Oaths Art could design,
Or faithless Woman ever break, she's mine.
And mine by all her Conjurations; nay
To morrow was to be our Wedding day:
And all was but a trick to take me hence,
Least I should stay to prove her Innocence.
Never did such a monstrous spurious Race
Of Nature, Heav'n, and Natures works disgrace.




Is all this Truth?









False Nymph, did You 





I know not what I did;
I Cheated Him, wrong'd Him, design'd Her Fall:
I have my Pardon, and I Own it all.





Had ever blood been so unjustly spilt.
But though I have forgiven your savage guilt,
I can't permit your breach of Faith; I must
Not only pardon you, but make you just.




I am all horrour.




If this false-Fair ones Crimes you can forgive,
And take an humble penitent Fugitive,
She's yours.









'Twas breach of Faith was the provoking guilt,
In all the sufferings Arcadia felt.
But it shall end.





You could not please me more.
This Nymph is all the Blessings I implore.
I hate her worse
Then Hell, and of all other hopes bereft, aside,

Marriage is all the dear Revenge that's left.





Is this your promis'd mercy?

  64Let me meet Wracks, Death, any thing but him.




Is this your Penitence for your pardon'd Crime?




To Marry him is all the plagues of Hell:
Adders and Scor•…ions.





No, 'tis wondrous well.
I shall Convert thee, pretty Infidel.




Have you no mercy left? no pitty Sir?



Have you no Justice le•…t? Give me but her 




Of all the Savages the World can find,
Let me but shun that Monster of the kind.





Of all the happiness of humane Life,
I only beg that Jewel, for a Wife.




Oh Sir! you Stab me, Kill me 





You'd Marry him, were Oaths esteem'd no more?
Forsaken Piety, where art thou fled?
Be just, as you wou'd save your forfeit Head.




I loath thy very sight.




And I love thee, my pretty Innocence,
As much as thy Hot blood loves Impotence.




Why then Inhumane will you Marry me?




To torture every Vein of thy false heart,
Make thy checkt pride at my dear Vengeance start.
Thy torments will a secret Joy afford.
I was thy Slave, and now shall be thy Lord.
Nor hope I'le shun thy hated Bed; in spight
I'le Tyrannize all day, and sport all night.
My Head I'le on thy perjur'd Bosom lay;
Ransack thy spoyles, and chace thy sleeps away.







Yes, Villain do, and my Revenge shall be,
I will be kind to all thy Sex, but thee:
I'le make you a worse Monster than you are.
Oh I am Mad 




A very hopefull pair.




I'le meet thy loath'd embrace in such a frightful shape,
That ev•…ry Kiss you force, shall be a Rape.




As I am doubly punisht for my Crime,
At once in losing you, and meeting him,
In pitty to the Ruins which you make,
Those few stol'n minutes from her Arms you take,
Bestow on me. You'l find me strangely good.
I'le banish all the Feavour from my blood;
And love you with desires so pure, so chast 





Stand off; the Witchcrafts of those Eyes are past:
Dear Mine, I'le lay thy wandring Devils fast.





You shall be welcome to my Soul, my Arms.
But i•… the force of her more pow'rful Charms
Hold you too sure; to make him Jealous, be
So kind, as but to feign and flatter me.
Ayd the Revenge of an unhappy Wife,
And make him lead a wretched Husbands Life.





Let him come near thee, Syren, if he can;
Thy Slavery shall have so short a chain,
I'le keep my aking Fore-head from that pain.





In all the Cheats I used, the tricks I plaid,
And all the Credulous Fools I have betray'd,
Free from all hainous Crimes I safely slept:
My Virgin Chastity entire I kept.
Did I preserve my Innocence for this?
A Maid! dull Slave, I am too good for thee.
A Curse upon my Idle Honesty.





Can she be honest then at last? If this
Be true, ye Gods, I ask no greater Bliss.





Your Confirmation of our Loves has given
Me all the joys I wish on this side Heav'n.





But Sylvio see you Love me as you shou'd,
And slight me not for want of Heav'nly blood.
But, Sir, if Love to Gods Allied can be,

I am as near of Kin to Heav'n as she.







Welcome to Life, and to thy Fathers Arms:

I am all joy: My Youth ne're felt such Charms.

  66Here take her, Sir, and may you happy live. 
to Mirt.

This day has all the longest Life could give.














That Sylvio shot, brought me my Sylvio's heart:
Through the dear Wound his Soul came fluttering in:
He'l Love, and Love, and never Hate agen.
But you have been unk•…nd.











I should not think of Love, Heav'n knows how long,
Till seaven years hence. But you were in the wrong;
My Sylvio finds no fault that I'm too Young.





Now my dear Children, share your F•…thers heart;
Love has this day play'd its Triumphant part.
But, Cynthia, all these Blessings spring from Thee;
Faith, Innocence, Truth, Justice, Constancy,
And every Grace that humane Breast inspires,
Is but a spark of the Celestial fires.





All other Vertues may be taught a hove;
But ye great Gods look down, and learn to Love.
