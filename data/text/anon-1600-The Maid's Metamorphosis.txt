PHylander and Orestes what conceit 
trouble your silent mind let i entreat 
since we be come thus far as we do walk 
you will devise some pretty pleasant talk 
the air be cool the evening high and fair 
why shall your cloudy look then show despair 

believe i fair Eurimine my skill 
be simple in discourse and utterance ill 
Orestes if he be dispose to try 
can better manage such affair than I 

why then Orestes let i crave of you 
some old or late do story to renew 
another time you shall request of i 
as good if not a great courtesy 

trust i as now nor can I show a reason 
all mirth unto my mind come out of season 
for inward I be trouble in such sort 
as all unfit I be to make report 
of any thing may breed the least delight 
rather in tear I wish the day be night 
for neither can myself be merry now 
nor treat of aught that may be like of you 

that be but your melancholic old disease 
that never be dispose but when you please 

nay mistress then since he deny the task 
myself will straight accomplish what you ask 
and though the pleasure in my tale be small 
yet may it serve to pass the time withal 

thank good Phylander when you please say on 
better I deem a bad discourse than none 

sometime there live a duke not far from hence 
mighty in fame and virtue excellence 
subject he have as ready to obey 
as he to rule belove every way 
but that which most of all he glory in 
hope of his age and comfort of his kin 
be the fruition of one only son 
a gallant youth inferior unto none 
for virtue shape or excellence of wit 
that after he upon his throne may sit 
this youth when once he come to perfect age 
the duke will fain have link in marriage 
with diverse dame of honourable blood 
but still his father purpose he withstand 

how be he not of metal apt to love 

yes apt enough as will the sequel prove 
but so the stream of his affection lie 
as he do lean a quite contrary way 
disprove still the choice his father make 
and oftentimes the matter have delay 
now give hope he will at length consent 
and then again excuse his intent 

what make he so repugnant in his deed 

another love which this disorder breed 
for even at home within his father court 
the saint be shrine who he do honour most 
a lovely dame a virgin pure and chaste 
and worthy of a prince to be embrace 
have but her birth which be obscure they say 
answer her beauty this their opinion stay 
yet do this wilful youth affect she still 
and none but she be mistress of his will 
full often do his father he dissuade 
from like such a mean and low bear maid 
the more his father strive to change his mind 
the more the son become with fancy blind 

Alas how speed the silly lover then 

as may even grieve the rude uncivil man 
when hereupon to wean his fix heart 
from such dishonour to his high desert 
the duke have labour but in vain do strive 
thus he begin his purpose to contrive 
two of his servant of undoubted troth 
he bind by virtue of a solemn oath 
to train the silly damsel out of sight 
and there in secret to bereave she quite 

of what her life 

yes madam of her life 
which be the cause of all the former strife 

and do they kill she 

you shall hear anon 
the question first must be decide on 
in your opinion what be your judgement say 
who be most cruel those that do obey 
or he that give commandment for the fact 

in each of they it be a bloody act 
yet they deserve to speak my mind of both 
Most pardon that be bind thereto by oath 

it be enough we do accept your doom 
to pass unblamed whatever of you become 

to pass unblamed whatever become of i 
what may the meaning of these speech be 

Eurymine my tremble tongue do sail 
my conscience irk my faint sense quail 
my falter speech bewray my guilty thought 
and stammer at the message we have bring 

ay i what horror do invade my breast 

nay then Phylander I will tell the rest 
damsel thus fare thy case demand not why 
you must forth with prepare yourself to die 
therefore dispatch and set your mind at rest 

Phylander be it true or do he jest 

there be no remedy but you must die 
by you I frame my tragic history 
the duke my master be the man I mean 
his son the prince the maid of mean descent 
yourself on who Ascanio so do dote 
as for no reason may remove his thought 
your death the duke determine by we two 
to end the love betwixt his son and you 
and for that cause we train you to this wood 
where you must sacrifice your dear blood 

respect my tear 

we must regard our oath 

my tender year 

they be but trifle both 

my innocency 

that will our promise break 
dispatch forthwith we may not hear you speak 

if neither tear nor innocency move 
yet think there be a heavenly power above 

a do and stand not preach here all day 

then since there be no remedy I pray 
yet good my master do but stay so long 
till I have take my farewell with a song 
of he who I shall never see again 

we will afford that respite to your pain 

but least the fear of death appall my mind 
sweet gentleman let i this favour find 
that you will vale my eyesight with this scarf 
that when the fatal stroke be aim at i 
I may not start but suffer patient 

agree give i I will shadow you from fear 
if this may do it 

o I will it may 
but shadow want the power to do that right 
you sacred fire and power above 
forge of desire work love 
cast down your eye cast down your eye 
upon a maid in misery 
my sacrifice be lover blood 
and from eye salt tear a flood 
all which I spend all which I spend 
for thou Ascanio my dear friend 
and though this hour I must feel 
the bitter sour of prick steel 
yet ill or well yet ill or well 
to thou Ascanio still farewell 

what mean Phylander 

o forbear thy stroke 
her piteous moan and gesture may provoke 
hard flint to ruth 

have thou forget thy oath 

forget it no 

then wherefore do thou interrupt i so 

a sudden terror overcome my thought 

then suffer i that stand in fear of nought 

o hold Orestes hear my reason first 

be all religion of thy vow forget 
do as thou will but I forget it not 

Orestes if thou stand upon thy oath 
let i alone to answer for we both 

what answer can thou give I will not stay 

nay villain than my sword shall make i way 

will thou in this against thy conscience strive 

I will defend a woman while I live 
a virgin and a innocent beside 
therefore put up or else thy chance abide 

I will never sheathe my sword unless thou show 
our oath reserve we may let she go 

that will I do if truth may be of force 

and then will I be please to grant remorse 

little think and when out of door I go 
that thus my life shall stand on argument 

a lawful oath in a unlawful cause 
be first dispense withal by reason law 
then next respect must to the end be have 
because the intent do make it good or bad 
now here the intent be murder as thou see 
which to perform thou on thy oath rely 
but since the cause be wicked and unjust 
the effect must likewise be hold odious 
we swear to kill and God forbid to kill 
shall we be rule by he or by man will 
beside it be a woman be condemn 
and what be he that be a man indeed 
that can endure to see a woman bleed 

thou have prevail Eurymine stand up 
I will not touch thou for a world of gold 

why now thou seem to be of humane mould 
but on our grant fair maid that you shall live 
will you to we your faithful promise give 
henceforth to abandon this your country quite 
and never more return into the sight 
of fierce Telemachus the angry duke 
whereby we may be void of all rebuke 

here do I plight my chaste unspotted hand 
I will abjure this most accurse land 
and vow henceforth what fortune ere betide 
within these wood and desert to abide 

now want there nothing but a fit excuse 
to soothe the duke in his conceive abuse 
that he may be persuade she be slay 
and we our wont favour still maintain 

it shall be thus within a lawn hard by 
obscure with bush where no humane eye 
can any way discover our deceit 
there feed a herd of goat and country neat 
some kid or other young ling will we take 
and with our sword dispatch it for her sake 
and have slay it rip his pant breast 
and take the heart of the unguilty beast 
which to the intent our counterfeit report 
may seem more likely we will bear to court 
and there protest with bloody weapon draw 
it be her heart 

then likewise take this lawn 
which well Telemachus do know she wear 
and let it be all spot too with gore 
How say you mistress will you spare that vale 

that or what else to verify your tale 
and thank Phylander and Orestes both 
that you preserve i from a tyrant wroth 

I will it be within my power I wis 
to do you great courtesy than this 
but what we can by our deed express 
in heart we wish to ease your heaviness 

a double debt yet one word ere you go 
commend i to my dear Ascanio 
who loyal love and presence to forgo 
do gall i more than all my other woe 

our life shall never want to do he good 

nor yet our death if he in danger stand 
and mistress so good fortune be your guide 

and aught that may be fortunate beside 

the like I wish unto yourselves again 
and many happy day devoid of pain 
and now Eurymine record thy state 
so much deject and oppress by fate 
what hope remain wherein have thou to joy 
wherein to triumph but thy own annoy 
if ever wretch may tell of misery 
than I alas poor I be only she 
unknown of parent destitute of friend 
hopeful of nought but what misfortune send 
banish to live a fugitive alone 
in uncouth path and region never know 
behold Ascanio for thy only sake 
these tedious travel I must undertake 
nor do I grudge the pain seem less to i 
in that I suffer this distress for thou 

well meet fair nymph or goddess if you be 
it be strange methinks that one of your degree 
shall walk these solitary grove alone 

it be no marvel if you know my moan 
but what be you that question i so far 

my habit tell you that a forester 
that have lose a herd of skittish deer 
be of good hope I shall have find they here 

trust i I see not any so farewell 

nay stay and further of your fortune tell 
I be not one that mean you any harm 

I think my boy be flee away by charm 
ranger well meet within thy walk I pray 
see thou not Moyso my unhappy boy 

shepherd not I what mean to seek he here 

because the wag possess with doubtful fear 
lest I will beat he for a fault he do 
among those tree I do suspect he be hide 
but how now ranger you mistake I trow 
this be a lady and no barren dow 

it be indeed and as it seem distress 
who grief to know I humble make request 
but she as yet will not reveal the same 

perhaps to i she will speak gentle dame 
what danger great have drive you to this place 
make know your state and look what slender grace 
a shepherd poor ability may yield 
you shall be sure of ere I leave the field 

alas good sir the cause may not be know 
that have enforce i to be here alone 

nay fear not to discover what you be 
it may be we may remedy your care 

since needs you will that I renew my grief 
whether it be my chance to find relief 
or not I wreak not such my cross be 
as soon I expect to meet despair 
then thus it be not far from hence do dwell 
my parent of the world esteem well 
who with their bitter threat my grant have win 
this day to marry with a neighbour son 
and such a one to who I shall be wife 
as I can never fancy in my life 
and therefore to avoid that endless thrall 
this morn I come away and leave they all 

now trust i virgin they be much unkind 
to seek to match you so against your mind 

it be beside unnatural constraint 
but by the tenure of your just complaint 
it seem you be not mind to return 
nor any more to dwell where you be bear 

it be my purpose if I may obtain 
a place of refuge where I may remain 

why go with i my lodge be not far off 
where you shall have such hospitality 
as shall be for your health and safety 

soft ranger you do range beyond your skill 
my house be near and for my good will 
it shall exceed a woodman wooden stuff 
then go with i I will keep you safe enough 

I will bring she to a bower beset with green 

and I a arbour may delight a queen 

her diet shall be venison at my board 

young kid and lamb we shepherd can afford 

and nothing else 

yes range now and then 
a hog a goose a capon or a hen 

these walk be i among the shady tree 

for that I have a garden full of bee 
who buzz music with the flower sweet 
each even and morning shall her sense greet 

the nightingale be my continual clock 

and i the watchful sinremembring cock 

a hunt be up I can tune she with my hound 

and I can show her mead and fruitful ground 

within these wood be many pleasant spring 

betwixt yond dale the echo daily sing 

I marvel that a rustic shepherd dare 
with woodman then audacious compare 
why hunt be a pleasure for a king 
and god themselves sometime frequent the thing 
Diana with her bow and arrow keen 
do often use the chase in forest green 
and so alas the good athenian knight 
and swift Actaeon herein take delight 
and Atalanta the arcadian dame 
conceive such wondrous pleasure in the game 
that with her train of nymph attend on 
she come to hunt the boar of Calydon 

so do Apollo walk with shepherd crook 
and many king their sceptre have forsake 
to lead the quiet life we shepherd take 
account it a refuge for their woe 

but we take choice of many a pleasant walk 
and mark the deer how they begin to stalk 
when each accord to his age and time 
prick up his head and bear a princely mind 
the lusty stag conductor of the train 
lead all the herd in order down the plain 
the base rascal scatter here and there 
as not presume to approach so near 

so shepherd sometime sit upon a hill 
or in the cool shadow of a mill 
and as we sit unto our pipe we sing 
and therewith make the neighbour grove to ring 
and when the sun steal downward to the west 
we leave our chat and whistle in the fist 
which be a signal to our straggle flock 
as trumpet sound to man in martial shock 

shall I be thus outface by a swain 
I will have a guard to wait upon her train 
of gallant woodman clad in comely green 
the like whereof have seldom yet be see 

and I of shepherd such a lusty crew 
as never forester the like yet know 
who for their person and their neat array 
shall be as fresh as be the month of May 
where be you there you merry note swain 
draw near a while and while upon the plain 
your flock do gentle feed let we see your skill 
how you with chant can sad sorrow kill 

think gemulo to bear the bell away 
by sing of a simple roundelay 
no I have fellow who melodious throat 
shall even as far exceed those homely note 
as do the nightingale in music pass 
the most melodious bird that ever be 
and for a instance here they be at hand 
when they have do let our desert be scan 

thank to you both you both deserve so well 
as I want skill your worthiness to tell 
and both I do commend for your good will 
and both I will honour love and reverence still 
for never virgin have such kindness show 
of stranger yea and man to her unknown 
but more to end this sudden controversy 
since I be make a umpire in the plea 
this be my verdict I will entreat of you 
a cottage for my dwell and of you 
a flock to tend and so indifferent 
my grateful pain on either shall be spend 

I be agree and for the love I bear 
I will boast I have a tenant be so fair 

and I will hold it as a rich possession 
that she vouchsafe to be of my profession 

then for a sign that no man here have wrong 
from hence let we all conduct she with a song 

away joculo 

here sir at hand 

joculo where be she 

I know not 

when go she 

I know not 

which way go she

when shall I find she 

I know not 

a vengeance take thou slave what do thou know 

marry sir that I do know 

what villain 

and you be so testy go look 
what a coil here with you 
if we know where she be what need we seek she 
I think you be lunatic where be you

from my lip to sustain that hungry maw 
of your misery there be such a dearth at this time 
God amend it 

a joculo my breast be full of grief 
and yet my hope that only want relief 

your breast and my belly be in two contrary key 
you walk to get stomach to your meat 
and I walk to get meat to my stomach 
your breast be full and my belly be empty 
if they chance to part in this case God send they 
merry meeting that my belly be full and your breast empty 

boy for the love that ever thou do owe 
to thy dear master poor Ascanio 
rack thy prove wit unto the high strain 
to bring i back Eurymine again 

nay master if wit can do it I can tell you 
more but if it ever be do the very legerity 
of the foot must do it these ten nimble bone 
must do the deed I will trot like a little dog 
there be not a bush so big as my beard 
but I will be peep in it there be not a coat but 
I will search every corner if she be above or 
beneath over the ground or under I will find she out 

stay joculo alas it can be 
if we shall part I lose both she and thou 
the wood be wide and wander thus about 
thou may be lose and not my love find out 

I pray you let i go 

I pray thou stay 

i'faith I will run 

and do not know which way 

any way all be one I will draw dry foot 
if you send not to seek she you may lie 
here long enough before she come to seek you 
she little think that you be hunt for she 
in these quarter 

ah joculo before I leave my boy 
of this world comfort now my only joy 
see thou this place upon this grassy bed 
with summer gawdy diaper bespread 
under these shadow shall my dwelling be 
till thou return sweet joculo to i 

and if my convoy be not cut off by the way 
it shall not be long before I be with you 
well I pray you look to my master for 
here I leave he among you and if I 
chance to light on the wench you shall hear 
of i by the next wind 

in vain I fear I beat my brain about 
prove by search to find my mistress out 
Eurymine Eurymine return 
and with thy presence guild the beauteous morn 
and yet I fear to call upon thy name 
the prattle echo shall she learn the same 
the last word accent she will not more prolong 
but bear that sound upon her airy tongue 
adorn with the presence of my love 
the wood I fear such secret power shall prove 
as they will shut up each path hide every way 
because they still will have she go astray 
and in that place will always have her scene 
only because they will be ever green 
and keep the winged chorister still there 
to banish winter clean out of the year 
but why persist I to bemoan my state 
when she be go and my complaint too late 
a drowsy dulness close up my sight 
oh powerful sleep I yield unto thy might 

Come hither Iris 

Iris be at hand 
to attend jove wife great Juno high command 

Iris I know I do thy service prove 
and ever since I be the wife of jove 
thou have be ready when I call still 
and always most obedient to my will

her dove and swan and sparrow must be grace 
and on love altar must be high place 
my starry peacock which do bear my state 
scarce allow within his palace gate 
and since herself she thus prefer do see

and practise her wanton prank to play 
with this Ascanio and Eurymine 
but love shall know in spite of all his skill 
Juno be a woman and will have her will 

what be my goddess will may Iris ask 

Iris on thou I do impose this task 
to cross proud Venus and her purblind lad 
until the mother and her brat be mad 
and with each other set they so at odds 
till to their tooth they curse and ban the god 

God the grant consist alone in you 

then mark the course which now you must pursue 
within this overgrow forest there be find 
a dusky cave thrust low into the ground 
so ugly dark so dampy and steep 
as for his life the sun dare never peep 
into the entrance which do so affright 
the very day that half the world be night 
where fennish fog and vapour do abound 
there Morpheus do dwell within the ground 
no crow cock nor wake bell do call 
nor watchful dog disturb sleep at all 
no sound be hear in compass of the hill 
but every thing be quiet whisht and still 
amid this cave upon the ground do lie 
a hollow plancher all of ebony 
cover with black whereon the drowsy God 
drown in sleep continual do nod 
go Iris go and my commandment take 
and beat against the door till sleep awake 
bid he from i in vision to appear 
unto Ascanio that lie slumber here 
and in that vision to reveal the way 
how he may find the fair Eurymine

and his dark cabin bold will I shake 
until the drowsy lumpish God awake 
and such a bounce at his cave I will keep 
that if pale death seize on the eye of sleep 
I will rouse he up that when he shall i hear 
I will make his lock stand up on end with fear 
be silent air while Iris in her pride 
swift than thought upon the wind do ride 
what Somnus what Somnus somnus

and come present away 
or I will beat upon this door 
that after this thou sleep no more 

I will take a nap and come anon

follow the path that on thy right hand lie 
a age hermit thou by chance shall find 
that there have be time almost out of mind 
this holy man this age reverent father 
there in the wood do root and simples gather

and bring we both together at the last

my name be cricket 

I will I be a chimney for your sake 

I pray you you pretty little fellow what be your name 

my name be little little prick 

little little prick o you be a dangerous fairy 
and fright all the little wench in the country 
out of their bed 
I care not who hand I be in so I be out of you 

I do come about the cop 
leap upon flower top 
then I get upon a fly 
she carry i above the sky 
and trip and go 

when a dew drop fall down 
and do light upon my crown 
than I shake my head and skip 
and about I trip 

when I feel a girl asleep 
underneath her frock I peep 
there to sport and there I play 
than I bite she like a flea 
and about I skip 

ay I think where I shall have you 

will it please you dance fir 

Indeed sir I can handle my leg 

o you must needs dance and sing 
which if you refuse to do 
we will pinch you black and blue 
and about we go 

no no great Phoebus this your silence tend 
to hide your grief from knowledge of your friend 
who if they know the cause in each respect 
will show their utmost skill to cure the effect 

good lady your conceit in judgement err 
because you see i dumpish you refer 
the reason to some secret grief of i 
but you have see i melancholy many a time 
perhaps it be the glow weather now 
that make i seem so ill at ease to you 

fine shift to colour that you can hide 
no Phoebus by your look may be descry 
some hide conceit that harbour in your thought 
which have therein some strange impression wrought 
that by the course thereof you seem to i 
another man than you be wont to be 

no lady you deceive yourselves in i 
what likelihood or token do you see 
that may persuade it true that you suppose 

Apollo hence a great suspicion grow 
year not so pleasant now as erst in company 
you walk alone and wander solitary 
the pleasant toy we do frequent sometime 
be wear away and grow out of prime 
your instrument have lose his silver sound 
that ring of late through all this grovy ground 
your bow wherewith the chase you do frequent 
be close in case and long have be unbend 
How differ you from that Apollo now 
that whilom sit in shade of laurel bow 
and with the warble of your ivory lute 
to allure the fairy for to dance about 
or from the apollo that with bend bow 
do many a sharp and wound shaft bestow 
a midst the dragon pithon scaly wing 
and force his die blood to spout in spring 
believe i Phoebus who see you then and now 
will think there be a wondrous change in you 

alas fair dame to make my sorrow plain 
will but revive a ancient wound again 
which grate present upon my mind 
do leave a scar of former woe behind 

Phoebus if you account we for the same 
that tender thou and love Apollo name 
pour forth to we the fountain of your woe 
from whence the spring of these your sorrow slow 
if we may any way redress your moan 
command our best harm will we do you none 

good lady though I hope for no relief 
I will show the ground of this my present grief 
this time of year or there about it be 
accurse be the time ten time alas 
when I from Delphos take my journey down 
to see the game in noble Sparta town 
there see I that wherein I begin to joy 
Amilcar son a gallant comely boy 
hight hyacinth full fifteen year of age 
who I intend to have make my page 
and bear as great affection to the boy 
as ever jove in Ganymede do joy 
among the game myself put in a pledge 
to try my strength in throw of the sledge 
which poise with my strain arm I throw 
so far that it beyond the other slay 
my hyacinth delight in the game 
desire to prove his manhood in the same 
and catch ere the sledge lie still on ground 
with violent force aloft it do rebound 
against his head and batter out his brain 
and so alas my lovely boy be slay 

hard hap oh Phoebus but sith it be past and go 
we wish you to forbear this frustrate moan 

lady I know my sorrow be in vain 
and yet from mourning can I not refrain 

Eurania some pleasant song shall sing 
to put you from your dump 

Alas no song will bring 
the least relief to my perplex mind 

no Phoebus what other pastime shall we find 
to make you merry with 

fair dame I thank you all 
no sport nor pastime can release my thrall 
my grief be of course when it the course have have 
I shall be merry and no long sad 

what will you then we do 

and please you you may go 
and leave i here to seed upon my woe 

then Phoebus we can but wish you well again 

I thank you gentle lady for your pain 
o Phoebus wretched thou thus be thou fain 
with forge excuse to conceal thy pain 
o hyacinth I suffer not these fit 
for thou my boy no no another sit 
deep than thou in closet of my breast 
who sight so late have wrought i this unrest 
and yet no goddess nor of heavenly kind 
she be who beauty thus torment my mind 
no fairy nymph that haunt these pleasant wood 
no goddess of the flower the field nor flood 
yet such a one who just I may call 
a nymph as well as any of they all 
Eurymine what heaven afford thou here 
so may I say because thou come so near 
and near far unto a heavenly shape 
than she of who jove triumph in the rape 
I will sit i down and wake my grief again 
to sing a while in honour of thy name 

although there be such difference in the change 
to live in court and desert wood to range 
yet in extreme wherein we can choose 
a extreme refuge be not to refuse 
good gentleman do any see my herd 
I shall not find they out I be afeard 
and yet my master wait with his bow 
within a stand for to strike a doe 
you see they not your silence make i doubt 
I must go further till I find they out 

what seek you pretty maid 

forsooth my herd of deer 

I see they late but they be not here

a hour ago or twain 
I see they feed all above the plain 

so much the more my toil to fetch they in 
I thank you sir 

nay stay sweet nymph with i 

my business can so dispatch be 

but pray you maid it will be very good 
to take the shade in this unhaunted wood 
this flower bay with branch large and great 
will shroud you safe from the parch heat 

good sir my business call i hence in haste 

o stay with he who conquer thou have 
with he who restless thought do beat on thou 
with he that joy thy wish face to see 
with he who joy surmount all joy above 
if thou will think he worthy of thy love 

why sir will you desire another make 
and wear that garland for your mistress sake 

no nymph although I love this laurel tree 
my fancy ten time more affect thou 
and as the bay be always fresh and green 
so shall my love as fresh to thou be see 

now true sir you offer i great wrong 
to hold i from my business here so long 

o stay sweet nymph with more advisement view 
what one he be that for thy grace do sue 
I be not one that haunt on hill or rock 
I be no shepherd wait on my flock 
I be no boisterous satire no nor Faun 
that be with pleasure of thy beauty draw 
thou do not know God wot thou do not know 
the wight who presence thou disdain so 

but I may know if you will please to tell 

my father in the high heaven do dwell 
and I be know the son of jove to be 
whereon the folk of Delphos honour i 
by i be know what be what be and what shall be 
by i be learn the rule of harmony 
by i the depth of physics lore be find 
and power of herb that grow upon the ground 
and thus by circumstance may thou see 
that I be Phoebus who do fancy thou 

no sir by these discourse may I see 
you mock i with a forge pedigree 
if son you be to jove as erst you say 
in make love unto a mortal maid 
you work dishonour to your deity 
I must be go I thank you for your courtesy 

Alas abandon not thy lover so 

I pray sir hearty give i leave to go 

the way overgrow with shrub and bush thick 
the sharpen thorn your tender foot will prick 
the bramble round about your train will lap 
the burr and brier about your skirt will wrap 

if Phoebus thou of jove the offspring be 
dishonour not thy deity so much 
with proffer force a silly maid to touch 
for do so although a god thou be 
the earth and man on earth shall ring thy infamy 

hard speech to he that love thou so well 

what know I that 

I know it and can tell and feel it too 

if that your love be such 
as you pretend so fervent and so much 
for proof thereof grant i but one request 

I will by jove my father I protest 
provide first that thy petition be 
not hurtful to thyself nor harm to i 
for so sometime do Phaeton my son 
request a thing whereby he be undo 
he lose his life through crave it and I 
through grant it lose he my son thereby 

then Phoebus thus it be if thou be he 
that be pretend in thy pedigree 
if son thou be to jove as thou do feign 
and challenge that title not in vain 
now here bewray some sign of godhead then 
and change i straight from shape of maid to man 

Alas what fond desire do move thy mind 
to wish thou alter from thy native kind 
if thou in this thy woman form can move 
not man but god to sue and seek thy love 
content thyself with nature bounty than 
and covet not to bear the shape of man 
and this moreover will I say to thou 
fair man than may be thou shall never be 

these vain excuse manifest show 
whether you usurp Apollo name or no 
sith my demand so far surmount your art 
you join exception on the other part 

nay then my doubtless deity to prove 
although thereby for ever I lose my love 
I grant thy wish thou be become a man 
I speak no more than well perform I can 
and though thou walk in change body now 
this penance shall be add to thy vow 
thyself a man shall love a man in vain 
and love wish to be a maid again 

Apollo whether I love a man or not 
I thank you now I will accept my lot 
and sith my change have disappoint you 
you be at liberty to love anew 

if ever I love sith now I be forsake 
where next I love it shall be better take 
but whatsoever my fate in love be 
yet thou may vaunt that Phoebus love thou 

joculo whither jet thou 
have thou find thy master

Come a treble conjunction all three all three 

but Frisco have not find the fair shepherdess thy master mistress

Priapus quoth he what in a God may that be 

a plain God with a good peg to hang a shepherdess bottle upon

my master swear by Silvanus I must swear by his poor neighbour 

and here be a shepherd swain swear by a kitchen God pan 

Pan the shepherd god but thou swear by pot what God that 

the god of goodfellowship well you have wicked master that teach such little boy as you be to swear so young

I never hear he swear six sound oath in all my life 

May hap he can because he be disease

faith and I be founder with fling too and fro with chestnut hazelnut bullace and wilding for present from my master to the fair shepherdess 

and I be tire like a calf with carry a kid every week to the cottage of my master sweet lambkin

give i leave be not we fool to wear our young foot to old stump when there dwell a cunning man in a cave hereby who for a bunch of root a bag of nut or a bushel of crab will tell we where thou shall find thy master and which of our master shall win the wench favour 

bring i to he frisco I will give he all the point at my hose to point i right to my master 

a bottle of whey shall be his meed if he save i labour for post with present 

here he come offend he not joculo 
for fear he turn thou to a Jack a ape 

and thou to a owl 

and thou to a woodcock

good speed good man 

welcome bad boy

I speak and mean not he nor he nor thou 
but speak so I speak and mean all three 

if you be good at rhyme and riddle old man expound i this 
these two serve two those two serve one 
assoil i this and I be go 

you three serve three those three do seek to one 
one shall she find he come and she be go

for if she have never go he have never come 

good master wizard leave these murlemewes and tell Mopso plain whether gemulo my master that gentle shepherd shall win the love of the fair shepherdess his flock keeper or not and I will give you a bottle of as good whey as ere you lay lip too 

and good father fortune teller let Frisco know whither Silvio my master that lusty forester shall gain that same gay shepherdess or no I will promise you nothing for your pain but a bag full of nut if I bring a crab or two in my pocket take they for advantage 

and gentle master wiseman tell joculo if his noble master Ascanio that gallant courtier shall be find by i and she find by he for who he have lose his father favour and his own liberty and I my labour and I will give you thanks for we courtier neither give nor take bribe 

I take your meaning better than your speech 
and I will grant the thing you do beseech 
but for the tear of lover be no toy 
I will tell their chance in parable to boy 

in what you will let we hear our master luck 

thy master do shall turn unto a buck 
thy master ewe be change to a ram 
thy master seek a maid and find a man 
yet for his labour shall he gain his meed 
the other two shall sigh to see he speed 

then my master shall not win the shepherdess 

no haste thou home and bid he right his wrong 
the shepherdess will leave his flock ere long 

I will run to warn my master of that 

my master woodman take but wooden pain to no purpose I think what say you shall he speed 

no tell he so and bid he tend his deer 
and cease to woe he shall not wed this year 

I be not sorry for it farewell joculo 

I may go with thou for I shall speed even so too by stay behind 

better my boy thou shall thy master find 
and he shall find the party he require 
and yet not find the sum of his desire 
Keep on that way thy master walk before 
who when thou find lose he good boy no more 

shall then my travel ever endless prove 
that I can hear no tiding of my love 
in neither desert grove nor shady wood 
nor obscure thicket where my foot have tread 
but every ploughman and rude shepherd swain 
do still reply unto my great pain 
some satire then or goddess of this place 
some water nymph vouchsafe i so much grace 
as by some view some sign or other sho 
I may have knowledge if she live or no 

no 

then my poor heart be bury too in woe 
record it once more if the truth be so 

So 

how that Eurymine be dead or life 

live 

now gentle goddess thou redeem my soul 
from death to life o tell i quick where 

where 

in some remote far region or else near 

near 

o what conceal she from my thirsty eye 
be it restraint or some unknown disguise 

disguise 

let i be hang my lord but all be lie 

lie 

true we be both persuade thou do lie 

thou do lie 

who I 

who I 

i thou 

i thou 

thou dare not come and say so to my face 

thy face 

I will make you then for ever prate more 

more 

will you prate more I will see that present 

stay joculo it be the echo boy 
that mock our grief and laugh at our annoy 
hard by this grove there be a goodly plain 
betwixt two hill still fresh with drop of rain 
where never spread oak nor poplar grow 
may hinder the prospect or other view 
but all the country that about it lie 
present itself unto our mortal eye 
save that upon each hill by leafy tree 
the sun at high his scorch heat may lose 
there languish myself I will betake 
as heaven shall please and only for her sake 

stay master I have spy the fellow now that mock 
we all this while see where he sit 

the very shape my vision tell i off 
that I shall meet with as I stray this way 

what line he draw best go not over far 

let i alone thou do but trouble i 

you will trouble we all anon you shall see 

God speed fair sir 

my lord do you not mark 
how the sky thicken and begin to dark 

health to you sir 

nay then God be our speed 

forgive i sir I see you not indeed 

pardon i rather for molest you 

such another face I never know 

thus studious I be wont to pass the time 
by true proportion of each line from line 

o now I see he be learn to spell 
there be A B C in midst of his table 

tell i I pray you sir may I be bold to crave 
the cause of your abode within this cave 

to tell you that in this extreme distress 
be but a tale of fortune fickleness 
sometime I be a prince of Lesbos I will 
and live belove while my good star do smile 
but cloud once with this world bitter cross 
my joy to grief my gain convert to loss 

forward I pray you faint not in your tale 

it will not all be worth a cup of ale 

a short discourse of that which be too long 
however please can never seem but wrong 
yet will my tragic story fit the stage 
pleasant in youth but wretched in my age 
blind fortune set up and pull down 
abuse by those myself raise to renown 
but that which wring i near and wound my heart 
be a false brother base unthankful part 

a small offence compare with my disease 
no doubt ingratitude in time may cease 
and be forget my grief outlive all hour 
rain on my head continual hapless shower 

you sing of you and I of i relate 
to every one seem worst his own estate 
but to proceed exile thus by spite 
both country I forgo and brother sight 
and come hither where I think to live 
yet here I can but lament and grieve 

some comfort yet in this there do remain 
that you have find a partner in your pain 

how be your sorrow subject let i hear 

More overthrow and deep in despair 
than be the manner of your heavy smart 
my cureless grief do rankle at my heart 
and in a word to hear the sum of all 
I love and be belove but therewithal 
the sweetness of that banquet must forgo 
who pleasant taste be change with bitter woe 

a conflict but to try your noble mind 
as common unto youth as rain to wind 

but hence it it that do i treble wrong 
expect good that be forbear so long 
do lose the virtue which the use will prove 

be you then sir despise of your love 

no but deprive of her company 
and for my careless negligence therein 
be bind to do this penance for my sin 
that if I never find where she remain 
I vow a year shall be my end of pain 

be she then lose within this forest here 

lose or forlorn to i she be right dear 
and this be certain unto he that can 
the place where she abide to i unfold 
for ever I will vow myself his friend 
never revolt till my life do end 
and therefore sir as well I know your skill 
if you will give i physic for this ill 
and show i if Eurymine do live 
it be a recompense for all my pain 
and I shall think my joy be full again 

they know the want of health that have be sick 
myself sometime acquaint with the like 
do learn in duty of a kind regard 
to pity he who hap have be so hard 
how long I pray you have she absent be 

three day it be since that my love be see 

here be learning for the nonce that stand on joint 
for all his cunning I will scarce give two point 

Mercurio regnante virum subsequent Luna faeminum designat 

nay and you go to latin then it be sure my master shall find she if he can tell when 

I can tell what reason it shall be 
but love and reason here do disagree 
by proof of learned principle I find 
the manner of your love be against all kind 
and not to feed you with uncertain joy 
who you affect so much be but a boy 

a riddle for my life some antic jest 
do I not tell you what his cunning be 

I love a boy 

my art do tell i so 

add not a fresh increase unto my woe 

I dare avouch what late I have say 
the love that trouble you be for no maid 

as well I may be say to touch the sky 
or dark the horizon with tapestry 
or walk upon the water of the sea 
as to be haunt with such lunacy 

if it be false my art I will defy 

amaze with grief my love be then transform 

master be content this be leap year 
woman wear breeches petticoat be dear 
and that be his meaning on my life it be 

o God and shall my torment never cease 

repress the fury of your trouble mind 
walk here a while your lady you may find 

a lady and a boy this hang well together 
like snow in harvest sunshine and foul weather 
since hope of help my froward star deny 
come sweet death and end my misery 
he leave his country I my shape have lose 
dear be the love that have so dear cost 

yet can I boast though Phoebus be unjust 
this shift do serve to bar he from his lust 
but who be these alone I can choose 
but blush for shame that any one shall see 
Eurymine in this disguise to be 

it be it be not my love Eurymine 

hark some one hallow gentleman adieu 
in this attire I dare not stay their view 

my love my joy my life 
by eye by face by tongue it shall be she 
o ay it be my love I will after she 
and though she pass the eagle in her flight 
I will never rest till I have gain her sight 

love carry he and so retain his mind 
that he forget how I be leave behind 
yet will I follow soft as I can 
in hope to see the fortune of the man 

nay let they go a god name one by one 
with my heart I be glad to be alone 
here be old transform will with all his art 
he can transform this tree into a tart 
see then if I will flinch from hence or no 
but for it be not so I needs must go 

be it a bargain gemulo or not 

thou never know i break my word I wot 
nor will I now betide i bale or bliss 

nor I break my and here her cottage be 
I will call she forth 

will Silvio be so rude 

never shall we betwixt ourselves conclude 
our controversy for we over ween 

not I but thou for though thou jet in green 
as fresh as meadow in a morn of May 
and scorn the shepherd for he go in grey 
but forester believe it as thy creed 
my mistress mind my person not my weed 

so it be I think because she tend thy sheep 
thou think in love of thou she take keep 
that be as townish damsel send the hand 
but send the heart to he a loose do stand 
So deal Eurymine with Siluto 

albeit she look more blithe on gemulo 
her heart be in the dial of her eye 
that point i here 

that shall we quick try 
Eurymine 

Erynnis stop thy throat 
unto thy hound thou hallow such a note 
I think that shepherd have be mannerless 
but woodman be the rude groom I guess 

how shall I call her swain but by her name 

so Hobinoll the ploughman call his dame 
call she in carol from her quiet coat 

agree but whether shall begin his note 

draw cut 

content the long shall begin 

it be i 

sing loud for she be far within 

instruct thy sing in thy forest way 
shepherd know how to chant their roundelay 

repeat our bargain ere we sing our song 
lest after wrangle shall our mistress wrong 
if i she choose thou must be well content 
if thou she choose I give the like consent 

it be do now pan pipe on thy sweet reed 
and as I love so let thy servant speed 
as little lamb lift up their snowy side 
when mount lark salute the grayeyed morn 

as from the oaken leaf the honey glide 
where nightingale record upon the thorn 

so rise my thought 

so all my sense cheer 

when she survey my flock 

and she my dear 

Eurymine 

Eurymine 

Come forth 

Come forth 

Come forth and cheer these plain 

the woodmans love 

and lady of the swain 

fair forester and lovely shepherd swain 
your carol call Eurymine in vain 
for she be go her cottage and her sheep 
with i her brother have she leave to keep 
and make i swear by pan ere she do go 
to see they safe keep for gemulo 

what have my love a new come lover than 

what have my mistress get another man 

this swain will rob i of Eurymine 

this youth have power to win Eurymine 

this stranger beauty bear away my prize 

this stranger will bewitch she with his eye 

it be Adonis 

it be Ganymede 

my blood be chill 

my heart be cold as lead 

fair youth you have forget for what you come 
you seek your love she be go 

the more too blame 

not so my sister have no will to go 
but that our parent dread command be so 

it be thy excuse thou be not of her kin 
but as my rival come my love to win 

by great Apollo sacred deity 
that shepherdess so near be Sib to i 
as I ne may for all this world she wed 
for she and I in ownself womb be breed 
but she be go her flock be leave to i 

the shepcoat be mine and I will in and see 

and I

my manly shape have yet a woman mind 
prone to reveal what secret she do know 
God pardon i I be about to show 
my transformation peace they come again 

have you find she 

no we look in vain 

I tell you so 

yet hear i newcome swain 
albeit thy seemly feature set no sale 
but honest truth upon thy novel tale 
yet for this world be full of subtlety 
we wish thou go with we for company 
unto a wiseman wone in this wood 
hight Aramanth who wit and skill be good 
that he may certify our maze doubt 
how this strange chance and change have fall out 

I be content have with you when you will 

Even now 

he will make you muse if he have any skill 

Eurymine I pray if thou be she 
refrain thy haste and do not fly from i 
the time have be my word thou will allow 
and be I grow so loathsome to thou now 

Ascanio time have be I must confess 
when in thy presence be my happiness 
but now the manner of my misery 
have change that course that so it can be 

what wrong have I contrive what injury 
to alienate thy like so from i 
if thou be she who sometime thou do feign 
and bear not the name of friend in vain 
let not thy borrow guise of alter kind 
alter the wont like of thy mind 
but though in habit of a man thou go 
yet be the same Eurymine thou be 

how glad will I be thy lady still 
if earnest vow may answer to my will 

and be thy fancy alter with thy guise 

my kind but not my mind in any wise 

what though thy habit differ from thy kind 
thou may retain thy wont love mind 

and so I do 

then why be thou so strange 
or wherefore do thy plight fancy change 

Ascanio my heart do honour thou 

and yet continue still so strange to i 

not strange so far as kind will give i leave 

unkind that kind that kindness do bereave 
thou say thou love i 

as a friend his friend 
and so I vow to love thou to the end 

I wreak not of such love love i but so 
as fair Eurymine love Ascanio 

that love be deny unto my present kind 

in kind show unkind I do thou find 
I see thou be as constant as the wind 

do kind allow a man to love a man 

why be not thou Eurymine 

I be 

Eurymine my love 

the very same 

and be it not thou a woman then 

most true 

and be thou change from a woman now 

too true 

these tale my mind perplex thou be Eurymine 

in name but not in sex 

what then 

a man 

in guise thou be I see 

the guise thou see do with my kind agree 

before thy flight thou be a woman tho 

true Ascanio 

and since be thou a man 

too true dear friend 

then have I lose a wife 

but find a friend who dear blood and life 
shall be as ready as thy own for thou 
in place of wife such friend thou have of i 

I here they be master well overtake 
I think we two shall never meet again 
you go so fast that I to follow you 
slip over hedge and ditch and many a tall tree 

Well say my boy thou know not how to lie 

to lie sir how say you be it not so 
you be at my heel though far off you know 
for master not to counterfeit with you now 
he be as good a footman as a shackle sow 

good sir you be welcome sirrah hold your prate 

what speed in that I tell to you of late 

both good and bad as do the sequel prove 
for wretched I have find and lose my love 
if that be lose which I can never enjoy 

faith mistress you be too blame to be so coy 
the day have be but what be that to i 
when more familiar with a man you will be 

I tell you you shall find a man of she 
or else my rule do very strange err 

father the trial of your skill I find 
my love be transform into another kind 
and so I find and yet have lose my love 

you can tell take she aside and prove 

but sweet Eurymine make some report 
why thou depart from my father court 
and how this strange mishap to thou befall 
let i entreat thou will the process tell 

to show how I arrive in this ground 
be but renew of a ancient wound 
another time that office I will fulfil 
let it suffice I come against my will 
And wander here about this forest side 
it be my chance of Phoebus to be spy 
who love because I chaste do withstand 
he think to offer i a violent hand 
but for a present shift to shun his rape 
I wish myself transform into this shape 
which he perform God know against his will 
and I since then have wail my fortune still 
not for mislike aught I find in i 
but for thy sake who wife I mean to be 

thus have you hear our woeful destiny 
which I in heart lament and so do she 

the fit remedy that I can find 
be this to ease the torment of your mind 
persuade yourselves that great Apollo can 
as easy make a woman of a man 
as contrariwise he make a man of she 

I think no less 

then humble suit prefer 
to he perhaps your prayer may attain 
to have she turn into her form again 

but Phoebus such disdain to i do bear 
as hardly we shall win his grant I fear 

then in these verdant field all rich die 
with nature gift and Flora paint pride 
there be a goodly spring who crystal stream 
beset with myrtle keep back Phoebus beam 
there in rich seat all wrought of ivory 
the grace sit listen the melody 
the warble bird do from their pretty bill 
unite in concord as the brook distil 
who gentle murmur with his buzz note 
be as a base unto their hollow throat 
garland beside they wear upon their brow 
make of all sort of flower earth allow 
from whence such fragrant sweet perfume arise 
as you will swear that place be paradise 
to they let we repair with humble heart 
and meek show the manner of your smart 
so gracious be they in Apollo eye 
as their entreaty quick may suffice 
in your behalf I will tell they of your state 
and crave their aide to stand your advocate 

for ever you shall bind we to you then 

Come go with i I will do the best I can 

be not this hard luck to wander so long 
and in the end to find his wife mark wrong 

a proper jest as ever I hear tell 
in sooth methinks the breech become she well 
and may it not make their husband fear then 
will all the wife in our town may wear they 
tell i youth be a strange here or no 

be your commission sir to examine i so 

what be it thou now by my troth well meet 

by your leave it be well overtake yet 

I little think I shall have find thou here 

perhaps so sir 

I prithee speak what cheer 

what cheer can here be hopte for in these wood 
except tree stone briar bush or bud 

my meaning be I fain will hear thou say 
how thou do man why thou take this another way 

why then sir I do as well as I may 
and to persuade you that welcome you be 
will please you sir to eat a crab with i 

believe i joculo reasonable hard cheer 

Phylander it be the best we can get here 
but when return you to the court again 

short now I have find thou 

to requite your pain 
shall I entreat you bear a present from i 

to who 

to the duke 

what shall it be 

because venison so convenient do not fall 
a peck of acorn to make merry withal 

what mean thou by that 

by my troth sir as you see 
acorn be good enough for such as he 
I wish his honour well and to do he good 
will he have eat all the acorn in the wood 

good word joculo of your lord and i 

as may agree with such a churlish swine 
how do his honour 

indifferent well 

I wish he better 

how 

vicegerent in hell 

do thou wish so for aught that he have do 

I for the love he bear unto his son 

he be grow of late as fatherly and mild 
as ever father be unto his child 
and send i forth to search the coast about 
if so my hap may be to find he out 
and if Eurymine alive remain 
to bring they both unto the court again 
where be thy master 

walk about the ground 

o that his love Eurymine be find 

why so she be come follow i and see 
I will bring you straight where they remain be 

cease your contention for Eurymine 
nor word nor vow can help her misery 
but he it be that do she first transform 
must calm the gloomy rigor of this storm 
great Phoebus who palace we be near 
salute he then in his celestial sphere 
that with the note of cheerful harmony 
he may be move to show his deity 

but where be Eurymine have we lose her sight 

poor soul within a cave with fear affright 
she sit to shun Apollo angry view 
until she see what of our prayer ensue 
if we can reconcile his love or no 
or that she must continue in her woe 

once have we try Ascanio for thy sake 
and once again we will his power awake 
not doubt but as he be of heavenly race 
at length he will take pity on her case 
sing therefore and each party from his heart 
in this our music bear a cheerful part 

illustrate beauty crystal heaven eye 
once more we do entreat thy clemency 
that as thou be the power of we all 
thou will redeem Eurymine from thrall 
grant gentle God grant this our small request 
and if ability in we do rest 
whereby we ever may deserve the same 
it shall be see we reverence Phoebus name 

you sacred sister of fair hellion 
on who my favour evermore have shine 
in this you must have patience with my vow 
I can grant what you aspire unto 
nor be it my fault she be transform so 
but her own fond desire as you well know 
we tell she too before her vow be pass 
that cold repentance will ensue at last 
and sith herself do wish the shape of man 
she cause the abuse digest it how she can 

Alas if unto she you be so hard 
yet of Ascanio have some more regard 
and let he not endure such endless wrong 
that have pursue her constant love so long 

great God the grievous travel I have pass 
in restless search to find she out at last 
my plaint my toil in lieu of my annoy 
have well deserve my lady to enjoy 
penance too much I have sustain before 
o Phoebus plague i not with any more 
nor be thou so extreme now at the worst 
to make my torment great than at the first 
my father late displeasure be forget 
and there be no let nor any churlish blot 
to interrupt our joy from be complete 
but only thy good favour to entreat 
in thy great grace it lie to make my state 
most happy now or most infortunate 

heavenly Apollo on our knee I pray 
vouchsafe thy great displeasure to allay 
what honour to thy godhead will arise 
to plague a silly lady in this wise 
beside it be a stain unto thy deity 
to yield thy own desire the sovereignty 
then show some grace unto a woeful dame 
and in these grove our tongue shall sound thy fame 

arise dear nurse of divine skill 
you sacred muse of Parnassus hill 
Phoebus be conquer by your dear respect 
and will no long clemency neglect 
you have not sue nor pray to i in vain 
I grant your will she be a maid again 

thy praise shall never die while I do live 

nor will we slack perpetual thanks to give 

Thalia near the cave where she remain 
the fairy keep request they of their pain 
and in my name bid they forthwith provide 
from that dark place to be the lady guide 
and in the bounty of their liberal mind 
to give her clothes accord to her kind 

I go divine Apollo 

haste again 
no time too swift to ease a lover pain 

most sacred Phoebus endless thanks to thou 
that do vouchsafe so much to pity i 
and age father for your kindness show 
imagine not your friendship ill bestow 
the earth shall soon vanish and decay 
than I will prove unthankful any way 

it be sufficient recompense to i 
if that my silly help have pleasure you 
if you enjoy your love and heart desire 
it be enough nor do I more require 

grave Aramanthus now I see thy face 
I call to mind how tedious a long space 
thou have frequent these sad desert here 
thy time employ in heedful mind I bear 
the patient sufferance of thy former wrong 
thy poor estate and sharp exile so long

till wrong thou be with undeserved crime 
by they who thou to honour do advance 
the memory of which thy heavy chance 
provoke my mind to take remorse on thou 
father henceforth my client shall thou be 
and pass the remnant of thy fleet time 
with laurel wreath among the Muse nine 
and when thy age have give place to fate 
thou shall exchange thy former mortal state 
and after death a palm of fame shall wear 
among the rest that live in honour here 
and last know that fair Eurymine 
redeem now from former misery 
thy daughter be who I for that intent 
do hide from thou in this thy banishment 
that so she may the great scourge sustain 
in put Phoebus to so great a pain

that borrow name as Atlanta she be call 
and here she woman in her right shape instalde

and this thy love Atlanta now rejoice

and make report that when their wedding chance 
Phoebus give music and the Muse dance
