be patient madam you may have your pleasure 

it be that I come to town for I will not 
endure again the country conversation 
to be the lady of six shire the man 
so near the primitive make they retain 
a sense of nothing but the earth their brain 
and barren head stand as much in want 
of plough as their ground to hear a fellow 
make himself merry and his horse with whistle 
Sellinger round to observe with what solemnity 
they keep their wake and throw for pewter candlestick 
how they become the morris with which who bell 
they ring all into Whitsun ale and sweat 
through twenty scarf and napkin till the hobbyhorse 
tire and the maid marrian dissolve to a jelly 
be keep for spoon meat 

these with your pardon be no argument 
to make the country life appear so hateful 
at least to your particular who enjoy 
a blessing in that calm will you be please 
to think so and the pleasure of a kingdom 
while your own will command what shall move 
delight your husband love and power join 
to give your life more harmony you live there

all thy desire against my own opinion 
quit the country and remove the hope 
of our return by sale of that fair lordship

for this wild town compose of noise and charge 

what charge more than be necessary 
for a lady of my birth and education

in the state but with this lose not your memory 
of be my wife I shall be studious 
madam to give the dignity of your birth 
all the best ornament which become my fortune 
but will not flatter it to ruin both 
and be the fable of the town to teach 
other man loss of wit by i employ 
to serve your vast expense 

be I then 
bring in the balance so sir 

though you weigh 
i in a partial scale my heart be honest 
and must take liberty to think you have 
obey no modest counsel to effect 
nay study way of pride and costly ceremony 
your change of gaudy furniture and picture 
of this italian master and that Dutchman 
your mighty lookingglass like artillery 
bring who on engine the superfluous plate 
antic and novel vanity of tire 
fourscore pound supper for my lord your kinsman 
banquet for other lady aunt and cousin 
and perfume that exceed all train of servant 
to stifle we at home and show abroad 
more motley than the french or the venetian 
about your coach who rude postilion 
must pester every narrow lane till passenger 
and tradesman curse your choke up their stall 
and common cry pursue your ladyship 
for hinder of their market 

have you do sir 

I can accuse the gaiety of your wardrobe 
and prodigal embroidery under which 
rich satin plush cloth of silver dare 
not show their own complexion your jewel 
able to burn out the spectator eye 
and show like bonfire on you by the taper 
something may here be spare which safe of 
your birth and honour since the true wealth 
shine from the soul and draw up just admirer 
I can urge something more 

pray do I like 
your homily of thrift 

I can wish madam 
you will not game so much 

a gamester too 

but be not come to that repentance yet 
shall teach you skill enough to raise your profit 
you look not through the subtlety of card 
and mystery of dice nor can you save 
charge with the box buy petticoat and purl 
and keep your family by the precious income 
nor do I wish you shall my poor servant 
shall not upbraid my table nor his hire 
purchase beneath my honour you make play 
not a pastime but a tyranny and vex 
yourself and my estate by it 

good proceed 

another game you have which consume more 
your fame than purse your revel in the night 
your meeting call the ball to which appear 
as to the court of pleasure all your gallant 
and lady thither bind by a subpoena 
of Venus and small Cupid high displeasure 
it be but the family of love translate 
into more costly sin there be a play on it 
and have the poet not be bribe to a modest 
expression of your antic gambol in it 
some dark have be discover and the deed too 
in time he may repent and make some blush 
to see the second part dance on the stage 
my thought acquit you for dishonour i 
by any foul act but the virtuous know 
it be not enough to clear ourselves but the 
suspicion of our shame 

have you conclude 
your lecture 

I have do and howsoever 
my language may appear to you it carry 
no other than my fair and just intent 
to your delight without curb to their modest 
and noble freedom 

I will not be so tedious 
in my reply but without art or elegance 
assure you I keep still my first opinion 
and though you veil your avaricious meaning 
with handsome name of modesty and thrift 
I find you will entrench and wound the liberty 
I be bear with be my desire unprivileged 
by example while my judgement think they fit 
you ought not to oppose but when the practice 
and tract of every honourable lady 
authorize i I take it great injustice 
to have my pleasure circumscribe and teach i 
a narrow mind husband be a thief 
to his own fame and his preferment too 
he shut his part and fortune from the world 
while from the popular vote and knowledge man 
rise to employment in the state 

I have 
no great ambition to buy preferment 
at so dear rate 

nor I to sell my honour 
by live poor and spare I be not 
breed in that ebb of fortune and my fate 
shall not compel i to it

I have lose time indeed come to the winecellar Exit 

but shall we not madam expose ourselves 
to censure for this freedom 

let they answer 
that dare mistake we shall we be so much 
coward to be fright from our pleasure 
because man have malicious tongue and show 
what miserable soul they have no cozen 
we hold our life and fortune upon no 
man charity if they dare show so little 
discretion to traduce our fame we will 
be guilty of so much wit to laugh at they 

it be a become fortitude 

my star 
be yet kind to i for in a happy minute 
be it speak I be not in love and man shall never 
make my heart lean with sigh nor with tear 
draw on my eye the infamy of spectacle

under your own obedience jest but love not 
I say my prayer yet can wear good clothes 
and only satisfy my tailor for they 
I will lose my privilege 

and yet they say your entertainment be 
give i your pardon madam to proclaim 
yourself a widow and to get a husband 

as if a lady of my year some beauty 
leave by her husband rich that have mourn for he 
a twelvemonth too can live so obscure in the town 
that gallant will not know she and invite 
themselves without her chargeable proclamation 
than we be worse than citizen no widow 
leave wealthy can be thorough warm in mourning 
but some one noble blood or lusty kindred 
clap in with his gild coach and flandrian trotter 
and hurry she away to be a countess 
courtier have spy and great one with large title 
cold in their own estate will warm themselves 
at a rich city bonfire 

most true madam 

no matter for corruption of the blood 
some undo courtier make her husband rich 
and this new lord receive it back again 
admit it be my policy and that 
my entertainment point to acquaint i 
with many suitor that I may be safe 
and make the best election can you blame i

to my withdraw chamber I hear all 
their plea in court nor can they boast abroad 
and do i justice after a salute 
they have much conversation with my lip 
I hold the kiss of my hand a courtesy 
and he that love i must upon the strength 
of that expect till I renew his favour 
some lady be so expensive in their grace 
to those that honour they and so prodigal 
that in a little time they have nothing but 
the naked sin leave to reward their servant 
whereas a thrift in our reward will keep 
man long in their devotion and preserve 
ourselves in stock to encourage those that honour we 

this be a art worthy a lady practise 

it take not from the freedom of our mirth 
but seem to advance it when we can possess 
our pleasure with security of our honour

when do thou mean thy body shall lie fallow 

when there be mercy in a petticoat 
I must turn pilgrim for some breath 

I think

upon the hoof through Spain 

through Ethiopia 

nay less laborious to serve a prenticeship 
in Peru and dig gold out of the mine 
though all the year be dogday 

to repentance

within my knowledge will not blush to be a bawd 

but hang it it be honourable journey work 
thou be famous by it and thy name be up

upon her face 

I do not love the copy 
of any dead they make i dream of goblin

the beauty of Celestina come my lord 
it be pity that a lord of so much flesh 
shall waste upon a ghost when they be live

and dote upon your vigil build a chamber

not far off where you may in proof apocryphal 
court they not devour the pretty pile 
of flesh your mistress carry to the grave

a thousand form which your corrupt optic 
will pass for natural 

I desire no other 
judge shall determine we and if your lordship 
dare venture but your eye upon this lady 
I will stand their justice and be confident 
you shall give Celestine victory 
and triumph over all beauty past and live 

i dare my lord venture a suit of clothes 
you will be overcome 

you do not know my fortitude 

nor frailty you dare not trust you self to see she

to make you know your error and the difference 
of she who memory be my saint not trust

as you have pay a way in honest debt 
this seven year it be a pretty impudence 
but can make i angry

you do not sing so well as I imagine 
nor dance you reel in your coranto and pinch 
your petticoat too hard you have no good ear

move i to more than laughter and some pity 
because you have the shape of gentleman 
and though you have be insolent upon i 
I will engage no friend to kick or cudgel you 
to spoil your live and your limb together 
I leave that to disease that offend you

part of a soul course woollen witted fellow 
without a nap with body make for burden 
you that be only stuff for apparel

to frame their clothes upon and get they custom 
until man see you move yet than you dare not 
out of your guilt of be the ignoble beast 
but give a horse the wall who you excel 
only in dance of the brawl because 
the horse be not teach the french way your two face 
one fat like Christmas other lean like Candlemas 
and prologue to a lend both bind together 
will figure janus and do many cure 
on ague and the green disease by fright 
but neither can with all the character 
and conjure circle charm a woman though 
she have fourscore year upon she and but one 
tooth in her head to love or think well of you 
and I be miserable to be at cost 
to court such a complexion as your malice 
do impudent insinuate but I waste time 
and stain my breath in talk to such tadpole 
go home and wash your tongue in barley water 
drink clean tobacco be not hot in the mouth 
and you may escape the beadle so I leave you 
to shame and your own garter sir I must 
entreat you for my honour do not penance they

your opinion mr Littleworth 

your french tailor 
have make you a perfect gentleman I may 
converse now with you and preserve my credit 
do you find no alteration in your body 
with these new clothes 

my body alter no 

you be not yet in fashion then that must 
have a new motion garb and posture too 
or all your pride be cast away it be not 
the cut of your apparel make a gallant 
but the geometrical wear of your clothes 

mr Littleworth tell you right you wear your hat 
too like a citizen 

it be like a midwife 
place it with best advantage of your hair 
be half your feather moult this do make 
no show it shall spread over like a canopy 
your hot rein monsieur wear it for a shade 
and cool to his back your doublet must 
be more unbutton hereabout you will not 
be a sloven else a foul shirt be no blemish 
you must be confident and outface clean linen 
your doublet and your breech must be allow 
no private meeting here your cloak be too long 
it reach to your buttock and do smell 
too much of spanish gravity the fashion 
be to wear nothing but a cape a coat 
may be allow a cover for one elbow 
and some to avoid the trouble choose to walk 
in cuerpo thus 

your coat and cloak be a brush 
in Longlane Lombard 

but what if it rain 

your belt about your shoulder be sufficient 
to keep off any storm beside a reed 
but wave discreet have so many pore 
it suck up all the rain that fall about one 
with this defence when other man have be 
wet to the skin through all their cloak I have 
defy a tempest and walk by the tavern 
dry as a bone 

because he have no money 
to call for wine 

why you do walk enchant 
have you such pretty charm in town but stay 
who must I have to attend i 

be not that 
yet think upon 

I have lay out for servant

with such as I will put into his hand 

of what condition must they be and how 
many in number sir 

beside your fence 
your sing dance ride and frenchmaster 
two may serve domestic to be constant waiter 
upon a gentleman a fool a pimp 

for these two officer I have inquire 
and I be promise a convenient whiskin 
I can save charge and employ the pie wench 
that carry her intelligence in whitepot 
or it be but take order with the woman 
that hold the ballad she can fit he with 
a concubine to any tune but I 
have a design to place a fellow with he 
that have read all sir Pandarus work a trojan 
that lie conceal and be acquaint with 
both city and suburbian frippery 
can fetch they with a spell at midnight to he 
and warrant which be for his turn can for 
a need supply the surgeon too 

I like 
thy providence such a one deserve a livery twice a year 

it shall need a cast suit of your worship 
will serve he will find a cloak to cover it 
out of his share with those he bring to bed to you 

but must I call this fellow pimp 

it be 
not necessary or Jack or harry 
or what he be know abroad by will sound better 
that man may think he be a christian 

but hear you mr Littleworth be there not 
a method and degree of title in 
man of this art 

accord to the honour 
of man that do employ they a emperor 
may give this office to a duke a king 
may have his viceroy to negotiate for he 
a duke may use a lord the lord a knight 
a knight may trust a gentleman and when 
they be abroad and merry gentleman 
may pimp to one another 

good good fellowship 
but for the fool now that shall wait on i 
and break i jest 

a fool be necessary 

by any mean 

but which of these two servant 
must now take place 

that question mr Frederick 
the school of heraldry shall conclude upon 
but if my judgement may be hear the fool 
be your firstman and it be know a point 
of state to have a fool 

but sir the other 
be hold the fine servant his employment 
be full of trust his person cleave and nimble 
and none so soon can leap into preferment 
where fool be poor 

not all there be story for it 
prince have be no wise than they shall be 
will any noble man that be no fool 
spend all in hope of the philosopher stone 
to buy new lordship in another country 
will knight build college or gentleman 
of good state challenge the field and fight 
because a whore will be honest come

and yet be young her presence have a spell 
to keep off age she have a eye will strike 
fire through a adamant 

I have hear as much 
bestow upon a dull face chambermaid 
who love and wit will thus commend true beauty 
be mock when we compare thus itself be 
above what can be fetch to make it lovely 
or can our thought reach some thing to declare 
the glory of a face or body elegance 
that touch but our sense when beauty spread 
over the soul and call up understand 
to look when thence be offer and admire 
in both I must acknowledge Celestina 
most excellent fair fair above all 
the beauty I have see and one most worthy 
man love and wonder 

do you speak Aretina

myself I must be just and give she all 
the excellency of woman and be I 
a man 

what then 

I know not with what loss 
I shall attempt her love she be a piece 
so angelical move I shall think 
frailty excuse to dote upon her form 
and almost virtue to be wicked with she Exit 

what shall this mean this be no jealousy 
or she believe I counterfeit I feel 
something within i like a heat to give

all heart where you persuade a wit so flow 
and prudence to correct it that all man

a spacious memory make up the full wonder 
to these you have know valour and upon 
a noble cause know how to use a sword 
to honour best advantage though you be none

truth and your love of innocence which shine 
so bright in the two royal luminary 
at court you can lose your way to chastity 
proceed and speak of i as honour guide you Exit lord
