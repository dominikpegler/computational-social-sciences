interpret not Clarissa my true zeal 
in give you council to transcend the bound 
that shall confine a brother it be your honour 
and peace of mind which honour last will leave you 
I labour to preserve and though you yet be 
pure and untainted and resolve to be so 
have a father eye and mother care 
in all your way to keep you fair and upright 
in which respect my best advice must 
appear superfluous yet since love dear sister 
will sometime tender thing unnecessary 
misconstrue not my purpose 

sir I dare not 
but still receive it as a large addition 
to the much that I already stand engage for 
yet pardon i though I profess upon 
a true examination of myself 
even to my private thought I can find 
have such strong supporter to uphold i 
on what slight ground the least doubt can be raise 
to render i suspect I can fall 
or from my fame or virtue 

far be it from i 
to nourish such a thought and yet excuse i 
as you will do a lapidary who whole fortune 
depend upon the safety of one jewel 
if he think no case precious enough 
to keep it in full lustre nor no lock 
though lend strength to iron door sufficient 
to guard it and secure he you to i be 
a gem of more esteem and prize high 
than usurer do their muck or great man title 
and any flaw which heaven avert in you 
who reputation like a diamond 
cut new from the rock woman with envy 
and man with covetous desire look up at 
by pry eye discover in a moment 
will render what the bravery of Florence 
for want of counterpoise forbear to cheapen 
of little or no value 

I see brother 
the mark you shoot at and much thank your love 
but for my virgin jewel which be bring 
in comparison with your diamond rest assure 
it shall not fall in such a workman hand 
who ignorance or malice shall have power 
to cast one cloud upon it but still keep 
her native splendour 

it be well I commend you 
and study your advancement with that care 
as I will do a sister who I love 
with more than common order 

that from i 
I hope be return to you 

I do confess it 
yet let i tell you but still with that love 
I wish to increase between we that you be 
observe against the gravity long maintain 
in Italy where to see a maid unmask 
be hold a blemish to be over frequent 
in give or receive visit 

how 

whereas the custom be here to woo by picture 
and never see the substance you be fair 
and beauty draw temptation on you know it 
I will not live to say a willing grant 
from you to one unworthy of your birth 
feature or fortune yet there have be lady 
of rank proportion and of mean beyond you 
that have prove this no miracle 

one unworthy 
why pray you gentle brother who be they that I vouchsafe these bounty to I hope 
in your strict criticism of i and my manner 
that you will not deny they be your equal 

angry 

I have reason but in cold blood tell i 
have we not one father 

yes and mother to 

and he a soldier 

true 

if I then borrow 
a little of the boldness of his temper 
impart it to such as may deserve it 
however indulgent to yourselves you brother 
allow no part of freedom to your sister 
I hope it will not pass for a crime in i 
to grant access and speech to noble suitor 
and you escape for innocent that descend 
to a thing so far beneath you be you touch 
why do you think that you have Gyges ring 
or the herb that give invisibility 
or that Biancha name have never be mention 
the fair maid of the grand osteria brother 

no more 

a little brother your night walk 
and offer present which coy she contemn 
your combat in disguise with your rival 
brave muleteer scullion perfume with grease 
and such as cry meat for cat must be remember 
and all this pother for a common trull 
a tempt sign and curious set forth 
to draw in riotous guest a thing expose 
to every ruffian rude assault and subject 
for a poor salary to a rich man lust 
though make up of disease 

will you end yet 

and this a mistress for Albertus son 
one that I shall call sister 

part not with 
your modesty in this violent heat the truth be 
for you shall be my confessor I love she 
but virtuous report that give she out 
only for fair and add not she be chaste 
detract much from she for indeed she be 
though of a low condition compose 
of all those grace dame of high birth 
though rich in nature bounty shall be proud of 
but leave she and to you my near care 
my dear best Clarissa do not think 
for then you wrong i I wish you shall live 
a barren virgin life I rather aim at 
a noble husband that may make you mother 
of many child one that when I know he 
worth your embrace I may serve and sue to 
and therefore scorn not to acquaint i with 
that man that happy man you please to favour 

I ever purpose it for I will like 
with your allowance 

as a pawn of this 
receive this ring but ere you part with it 
on any term be certain of your choice 
and make it know to i 

you have my hand for it 

which be it not my sister I shall kiss 
with too much heat 

my father and his guest sir 

o my old friend my try friend my Baptista

our tough nature those be golden one 
which be enjoy at sea that be our true mother 
the land be to we a stepdame there we seek 
honour and wealth through danger yet those danger 
delight more than their reward though great one 
and worth the undertaker here we study 
the kitchen art to sharpen appetite 
dull with abundance and dispute with heaven 
if that the least puff of the rough northwind 
blast our time burden render to our palate 
the charm juice less please whereas there 
if we have biscuit powder flesh fresh water 
we think they persian delicate and for music 
if a strong gale but make the main yard crack 
we dance to the loud minstrel 

And fear less 
so far we be in love with noble action 
a tempest than a calm 

it be true Baptista 
there there from mutual aid lend to each other 
and virtuous emulation to exceed 
in manly dare the true school of friendship 
we learn those principle which confirm we friend 
never to be forget

a loud proclaim it lawful and a prize 
then new take and equal divide 
serve as a dowry to you then style my wife 
and do enable i to be a husband 
fit to encounter so much wealth though get 
with blood and horror

of your sex may excuse you I will not argue 
but to the world however I hold thou noble 
I shall proclaim this boy some coward bastard 
and not the image of Albertus youth 
if when some wish occasion call he forth 
to a brave trial one weak artery 
of he shall show a fever though grim death 
put on a thousand dreadful shape to fright he 
the element the sea and all the wind 
we number on our compass then conspire 
to make the scene more ghastly I must have thou 
sirrah I must if once you grapple with 
a enemy ship to board she though you see 
the desperate gunner ready to give fire 
and blow the deck up or like Caesar soldier 
thy hand like his cut off hang by the tooth 
and die undaunted 

I even die to hear you 
my son my love Cesario run such hazard 
bless saint forbid it you have do enough 
already for one family that rude way 
I will keep he safe at home and train he up 
a complete courtier may I live to see he 
by sweet discourse and gracious demeanour 
win and bring home a fair wife and a rich 
it be all I rest ambitious of 

a wife 
as if there be a course to purchase one 
prevail more than honourable action 
or any intercessor move so far 
to take a mistress of a noble spirit 
as the true fame of glorious victory 
achieve by sweat and blood o the brave dame 
of warlike Genoa they have eye to see 
the inward man and only from his worth 
courage and conquest the blind archer know 
to head his shaft or light his quench torch 
they be proof against they else 
no carpet knight 
that spend his youth in grove or pleasant bower 
or stretch on a couch his lazy limb 
sing to his lute such soft and melt note 
as Ovid nor Anacreon ever know 
can work on they nor once bewitch their sense 
though he come so perfume as he have rob 
Sabaea or Arabia of their wealth 
and store it in one suit 
I still remember 
and still remember it with joy Baptista 
when from the rescue of the Genoa fleet 
almost surprise by the venetian galley 
thou do return and be receive in triumph 
how lovely in thy honour wound and scar 
thou do appear what world of amorous glance 
the beauty of the city where they stand 
fix like so many of the fair star 
shoot from their window at thou how it fire 
their blood to see the enemy captive stream 
bear through the street nor can chaste Juliana 
the duke fair niece though guard with their greatness 
resist this gallant charge but lay by 
disparity of fortune from the object 
yield herself thy prisoner 

pray you choose some other theme 

can there be one more please 

that triumph draw on i a great torture 
and it be in the remembrance little less 
than ever captive suffer 

how to gain the favour of so great a lady 

yes since it prove fatal to have be happy madam 
add to calamity nad the heavy loss 
of she I dare not hope for once enjoy 
turn what you think a blessing to a curse 
which grief will have forget 

I be sorry I touch upon it 

I burn rather sir 
with a desire to hear the story of 
your love and shall receive it as a favour 
which you may grant

enamour of my action like my person 
nor can I but with joy meet her affection 
since it be lawful for my first wife dead 
we be close marry and for some few month 
taste the fruit of it but malicious fate 
envy our too much happiness wrought upon 
a faithless servant privy to our plot 
and cabinet councillor to Juliana 
who either for hope or reward or fear 
discover we to the incense duke 
who rage make her close prisoner and pronounce 
on i perpetual banishment some three year 
I wander on the sea since entertain 
by the great duke of Florence but what fate

so these old man vanish it be allow 
that we may speak and howsoever they take 
delight in the discourse of former danger 
it can hinder we to treat a little 
of present pleasure 

which if we well enjoy 
will not alone continue but increase 
in we their friendship 

how shall we spend the night 
to snore it out like drunken Dutchman will 
sort ill with we italian we be make 
of other metal fiery quick and active 
shall we take our fortune and while our cold father 
in who long since our youthful heat be dead 
talk much of Mars serve under Venus ensign 
and seek a mistress 

that be a game dear friend 
that do admit not rival in chase of it 
and either to be undertake alone 
or not to be attempt 

I will not press you 
what other sport to entertain the time with 
the follow morning 

any that may become we 

be the neapolitan horse the viceroy send you 
in a fit plight to run 

so my groom tell i 
I can boast little of my horsemanship 
yet upon his assurance I dare wager 
a thousand crown against any horse in Florence 
for a eight mile course 

I will not win of you 
in respect you be impatient of loss 
else I dare match he with my Barbary 
for twice the sum 

you do well to excuse it be certain to be beat 

tush you know the contrary 

to end the controversy 
put it to trial by my life I will meet you 
with the next rise sun

those amorous smile those kiss but sure chaste one 
which she vouchsafe her brother 

you be wanton 
pray you think i not Biancha leave I pray you 
my mother will not sleep before she see you 
and since you know her tenderness nay fondness 
in every circumstance that concern your safety

she stay bless opportunity she stay 
as she invite conference she be ever 
noble and free but thus to tempt my frailty 
argue a yield in she or contempt 
of all that I dare offer stand I now 
consult no I will put it home 

who wait there more light 

you need they not they be as useless 
as at noonday can there be darkness where 
nature then wise liberal vouchsafe 
to lend two sun 

hyperbole 

no truth 
truth beauteous virgin so my lovesick heart 
assure i and my understanding tell i 
I must approach they wise shall I rash 
press near their scorch beam they will consume i 
and on the contrary shall your disdain

pray you pause sir 
this vehemency of discourse must else needs tire you 
these gay word take not i it be simple faith

ere I come to a period I have add 
a long experience must be require 
both of his faith and trust with who a virgin 
traffic for what be dear in this life

I oft have view you with a eye of favour 
and with your generous part the many tender 
of do i all fair office have win

and that you bring the engine of fair love 
not of foul lust to shake and undermine 
my maiden fortress I may then make good 
what now I dare not promise

in take notice of my poor deserve 
have be magnificent and it will appear 
a frontless impudence to ask beyond this 
yet qualify though not excuse my error

a confirmation of it 

so it wrong not my modesty to grant it 

it be far from i 
I only be a suitor you will grace i 
with some toy but make rich in that you wear it 
to warrant to the world that I usurp not 
when I presume to style myself your servant

shall witness how I prize you it grow late 
I will bring you to the door

the preparation of the Turk against we

will argue want of courage and I hold it 
a safe policy for we and our signory 
to charge he in his passage over the sea 
then to expect he here 

may it please your highness 
since you vouchsafe to think i worthy of 
this great employment if I may deliver 
my judgement free it be not flattery

that be not all the switch he dull he 

will that both the jade 
have break their neck when they first start light 
we stand here prate give they leave to whisper

from young Mentivole my rage so far

for a worthy father yet I will not lose 
my former virtue my integrity 
shall not yet forsake i but as the wild ivy 
spread and thrive better in some piteous ruin 
of tower or deface temple than it do 
plant by a new building so shall I 
make my adversity my instrument 
to wind i up into a full content 

it be worthy resolve our first adventure 
be to stop the marriage for thy other loss 
practise by a woman malice but account they 
like conjurer wind raise to a fearful blast 
and do some mischief but do never last exeunt 

now sir will you not acknowledge that I have mighty advance your practice 

it be confess and I will make thou a great man for it 

I take a course to do that myself for I drink sack in abundance 

o my rare rascal we must remove 

whither 

any whither Europe be too little to be cozen by we I be ambitious to go to the Eastindies thou and I to ride on our brace of elephant 

and for my part I long to be in England again you will never get so much as in England we have shift many country and many name but trance the world over you shall never purse up so much gold as when you be in England and call yourself doctor lambstone 

it be a attractive name I confess woman be then my only admirer 

and all their visit be either to further their lust or revenge injury 

you shall have forty in a morning beleaguer my closet and strive who shall be cozen first among fourscore lovesick weight woman that have come to i in a morning to learn what fortune shall betide they in their first marriage I have find above 94 to have lose their maidenhead 

by their own confession but I be fain to be your male midwife and work it out of they by circumstance 

thou be and yet for all this frequent resort of woman and thy handle of their urinal and their case thou be not give to lechery what shall be the reason of it thou have wholesome flesh enough about thou methinks the devil shall tempt thou to it 

what need he do that when he make i his instrument to tempt other 

thou can not choose but utter thy rare good part thou be a excellent bawd I acknowledge 

well and what I have do that way I will spare to speak of all you and I have do sir and though we shall 

we will for England that be for certain 

we shall never want there 

want the court of ward shall want money first for I profess myself lord Paramount over fool and madfolk 

do but store yourself with lie enough against you come thither 

why that be all the familiarity I ever have with the devil my gift of lie they say he be the father of lie and though I can conjure yet I profess myself to be one of his poor gossip I will now reveal to thou a rare piece of service 

what be it my most worshipful doctor lambstone 

there be a captain come late from sea 
they call prosper I see he this morning 
through a chink of wainscot that divide my lodging 
and the host of the house withdraw my host and hostess the fair Biancha and a ancient gentlewoman into their bedchamber I can not overhear their conference but I see such a mass of gold and jewel and when he have do he lock it up into a casket great joy there be among they and forth they be go into the city and my host tell i at his go forth he think he shall not return till after supper now sir in their absence will we fall to our picklock enter the chamber seize the jewel make a escape from Florence and we be make for ever 

but if they shall go to a true conjurer and fetch we back in a whirl wind 

do not believe there be any such fetch in astrology and this may be a mean to make we live honest hereafter 

it be but a ill road to it that lie through the high way of thieve 

for indeed I be weary of this trade of fortunetelling and mean to give all over when I come into England for it be a very ticklish quality 

And in the end will hang by a twine thread 

beside the island have too many of the profession they hinder one another market 

no no the pillory hinder their market 

you know there the juggle captain 

i there be a sure card 

only the foreman of their jury be dead but he die like a roman 

else it be think he have make work for the hangman 

and the very ball of your false prophet he be quash too 

he do measure the star with a false yard and may now travail to Rome with a mortar on his head to see if he can recover his money that way 

Come come let we fish for this casket and to sea present 

we shall never reach London I fear 
my mind run so much of hanging land at wap 
This well may be a day of joy long wish for 
to my Clarissa she be innocent 
nor can her youth but with a open bosom 
meet Hymen please bounty but to i 
that be environ with black guilt and horror 
it do appear a funeral though promise much 
in the conception be hard to manage 
but sad in the event it be not hate 
but fond indulgence in i to preserve 
cesarios threaten life in open court 
that force i to disclaim he choose rather 
to rob he of his birthright and honour 
then suffer he to run the hazard of 
enrage Baptista fury while he live 
I know I have a son and the duke sentence 
a while delude and this tempest over 
when he assure himself despair have seize he 
I can relieve and raise he speak who be it 
that press on my privacy sir your pardon 
you can come unwelcome though it be 
to read my secret thought

I shall have style you and I now may claim it 
since our divide family be make one 
by this bless marriage to who honour come 
the duke in person wait on by all 
the bravery of his court to witness it 
and then to be our guest be the bride ready 
to meet and entertain he

pray you bring she forth 
the duke at hand music in her loud voice 
speak his arrival

since all joy dwell about you Hymen torch 
be never slight with a lucky omen 
nor burn with so much splendour to defer 
with fruitless compliment the mean to make 
your certain pleasure lawful to the world 
since in the union of your heart they be 
confirm already will but argue we 
a boaster of our favour to the temple 
and there the sacred knot once tie all triumph 
our dukedom can afford shall grace your nuptial 

on there 

I hope it be not in the power 
of any to cross we now 

but in the breath 
of a wrong father I forbid the band 

what do you stand at gaze 

rise from the dead 

although the sea have vomit up the figure 
in which thy better part live long imprison 
true love despise fear run thus to meet it 

in duty I kneel to it 

hence vile wretch

and not to be profane with your vile touch 
that can so soon forget i but such thing 
be neither worth my anger nor reproof 
to you great sir I turn myself and these 
immediate minister of your government 
and if in my rude language I transgress 
ascribe it to the cold remembrance of 
my service and not my rugged temper

receive for a offence I tame bear 
wrong which a slaveborn Muscovite will check at 
why if for treason I have be deliver 
up to the hangman axe and this dead trunk 
unworthy of a christian sepulchre 
expose a prey to feed the ravenous vulture 
the memory of the much I oft do for you 
have you but any touch of gratitude 
or thought of my deserve will have stop you 
from these unjust proceed

and from that in his love scorn by a creature 
who base birth though make eminent by her beauty 
may well have mark she out Cesario servant 
all this I can have pardon and forget 
but that my daughter with my whole estate 
so hardly purchase be assign a dower 
to one who father and who family 
I so detest that I will lose my essence 
and be transform to a basilisk 
to look they dead to i be a injury 
admit no satisfaction 

there be none offer 

nor will not be accept 
though upon thy knee it be tender 

now the storm grow high 

but that I think thou dead and in thy death 
the briny ocean have entomb thy name

a patient looker on though as yet doubtful 
to who to bend her knee first yet to all

the dust of fury with my virgin tear 
from his blessed foot and make they beautiful
