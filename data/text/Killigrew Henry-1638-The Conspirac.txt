s some back again this way myself will take 
and as you go call those chaste woodman 
to your aid who often help we in the chase 
mingle with every step a call and if 
a echo but resound her name utter it 
again until you be confirm 
I have lose a nymph in who I glory more 
than all those proud trophy to my name 
she excel in fame in birth in beauty 
and be patroness of she well I may 
be call the goddess of strict chastity 
she be herself a guard unto herself 
her beauty so command good do keep 
her chastity and her chastity make 
her beauty safe lust may soon gaze to 
virtue in her eye then spy one of its 
know deformity 
and much I fear some satire or worse power 
have betray her innocent step and now 
detain she adore yet what he mean 
to spoil or Jove again in some various 
shape of love wrong both his deity and i 

and why bright Phoebe may not a more 
equal love Endymion Hippolytus 
or a fair youth persuade she not from 
her chastity but you 

Juno on the earth 

but this thought too likely and too common 
to be entertain you think if aught be 
lose it must be lose afar pass Hymen 
temple that border on your grove and search 
the cave nay believe heaven be a near 
enemy if Jove do court she it be in 
the shape of Ganymede for such be he 
that lead she from your train but turn and prove 
how much you be lose in fear not she in love 
see in this glorious perspective where sit 
your so deplore nymph and the lovely satyr 
that ensnare she can you against his noble 
breast bend a dart or wish it thither 
see where Cupid stand and laugh ready 
in his just offence if you shoot to shoot 
another tempt he not at so great odds 
oft time such beauty have inflame the god 
it seem you little deal in marriage 
that can be so ignorant of this day 
than which none be ever more expect 
more proclaim this be no midnight bargain 
nor steal match but like unto the lover 
know and eminent first by their parent 
think on and conclude who be not sad 
judge but prophet of their after love 
then defer till Minerva have enrich 
the one and your pure law the other 
and last of all when in this high manner 
fame with her loud blast have ask the bond 
and none be find so bold bad nor proud 
envious to intrude join they be by the 
sacred hand of majesty 
why droop Diana 

thus daily to behold the noble of my train 
snatch from i and Hymen torch outshine the 
virgin taper 

this day your power be not diminish her 
name and not her chastity be lose she be 
only change from a pure virgin to as 
pure a bride 

and yet it joy i to see 
my fear thus end 

express it in welcome of this royal 
pair who thsis have cause it grace they with your 
best endeavour and what the other want 
of honour they daily can bestow 
let we join and perform something that may be worthy of their presence who of our ready servant shall we grace with this employment 

i great goddess 

tragedia the enemy of thing 
fair and prosperous what have she to do 
with love or marriage unless it be to 
confound they who so oft before the altar 
happy with the flower and virgin hand 
that deck it have offer up the lover 
a sad sacrifice delight still ere 
Phoebus can withdraw to hasten a night 
of sorrow over the day 
from these solemnity be far away 
thou thy buskin crown and robe fill the 
scene with tumult and with blood thy mild 
sister gentle comedy far sitter 
for these sport we will entertain who can present 
soft and sweet love example of this night 
begin sour but end with delight 

how much divine Juno speak below 
herself in prefer what she must scorn 
to name can she desire to do something 
in honour of this assembly something 
as when the god be please and wish to see it 
in so low a strain entertain prince 
and in comedy poor vain will she have 
a epithalamion in these lover praise 
and hear it chant in rude roundelay 
as all profane let these be far away 
unworthy in this night to bear a part 
what a mockery will such be of their 
noble love to have its pure name smother 
by so gross a fire their brave action 
parallel with such country jig of Cupid 
ridiculous imitate with 
their long passion no if Juno do 
desire to crown these hour above the rest 
and make they welcome yet before the best 
these do enjoy through peace and innocence 
let she perform something that be godlike they 
which be happy need no show of mirth their 
state be comedy enough sport do not fit 
this night but glory if it be heroic 
then it be opposite which make i offer 
thus my service as most due to i to 
show the will that speak the language of the 
god and as I be thus tax with blood and 
cruelty it be not my line that wound they 
but their fault represent 
and though they be with vice and fate oppress 
yet those which see a tragedy be bless 

thou have prevail make this night such as thou have speak or if thy thought be high equal they 
for know the god oversee these hour solemnity 

if Juno smile here I shall favour find 
these like the god accept the will and mind 

so dispatch dispatch what wine be those 

the late present from the merchant 

it be well 

be all thing ready fellow the king be on enter 1 they be my lord 

ha ha ha no happiness like the fool Comastes 

no none sir he be mirth itself and the cause of it in other they say all pleasure be a shadow then that which we enjoy be but the shadow of a shadow hardly the picture of what he embrace our delight be faint thwart by the conscience start with fear and after a hour of pleasure a week of repentance in which time we live by rule and not by custom laugh not though the jest be good nor rage though at a just cause but sickly whisper out our say as though they be our last and eat our chicken with the curtain draw when the fool lust with his whole soul too and sin till he be weary know no conscience but his want that way nor remorse but disability 

hah ha ha 

nature never show her liberality more than to those she be spare of her best gift to she house wisdom in a body full of decay and require her whole strength to bear off the ruin measure his leg with the spider give he pale and wan look scarce alter from the earth he be make of where to the idiot she bestow a body equal with the bulk of tree and arm as thunderproof make he a strong a large and healthy fool 

ha ha ha 

fit lecture for such a Sholler 

well Comastes thou shall not want for a coat if that will do it 

send i a mind to with it and you have not a great present for your neighbour prince 

Come my lord let we sit and fill up our cup 
make they like our joy still full and flow 
thus it shall be my lord in a state that 
know no trouble let unhappy prince 
who loss do afflict and fear affright 
make yearly feast but we who even affair 
do follow one another and do keep 
there just period though the reins be loose 
and their guide sleep seem rather so to 
have fall out than so cause each day shall 
be a triumph each hour a feast 

we may chance to find one out for funeral 

a health to all and a long peace 

you be melancholy Aratus clap he somewhat rude 

you be rude Comastes and let i tell you 

his lordship be one of those which say their prayer backward for the state and end in black wish 

you be the fox that thrive by it 
Phro Aratus your anger be unseasonable and the king mark it 

how now Aratus what be the matter our table shall know no frown than least of all when we ourself forbear they 

royal sir I ask your pardon he wake i something rude and get a froward answer 

what all dead fill another round our wine move not here Polyander to thou what think thou of Comastes happiness 

I think sir it be as dull as foolish there can be a sense of pleasure where there be so little sense greatness be the centre of all happiness and felicity like our land at first be tie to the crown king come never unto the god and be like they both in power and pleasure do command all enjoy all be miserable only in too much and want but what to wish for this be the dazzle happiness it be vain therefore to prefer private joy before the crownpleasure the king may throw by his greatness when he please and be poor happy the beggar will never sigh unto a sceptre 

why I polyander there be some life in this a little heaven even in the apprehension Aratus be not thou of this opinion 

not I sir nor of my lord the fool be there 
king be more miserable than they seem 
happy flatter by themselves and other 
into a joy that be not and what they 
feel they rather do believe than find so 
yet I grant too a king may be happy 
but never as a king Felicity 
be a purchase and no inheritance 
nor have the prerogative more than one 
life in it neither it die still with the buyer 
trouble be the good king profession 
in the war the first dart be throw at he 
where his happiness be in a glorious death 
or else his godlike ray pluck from he 
by some accurse hand and so fall less 
happy be but wish so by a poor 
revenge he know not 

very grave and unseasonable thus your lordship get the reputation of singularity which the vulgar suspect to be wisdom 

sir you see how this place and my freeness be injure 

mirth only mirth Aratus he mean it will better become a counsel than a banquet 

Timeus welcome nay keep your seat will thou have be partaker of our sport 

when that my action or my age shall make i worthy of your ease and pleasure I shall be a thankful sharer but till then your trouble will become i better than your sport and care will sit more lovely on my brow than rose sir those that be about you seek to drown your virtue 

your lordship mean none here 

I name none here my lord 

nay Timeus thou never look friendly on our pleasure 

I must confess sir I have rather see you bloody than thus wet nor be my wish impious Poliander 

my lord 

how base that smile become thou I have 
rather thou have answer i with a blow 
than such a look I think to have ask thou 
Something but I see thou be unworthy 
of a brave demand thy skill lie only 
in the curiosity of a meal 
to say at the first touch a the tongue this be 
a chian this a falernian wine 
straight by the colour of the flesh to know 
whether the foul be cram or whether feed 
prithee Polyander how sit the wind 
when this boar be slay be not these apple 
pull the moon increase degenerate 
I have see thou put thy face into a frown 
and be it so constant in that look as if 
thou have no other 

sir when you shall find or make a cause I will put they on again here they will but sour the entertainment 

you see my lord they be not drown they live still under water 

like thy beast 

prithee Timeus let we enjoy our mirth while the god give it the time will come that we shall wish for it and not have it on my conscience thou wish for enemy that thou may cut they off 

I be sorry I have offend against your mirth it be not my intent I come to bring you news 

news what be it good 

it be as you shall esteem on it sir there be a strange prince arrive 

hither 

yes sir his visit force by a storm as he pretend 

whatever the occasion be he shall be welcome the time be far spend Aratus it shall be thy employment from we fair salute the prince and tell he though the sea have be unfriendly the land shall court he 

great sir you high honour i 

So now we have time to speak what think thou Aratus of these passage 

well brave well 

your speech strike desperate at the king he will not swallow it without some touch of jealousy 

it be no matter he can cross we now 
none but the god can do it nor they without 
a miracle great as be their providence 
which hitherto have save we we have not 
take so many year to build a work up 
and then to have it ruine with a push 
no he that will shake it must first overthrow 
a kingdom a prince a law so large 
the extent be never do plot thrive like it 
it have infect with the holy sore 
the great part of the realm and catch daily 
like some unheard of new opinion 
straighten at first and prison in the breast 
of two or three gain strength by time and ear 
and daily feed by curiosity 
thrust out at last the old and most receive 
and grow the whole religion of the place 
when we have call our party forth the work 
will seem do the thin number which be leave 
not deserve the name of enemy 
the tyrant then will see himself no more 
a king only the wretched cause of war 
his power be ravishd from he 

while the fruit thus ripe why do we let it grow 

and spoil perhaps 

we will not long only a little ceremony detain we to crown our king that past our action and our thought shall then contend in motion 

How speed your visit to the young prince 

most happy 
o have you see with i there the dear cause 
of this our danger you will have think it 
so no more but stand contemn life 
think your blood ill store within your vein 
when that his service call it sure it be some such 
shape and sweetness which first slave man 
and gain a rule before there be a kingdom 

you forget your message to the prince 

o it be true our next part be to delight ourselves in do something pray bear i company we may get thanks for it another day exeunt 

devil whether will thou hurl i the ship 
sink under so much ill nor can the earth 
bear we both together the great hill 
press not her face with half that load one thought 
of goodness make i light than the wave 
and at a instant teach i how to swim 

Harpastes 

Melampus

I hope so 

then the storm have play the hangman and save we innocent 

Innocent what be that it have save we so much labour and a break head perhaps 

the wrack be great and full of horror 

how the rogue pray and roar above the wave vow whole herd of offering for their safety but Neptune save they charge and take the verger beast 

we escape miraculous 

I hope you will burn no bullock to the sea 

no my vow be of another nature I vow to live well and change my bloody purpose 

thou do not mean in earnest 

I do then but I no soon touch the shore and safety but my old thought return 

Come we will go claim our hire and swear we kill he before the storm our fellow dead pay will fall to we we will demand for loss ay and our danger too 

if my eye deceive i not here come one will deny the payment 

it be he be resolute and follow i

my lord

always my lord by you but now she be come forth 

save you sweet sister 

o you be welcome sir 

sure Eudora Venus and the grace have their hand today about you you look fair than yourself and move in the sphere of love and beauty Cupid have take his stand up in your eye and shoot at all that come before he pray Venus he miss i 

when begin your serious 

these be the sweet look that captivate the prince in a free country and this the dress that must inchant he ha 

there be no charm in it certain it please i the least of many no it be your fair mistress which bear those lovenet about she if the stranger escape she he be safe 

have better kill his father and then gaze upon the spectacle than look upon she with the eye of love 

nay then you be cruel will you have he strong than yourself be if he be guilty the same doom must light on you too 

but I have prevail so far that he shall be free from the danger both of love and see she will not be there nor must you make up his entertainment 

I be command to be ready and attend there 

but now the commission alter and run in another sense 

I shall be content to obey either may I not know the cause 

you may we will not feed the prince here with hope to get a wife this be the storm that drive he in nor must you only for this time forbear his presence but while he stay he be unworthy of you 

if you know he so I shall then without 
excuse deny his visit but I think 
this business may be bear a noble way 
nor will the end fail though the mean be fair 
leave it with i if he sue with honour 
he will take a honourable answer 
though he gain none from i I will get his love 
and send he home no less a friend than if 
he be a husband by my restraint you will 
only gain unto yourself the mark of 
jealousy and malice and foul stain 
if that the crime be name to the desert 
beside it do proclaim in i too such 
a weakness as I be much ashamed of 
have he a face adorn with the grace 
of both sex beauty and manliness 
and these ingraft on the body of 
a god I can look on converse ay and 
neglect he too when I have reason fear 
not i then 

I do not I know thou strong the honour of a kingdom may lean with safety on thou but he will linger here too long besot the state with feast and in this ease give safety to treacherous undertake he must be use ill there be reason for it 

be there then a policy in rudeness 
why do you rather send a defiance 
to he proclaim he enemy this be 
noble far than to receive he in your arm 
and then affront he say health and wish 
poison in the cup be you so much below he 

there be great thought in hand than curious rule of ceremony if he send any present to you return it back with scorn 

pride be ill become and hate by the next proud man 

then take they and laugh at he 

no where my thank be too much I will rather return gift for gift I will be loath to have my fault reach further than my goodness 

he will wear those gift for favour 

they will not prove so yet he will deserve some as he be a stranger 

not from you reward the state will give he you hear my father will you must not see he while he stay 

I do and shall easy keep that I do not care to break 

farewell 

must you be go 

there be a little business call i 

if be but a little stay 

only the welcome of the stranger 

it be too much to hinder 
I see a causeless and a needless age 
hide in your breast the prince may be noble 
valiant if you receive he then with scorn 
he will prove a strong enemy than those 
unworthy one you fear at home who own 
action daily ruin and who ill make 
knot will loosen fast than they tie they 
you have prevail with i I will not be win 
to see he now but let it not appear 
by your default and that my retirement 
be only in scorn to he which will be 
make plain if that you change not this face you 
have put on it become you at no time 
a prince shall always smile or look indifferent 
he have no need of frown as other man 
all life be in his breath and if they do 
offend his revenge be know and need not 
be declare by face expression where there be 
power to punish it be tyranny to rage 
anger be no attribute of justice 
it be true she be paint with a sword but look 
as if she hold it not though war be in 
her hand yet peace dwell in her face learn once 
of i and when you have no cause of a 
distemper express none now you have make 
all sure doubt not but receive the stranger 
with fearless and confident embrace 

I will or at least I will tell thou so when thou persuade i thus farewell Exit Timeus 

thy subtle plot will ruin thou at last 
valour and policy do seldom meet 
yet here they be in their extreme in one 
but do most strange divide the owner 
make he dread none and yet confirm he not 
within a guard Exit 

be this your royal entertainment a common host will have give one as civil show his guest their quarter and then leave they to stumble out again my receiver be all vanish a undeserving scorn will trouble i neither of the two prince be in the train they may have trust they I can have gage a kingdom for their security the mean thing displease i not if they be the full offering of the place and grateful I can submit to the necessity but where they be afford I can relish nothing but the choice and look on aught but what invite the general and first eye here a continual spring and harvest make but one season no scarcity do dwell but in their mind and then I think myself neglect with the best thing 
be not the fellow drink 
now they begin to muster up again here I stand like one that learn to make his first honour 
when come the four three of the element have pass by simple and unmixed water earth and air lively express than in a masque the four be in the prince he singe my face with a compliment I be arrive among a strange people than ever I hear lie of yet at my return I shall have undiscovered story enough to fill a map though the land be know I have pass some two degree and may lawful extend my line to twenty and fill the vacuity with monster and fishhead 
sir by your favour if your business call you not pray let i entreat your company awhile 

troth an it like your grace I be in haste in very great haste the king have send for i and I know he be thirsty till I come I will your grace be as resolute and as well arm this way as I he discover a great goblet you will be the welcome man he love a royal drunkard with admiration he never see one yet but in a glass sir have you any business with he you need no other orator than such as this such a mouth without a tongue will persuade any thing yet this be of the least fit only for physicday when he will not surfeit a mere toy that trouble the waiter with often fill but I have one as high here be nothing to measure it by it be that make i so inward with he I always use to petition with it it be big than any of his own and please he above measure the first time he see it he commend the largeness of my mind and say it be a noble emulation in i he have a daughter sir a beautiful lady my hope unless some neighbour prince do reel betwixt we your grace come the right way he hate a dry inland traveller but that you kiss the cup and have too much bounce and down with he in you which be thing he surfeit on some fifteen year since and still the very name turn his stomach beside your navy and attendant be too great he will have esteem more on you have they be few enough only to lean on when you be overtake or if you have want those and borrow his unto your chamber it have be better where he find worth the pomp delight he not your pardon sir 

this be strange than all with what licence this fellow abuse his master or speak truth altogether as unpardonable sure he have a patent for it I see I shall want name for all the monster 

though your grace be here a stranger I may demand of you where the king be 

if none know more than I my lord you have lose your king 

sure he be not well I hope he be not with a safe loyalty I may wish he have a dangerous cause rather than none to take he from a prince the first night of his arrival in court 

my lord I have find much honour in you one that know to show more civility to a strange than he can deserve and only be unhappy at this time in a unworthy choice but if you still can continue this nobleness though the king frown I shall glad make some stay at least till I have satisfy a stranger curiosity and may seem rather to have leave the place than to have be thrust from it 

believe i my lord both your entertainment and this necessity that you be drive to use so mean a service as i do shame i much it be not the nature of this place to be thus uncivil nor be tour custom as it have be this day to coop our lady up as if the sight be dangerous their beauty will endure the test and we will put they to it it be unkind do I know one look of they will have give a welcome to a young man above the great cost 

my lord you know to speak a please language 

we have two princess sir few kingdom can show such jewel but only one be oriental the other be artificial but a excellent gem too one of they the true one I doubt not but I have credit for to show you but it be not to be purchase that happy opportunity be already past and the now owner esteem it above his wealth his life ay and his honour too aside 

yet my lord bless i with the sight I can rejoice at so much excellence though another do possess it and no doubt as much of the owner felicity lie in other admiration as in his own possession 

all but jealous man think so and they count themselves rob of all happiness in their wife another do receive be as covetous of their beauty as many husband of their person think themselves cuckold by a woman commendation but my lord I will leave you I be go to the princess before I meet your grace I know few word will gain so easy a request tomorrow and daily I will wait upon your lordship 

sir you have engage i your servant beyond my hope of freedom exeunt omnes 

nay you must bear it patient my dominion extend no further than these room and beyond they I grant nothing how will you endure the stranger delay that thus hardly brook his come the king in compliment will not admit the wind to serve soon than a month be that all his stay but here must be masque and triumph before he go and the subject yet not know for the one nor ornament make for the other perhaps a league must be conclude and then I will not live to be so old as to see the end on it the mean person will require a month to fit themselves a prince can turn in less than a season 

may you not see the garden madam 

no nor the day but through a window 

we will petition to he under the title of distress damsel that must pass the flower of their age in imprisonment unless he will travel to his own or some other country to gain they freedom 

madam he will think we be hold by enchantment that his absence and not his sword must gain our liberty faith wench what will you do with such a servant that will lay command on you and be your lord before Hymen have make he so 

madam I will change he 

leave he I will but change he be a hard matter and will require more consideration I have not the faith that I can work so great a miracle as to persuade i to any thing he have not a mind to and yet he swear he love i as he love a kingdom

the scurvy entertainment I do not think it possible so short a time can have prepare one so ill it be think on before and pain take to order it so much for the worse this be the first day that ever methinks the king and my lord Timeus look like the father and the sun the king have on his old council face which all hope he have forget and this be the only time these many year he shall not have wear it they both embrace the stranger as cold and careless as if they have be to fight after this behaviour in the great one be present observe like a new fashion and in a instant the whole train be in from the brave to those which follow a fashion only when it be to leave off something and then look not as if they be hot but want a cloak marry their wit be not so changeable as their face and have but one sure of compliment and that now unfashionable they be fain to supply it with leg and silence 

how look the prince on their behaviour 

he look much above it in my opinion two foot high than my lord Timeus though not altogether so tall these sour look be all the withoutdoor show which indeed in a solemn march they return all into the palace shew paper the stranger seem rather to follow with a silent consent than a invitation there the press shake i off to find this out for your grace mirth and at my return as I least expect I find the prince all alone where anybody may have see he for nothing the grecian and the trojan captain in the hang be all his company with who he seem well suit have they be alive his look be as challenge as they and stand so breed much comparison 

know you the reason of this behaviour 

no madam yet if I will I may have learn of many indeed all can give a reason those which only from this occasion know what belong to any the whole company be politician there be one yeoman Statesman inform most about he and leave they to write his letter for certain news into the country

more advantage give they to be cruel 

can the grave 
quicken her ash into soldier shall 
stench and corruption yield we enemy 
we be safe from those that live they will not hurt 
and those that sleep in the forget dust 
can there be nothing now remain 
to our care but to give thanks we be safe 
enough if that we can rejoice thou let 
thy best day pass without receive fruit 
that shall be crop from they I do expect 
thou shall have urge i to thy nuptial 
such care befit thou best how the triumph 
shall be order and Hymen torch well light 

pray heaven no other flame break out 
but such as mirth show forth when treason laugh 
upon your sport you call it piety 
cause it look smooth on your strength when it run 
out in a idle pomp suffer your vigour 
to waste itself in triumph and diminish 
in a continue jollity that so sir 
ruin may be quiet and you perish 
without disturbance nor be all thing yet 
so free from our suspicion as you make they 
you do suppose that all close eye must sleep 
when they be never more watchful than when thus 
they counterfeit neglect severe pry 
into the depth of thing by seem not 
to observe the face and outside treason do 
walk in a whisper yet their hate be busy 
and make no noise think not that it be their fear 
but their advice and council make it silent 
do you expect a proclamation or 
a herald from sedition it be too late 
to say you be deceive when that the trumpet 
shall summon to your ruin you do slumber 
gird you before the fire have gain your cabin 
and do not trust your preservation to 
a miracle or a chance you have a heir 
yet he be none of you he that beget i 
do perish long ago I be the child 
of vigour not of luxury 
I must tell you sir 
a few flatter lord gild over the defect 
and ruin of your state they make you call 
a lethargy security and that a kingdom 
which like to child house on the sand 
rear up in sport and toy will become 
a prey unto the wave that first approach 
they can perhaps judge well of meat and wine 
good table statesman soldier at a banquet 
strong to overcome a goblet or a charger 
but kingdom safety be not owe unto 
the palate and the stomach if that these 
be state affair your council be most find 
and every breast a synod if that music can now 
raise wall and city as of old 
your realm will be impregnable 

have thou yet do 
not all the ghost that I have make have be 
thus cruel to i nor as yet their grave 
have threat half these evil thy mother 
labour be a conception to these pain 
thou hourly bring upon i 

sir I be sorry it be my love my love 
that so do dictate to i my desire 
that your sport may follow one another 
and succeed so just that they may seem to 
bring the season on and not the season 
they that thus they may continue ever 
but it be that they may continue and not 
fall by treason but sir I will no more 
I shall hereafter think it more piety 
hand in hand to fall in peril with you 
than myself to bring they 

what will thou have 
the power I have be whole thou if that 
I never do deny be not think give 
now I do take all the mean thou can by 
law or majesty to remove thy fear 

sir I thank you humble thus low I thank you 
nor will I in a compliment return 
it back again till I have make you safe 
I shall go to work like a resolute 
but skilful surgeon that dare feel and search 
a wound and if he find dead flesh dare cut 
it off or more corruption will not spare 
a limb exeunt omnes 

may I hope to see such happiness 

to enjoy it hourly and to the end or I shall curse myself else 

it be the power of prince for to change 
the place the come in to a court but this 
lady bear such divinity about she 
that where she come she consecrate the place 
a temple methinks a sacred awe do 
fill the room result from her presence 
how happy be those time which see a king 
and council of the same bless temper 
inform with soul like she that know no vice 
but what they punish nor learn it further 
than the law and common place instruct 
in that great massacre I may rather say 
of virtue than of man all that flee not 
to this holy sanctuary be crush to nothing 

can I no way be a helper 

only with your prayer the man will overcome and the god who must with piety be conquer we will leave to your goodness but madam you must yet conceal your joy and not speak they with a look 

this be the hard task the first be so just and righteous that in itself it be both prayer and sacrifice 

there be but a few day now as I may true say to crown our labour our great care be how we shall provide for your grace before the time your stay here may be dangerous 

take no care for i my lord which way soever the fortune go I shall be safe from all but from myself 

madam the prince 

So fall the cloud from off the trojan lord 
not able to embrace such ray within 
but be pierce turn all at once to air 
and leave thin close as dazzle as the sun 

sure I be rude and barbarous before 
this soft fire do touch my heart and from 
the wild inhabitant of the wood differ 
in passion only and not reason that 
without more respect my dull eye can gaze 
upon such brightness and with a ready rudeness 
can excuse the fault commit 
the unhewn clown not falter with his tongue 
or in his look abash can answer to 
the emperor of the world when he that be 
better teach and near to the majesty 
that speak beat for a word and answer but 
with look although at other time his learned 
soul can dictate such as will be if that the god of 
wit his deity be call in question 
and force to show some excellent 
piece above all be ever write as the 
tenure by which he hold his godhead 
pardon that like the attendant of the 
altar thus by degree I come and pause 
at each step and bend unto that nearness 
rashness be my fault before and bring i 
into shame though no adoration 
yet there be a duty to be pay at 
your fair shrine 

sir it be not you but the rudeness of the court that will leave you to so unhappy a mistake 

if I will set a spectacle to the 
world it shall be such a close where beauty 
adore beauty and greatness bow to greatness 
methinks the heaven do open and the cloud 
be spin into a thread to let down some 
God unto this contract let we withdraw 
the power be now descend and all 
within be sacred and mysterious 
and if we do pry into these secret 
our curiosity will be punish 

this honourable admittance you have grant i shall hereafter be my only glory the sweet meditation that accompany my old age nor shall the much envy youth make i wish one day back to be partaker of their lesser pleasure when I shall call these great unto mind what cordial will it be when I can silent boast within myself my young day be grace by a princess the fair in the world so I may say 

o my lord when you talk thus though I be loath you do compel i to turn my face away 

I humble crave your pardon it be strange so much seriousness can produce such folly yet I have fair ground for what I say which most excellent show themselves in every part 

they show but to the fantasy there be no such beauty here it be borrow from your speech and fair esteem which thus I will pay you back again you be all that you have say and when I first see you so you do appear to i and I think to all the world the first sight promise all virtue and the next perform they nothing seem then so low in you as this passion 

what honour you have lay upon i I may bleed for but can purchase any like they nor return such back again there all must submit your gift as your beauty be excel but away vain word I will endeavour to grow strong in those virtue and not melt in the passion you have name I will set new law to all noble lover that shall make all their idle passion appear as fond unto themselves as other make they throw by their pen and with their sword to act those fiction nor dare to name nor think upon the saint they worship but when they have a offer some virtuous increase to bring they near thus be a love that be free to all none be injure by it Hymen torch burn bright by such flame and Vesta fire more last and more pure who can complain the want of beauty when any any that dare be good may adore any and she like her picture though she true look one way may seem to cast a gracious eye over all 

how his soul labour to soar above the pitch of honour 

how glad how much great shall I grow if I can promise to myself but one of those seem look from you 

my lord I have not hear you without admiration and wish I can bestow favour rich and lovely worthy your acceptance but see that I can I will strive to honour you not with peevish and womanish command but such as shall be worthy of your valour and make you yet more a prince the bravery you have show have not raise a vain passion in i but a confidence a noble confidence that all those virtue be not name by you but speak in you which thus I will show my lord my lord Aratus 
but I must leave you to a instructor it be fit for your sword and therefore above my power to utter shame not sir that I put a tutor to you you be but to ground with he you may build to what height you please Come my lord you must lay off all strangeness here and receive a noble helper whole bring both strength and honour to your cause 

I may stand amaze at the nobleness 
in you both but not at this agreement 
in you I know virtue be still a kin 
though the person be stranger they be in 
while this old puppy thus do sleep 
and do in vice as age grow deep 
benumb all these plant be nigh 
into a drowsy let bargie 
behold a noble branch appear 
as far from his manner as his year 

o shed thou then thy influence 
and we will return fresh beauty thence 

the fierce sweetness of his face 
present a rigour mix with grace 
and though there be a want of blood 
his worth will make his title good 
virtue so grow in so few year 
make he even such become their fear 

on then and make the sceptre be 
think but reserve not snatch from thou 

be all thing ready for the ceremony the crown and robe 

they be there be nothing want if the prince be come 

he be come now 

your grace be welcome but it may seem to a strange place and person what think you my lord be not you fall into the company of so many traitorous and lose man 

sir say not so you have not warrant though you rank yourself within the number the place and person rather appear to i as if there be some religion towards 

my lord you understand it right there be a religion towards and I may true say that this our private meeting and close counsel be more just and glorious than the loud deed in court that all our public act edict and form of law be dark and impious compare to it nay that this time and place make holy by our purpose have the god more manifest and present than the sacrifice and temple long since make void and empty of a deity by those which sue for favour and request for he who just here deserve their horrid vengeance we be not meet here to plot a general ruin for a private injury we know and teach the great Donne by the king unto the subject can not give he cause to throw off his faith king be petty god and may tempt we nor be it want or desire of innovation that thus stir we we be in the best ill state already nor ambition to strike at that laurel which the thunder spare no we reverence it and know that as man be the work of nature so king of Jove but it be our oath the sacrament we take which still hold we though our lord be dead until his successor do quit we from it by take of a new one we be not subject but slave to he we now obey and therefore as slave we ought to hate our master he be bear less than we and hide the private man under the public gown the purple which he wear be dip deep in the blood of innocent to colour it so but I vain waste myself in word here be no mind to be persuade nor ear to be instruct the sin we be to punish we all know and the god remember our strength then be all we be to speak of which be the great half of the isle 16 year undisturbed provision so careless be that provide for which be get by blood there be but one lordship small in respect of other the tyrant own possession that will stand strong for he but they be so besot with their fortune that their great aid will be but in their will to do he service they may offer up their life like so many sacrifice for his sake but not like soldier they be unworthy of that name they may die but never conquer war be never talk of but in their banquet nor dare they fight beyond a brawl 

and if we will count part of our strength in their weakness we have no opposition in the city where they and their vice be daily see nothing be too contemptible and in the remote part where majesty be no more reverence be know only by the power and law and where the name of king hear like the name of God even there those son of the earth as I may so call they dare menace at he and pile hill on hill to set their body equal to their hate 

here we be three can each of we raise such force which though they can not yet can make the kingdom fear a conquest

here let we all before the sacred witness of faith and perjury make a holy vow of loyalty to ourselves and cause and as we draw near to so divine a essence consider it be not gold or marble that we touch but a model of a sensible and live power which have vouchsafe to be embrace by one hand when the vastness of our thought can not comprehend it

they hold you in your safety nor be the distance betwixt your life and death long than this space that part we if you dare overtake i I will stay you out a day sail at sea I challenge you to a princely combat where come with all your power that I may destroy so many bruit beast from of the earth Exit Clearchus

do he help your lordship with ship that thus you plead his cause shall I be tutor by a traitor 

sir you be happy if you can find a tutor when you thus much need one and for your other language if I understand it I will give you a answer in the mean time it must return upon you 

well sir I shall find other way than word to answer you 

how now Timeus what bloody 

no more than you see sir the sword rather leave it on i then draw it out 

who be the traitor that dare attempt such outrage 

he have escape unknown 

unknown that can be when he have pass thus far in the court some must take notice of he can you describe he 

he be habit like a soldier but his look have more of devil than of man 

upon my life I see he but it be some two day since he must be know in all this time inquire who bring in any such man or be see with he 

this can be nobody but my hobgoblin an it please your grace be he not in a buff coat and his face all to be dabble with patch 

yes he be so 

then do I know he he belong to my lord Aratus there nobody dare speak to he but he he show his tooth at everybody else he have like to have bite i once 

Aratus do you hear they say he that commit this outrage belong to you 

to i sir he wrong i that think so I maintain none that dare commit such insolence 

my lord I see he with you 

who pray make i know the man 

a black stern soldier that follow you 

I fear I understand you now there be such a one do follow i but I never discover any disloyal spirit in he his outside it be true be as you describe not mould after the common frame of man but threaten more than any I have see yet it be but his outside that threaten so within he be gentle all a courtier to be wind and turn by the small courtesy I must confess if he be injure than he be proud and lordly storm rise within his look and thunder be in his voice 

and you know this how dare you turn such a wild beast lose into the court who have I meet and chance to have anger my fortune have be the same lay hand upon he you shall find that such a spirit lodge in my breast too and when it be stir will raise tempest as great we shall find other matter to examine you of through this seem neglect we do put on we can observe all your action and with a half and sleep eye see into your dark plot 

then the god send their aid or all be lose yet sir hear i speak the jealousy you have on i I shall not be able to clear but will leave they to the trial of my innocence and your favour yet sir to show you in this last accident how much I be guiltless I will relate unto you how first I meet the actor of it it be on that day I be employ on a honourable message from your majesty to the strange prince on the shore I find he have late escape a shipwreck and as great a danger on the land for he be assault by two villain that be in the same voyage with he but the cause of their hate himself he can not tell he have no acquaintance with they but in the ship but as he have before the wave so in this tempest too as I may call it he bear himself above and leave they both as calm as death upon the shore in the instant when he be yet hot in his anger and their blood we come upon he 

pray sir let i speak to you there be a wonder discover to i by his relation and under this monster he have speak of a great do lie hide one that you will rather have in chain than all the list of traitor I have name sir commit the uncase he to i and suffer i to free Aratus let it suffice I be a eye upon he and the rest and will sudden by their destruction destroy their plot 

take your way I will leave he to you 

my lord with the persuasion of your innocence I have procure your freedom of my father and do desire in requital of this kindness if it be such to let i see the face of this my enemy once more if your acquaintance as appear by your word be not too late to know his abode my lord I shall receive he otherwise than you expect the relation you have make of he and what myself be witness on have turn my hate into admiration and if I can move his love as I have do his anger I shall be happy in his valour it be no strange thing that the valour of enemy have make they friend and that wonder have be the first seal of love I do consider how much I injure he and that on such occasion he can not have do least at first sight I call he dog and without more circumstance command for to kill he 

now sir I must kneel to you you have the mercy of a prince he shall submit for his offence or suffer for it and if you find not that noble spirit in he I have tell you of in the most dangerous business you shall implory he let he be punish for this his ill place valour 

my lord I will take no other surety but your word ever engage i thus Exit Timeus 

but my lord though I can answer I can give credit to your smooth tongue this last accident have like to have break all and have there not be help above there have be none beneath I must be no more so venturous our conspiracy begin to be discover and that we be suspect be the least fear we must not long defer our break out there be no safety now but in a public danger Exit 

I be come to tell you the infection 
that cause this your retirement be now 
vanish and abroad you may easy bless 
they with your beauty it shame i to say this 
I can pronounce you may do something that 
may command all 
I ever as a servant do approach 
you but now as a offender as one 
that be guilty of a sin of so high 
a nature as this your sadness be can 
I do less than condemn myself that will 
have kill the man that will have do it yet 
I hope this my action have not make i 
appear to throw of that honourable name 
as servant to you it be a title I be most 
ambitious of and never do 
engage myself a more humble one 
then by my last command before I be 
a votary to your beauty now to 
your goodness there be no earthly thing I 
so much reverence if I may call that 
earthy that be so divine I bend but at 
two place the altar and your virtue 

my lord though your compliment be such as to esteem this my retirement for your sake so great a favour I must not so account it nor think I have lay so deep engagement on you in grant that I voluntary and unasked perform your respect may claim great service and your last word have be requital to a stranger 

there be a gentleman desire access unto your grace from prince Clearchus and my lord Aratus 

prithee go stay he within assoon as this trouble over I will come to he sure it be to warn i of their break out 
the time of their great birth be now complete 
the hour be finish o let it not you 
which look down which favourable look down 
upon this isle want your power which first 
do strengthen it let the same hand that hide 
disclose it too shame not at so glorious 
a offspring when it be heavenly and do 
confess the father when none but god dare 
call it there be nor without blasphemy can 
own it you be kind father at the first 
show yourself still so and breed the child you 
have get where humane strength shall fail there 
hold it up and make that want the strong 
yet when I look this way it do distract 
my prayer and make i wish a conquest 
without destruction of the enemy 
o it be pity that so much nobleness 
shall fall to earth although no love I can 
afford he tear 

why well say Timeus now I like thou here thy ear and service be bend the right way will I can see thou once look pale in these but thou be so worldly that thou appear still as if thou be it not in it can a young man when he may have leave to breathe in such a paradise as this draw a common air a air of the people madam I do think but you find he a rude servant one that pay his courtship as a business and not as a delight that have one eye upon the door to be go when the other be fix on you 

my lord I be never witness of any other courtship and therefore can compare it only with what I can imagine and it be above my high fantasy 

why do thou not answer I be ashamed to see thou oh my conscience at these year I can on it woo thou myself I think we have best change business neither will go forward else I will court for thou and thou shall rule for i thou will never get a wife without the help of a commission 

though nothing be more just than a noble 
love yet nothing ought to be more secret 
none be to be admit to the right 
of it but the god and the two party 
sir you be not acquaint with the law 
of a divine love that may imagine 
the progress of it a tedious pilgrimage 
and that they languish which do live in hope 
the mean be more delightful than the end 
then be the bloom and spring of joy when it 
be green as it grow ripe the blossom 
fall and turn to profit the perfection 
be the first decay of love there be a 
marriage of the soul precede the other 
in time and excellence and be perform 
by a Hymen of a more extract 
deity who torch be pure than the 
element of fire these be law unknown 
to your unfashioned Cupid who perhaps 
may wound a breast among those rude soul 
who think they ought to exchange heart for heart 
and love only in requital but here 
a nobleness must tip the shaft as well 
as goodness or else it peirce but to pity 

ha ha ha say thou so thou be kill in a philosophy I think thou have never dream of I be loath to put it out of thou with other thought but I think this business I be to tell thou of will confirm thou more and remove all thy jealousy the suspicion thou have of a treason be not in vain since it have break out but it be already cure the two chief of they be take in their passage as they go to raise commotion and I have command that they be set so as they may have a full view of that earth they be so ambitious of and then to strangle they at that height 

be there but two sir flatter not yourself have they be thousand they have yet leave more behind you account that a victory which they scorn to account a loss and think you be safe when they be not endanger be Aratus Phronimus or Eurylochus among they 

no nor suspect by any but yourself 
how now what be the matter 

sir yonder be two fellow we have lay hold on that call themselves messenger from Aratus to your majesty but they have behave themselves so traitorous that we have use they accord and clap bolt upon they till they shall be further determine of what their business be they will declare to none but to yourself and they have speak those thing which they be sure will bring they thither they answer when they be urge they come to defy the king and we and if they be not mad they be the most desperate villain I ere hear speak 

these be the evil I be a prophet of I see they when they be yet disguise 

where be they 

they be under guard here in the court there be a messenger too from the governor of the city desire admittance to your majesty he say a broad be many sign of tumult 

sir this be no time to delay if we believe not yet the next news will be bring we home by the traitor themselves you may perceive their strength and readiness in this that they dare make such bold declaration and in the open day produce their black plot if we haste not to overtake they now our great speed hereafter will not reach they 

madam we must entreat your pardon that thus we have offend against your quiet and make you the first witness of our trouble that ought to have know they last 

sir the trouble be too sad to be excuse 

our message you say be return again upon we 

in a manner the same word accompany only with a few threat more 

we expect no other yet it be fit to neglect no part that belong to the justice of our cause though it be but mere formal we ought to claim the right we have before we use the mean to conquer it the same circumstance be to be observe aswell in the court of war as in the court of law no trial till the demand be pass 

there be but one of the messenger return the other for his stout demand of the crown lose his head there his fellow report he deliver those word you put into he with such resolution that he appear not to denounce but bring those evil on he the tyrant grow pale and seem to feel they in his threat nor can he think himself safe encompass with his friend and guard till he have silence that voice that so can wound he through all their sword 

alas poor man yet he fall noble his sword may have purchase he a high name in war but not in honour in our day of triumph he shall not be forget nor his glory though he perceive it not be defend behind those that live 

do you hear the news my lord 

no my lord what be it 

all be lose 

bless we my lord how 

yet it may be but a rumor and scatter by the enemy Phronimus and Eurylochus in their convoy with the young king be take the camp be ready to mutiny on the report 

there can be such a evil it be a sin to give credit to it pray my lord relate some particular of the report be there any make mention of the king age 

no the rumour go that two lord be take on the way by a troop of horse of the adverse party the young king be in his disguise and not yet know past undiscovered as one of their follower 

o it be most likely 

where be all our great word now those 
mighty sound that make a tremble in the air 
and cause no less a deafness with their fall 
then if thunder the voice of heaven be turn 
articulate and speak the threat of Jove 
unto the world change to as great a silence 
such when a tempest cease be the calm 
that follow no noise be hear as if the 
wind with blast be breath less grow and the sea 
sit down and after so much toil require ease 
not able for to lift that from a rock 
who keel strike hell and mast the cloud do knock 
why have we not body equal to our mind 
that when we dare meet peril we may 
bear they too and not with a fade trunk 
lose thought invincible yet I will do 
something and where the god have give a will 
we ought not in their service to sit still Exit Pallantus 

my lord raise yourself the news may be false and all the danger they be in may be by this your belief give not yourself cause to mourn hereafter that all perishd on a mistake if that this the worst of evil be befall it ought not to be the reason of your neglect but great care and vigilance 

my lord I thank you and will take your advice pardon i that I be stupefy at the great amazement that can befall and appear dead when that the life of all my action be take from i yet it be not a slumber I be lose in but a confusion of various thought not know which to choose until you point i one out we will do something present and not give they leave to put their black intent in practice hark 

the soldier be in a mutiny 

Demophilus what news 

what news my lord 

such as be not to be name without a sacrifice o see my lord though we have lose we be not yet undo there be a relapse but not a total ruin of our fortune the king Phronimus and Eurylochus be all safe and never be in danger this night they will be here with their full power the occasion of the mistake be now plain 

till this fall out we have no sense of the happiness we be in pray my lord what be they which be take 

two that stand strong for our party more beside their name here and that they be virtuous I be not to instruct you you may perceive they which have no such cause of joy as we have do lament they much we shall have a time too to mourn their death then when we have leave to laugh at they which slay they in the mean time fare them well such a leave be I in their misfortune I will have expect they have only outstrip we in the payment of a debt we all owe unto our master we be due though not yet call for and how fare the young king 

as one the god take care on his word and look have gain many unto his party and put courage in all the rest 

and we will make use of it while it be yet hot after this night rest they shall give battle to the enemy hark the mutiny increase let we away lest we lose all here 

sir though there be trouble in your affair 
let none be in your countenance your eye 
shall like those bless twin fire upon the ship 
display a vigorous flame a light of joy 
and comfort round about that they which toil 
in the rage and fury of this tempest 
may from thence foresee a calm and nourish 
hope of safety thus you wrong your kingdom 
destroy it yourself cause other will 
the people groan just as you groan their pulse 
have the same motion and their heart do beat 
both hope or fear accord as you do 
either dilate or else contract it else 
all omen come from you your passion be not 
a single sadness it be your subject too 
when you confess a fear who dare behold 
they do account it a disloyalty to have a 
thought that shall run cross to you 
your mirth be now discretion and a face 
cheerful as at a feast be policy 
it will be one kind of succour 

why Timeus I thank thou but these joy come 
from above be not to be take 
when we please no man can resolve he will 
be happy yet I will struggle with my 
thought and endeavour to force that quiet 
they have take from i but let not this thing 
discomfort you it be but a course of humour 
perhaps a little physic will remove it 

now sir you put a new life into i 
and I dare say we shall be victorious 
nay we will no power do stand against we 
now that be favourable which attend upon 
your person to who protection I will leave you 
and go see how the camp fare 
shall I bear any of your command thither 

only my love the care of all thing else do thou take upon thou and tomorrow if this fit leave i before the battle I will visit you Exit timcus 
how every thing be irksome to i cloud 
and darkness be before my eye all thing 
dissent one from the other yet conspire 
in this that they present death to my view 
I have that idle comfort only that 
he that despair of all ought to fear nothing 
when thing can grow worse all fortune then 
be on his side that suffer but my injustice 
strengthen with murder do forbid success 
a kingdom get by blood be build upon 
a slippery foundation I have be 
nourish in peace thus long that be grow 
specious and great I may at last fall down 
a sacrifice worth slaughter thought urge thought 
suspicion get suspicion danger danger 
I have not that small settledness of mind 
as to think one thing twice be I but innocent 
I will provoke misfortune call for fate 
with as undaunted courage as the lord 
and ruler of it do 

stay 
what a nothing it be that I have thus much fear 
and labour to escape when it be my good 
childish dread every thought of cure 
then most offend when my health be near 
how well I be after this little wound 
quiet of mind and peace of conscience 
those bless companion do possess i now 
I see nothing but blood can appease blood 
in sacrifice that to the guilty there be 
no ease like death no mercy like the cross 
o o the king make sign of weakness and the guard make a offer to kill Pallantus 
hold in your rage have you not already 
act mischief enough by my command 
but thus you seek to pull more upon you 
you be deceive though I have be hitherto 
a tyrant now I be merciful and can 
command thing that be just and innocent

this my misery and you shall lay hand 
upon yourselves how ridiculous be this 
your rage suppose I shall give way to 
your desire what be you the safe 
or I the better you will have one foe 
the less and I one sin more that be already

rather I be not only guilty your 
hand be dip in the same blood and perform 
such thing I often dare but wish that you 
be command will not excuse you your 
loyalty to i be but at best a 
break faith unto another and when 
you observe it most you be most perjure 
what can you expect you see when that I 
be guard by a host need not fear 
what the power of earth or man can do 
unto i one man as I may say one 
handful of that earth break through they all and 
with a single arm force what a million 
can not keep and when there be no mean leave 
yet there be a miracle to conquer i 
to you I turn now no more my ternor 
in return of this favour you have find 
show the like to these and other that shall 
be guilty of that name as friend to i 
though you be nothing yet this deed 
will make you powerful and you that have give they all 
may demand so small a share now you have be 
so much my enemy change something 
to a friend how vain I take care for 
lesser thing neglect my great charge 
o my Timeus my poor Eudora 
leave i not yet my soul thou can not mount 
until the load be take from thy wing 
thou can inhabit here when it be hell 
now it be paradise oh stay and dwell

when I know it be just the malefactor 
penitence take not the justice of his 
doom a way though he be change that remain 
unstained he may die with pity but not 
with innocence they mind i not I will endeavour 
to escape while they be thus stupefy with grief 
I will not trust their obedience to a dead command Exit 

leave your sad embrace 
they will bring no comfort to you though you persist in they till you be such as thus you hold death like a coy mistress make no return of love for all that be bestow you may waste yourselves but not your sorrow here this ground will afford a perpetual supply of moisture which your eye like two sun may draw up and pour down for ever 
let we to the prince and to he 
offer up our life and grief together 
the one be the only medicine for the other 

the traitor be escape 

we be too soft to obey a die speech 

his escape be as strange as be his entrance 
we have power to hinder neither exeunt omnes 

give i a power mighty as my rage 
that my revenge may reach unto the cloud 
and unthrone those god that join hand with man 
to commit so black a deed it be but 
justice they shall lose their deity that 
so will throw it off o my father do 
I unload thy shoulder of the kingdom 
that thou may fall under a less weight 
and bereave thou of all thy jealousy to 
ruin thou with more assurance only 
where be all those flatter tongue that when 
there be no need will in a compliment 
hourly suffer for thou not one to die 
in thy defence or by his fall to make 
thy more decent how dismal be this place 
the grave where death inhabit be not so 
dreadful I will fly thou though I run among 
the thick of my foe they can present 
no danger like this loneness the cry the 
sword the trumpet in the battle strike not 
so deep amazement what ho Clitus 
Charisius Erastus Amanthes not one voice 
I walk like Aeneas among the shade 
all be hell about i I see nothing 
but what my fantasy frame in horrid shape 
oh the vain fear of guilty man all be 
unreasonable but you ridiculous 
when you have contemn the great power 
on earth threaten with strength and hatred 
you tremble at a ghost a thing less than be 
a man and when the substance can not the 
shadow fright you there be no way but this 
to set i above my fear when I be 
less I shall be equal to they 

o hold my lord offer not up yourself 
a sacrifice when there be so many 
that glad will relieve you with their life 
let that think prevail with you hat you ought 
to live for they that so willing will 
die for you you be the prop of thousand and 
if you fall you sink a kingdom with you 
take the sword by the other end and so 
hold it seek to appease this sacred 
ghost such a will exceed this performance 
if you can it confirm the crown yet confirm 
your memory by the loss of it this 
object make your grief a burden to your 
honour lean on i my lord I will bear you 
to the camp exeunt omnes 

what shout be that among the enemy 

it be the acclamation of the camp at the receive of their fellow this night they expect their other force and it seem they be now arrive 

I be glad on it I hope we shall have command to try the fortune of the field tomorrow will the whole knot of they be there that we may make quick work and like Alexander untie it with a blow 

ay and a wall round about they to keep they to the slaughter that we may not be trouble to kill a thousand in a thousand place I do like this pursue it be the great evil next to the be pursue the wine near taste well when it be so jumble give i a stand camp that flourish like a peaceful city and want no necessary here stand your engine there your beef on this hand a palesado defend you on the other a baracado of porktub impregnable before a ditch be cut of some two hundred pace and the soldier tipple in it behind a coop run out of the same length and the poultry tipple in their trench who body be too delicate and tender for bare travel here a man may even among the tent forget to be a soldier 

ha ha ha 

o my conscience Comastes thou be weary of the camp already 

yes faith as yourselves be if you will confess the truth 

why methinks there be no pleasure to be compare with it every man have his delight here as if he take his leave on they and if he chance to return at night like friend which part in the morn two dangerous and hopeless way of ever see they meet with a multiply and unexpected joy these very wound be pleasure and Elysium come fast on they then their death 

when honour be the prize and wrong justice 
the cause that thrust they on they throw of one 
that they may get a better life a life 
of fame which be eternal even on earth 
that they enjoy before be fade 
sustain only by the infirmity 
of one weak body now it be support 
by the memory of all the charge of it 
be commit unto a world of man 
nor be it extinguish before the fame of the 
whole universe none be so survive 
as the son of glorious war Jove give 
life to Hercules and Theseus but mar 
eternity they breathe from one but gain 
heaven by the other these be the great thought 
which when I be yet young and not able 
to embrace they do dwell in i they do 
suggest unto my soul that I ought to raise my hand 
against the god if they sleep 
at perjury and favour injustice 

Holloe what ail thou 

what mean thou Comastes 

to show you how easy a thing it be to talk like a soldier and be as brave a fellow as either of you 

ha ha ha

what will thou say now Comastes to a jovial round or two beyond the court health those at the king own table 

I think I shall say more than you at this as well as in the other 

captain prithee command they to bring some wine in come let we sit in the mean time and take away these fearful thing from Comastes he bid they remove the armour off the table 

and why from i i I pray 

why they will fright thy mirth away look it gape upon thou but will bite 

no more than your lordship sword be this the terrible thing I know not what it may do in a dark night with a candle in it but in the day and your lordship look through it I shall never turn my back unless it be to laugh pray God the enemy think of no such stratagem with a pitcher in the progeneralship it may be as much as the king army lie on

if we must let we to it stout and like soldier what say you shall we drink a battle the trial of to morrow victory I will take the king part against you all I be the strong and when I have overcome I will send he word of the good omen it be worth a thousand of your paltry bird and ox entrails it be a piece of service will gain the favour from you all 

Come we will undertake you begin that honour belong to your side one bring Comastes a cup

o while you live begin with your light armature the legionary follow 

Is that the trick on it here then for the king I throw the first reed this boy can manage no great weapon 

I marry there stand a rank of lusty fellow a man may rely upon such valour their very look will overcome common stomach I long to see they buckle to it this be too much sport 

reach they down then 

give it i and find a assault Pallas and victory for the king why I this be a tall fellow I do it think but Alexander have always a guard of such attend on his person he have a dozen of they and call they my twelve labour 
o for a shout a little noise will gain the conquest 

in good time but not so easy

hold up Comastes for the greatness of your cause hold up you show sign of faint how now 

hah go thy way never a goblet the king have ere get the honour to struggle so long with i 

I fear we must lose in loyalty you will never overcome else 

I warrant you I retire but to a ambush but who keep the door all this while Say the enemy shall come and cut all our throat I can tell you I have read such pretty story 

how now Comastes what word be these do wine breed fear in you 

a pox on this war it will be my undo I shall come out with some such roguish question or other at the king table and have my bone break by the guard

o the heavy hand of justice be the prince safe 

slay too if report be true but by what hand I know not he leave the king just before his fall to come hither and be that he be not here we have much cause to fear the worst 

fear not now you have pass the great danger when we have make a end of these there be none leave to punish we the king and prince be kill and those which remain we do the business for and will reward we rich accord to the service and their great promise we have no other way to gain aught by this alteration our pardon all that we can hope for if we still let we on present lest some other do prevent we follow i I will give the first blow 

how now what gaze you at know you where you be do your foot lead you without the council of your head get you to your quarter or I will stretch you up in it 

these villain dare do any thing captain follow they and see they punish Exit captain 

I be for the last it be the safe way and in our grief the noble 

sir these fellow come to kill we one of the weak on they when he see himself lay hold on for his other fault suspect he be discover out of mere guiltiness confess that unwilling he be bring into the plot by the persuasion of his fellow who in hope of preferment from the enemy have decree on all our death he say too that himself and many more be attempt by some of the adverse party with promise and threat to lay down their arm and that the camp be full of such commotor 

This then will confirm our former resolution come let we number up ourselves and if we be equal each man set his sword against his fellow breast and with a friendly wound in spite of fate or fortune be ourselves lord of a great power give happiness to either then these wild beast will deplore the loss of that they so endeavour to throw away and leap like headless body into flame and ruin 

o my lord let we embrace you with such a love as dead and revive friend will express to either to we you be dead and be alive again and have bestow this life we now enjoy we must not owe it to another parent So be the judge a father to the guilty your sentence be pass upon we and the hand hold up to put it into practice when you as if from heaven you have fall set all right that be in such confusion what trifle will the great danger appear to we 

rise you have no less quicken i that be as nigh my end as you yourselves be but now I live and again can think of life and vengeance to our enemy which present we will put in practice and see that our spirit be redouble our loss shall no long fright we 

it be time sir you show yourself unto the army there you be dead still and their faith on the belief little better but your presence will enliven it again and make they fight on hatred of their former fault and shame of their present desperation 

let we away 

never do justice appear so eminent this be a deed as if her own hand have wrought it who can complain the want of providence or say the guilty and the innocent make one heap when this be tell a tyrant in the height of all his glory guard with friend and cruelty what either power or violence can make he safe with by a mortal hand strengthen with justice be snatch from the midst of all the lightning melt not the enclose gold with half that wonder leave that be more combustible nor do the plague in a multitude of man make a choice so curious 

where be the great worker of it 

again depart to perform great thing if be possible I do prophesy though not the nature of they that he can act we wonder we will strive to second his first blow and now the god and he have do play our part I can almost give he divine honour and say when he be in the camp there be no need of any other power soldier be but charge and trouble only 

it be time that my troop be go that we may reach the place of ambush ere the break of day 

it be true you shall present away Phronimus be already go with his force to stop the passage between the enemy and the city we in front will stand against they so that in the morning when they rise it shall appear to they as if they be inhabit with foe not be able to turn away they shall not lose their sight in our large number 

some of those which be send to corrupt the enemy be return and say their word be hearken to beyond their expectation and if a present assault be give there be no doubt of victory all be in such a tumult 

such evil increase by delay we will let they grow until the morning and then our sight will gain the conquest if it be possible we will order it so that we may rather show they war than bring it on they though they be give into our hand we ought not to show our mercy and not our power

the guard at your command and shall stay only for your safety Exit pallanius 

soldier thou be noble may the god reward thy goodness madam you have best go in 

fortune glory victory all be flee 
unto their several habitation 
and have leave dishonour loss danger 
in their stead not so much praise to all our 
dead story as that we lose one man to 
save a kingdom not bleed a drop for the 
whole body safety 

my lord let not the treachery of such villain trouble you more than your thought of safety show your hate unto their falsehood by seek to revenge it you have yet hope leave if timely you put your former resolution into practice when we have gain the fort there be mean to escape the isle and seek foreign aid you have many friend that you may trust too this our obscure flight will make our return more glorious which shall be in the face of the whole kingdom nor will we choose another way but what pass over city army and through a general ruin to our revenge 

this quiet we enjoy do strike amazement in i sure they have slay the body with the head which make this general calm 

madam it be more innocent I have news bring by one I send to learn that do astonish i that the people know no cause of grief or gladness but rise to their affair as in a time when neither enemy nor holiday do distract they from their labour the king death be news this morning in the city such care the victor take least the many head but unbrained multitude shall pull a slaughter on they 

their piety be too late nor will it satisfy the god when they have spill so much blood that they will spill no more 

the soldier though their charge be go keep their guard still they of the party dare not disclose it for their own safety some there be which whisper it but they seem rather curious in the state than those dull which know it not 

can a kingdom fall and the ruin not wake the people 

the messenger with this doubt what he have see and hear nor dare he be confirm lest his question may seem treason the first open of it be by proclamation with such secrecy the plot be carry that now it be a labour to discover it after this Aratus and the rest of the conspire go into the marketplace where the people be command to attend by public voice and there to the assembly when they have declare the justice of their action they produce the young prince which in the last alteration of the state be lose but by all suppose to have be murder which that he be the king son be confirm by Aratus his confer the kingdom on he himself be the next heir unto the crown if the king issue fail the story of the prince life breed much love and pity and his look be able to have lead they to a civil war have he be counterfeit 

this may be true they who can believe there be a providence may easy give credit to this justice our sin be mighty than our suffering and have we a great debt than life we ought to pay it my misery be due to i I be a party and enjoy my father violence 

madam you be as innocent as at that time your age be and only do offend in your tear and too much love which on this occasion spend excessive be not to grieve but to repine the king be old and take his late leave and be hasten only a little soon to show the justice of the god it be true my lord Timeus be young yet have no patent for his life but as all brother be a uncertain joy 

how ill these word become thou and i to hear think thou my father fault can bring a comfort to i 

madam it will be no glory to you that a unworthy grief shall be your death your enemy no doubt be noble sure they choose the cruel to execute their business and he though his churlish outside promise not we find more courteous than they which do profess it his word be the law of compliment one that sympathize in all your suffering and though his manliness will not suffer he faint he die together with you 

see who it be disturb we who be it Rodia go out and return 

madam I know not nor do I ere see any like he his beauty beyond all similitude he speak like the soldier we be talk of but he it can be he be the terror this the darling of mankind 

whether will thou lose thyself in commendation in man beauty the least part 

madam it appear so in he yet such feature lay a necessity of nobleness on the mind he humble crave admittance nor will he take it before that it be grant 

call he in we must endure their pleasure it will not become our state to deny command much less when they entreat 

the kingdom owe a sacrifice for your life all will joy to hear it which have it fail will have pull more guilt upon we than the sin of a whole age 

it be my fault you tell i of and a great share of my grief that thus I stay to grieve 

my offensive tongue can utter nothing please to you so great be your misfortune and your honour so tender to you the wound that I have give you be beyond my cure 

thou be not he that give they 

if my repentance can make i clear I be not otherways it be I that partial hear my own cause believe and judge for it that hasty without examine what I do decree on all your woe

nothing so strange as my hope be at first they do appear in a divine and holy form beyond all that I can fantasy such a mind though ravishd with the beauty can not express then and promise all shall be as heavenly as their shape call i the instrument of justice the saver of my country set all the sin before i I be to punish tell i there be no heaven but what their cloud do veil thus they creep into i and win i with the most specious show unto their service on my bare resolution give i part of that happiness I be to aim at then they clothe i in a body foul as the tragedy I be to act and make i dote on those deformity which all do loathe when they have bewitch i with these false yet glitter name and I obey their black command in a moment they change into repentance a mournful figure and sad leave i as they first do find i and as I now appear to you 

thou have no cause for all that thou have do the fault be general and concern not thou but thou be ready for all ill as well as goodness 

yet I have a cause pardon i that I say and be that I see not you before I do it a just one I lose a sovereign as near to i in blood as love and if this cause may seem remote I have a father murder who death as it become you thus to mourn so it do i for to revenge myself be banish loyalty be both our fault and when they have heap these sorrow on i leave i not one hope to lean on they be not yet content with my despair but seek my life which be so poor it can not be distinguish then from death their injury force a new one in i and blow the spark until the flame consume they but have I behold you before their danger it will have turn my soul within i change i from a foe unto their party I can now believe I have a justice that there can be anywhere you be injure in it so much my love do mount above my grief that it make i think I have only lose your father why weep you thus can that recall he I will bear you company and break those stubborn gate which from my childhood to this present hour have keep they back and spend my whole store here but nothing can redeem he let that common remedy which all apply and help all give ease unto you that nothing can redeem he o learn a strength of i that be the worst name for it to bear a father loss let the innocence of my excuse my violence to you we be the wretched two alive make so by ourselves and can be only happy in ourselves

pardon if my much love make i a rude 
brother and too credulous soon I 
proud call myself by that honourable 
name when so late I have leave to do it 
yet have it not be before declare 
unto i I can not so easy 
consent to the belief your face before 
do joy i but then a angel wear it 
and appear more heavenly in your borrow 
shape than in his own I can blame the 
trouble of my former life when I be 
bar from such felicity as these 

the god be not so favourable to i 
as in a dream faint and afar off 
to show the blessing I be to hope how 
glad i will have change my great joy 
for such your trouble this I may call my 
birthday I walk and breathe and speak before 
but live not till this hour I have a be 
then but not a life till now 

it be so to both of we and we will ever celebrate it as the first day that we be bear brother and sister before we be stranger now we be twin of love my lord I understand the holy league betwixt you and though I lie my hand thus on it I intend not for to break it nor make a divorce though thus I part you pardon i that I seem covetous of so great a happiness and show a loathness to part from it before I have myself enjoy it she must sit some time my queen before she be crown you 

it be a cruelty to wish it other I will not be guilty of such desire if after a brother I a humble servant shall be think on it be the time and place I be ambitious off I will withdraw sir and though there be no happiness I can enjoy so great as behold you I will deny myself the view 

o my lord say not so though I be kind I be not fond I will give up my interest or any thing rather than you shall leave we I speak it as a mean to stay you make it not then a part word help i to persuade he 

my lord 

it be enough I obey my business be much below my love and I will rather destroy the one then offend the other yet now I have grant I will entreat again as for a new favour I may persuade though deny nothing my voyage be bind to another place before happy I be cast upon this shore and though I call myself a prince I be a servant to my employment and obey the commission of a father the expense and expectation of a kingdom 

my lord if your employment be so great we will not make you guilty of a dishonourable stay 

if with your leaf I shall depart as a man that be pull from his delight with a strong hand be free recoil again to they so speedy shall be my return and in my absence account all violence that do detain i by that time too your first trouble will be settle and you more fit to receive a idleman 

our passion ought to give way unto your reason 

Aratus you be in a maze 

hah I must confess I be so these prince play their part so rare that there be nothing leave for we but wonder 

my lord shall we entreat you to bear we company unto the temple thither we be a go to give that perfection to our joy which yet be want and for unusual benefit offer unusual thank 

sir I humble crave your pardon that thus tardy after the people and your enemy I present my service to you and wish you happiness 

I can be deceive thou must be my Pallantus there be none can speak or look like thou thy least resemblance be above all man it be no wonder to see thou change thy deed have thus transform thou it sit upon thy brow and cast a glory round about thy face 

methinks the time have such a vizor on and till this day show not a true face sir you shall see he each day make new discovery of virtue 

my lord you promise too high for i 

thou look sad after all thy honour 

so methinks what can be the cause a king they say the best physician for a discontent if I can bring you comfort I sacrifice in your behalf 

sir I bow to you but that which be my grief will be no long mine alone then while I do conceal it all that hear will also have their share in it it be a disease that good man catch mere by the fantasy justice can never yet with all her care so carve out her punishment but that the innocent be wound with the blow and feel the judgement of another sin while with her sword she cut off the offend parent the child be make a orphan in the cradle and mourn hereafter because he have no fault 

whether do this sad beginning tend 

to this sir as we have slay withal religion a bloody tyrant one that be great in his sin then in the kingdom he purchase by they so too we have causeless slay the father of a lady that know not so much guilt as to satisfy she why she lose he for want of who life she now contemn her own a jewel of inestimable value with all that do behold it but herself sir you can call she a enemy though her goodness have stand against you and preserve her father so many year in spite of all his sin she ought to resist all piety if it be a enemy to her own 

her cause of grief be mighty and if care be not take as their fault have do the rest her goodness will destroy she we that behold the past deformity can bear witness of her virtue she be the only mine of honour and when we have be weary in seek one grain in she we can find a treasure nor waste a beauty set of only with the blemish of other or foil by general vice but a real and a native excellence which as it can not be obscure with thick darkness so neither can it be outshine by other light 

her grief concern we all and ought to be consider before our joy bear these tear to she we wish the excess of we may lessen she and say that comfort which be leave we will preserve and careful offer to she her brother with many of her friend be flee unto the fort and be there shut up will I can give they life what say you my lord may I do this be not mercy in this place folly 

sir it be so at no time you may do this or any thing you have a mind too even in your fantasy there be a secret council and see that all your action nay all your pleasure be in some exercise of virtue we will not cross you but make it our great care to preserve you in they and have a more diligent eye lest your pity may prove cruel to yourself 

you have give i resolution have present unto they it be their desire this morning to have conference with one of note and if you find they fit for mercy or to be make fit offer to they exeunt omnes 

no answer yet return 

not yet sir 

one look out again Exit Cap 
Polyander I remember I hear thou once say when I condemn thou for thy smile that if I have a cause thou will frown why look thou sad then our fortune ought rather to stir our anger than our grief 

be they sir my misfortune alone and not you I will not now fall below my word the great shall not move any affection in i unless it be some glory 

there be now one arrive sir who certain have bring we news 

let we seat ourselves before he enter that he may see on what strength we do demand every man put on a face of mirth now we be at a banquet that will refresh we after all our toil 

now retire but on the least call be ready for to enter 

who be this do any of you know he 

not I my lord 

sir you be welcome but we invite you only to look on these cate be not easy of digestion the god give not life more certain than this give death do you think you can endure the sight will Aratus himself be here that once he may be satisfy with a spectacle of blood you look pale on we already sure they have a plot upon you and send you hither to see your death have they none to send we to behold our resolution but such a trifle 

what shape can I put on and thou not injure i in it I never yet appear to thou in any form but that I suffer by thou at first I be thy fear as all that be innocent do fright thou because thou be guilty I be banish not to remove i but my death which with treachery thou seek and when I have with wonder escape thy intend mischief by chance thou will have slay i when thou have no cause of hatred my disguise wrong thou not it be as much a strange to thou as a inhabitant of remote Africa 

I know thou now thou need not further declare thyself and thou be come past all my wish to satisfy my revenge 

hold I come to bring peace and not destruction do you yet perceive how vain be all your malice 

if thou be that man thou will seem to be and equal with i do honour a dead father yet set by these helper let we single try our hatred the grant of this will please above all our demand I have rather see thou dead or by this mean not see thou live then again be master of the fortune I have lose I be unfit for life I shall but curse the giver of it 

if I think so I will grant to your request and kill you I can do it I have strength and justice enough to make i able but you be not so bad as you suppose these be despair and not malicious thought yet ere I go one way or other I will give you satisfaction I come for that intent let i see your article 
and if these may not be grant that thus accompany we may depart the isle how poor be these request without more commission I dare grant you great why these be demand within the compass of a subject breast deceive not yourselves you be not so safe in your own reign as in your enemy the state be not translate from one tyranny to another but to a kingdom a prince govern now which be the name of mercy as well as power which he true know and in his first deed desire to show on you he do not think he be then like jove when he can thunder but when he can hold it in not when he be the voice of death but when he sit harmless with the power of death about he revenge torment execution be not expression of a king but a destruction he rival not the immortal power in temple statue adoration but transcendent virtue divine performance these be the addition by which he climb heaven and appear a god on earth 

why shall I be a stranger to these virtue more than this man I be not bear for less thing than he certain when nature make this frame she intend it for the noble action 

have you yet resolve on any thing 

if you will go on I can hear you still 

I will go on in mercy it be my commission and if you will not dam against its stream it may flow to you yet the way be even why look you strange at the word it be no wonder to the sender of it nor they which live about he though the danger may seem great it be not worthy of the high name of his mercy if the offence be not such this be but the least of his expression that his enemy be court for to live but present you think it be not to save you but to defer your death a vain thought when can it be do more safe and more just you be now as far from those to help you as to pity you none but himself have any care of you it be true there be a lady that have a share in you but with your honour you throw she off nor can you claim a interest when you have neglect she in all her misery not in your flight your article no not in your thought provide for she And have she not fall into the hand of enemy that be servant too to honour you have throw away a jewel that have a first think even among the god 

o sir you have undermine my pride and remove i from that advantage ground I stand on to my own low height these your last word come near unto i and make i with reverence believe all that you have speak before your virtue only stir my hate and envy this deed first teach i to admire and can doubt there be a want of any nobleness when you have show such passionate care in preserve a distress virgin who I dare not think of lest I shall think too of her dishonour 

sir keep in your joy we do not think ourselves such high deserver in do that which barbarous people will have do they which will have burn the temple will have kneel to she and what duty they neglect to the altar will have pay at her foot think you we can desire to save such enemy as you and not adore a enemy of her virtue 

give i not scorn and honour in the same breath you have make i leave myself hate i not now I be nothing 

now I meet you and first give i leave with this to throw away all danger that do threaten you 
next my request be if you dare trust i to leave this place and present go with i whether I shall lead you 

I breathe be warm all alive the sun shine too I have not hear of any of his ray in the other world it be earth I tread on at least if I be not mount high and yet I hope I be not in heaven for let they say what they will it be to be dead to be there and I like not the society though they be angel what do I see I begin to misdoubt I do behold some such shape here face heavenly and the divine or else my fantasy abuse i if I be alive and on the earth then there be poison in that cup a pox oh my curiosity he take it and taste a little of the bottom what need I have care whether I have be so long as I find myself well I shall have get fearful honour if I have drink my share by this I see it be not a dream nor swoon I be in but all true story I do not think before it have be in the power of all the king in the world to have give i life when I be yet live but these thought shall pass and now I will look before i present I will to the new court and though the king be change not despair to be the same man

sir there be much joy in they which the softness of your word and not my grief cause to flow from i 

fame thou speak loud of these lady and yet thy voice be narrow in their praise 

I have pass hitherto and perceive no great alteration I think the subversion of a state will have make such a clatter among the house and there be no such matter it have not change a suit of hang here yonder be our princess too I be among friend now fortune direct i which be the king the least change that ever I see nay then I perceive I may do even what I list Aratus spy he 

my lord Comastes 

your servant my lord I hope you have forget all those little unkindness that pass betwixt we and will speak a noble word in my behalf unto the young king 

ha ha ha will thou be fool again 

no my lord you know I be never call so in the last reign 

ha ha ha why I tell thou the king be too serious he never laugh nor smile but very seldom and then it be still at something excellent he hate a jest look twice he have cast his eye upon thou and yet keep his countenance despair of ever please he there be no mirth that thou can make worthy to be compare with this thy misery 

my lord who be that 

one sir that be master of the dead king mirth he never laugh without his allowance it be in his power to have jest any head off in the whole kingdom but I think he be never guilty of any other sin but luxury 

what do he expect 

to hold the same place under you 

sir we understand you and your desire go leave the court upon your life be not see in it after this day and look hereafter wary to your action if you deserve a light judgement you shall feel the heavy 

stay my lord you have doom he as if you have be witness of his folly and if there be not hope that he may redeem hereafter what he have so ill spend he do deserve a great punishment I beseech you sir let i entreat for he he be yet young and if he have leave may be virtuous continue as you have begin to change the man and not destroy they he thrust himself with confidence on your mercy let it not be say that be a snare to any beside you have make this place a sanctuary to all those who can claim a interest in that excellent lady 

my lord I will be ever teach thus by you sir I recall what I have say and wish to see those virtue we see in you 

I will not despair to be master of they Com kneel it be the desire of favour with my king that make i what I be before and shame now for to remember but see I be to please another way and make virtue my endeavour unwearied in those ragged way I will toil to gain your smile 

my lord do still intend to leave we so sudden as tomorrow if I dare presume so much of your ill entertainment I will persuade you to a long stay 

sir I have find a royal welcome such as can be better but by your own wish which be the only thing above your action yet ere I go I have a request to you but it be such as I must not receive unless another will be content to ask it for i you be the man my lord and your company I desire which if I can obtain I dare promise to myself a victorious enterprise 

sir you much honour i and entreat i to that I be most ambitious of my will I free offer but the great part be whole devote to your service sir and none beside aught to dispose of it 

I thus give it with the rest by this request my lord I perceive you will keep your word and sudden return you will not else at once bereave we of yourself and so near a servant 

how glad I will think myself so much concern as to ask a leave of you but I have ever make myself a stranger to you or what be worse a know enemy and can expect only ill wish from you 

sir I think not so you have deserve better from i and if I give you not a leave it be because I be loath to have you go it be you confirm my life when I think it not in the power of art or heaven to have do it and that before I make not these large expression it be because they then become i not if I have owe less I will have say more 

you have give i a happiness which neither envy malice nor the worst of fortune can take from i I stand the only man above the stroke of fate may I hope to see that joy dwell in your face again which I be never yet so bless as to behold
