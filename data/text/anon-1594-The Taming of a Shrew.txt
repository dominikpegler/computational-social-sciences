why be not her father will to the match 

yes trust i but he have solemn swear 
his elder daughter first shall be espouse 
before he grant his young leave to love

and for his person worth as good as she 
and if he compass she to be his wife 
then may we free visit both our love 

o may I see the centre of my soul

Come fair Emelia my lovely love

wily Prometheus sly steal from jove 
infuse breath life motion soul 
to every object strike by thy eye 
o fair Emelia I pine for thou 
and either must enjoy thy love or die 

fie man I know you will not die for love 
ah Polidor thou need not to complain 
eternal heaven soon be dissolve 
and all that pierce Phoebus silver eye 
before such hap befall to Polidor 

thank fair Emelia for these sweet word 
but what say Phylena to her friend 

why I be buy merchandise of he 

mistress you shall not need to buy of i 
for when I cross the bubble canibey 
and sail along the crystal Hellespont 
I fill my coffer of the wealthy mine 
where I do cause million of labour moor 
to undermine the cavern of the earth 
to seek for strange and new find precious stone 
and dive into the sea to gather pearl 
as fair as Juno offer Priam son 
and you shall take your liberal choice of all 

I thank you sir and will Phylena may 
in any courtesy requite you so

how now daughter be Ferando come

I warrant you he will not be long away 

go daughter get you in and bid your 
sister provide herself against that we do come 
and see you go to church along with we 
I marvel that Ferando come not away 

his tailor it may be have be too slack 
in his apparel which he mean to wear 
for no question but some fantastic suit 
he be determine to wear today 
and rich powder with precious stone 
spot with liquid gold thick set with pearl 
and such he mean shall be his wedding suit 

I care not I what cost he do bestow 
in gold or silk so he himself be here 
for I have rather lose a thousand crown 
then that he shall deceive we here to day 
but soft I think I see he come 

godmorow father Polidor well meet 
you wonder I know that I have stay so long 

I marry son we be almost persuade 
that we shall scarce have have our bridegroom here 
but say why be thou thus base attire 

thus rich father you shall have say 
for when my wife and I be marry once 
she be such a shrew if we shall once fall out 
she will pull my costly suit over my ear 
and therefore be I thus attire awhile 
for many thing I tell you be in my head 
and none must know thereof but Kate and I 
for we shall live like lamb and lion sure 
nor lamb to lion never be so tame 
if once they lie within the lion paw 
as Kate to i if we be marry once 
and therefore come let we to church present 

fie Ferando not thus attire for shame 
come to my chamber and there suit thyself 
of twenty suit that I do never be 

tush Polidor I have as many suit 
fantastic make to fit my humour so 
as any in Athens and as rich wrought 
as be the massy robe that late adorn 
the stately legate of the persian king 
and this from they have I make choice to wear 

I prithee Ferando let i entreat 
before thou ghost unto the church with we 
to put some other suit upon thy back 

not for the world if I may gain it so 
and therefore take i thus or not at all 
but soft see where my Kate do come 
I must salute she how fare my lovely Kate 
what be thou ready shall we go to church 

not I with one so mad so base tire 
to marry such a filthy slavish groom 
that as it seem sometime be from his wit 
or else he will not thus have come to we 

tush Kate these word add great love in i 
and make i think thou fair then before 
sweet Kate the lovely than Diana purple robe 
white than be the snowy Apenis 
or icy hair that grow on Boreas chin 
father I swear by ibis golden beak 
more fair and radiant be my bony Kate 
than silver Xanthus when he do embrace 
the ruddy Simies at Ida foot 
and care not thou sweet Kate how I be clad 
thou shall have garment wrought of median silk 
enchase with precious jewel fetch from far 
by italian merchant that with Russian stem 
plough up huge sorrow in the terren main 
and better far my lovely Kate shall wear 
then come sweet love and let we to the church 
for this I swear shall be my wedding suit 

Come gentleman go along with we

to leave fair Athens and to range the world 

shall thou assay to scale the seat of love 
mount the subtle airy region 
or be snatch up as erst be Ganymede 
love shall give wing unto my swift desire 
and prune my thought that I will follow thou 
or fall and perish as do Icarus 

sweet resolve fair Emelia 
but will Phylema say as much to i 
if I shall ask a question now of thou 
what if the duke of cestus only son 
which come with i unto your father house 
shall seek to get Philema love from i 
and make thou duchess of that stately town 
will thou not then forsake i for his love 

not for great neptune no nor jove himself 
will Phylema leave Aurelius love 
can he install i empress of the world 
or make i queen and guideress of the heaven 
yet will I not exchange thy love for he 
thy company be poor Philema heaven 
and without thou heaven be hell to i 

and shall my love as erst do Hercules 
attempt to pass the burn vault of hell 
I will with piteous look and please word 
as once do Orpheus with his harmony 
and ravish sound of his melodious harp 
entreat grim Pluto and of he obtain 
that thou may go and safe return again 

and shall my love as erst Leander do 
attempt to swim the boil hellespont 
for Heros love no tower of brass shall hold 
but I will follow thou through those rage flood 
with lock dishever and my breast all bare 
with bend knee upon Abidas shore 
I will with smoky sigh and brinish tear 
importune Neptune and the watery god 
to send a guard of silver scale dolphin 
with sound Triton to be our convoy 
and to transport we safe unto the shore 
while I will hang about thy lovely neck 
redouble kiss on kiss upon thy cheek 
and with our pastime still the swell wave 

shall Polidor as great Achilles do 
only employ himself to follow arm 
like to the warlike amazonian queen 
Pentheselea Hector paramour 
who foil the bloody Pyrrhus murderous greek 
I will thrust myself among the thick throng 
and with my utmost force assist my love 

let Eole storm be mild and quiet thou 
let Neptune swell be Aurelius calm and please 
I care not I betide what may betide 
let fate and fortune do the worst they can 
I reck they not they not discord with i 
while that my love and I do well agree

gaze upon the giant Andromede 
sweet Kate entertain this lovely woman 

I think the man be mad he call i a woman 

fair lovely lady bright and crystalline 
bewteous and stately as the eyetrained bird 
as glorious as the morning wash with dew 
within who eye she take her dawn beam 
and golden summer sleep upon thy cheek 
wrap up thy radiation in some cloud 
lest that thy beauty make this stately town 
inhabitable like the burn zone 
with sweet reflection of thy lovely face 

what be she mad to or be my shape transform 
that both of they persuade i I be a woman 
but they be mad sure and therefore I will begone 
and leave their company for fear of harm 
and unto Athens haste to seek my son

where all the element be orderless 
before the great commander of the world 
the king of king the glorious god of heaven

and make all thing to stand in perfect course 
then to his image he do make a man 
old Adam and from his side asleep 
a rib be take of which the lord do make 
the woe of man so term by Adam then 
woman for that by she come sin to we 
and for her sin be Adam doom to die 
as Sara to her husband so shall we 
obey they love they keep and nourish they 
if they by any mean do want our help 
lay our hand under their foot to tread 
if that by that we may procure there ease 
and for a precedent I will first begin 
and lay my hand under my husband foot 

enough sweet the wager thou have win 
and they I be sure can deny the same
