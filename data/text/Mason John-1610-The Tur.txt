how sweet be thing know in their contrary 
when only apprehension and sick thought 
foster a greedy longing Amada 

madam you breath no covetous hand 
take the air from you no contrariety 
bandy against your rest as I be modest 
my father seem harsh ungentleness 
be but a misty policy to be guile some time 
then be yourself and jomiall 

yet why shall I repine 
at this my foret restraint of liberty 
our life be but a sail to our death 
through the world ocean it make no matter then 
whether we put into the world vast sea 
ship in a pinnace or a argosy 

no matter when we hope for change of vessel lady 
and in that hope beguile your passion 
give your sight freedom over the city wall 
and see what worthy object meet your eye 
see where two duke each like a god of war 
lie both entrench against the gate of Florence 
to gain your love on the west side there be 
Ferrara hang his scarlet ensign forth 
and woo in blood then from the east behold 
in a white ensign fill with star of gold 
burn the venetian love the morning sun 
court not the world more amorous he as mild 
as Myrrha boy do prove that love a child 
not tetchy if not wrong the other like mar 
hem in his Venus in his arm of steel 
And vow a conquest see where they appear 
madam your love which hand for a dukedom 
be I a orator I can praise Ferrara 
he like the marble statue of some God 
carry command in his proportion 
in he love seem a warrior for the fire 
of best affection burn in hot desire 

and yet methinks the smooth Venetian 
shall more contenta Venus 
in he love seem as he be calm and mild 
please and sportful thing rough and violent 
die like abortive fruit before perfection 
they be pursy and short breathe the ardor of true love 
burn in a calm breast in he affection 
be not like tempest rage yet of force 
like a even gale of wind to bear love ship 
unto the port of happiness his fire 
burn and consume not but maintain desire 

give over my claim that shall argue 
a too cold temperature in love beside 
it will disable the venetian power 
not to make good his challenge I dare not 

why she be i by promise 

I grant that Borgia she uncle and protector 
promise you that which he can perform 
but know Ferrara that my claim take root 
and grow upon the promise of the state 
I by the senate be assure her love 
and on that ground the justice of my cause 
plead thus in arm against the city wall 

herein you err for know the florentine 
die a prince powerful and absolute 
not countermand by a popular voice 
or by the ambitious faction of a senate 
leave the protector in his daughter nonage 
free like himself and absolute of power 
to promise and perform on his assurance 
live my love right then be you both 
direct opposer of what I claim by heaven 
and by that influence that make i great 
I will pursue my challenge through your blood 

give not such passage to your heat my lord 

then give my power a passage to my love 

that I demand of you 

and I command 
that without stay you raise your power 
and leave this city siege unto our arm 
or what we aim at they we will turn on you 

although your power we be equal with your pride 
I will dare stay Ferrara and proclaim 
thy title weak thy claim litigious 
my only just apparent righteous 
yet let not fury so impeach our wisdom 
to jar for her another do possess 
and make our folly laughter to our foe 
will then Ferrara make his passion subject 
to a indifferency that I shall propound 

if the indifferency you shall propound 
divide not i from julia 

she be the main claim of both our arm love 

and without her there be no indifferency 

you be frivolous 
why know Ferrara thy prerogative 
extend no further than thy sword can reach 
then when thy conquest have confirm thy will 
thou may capitulate with rude command 
until when proud prince stoop at imperious chance 
for do not other title than my sword 
make my claim righteous yet the doubtful lot 
cast on the end of war carry my fate 
even with thy pride the lady as i own 
to show a eminence that over look thy hope 
I challenge and aver the right of war 
due to my sword 

unsheathe it then

I very believe it for her very countenance and complexion show she be able to allay any man courage live with a breath 

Phego do you espy no motion behind the arras no sqall muzzle or page stand sentinel or because our head the lady julia be dead be all her servant that be her member in the same predicament

but these be but petty observation I have see since my come to Florence the son of a pedlar mount on a foot cloth a fellow create a lord for the smoothness of his chin and which be more I have see a cap most miraculous turn into a beaver hat without either trim or dress

fall fall you silver pearl and of the earth 
purchase a soft relent at my grief 
shower down like rainy drop and pierce the stone 
make they receive my sorrow or from my eye 
run like to crystal river through the world 
slide over the flowery meadow that the nymph 
dance in fairy ring upon the grass 
may leave their sport and weep to see you pass 
where by the doleful murmur as you go 
the hill may hear you mourn and sound my woe 
pardon if I be tedious virgin spirit 
or if my grief be too effeminate 
thy habit be a index to revenge 
which thy wrong seem to plead for of my love 
speak they or deal they through the yield air 
into my ear and they shall be to i 
like the stern drum or music of the war 
unto the coward or the faint soldier 

Venice I be murder

bellow for grief and roar upon the sand 
so from the earth it cry and like a child

as my soul love and they both shall leave 
a story to the world of my revenge 
nor in succeed time shall be forget 
Venice revenge those wrong the heaven will not 
I interrupt what that will say and seem 
to crown all vengeance in a passion 
speak but his name 

my uncle Borgia 

enough 
o that the genius that attend on man 
shall be a doubtful oracle to the soul 
and whisper to our intellect what fate 
hang like a fall tower upon his state 
yet be no more of force to length our joy 
then be Cassandra prophecy to Troy 
disloyal treacherous villain Borgia 
some Hydra poison or the blood of Nessus 
cleave to thy flesh 
o my blood swell beyond my power my voice 
loud than his that thunder through the cloud 
shall speak this monstrous murder to the world 
I will be thy orator wrong spirit and plead

Priapus thou woman god assist i with a jovial ability this night I may beget a Hercules fortune I must confess thou have turn up thy muffler and cast a gracious aspect on bordello for I be not only in the state of clean linen but also thou have make i gracious in the eye of signior Diaspermaton my apothecary who have furnish i with this receipt here be a compound of cantharides Diositerion marrow of a ox hair of a lion stone of a goat cocksparrow brain and such like this after a hour receipt have a fourfold operation and lest I shall be like a peacock all tail and no heart here be a distillation of ten pound a pint that comfort the inward fire the brain cheer up the spirit and make a man lay about he like a dutchman let i see it be more than time that I commit this divine pill to his hopeful work lest my staff be out of the rest when my adversary be in the career So Cupid fair mother be thy mid wife out and alas I be mare rid what summoner ghost or limb of Lucifer put poor bordello in mind of penance before he have trespass 

I be espy he fear do apprehend i for a ghost 
and I must feed it 

see it make towards i infortunate bordello that the devil shall be a enemy to lechery 

Come let we set to our business Phego 
lend we your wind to cool this posset 

it be not the first time I have be constrain to puff and blow in your ladyship service 

it have oft come in my mind to know the derivation and denomination of this word posset 

I take it that it come of the latin word posse to make a man able and that be the reason ever after eat they man desire to make experience of their force 

I rather conceive it come of the word pono of put together for that your posset be the usual mean of congregate put and combine your court creature together 

and that may well be for I remember that reverent pedagogue William lily bring in gigno pono cano one in the neck of another gigno to beget pono to put in and canon to sing 

that lily be a beastly knave to put pono behind gigno there be no music in it but all this time we miss not signior bordello it have not be his custom to be absent where his chap may have have employment 

you speak of the day of hunger when the slave be a strange in the land of Havilah but the word be retrograde the last age be a golden age with he 

see where the son of Saturn appear 

sfoot I think the dogfish have be bait Cerberus ere this time 

Ladies do you not see a spirit pass this way 

thou see we be feed the flesh man what do thou talk of the spirit 

without jest a mere ghost stand bolt upright at timocleas chamber so nigh court incubus on my life 

be you not much terrify signior with the apparition 

How terrify I no soon behold it but draw my better part together enter Timoclea help help all run out Timoclea follow the eunuch out 

fear and suspicion two nightwaking charm 
banish all sleep suggest in my thought 
falsehood and treason I be slow and dull 
descend like the earth yet I know not what 
prick like the thorn of Philomel at my breast 
and tell i there be danger in my rest 
sometime I think of julia and that thought 
present her love in a live shape 
when not remember death I open my arm 
to tie a gordian knot about her waste 
and bid her welcome but that empty clasp 
delude my false hope with nought but air 
make my blood angry and do turn my passion 
to seek a subject fit for my revenge 
and then I ever think of Borgia 
as if my love be wrong by Borgia a groan within 
what mean these sudden tumult in my ear 
save i eternal guard of innocence 
treason treason villain thou shall buy my blood 

o spare i 

distraction of my brain what shape be thou 

Julia exit 

julia hah stay it be go do I see 
or do my fear and fancy frame this form 
villain thou be some instrument of falsehood 
confess thy treason

pursue i through the court till for my rescue 
fear make i use this violence at your chamber 
o I be slay and die a causeless death 
I never live false to thou all thou have gain 
be that my soul die clear and leave thy stain he die 

to do thou good my soul shall say as much 
and witness it before the judge of soul 
when at the general bar we meet together 
but I must use thy shape this night I will walk 
hide in thy habit from discern eye 
I will pry about the court perhaps I may 
once more see Julia ghost and learn her wrong 
by they to aim aright in my revenge 
my hand first die the scene and it shall fill 
the stage with vengeance Nemesis shall wade 
up to the chin and bath herself in blood 
the dangle snake that hang about her neck 
shall suck like Lethe of the purple gore 
shed for my Julia death 
I will feast the ravenous people of the air 
and fill the hungry wolf with slaughter man 
the street of Florence like the street of Rome 
when death and Sylla range shall run with blood 
their swell channel with a scarlet tide 
shall wash the store and for my iulias death 
the angry god of wrath shall smile as please 
to see i so revenge Eunuchu thy death 
be but a prologue to induce a plot 
may thou be bless thou be not worth my hate 
I must reach high and on thy disguise 
lay but the groundwork for revenge to rise Exit 

be please you power of might and about i skip 
your antic measure like to coal black moor 
dance their high Lavolto to the sun 
circle i round and in the midst I will stand 
and crack my side with laughter at your sport 
o my hope fat i nor shall time grow old 
or weary with attend my success 
one night shall crown i happy Borgia wife 
appear unto the duke for Julia ghost 
to breed suspicion in they of her murder 
so that if Borgia chance survive this night 
as he must die if all my plot hit right 
the duke tomorrow when the senate sit 
may prove what I will affirm against his life 
nor to redeem his safety shall he bring 
the lady to disprove what we aver 
here will I cease and in some strange disguise 
keep till my grow faction be of force 
to second my ambition for the crown 
if I plot well fair Amada must die 
and by her mother hand she must not live 
to speak her father wrong Timoclea

not for the love I bear Timoclea 
but to suck from thy use the sweet of love 
I bear to julia it be love and state

and carry from myself with idle thought 
of what sad melancholy suggest in i 
what comfort bring thou have thy dead shape

their eye like fire star set on thy face 
their speech abrupt and short their hair upright 
stiff like the quill of porcupine be bless

and I will court thou even in Phoebus sight 
although it move a envy in the god 
be Jovial and like Salmecis thy love

and with my please motion make thou sport 
I will court thou naked as do the queen of thought 
her sullen boy and all to make thou sport

time have not set the character of age 
on my smooth brow my pulse beat as high 
as when my first youth lift up my blood 
I buy no beauty nor have nature be 
a niggard in my face I be yet young 
fresh and delight some as the chequer spring 
the lily and the rose grow in my cheek 
and make a bed for love to rest he on 

but I be restless

and on a altar offer to our love 
the thigh of sparrow and of turtle dove

and can stop the anchor of my thought 
reason be lose and like the vinegod priest 
run down Nisa or from Pindus top 
I be unstaid and doubtful in my course 
o the strong power of sense I must do that 
which all succeed time to come shall speak

O have our soul no deep sense than flesh

obsequious to take impression 
from every rude hand and be like this will 
that will we unto some deformity 
I shall not Amada complain of wrong 
but make religion of my force restraint 
I then shall sleep and pray and on my bead

drive through the air sing horror to the world 
and let they hurl i against the labour cloud 
sink to the brazengated deep abyss 
where fury sit curl their snake in knot 
and pull a viper from Allecto head 
and on these breast that in thy heat of life

and through the gentle air hurl their perfume 
I hear the sun steed trot towards the milky way 
and in a coach of flame draw up the day 
aurorat usher to the star of night 
tell the approach of the god of light 
they begin to twinkle and take in their fire 
at their eclipse we spirit leave the air

from who high concave all inferior fire 
derive successive motion 
stand you nightwandering planet in a maze

a ravenblack canopy of congeal cloud 
that you may seem a chaos to the world 
and bode eternal darkness thou be not make to kill 
nor be the diadem of her Pontic queen 
make as a fatal instrument of death 
and yet it be the engine stop her breath 
as thou must i soul of Borgia 
thus to thy ghost I sacrifice my life 
to buy thy requiem

nay nay repent not dear Timoclea

snare in the wary hunter tangle toil 
grind the thin air swell high till thou burst 
and let the breath that like a vapour press 
struggle within thy bosom hurl thou up 
soft the time spend fast and I have much to think of 
before the telltale god display his light 
to show the world the horror of this night 
first for thy death the lustful Turk must die 
my rival in the love of julia

shall the Cecropian thief stretch my tear flesh 
rack on his bed of steel if on Caucasus 
my grow liver be expose a prey 
to raven praetor I will still laugh 
to see thou like a fall pinetree reel 
in a rough tempest 

hold up you break organ of my soul 
carry i high and make i stand as firm 
as oak on Ossa that advance their top 
even till their root break Timoclea 

for love of i kill her own child 
thy daughter Amada 

amazement 

bless fate I thank you I shall die revenge 
fly jove love Nemesis and at justice foot 
shake thy triumphal ash I slay Timoclea 

by thou before thought dead 
I take she from the hearse of julia 
when in the habit of a murder ghost 
this night she appear to the duke to breed 
suspect in they of thou and arm their hate 
unto my plot faction 

damn illusion 

where be Ferrara 

heaven be his guard 

so they be he kill my slave 
and in his habit by this hand he die 

false perjure villain he run at he 

sink sink Cithaeron high Pallene tremble 
green Tempe wither and with i forgo 
your place and be this whole world of flesh 
with fatal earthquake totter 
false Turk thy fate be but as cruel as be Borgia hate moritur 

stoop down thou Lydian mount bend thy cold head 
and hide it in thy brackish father wave 
that as thou shrink thy starry load may nod 
at mulleass fall or ever shroud 
those joyful bonfire in a mourn cloud moritur 

just end of treason 

Madame our duty joy your life 
and wish your happiness 

as the just reward of danger 
my lord I claim her love 

not without justice brave venetian 
she be herself and free 

and thus I give myself 

heaven seal it for the the good of both our state 

Philenzo

ambassador from we shall plead our sorrow 
even to your senate mean time his obsequy 
shall want no honour signior bordello 
we give you liberty what remain undo 
shall by the senate be confirm lead on
