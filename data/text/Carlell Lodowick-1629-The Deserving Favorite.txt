Come prithee tell i brother why be sad

and how at last I gain my dear Clarinda 

I do and wish that I can tell you such a secret of my own for of all man live I think you most happy 

most miserable of man 

how can that be be not Clarinda you 
in which be I a man I shall believe 
more happiness consist then for to be a monarch

I hope she be not sick 

nothing can take she from i dear Mariana 
but I must give she 

why love you any one so well to give away your heart 
I know she be dear to you 

she be so much dear to i than my heart 
that I must kill my heart if I do give she 

be plain sweet brother 

the duke who be too near a kin in love 
and blood to our dread sovereign to be deny 
die for Clarinda 

why think you she will prove false 

Shee false o no 
it be I must play the traitor to myself 
virtue do undermine my happiness 
and blow it up I must release my interest 
in Clarinda that she may marry this lovesick duke 
and save his life 

why who compel it 

gratitude compel it 
for to the duke I owe my life and fortune 
my fortune when my wicked uncle will have 
wrest from i by false witness that state 
which I be now possess of which the duke find 
he employ his power and so I have my right 
my life I then receive when I be rescue 
by his valour from the dreadful bore 
which I too young thrust on by honour venture to assail 
yet all these obligation touch i not so near 
as do the danger of the count Utrante 
clarinda father who have be long a prisoner 
for the same cause for which my father flee 

he be now at liberty 

it be true he have his liberty and great honour 
be propose if he can win his daughter 
to marry with the duke than he have lose 
but on the other side if she deny 
and it do whole lie in i to make she grant 
her father head be in danger the king 
so passionate do love the duke 

How come you by this miserable knowledge 

sister you know I often visit 
the count Utrante in the prison beside 
the wish occasion which I ever take 
to wait upon his daughter thither 
this he so grateful accept 
that now that he have liberty 
he still send for i where I chance to be last night 
and as a friend hear when he do propound it to Clarinda 

then he do not way suspect there be love betwixt you 
but tell i brother how poor Clarinda 
do receive her father deadly proposition 

her father not believe that she will deny 
so great a blessing come with joy to tell she 
that which once tell force tear from her fair eye 
at which he be amaze desire to know 
the cause why she receive his and her happiness 
with somuch sorrow she answer he with break sigh 
offer to tear her hair which when I will not 
give she leave to do she curse her beauty 
as the cause of all this mischief at last 
consider who it be that speak 
a father that deserve a answer 
her judgement shut her passion in a less room 
for have calm the tempest of her grief 
she mild answer that she be happy 
in his liberty though now she see 
it be but give he to procure her bondage 
for such she do account all tie of marriage 
make by the parent without the child consent 
though never so rich or honourable 

and have say so do she not cast her watery eye 
upon you and in this sad yet please language 
tell you that she will not forsake you for the duke 

it be true she do so there be no tongue 
that can express the heart of those that love 
like their own eye but sister it will be late 
before you reach the forest the princess too 
may wonder at your stay 

brother it be true but I so seldom see you 
that I will not go unless you promise to come and see i

my lord Utrante can you not then 
persuade your daughter to receive a blessing 
which even the great lady in this kingdom 
will desire on their knee 
be this a man to be neglect though he be not 
a kinsman to your king beside my lord 
remember you may draw upon yourself 
our high displeasure by her refusal 

great sir let not your love and care of i 
bar fair Clarinda the freedom of her choice 
by threaten punishment unto her father 
if she choose not i for shall she offend 
which she may just be if I shall seem 
to force love from she it be not within your power 
though that you will give all that you possess 
to make i satisfaction for the wrong

for do that govern she she can not thus neglect 
her happiness or rather she may yet suspect your lordship 
do not mean what you profess and from that fear 
seem coy till she be more assure 

I can pluck my heart out of my breast 
to show she I wish I can yet live to do she service 
there she may see her worth true engrave 
in last character not to be raze out 
by the hand of time nor which be more her scorn 

cousin if you will be rule by i 
I will make she leap with joy into your arm 

sir so that it be by no way of violence 
I will obey you 

in act I will use no way of violence 
yet I must threaten it 

sir if you threaten she you ruin i 
her sunbright eye by faithful service 
may in time shine gentle on i and warm 
my freeze hope but on the contrary 
she know that I be the cause of these your threaten 
will from her just vex soul throw curse on i 
I will not see thou heaven of her fair face 
cloud with any raise by my power to be a monarch 

you know my love and you presume upon it 
take your own way of love deliver up yourself 
unto her mercy that I will make at you 
will you be rule go see your mistress 
tell she you love she more than ever man do woman 
to prove which true pray she that she will command you 
task more dangerous then do the envious Juno 
to great Hercules all which you will perform 
with much more ease since you by her command 
shall undertake they who virtue have the power 
to arm you against a world of danger do 
make she proud with praise and then see 
how she will torture you 

sir she may torture i and just too 
for my presumption since I have dare 
to tell so much perfection that I love 
not be first make worthy by my suffering 
for she

this day she either shall requite your suffering 
oh I will deny she for a child of i 

my lord most willing I will see fair Clarinda 
but not upon such condition nothing 
but gentle entreaty must be use for though the king 
be please to say that my humility 
will make her proud I will not have a subject 
say not you that be her father that she can 
do a act or think a thought that tend not 
to perfection 

Come my lord we will go hunt a stag today 
and leave my cousin to his amorous thought exeunt K Atten 

I thank your majesty for this day licence 
my lord Utrante shall I then see Clarinda 
and will you lend your best assistance 
to make i master of a happiness the world may envy 

my lord you make a idol of a peevish girl 
who have indeed no worth but what you please 
to give she in your opinion 

I must not hear you thus blaspheme 
you may as well say Pallas want wisdom 
Diana chastity or Venus beauty 
as say she want worth for every several excellence 
that shine in they and make they 
by man admiration goddess 
flow mix in she indeed she have 
too much of Diane ice about her heart 
and none of Venus heat but come my lord 
I lose myself in her vast praise and so 
defer the joy of see what I so commend exeunt

tell your lady I will speak with she

the count Utrante be happy in this honest servant 
let i before I do persuade Clarinda consider well 
sure that hour in which I see she lead to the temple 
and there make fast with hymeneal right unto another 
will be my utmost limit and death be terrible 
not where there be so glorious a reward propose 
as be her happiness she shall be happy 
and in her happiness consist i 
have I not often swear I love she better 
than myself and this be only leave to make it good 

good morrow noble brother for by that title 
I be proud to call you be deny a near 

it be a title that I be bless in 
nor can there be a near betwixt we two 
our soul may embrace but not our body 

let we go walk into the garden and there 
we may free speak and think upon some remedy 
against this disaster exeunt Lys and Clar 

what a dull slave be I have not I last night overhear their love parley I never once shall have suspect that they have be in love she always seem a enemy to love yet have be long most desperate in love with this young lord which quite will spoil my hope at court yet when I better think it will be for my advantage as I may handle it and further my revenge for I will insinuate myself into the duke good opinion by make a discovery of their love and then advise he that there be no way to gain clarinda heart till first Lysander be remove by some employment for out of sight with woman out of mind or if he impatient of delay I will advise he to use some bloody mean which if he want a instrument to do I will effect it myself pretend that it be out of love to he when it be indeed the satisfaction of my own revenge and when the duke be once a partner of my villainy I will be rich pay for what I do or else for all his greatness I will affright he 
for though great man for bloody deed 
give money to a knave 
yet if he be a witty one like i 
he will make that lord his slave 

Come let we sit down for I be tire 
with walk and than I will tell you 
how I be resolve to free we from this torment 

I fear there be no remedy but we must part 

yes if you will give consent to what 
I shall propound 

first let i hear it 

my father though he have his liberty 
be not yet restore to his land when next 
the duke do visit i which I believe will 
be today I will seem as if I do mistrust his love 
to be but feign he then will strive by some strong 
testimony to prove he true love 
then will I urge my father restoration 
to his land which he be once possess of 
will not be hard for i the world know 
how well he love i to get some coin and jewel 
in my power sufficient to maintain we 
in some other country where we like shepherd 
or some country folk may pass our time with joy 
and that we may without distrust effect this 
I to the duke will promise that when a month 
be expire if he will come and lead i to the church 
I will not refuse to go do you approve 
of this Lysander 

no dear Clarinda 
though most man hold deceit in love for lawful 
Lysander do not ere you for i shall spot 
your yet pure self with such a stain as to be 
a deceiver this sword shall pierce my heart 
the debt I owe you be too great already 
and till I clear some part I shall unto myself 
appear a most ungrateful man when first I see you 
the height of all my aim be only to have leave 
to love you so excellent I then esteem you 
but you in time out of your bounty 
not for my desert for no desert can reach 
your height of merit give love for love 
for which I owe my life save by that mercy 
from despair and lend i for to serve you 

you be too thankful and attribute that 
to my bounty which be the wage of your true 
and faithful service 

be this grant yet however I shall be able 
to free myself from that great burden of debt 
which your intend flight for my sake 
will lay upon i as yet I can see 
for do at all value your own happiness 
you can not thus fly the mean 
that can best make you so 

Lysander to what tend this great acknowledgement 
I understand you not what be your meaning 

my meaning dear Clarinda be to make you happy 
and I conjure you by your affection 
and all that be dear to you to lay by 
that little portion of wilfulness 
which be a woman you be force to have 
and hear i with your best attention 
and with the same affection as if I be 
your brother which if the heaven have please 
to make i I have be most happy 
with your best reason look upon your present fortune 
look first upon the man from whence you have your be 
and see in reason what pity it will challenge from you 
a noble ancient gentleman deprive of land 
and honour by injustice that as a stranger 
may exact your pity but as a child 
it be within your power it force your consent 
to give a remedy if pity of your father fortune 
can move you pity your own I beseech you 
consider not of i as a torment lover 
that have lose his mistress but as a fortunate brother 
fortunate in see of his sister who he dear love 
marry to one so worthy who merit 
compel fortune to wait upon he for such the duke be 
who you must not refuse for such a poor 
unworthy man as I be 

shall I grant your want of worth 
I then must give consent to the commit 
of a sacrilege against the god in suffer you 
to rob yourself you be the pure temple 
that yet they ever build for to be honour in 
and for the duke each worth which you express of he to i 
be but a double of your own 
the way to speak for he be to appear 
yourself less worthy in this your worth increase 

will you but look with a impartial eye 
on our deserve you soon will find i 
the less worthy for even in that wherein 
you think i not to be equal he go 
far beyond i I mean in true affection 
for be but a private man as I be 
who will not think he bless to love and be belove 
by you that be esteem the wonder of this age 
but for the duke within who power it lie 
to choose the most transplendent beauty of this kingdom 
set off with fortune best endowment for he I say 
to choose out you among a world of lady 
to make the sole commandress of himself 
deserve if you will give your reason leave to rule 
the near place in your affection 

do not thus vain strive to alter my opinion 
of your worth with word which be so firm ground 
by your real action it be a fault but I will strive 
to wash it from you with my tear 

these tear in she stagger my resolution 
for sure he must be worthy for who she weep 
Clarinda dry your eye 

how now jasper where be my father 

madam he do desire that you will make you ready 
to come to supper to the duke tonight 

he be resolve to have sup here 
how have he change his mind 

madam he desire you not to fail 
but come and bring my lord here with you 

well I will obey he exeunt 

Come prithee be careful we shall gain 
more upon my lord good opinion 
if we please he this day then hereafter 
in the whole service of our life 

why prithee 

here will this day be his fair mistress Clarinda 
and her father 

I think it be some extraordinary occasion 
he be himself so careful will there be none else 
will not the king be here the entertainment 
will be worthy of he 

it may be brave Lysander will be here none else 
for he be always with the count Utrante 

when come he home from travail 
I do not see he since he lie here in my lord house 
to be cure of the wound the boar give he 
he owe my lord for save of his life then 
I help to bring he out of the field 

my lord be happy in save of so brave a gentleman 

can I love Clarinda yet go about 
to hinder she of be mistress of all this riches 
each room we pass through be a paradise 
the music like the music of the sphere 
ravish the hearer with content and admiration 
but that which add unto all the rest 
be the duke true affection I be ashamed 
when I consider of my indiscretion 
that will have bring she to the counterpoint 
of this great happiness 

noble Lysander welcome excellent lady 
all the honour that my great and royal master 
have bestow upon i equal not this 
that you have do in grace at my request 
this now most glorious house since it contain within it 
the glory of the world 

my lord your praise fly too high a pitch to light on 

they must do so or they will fall short 
of your great worth 

a reasonable pitch will soon strike 
i with belief 

to give you a firm belief of the respect 
I bear you be that I only aim at 

my lord it lie in your choice whether I shall 
believe you or no for if you will speak 
only that which in reason be likely to be true 
I be no infidel I shall believe 

you be so far from be a infidel 
that you be a saint at who bless shrine 
I offer up my life and fortune 
with a true devotion than ever lover do 

I see I must allow you the lover phrase 
which be to call their mistress St and their affection 
devotion but to let your phrase pass 
and answer the meaning of your protestation 
how can I believe that you can love i 
better than any man do ever love his mistress 
there be such a inequality in our present fortune 
when equality do give birth to more affection 
and those more violent there be no respect 
to be a hindrance I mean both the equality 
of birth and fortune in both which we far differ 
you be the next a kin unto the king 
and I the daughter to a condemn man 
though now for your own end at liberty 

if it be lawful for your devote servant 
to contradict you in any thing it be 
in the defence of his affection 
you know that river be stop by any impediment 
as rock or bridge run the more fierce 
when they be from that which do encumber they 
so may I say for my affection 
if I shall acknowledge which yet I will not 
that the consideration of my greatness 
be for a while a impediment to the current 
of my love but alas those consideration 
can never find harbour in that heart 
where love and admiration have already 
take up their lodging nor do they in my opinion 
deserve to be happy who mix the consideration 
of the good of fortune with their affection 

my lord in this last I do unfeigned believe you 
I mean in your opinion which be that true love 
can be mix with respect and to show now 
how well I believe you I will make it my shield 
both to defend i against your worthy affection 
I confess if your thought and word agree 
and against my father unjust command 
for since you confess that to mix love with respect 
spoil the purity of it and that they 
who so mix it deserve not to be happy 
it must needs be great injustice in you 
and my father to desire i to love you 
unworthy since I can love you 
without mix the consideration 
of the benefit my father shall receive 
by my marriage with your grace beside 
the satisfaction of i own ambition 
in be a duchess may make any stream 
of affection which can proceed from i 
unfit to mix with so pure a stream 
as you profess you be 

madam I can deny what you affirm 
since you ground your argument upon my confess 
opinion but know dear lady that as you manifest 
in this your cruel answer your disdain of i 
which will incense my despair yet on the 
other side the excellence of your wit 
will increase my desire for even out of that 
which I bring as a argument to move you 
the more to love you conclude that you be 
to neglect and with a seem justice 
which show that your wit can bring nigh thing 
to pass that your will shall employ it in 

I shall account myself happy be I 
so furnish but my lord I must not look 
upon myself in the flatter glass 
of your praise for I hate flattery though a woman 
and as I be myself arm against flattery 
so will I have you be therefore I tell you 
that I can never be you to arm you against 
the flattery of hope yet I must tell you 
that your desert if it be possible 
for i to love may soon do it then any other 
but as I be a votaress to Diana in who temple 
I do short mean to dwell I be free 
from any fire that can be kindle 
by desert in man 

though your intention in this cruel answer 
may be charitable as intend 
to allay my heat by manifest your boldness 
yet it have wrought deadly effect for it 
force i tell you that I must disobey you 
for rather than I and the rest of the world 
will lose so great a blessing there shall not 
be a temple leave stand that be sacred 
to Diana within this kingdom when this be do 
to make your cruelty admire I will build 
a altar to selflove it be that power you obey 
and not Diana on which some friend shall lay 
my bleed heart which now in thought 
and then in act shall be a real sacrifice 
smile not nor think this jest 
for by that Diana who you seem to worship 
be yourself a great deity 
when you do cruel perform what 
you have rash say this heart 
which now seal what my tongue have speak 
shall make the covenant perfect 

I see this be no way my lord 
this rash oath you have make may cost you dear 

in that consider the greatness of my love 

the greatness of your folly rather 
that think by threaten punishment to yourself 
to make i pity you when since I do not love you 
I be not touch with any feel of your grief 

if not for i yet for your goddess sake 
give over your ill ground resolution 

my lord the king be new light at the garden gate 
and in all haste call for you 

madam the king to who my person be a subject 
command my presence and I must obey he 
but my heart which I have make you sovereign of 
shall stay to wait on you my return must needs 
be speedy since I leave my heart at the mercy 
of you my cruel enemy 

my lord I shall so martyr it before I come again 
that you will repent you 

you can give it deep wound 
then you have do already and in that 
confidence I will leave you 

madam will it please you walk into the gallery 
there be some picture will be worth your see exeunt 

will none go call the duke welcome dear cousin

not for that you be my kinsman I never yet deny 
what you will ask rely on your judgement 
and your virtue shall you have ask my sister 
for your wife I soon shall have give consent 
and tax your judgement less than I do now 
for dote on this lady call back for shame then 
that judgement which have wont to govern all 
your action and make i once more proud 
that I have such a kinsman who judgement 
can control his strong passion even love itself 
when it be prejudicial to his honour 

sir you have always be a father to i 
and study that which have be for my good 
better than I can think I know your majesty 
intent in this be to persuade i from that 
which you believe be prejudicial to i 
but since without her love gain the fair way 
of service not by threaten I can take joy 
in nothing this world can afford i 
pardon i sir if I desire you to spare 
your counsel since I be capable of none 
except you persuade i to love more 

well sir I will leave you to your amorous passion 
see i no more till I send for you exeunt king atten

for your young lady sake 

my lord the business I have to deliver 
concern your grace 

how i what be it speak 

my lord it be a secret and do concern Clarinda 
and therefore send your people off 
that with more freedom I may speak with you

what think your lordship be the cause 
that move Clarinda to neglect your love 

the knowledge of her own worth and my unworthiness 
which defect I hope in time my faithful service 
shall make good and she will love i 

never my lord 

why be her vow of chastity already past 

Shee vow chastity

how she deceive your grace tell you

for I vow the earth shall not long bear we both 
I will not tell you unless you will promise 
to follow my advice which if you will 
I will show you a clear way to your desire 

what do you riddle i be she contract 
and can I by your counsel attain my wish 
no the house of fate though they shall all 
take counsel can back restore the happiness 
thou have robe i of in say she be contract 

my lord do not thus waste yourself 
in fruitless passion but hear the remedy 
that I will propound 

first let i know which of the god it be 
that in a mortal shape have gain her love 
that thou suspect she be contract 
or else some king that in disguise have leave 
his kingdom to obtain her love 
who be worth many kingdom 
name not a mean rival if thou do 
expect I shall believe 

my lord it be a man to who 
your valorous hand give life 

curse be my hand then for that unkind office 
against my heart name he 

it be the young lord Lysander 

take that ignorant fool Lysander strike he 

how strike be this my hope reward 
by all that be good I will be revenge 

I be too rash 
she be a woman and may dissemble Lysander to 
be noble courteous valiant handsome 
but yet compare with i his fortune nothing 
Alas that can bar love out of a noble breast 
such as clarinda be what way my birth 
or greatness with the king in her consideration 
Lysander equal fortune and her own 
in that their father suffer for one cause 
his banish she a prisoner till I release he 
have I fear beget a mutual love betwixt they 
friend prithee pardon i I be too rash 
I will heal thy hurt with gold 

my lord I be a gentleman 
and be you not a kinsman to the king 
the blow you give i may have cost you dear 

I will heal thy reputation and thy head 
with store of crown here but prithee tell i 
what move thou to discover this to i 
or how come thou thyself to know of it 
I think her father do not 

I think he do not it be long since 
since I suspect it and to assure myself 
the other night I creep behind the arbour 
where they use to meet sometime and soon by their 
discourse I find what I suspect to be most true 
my love unto your grace make i so curious 
for I protest there be no man alive 
that be more ambitious to do your lordship service 
it grieve my soul to see a man that so deserve 
so much neglect and abuse some of this be true 

if thou will make thy fortune 
bring i where unseen I may overhear they 

so your grace will not discover yourself 
I will promise you once within three night 

by my honour I will not perform 
thy promise and I will make thou happy

at your return to they the least distemper

will you accept the picture but much happy 
if you will take the substance

when the duke return to use he with respect 

father I see you have no skill you do not know 
the craft we woman use to make man love the more 
the small favour I shall show he after this harsh usage 
will make he think himself in heaven 

before you part when he come back

but first promise to marry he

gentle lady I crave your pardon for my stay 
which be draw out beyond my expectation 

methinks my lord look sour upon i 

my lord indeed I wonder how you stay so long

for that you leave behind you when you go 

madam I do confess it be a miracle 
proceed from your beauty that I can live 
so long want a heart but trust i 
if my faithful service can procure i you 
but that you needs will send my own again 
the miracle will then be alter quite 
for now the miracle consist in that I live 
and yet you have my heart and than it will 
be a miracle indeed if I do live after 
your scorn shall give it back again 

my lord I see it be not bounty 
but hope of gain make you give i your heart 
for you expect that I shall give you mine 
by way of recompense which yet I can do 
but that I may be sure they be true miracle 
that you be please to say my beauty work 
for there be many false one here in love religion 
I will take a month for trial of the truth 
all which time my charity compel i to keep your heart 
for shall I send it back you say it will kill you 
or work another miracle which I desire not 
in that time I shall be acquaint with your heart 
if then it do appear the same it now do 
clad in the same pure zeal that now it wear 
I will make a change and give you mine for it 
for when a month be once past come you 
and lead i to the church I will not refuse to go 

slave that I be to trust that villain jacomo 
that tell i she love Lysander dear lady 
you have in this comfortable answer 
revive a die man this mercy at the block 
show you to be divine and so a object 
fit for my affection which have be still 
above my reason but will you in the mean time 
command i something where my faithful service 
may appear more than in word I then shall be 
most happy 

this offer I expect 
my lord you know the injury my father 
have receive if you will see he right 
his land and honour back to he restore 
which be but justice for a bribe for even just cause 
now have need of bribery I will give you thanks 
and trust i that be more than great man 
shall expect for do justice 

rather if it please you 
let it be something wherein I shall have no other tie 
upon i but only your command my honour 
tie i to see this perform 

this once perform 
since you so much desire it I will study 
some command that may add honour to you 
in the fair performance 

Come my lord we will draw near 
I see their parley be at a end 

Come sit fair lady 
my lord what say my daughter 
will she yet yield to his own happiness 

I hope she will at last make i a fit mark 
for envy in that I be belove of she 
then for my present greatness 

my lord there be no cause of envy for either 
the greatness of your honor be but the just 
reward of your unequalled merit and for Clarinda 
though her worth be great as you can wish it 
yet you do well deserve she both for your worthy love 
and for the many favor you have do she father 

my lord believe i he have speak my thought 

now when the king send for i I have prevent 
your daughter in a command that she lay upon i 
concern your restore to your land 
but that the king be angry at something that I say 

I think it have be impossible 
he can have be offend with your grace 

it be true at other time he can not 
but the lord tell i that his sister 
fair Cleonarda have receive a hurt 
by rescue of the hound from the stag fury 
when he stand at bay and that make he it may be 
so apt for to be angry 

why do they suffer she so to endanger herself 

my lord she apprehend not danger 
which you will confess yourself when you have hear 
i tell what I have see her do 

this act to i my lord be a sufficient testimony 
that she do not fear for by the law of hunt 
it be not to any man think a disparagement 
to give way to a stag his head be hard 

she be a lady of that noble spirit 
that she want nothing but the person of a man 
to be one her heart be equal 
to the most valiant with these eye I see she 
the king she brother be in the forest 
break from the company and pursue a wolf 
which the hound follow of a stag 
do bring out of a thicket and be well horse 
she ply he with so many wound shaft 
that he at length be force to stay his course 
and sing there be no way to escape by flight 
he turn for to revenge the wound he have 
receive in which he show himself a beast indeed 
and lead by brutish fury for have he be 
endue with reason he will have take the wound 
she give for favor and kiss the instrument 
that honour he with death from her fair hand 

my lord it be strange a woman shall do this 

I be the near but ere I can come in 
she have cut off his head the service 
that I can do she be to carry to the king 
her brother that trophy of her victory 
while she follow the hound and so flee 
from the hear of her own just praise 
which all with admiration do bestow upon she 

but that your grace do tell it 
I shall not think a woman can do this 

my lord do I love you so well as to be jealous 
these praise of the princess be apt food 
for it to feed on 

madam I honour she as the belove sister 
of my sovereign but adore you as my goddess 
at who bless shrine I offer up my life and fortune 

my lord I shall account it as the most acceptable 
service that you can do to bring i to kiss the hand 
of this much to be admire lady 

madam once every week she come to see the king 
and the king every time he hunt fail not 
to see she when next she come to the court 
I will wait upon you to she 

what be the reason 
she live not with her brother at the court 
since he so dear love she as they say 

it be certain no brother love a sister better 
for there be no brother have a sister so worthy 
you have never a brother 

my lord it be late 
and though heretofore the company of a father 
be a sufficient buckler to bear off slander dart 
yet now world be change grow so vicious 
that father be become the likely instrument 
of sin and woman be not to satisfy themselves 
alone with be good but they must give the world 
a firm belief of all their action 
that they be so there may be some sing i here 
thus late that will not stick to say my honour 
be the bribe pay for my father restoration 

though there be find one envious woman foolish 
and wicked to report it for both these she must be 
there can not sure be find another fiend 
of the same stamp that will believe it 
I dare not though I wish it bid you stay long 
I will wait upon you to your coach 

my lord it shall not need 

my lord I hope it will not be long 
before this ceremony of part will be quite lose 
and that you will not be so far asunder 

in hope of that bless hour I live 

do not too strong apprehend your happiness 
a month be a long time all thing be uncertain 
especial the promise of woman exeunt 

fortune I see thou be a friend to work spirit 
thou will not else have give i this occasion 
so soon to compass my end by I overhear Clarinda 
when she entreat Lysander to meet she in the 
accustom place and thither will I bring the duke 
he from clarinda promise of marriage 
be now grow something doubtful whether that 
which I do tell he be true or no but now his own ear 
shall be his witness for which service he can choose 
but both love a reward i 
but I lose precious time which wise man ever 
consider of but fool seldom or never Exit 

have you not send i word I have not come tonight 
it be so dark 

it be dark indeed the fit for one overcharge 
with grief in heart as I be 

why dear Clarinda be you not resolve 
to marry with the duke 

I see Lysander you do not love i now 
nor wish my happiness you will not else 
persuade i from love you wherein it only 
can consist 

will you still for the airy name of constant 
rob yourself of a substantial happiness 
beside think what duty bid you do it 
in respect of your father if he shall marry 
he must needs fall into the king displeasure 
he be his kinsman so what happiness 
can you enjoy will you be rule by i 
and I will show you a direct way to happiness 
do you love i as you profess 

you know I love you more 
than I have word to utter 

yet you will never give consent to marry i 
though it be still my suit allege 
that our fortune be too mean and have we 
without marriage enjoy the sweet of love 
it have be dangerous unto your honour 
shall you have prove with child but will be now 
secure in that respect if you marry with the duke 
and for our difficulty in meeting 
it will add to our delight now every time 
that we shall meet in secret will far pass 
a weddingnight in joy steal pleasure give 
a appetite secure delight but cloy 

o my vex soul 
must I then hear a villain speak thus to she 
I love and not revenge it present 

my lord remember your oath 

Lysander why do you stare so and look pale 
your hair stand up a end as if your sense 
begin to fail you sure you be fall mad 
nay I do hope you be so for if you be not 
I be more miserable than if you be 
for can Lysander be himself and speak thus 
to his Clarinda no he can either Lysander 
be change from what he be or else he never 
be what I esteem he either of which 
make i most miserable 

you will seem to think i mad when indeed 
yourself be so you will not else thus weep 
when I advise you to that which will be most to our content 

pardon i Lysander that I have seem 
for to believe for sure I do no more 
that which you have speak proceed from your heart 

why do you think that I dissemble in what I say 

yes Lysander I know you do dissemble 
for if you do not you be a loathe villain 

I do confess if I be that Lysander 
which I have seem to be it be impossible 
for i to think what I have speak but know 
Clarinda though hitherto I have seem 
to carry in my breast a flame so pure 
that never yet a spark of lust appear 
it have be a dissemble show of modesty 
only to cozen you and if Clarinda 
the requital of my affection be that which 
hinder you from these great honour be not deceive 
for you shall have more power than to requite it 
when you be great we be now equal 
but when you be a duchess then to enjoy you 
will be a double pleasure than you shall have 
occasion to express your love in my advancement 

I will kill he instant 

your oath my lord 

the merit of the act be so just 
will expiate the sin of perjury 

my lord 

what shall I hear she who I have adore 
almost with as much zeal as I have offer up 
my prayer to the god tempt to act of lust 
and not revenge it 

my lord hear i but speak and then do what you will if you shall thus in the night and in the house of the count Utrante kill lord Lysander your honour clarinda and her father will be taint and so breed strange combustion but if you be resolve that he must die which in my judgement be most necessary if you still love Clarinda I will undertake for to dispatch he by some mean or other but shall you now here in clarinda presence kill he she love her mind be so noble she will never endure you 

this be a villain a incarnate devil 
yet will I follow some part of his counsel 
lead i the way back unseen I will stay no long 
for if I hear he speak again in that base key 
I shall do that which I hereafter may repent 
no I will take the noble way to my revengement Exit 

Clarinda you have long be silent 
what be it you consider of if it be my word 
you must needs find they full of reason 

I will seem as base as he will have i 
and so find out whether he speak this from 
his heart or no 

I must confess that this which you have speak 
stand with good reason and reason be the rule 
by which we ought to square our action 
dare I believe that you will counsel i 
to any thing but that which will be most 
for my content and for the duke will it not be 
far less to his content not to enjoy at all 
i who he love then if he shall possess i 
and yet you have a share with he in my embrace 
for what be that husband worse who wife abuse he 
if she have but the wit to keep it from his knowledge 

it be true the duke be so noble and do withal 
so true love you that it will quite banish 
all base distrust so that we may with all security 
enjoy our love 

leave leave 

or if he shall find out our craft 
how soon may we dispatch he by poison 
there have be such thing do 

you do overact your part 
I see the end you aim at your virtue show itself 
quite through that mask of vice which love to i 
and to my father make you put on you think 
if you can have give i a belief 
of your unworthiness that then I will have give 
consent to have marry with the duke 
leave your dissemble then since you be discover 
lest you offend the god I only seem 
to give applause to what you say to find 
your craft 

I see my heart lie open to you 
you have speak my very thought indeed 
this be my end 

Lysander I perceive that your affection 
be altogether govern by your reason 
for which if it be possible I love you more 
because it well become a man to do so 
but I shall hate myself if I shall love 
accord to your rule which I will manifest 
for here I take the heaven to witness 
that if within three day you do not marry i 
I will kill myself speak quick for if you do not 
love i it be a great mercy to tell i so 
that I may die then to persuade i 
to love another that be impossible 
but death be easy 

Clarinda you have overcome by this rash oath 
my resolution for I perceive the fate 
have foreordain we shall enjoy each other 
after such real testimony to make our love the firm 
I do with joy embrace what you compel 
i to by your rash oath and if your father 
wilful will stay and not fly with we 
rather than I will ever draw tear 
from those bright eye 
I so dear love we will leave he to the danger exeunt 

shall I still love one that neglect my faithful service 
alack I can help it now I yield up 
my heart at the first summons her fair eye make 
methinks it be a kind of treason once 
to doubt that she be not the sovereign of all heart 
thus she that come to court to beg her father liberty 
have not that grant only but that I who beg 
it for she become myself her prisoner 
and never man be proud of his bondage 
then I be what though she love a villain 
who intemperate lust and base dissemble 
kather deserve her hate yet she be fair 
and virtuous still it be my part to let she 
see her error though with the danger of my life 
if I survive the combat and that she know 
for what respect I fight she can choose 
but love i and if the heaven have so ordain 
that I must fall under Lysander sword 
yet I have write that which shall give a better 
testimony that I do love she more than he 
who wait there 

my lord 

I mean to ride abroad this morning 
and if I come not back at night carry this letter 
to the king Bernardo carry this present 
unto the young lord Lysander exeunt 

my plot be dash the duke do turn his eye upon i as though he will look i dead I shall gain hate on all side if I be not wary and cunning dissemble revenge and profit be the end I aim at since I have miss the one I will make the other sure Lysander I do hate thou for come into the world to rob i of my land yet I do think thou be not only false my brother do trick which when I will have prove in open court the duke power bolster up against i but I do hope I shall be now revenge upon they both I will poison the duke myself and to the king accuse Lysander as if he have do it fear that the duke shall rob he of his mistress I have a servant shall swear what I will have he I keep he for the purpose since the duke will not give i leave to use my drug for he he shall himself taste of they lest for that kindness I offer he I shall myself be punish he that to honour look be not for my black end 
revenge and profit I will pursue through blood of foe and friend 

where be the duke sir 

he be this morning ride forth 
whither I do not know 

your letter sir do not require a answer 
it will not be long before I see his grace myself 

good morrow to your lordship 

good morrow sir I will read they once more over 
Few word but I believe a prologue too much mischief 
I fear that my affection and clarinda 
be to the duke discover and now disdain 
and anger to be outrival boil within his breast 
if it be so he take the noble way 
to use no other force but his own arm 
but how shall I employ my sword to take 
his life that give i mine my conscience tell i 
though it be not apparent to the world 
that I be even with he for that since I to he 
will have give up my interest in Clarinda 
will she have give consent it may be 
I be deceive in this my apprehension 
and that it be in love he send for i 
if it be so I shall be glad if not however 
I will meet he accord to his desire 
but first I will write a letter to Clarinda 
it may be I shall never see she more 
if I come not home tonight carry a letter 
you shall find within upon the table to Clarinda 
honour thou tie we man to strange condition 
for rather then we will lose the small part of thou 
we on a even lie venture soul and body 
for so they do that enter single combat exeunt 

it be hot Mariana we will rest ourselves a while 
and when the day grow cool have another course 

I wonder how the deer escape the followdog 
once pinch he 

it be the bush save he 

why will you course among the bush 
Gerard the keeper will have bring you 
to a fair course but you will never let 
he go along 

I hate to have a tutor in my sport 
I will find and kill my game myself 
what satisfaction be it to i if by another skill 
I purchase any thing 

yet you must have 
your husband choose to your hand the king your brother 
will take that pain for you 

he shall have leave to name i one 
but if I do not think he worthy of i 
I will break that kingly custom of marry 
for the good of the state since it make prince 
more miserable than beggar for beggar marry 
only those they love 

madam it be true we not alone in prince 
see the bitter effect of such force marriage 
but even in private family murder and 
adultery do often wait upon those couple 
who body be compel by parent or friend 
to join for worldly respect without the soul consent 

it be true Mariana how many careful parent 
that love their child dear think 
to make they happy by marry of they rich 
make they miserable both here and in the other world 

madam it be very hot will you go bathe yourself 
in the river 

with all my heart Mariana 
it will refresh we well against the evening 
I be resolve to kill a deer tonight 
without the keeper help exeunt 

I hope your grace have not long stay for i 

no Lysander you be come before 
my expectation though not before my wish 
you can guess the cause that I send for you 

my lord I can 
unless fortune be so favourable to give i 
a fair and just occasion by be your second 
to hazard that life for you which by your valour 
be preserve but why to hope so great a blessing 
I can see since who within this kingdom 
dare injure you yet you command 
that I shall come arm 

for be my Second banish that thought 
and yet I mean to fight today and for a injury 
that be do to i and you Lysander shall fight to 
not as a second but a principal 

with who 

with i Lysander 

with you my lord upon what quarrel 

I will maintain that I do love Clarinda 
better than you and better do deserve 
to be belove by she 

my lord I do confess it 
and so this can be a cause of quarrel 
she be your mistress and deserve to be so 
there be no other worthy of your service 
but for my part I have no interest in she 
more than a friend why shall your grace think 
I love she then so well to make my love 
to she the quarrel 

Lysander I do not think 
thou have be so base to have deny thy mistress 
but I will further maintain thou be thyself 
a villain a base dissemble lustful one 

have these word 
which wound you deep far than they do i 
since they be scandalous come from another 
my sword shall first have answer not my tongue 
but since you be one to who I owe my life 
I will keep another method first I will let you see 
the wrong you do i which if you shall not 
straight acknowledge our sword shall then decide 
whether this title be my due or no 
and lest you may condemn i for a enemy 
as think i your debtor I will let you see 
that you my lord be as much bind to i 
as I to you though you do save my life 

Lysander do not think 
you owe i any thing for save of your life 
the thanks if any be due to fortune 
who bring i thither for what I do 
a peasant may have do you be yourself 
almost a conqueror before I come 
though sure enough for want of blood to perish 
have I not bring you home which yet indeed 
be but my duty to help a wound man 
but how Lysander I shall stand engage to you 
for great obligation though this I grant 
be small I can see 

though you shall amplify as you diminish 
what you do form yet it will never equal 
the pull of my heart out of my breast 
for to give you content 

I can understand your riddle 
yet fear it tend to base submission 

duke be not deceive for after the discovery 
of that secret which I will tell you 
I will give you a assurance with my sword 
I do not fear 

what secret be this 

I do but now deny that I do love Clarinda 
but now I call the heaven to witness 
who must assist i in so just a quarrel 
that I do love her equal with my life 
and now I will maintain that I deserve 
to be better belove by she than you 

Come then may the true lover 
prove the victor 

first let i show you 
how I acquit the obligation I ought you 
Clarinda love i more than I can her yet though 
she thus love i I out of my gratefulness to you 
use the best part of my eloquence 
to persuade she to marry you and be not this 
a secret and a discharge of the debt I owe you 

these ear indeed can witness thou do persuade she 
to marry i but it be to satisfy 
thy own base end thy lust and thy ambition 
not out of thy gratitude to i as thou pretend 

my lust the vestal virgin that keep in the holy fire 
have not more cold desire than I have 

I in her father garden late last night 
overhear thou tempt that bright angel 
which my soul adore to act of lust 
and with such move reason that flesh and blood 
can never have resist consider 
that she love thou but that there be a power 
that govern above reason guard she 
from thy strong temptation 

my lord that curiosity have undo you 
for I do call the heaven to witness 
that what I then speak when I seem vicious 
be all dissemble intend you the fruit 
of that dissimulation for when I once 
have make myself a peer unworthy 
I think that she will then have turn 
the stream of her affection upon you 

can this be true 
sure fear make he invent this no sure 
he can be a coward Lysander 
thou have tell i that if it be true 
do render thou a perfect man but not 
a perfect lover and trust i if there be 
a possibility that I can live without Clarinda 
I shall be friend with thou but since she 
be the mark at which we both aim the one must 
by the blood of the other purchase that happiness 
and therefore guard yourself they fight 

my lord the injustice of your cause 
not fortune have disarm you and therefore yield 

if fear of death can make i 
forget Clarinda wear the victor prize 
than I perchance may yield but since it can 
make use of your advantage 

I scorn to gain a victory so poor 
but to this man that save my life 

you be a noble enemy and have so win 
upon i by my courtesy that can you 
quit your interest in Clarinda I shall with joy 
share fortune with you 

we lose time for since we can both 
enjoy Clarinda both must not live Lys fall 

fortune I thank thou 
now I be even with you rise 

I owe you for my life we be but quit before 
I will our quarrel be of another nature 

I will it be but as it be 
one of we must lie cold upon this grass 
before we part fight duke fall 

ah poor Clarinda this be too sad a witness 
of thy perfection will thou be here yet 
that I may take my last farewell 

o dear madame what a sad object be this 

be not afraid 
see if the breath have quite forsake that body 

o my best love Clarinda 
receive from my die lip a die kiss 

how be this 

madam the breath have quite forsake this body as I think oh my dear brother 

be it Lysander then who I have long so much to see 
I see he not since he come home from travail 
and much it grieve i that I see he thus 
this be the second time that I have see he 
besmear in blood 

dear brother speak who have hurt you 

dear sister 
what bless angel have bring you hither 

this it no fit time for question Mariana 
let we help he to the lodge before his loss of blood 
overcome his spirit 

fair and courteous lady pardon i 
my sight do fail through my excessive bleed 
which make i to mistake 

brother it be the princess 

o madam lead i no further then 
for you will curse your charity if you preserve i 

why sir 

because I have by this unlucky hand 
rob you of such a kinsman as our sovereign 
and yourself be just proud of 

who be that 

the duke who lie there as you see 

it can be 

madam it be too true 

alas my cousin 
sir you have a unlucky hand indeed 
for you have this day murder two 
justice will at your hand require his blood 

o madam say not so have you but even now 
so great a care to save his life and be you now 
so cruel to say that he must perish by the hand 
of justice though he shall escape these wound 
will not the duke have kill he if he can 
I will pawn my life upon it my brother kill he fair 

what shall I do if I help to preserve he 
that kill my kinsman it be unnatural in i 
and I beside may lose my brother good opinion 
and shall I be the cause that Mariana brother perish 
I shall lose she for ever either she will die for grief 
or else she will hate i I will do as I do first intend 
my conscience tell i it be the noble course 
beside there be something I know not what it be 
bid i preserve Lysander the great desire I have 
to see he breed from the general commendation which 
the world bestow upon he import something 

dear brother what be your quarrel 

Come sir be of good comfort neither your wound 
nor the cold hand of justice if it be 
within my power to help it shall rob 
your love sister of you she be by i 
so well belove 

I want word to express how much I love 
and honour you 

madam I will not have you go about 
to preserve i with your own danger 
I mean the king displeasure beside I fear 
your labour will be fruitless for if the lodge 
be not hard by sure I shall bleed to death 
before we can come thither 

it be but hard by 

then I may live to do you service 
rather let i perish before I trouble you 

you be her brother and can trouble i 
we will lay the body behind yond bush until we 
send for it exeunt 

can you not find the duke body 
say you Gerard 

nowhere madam can I find it 
and yet I have seek it round about the place 
where you appoint i I find the bloody plot 
where it have be his horse I find to 
tie fast to a tree 

it be strange what can become of it Gerard 
upon your life keep secret what you know 
and see that none come near the lodge 
I will send you all provision necessary 
pretend that Mariana be sick 

madam I fear she will be so indeed 
she do so apprehend her brother danger 

she have no cause no wound of he be mortal 
or if they be I have apply such sovereign remedy 
that they shall cure they but who shall be my surgeon 
love I must fly to thou I fear for remedy 
I pray thou go back and see that all thing be well 
and in the morning bring i word how she have 
sleep tonight 

madam there shall be nothing want 
that lie within my power Exit 

how careful be I 
of his wound methinks I will not 
have he die for all the world fie Cleonarda 
take at the first sight with outward beauty 
nor be assure first of the inward worth 
I wrong myself and he it be 
the inward bravery of his mind which all 
the kingdom do admire that turn my heart 
which until now have be like adamant 
to king to melt ice to he and not his 
outward beauty that never can have find 
a passage to my heart but that the way 
be chalk out to it by his fame but stay 
whither do my vain imagination carry i 
though Lysander can in worth equal the god 
yet it be not fit for i to love he as a husband 
he be my brother subject shall he be my master 
no to my old sport again tomorrow

I can now blame the duke for value

of some neighbour king that I without 
disparagement may love she but I forget 
myself these be poor humble thought 
and far beneath the majesty of a king 
lady I come to chide I fear you be the cause 
that I have lose a kinsman a worthy one 
in all the world opinion except you 

sir pardon i you be yourself the cause 
by your excessive love to he for that make i 
dissemble my affection to Lysander 
fear to daw your frown upon my father 
shall I have show neglect unto the duke 

whoever be the cause you shall not feel 
the punishment the duke do true love you 
lady which you shall see here in this letter 
apparent may you see your error 
and grieve to death for your past folly 
in refuse the quintessence of mankind

he show there in his letter that you be his wife 
that by that mean I may be draw the soon 
to perform his will which be that you shall

if he be dead

when you please lady Exit Cla 
my lord how chance it that you never tell i 
that your daughter love Lysander 

sir let i perish it I know it 
I be amaze to hear it now exeunt 

but sister can you think it possible 
the princess shall thus love i 

brother I know you see it yourself 
though you will not take notice of it 

believe i Mariana it do grieve i much 
so great a princess shall be so unhappy 
to love a man who heart be not his own 
for he that have a heart at his dispose 
can not deny to give it she 

when she shall know you have another Mistria 
she will call back her judgement and quick 
free herself but brother I do fear 
you love she too you look and speak to she 
with more affection than well become your faith 
be promise to Clarinda 

what will you have i to do 
shall I not back return those courteous look 
that she the saver of my life bestow upon i 
one knock without 

I will see who it be Exit 

How have your brother sleep tonight 

exceed well madam 
brother here be the princess 

Lysander how do your wound 
be your pain lessen 

madam I have no pain 
but that I fear I never shall be able to requite 
this undeserved favour 

let not that trouble you it be to i 
you owe the debt and I will find some way 
to pay myself that shall not make you poor 

what shall I say each virtuous deed 
reward itself and that be the coin with which 
you must be pay or else you will be a loser 

tell i Lysander and tell i true 
have you a master 

I dare not lie madam 
I have one that love i equal 

Lysander she have reason be I your mistress 
I think I shall love you better than myself 
but tell i Lysander what be the quarrel 
betwixt the duke and you 

madam I can tell you without discover 
that which I will glad keep conceal 
yet why I shall deny you the knowledge of any 
secret my heart hold I can see except I shall 
be most ungrateful you be the only cause 
that I have now a heart to keep a secret in 

what be it speak I long yet fear to know it 

the duke and I be rival 
Clarinda be the mark at which both aim 

which of you love she best 

madam she love i best 
we be bring up together 
which be her great misfortune 
for have she know the duke before i 
her judgement will have teach she 
to love the worthy 
and one indeed that love she better 
at least with great passion 

but do not half so well deserve to belove 
by she as you since he do go about 
to force love or at the least to take from she 
the love that which she most delight in her servant 

have once remove i he hope she 
will accept of he who will have make 
a worthy servant far since he have power 
to raise she to that glorious height of fortune 
which well will have become her merit 
but on the other side he know the mean 
of my fortune must needs obscure and darken 
her perfection so that he out of love 
to she rather then to himself desire 
to make her he 

he can not choose but know that if he kill 
the man belove by she she needs must hate he 
if she be worthy constant if not 
than he with danger of his life have purchase 
her too dear for I shall still believe 
if once she change she always will become 
the victor prize 

madam there be some unlucky mistake 
betwixt we or else we have not fight 

will it have please heaven you have not fight 
or that the duke have escape with life but since 
your quarrel be not to be reconcile though I 
do blush to say so I be glad it be he that perish 
for I have ever wish you well 
I will not have you think I be now in love 
with you yet by my life I can say but I may be 
hereafter though I know you have a mistress 
who perfection darken i give i those 
thing to dress his wound with 
the wound sure be give to i to make i happy 
in be touch by your soft hand my wound 
can never heal my prayer be against it 
because be well I can have this blessing 

what a strange alteration do I feel now 
when I touch you a certain coldness seize 
on my heart and all my blood fly to my face 
sure I do love you I never yet know what it be 
for to dissemble if I love I say so 
and if I hate I keep it not conceal 
I will not give a thought that be base 
a harbour in any breast what need I then 
conceal my heart the praise Lysander 
which be bestow upon thou have breed in i 
a great desire to be my own assurance 
whether thou be the master of so many 
excellency as fame bestow upon thou 
and now that I do find they rather do 
come short than any whit outgo thy merit 
wonder not that I though a princess be in love 
with thou for I have still profess to love the 
rich mind which be in thou complete 
with the addition of a comely personage 

I hope your grace do not mock i 

no by my life I take delight 
in look upon you 

I can think you be in earnest yet I will 
answer you as if you be shall you love i 
think you or will you wish that I shall break 
my forepast vow unto Clarinda 

no it must be for your worth if I do love you 
and when your prove unconstant you be 
no long worthy 

if I be constant 
what fruit can you receive from your affection 
a barren love will ill become 
so great a princess 

be you still constant love your Clarinda still 
for when you cease to be so I shall hate you 
only respect i as a sister for when my reason 
shall have leave to combat against my passion 
it will convert it to a sisterly affection 

madam I know 
in that you say you love i you do it only 
for to make a trial how strong I be arm 
by my clarinda merit against inconstancy 
and I confess if it be possible 
to undermine my faith and blow my former 
promise into the air your please speech 
and those yet majestic glance 
of your eye be the only instrument that yet 
I ever see to do it 

but speak you as you think Lysander 

else may I perish but mistake i not 
for though I can believe your beauty 
and merit to be above clarinda 
which be unpossible either that it shall be 
or that I shall believe it yet where my word 
be once past though all the torture man wit 
can invent shall at one instant environ i 
to torture the mind and body yet 
I will not break my faith 

may I be miserable if ere I persuade you to it 
yet I can wish that you do love i 
and with a little passion but do not make show 
of more than you do true feel think 
to please i for if I find it I shall be angry 
I will not hide a thought from you 

but madam be it possible that 
you shall love he thus 

I scorn for to dissemble for who stand 
I in fear of be the king my brother here 
sure I shall not deny that I love Lysander 

madam I rather wish 
my brother never have be bear 
then that the king shall know you love he 
nay I hope you know it not yourself 
shall I believe that your great heart that ever 
yet contemn love can on a sudden in four 
or five day knowledge be strike by my unworthy 
brother slender merit and one that must 
be perjure too if he shall love you 

Mariana take heed how you do pursue 
this subject for if you do I shall begin 
to hate you be you not ashamed to contradict 
yourself how oft have your own tongue 
give he the high attribute of worth 
nay you have be so lavish of his praise 
that I have check you for it though I believe 
they to be true because it come 
something too near the praise of ourselves 
to praise a brother I be myself a witness 
of his valour and his wit and those be sure 
the main supporter to all other virtue 
blush not Lysander to hear thy own just praise 
except it be that I do sully they in the delivery 
thou give too sad a witness of thy valour 
in overcome he which through this 
kingdom be esteem the brave man 

madam a brave man by far then he 
under who sword he fall fortune that do envy 
his worth because his mind be fortify 
above her reach apply herself that day 
unto the ruin of his body and then though 
never before nor since fight on my side 

when next I come 
I will entreat you tell i every particular 
accident through the whole combat 

most willing for I by that relation 
shall make apparent the difference betwixt 
his worth and i exeunt 

so many day overpast and yet no news 
of my dear cousin whether he be alive or dead 

sir there be a hermit 
which have bring sad news 

what of his death or that he be deadly hurt 

sir to your majesty he only will relate 
that which he have to say and yet by the sadness 
of his countenance know his news be ill 

call he in 
while with patience I forearm myself 
speak father be the duke dead what sad news 
be this you bring give i my torment in a word 

your fear be true indeed the duke 
be dead 

how do you know 

your majesty shall hear 
as I be gather root within the forest 
the best part of my food cast my eye aside 
I see a man lie welter in his gore 
straight I be strike with a sudden fear 
but charity prevail above fear 
I step to see if yet the soul have leave 
that comely mansion for so indeed it be 
find some spark of life remain I take 
a cordial water which I ever carry with i 
and by the help of that I bring he to his sense 
so that he be able to deliver these few word 
death I embrace thou willing thou be 
a far less torment then for to live 
and know Clarinda love another better 
may she enjoy Lysander who now I do 
believe be worthy of she for I that 
most unjust go about to cross it 
must pay my life down for my error 
Lysander I forgive thou my death and so 
I hope the king and with that word the king 
he sink between my arm and never 
speak word 

o what a man be this what marble heart 
that will not melt itself in tear to hear 
this sad relation but what become of the body 

there sir begin occasion of new grief 
while I do vain strive to call back life 
three barbarous thief seek some booty 
come by chance that way and see his garment 
rich they go about to strip he but hear 
of some noise within the wood one of they 
do advise to carry he to their boat which lie 
hard by within a creek I go about 
to hinder they and for my pain they do compel 
i to carry the body upon my shoulder 
threaten to kill i if I do refuse 
but not content with this they make i row 
they down the stream three day together 
until they come unto their fellow pirate 

what do they with the body 

throw it overboard when they have 
rifle it first 

How chance you come no soon to tell 
this news though yet too soon they be so ill 

I see the king do dear love he 
he weep 

sir the current of the water bear we far 
in three day than I be able to return in ten 

give the poor hermit something 
though his news deserve it not 
yet his suffering do 
it be a addition to my grief that when I part 
with he last I seem to be offend with he 
for his dotage on Clarinda which he have 
dear pay for and yet I can blame he 
for she be the fair creature that yet I ever see 
o sister we have lose our dear kinsman 
and that which add unto my grief be that I can 
be revenge on he that kill he 

be you certain sir that he be dead or 
who it be that kill he 

too certain of they both 
it be Lysander that kill he 
who if I ever get within my power 
the sharp kind of death that justice can inflict 
upon he he shall feel 

say you so brother he shall 
not come within your power if I can help it then 
but royal brother if the duke have kill Lysander 
I know you will have pardon he 

sister I think I shall 

with what justice then can you pursue 
Lysander life who as the duke himself 
inform you in his letter seek 
only to maintain what be his own 
but on the other side the duke like a usurper 
without any title will have take from he 
that which he value far above his life 
his love 

it be not I 
that pursue Lysander life but justice 
the law condemn he to die 
have it be but a private man much more 
be so near a kin to i 

there be no law but do allow we to defend 
ourselves Lysander do no more for who can deny 
he be compel honour compel he 
the duke compel he and love which can be 
by noble mind resist do above all compel he 
then all the fault Lysander do commit in my 
opinion be that he be too slow need 
compulsion in so just a cause and therefore sir 
if you shall apprehend Lysander though by 
the letter of the law his life be forfeit 
yet remember that mercy be the great attribute 
belong to those power who substitute you be 

sister you often have have occasion 
to show your charity in be a suitor to i 
for the life of those that have offend 
yet until now you never beg my mercy unto any 

sir you never have occasion give you 
till now to whet the sword of justice by your own 
particular revenge that it may cut the deep 
and be not interest your mercy of itself 
do blunt the edge and need not my intercession 

I do conjure you by my love 
to speak no more of this unplease subject 
for if I get Lysander once within my power 
I will sacrifice his heartblood to the ghost 
of my decease cousin 

you know it be bootless 
the king be so incense in beg mercy 
for Lysander you may prove cruel to yourself 
and unto i your father 

o sir how ill you do requite Lysander 
his love to you be the only cause 
that pull these misery upon he 
for have not he so dear tender you 
fear to draw on you the king displeasure 
we have long since be marry than this unlucky 
combat have not be nor I have need of that 
which now I be to beg mercy great sir 

why know you where Lysander be 

o no but I do fear he can escape 
your hand 

why lady 
can you hope that if he be take 
I will pardon he have he not kill the man 
that in the world be near to my heart 
I can grant this rise and by my honour 
ask or command what be within my power 
but this and it shall be perform 

sir all the suit 
I will make since this can be grant be 
that in the self same hour that my Lysander 
be to suffer I who have be the fountain 
from whence these bloody stream have issue 
may be permit to show Lysander the dark 
yet please way to the elysian field 
for though we can not here yet there we shall 
enjoy each other 

Lysander shall thou prove false to she 
though I myself be cause of thy inconstancy 
yet I shall hate thou 

I hope you will better consider 
of the general loss the world shall sustain 
in lose such a jewel as yourself 
sister I will leave you to advise her better 
and pray you use she with your best respect 
her worth and beauty do deserve it 
my lord Utrante have you in your daughter name 
take possession of all that be the duke 
as I command 

my lord I have the full possession 
but she do utter refuse they 

I know my sister will advise 
her better exeunt manet Clar and Cleo 

the princess be the fair creature 
that yet my eye ever behold why do she look 
so steadfast upon i gracious madam 
what see you in this worthless frame 
that so attract your eye 

I see Clarinda 
in each particular of the whole frame 
which thou term worthless a excess of beauty 
which in another lady may breed envy 
but by my life I take delight to look on thou 

and madam may I perish 
if ere my eye yet meet a object wherein 
I take half that delight that I do now 
in look upon you be I a man 
and can frame to myself a mistress by my wish 
have the wide world to choose in for each 
particular to make up the whole I shall believe 
it be a fruitless labour if I go far 
than yourself thus frame 

Clarinda as I be sister to a king 
I see I must partake of their misfortune 
which be to be gross flatter but it may be 
you give i this fair language by instinct 
for I have please news to tell you 
if that you have come to court I think 
to have send for you which unto you 
I know appear most strange for till this hour 
I never have the happiness to see you 

madam it do indeed 

it will appear more strange 
when you shall know the cause for which 
I will have send for you 

dear lady what be it for 

I will have send for you 
to know what you will have give willing 
to one that will undertake to save Lysander life 

I can name you a particular 
but all that I have or can give 

I mean not good or money 
but can you be content if it be 
a woman that can do this 
to quit your interest in Lysander 
and give he leave to marry she 

if it shall come to that I know 
I soon shall be willing 
than I shall draw he to give his consent 

it be near it than you believe 
I know a lady that have save his life already 

how beg his pardon of the king 
and upon those condition have he give consent 

he have not yet but when he know 
your mind I think he will 

be she a handsome lady and well bear 

not very handsome but her birth be great 
in both she equal i and in affection to 
Lysander you 

madam I do beseech you 
leave this too harsh discourse for it hardly 
can be true since there be no lady 
in this kingdom that ever I see 
that equal you in beauty yet 
the imagination that it may be so 
do from my eye draw tear and chase 
from my heart the usual heat 

weep not Clarinda I can hold thou 
long in suspense I be the lady that I mean 
and therefore chase away thy fear 

I never see true cause of fear till now 
the tale you tell appear much likely truth 
now that you be the lady than it do before 
for you have in you that full excellency 
that will make god forswear themselves 
if they have make a oath shall you propose 
yourself as the reward of that their perjury 
shall I believe then that Lysander frailty 
can resist such a assault if you be so resolve 
beside what lady have the power to beg 
Lysander life at your incense brother hand 
but only you that be his sister 
go poor forsake maid and melt thyself 
away in tear and do not live to be a eyesore 
to this noble lady nor to upbraid Lysander 
with his falsehood 

stay sweet Clarinda 
and for as many tear as I have make thou shed 
from those fair eye so oft I will kiss the crystal 
fountain from whence they flow believe i 
dear maid though I do love Lysander 
yet I will not wrong thou for a world 
of which to give the more assurance 
thou shall see and speak with thy Lysander 
for thou be only worthy of he 
he be now at gerard lodge within the forest 
none know of it but Gerard and his own sister 
Mariana how I bring he thither wound 
I will take another time to tell you when you will 
see he you must go disguise farewell Clarinda 
be confident I love you dear I will stay 
no long lest it shall breed suspicion Exit 

madam your humble servant 
how strange a tale be this yet sure it be true 
why shall the princess say so else 
but can it be the princess love Lysander 
can it be otherwise if she do know he 
if it be true sure Lysander will not neglect 
so great a blessing hence jealousy the canker 
of true love that do in time consume that 
which do give thou be why shall I wrong 
Lysander to mistrust his faith till I have 
better cause I must to he and in disguise 
which how to get myself I know not 
I must trust somebody and who so fit 
as honest jacomo who I know love Lysander 
Come hither honest jacomo 

madam 

I know thou love i 
and will do any thing that I command thou 

madam I hope you make no doubt of it 

no thou shall see I do not doubt 
for I will make thou privy to a secret 
that torture shall not draw from i 

if it be that that I suspect torture shall 
hardly make i to conceal it 

what say thou jacomo 

madam I say although I shall be rack 
yet what you tell i shall be still conceal 

I know it shall come trusty jacomo 
I will tell thou all the story as we go exeunt 

how be I bind to thou for this disguise 
I think my father if I have meet he 
can not have know i how far be it 
yet to the lodge 

it be not above a mile but be you sure 
he be there 

I will not else have come so far a foot 
nor put on this disguise 

madam if you be weary here be a fair 
cool shade where you may rest yourself a while 

though I be faint and weary 
yet I will not stay the great desire I have 
to see Lysander do support my weakness 

but madam I be weary and I have 
no such strong desire as love to carry i 

for shame say not so can you be a man 
and use to walk be weary in so short a journey 

madam you must refresh i with a kiss 
I can walk else 

how jacomo 

why do not the pain that I have take 
deserve a great recompense than that 

I do confess 
the pain that thou have take and 
I intend thou a reward equal to it 
but it amaze i to hear thou ask 
that which will trouble i to give 
and yet to thou that shall receive it 
do not good at all 

if it will trouble you to give it then let 
i take a kiss 

how strange be thou transport 
with a fond desire 

you will not kiss i then 

I prithee be not angry jacomo 
I will give thou that which be better 
here take this jewel yet let i tell thou 
the duke will not thus bold have demand 
what thou do ask 

he be a fool then 
and do not know his own advantage 
which you shall find I do you that 
deny i now a kiss shall give i that 
which you perchance the first night 
will have deny your husband 

I do not like this what be that honest jacomo 

your maidenhead 

how I know thou do but speak this 
for to excuse thyself from go sit still 
I will find the way myself 

be you so crafty stay and hear i 

what say thou honest jacomo 

not too honest neither I know you be wise and therefore I will use no persuasion else but only let of you see the danger 

o I fear this villain 

Lysander you tell i be at the lodge and there the king shall find he except you will redeem he from that danger by the loss of your virginity I know you will be well content to kiss i now but now it will not serve 

will honest jacomo then prove a villain 

who will not prove a villain for so sweet a recompense how I do glory in this purchase of my wit the duke strive to gain the happiness I shall have offer i pay down his life for it beside he go about the ceremonial way of marriage but I shall meet my happiness a near way which will be a addition to the pleasure Come be you resolve 

why villain do thou prize Lysander life 
above my honour 

if for a word for honour be no more 
you can endure to see Lysander suffer cruel death 
it seem you love he little do as you will 
make haste unto the lodge you know the way well 
the king may chance be there before you 
as I will handle the business 

stay jacomo can thou be such a villain 
as thou do seem I do not think 
thou be in earnest 

all torment that man do ever feel 
light upon i if I do not perform 
what I say 

then may they all light on thou

no matter sir 
I be the mistress of the field this day 
my brother not be here and I will 
have it so the sore that the chase be 
my be absent will the less be mark horn 

brother methinks now your wound be well 
it be good to quit this country for a while 
for it be impossible but by some mean or other 
if you stay hear you will be discover 

sister it be my intent but I without 
the princess leave who have preserve my life 
will certain resolve of nothing 

the time have be that you without 
clarinda leave will have do nothing 

and be so still 
for may I perish when I prove false 
to my Clarinda yet shall I say I do not 
love the princess and with some passion too 
I shall but lie see where she come 
and with the splendour of her heavenly eye 
amaze my weak sense not Diana self 
look half so lovely when she woo 
the palefaced boy Endymion 
nor Pallas when she stand competitor 
with the two goddess to gain the golden apple 
appear with half that majesty 
that she do thus attire hold faith 
thou never be in such a danger 

Lysander I be glad to see you thus 
recover I glory in my cure 

madam I be so well 
that I desire your licence to depart 
there be danger sure in my be here 
both to yourself and i 

Lysander I know you do but jest 
for shall I give you leave I know 
you will not go 

madam it be best we part shall I stay here 
and daily look upon those sunbright eye 
and hear your charm tongue my faith I fear 
will prove like wax and melt clarinda picture 
will be soon deface and I shall then deserve 
the hate of all the world 

Lysander do not fear it you shall this day 
see fair Clarinda who merit will arm you 
too strong to misdoubt a change 

do your grace see she then 

yes Lysander I see Clarinda 
who perfection have compel the heaven 
in justice to give she the most deserve man alive 
to be her servant 

madam it be true 
she have indeed the most deserve man 
that then do live the duke give to she 
for a servant but when the heaven see 
that she do refuse he who they know 
be only worthy of she they leave she then 
to her unhappy choice in i in which 
she can fail to be miserable 
and that they may torment she with 
the knowledge of her error they take from 
the earth unto themselves who she refuse 
make he equal unto one of they 

Lysander 
I will give you leave to praise the duke 
because it still tend to your great praise 
since you do overcome he both by your valour 
and your other merit for fair Clarinda 
who judgement be complete esteem you 
for the worthy Lysander never be there man 
so bless as you be in a master for it be 
as impossible to equal she in love 
as in perfection for though she know that her 
perfection far transcend i yet her 
excess of love do make her jealous 
whenas I tell she I have save your life 
and how but I to show she that I love 
you only as a brother do tell she where 
you be and much I wonder that she 
be not come 

it may be she do wise fear that there 
be some that watch each step she make 
hope by that to find i out for now 
it be no news that she do love i 
when I be at Florence I will send her word 
for so I promise she in a letter when I go 
to fight if that I escape with life 

you shall not go to Florence today 
yet do so and be not sad to go 
for when my brother passion be once over 
and that he shall consider the justness 
of the duke request in his last letter 
I mean your pardon he can sure 
be any long cruel 

why madam 
do he write a letter to the king 
in which he beg my pardon 

yes Lysander he do 
and the last word that ere he speak be 
to that purpose the letter I can show you 
I never till this day can get it from my brother 

he in this letter do express himself 
to be so near the composition of the god 
so fill with all perfection methinks it be strange 
they shall not build he altar yet my infortunate 
hand do rob the world of this precious jewel 
for which offence my heart shall drop in justice 
as many bloody tear as now my womanish tear 
do drop of brinish water 

worthy Lysander 
each pearl like drop fall from thy manly eye 
may expiate a great sin than that thou do 
commit in thy intention I can choose 
but kiss thou for this noble sorrow say Mariana 
have I do ill to kiss your brother 

madam it be in i presumption 
to censure any of your action 

Lysander must you go today 
sure you do not love i as a sister else 
you will not part so soon 

by this kiss which I believe shall be 
the last that I ever shall be bless with 
do not my faith oblige i otherways 
I shall love you equal with Clarinda 
nay have I know you first I shall 
have love you better but as it be 
I know you be so noble in you self 
that you will hate i if I shall prove inconstant 

it be true it be a baseness for which 
my judgement will condemn you as unworthy 
to be belove but yet I think my passion 
will make i change that say of love 
of the treason yet hate of the traitor 
for I shall hate the treason and yet I fear i 
too much love the traitor 

it be impossible that you shall love 
a perjure man 

I do but fear it 
I know your worth will never put it to the trial 

dear princess 
Gerard to who I be much bind 
have horse ready for i so that there be 
nothing want but your leave to make 
my journey happy 

which I unwilling do grant you yet 
pray the heaven to make your journey prosperous 
o Mariana will I have never see thy brother 
or have see he that I may enjoy he 
for my husband but I do ill to wish another

who threaten to hang up Gerard for conceal 
of my brother 

dear madam hide yourself 
what will the king your brother say 
if he do find you here 

I will Lesander fly from his anger now 
that I may have more power hereafter 
to do thou service what will you do Lysander

so that you be safe from the king anger 

sir set the house round lest he shall escape 
at some back door 

be that thy charge take half the guard I will search 
the house myself where be this bloody traitor

mind man that do not yet deserve the title 
of a traitor I know it be i you look for 

bloody villain it be thou indeed 
lay hand on he 

keep off and hear i speak first 
and then I will deliver up my sword 

what will thou say 

I see poor Gerard bind who I 
compel to conceal i 

how can thou compel he 

royal sir with patience hear i 
when I by the assistance of fortune not my valour 
yet I do nothing base have kill that noble duke 
I be myself sore wound so that I can not 
fly out of your territory and well I know 
into what house soever I come though they 
at first may pity i not know 
what I have do yet when they once shall know 
that I have kill the duke they then I know 
will straight discover i rather to gain reward 
or else to save themselves from future danger 
which to prevent I think my safe course be 
for to compel Gerard who well I know 
live far remote from company to swear 
not to discover I be in his house 
or else I threaten straight to kill he 
hope that rather than he will forswear 
himself he will conceal i wherein I be 
no whit deceive 

if please your majesty 
he come into my house before I be aware 
with his sword draw and set of it 
to my breast threaten if I will not swear 
for to conceal he to kill i instant 
I not know what he have do 
swear all that he will have i 

a God transform into a humane shape 
can do or say no more than he have do 

but when thou know that he have 
kill the duke how dare thou then 
conceal he 

I then begin to fright he with strange 
example of the cruel punishment that perjure 
man have feel and awe his conscience that way 

So thou do i Lysander 
for I have make a vow after that I have get thou 
once within my power the sun shall not 
twice set till I have with a sacrifice of thy heart blood 
appease my kinsman ghost I dare not 
be forswear away with he to prison 
and Gerard exeunt Lys Ger and guard 

it be then no time for to conceal myself 
o cruel brother you have in that rash oath 
murder all virtue that Man frail nature 
be capable to receive 

I be amaze 
tell i dear sister what make you here 
I hope you know not of this villainy 

o do not call a demigod a villain

by a barbarous thief kill he that will 
have robe he for so Lysander do and 
whereas you call he ingrate there you do 
err the duke be his debtor and so 
indeed be all the world for he have leave they 
such a story in his action that he that can 
but read and imitate they to the life 
shall in another just age be make a god 
and worship for his virtue 

sister do you but see how ill 
these praise do become you for you indeed

in the forest and will have show he 
the way to gerard lodge but lose myself 
and wander up and down till now 

here here be some meat 
I be myself at gerard lodge and see those 
there who you will little think 

who be there 

the king and his fair sister 
Lysander bind as a prisoner for kill 
of the duke 

o my Lysander lost false

please sir to leave i here I will go to bed 
no child I will help thou 

if he shall see my breast I be undo 
I will keep on my doublet 

go to bed sweet child we will leave thou exeunt 

what news at court 

sad news believe i 

why must brave Lysander suffer today 

the king have swear to have his head off ere sunset 

the kingdom will be poor in such a loss 
for he leave none behind he worth his equal 

ay but be it not strange the king shall grace 
that villain jacomo that do betray he 

his extreme love unto the duke make he 
love jacomo who do profess that he do not 
discover Lysander in hope of gain but only 
out of love to the duke memory 

at one of the clock he be to suffer let we be there betimes and get a place near the scaffold to hear his last word exeunt 

how black and sorrowful this day look 
this day in which Lysander be to suffer 
noble Lysander to who my child and I 
be so much bind and yet he be the cause 
of both our ruin or rather I be cause 
it be my ambition to have a duke 
my son in law no it be my clarinda 
beauty breed all this mischief and it be 
the heaven that give beauty to she 
why do they then not bless that gift in she 
but turn it to her curse peace wretched man 
and argue not with those high power 
but wait their pleasure and pray for their assistance 
who can yet change this Scoene of blood into 
a scene of joy and back return thou thy Clarinda 

if it please your lordship my young lady 
be return and go again 

how 

she have be in the house this hour as the maid tell i have change her clothes and his new steal out at the backgate and go towards Lysander prison two of my fellow be go after she and I come back to tell your lordship Exit 

and do the king cruel resolution hold still 

o madam yes my poor brother must die today 

and will not thou die with he speak Mariana 

madam I can wish that I may not outlive he 

why say thou thou can wish have thou not hand 
or do thou want a knife if so yet there be many way to die 

madam how strange do you talk 

why will thou wish to live 
after the untimely death of such a brother 

madam we must not go until the god do call we 
yet I believe it be the better place 

the better place assure thyself of that they will 
not else thus early call thither the best of man I will follow 
he where ere he go to see enter jacomo 

madam the king desire your company 

villain have he none else to send but thou 
that do betray Lysander hence from my sight exeunt 

what do you with the boy 

I leave he at the count Utrante house 
he tell i he dwell there 

at what hour say they must Lysander suffer 

at on of the clock fail not to be there 
and get near the scaffold 

you need not bid i exeunt 

sister believe i you have tell i such particular 
argument of Lysander worth that I do pity 
his misfortune much and have quite lose my anger 
yet justice must be satisfy 

sir the offence that he commit be but against 
the law although he robe you of a subject 
you be above the law and may remit it 
a king shall in point of life and death 
be like the chancery in other case and help 
by mercy against the cruel letter of the law 
as the chancery do by conscience 
especial when your own conscience tell you 
that he be force against his will to fight 

sister it be a example too dangerous 
to pardon he that kill my next of blood 
it may encourage some to strike myself 
and therefore it be in vain to plead for mercy 

o daughter let not your passionate love 
unto Lysander make you accuse good jacomo 

o sir you be cozen he be a devil incarnate 
justice justice great sir 

lady I think your plea will have be mercy 
and not justice 

sir I have lose all hope of mercy but justice 
I hope you will grant i against that villain jacomo 

now have at i but I have forearm the king with such a tale that and my own impudence which never fail i shall well enough defend i 

arise fair Clarinda and by my crown 
bring your sufficient proof you shall have justice 
but well I know you hate good jacomo because he do 
discover where your Lysander be 

will I have bite my tongue out of my head 
when I give it power to tell you where Lysander be 

your majesty may mark by this how true the rest be that she have to say madam than you will seem as if I have deceive your trust and that you have to i discover where Lysander be make i not so odious I never be a traitor have you to i discover it wild horse shall have tear i in a thousand piece ere I will have confess no this same country fellow one day be within the lodge see he and so discover it to i 

though thou deny this with a brazen brow 
yet thou can not deny thou will have ravish i 
when I do trust thou to go along with i 
I be disguise then where I to thou discover 
when Lysander be and more thou threaten 
if I do not give consent to thy base lust 
to murder i when thou have do 
because I shall not tell 

madam I do not think that love to any man can ever have turn that excellent wit of you so ill away as thus unjust to accuse a man that be innocent and one that honour you 

sir I do grieve 
my daughter love unto Lysander shall 
move she for to seek a most unjust revenge 
against good jacomo who like for honesty 
I know not in this kingdom of his quality 

sir here be a witness that will confirm 
what I have say for truth 

what gentle lady 

sir it be I that you rescue yesterday 
from a villain that will have ravish i 

why lady be you in such danger 

mark you sir she know of no such thing 

I be the boy you find in the wood 
who this villain will then have ravish 
which then I tell you be my master 

I think no boy can have so sweet a face 
indeed sir it be most true I find this lady bind 
and that same villain as I think for I have but 
a glimpse of he in the bush his fear make 
he fly as soon as ever he see i 

I beseech your majesty let he be hang 
for on my honour what I do affirm be truth 

your affirmation be to i a hundred 
witness yet it be in i injustice to deny 
the combat against this gentleman that do accuse 
he on your behalf if jacomo desire it 

believe it sir he that will do such villainy 
will never dare to fight sir send he to the galley 
if he will nor fight it show his guilt 

hell take you all I dare not fight may I have all the world give I will rather to the galley I shall get out there with some trick or other and then I will poison twenty of you I will not discover what I be that will but show i more 

let he that rescue Clarinda have the land 
that jacomo shall have have for discover where 
Lysander be call forth the prisoner and proceed to execution 

weep not Clarinda you may live happy 
you and the princess may together make 
a kind of marriage each one strong 
flatter themselves the other be Lysander 
for each of you be Lysander better part 
pardon Clarinda that I borrow from 
that stream of love a part to pay the princess 
which ever yet run constant to the ocean 
of thy perfection only for now a gratefulness 
to she make some of it run in another current 
for which I know thou be wise can never 
love i less know that I have love enough 
for both since I can marry neither 

Lysander do not think I grudge that part of love 
you pay the princess her merit fair transcend i 
beside you owe she for preserve of your life 
and I have be the only cause that you must lose it 
but I will bear you company and in that pay the debt I owe you 

why stay the prisoner 

only to take 
a part kiss then when you please I be prepare 

what mean you sister will yond make apparent 
to the world your folly 

sir do not hinder i 
for if I may not here speak with he 
we will converse in death soon than you believe 
Lysander thou be go to thy last home 
and in thou all virtuous man must suffer 
they be but branch thou the root of all perfection 
who will be courteous valiant since these be cause 
of thy death for thou unto the world do manifest 
in thy last action with the duke that thou be 
real possess of these but I in sum up thy worth 
do but increase my grief since I must part with thou 
the rich unhappy owner for they have only serve 
to revive thou and those that love thou for they 
poor Clarinda I from my own conception 
can weep to think upon the torment thou will feel 
whenas the axe shall sever from thou love 
worthy person thy comely head worthy 
most worthy in that it be the cabinet appoint 
by the god to keep their rich jewel in 
his mind which be indeed a index 
in which judicious man may read as in a book 
the whole content of all their excellence 

sister for shame do not thus wrong 
yourself and i by throw such high praise 
on a man condemn by law Lysander 
prepare thyself to die and take no notice of her 
idle praise which if they can to any mortal 
man be due they be to he for who 
thou now must suffer 

sir I do confess it and be ready to receive your doom 

I need not to a mind so fortify as thou be 
give any antidote to arm thou against death 

all the encouragement that I will desire 
shall be a kiss of your fair hand 

Lysander thou know my soul embrace thou 
these be the first tear that ere fall from my eye 
although a woman which I be please with 
since it well express this be the great grief 
that yet I ever feel 

this kiss Clarinda be thy due thou be 
the near to my heart in justice Clarin swoon 

look to Clarinda carry she home 

I think she will have outgo i but now 
mine shall be the glory who will live in a world 
that be bankrupt of all virtue Lys kneel 

I pray sir forgive i your death 

friend do thy office I forgive thou 

hold villain 

how dare thou hinder the sword of justice 
from light where it be design 

sir if you execute this lord you be a tyrant 

why sir will it be tyranny in i 
to execute the law the fellow be mad 
lay hand on he 

it be a cruel law that do condemn the innocent 

why be he innocent 

let i die for it if I do not prove 
he do not kill the duke 

and by my crown since thou do interpose thyself 
betwixt the sword of justice and the object 
it shall cut through thy life too with Lysander 
if thou do fail to prove what thou affirm 

I do beseech your majesty 
let not this frantic man for so he seem to be 
out of his love to i ruin himself 
I do confess again it be this unlucky hand 
and no other that kill the duke 

I call the heaven to witness it be I 
that be the cause he bleed that day 
and well he do deserve it for think 
so unjust to rob thou of Clarinda 
who only do deserve she 

Carry the fellow hence 
do I sit here to hear a mad man talk 

call i not fellow I be as good 
a gentleman as be the duke your cousin 
and be he now alive he will acknowledge it 

away with he to prison I will have he 
strange punish for this presumption 
away with he 

sir upon my credit 
and man of my profession shall not lie he be both 
in birth and worth equal unto the duke 

though I do reverence your profession 
yet I see no cause to believe you 
for in this kingdom there be none so worthy 

sir yes every way as worthy 
and one your majesty do love so well 
that if he ask you I know you will pardon 
lord Lysander for his sake 

sure all the world be infect 
one that I love so well and equal to the duke

if thou oblige i to become thy subject 
by give i Lysander that I shall 
more extol thy power then any subject

power than thou do overrule the destiny

I may have know thou by thy villainy 
through thy disguise 

good my lord proceed unto your discovery 

my second wife be barren I have 
no hope of issue male for I have Mariana 
there by my first and it do grieve my soul 
to think that villain there shall be my heir 
for he daily practise mischief before unheard of 
it be not long before my wife observe 
that the chief cause of all my discontent 
grow from her barrenness and she be fearful 
that my affection may decline as do my hope 
of issue thought of a strange and most unwonted 
mean to make herself appear a happy mother 
my friend wife here the count Utrante 
find herself to be with child my wife 
by help of art do seem so too but strange 
to see how gold will work for by a some of 
money my wife do work the midwife nurse 
and doctor to cozen the true mother of her child 
when ere she shall be bring to bed 

How be that possible 

most easy sir as they do handle it 
the child be bear and prove a boy 
as my wife wish for have it be a girl 
it can not then have ease i of my grief 
my land be tie upon the heir male 

good sir proceed 

the nurse be by the doctor straight 
command to carry into the next room the child 
allege that it be most necessary 
the mother after so much labour shall 
sleep which the child cry might hinder 
within a short space come in the midwife 
pitiful weep tell the mother 
that the child can hardly live but straight 
the nurse she enter the chamber cry out 
alas the child be dead the woeful mother 
fall in a swoon have almost make 
that sorrow real for she which then but 
counterfeit for the child 

the child then be not dead 

no sir the crafty nurse 
have by a backdoor convey it out of the house 
by help of another nurse that she have there 
for the purpose have recover 
the mother out of her trance the poor lady 
desire to see her late comfort though now 
her only cause of sorrow the dead child 
but the doctor utter deny that 
allege that will but increase her sorrow 
which may impeach her health 
my friend here be not then at home 
and who dare contradict the doctor 
in such a case 

be there 
no servant in the house do none of they 
ask for the child 

sir to prevent that 
they have before provide a piece of wood 
shape like a child and about that they put 
a wind sheet 

but what excuse then make they 
for their haste in dress of it 
for the grave that be not then 
scarce cold 

for that they tell the servant 
the child be deform they make such haste 
to hide it from the neighbour that they 
may not be witness of their lady shame 
in bring such a monster into the world 
the nurse the same night come and tell my wife 
what they have do and she advise with 
her agent the next night after seem 
to fall in labour and by the help of those 
her creature make perfect by their former practice 
she cozen i and the world by make we 
believe that she have true bring i forth a son 
I do a thousand time kiss my young heir 
and by my careful education and his own 
brave natural part he be grow to be 
what now you find Lysander for he be the same 

but how come you to know 
Lysander be not your natural son and these particular 

my wife sir 
be upon her death bed she find her conscience 
trouble with this deceit and can not 
depart in peace till she have free tell i 
of this strange story I still conceal it 
out of my just anger against my wicked brother 
beside that great affection which I bear Lysander 
continue still and be now so great 
that if your majesty by your prerogative 
will but confirm it I do adopt he for my heir 

it shall 

thus sir be I defeat of my right my lord the duke there by his power though I do prove this in the open court by witness of the nurse and midwife yet he make i to be banish as a injurer of other 

I do confess the wrong I do thou 
though ignorant and for to make thou satisfaction 
I will be a suitor to the king in thy behalf 
sir now upon my knowledge I dare affirm 
that Lysander be son unto the count Utrante 

it be nature in i that make i so much 
love the count Utrante you blessing sir 

it do not grieve i that you be my brother 

and for my part I can add 
to my own happiness if I may have my wish 
now that you be my sister for I do ever love you 
as a sister rather then as a mistress 

divine Clarinda 
I can claim your promise till a month be pass 
there be some part of it to come but I hope 
you will not strict stand upon the time 

my lord 
I shall too much wrong myself though I do not 
love you in defer of so great a blessing 
but the large testimony that you have give 
both of your worth and affection to i 
have turn that great affection in a instant 
that I bear Lysander as you can wish it 
upon you nay to say truth I ever love you 
though not so well as he and hold your worth as great 

dear Clarinda give i not a surfeit 

I fear the king will here consent whisper 

but good sir 
what make you desire i to beg your pardon 
or what make you conceal yourself so long 

my lord I will tell you 
your lordship may remember for it be not 
five year since that this my friend the count 
Utrante and myself be both suspect 
for poison of your child because we be 
his profess enemy especial myself 
which make i fly though I be innocent 
for it be know to many that the villain 
kill he for his own particular revenge 
yet my wicked brother there persuade the fellow 
at his death to say that we have set he on 
and get another rascal to witness with he 
that it be true my friend not have so great 
enemy do stay to justify himself 
and for his pain be lay in prison and keep there 
for his land till you get he release 
and yet he be never bring unto his trial 
ay ere I leave this country do leave this cabinet 
with my son or rather you and withal 
the charge of look in it when he shall 
be marry after many a weary step abroad 
I come home to my country and in disguise 
have live here in the forest and see my friend 
full often although they know not i 
and have this occasion of do your lordship 
service I think it will be a sure mean 
to get my pardon especial when thing 
be grow unto the extreme point 
of danger I know a timely remedy will be 
most welcome then of all and that make i 
conceal myself so long 

we be resolve 

my lord I free pardon you for I believe 
it be indeed a lie invent by your wicked 
brother who I do give you power to punish 
as you think good 

my lord I then desire 
he may be keep a prisoner all his life 
for shall he have his liberty I know 
he will do mischief that we shall all repent of 

brother thou be wise 
thou shall have be the first that shall 
have feel my anger 

away with he 

I dare not speak for thou thou be so great 
a villain exeunt guard with jacomo 

Come let we set forward to the temple 
and pray the god to shower a blessing 
upon this couple what mean my sister 

thus sir 
Lysander and myself have make a solemn 
contract and with our blood we will seal it 
either to go thus to the temple to be marry 
or to the grave 

how sister 

what be it sir in your opinion make 
Lysander unworthy of i 

his blood compare with you be base 

but sir his mind be heroic 
and who will compare the servant with the master 
the body be no more unto the mind 

what will you marry with a subject 

who will not 
marry with a subject that be a king of virtue 
rather than with a king that be govern 
by his vice 

sir you know the greatness of her 
spirit if you will have she to live you must 
consent 

brother you stand to we 
instead of destiny for you have in your power 
our thread of life say will you spin we out 
a happy thread that we may live to serve you 
or will you cut it short 

o be not cruel to your only sister 
what be all the out ward glory if you rob 
the mind of that which it delight in 
I know that your intention be to make 
her happy do not mistake the way 
her mind be not take with the glorious title 
of a king for if it have she may have make 
her choice since all the neighbour king 
admire she no sir she aim at that 
which make man king at first wisdom 
and valour and shall she search the world 
she can find a man where they 
do meet so full as in brave Lysander 
oh sir then be not cruel think to be 
careful of your sister 

she be cruel to herself 
and rather let she perish by her rash hand 
then so dishonour i by marry with 
a subject 

farewell then 
cruel brother Lysander let we part 
to meet again for ever I will go first 
because my brother shall not think of save i 
when you be dead 

no madam 
let i show you the way and when I feel 
the pain I will tell you if it be too great 
for you to suffer 

hold take he sister 
and be happy in he I love thou more 
than ever because I see thy mind be only 
fix on true worth without addition 
I learn of count Orsinio to bring thing 
to the extreme point so to increase 
the joy it have be a sin to part 
those body who very soul seem to be 
join together 

brother may I perish 
when I forget this benefit or cease to pay 
to you my lord my thanks for plead so 
Lysander cause and i 

great love this day have show his mighty power 
without the help of fortune in a hour

four of his true subject and make fair 
this day that be overcloud let we praise 
his power that in in a minute so can raise 
from misery to a excess of joy 
and in a instant that content destroy 
he have to we be just this day as well as kind 
reward virtuous love let none then call he blind
