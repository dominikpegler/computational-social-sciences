and rush forth bring in the errant knight 
and set he down in a enchant chair 
then with a engine which he have prepare 
with forty tooth he claw his courtly crown 
next make he wink and underneath his chin 
he plant a brazen piece of mighty board 
and knock his bullet round about his cheek 
while with his finger and a instrument

of Pompiana his belove daughter 
but yet prove constant to the black thumed maid
