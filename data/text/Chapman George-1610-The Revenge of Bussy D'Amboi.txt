to what will this decline kingdom turn 
swinge in every licence as in this 
stupid permission of brave de Ambois murder 
murder make parallel with law murder use 
to serve the kingdom give by suit to man 
for their advancement suffer scarecrowlike 
to fright adultery what will policy 
at length bring under his capacity 

all thing for as when the high birth of king 
deliverance and coronation 
we celebrate with all the city bell 
jangle together in untune confusion 
all order clock be tie up so when glory 
flattery and smooth applause of thing ill 
uphold the inordinate swinge of downright power 
justice and truth that tell the bound use 
virtuous and well distinguish form of time 
be gage and tonguetied but we have observe 
rule in more regular motion thing most lawful 
be once most royal king seek common good 
man manly liberty though never so mean 
and have their own swinge so more free and more 
but when pride enter they and rule by power 
all brow that smile beneath they frown heart grieve 
by imitation virtue quite be vanish 
and all man study selflove fraud and vice 
then no man can be good but he be punish 
tyrant be still more fearful of the good 
then of the bad their subject virtue ever 
manage with curb and danger and esteem 
as shadow and detraction to their own 

now all be peace no danger now what follow 
idleness rust we since no virtuous labour 
end ought reward ease security 
now all the palm wear we make war before 
so to prevent war man with give gift 
more than receive make our country strong 
our matchless race of soldier then will spend 
in public war not private brawl their spirit 
in dare enemy arm with mean arm 
not court strumpet and consume birthright 
in apishness and envy of attire 
no labour then be harsh no way so deep 
no rock so steep but if a bird can scale it 
up will our youth fly to a foe in arm 
stir up a much more lust of his encounter 
then of a mistress never so bepaint 
ambition then be only scale wall 
and overtop turret fame be wealth 
best part best deed be best nobility 
honour with worth and wealth well get or none 
country we win with as few man as country 
virtue subdue all 

just and then our noble 
love virtue so they praise and use it to 
have rather do then say their own deed hear 
by other glorify then be so barren 
that their part only stand in praise other 

who can not do yet praise and envy not 
civil behaviour flourish bounty flow 
avarice to upland boor slave hangman banish 

it be now quite otherwise but to note the cause 
of all these foul digression and revolt 
from our first nature this it be in a word 
since good art fail craft and deceit be use 
man ignorant be idle idle man 
most practise what they most may do with ease 
fashion and favour all their study aim 
at get money which no wise man ever 
feed his desire with 

yet now none be wise 
that think not heaven true foolish weigh with that 
well thou most worthy to be great Guise 
make with thy greatness a new world arise 
such depress noble follower of his 
as you myself my lord will find a time 
when to revenge your wrong 

I make no doubt 
in mean time I can wish the wrong be right 
of your slay brother in law brave Bussy de Ambois 

that one accident be make my charge 
my brother Bussy sister now my wife 
by no suit will consent to satisfy 
my love of she with marriage till I vow 
to use my utmost to revenge my brother 
but Clermont de Ambois Bussy second brother 
have since his apparition and excitement 
to suffer none but his hand in his wreak 
which he have vow and so will needs acquit 
i of my vow make to my wife his sister 
and undertake himself Bussy revenge 
yet loathe any way to give it act 
but in the noble and most manly course 
if the earl dare take it he resolve to send 
a challenge to he and myself must bear it 
to which delivery I can use no mean 
he be so barricado in his house 
and arm with guard still 

that mean lay on i 
which I can strange make my last land sale 
by his great suit stand now on price with he 
and he as you know pass covetous 
with that blind greediness that follow gain 
will cast no danger where her sweet foot tread 
beside you know his lady by his suit 
woo as fresh as when first love shoot 
his faultless arrow from her rosy eye 
now live with he again and she I know 
will join with all help in her friend revenge 

no doubt my lord and therefore let i pray you 
to use all speed for so on needle point 
my wife heart stand with haste of the revenge 
be as you know full of her brother fire 
that she imagine I neglect my vow 
keep off her kind embrace and still ask 
when when will this revenge come when perform 
will this dull vow be and I vow to heaven 
so stern and so past her sex she urge 
my vow performance that I almost fear 
to see she when I have a while be absent 
not show she before I speak the blood 
she so much thirst for freckle hand and face 

get you the challenge write and look from i 
to hear your passage clear no long time after 

all restitution to your worthy lordship 
who errand I must carry to the king 
as have swear my service in the search 
of all such malcontent and their design 
by seem one affect with their faction 
and discontent humour against the state 
nor do my brother Clermont escape my counsel 
give to the king about his guisean greatness 
which as I spice it have possess the king 
know his dare spirit of much danger 
charge in it to his person though my conscience 
dare swear he clear of any power to be 
infect with the least dishonesty 
yet that sincerity we politician 
must say grow out of envy since it can 
aspire to policy greatness and the more 
we work on all respect of kind and virtue 
the more our service to the king seem great 
in spare no good that seem bad to he 
and the more bad we make the most of good 
the more our policy search and our service 
be wonder at for wisdom and sincereness 
it be easy to make good suspect still 
where good and God be make but cloak for ill 
see monsieur take now his leave for Brabant 
the Guise and his dear minion Clermont D'Ambois 
whisper together not of state affair 
I dare lay wager though the Guise be now 
in chief heat of his faction but of some thing 
savour of that which all man else despise 
how to be true noble true wise 

see how he hang upon the ear of Guise 
like to his jewel 

he be now whisper in 
some doctrine of stability and freedom 
contempt of outward greatness and the guise 
that vulgar great one make their pride and zeal 
be only servile train and sumptuous house 
high place office 

contempt of these 
do he read to the Guise it be pass needful 
and he I think make show to affect his doctrine 

commend admire it 

And pursue another 
it be fine hypocrisy and cheap and vulgar 
know for a covert practice yet believe 
by those abuse soul that they teach and govern 
no more than wife adultery by their husband 
they bear it with so unmoved aspect 
hot come from it as it be not all 
or make by custom nothing this same D'Ambois 
have get such opinion of his virtue 
hold all learning but a art to live well 
and show he have learn it in his life 
be thereby strong in his persuade other 
that this ambitious Guise embrace he 
be think to embrace his virtue 

yet in some 
his virtue be hold false for the other vice 
for it be more cunning hold and much more common 
to suspect truth than falsehood and of both 
truth still fare worse as hardly be believe 
as it be unusual and rare know 

I will part engender virtue Men affirm 
though this same Clermont have a D'Ambois spirit 
and breathe his brother valour yet his temper 
be so much pass he that you can move he 
I will try that temper in he come you two 
devour each other with your virtue zeal 
and leave for other friend no fragment of you 
I wonder Guise you will thus ravish he 
out of my bosom that first give the life 
his manhood breathe spirit and mean and luster 
what do man think of i I pray thou Clermont 
once give i leave for trial of that love 
that from thy brother Bussy thou inherit 
to unclasp thy bosom 

as how sir 

be a true glass to i in which I may 
behold what thought the many headedbeast 
and thou thyself breathe out concern i 
my end and new upstart state in Brabant 
for which I now be bind my high aim 
imagine here in France speak man and let 
thy word be bear as naked as thy thought 
oh be brave Bussy live 

live my lord 

it be true thou be his brother but dare thou 
have brave the Guise maugre his presence court 
his wed lady empty even the dregs 
of his worst thought of i even to my tooth 
discern not i his rise sovereign 
from any common groom but let i hear 
my gross fault as grossful as they be 
dare thou do this 

I can tell a man 
do never know the goodness of his stomach 
till he see meat before he be I dare 
perhaps as he be I dare do like he 

Dare then to pour out here thy free soul 
of what I be 

it be stale he tell you it 

he only jest speak of spleen and envy 
thy soul more learned be more ingenuous 
search judicial let i then from thou 
hear what I be 

what but the sole support 
and most expectant hope of all our France 
the towards victor of the whole low country 

tush thou will sing encomion of my praise 
be this like D'Ambois I must vex the Guise 
or never look to hear free truth tell i 
for Bussy live not he dare anger i 
yet for my love will not have fear to anger 
the king himself thou understand i do not 

I shall my lord with study 

do understand thyself I pray thou tell i 
do never search thy thought what my design 
may be to entertain thou and thy brother 
what turn I mean to serve with you 

Even what you please to think 

but what think thou 
have I no end in it think 

I think you have 

when I take in such two as you two be 
a ragged couple of decay commander 
when a frenchcrown will plentiful serve 
to buy you both to any thing in the earth 

so it will you 

nay buy you both outright 
you and your trunk I fear i I offend thou 

no not a jot 

the most renown soldier 
Epaminondas as good author say 
have no more suit than back but you two share 
but one suit betwixt you both when both your study 
be not what meat to dine with if your partridge 
your snipe your woodcock lark or your red hear 
but where to beg it whether at my house 
or at the guise for you know you be 
ambitious beggar or at some cooksshop 
to eternize the cook trust and score it up 
do not offend thou 

no sir pray proceed 

as for thy gentry I dare bold take 
thy honourable oath and yet some say 
thou and thy most renown noble brother 
come to the court first in a keel of seacoal 
do not offend thou 

never doubt it sir 

why do I love thou then why have I rake thou 
out of the dunghill cast my cast wardrobe on thou 
bring thou to court to as I do thy brother 
make you my saucy bon companion 
teach you to call our great noble man 
by the corruption of their name jack Tom 
have I blow both for nothing to this bubble 
though thou be learn thou have no enchant wit 
or be thy wit good be I therefore bind 
to keep thou for my table 

well sir it be 
a good knight place many a proud dub gallant 
seek out a poor knight live from such emrods 
or what use else shall I design thou to 
perhaps you will answer i to be my pander 

perhaps I shall 

or do the sly Guise put thou 
into my bosom to undermine my project 
I fear thou not for though I be not sure 
I have thy heart I know thy brainpan yet 
to be as empty a dull piece of wainscot 
as ever arm the scalp of any courtier 
a fellow only that consist of sinew 
mere Swisser apt for any execution 

but kill of the king 

right now I see 
thou understand thyself 

I and you better 
you be a king son bear 

right 

and a king brother 

true 

and may not any fool have be so too 
as well as you 

a pox upon you 

you do not princely deed 
ere you be bear I take it to deserve it 
nor do you any since that I have hear 
nor will do ever any as all think 

the devil take he I will no more of he 

nay stay my lord and hear he answer you 

no more I swear farewell 

no more ill fortune 
I will have give a million to have hear 
his scoff retort and the insolence 
of his high birth and greatness which be never 
effect of his desert but of his fortune 
make show to his dull eye beneath the worth 
that man aspire to by their know virtue 
without which greatness be a shade a bubble 

but what one great man dream of that but you 
all take their birth and birthright leave to they 
acquire by other for their own worth purchase 
when many a fool in both be great as they 
and who will think they can win with their worth 
wealthy possession when win to their hand 
they neither can judge just of their value 
nor know their use and therefore they be puff 
with such proud tumour as this monsieur be 
enable only by the good they have 
to scorn all goodness none great fill their fortune 
but as those man that make their house great 
their household be less so fortune raise 
huge heap of outside in these mighty man 
and give they nothing in they 

true as truth 
and therefore they have rather drown their substance 
in superfluity of brick and stone 
like Sisyphus advance of they ever 
and ever pull down then lay the cost 
of any sluttish corner on a man 
build with God finger and enstile his temple 

it be noble say my lord 

I will have these thing 
bring upon stage to let mighty miser 
see all their grave and serious misery play 
as once they be in Athens and old Rome 

nay we must now have nothing bring on stage 
but puppetry and pied ridiculous antic 
man thither come to laugh and feed foolfat 
check at all goodness there as be profane 
when wheresoever goodness come she make 
the place still sacred though with other foot 
never so much it be scandal and pollute 
let i learn any thing that fit a man 
in any stable show as well as stage 

why be not all the world esteem a stage 

yes and right worthy and stage too 
have a respect due to they if but only 
for what the good greek moralist say of they 
be a man proud of greatness or of riches 
give i a expert actor I will show all 
that can within his great glory fall 
be a man afraid with poverty and lowness 
give i a actor I will show every eye 
what he lament so and so much do fly 
the best and worst of both if but for this then 
to make the proud outside that most swell 
with thing without he and above his worth 
see how small cause he have to be so blow up 
and the most poor man to be grieve with poorness 
both be so easy bear by expert actor 
the stage and actor be not so contemptful 
as every innovate Puritan 
and ignorant sweater out of zealous envy 
will have the world imagine and beside 
that all thing have be liken to the mirth 
use upon stage and for stage fit 
the splenative philosopher that ever 
laugh at they all be worthy the enstage 
all object be they never so full of tear 
he so conceit that he can distil thence 
matter that still feed his ridiculous humour 
hear he a lawyer never so vehement plead 
he stand and laugh hear he a tradesman swear 
never so thrifty sell of his ware 
he stand and laugh hear he a holy brother 
for hollow ostentation at his prayer 
never so impetuous he stand and laugh 
see he a great man never so insult 
severe inflict grave give law 
not for their good but he he stand and laugh 
see he a youthful widow 
never so weep wring of her hand 
for her lose lord still the philosopher laugh 
now whether he suppose all these presentment 
be only maskery and wear false face 
or else be simple vain I take no care 
but still he laugh how grave soever they be 

and may right well my Clermont and for this 
virtuous digression we will thank the scoff 
of vicious monsieur but now for the main point 
of your late resolution for revenge 
of your slay friend 

I have here my challenge 
which I will pray my brother Baligny 
to bear the murderous earl 

I have prepare 
mean for access to he through all his guard 

about it then my worthy Baligny 
and bring we the success 

I will my lord 

revenge that ever red sit in the eye 
of injure lady till we crown thy brow 
with bloody laurel and receive from thou 
justice for all our humour injury 
who wing none fly that wrath or tyranny 
have ruthless make and bloody enter here 
enter oh enter and though length of time 
never let we any escape thy constant justice 
yet now prevent that length fly fly and here 
fix thy steel footstep here oh here where still 
earth move with pity yield and embrace 
my love fair figure draw in his dear blood 
and mark the place to show thou where be do 
the cruel murder that ere flee the sun 
o earth why keep thou not as well his spirit 
to give his form life no that be not earthly 
that rarefy the thin and yield air 
fly sparkle up into the sphere of fire 
whence endless flame it shed in my desire 
here be my daily pallet here all night 
that can be wrest from thy rivals arm 
oh my dear Bussy I will lie and kiss 
spirit into thy blood or breathe out i 
in sigh and kiss and sad tune to thou 

still on this haunt still shall adulterous blood 
affect thy spirit think for shame but this 
this blood that cockatricelike thus thou brood 
to dry be to breed any quench to thou 
and therefore now if only for thy lust 
a little cover with a veil of shame 
look out for fresh life rather then witchlike 
learn to kiss horror and with death engender 
strange cross in nature pure virgin shame 
lie in the blood as lust lie and together 
many time mix too and in none more shameful 
than in the shamefaced who can then distinguish 
betwixt their affection or tell when he meet 
with one not common yet as worthy poet 
shun common and plebeian form of speech 
every illiberal and affect phrase 
to clothe their matter and together tie 
matter and form with art and decency 
so worthy woman shall shun vulgar guise 
and though they can but fly out for change 
yet modesty the matter of their life 
be it adulterate shall be paint true 
with modest outpart what they shall do still 
grace with good show though deed be never so ill 

that be so far from all you seek of we 
that though yourselves be common as the air 
we must not take the air we must not fit 
our action to our own affection 
but as geometrician you still say 
teach that no line nor superficies 
do move themselves but still accompany 
the motion of their body so poor wife 
must not pursue nor have their own affection 
but to their husband earnest and their jest 
to their austerity of look and laughter 
though never so foolish and injurious 
like parasite and slave fit their disposure 

I use thou as my soul to move and rule i 

So say you when you woo so soldier torture 
with tedious siege of some wellwalled town 
propound condition of most large content 
freedom of law all former government 
but have once set foot within the wall 
and get the reins of power into their hand 
then do they tyrannize at their own rude swinge 
seize all their good their liberty and life 
and make advantage and their lust their law 

but love i and perform a wife part yet 
with all my love before I swear forgiveness 

forgiveness that grace you shall seek of i 
these torture finger and these stabbedthrough arm 
keep that law in their wound yet unobserved 
and ever shall 

Remember their desert 

those with fair warning may have be reform 
not these unmanly rage you have hear 
the fiction of the north wind and the sun 
both work on a traveller and contend 
which have most power to take his cloak from he 
which when the wind attempt he roar out 
outrageous blast at he to force it off 
that wrap it close on when the calm sun 
the wind once leave charge he with still beam 
quiet and fervent and therein be constant 
which make he cast off both his cloak and coat 
like who shall man do if you wish your wife 
shall leave dislike thing seek it not with rage 
for that enrage what you give you have 
but use calm warning and kind manly mean 
and that in wife most prostitute will win 
not only sure amends but make we wife 
better than those that never lead faulty life 

my lord

wife welcome his lordship 

I much joy in your return here

in so good time yet 

death who have we here 
ho guard villain 

why exclaim you so 

negligent traitor murder murder murder 

you be mad have my intent be so like you 
it have be do ere this 

sir your intent 
and action too be rude to enter thus 

you be a decay lord to tell i of rudeness 
as much decay in manner as in mean 

you talk of manner that thus rude thrust 
upon a man that be busy with his wife 

And keep your lordship than the door 

the door 

sweet lord forbear show show your purpose sir 
to move such bold foot into other roof 

this be my purpose sir from Clermont D'Ambois 
I bring this challenge

I will leave it here then 

thou shall leave thy life first 

murder murder 

retire my lord get off 
hold or thy death shall hold thou hence my lord 

there lie the challenge 

be not this well handle 

noble my lord all thanks 

I will make he read it 

this be a sleight wellmasked 
o what be man 
unless he be a politician 

come Baligny we now be private say 
what service bring thou make it short the Guise 
who friend thou seem be now in court and near 
and may observe we 

this sir then in short 
the faction of the Guise with which my policy 
for service to your highness seem to join 
grow ripe and must be gather into hold 
of which my brother Clermont be a part 
exceed capital deserve to have 
a capital eye on he and as you may 
with best advantage and your speedy charge 
command his apprehension which because 
the court you know be strong in his defence 
we must ask country swinge and open field 
and therefore I have wrought he to go down 
to Cambray with i of which government 
your highness bounty make i your lieutenant 
where when I have he I will leave my house 
and fain some service out about the confine 
when in the mean time if you please to give 
command to my lieutenant by your letter 
to train he to some muster where he may 
much to his honour see for he your force 
put into battle when he come he may 
with some close stratagem be apprehend 
for otherwise your whole power there will fail 
to work his apprehension and with that 
my hand needs never be discern therein 

thank honest Baligny 

your highness know 
I will be honest and betray for you 
brother and father for I know my lord 
treachery for king be true loyalty 
nor be to bear the name of treachery 
but grave deep policy all act that seem 
ill in particular respect be good 
as they respect your universal rule 
as in the main sway of the universe 
the supreme rector general decree 
to guard the mighty globe of earth and heaven 
since they make good that guard to preservation 
of both those in their order and first end 
no man particular as he think wrong 
must hold he wrong no not though all man reason 
all law all conscience conclude it wrong 
nor be comparison a flatterer 
to liken you here to the king of king 
nor any man particular offence 
against the world sway to offence at you 
in any subject who as little may 
grudge at their particular wrong if so it seem 
for the universal right of your estate 
as be a subject of the world whole sway 
as well as you and be a righteous man 
to who heaven promise defence and blessing 
bring to decay disgrace and quite defenceless 
he may complain of heaven for wrong to he 

it be true the simile at all part hold 
as all good subject hold that love our favour 

which be our heaven here and a misery 
incomparable and most true hellish 
to live deprive of our king grace and countenance 
without which best condition be most curse 
life of that nature howsoever short 
be a most linger and tedious life 
or rather no life but a languish 
and a abuse of life 

it be well conceit 

I think it not amiss to yield your highness 
a reason of my speech lest perhaps 
you may conceive I flatter which I know 
of all ill under heaven you most abhor 

still thou be right my virtuous Baligny 
for which I thank and love thou thy advice 
I will not forget haste to thy government 
and carry D'Ambois with thou so farewell 

your majesty fare ever like itself 

my sure friend Baligny 

noble of prince 

how stand the state of Cambray 

strong my lord 
and fit for service for who readiness 
your creature Clermont D'Ambois and myself 
ride short down 

that Clermont be my love 
France never breed a noble gentleman 
for all part he exceed his brother Bussy 

ay my lord 

far because beside his valour 
he have the crown of man and all his part 
which learning be and that so true and virtuous 
that it give power to do as well as say 
whatever fit a most accomplish man 
which Bussy for his valour season lack 
and so be rapt with outrage oftentimes 
beyond decorum where this absolute Clermont 
though only for his natural zeal to right 
he will be fiery when he see it cross 
and in defence of it yet when he list 
he can contain that fire as hide in embers 

no question he be a true learned gentleman 

he be as true as tide or any star 
be in his motion and for his rare learning 
he be not as all else be that seek knowledge 
of taste so much deprave that they have rather 
delight and satisfy themselves to drink 
of the stream trouble wander never so far 
from the clear fount then of the fount itself 
in all Rome Brutus be revive in he 
who he of industry do imitate 
or rather as great Troy Euphorbus be 
after Pythagoras so be Brutus Clermont 
and be not Brutus a conspirator 

Conspirator my lord do that impair he 
Caesar begin to tyrannize and when virtue 
nor the religion of the god can serve 
to curb the insolence of his proud law 
Brutus will be the god just instrument 
what say the princess sweet Antigone 
in the grave greek tragedian when the question 
betwixt she and Creon be for law of king 
which when he urge she reply on he 
though his law be a king they be not god 
nor will she value Creon write law 
with God unwrit edict since they last not 
this day and the next but every day and ever 
where king law alter every day and hour 
and in that change imply a bound power 

well let we leave these vain dispute what 
be to be do and fall to do something 
when be you for your government in Cambray 

when you command my lord 

nay that be not fit 
continue your designment with the king 
with all your service only if I send 
respect i as your friend and love my Clermont 

your highness know my vow 

ay it be enough 

thus must we play on both side and thus hearten 
in any ill those man who good we hate 
king may do what they list and for king subject 
either exempt from censure or exception 
for 〈◊〉 〈◊〉 〈◊〉 ●c as no man worth can be just judge 
but when he shine in some authority ●●possibile est ●●n cognoscere ●●entem ac vo●●nt atem pri●●quam in ma●●stratibus appa●●t ●●pho Antig 
so no authority shall suffer censure 
but by a man of more authority 
great vessel into less be empty never 
there be a redundance past their continent ever 
these virtuoso be the poor creature 
for look how spinner weave out of themselves 
web who strange matter none before can see 
so these out of a unseen good in virtue 
make argument of right and comfort in she 
that clothe they like the poor web of a spinner 

now to my challenge what be the place the weapon 

soft sir let first your challenge be receive 
he will not touch nor see it 

possible 
how do you then 

leave it in his despite 
but when he see i enter so expectless 
to hear his base exclaim of murder murder 
make methinks noblesse lose in he quick bury 

they be the breathe sepulchre of noblesse 
no true noble man than lion picture 
hang up for sign be lion quo molliu• gunt eoscr• exit who know not 
that lion the more soft keep be more servile 
and look how lion close keep feed by hand 
lose quite the innative fire of spirit and greatness 
that lion free breath forage for prey 
and grow so gross that mastiff cur and mongrel 
have spirit to cow they so our soft french noble 
chain up in ease and numb security 
their spirit shrink up like their covetous fist 
and never open but domitianlike 
and all his base obsequious minion 
when they be catch though it be but fly 
beseek with their peasant love of gain 
rust at home and on each other prey 
be for their greatness but the great slave 
and none be noble but who scrape and save 

it be base it be base and yet they think they high 

so child mount on their hobbyhorse 
think they be ride when with wanton toil 
they bear what shall bear they a man may well 
compare they to those foolish greatspleened camel 
that to their high head beg of jove horn high 
who most uncomely and ridiculous pride 
when he have satisfy they can not use 
but where they go upright before they stoop Simil 
and bear their head much low for their horn 
as these high man do low in all true grace 
their height be privilege to all thing base 
and as the foolish poet that still write 
all his most selfloved verse in paper royal 
or parchment rule with lead smooth with the pumice 
bind rich up and string with crimson string 
never so bless as when he write and read 
the apeloved issue of his brain and never 
but joy in himself admire ever 
yet in his work behold he and he show 
like to a ditcher so these paint man 
all set on outside look upon within 
and not a peasant entrails you shall find 
more foul and mezeled nor more starve of mind 

that make their body fat I fain will know 
how many million of our other noble 
will make one Guise there be a true ten worthy 
who do not one act only blemish he 

one act what one 

one that though year past do 
stick by he still and will distain he ever 

good heaven wherein what one act can you name 
suppose his stain that I will not prove his luster 

to satisfy you it be the massacre 

the massacre I think it be some such blemish 

o it be heinous 

to a brutish sense 
but not a manly reason we so tender 
the vile part in we that the part divine 
we see in hell and shrink not who be first 
head of that massacre 

the Guise 

it be nothing so 
who be in fault for all the slaughter make 
in Ilium and about it Were the greek 
be it not Paris ravish the queen 
of Lacedaemon breach of shame and faith 
and all the law of hospitality 
this be the beastly slaughter make of man 
when truth be overthrow his law corrupt 
when soul be smother in the flatter flesh 
slay body be no more than ox slay 

differ not man from ox 

who say so 
but see wherein in the understanding rule 
of their opinion life and action 
in their community of faith and reason 
be not the wolf that nourish Romulus 
more humane than the man that do expose he 

that make against you 

not sir if you note 
that by that deed the action difference make 
betwixt man and beast and not their name nor form 
have faith nor shame all hospitable right 
be break by Troy Greece have not make that slaughter 
have that be save say a philosopher 
the Iliad and Odyssey have be lose 
have faith and true religion be prefer 
religious Guise have never massacre 

well sir I can when I meet with you 
but thus digress a little for my learning 
from any other business I intend 
but now the voyage we resolve for Cambray 
I tell the Guise begin and we must haste 
and till the lord Renel have find some mean 
conspire with the countess to make sure 
your swear wreak on her husband though this fail 
in my so brave command we will spend the time 
sometime in train out in skirmish 
and battle all our troop and company 
and sometime breathe your brave scotch run horse 
that great Guise give you that all the horse in France 
far overrun at every race and hunt 
both of the hare and deer you shall be honour 
like the great Guise himself above the king 
and can you but appease your greatspleened sister 
for our delay wreak of your brother slaughter 
at all part you will be welcome to your wonder 

I will see my lord the Guise again before 
we take our journey 

o sir by all mean 
you can be too careful of his love 
that ever take occasion to be raise 
your virtue past the reach of this age 
and rank you with the best of the ancient roman 

that praise at no part move i but the worth 
of all he can give other sphere in he 

he yet be think to entertain strange aim 

he may be well yet not as you think strange 
his strange aim be to cross the common custom 
of servile noble in which he be so ravish 
that quite the earth he leave and up he leap 
on Atlas shoulder and from thence look down 
view how far off other high one creep 
rich poor of reason wander all pale look 
and tremble but to think of their sure death 
their life so base be and so rank their breath 
which I teach Guise to heighten and make sweet 
with life dear odour a good mind and name 
for which he only love i and deserve 
my love and life which through all death I vow 
resolve this whatever change can be 
thou have create thou have rvinde i 

these troop and company come in with wing 
so many man so arm so gallant horse 
I think no other government in France 
so soon can bring together with such man 
methinks a man may pass the insult pillar 
of Bacchus and Alcides 

I much wonder 
our lord lieutenant bring his brother down 
to feast and honour he and yet now leave he 
at such a instance 

it be the king command 
for who he must leave brother wife friend all thing 

the confine of his government who view 
be the pretext of his command have need 
of no such sudden expedition 

we must not argue that the king command 
be need and right enough and that he serve 
as all true subject shall without dispute 

but know not he of your command to take 
his brother Clermont 

no the king will be 
express to conceal his apprehension 
from my lord governor observe you not 
again peruse the letter both you be 
make my assistant and have right and trust 
in all the weighty secret like myself 

it be strange a man that have through his life past 
so sure a foot in virtue and true knowledge 
as Clermont D'Ambois shall be now find trip 
and take up thus so to make his fall 
more steep and headlong 

it be virtue fortune 
to keep her low and in her proper place 
height have no room for she but as a man 
that have a fruitful wife and every year 
a child by she have every year a month 
to breathe himself where he that get no child 
have not a night rest if he will do well 
So let one marry this same barren virtue 
she never let he rest where fruitful vice 
spare her rich drudge give he in labour breath 
feed he with bane and make he fat with death 

I see that good life never can secure 
man from bad liver worst man will have best 
as ill as they or heaven to hell they will wrest 

there be a merit for this in the fault 
that Bussy make for which he do penance 
prove that these foul adulterous guilt will run 
through the whole blood which not the clear can shun 

I will therefore take heed of the bastard 
whole innocent race it be a fearful thing 
and as I be true bachelor I swear 
to touch no woman to the couple end 
unless it be i own wife or my friend 
I may make bold with he 

it be safe and common 
the more your friend dare trust the more deceive he 
and as through dewy vapour the sun form 
make the gay rainbow girdle to a storm 
so in heart hollow friendship even the sun 
to all good grow in society 
make he so glorious and divine name hold 
colour for all the ill that can be tell 

hark our last troop be come 

hark our last foot 

Come let we put all quick into battle 
and send for Clermont in who honour all 
this martial preparation we pretend 

we must bethink we ere we apprehend he 
beside our main strength of some stratagem 
to make good our severe command on he 
as well to save blood as to make he sure 
for if he come on his scotch horse all France 
put at the heel of he will fail to take he 

what think you if we shall disguise a brace 
of our best soldier in fair lackey coat 
and send they for he run by his side 
till they have bring he in some ambuscado 
we close may lodge for he and sudden 
lay sure hand on he pluck he from horse 

it must be sure and strong hand for if once 
he feel the touch of such a stratagem 
it be not the choice brace of all our band 
can manacle or quench his fiery hand 

when they have seize he the ambush shall make in 

do as you please his blameless spirit deserve 
I dare engage my life of all this nothing 

why shall all this stir be then 

who know not 
the bombast polity thrust into his giant 
to make his wisdom seem of size as huge 
and all for sleight encounter of a shade 
so he be touch he will have heinous make 

it may be once so but so ever never 
ambition be abroad on foot on horse 
faction choke every corner street the court 
who faction it be you know and who be hold 
the fautor right hand how high his aim reach 
nought but a crown can measure this must fall 
past shadow weight and be most capital 

no question for since he be come to Cambray 
the malcontent decay Marquesse Renel 
be come and new arrive and make partaker 
of all the entertain show and feast 
that welcome Clermont to the brave virago 
his manly sister such we be esteem 
as be our comfort Marquesse malcontent 
come where he know his vain have safe vent 

let he come at his will and go as free 
let we ply Clermont our whole charge be he 

This for your lordship welcome into Cambray 

noble of lady it be beyond all power 
be my estate at first full in my mean 
to quit or merit 

you come something latter 
from court my lord than I and since news there 
be every day increase with the affair 
must I not ask now what the news be there 
where the court lie what stir change what advice 
from England Italy 

you must do so 
if you will be call a gentleman well qualify 
and wear your time and wit in those discourse 

the locrian prince therefore be brave rubers 
for whosoever there come new from country 
and in the city ask what news be punish 
since common such brain be most delight 
with innovation gossip tale and mischief 
but as of lion it be say and eagle 
that when they go they draw their seeres and talon 
close up to shun rebate of their sharpness 
so our wit sharpness which we shall employ 
in noble knowledge we shall never waste 
in vile and vulgar admiration 

it be right but who save only you perform it 
and your great brother madam where be he 

go a day since into the country confine 
to see their strength and readiness for service 

it be well he favour with the king have make he 
most worthy great and live right royal 

i will he will not do so honour never 
shall be esteem with wise man as the price 
and value of their virtuous service 
but as their sign or badge for that betray 
more glory in the outward grace of goodness 
then in the good itself and then it be say 
who more joy take that man his good advance 
then in the good itself do it by chance 

my brother speak all principle what man 
be move with your soul or have such a thought 
in any rate of goodness 

it be their fault 
we have example of it clear and many 
Demetrius Phalerius a orator 
and which not oft meet a philosopher 
so great in Athens grow that he erect 
three hundred statue of he of all which 
no rust nor length of time corrupt one 
but in his life time all be overthrow 
and Demades that past Demosthenes 
for all extemporal oration 
erect many statue which he live 
be break and melt into chamberpot 
many such end have fall on such proud honour 
no more because the man on who they fall 
grow insolent and leave their virtue state 
then for their hugeness that procure their hate 
and therefore little pomp in man most great 
make mighty and strong to the guard 
of what they win by chance or just reward 
great and immodest bravery again 
like statue much too high make for their base 
be overturn as soon as give their place 

here be a letter sir deliver i 
now at the foregate by a gentleman 

what gentleman 

he will not tell his name 
he say he have not time enough to tell it 
and say the little rest he have to say 

that be a merry say he take measure 
of his dear time like a most thrifty husband 

what news 

strange one and fit for a novation 
weighty unheard of mischievous enough 

heaven shield what be they 

read they good my lord

how be that 

Read on 

Maillard you brother lieutenant that yesterday invite you to see his muster have letter and strict charge from the king to apprehend you

nought that be 
approve by reason can be cowardice 

dispute when you shall fight wrong wreaklesse 
make man die honourless one bear another sleep 
leap on our shoulder 

we must wreak our wrong 
so as we take not more 

one wreak in time 
prevent all other then shine virtue most 
when time be find for fact and find not lose 

no time occur to king much less to virtue 
not can we call it virtue that proceed 
from vicious fury I repent that ever 
by any instigation in the appearance 
my brother spirit make as I imagine 
that ever I yield to revenge his murder 
all worthy man shall ever bring their blood 
to bear all ill not to be wreak with good 
do ill for no ill never private cause 
shall take on it the part of public law 

a D'Ambois bear in wrong so tame a spirit 

madam be sure there will be time enough 
for all the vengeance your great spirit can wish 
the course yet take be allow by all 
which be noble and refuse by the earl

outlaw in Arden dare have tempt thus 
one of our blood and name be it true or false

I suppose the worst 
which far I be from think and despise 
the army now in battle that shall act it 

I will not let my blood up to that thought 
but it shall cost the dear blood in France 

sweet sister osculatur far be both off as the fact 
of my feign apprehension 

I will once 
strip off my shame with my attire and try 
if a poor woman votist of revenge 
will not perform it with a precedent

to make you complete footman in who form 
you must be complete soldier you two only

I see then our guerdon 
must be the deed itself it will be such honour 

what fight soldier most for 

honour only 

yet here be crown beside 

we thank you captain 

now sir how show we 

as you shall at all part 
go now to Clermont D'Ambois and inform he 
two battle be set ready in his honour 
and stay his presence only for their signal 
when they shall join and that to attend he hither 
like one we so much honour we have send he 

we two in person 

well sir say it so 
and have bring he to the field when I 
fall in with he salute get you both 
of one side of his horse and pluck he down 
and I with the ambush lay will second you 

nay we shall lay on hand of too much strength 
to need your second 

I hope we shall 
two be enough to encounter Hercules 

it be well say worthy soldier haste and have he 

my scotch horse to their army 

please you sir 

sdeath you be pass diligent 

of my soul 
it be only in my love to honour you 
with what will grace the king but since I see 
you still sustain a jealous eye on i 
I will go before 

it be well I will come my hand 

your hand sir Come your word your choice be use 

I have a aversation to this voyage 
when first my brother move it and have find 
that native power in i be never vain 
yet now neglect it I wonder much 
at my inconstancy in these decree 
I every hour set down to guide my life 
when Homer make Achilles passionate 
wrathful revengeful and insatiate 
in his affection what man will deny 
he do compose it all of industry 
to let man see that man of most renown 
strong noble fair if they set not down 
decree within they for dispose these 
of judgement resolution uprightness 
and certain knowledge of their use and end 
mishap and misery no less extend 
to their destruction with all that they prise 
then to the poor and the most despise 

why how now friend retire take heed you prove not 
dismay with this strange fortune all observe you 
your government be as much mark as the king 
what say a friend to Pompey 

what 

the people 
will never know unless in death thou try 
that thou know how to bear adversity 

I shall approve how vile I value fear 
of death at all time but to be too rash 
without both will and care to shun the worst 
it be in power to do well and with cheer 
be stupid negligence and worse than fear 

suppose this true now 

no I can do it 
my sister true say there hang a tail 
of circumstance so black on that supposure 
that to sustain it thus abhor our mettle 
and I can shun it too in spite of all 
not go to field and there to be so mount 
as I will since I go 

you will then go 

I be engage both in my word and hand 
but this be it that make i thus retire 
to call myself to account how this affair 
be to be manage if the worst shall chance 
with which I note how dangerous it be 
for any man to press beyond the place 
to which his birth or mean or knowledge tie he 
for my part though of noble birth my birthright 
have little leave it and I know it be better 
to live with little and to keep within 
a man own strength still and in man true end 
then run a mix course good and bad hold never 
any thing common you can never find 
thing outward care but you neglect your mind 
God have the whole world perfect make and free 
his part to the use of they all man then that be 
part of that all must as the general sway 
of that import willing obey 
in every thing without their power to change 
he that unpleased to hold his place will range 
can in no other be contain that be fit 
and so resist they all be crush with it 
but he that know how divine a frame 
the whole world be and of it all can name 
without selfflattery no part so divine 
as he himself and therefore will confine 
free his whole power in his proper part 
go on most godlike he that strive to invert 
the universal course with his poor way 
not only dustlike shiver with the sway 
but cross God in his great work all earth 
bear not so curse and so damn a birth 

go on I will take no care what come of you 
heaven will not see it ill however it show 
but the pretext to see these battle range 
be much your honour 

as the world esteem it 
but to decide that you make i remember 
a accident of high and noble note 
and fit the subject of my late discourse 
of hold on our free and proper way 
I overtake come from Italy 
in Germany a great and famous earl 
of England the most goodly fashion man 
I ever see from head to foot in form 
rare and most absolute he have a face 
like one of the most ancient honour roman 
from whence his noble family be derive 
he be beside of spirit pass great 
valiant and learn and liberal as the sun 
speak and write sweet or of learned subject 
or of the discipline of public weal 
and it be the earl of Oxford and be offer 
at that time by duke Cassimere the view 
of his right royal army then in field 
refuse it and no foot be move to stir 
out of his own free foredetermine course 
I wonder at it ask for it his reason 
it be a offer so much for his honour 
he all acknowledge say it be not fit 
to take those honour that one can quit 

it be answer like the man you have describe 

and yet he cast it only in the way 
to stay and serve the world nor do it fit 
his own true estimate how much it weigh 
for he despise it and esteem it free 
to keep his own way straight and swear that he 
have rather make away his whole estate 
in thing that cross the vulgar than he will 
be freeze up stiff like a sir john Smith 
his countryman in common noble fashion 
affect as the end of noblesse be 
those servile observation 

it be strange 

o it be a vex sight to see a man 
out of his way stalk proud as he be in 
out of his way to be officious 
observant wary serious and grave 
fearful and passionate insult rage 
labour with iron flail to thresh down feather 
flit in air 

what one consider this 
of all that be thus out or once endeavour 
err to enter on man righthand path 

these be too grave for brave wit give they toy 
labour bestow on these be harsh and thriftless 
if you will consul be say one of Rome 
you must be watch start out of sleep 
every way whisk glorify plebeian 
kiss patrician hand rot at their door 
speak and do base every day bestow 
gift and observance upon one or other 
and what be the event of all twelve rod before thou 
three or four time sit for the whole tribunal 
exhibit circean game make public feast 
and for these idle outward thing say he 
will thou lay on such cost toil spend thy spirit 
and to be void of perturbation 
for constancy sleep when thou will have sleep 
wake when thou will wake fear nought vex for nought 
no pain will thou bestow no cost no thought 

what shall I say as good consort with you 
as with a angel I can hear you ever 

well in my lord and spend time with my sister 
and keep she from the field with all endeavour 
the soldier love she so and she so mad 
will take my apprehension if it chance 
that blood will flow in river 

heaven forbid 
and all with honour your arrival speed

in my acceptance since I joy in neither 
but go with sway of all the world together 
in all success fortune and the day 
to i alike be I be fix be she 
never so fickle and will there repose 
far past the reach of any die she throw 

villain not hold he when you have he down 

who can hold lightning 'sdeath a man as well 
may catch a canon bullet in his mouth 
and spit it in your hand as take and hold he 

pursue enclose he stand or fall on he 
and you may take he 'sdeath they make he guard

we come to entertain he sir for honour 

do you not say so 

slave he be a traitor 
command the horse troop to overrun the traitor 

what spirit breathe thus in this more than man 
turn flesh to air possess and in a storm 
tear man about the field like autumn leave 
he turn wild lightning in the lackey hand 
who though their sudden violent twitch unhorse he 
yet when he bear himself their saucy finger 
fly as too hot off as he have be fire 
the ambush then make in through all who force 
he drive as if a fierce and fire give canon 
have spit his iron vomit out among they 
the battle then in two halfmoon enclose he 
in which he show as if he be the light 
and they but earth who wonder what he be 
shrink their steel horn and give he glorious pass 
and as a great shot from a town besiege 
at foe before it fly forth black and roar 
but they too far and that with weight oppress 
as if disdain earth do only grass 
strike earth and up again into the air 
again sink to it and again do rise 
and keep such strength that when it soft move 
it piecemeal shiver any let it prove 
so fly brave Clermont forth till breath forsake he 
then fall to earth and yet sweet man even than 
his spirit convulsion make he bind again 
past all their reach till all motion spend 
his fix eye cast a blaze of such disdain 
all stand and stare and untouched let he lie 
as something sacred fall out of the sky 
o now some rude hand have lay hold on he 
see prisoner lead with his band honour more 
than all the freedom he enjoy before 

at length we have you sir 

you have much joy too 
I make you sport yet but I pray you tell i 
be not you perjure 

no I swear for the king 

yet perjury I hope be perjury 

but thus forswear be not perjury 
you be no politician not a fault 
how foul soever do for private end 
be fault in we swear to the public good 
we never can be of the damn crew 
we may impolitic ourselves as it be 
into the kingdom body politic 
whereof indeed we be member you miss term 

the thing be yet the same 

it be nothing so the property be alter 
you be no lawyer or say that oath and oath 
be still the same in number yet their species 
differ extreme as for flat example 
when politic widow try man for their turn 
before they wed they they be harlot then 
but when they wed they they be honest woman 
so private man when they forswear betray 
be perjure treacher but be public once 
that be swornmarried to the public good 

be marry woman public 

public good 
for marriage make they be the public good 
and can not be without they so I say 
man public that be be swornmarried 
to the good public be one body make 
with the realm body politic be no more 
private nor can be perjure though forswear 
more than a widow marry for the act 
of generation be for that a harlot 
because for that she be so be unmarried 
a argument a paribus 

it be a shrewd one 

who have no faith to man to God have none 
retain you that sir who say so 

it be I 

thy own tongue damn thy infidelity 
but captain all you know i noble bear 
use you to assault such man as I with lackey 

they be no lackey sir but soldier 
disguise in lackey coat 

sir we have see the enemy 

avaunt you rascal hence 

now leave your coat 

let i not see they more 

I grieve that virtue live so undistinguished 
from vice in any ill and though the crown 
of sovereign law she shall be yet her footstool 
subject to censure all the shame and pain 
of all her rigor 

yet false policy 
will cover all be like offender hide 
that after notice take where they hide 
the more they crouch and stir the more be spy 

I wonder how this chance you 

some informer 
blood hound to mischief usher to the hangman 
thirsty of honour for some huge state act 
perceive i great with the worthy Guise 
and he I know not why hold dangerous 
make i the desperate organ of his danger 
only with that poor colour it be the common 
and more than whorelike trick of treachery 
and vermin breed to rapine and to ruin 
for which this fault be still to be accuse 
since good act fail craft and deceit be use 
if it be other never pity i 

sir we be glad believe it and have hope 
the king will so conceit it 

at his pleasure 
in mean time what be your will lord lieutenant 

to leave your own horse and to mount the trumpet 

it shall be do this heavy prevent 
my purpose recreation in these part 
which now I think on let i beg you sir 
to lend i some one captain of your troop 
to bear the message of my hapless service 
and misery to my most noble mistress 
countess of Cambray to who house this night 
I promise my repair and know most true 
with all the ceremony of her favour 
she sure expect i 

think you now on that 

on that sir ay and that so worthy 
that if the king in spite of your great service 
will send i instant promise of enlargement 
condition I will set this message by 
I will not take it but have rather die 

your message shall be do sir I myself 
will be for you a messenger of ill 

I thank you sir and doubt not yet to live 
to quite your kindness 

mean space use your spirit 
and knowledge for the cheerful patience 
of this so strange and sudden consequence 

good sir believe that no particular torture 
can force i from my glad obedience 
to any thing the high and general cause 
to match with his whole fabric have ordain 
and know you all though far from all your aim 
yet worth they all and all man endless study 
that in this one thing all the discipline 
of manner and of manhood be contain 
a man to join himself with the vniverse 
in his main sway and make in all thing fit 
one with that all and go on round as it 
not pluck from the whole his wretched part 
and into straits or into nought revert 
wish the complete universe may be 
subject to such a rag of it as he 
but to consider great necessity 
all thing as well refract as voluntary 
reduce to the prime celestial cause 
which he that yield to with a man applause 
and cheek by cheek go cross it no breath 
but like God image follow to the death 
that man be true wise and every thing 
each cause and every part distinguish 
in nature with enough art understand 
and that full glory merit at all hand 
that do the whole world at all part adorn 
and appertain to one celestial bear 

so foul a scandal never man sustain 
which cause by the king be rude and tyrannous 
give i a place and my lieutenant make 
the filler of it 

I shall never look 
for better of he never trust a man 
for any justice that be rapt with pleasure 
to order arm well that make smock his ensign 
and his whole government sail you hear of late 
he have the four and twenty way of venery 
do all before he 

it be abhor and beastly 

it be more than nature mighty hand can do 
to make one humane and a lecher too 
look how a wolf do like a dog appear 
so like a friend be a adulterer 
voluptuary and these bellygod 
no more true man be then so many toad 
a good man happy be a common good 
vile man advance live of the common blood 

give and then take like child 

bounty be 
as soon repent as they happen rare 

what shall king do and man of eminent place 
but as they gather sow gift to the grace 
and where they have give rather give again 
be give for virtue then like babe and fool 
take and repent gift why be wealth and power 

power and wealth move to tyranny not bounty 
the merchant for his wealth be swell in mind 
when yet the chief lord of it be the wind 

that may so chance to our statemerchant too 
something perform that have not far to go 

that be the main point my lord insist on that 

but do this fire rage further have it take 
the tender tinder of my wife sere blood 
be she so passionate 

so wild so mad 
she can live and this unwreaked sustain 
the woe be bloody that in woman reign 
the Sicily gulf keep fear in less degree 
there be no tiger not more tame than she 

there be no look home then 

home Medea 
with all her herb charm thunder lightning 
make not her presence and black haunt more dreadful 

Come to the king if he reform not all 
mark the event none stand where that must fall

be that bereave he 

you will again prevent i

come all my misery I will hold though I burst 

then madam thus it fare he be invite 
by way of honour to he to take view 
of all the power his brother Baligny 
have in his government which range in battle 
Maillard lieutenant to the governor 
have receive strict letter from the king 
to train he to the muster and betray he 
to their surprise which with Chalon in chief 
and other captain all the field put hard

what change be here how be my hope prevent 
o my most faithful servant thou betray

full in all right in nought superfluous 
nor nothing strain past right for their right 
reign just and reign safe policy 
be but a guard corrupt and a way 
venture in desert without guide or path 
king punish subject error with their own 
king be like archer and their subject shaft 
for as when archer let their arrow fly 
they call to they and bid they fly or fall 
as if it be in the free power of the shaft 
to fly or fall when only it be the strength 
straight shoot compass give it by the archer 
that make it hit or miss and do either 
he be to be praise or blame and not the shaft 
so king to subject cry do do not this 
must to they by their own example strength 
the straightness of their act and equal compass 
give subject power to obey they in the like 
not shoot they forth with faulty aim and strength 
and lay the fault in they for fly amiss 

but for your servant I dare swear he guiltless

but ten such more they shall not all retain he 
but I will never die before I give 
Maillard a hundred slash with a sword 
Chalon a hundred breach with a pistol 
they can not all have take Clermont D'Ambois 
without their treachery he have buy his band out 
with their slave blood but he be credulous 
he will believe since he will be believe 
your noble nature be most credulous 
who give no trust all trust be apt to break 
hate like hell mouth who think not what they speak

on he again will it please you to return 
no service to he by i

of hearty sorrow as a tree fruit bear 
So do a undissembled sorrow tear 

this may have be before and save much charge 

now sir I hope you be much abuse eye see 
in my word for my Clermont what a villain 
he be that whisper in your jealous ear 
his own black treason in suggest Clermont 
colour with nothing but be great with i 
sign then this writ for his delivery 
your hand be never urge with worthy boldness 
come pray sir sign it why shall king be pray 
to act of justice it be a reverence 
make they despise and show they stick and tire 
in what their free power shall be hot as fire 

well take your will sir I will have i ere long 
but wherein be this Clermont such a rare one 

in his most gentle and unwearied mind 
right to virtue frame in very nature 
in his most firm inexorable spirit 
to be remove from any thing he choose 
for worthiness or bear the least persuasion 
to what be base or fit not his object 
in his contempt of riches and of greatness 
in estimation of the idolatrous vulgar 
his scorn of all thing servile and ignoble 
though they can gain he never such advancement 
his liberal kind of speak what be truth 
in spite of temporize the great rise 
and learning of his soul so much the more 
against ill fortune as she set herself 
sharp against he or will present most hard 
to shun the malice of her deadly charge 
his detestation of his special friend 
when he perceive their tyrannous will to do 
or their abjection base to sustain 
any injustice that they can revenge 
the flexibility of his most anger 
even in the main career and fury of it 
when any object of desertful pity 
offer itself to he his sweet disposure 
as much abhor to behold as do 
any unnatural and bloody action 
his just contempt of jester parasite 
servile observer and pollute tongue 
in short this seneschal man be find in he 
he may with heaven immortal power compare 
to who the day and fortune equal be 
come fair or foul whatever chance can fall 
fix in himself he still be one to all 

show he to other thus 

to all that know he 

and apprehend I this man for a traitor 

these be your machevilian villain 
your bastard Teucer that their mischief do 
run to your shield for shelter caucus 
that cut their too large murderous thievery 
to their den length still woe be to that state 
where treachery guard and ruin make man great 

go take my letter for he and release he 

thank to your highness ever live your highness 

better a man be bury quick then live 
a property for state and spoil to thrive 

we joy you take a chance so ill so well 

whoever see i differ in acceptance 
of either fortune 

what love bad like good 
how shall one learn that 

to love nothing outward 
or not within our own power to command 
and so be sure of every thing we love 
who care to lose the rest if any man 
will neither live nor die in his free choice 
but as he see necessity will have it 
which if he will resist he strive in vain 
what can come near he that he do not well 
and if in worst event his will be do 
how can the best be better all be one 

methinks it be pretty 

put no difference 
if you have this or not this but as child 
play at quoit ever regard their game 
and care not for their quoit so let a man 
the thing themselves that touch he not esteem 
but his free power in well dispose they 

pretty from toy 

methinks this double distich 
seem pretty too to stay superfluous long 
not to have want what riches do exceed 
not to be subject what superior thing 
he that to nought aspire do nothing need 
who break no law be subject to no king 

This go to my ear well I promise you 

o but it be pass hard to stay one thus 

it be so rank custom rap man so beyond it 
and as it be hard so well man door to bar 
to keep the cat out and the adulterer 
so it be as hard to curb affection so 
we let in nought to make they overflow 
and as of Homer verse many critic 
on those stand of which time old moth have eat 
the first or last foot and the perfect part 
of his unmatched poem sink beneath 
with upright gasp and sloth dull as death 
so the unprofitable thing of life 
and those we can compass we affect 
all that do profit and we have neglect 
like covetous and base get man 
that gather much use never what they keep 
but for the least they lose extreme weep 

this pretty talk and our horse walk 
down this steep hill spend time with equal profit 

it be well bestow on you meat and man sick 
agree like this and you and yet even this 
be the end of all skill power wealth all that be 

I long to hear sir how your mistress take this 

we soon shall know it see Aumerle return 

ease to your band sir 

welcome worthy friend 

How take his noble mistress your sad message

nor a more ruthful sorrow I well wish 
some other have be master of my message

of your unhappy apprehension 

this be to i compare with her much moan 
as one tear be to her whole passion 

sir she commend her kind service to you 
and this rich cabinet 

o happy man 
this may enough hold to redeem your band 

these cloud I doubt not will be soon blow over 

your hope be just and happy see sir both 
in both the look of these 

here be a discharge 
for this your prisoner my good lord lieutenant 

Alas sir I usurp that style enforce 
and hope you know it be not my aspire 

well sir my wrong aspire past all man hope 

I sorrow for it sir

brother I bring you down too much good purpose 

repeat not that sir the amends make all 

I joy in it my best and worthy friend 
oh you have a princely fautor of the Guise 

I think I do my part to 

well sir all 
be in the issue well and worthy friend 
here be from your friend the Guise here from the countess 
your brother mistress the content whereof 
I know and must prepare you now to please 
the unrested spirit of your slaughter brother 
if it be true as you imagine once 
his apparition show it the complot 
be now lay sure betwixt we therefore haste 
both to your great friend who have some use weighty 
for your repair to he and to the countess 
who satisfaction be no less important 

I see all and will haste as it import 
and good friend since I must delay a little 
my wish attendance on my noble mistress 
excuse i to she with return of this 
and endless protestation of my service 
and now become as glad a messenger 
as you be late a woeful 

happy change 
I ever will salute thou with my service 

yet more news brother the late jest monsieur 
make now your brother die prophecy equal 
at all part be dead as he presage 

heaven shield the Guise from second that truth 
with what he likewise prophesy on he 

it have enough it be grace with truth in one 
to the other falsehood and confusion 
lead to the court sir 

you I will lead no more 
it be to ominous and foul before 

up from the chaos of eternal night 
to which the whole digestion of the world 
be now return once more I ascend 
and bide the cold damp of this pierce air 
to urge the justice who almighty word 
measure the bloody act of impious man 
with equal penance who in the act itself 
include the infliction which like chain shot 
batter together still though as the thunder 
seem by man dull hear than their sight 
to break a great time after lightning forth 
yet both at one time tear the labour cloud 
so man think penance of their ill be slow 
though the ill and penance still together go 
reform you ignorant man your manless life 
who law you think be nothing but your lust 
when leave but for supposition sake 
the body of felicity religion 
set in the midst of Christendom and her head 
cleave to her bosom one half one way sway 
another the other all the christian world 
and all her law who observation 
stand upon faith above the power of reason 
leave I say all these this may suffice 
to fray you from your vicious swinge in ill 
and set you more on fire to do more good 
that since the world as which of you deny 
stand by proportion all may thence conclude 
that all the joint and nerve sustain nature 
as well may break and yet the world abide 
as any one good unrewarded die 
or any one ill escape his penalty 

thus friend thou see how all good man will thrive 
do not the good thou prompt i with prevent 
the jealous ill pursue they in other 
but now thy danger be dispatch note i 
have thou not hear of that admire voice 
that at the barricado speak to i 
no person see let we lead my lord to Rheims 

nor can you learn the person 

by no mean 

it be but your fancy then a wake dream 
for as in sleep which bind both the outward sense 
and the sense common to the imagine power 
stir up by form hide in the memory store 
or by the vapour of overflow humour 
in body full and foul and mix with spirit 
faines many strange miraculous image 
in which act it so painful apply 
itself to those form that the common sense 
it actuate with his motion and thereby 
those fiction true seem and have real act 
so in the strength of our conceit awake 
the cause alike do of like fiction make 

be what it will it be a presage of something 
weighty and secret which the advertisement 
I have receive from all part both without 
and in this kingdom as from Rome and Spain 
Soccaine and Savoy give i cause to think 
all writing that our plot catastrophe 
for propagation of the Catholic cause 
will bloody prove dissolve all our counsel 

retire then from they all 

I must not do so 
the archbishop of Lyons tell i plain 
I shall be say then to abandon France 
in so important a occasion 
and that my enemy their profit make 
of my faint absence soon will let that fall 
that all my pain do to this height exhale 

let all fall that will rise unlawful 
make not your forward spirit in virtue right 
a property for vice by thrust on 
further than all your power can fetch you off 
it be enough your will be infinite 
to all thing virtuous and religious 
which within limit keep may without danger 
let virtue some good from your grace gather 
avarice of all be ever nothing father 

danger the spur of all great mind be ever 
the curb to your tame spirit you respect not 
with all your holiness of life and learning 
more than the present like illiterate vulgar 
your mind you say keep in your flesh bound 
show that man will must rule be by his power 
when by true doctrine you be teach to live 
rather without the body then within 
and rather to your god still then yourself 
to live to he be to do all thing fit 
his image in which like himself we live 
to be his image be to do those thing 
that make we deathless which by death be only 
do those deed that fit eternity 
and those deed be the perfect that justice 
that make the world last which proportion be 
of punishment and wreak for every wrong 
as well as for right a reward as strong 
away then use the mean thou have to right 
the wrong I suffer what corrupt law 
leave unperformed in king do thou supply 
and be above they all in dignity 

why stand thou still thus and apply thy ear 
and eye to nothing 

see you nothing here 

thou dream awake now what be here to see 

my brother spirit urge his revenge 

thy brother spirit pray thou mock i not 

no by my love and service 

will he rise 
and not be thunder threat against the Guise 

you make amends for enmity to he 
with ten part more love and desert of i 
and as you make your hate to he no let 
of any love to i no more bear he 
since you to i supply it hate to you 
which reason and which justice be perform 
in spirit ten part more than fleshy man 
to who foresight our act and thought lie open 
and therefore since he see the treachery 
late practise by my brother Baligny 
he will not honour his hand with the justice 
as he esteem it of his blood revenge 
to which my sister needs will have he swear 
before she will consent to marry he 

o Baligny who will believe there be 
a man that only since his look be raise 
upward and have but sacred heaven in sight 
can bear a mind so more than devilish 
as for the paint glory of the countenance 
flit in king do good for nought esteem 
and the more ill he do the better seem 

we easy may believe it since we see 
in this world practice few man better be 
justice to live do nought but justice need 
but policy must still on mischief feed 
untruth for all his end truth name do sue in 
none safe live but those that study ruin 
a good man happy be a common good 
ill man advance live of the common blood 

but this thy brother spirit startle i 
these spirit seld or never haunt man 
but some mishap ensue 

ensue what can 
tyrant may kill but never hurt a man 
all to his good make spite of death and hell 

all the desert of good renown your highness 

Welcome Aumerle 

my good friend friendly welcome 
How take my noble mistress the change news 

it come too late sir for those lovely eye 
through which a soul look so divine love 
tear nothing utter she distress enough 
she weep quite out and like two fall star 
their dear sight quite vanish with her tear 

all good forbid it 

what event be these 

all must be bear my lord and yet this chance 
will willing enforce a man to cast off 
all power to bear with comfort since he see 
in this our comfort make our misery 

how strange thou be love of both the sex 
yet thou love neither but the good of both 

in love of woman my affection first 
take fire out of the frail part of my blood 
which till I have enjoy be passionate 
like other lover but fruition past 
I then love out of judgement the desert 
of she I love still stick in my heart 
though the desire and the delight be go 
which must chance still since the comparison 
make upon trial betwixt what reason love 
and what affection make in i the best 
ever prefer what most love value lest 

thy love be judgement then and of the mind 
marry thy worthy mistress now be blind 

if there be love in marriage so I will 
but I deny that any man do love 
affect wife maid widow any woman 
for neither Fly love milk although they drown 
in greedy search thereof nor do the bee 
love honey though the labour of her life 
be spend in gather it nor those that fat 
or beast or fowl do any thing therein 
for any love for as when only nature 
move man to meat as far as her power rule 
she do it with a temperate appetite 
the too much man devour abhor nature 
and in our most health be our most disease 
so when humanity rule man and woman 
it be for society confine in reason 
but what excite the bed desire in blood 
by no mean just can be construe love 
for when love kindle any know spirit 
it end in virtue and effect divine 
and be in friendship chaste and masculine 

thou shall my mistress be methinks my blood 
be take up to all love with thy virtue 
and howsoever other man despise 
these paradox strange and too precise 
since they hold on the right way of our reason 
I can attend they ever Come away 
perform thy brother thus importune wreak 
and I will see what great affair the king 
have to employ my counsel which he seem 
much to desire and more and more esteem 

see you his saucy force of my hand 
to D'Ambois freedom 

see and through my eye 
let fire into my heart that burn to bear 
a insolence so giantly austere 

the more king bear at subject hand the more 
their linger justice gather that resemble 
the weighty and the goodlybodied eagle 
who be on earth before her shady wing 
can raise she into air a mighty way 
close by the ground she run but be aloft 
all she command she fly at and the more 
death in her seres bear the more time she stay 
her thundery stoop from that on which she prey 

you must be then more secret in the weight 
of these your shady counsel who will else 
bear where such spark fly as the Guise and D'Ambois 
powder about they counsel as your entrails 
shall be unpierced and sound keep for not those 
who you discover you neglect but open 
a ruinous passage to your own best hope 

we have spy set on we as we on other 
and therefore they that serve we must excuse we 
if what we most hold in our heart take wind 
deceit have eye that see into the mind 
but this plot shall be quick than their twinkle 
on who lid fate with her dead weight shall lie 
and confidence that lighten ere she die 
friend of my guard as you give oath to be 
true to your sovereign keep it manful 
your eye have witness oft the ambition 
that never make access to i in Guise 
but treason ever sparkle in his eye 
which if you free we of our safety shall 
you not our subject but our patron call 

our duty bind we he be now but dead 

we trust in it and thank you Baligny 
go lodge their ambush and thou God that be 
fautor of prince thunder from the sky 
beneath his hill of pride this giant Guise 

I see you be servant sir to my dear sister 
the lady of her love Baligny 

madam I be bind to her virtuous bounty 
for that life which I offer in her virtuous service 
to the revenge of her renown brother 

she write to i as much and much desire 
that you may be the man who spirit she know 
will cut short off these long and dull delay 
hitherto to bribe the eternal justice 
which I believe since her unmatched spirit 
can judge of spirit that have her sulphur in they 
but I must tell you that I make no doubt 
her live brother will revenge her dead 
on who the dead impose the task and he 
I know will come to effect it instant 

they be but word in he believe they not 

see this be the vault where he must enter 
where now I think he be 

God save you lady 
what gentleman be this with who you trust 
the deadly weighty secret of this hour 

one that yourself will say I well may trust 

then come up madam 
see here honour lady 
a countess that in love mishap do equal 
at all part your wrong self and be the mistress 
of your slay servant brother in who love 
for his late treacherous apprehension 
she weep her fair eye from her ivory brow 
and will have weep her soul out have not I 
promise to bring she to this mortal quarry 
that by her lose eye for her servant love 
she may conjure he from this stern attempt 
in which by a most ominous dream she have 
she know his death fix and that never more 
out of this place the sun shall see he live 

I be provide then to take his place 
and undertake on i 

you sir why 

since I be charge so by my mistress 
his mournful sister 

see she letter sir 
good madam I rue your fate more than i 
and know not how to order these affair 
they stand on such occurrent 

This indeed 
I know to be your lady mistress hand 
and know beside his brother will and must 
endure no hand in this revenge but his 

away dispute no more get up and see 
Clermont must author this just tragedy 

who be that 

the spirit of Bussy 

o my servant let we embrace 

forbear the air in which 
my figure likeness be impress will blast 
let my revenge for all love satisfy 
in which dame fear not Clermont shall not die 
no word dispute more up and see the event 
make the guard sure Renel and then the door 
command to make fast when the earl be in 
the black softfooted hour be now on wing 
which for my just wreak ghost shall celebrate 
with dance dire and of infernal state 

who say that death be natural when nature 
be with the only thought of it dismay 
I have have lottery set up for my death 
and I have draw beneath my trencher one 
knit in my handkerchief another lot 
the word be you be a dead man if you enter 
and these word this imperfect blood and flesh 
shrink at in spite of i their solid part 
melt like snow within i with cold fire 
I hate myself that seek to rule king 
I can curb my slave will any spirit 
free manly princely wish to live to be 
command by this mass of slavery 
since reason judgement resolution 
and scorn of what we fear will yield to fear 
while this same sink of sensuality swell 
who will live sink in it and not spring 
up to the star and leave this carrion here 
for wolf and vulture and for dog to tear 
o Clermont D'Ambois be thou here to chide 
this softness from my flesh far as my reason 
far as my resolution not to stir 
one foot out of the way for death and hell 
let my false man by falsehood perish here 
there be no way else to set my true man clear 

the king desire your grace to come to council 

I come it can be he will not dare 
to touch i with a treachery so profane 
will Clermont now be here to try how he 
will lay about he if this plot shall be 
here will be toss soul into the sky 
whoever know blood save by treachery 
well I must on and will what shall I fear 
not against two Alcides against two 
and Hercules to friend the Guise will go 

hold murderer 
so then this be confidence 
in greatness not in goodness where be the king 
let he appear to justify his deed 
in spite of my betray wound ere my soul 
take her flight through they and my tongue have strength 
to urge his tyranny 

see sir I be come 
to justify it before man and God 
who know with what wound in my heart for woe 
of your so wound faith I make these wound 
force to it by a insolence of force 
to stir a stone nor be a rock oppose 
to all the billow of the churlish sea 
more beat and eat with they then be I 
with your ambitious mad idolatry 
and this blood I shed be to save the blood 
of many thousand 

that be your white pretext 
but you will find one drop of blood shed lawless 
will be the fountain to a purple sea 
the present lust and shift make for king live 
against the pure form and just power of law 
will thrive like shifter purchase there hang 
a black star in the sky to which the sun 
give yet no light will rain a poison shower 
into your entrails that will make you feel 
how little safety lie in treacherous steel 

well sir I will bear it you have a brother to 
burst with like threat the scarlet cardinal 
seek and lay hand on he and take this hence 
their blood for all you on my conscience 

so sir your full swinge take i death have curb

of my love brother rest in endless peace

and to your ash be the earth no load 

how strange be this the Guise among these spirit 
and his great brother cardinal both yet live 
and that the rest with they with joy thus celebrate 
this our revenge This certain presage 
some instant death both to the Guise and cardinal 
that the chatillion ghost to shall thus join 
in celebration of this just revenge 
with Guise that bear a chief stroke in his death 
it seem that now he do approve the act 
and these true shadow of the Guise and cardinal 
forerunning thus their body may approve 
that all thing to be do as here we live 
be do before all time in the other life 
that spirit shall rise in these time yet be fable 
though learned man hold that our sensive spirit 
a little time abide about the grave 
of their decease body and can take 
in cold condense air the same form they have 
when they be shut up in this body shade 

o sir the Guise be slay 

avert it heaven 

send for to council by the king a ambush 
lodge for the purpose rush on he and take 
his princely life who send in die then 
his love to you as to the best of man 

the worst and most accurse of thing creep 
on earth sad bosom let i pray you all 
a little to forbear and let i use 
free my own mind in lament he 
I will call you straight again 

we will forbear and leave you free sir 

shall I live and he 
dead that alone give mean of life to i 
there be no dispute with the act of king 
revenge be impious on their sacred person 
and can I play the worldling no man love 
long than gain be reap or grace from he 
I shall survive and shall be wonder at 
though in my own hand be I end with he 
but friendship be the cement of two mind 
as of one man the soul and body be 
of which one can sever but the other 
suffer a needful separation 

I fear your servant madam let we descend 

since I can skill of man I never live 
to please man worldly and shall I in death 
respect their pleasure make such a jar 
betwixt my death and life when death shall make 
the consort sweet the end be proof and crown 
to all the skill and worth we true own 
Guise oh my lord how shall I cast from i 
the band and covert hinder i from thou 
the garment or the cover of the mind 
the humane soul be of the soul the spirit 
the proper robe be of the spirit the blood 
and of the blood the body be the shroud 
with that must I begin then to unclothe 
and come at the other now then as a ship 
touch at strange and far remove shore 
her man ashore go for their several end 
fresh water victual precious stone and pearl 
all yet intentive when the master call 
the ship to put off ready to leave all 
their greedy labour lest they there be leave 
to thief or beast or be the country slave 
so now my master call my ship my venture 
all in one bottom put all quite put off 
go under sail and I leave negligent 
to all the horror of the vicious time 
the far remove shore to all virtuous aim 
none favour goodness none but he respect 
piety or manhood shall I here survive 
not cast i after he into the sea 
rather than here live ready every hour 
to feed thief beast and be the slave of power 
I come my lord Clermont thy creature come 

what lie and languish Clermont curse man 
to leave he here thus he have slay himself 

misery on misery o i wretched dame 
of all that breath all heaven turn all his eye 
in hearty envy thus on one poor dame 

well do my brother I do love thou ever 
but now adore thou loss of such a friend 
none shall survive of such a brother 
with my false husband live and both these slay 
ere I return to he I will turn to earth 

horror of humane eye oh Clermont D'Ambois 
madam we stay too long your servant be slay 

it must be so he live but in the Guise 
as I in he o follow life my eye 

hide hide thy snaky head to cloister fly 
in penance pine too easy it be to die 

it be in cloister than let we all survive 
madam since wrath nor grief can help these fortune 
let we forsake the world in which they reign 
and for their wish amends to God complain 

it be fit and only needful lead i on 
in heaven course comfort seek in earth be none 

we come indeed too late which much I rue 
and will have keep this Clermont as my crown 
take in the dead and make this fatal room 
the house shut up the famous D'Ambois tomb
