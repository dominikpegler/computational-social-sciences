I grant he a impostor therein false 
but when your highness hear the circumstance 
I know your wisdom and meek piety 
will judge he well deserve in your eye

excuse conceal of his master death

of our sad torment and red suffering

lord of Burtholme some time admiral 

I be his only son who you set free 
therefore submissive I kneel and crave 
you will with patience hear your servant speak 

be brief my swell heart be at point to break 

I stand upon the top of the high scar 
where I behold the split ship let in 
devour ruin in the shape of wave 
some get on raft but be as soon cast off 
as they be seat many stride the mast 
but the sea work be so violent 
that nothing can preserve they from their fury 
they do and be entomb in the deep 
except some two the surge wash ashore 
prince Charles be one who on Lorrique back 
hang with clasp hand that never can unfold 

why not aswell as he Lorrique do live

seek sundry mean to spoil his newgained life 
exclaim for his master curse heaven 
for be unjust to you though not to he 
for rob you of comfort in your son 
o gracious lady say this grieve man

till Hoffman be as willing as myself 
do for his love to you that pity he

the rankness and the venom of the earth 
it seem frequentless for the use of man 
some basilisk or poisonous serpent den 

it be indeed a undelight full walk 
but if I do not err in my belief 
I think the ground the tree the rock the spring

in memory of his untimeless fall 
for hereabout hereabout the place

and stay this fellow from despair ill 

I be ordain unto perdition stay i not 
for when you know the mischief I have do 
at least consent to through coward fear 
you will not stop i if I skip in quick 
to that black bottomless and ruthless gulf 
where everlasting sorrow like link chain 
fetter the wretched in eternal night 

what have thou do 

knavery I warrant you tell truth and shame the 
devil my boy do and thou shall have a fine thing by and by 

I take your highness for that reverend duchess 
late wife unto the duke of Prussia

how you come childless you brotherless 
you husbandless and fatherless all all 
I will tell you have end act my fall 

well forward 

be it so I have deserve a great cruelty 
to be keep live when I long to die 

I charge thou set by all circumstance 
thou utter what thou know my heart be steel 
nor can it suffer more than it do feel 

then thus prince Charles and I escape the wrack 
come safe ashore to this accurse plot 
where we meet Hoffman who upon yond tree 
preserve his father bare anatomy 
the big of they two be those strong bone 
that act mighty deed 
Hoffman the son full of revenge and hate 
against every hand that wrought his father hurt 
yet guild over his envy with fair show 
and entertain we with as friendly term 
as falsehood can invent and it be well know 
bitter deceit use the sweet speech 
at length he take advantage bind my lord 
and in a chain tie he to yonder rock 
while with a burn crown he fear in twain 
the purple vein strong sinew artery nerve 
and every cartilege about the head 
in which sad torment the mild prince fall dead 

do Hoffman this and thou conceal the deed 

pardon my fear dread madam 

well go on I be confident to hear all cruelty 
and be resolve to act some if no hand 
will else attempt the murderer and but i 

be patient you will find associate 
for there be many murderer more behind 

what do he with the body of my son 

bury the flesh the bone be they that hang 
close by his father 

let they hang a while 
hope of revenge in wrath do make i smile 

pray let he tell the rest 

This act Hoffman force i to conceal 
the murder of my lord and threaten more 
than death by many torment till I swear 
to call he Otho and say he be your son 
I swear and keep my oath 

o heaven 

o devil 

nay I pray you peace 

then send he i for you and you he send 
or as I best remember lead you on 
unto the chapel porch where he himself 
appoint they to stay and there you know 
what happen in your wrath 

to i asleep 
and to my harmless Lodowick in my arm 

on on that deed be write among the act of guilt 
a brother sword a brother life blood spill 

proceed what be next kill he not Austria 

he do 

o villain do he kill my father 
and make my brother kill my husband too 

go forward 

after all those hate murder 
he teach the foolish prince in the disguise 
of a french doctor to prepare a poison 
which be the death of princely Ferdinand 
next plot he purpose your grace death 
and have oppose my strength of my tear 
you have be murder as you lay asleep 

let we hear no more seek out the hate wretch 
and with due torture let his life be force 
from his despise body 

do I pray 

all the land will help 
and each man be a justice in this act 

well I that never know revenge power 
have entertain she new in my breast 
determine what be to do 

Even what you will will I be with my Lodowick asleep 
in the elysian field where no fear dwell 
for earth appear as vile to i as hell 

let i be prologue to your scene of wrath 
and as the roman Catiline resolve 
his doubtful follower by exhaust blood 
from the live body so draw i cast i 
upon the trouble and offend earth 
offer blood fit for a infernal sacrifice 
wine be not pour but on celestial offering 
therefore I advise you 
as you hope to thrive in your revenge smite i 
that have be pander to this injury 

thou merit death indeed 

stay judge he not let i a little plead in his excuse 
and this one sentence serve he man compel 
to evil act can be just hold 
a wilful malefactor the law still 
look upon the deed never on the will 
beside although I grant the matter small 
and very safe to raise a multitude 
that by their power may cease the murderer 
yet two especial reason across that course 
first many have notice of our plot 
one babble tongue may utter out intent 
and Hoffman be warn be sure arm 
have the fort and treasure in his power 
and be his cause more than notorious ill 
he may with gold maintain it at his will 
escape we for no doubt he be full of sleight 
beside revenge shall have proportion 
by sly deceit he act every wrong 
and by deceit I will have he entrap 
then the revenge be fit just and square 
and it will more vex he that be all compose 
of craft and subtlety to be outstrip 
in his own fashion than a hundred death 
therefore by my advice pardon Lorrique 
upon condition that he lie some plot 
to intercept the other 

we be agree 

your mercy do all bound of hope exceed 
and if you will repose that trust in i 
by all the protestation truth can make 
before the sun have run his midday course 
I will tomorrow yield he to your hand 

show we the mean 

the mean be in the duchess policy 
if she can smooth the murder but a while 

I will turn deceit to overthrow his fraud 

then with fair word his flattery entertain 
and when he do importune you for love 
desire he first to show you the first place 
where he behold prince Charles after the wrack 
say you have earnest entreat i 
but I have lead you in a labyrinth 
of no effect he full of heat and lust
