a wife the happy state it can be 

yes such a wife as I that have a man 
as if myself have make he such a one 
as I may just say I be the rib 
belong to his breast widow and maid 
your life compare to i be miserable 
though wealth and beauty meet in each of you 
poor virgin all thy sport be think of love 
and meditation of a man the time 
and circumstance ere thou can fix thy thought 
on one thy fancy will approve 

that trouble already may be pass 

why if it be 
the doubt he will not hold his brittle faith 
that he be not a compatible choice 
and so your noble friend will cross the match 
do make your happiness uncertain still 
or say you marry he what he will prove 
can you compare your state then to a wife 

nay all the freedom that a virgin have 
be much to be prefer who will endure 
the humour of so insolent a thing 
as be a husband which of all the herd 
run not possess with some notorious vice 
drink or whore fight jealousy 
even of a page at twelve or of a groom 
that rub horseheel be it not daily see 
man take wife but to dress their meat to wash 
and starch their linen for the other matter 
of lie with they that be but when they please 
and whatsoever the joy be of the bed 
the pang that follow procreation 
be hideous or you wife have gull your husband 
with your loud shriek and your deathful throe 
a wife or widow to a virgin life 

why shall the best of you think you enjoy 
the rest and rule that a free widow do 
I be my own commander and the bliss 
of wooer and of each variety 
frequent i as I be a maid no brother 
have I to dice my patrimony away as you 
my maiden madam may no husband death 
stand I in doubt on for thanks be to heaven 
if mine be good the grievous loss of he 
be not to come if he be bad he be go 
and I no more embrace my injury 
but be you ill you nightly clasp your hate 
or good why he may die or change his virtue 
and thou though single haste a bedfellow 
as bad as the worst husband thought of one 
and what that be man with their wife do do 
and long expectance till the deed be do 
a wife be like a garment use and tear 
a maid like one make up but never wear 

a widow be a garment wear threadbare 
sell at second hand like broker ware 
but let we speak of thing the present time 
make happy to we and see what be best 
I have a servant than the crown of man 
the fountain of humanity the prize 
of every virtue moral and divine 
young valiant learned wellborn rich and shape

have mean to give he nothing but his form 
yet all addition be confer on he 
that may delight a woman this same youth 
to i have sacrifice his heart yet I 
have check his suit laugh at his worthy service 
make he the exercise of my cruelty 
while constant as the sun for all these cloud
