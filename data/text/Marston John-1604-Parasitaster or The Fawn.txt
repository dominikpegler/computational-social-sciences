how term you that lady with who she hold discourse 

o fawn it be a lady even above ambition and like the vertical sun that neither force other to cast shadow nor can other force or shade she her style be donna Philocalia 

Philocalia what that renown lady who ample report have strike wonder into remote stranger and yet her worth above that wonder she who noble industry have make her breast rich in true glory and undying hability she that while other lady spend the life of earth time in read their glass their jewel and the shame of poesy lustful sonnet give her soul meditation those meditation wing that cleave the air fan bright celestial fire who true reflection make she see herself and they she who pity be ever above her envy love nothing less than insolent prosperity and pity nothing more than virtue destitute of fortune 

there be a lady for Ferrara duke one of great blood firm age undoubted honour above her sex most modest artful though natural modest too excellent to be leave unmatched though few worthy to much with she 

I can tell my thought grow busy 

the prince will be private void the presence exeunt 

may I rest sure thou will conceal a secret 

yes Nadam 

how may I rest true assure 

true thus do not tell it i 

why can thou not conceal a secret 

yes as long as it be a secret but when tow know it how can it be a secret and indeed with what justice can you expect secrecy in i that can be private to yourself 

faith Philocalia I must of force trust thy silence for my breast break if I confer not my thought upon thou 

you may trust my silence I can command that but if I chance to he question I must speak truth I can conceal but not deny my knowledge that must command i 

fie on these philosophical discourse woman prithee confer with i like a creature make of flesh and blood and tell i if it be not a scandal to the soul of all be proportion that I a female of 15 of a lightsome and civil discretion healthy lusty vigorous full and idle shall for ever be shackle to the crampy shin of a wayward dull sour austere rough rheumy threescore and four 

nay threescore and ten at the least 

now heaven bless i as it be pity that every knave be not a fool so it be shame that every old man be not and rest not a widower they say in China when woman be pass childbearing they be all burn to make gunpowder I wonder what man shall be do withal when they be past childgetting yet upon my love Philocalia which with lady be often above their honour I do even dote upon the best part of the duke 

what be that 

his son yes soothe and so love he that I must marry he 

and wherefore love he so to marry he 

because I love he and because he his virtuous I love to marry 

his virtue 

ay with he his virtue 

I with he alas sweet prince love or virtue be not of the essence of marriage 

a jest upon your understanding I will maintain that wisdom in a woman be most foolish quality a lady of a good complexion natural well witted perfect breed and well exercise in discourse of the best man shall make fool of a thousand of these book think creature I speak it by way of justification I tell thou look that nobody eavesdrop we I tell thou I be true learn for I proteigrance and wise for I love myself and virtuous enough for a lady of fifteen 

how virtuous 

shall I speak like a creature of a good healthful blood and not like one of these weak green sickness leave tissick starveling first for the virtue of magnanimity I be very valiant for there be no heroic action so particular noble and glorious to our sex as not to fall to action the great deed we can do be not to do look that nobody listen then be I full of patience and can bear more than a sumpter horse for to speak sensible what burden be there so heavy to a porter back as virginity to a well complexioned young lady thought look nobody hearken by this hand the noble vow be that of virginity because the hard I will have the prince 

but by what mean sweet madam 

o Philocalia in heavy sadness and unwanton phrase there lie all the brain work by what mean I can fall into a miserable blank verse present 

but dear madam your reason of love he 

faith only a woman reason because I be express forbid to love he at the first view I like he and no soon have my father wisdom mistrust my like but I grow loath his judgement shall err I pity he shall prove a fool in his old age and without cause mistrust i 

but when you see no mean of manifest your affection to he why do not your hope perish 

o Philocalia that difficulty only inflame i when the enterprise be easy the victory be inglorious no let my wise age learned intelligent father that can interpret eye understand the language of bird interpret the grumble of dog and the conference of cat that can read even silence let he forbid all interview all speech all token all message all as he think human mean I will speak to the prince court the prince that he shall understand i nay I will so stalk on the blind side of my all know father wit that do what his wisdom can he shall be my only mediator my only messenger my only honourable spokesman he shall carry my favour he shall amplify my affection nay he shall direct the prince the mean the very way to my bed he and only he when he only can do this and only will not do this he only shall do this 

only you shall then deserve such a husband oh love how violent be thy passage 

pish Philocalia it be against the nature of love not to be violent 

and against the condition of violence to be constant 

constancy constancy and patience be virtue in no live creature but sentinel and angler here be our father 

what do he think to walk invisible before our eye and he have Gyges ring I will find he 

fore jove you rate he with emphasis 

do we not shake the prince with energy 

with ciceronian elocution 

and most pathetic pierce oratory 

if he have any wit in he he will make sweet use of it 

nay he shall make sweet use of it ere I have do lord what overween fool these young man be that think we old man sot 

arrant ass

silence be a excellent modest grace but especial before so instruct a wisdom as that of your excellency as for his advancement you give it most royal because he deserve it least due since to give to virtuous desert be rather a due requital than a princely magnificence when to undeservingness it be mere all bounty and free grace 

Well speak it be enough don Granuffo this Fawnus be a very worthy fellow and a excellent courtier and belove of most of the prince of Christendom I can tell you for howsoever some severe dissembler grace he not when he affront he in the full face yet if he come behind or on the one side he will leer and put back his head upon he be sure be you two precious to each other

it be enough you two I love hearty for thy silence never displease i nor thy speech ever offend i see our daughter attend we my fair my wise my chaste my duteous and indeed in all my daughter for such a pretty soul for all the world have I be what I think we have make the prince to feel his error what do he think he have weak fool in hand no he shall find as wise say Lucullus young man be fool that go about to gull we 

but sooth my wise father the young prince be yet forgetful and rest resolute in his much unadvised love 

be it possible 

nay I protest whatever he fain to you as he can feign most deep 

right we know it for if you mark he will not once take sense of any such intent from he oh impudence what mercy canst thou look for 

and as I say royal wise and wise royal father 

I think that eloquence be hereditary 

though he can feign yet I presume your sense be quick enough to find he 

quick be it not 

be it not fawn why I do know you feign nay I do know by the just sequence of such impudence that he have lay some second siege unto thy bosom with most miraculous conveyance of some rich present on thou 

o bounteous heaven how liberal be your grace to my nestorlike father 

be it not so say 

it be so oraculous father he have now more than court with bare phrase 
see father see the very bane of honour 
corruption of justice and virginity 
gift have he leave with i oh view this scarf 
this as he call it most envy silk 
that shall embrace a arm or waste or side 
which he much fear shall never this he leave 
despite my much resistance 

do he so give it i I will give it he I will regive his token with so sharp advantage 

nay my worthy father read but these cunning letter 

letter where prove you but just love and conceit i 
till justice leave the god I will never leave thou 
for though the duke seem wise he will find this strain 
where two heart yield consent all thwart be vain 
and dare thou then aver this wicked write 
oh world of wench wile where be thy wit 

but other talk for we be far more fit 
for see here come the prince Tiberio 

daughter upon thy obedience instant take thy chamber 

dear father in all duty let i beseech your leave that I may but 

go to go to you be a simple fool a very simple animal 

yet let i the loyal servant of simplicity 

what will you do what be you wise than your father will you direct i 

heaven forbid such insolence yet let i denounce my hearty hatred 

to what end 

though it be but in the prince ear since fit be not maiden blush to rail aloud 

go to go to 

let i but check his heat 

well well 

and take he down dear father from his full pride of hope 

So so I say once more go in 
I will not lose the glory of reproof 
be this the office of ambassador my lord Tiberio 
nay duty of a son nay pity of a man 
a figure call in art gradatio 
with some learned climax to court a royal lady 
for his master father or perchance his friend 
and yet intend the purchase of his beauty 
to his own use 

your grace do much amaze i 

ay fain dissemble alas we be now grow old weak sight alas any one fool we 

I deep vow my lord 

peace be not damn have pity on your soul 
I confess sweet prince for you to love my daughter 
young and witty of equal mixture both of mind and body 
be neither wondrous nor unnatural 
yet to forswear and vow against one heart

since it be most plain such speech do contemn 
heaven and fear man that be sentious now

unknowing can you blush my lord 
unknowing why can you write these line 
present this scarf unknowing my lord 
to my dear daughter umh unknowing

in your own right to she too easy breast 
that God know take too much compassion on you 
and so she pray i say unknowing my lord 
if you can act these thing unknowing 
know we can know your action so unknown 
for we be old I will not say in wit 
for even just worth must not approve itself 
but take your scarf for she vow she will not wear it

your presence therefore to a feastful wake 
tomorrow to Ferrara you return 
with wish answer to your royal father

which oh may never end 

yes fawn in time we must not prescribe to nature every thing there be some end in every thing 

but in a woman yet as she be a wife she be 
oftentimes the end of her husband 

shall I I say 

shall you I say confound your own fair hope 
across all your course of life make yourself vain 
to your once steady graveness and all to second
