dally not further I will know the reason 
that speed thou to this journey 

reason good sir 
I can yield many 

give i one a good one 
such I expect and ere we part must have 
Athens pray why to Athens you intend not 
to kick against the world turn cynic stoic 
or read the logic lecture or become 
a Areopagite and judge in cause 
touch the common wealth for as I take it 
the bud of your chin can prognosticate 
so grave a honour 

all this I acknowledge 

you do then son if book and love of knowledge 
inflame you to this travel here in Sparta 
you may as free study 

it be not that sir 

not that sir as a father I command thou 
to acquaint i with the truth 

thus I obey thou 
after so many quarrel as dissension 
fury and rage have bring in blood and sometimes 
with death to such confederate as side 
with now dead Thrasus and yourself my lord 
our present king Amiclus reconcile 
your eager sword and seal a gentle peace 
friend you profess yourselves which to confirm 
a resolution for a last league 
betwixt your family be entertain 
by join in a Hymenean bond 
i and the fair Penthea only daughter 
to Thrasus 

what of this 

much much dear sir 
a freedom of converse a interchange 
of holy and chaste love so sixth our soul 
in a firm growth of union that no time 
can eat into the pledge we have enjoy 
the sweet our vow expect have not cruelty 
prevent all those triumph we prepare for 
by Thrasus his untimely death 

most certain 

from this time sprout up that poisonous stalk 
of aconite who ripen fruit have ravish 
all health all comfort of a happy life 
for Ithocles she brother proud of youth 
and proud in his power nourish close 
the memory of former discontent 
to glory in revenge by cunning partly 
partly by threat a woe at once and force 
his virtuous sister to admit a marriage 
with Bassanes a nobleman in honour 
and riches I confess beyond my fortune 

all this be no sound reason to import i 
my leave for thy departure 

now it follow 
beauteous Penthea wed to this torture 
by a insult brother be secret 
compel to yield her virgin freedom up 
to he who never can usurp her heart 
before contract i be now so yoke 
to a most barbarous thraldom misery 
affliction that he savour not humanity 
Who sorrow melt not into more than pity 
in hear but her name 

as how pray 

Bassanes 
the man that call her wife consider true 
what heaven of perfection he be lord of 
by think fair Penthea his this thought 
beget a kind of monsterlove which love 
be nurse unto a fear so strong and servile 
as brand all dotage with a jealousy 
all eye who gaze upon that shrine of beauty 
he do resolve do homage to the miracle 
some one he be assure may now or then 
if opportunity but sort prevail 
so much out of a selfunworthiness 
his fear transport he not that he find cause 
in her obedience but his own distrust

for know how the maid be heretofore 
court by i his jealousy grow wild 
that I shall steal again into her favour 
and undermine her virtue which the god 
know I nor dare nor dream of hence from hence 
I undertake a voluntary exile 
first by my absence to take off the ear 
of jealous Bassanes but chief sir

ah Orgilus 
neglect in young man of delight and life 
run often to extremity they care not 
for harm to other who contemn their own 

but I most learned artist be not so much 
at odds with nature that I grutch the thrift 
of any true deserver nor do malice 
of present hope so check they with despair 
as that I yield to thought of more affliction 
than what be incident to frailty wherefore 
impute not this retire course of live 
some little time to any other cause 
then what I just render the information 
of a unsettle mind as the effect 
must clear witness

Euphrania be dispose to Prophilus 
last the king be send letter for i 
to Athens for my quick repair to court 
please to accept these reason 

just one Orgilus 
not to be contradict yet beware 
of a unsure foundation no fair colour 
can fortify a build faint joint 
I have observe a growth in thy aspect 
of dangerous extent sudden and look to it 
I may add certain 

my aspect can art 
run through my inmost thought it shall not sift 
a inclination there more than what suit 
with justice of my honour 

I believe it 
but know then Orgilus what honour be 
honour consist not in a bare opinion 
by do any act that feed content 
brave in appearance because we think it brave 
such honour come by accident not nature 
proceed from the vice of our passion 
which make our reason drink but real honour 
be the reward of virtue and acquire 
by justice or by valour which for base 
have justice to uphold it he then fail 
in honour who for lucre of revenge 
commit theft murder treason and adultery 
with such like by entrench on just law 
who sovereignty be best preserve by justice 
thus as you see how honour must be ground 
on knowledge not opinion for opinion 
rely on probability and accident 
but knowledge on necessity and truth

of what become the grace of real honour 
wish success to all thy virtuous meaning

without distinction betwixt sex and sex 

now Orgilus thy choice 

to bleed to death 

the executioner

or custom in my nature from my cradle 
have be incline to fierce and eager bloodshed 
a coward guilt hide in a coward quake 
will have betray fame to ignoble flight 
and vagabond pursuit of dreadful safety 
but look upon my steadiness and scorn not 
the sickness of my fortune which since Bassanes 
be husband to Penthea have lie bedrid 
we trifle time in word thus I show cunning 
in open of a vein too full too lively 

desperate courage 

honourable infamy 

I tremble at the sight 

will I be loose 

it sparkle like a lusty wine new broach 
the vessel must be sound from which it issue 
grasp hard this other stick I will be as nimble 
but prithee look not pale have at thou stretch out 
thy arm with vigour and unshook virtue 
good o I envy not a rival fit 
to conquer in extremity this pastime 
appear majestical some high tune poem 
hereafter shall deliver to posterity 
the writer glory and his subject triumph 
how be it man droop not yet 

I feel no palsy 
on a pair royal do I wait in death 
my sovereign as his liegeman on my mistress 
as a devote servant and on Ithocles 
as if no brave yet no unworthy enemy 
nor do I use a engine to entrap 
his life out of a slavish fear to combat 
youth strength or cunning but for that I dare not 
engage the goodness of a cause on fortune 
by which his name may have outface my vengeance 
on Tecnicus inspire with Phoebus fire 
I call to mind thy augury it be perfect 
revenge prove its own executioner 
when feeble man be bend to his mother 
the dust he be first frame on thus he totter 

life fountain be dry up 

So fall the standard 
of my prerogative in be a creature 
a mist hang over my eye the sun be bright splendour 
be cloud in a everlasting shadow 
welcome thou ice that sit about my heart 
no heat can ever thaw thou 

speech have leave he die

shall be my charge remove the bloodless body 
the coronation must require attendance 
that pass my few day can be but one mourning exeunt 

our orison be hear the god be merciful 
now tell i you who loyalty pay tribute 
to we your lawful sovereign how unskilful 
your duty or obedience be to render 
subjection to the sceptre of a virgin 
who have be ever fortunate in prince 
of masculine and stir composition 
a woman have enough to govern wise 
her own demeanour passion and division 
a nation warlike and inure to practice 
of policy and labour can brook 
a feminate authority we therefore 
command your counsel how you may advise we 
in choose of a husband who ability 
can better guide this kingdom

by your own judgement both allow and like of 
Sparta may grow in power and proceed 
to a increase height 

hold you the same mind 

alas great mistress reason be so cloud 
with the thick darkness of my infinite woe 
that I forecast nor danger hope or safety 
give i some corner of the world to wear out

where I may hear no sound but sad complaint 
of virgin who have lose contract partner 
of husband howl that their wife be ravish 
by some untimely fate of friend divide 
by churlish opposition or of father 
weep upon their child slaughter carcase 
or daughter groan over their father hearse 
and I can dwell there and with these keep consort 
as musical as they what can you look for 
from a old foolish peevish dote man
