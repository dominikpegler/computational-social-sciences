
come to Caesarea tonight 

most true sir 

the emperor in person 

do I hue 

it be wondrous strange the march of great prince 
like to the motion of prodigious meteor 
be step by step observe and loud tongue fame 
the hat binger to prepare their entertainment 
and be it possible so great a army 
though cover with the night can be so near 
the governor can be so unfriended 
among the many that attend his person 
but by some secret mean he shall have notice 
of Caesar purpose in this then excuse i 
if I appear incredulous 

at your pleasure 

yet when I call to mind you never fail i 
in thing more difficult but have discover 
deed that be do thousand league distant from i 
when neither wood nor cave not secret vault 
no nor the power they serve can keep these Christian 
or from my reach or punishment but thy magic 
still lay they open I begin again 
to be as confident as heretofore 
it be not possible thy powerful art 
shall meet a check or fail 


look on these vestal 
the holy pledge that the god have give you 
your chaste fair daughter be it not to upbraid 
a service to a master not unthankful 
I can say this in spite of your prevention 
seduce by a imagine faith not reason 
which be the strength of nature quite forsake 
the Gentile god have yield up themselves 
to this new find religion this I cross 
discover their intention teach you to use 
with gentle word and mild persuasion 
the power and the authority of a father 
set of with cruel threat and so reclaim they 
and whereas they with torment shall have die 
hell fury to i have they undergo it aside 
they be now votary in great Jupiter temple 
and by his priest instruct grow familiar 
with all the mystery nay the most abstruse one 
belong to his deity 

it be a benefit 
for which I ever owe you hail jove flamen 
have these my daughter reconcile themselves 
abandon for ever the christian way 
to your opinion 

and be constant in it 
they teach their teacher with their depth of judgement 
and be with argument able to convert 
the enemy to our god and answer all 
they can object against we 

my dear daughter 

we dare dispute against this new spring sect 
in private or public 

my best lady 
persevere in it 

and what we maintain 
we will seal with our blood 

brave resolution 
I even grow fat to see my labor prosper 

I young again to your devotion 

do 
my prayer be present with you 

o my Harpax 
thou engine of my wish thou that steel 
my bloody resolution thou that arm 
my eye against womanish tear and soft compassion 
instruct i without a sigh to look on 
babe tear by violence from their mother breast 
to feed the fire and with they make one flame 
old man as beast in beast skin tear by dog 
virgin and matron tire the executioner 
yet I unsatisfy think their torment easy 

and in that just not cruel 

wear all sceptre 
that grace the hand of king make into one 
and offer i all crown lay at my foot 
I will contemn they all thus spit at they 
so I to all posterity may be call 
the strong champion of the pagan god 
and rooter out of Christian 

o my own 
i own dear lord to further this great work 
I ever live thy slave 


no more the governor 

keep the port close and let the guard be double 
disarm the Christian call it death in any 
to wear a sword or in his house to have one 

I shall be careful sir 

it will well become you 
such as refuse to offer sacrifice 
to any of our god put to the torture 
grub up this grow mischief by the root 
and know when we be merciful to they 
we to ourselves be cruel 

you pour oil 
on fire that burn already at the height 
I know the emperor edict and my charge 
and they shall find no favour 

my good lord 
this care be timely for the entertainment 
of our great master who this night in person 
come here to thank you 

who the emperor 

to clear your doubt he do return in triumph 
king lackey by his triumphant chariot 
and in this glorious victory my lord 
you have a ample share for know your son 
the near enough commend Antoninus 
so well have flesh his maiden sword and die 
his snowy plume so deep in enemy blood 
that beside public grace beyond his hope 
there be reward propound 

I will know 
no mean in thou can this be true 

my head answer the forfeit 

of his victory 
there be some rumor but it be assure 
the army pass a full day journey high 
into the country 

it be so determine 
but for the further honour of your son 
and to observe the government of the city 
and with what rigor or remiss indulgence 
the Christian be pursue he make his stay here 
for proof his trumpet speak his near arrival trumpet afar of 

haste good Sempronius draw up our guard 
and with all ceremonious pomp receive 
the conquer army let our garrison speak 
their welcome in loud shout the city show 
her state and wealth 

I be go 

o I be ravish 
with this great honour cherish good Theophilus 
this know scholar send your fair daughter 
I will present they to the emperor 
and in their sweet conversion as a mirror 
express your zeal and duty a lesson of cornet 

fetch they good Harpax 

so at all part I find Caesarea 
complete govern the licentious soldier 
confine in modest limit and the people 
teach to obey and not compel with rigor 
the ancient roman discipline revive 
which raise room to her greatness and proclaim she 
the glorious mistress of the conquer world 
but above all the service of the god 
so zealous observe that good Sapritius 
in word to thank you for your care and duty 
be much unworthy Dioclesian honour 
or his magnificence to his loyal servant 
but I shall find a time with noble title 
to recompense your merit 

mighty Caesar 
who power upon this globe of earth be equal 
to love in heaven who victorious triumph 
on proud rebellious king that stir against it 
be perfect figure of his immortal trophy 
win in the giant war who conquer sword 
guide by his strong arm as deadly kill 
as do his thunder all that I have do 
or if my strength be centuple can do 
come short of what my loyalty must challenge 
but if in any thing I have deserve 
great Caesar smile it be in my humble care 
still to preserve the honour of those god 
that make he what he be my zeal to they 
I ever have express in my fell hate 
against the christian sect that with one blow 
ascribe all thing to a unknown power 
will strike down all their temple and allow they 
nor sacrifice nor altar 

thou in this 
walk hand in hand with i my will and power 
shall not alone confirm but honour all 
that be in this most forward 

sacred Caesar 
if your imperial majesty stand please 
to shower your favour upon such as be 
the bold champion of our religion 
look on this reverend man to who the power 
of search out and punish such delinquent 
be by your choice commit and for proof 
he have deserve the grace impose upon he 
and with a fair and even hand proceed 
partial to none not to himself or those 
of equal nearness to himself behold 
this pair of virgin 

what be these 

his daughter 

now by your sacred fortune they be fair one 
exceed fair one will it be in my power 
to make they i 

they be the god great lady 
they be most happy in your service else 
on these when they fall from their father faith 
I use a judge power entreaty fail 
they be seduce to win they to adore 
the holy power we worship I put on 
the scarlet robe of bold authority 
and as they have be stranger to my blood 
present they in the most horrid form 
all kind of torture part of which they suffer 
with Roman constancy 

and can you endure 
be a father to behold their limb 
extend on the rack 

I do but must 
confess there be a strange contention in i 
between the impartial office of a judge 
and pity of a father to help justice 
religion step in under which odds 
compassion fall yet still I be a father 
for even then when the flinty hangman whip 
be wear with stripe spend on their tender limb 
I kneel and weep and beg they though they will 
be cruel to themselves they will take pity 
on my grey hair now note a sudden change 
which I with joy remember those who torture 
nor fear of death can terrify be overcome 
by see of my suffering and so win 
return to the faith that they be bear in 
I give they to the god and be assure 
I that use justice with a rigorous hand 
upon such beauteous virgin and my own 
will use no favour where the cause command i 
to any other but as rock be deaf 
to all entreaty 

thou deserve thy place 
still hold it and with honour thing thus order 
touch the god it be lawful to descend 
to human care and exercise that power 
heaven have confer upon i which that you 
rebel and traitor to the power of Rome 
shall not with all extremity undergo 
what can you urge to qualify your crime 
or mitigate my anger 

we be now 
slave to thy power that yesterday be king 
and have command over other we confess 
our grandsire pay you tribute yet leave we 
as their forefather have desire of freedom 
and if you roman hold it glorious honour 
not only to defend what be your own 
but to enlarge your empire though our fortune 
deny that happiness who can accuse 
the famish mouth if it attempt to feed 
or such who fetter eat into their freedom 
if they desire to shake they off 

we stand 
the last example to prove how uncertain 
all humane happiness be and be prepare 
to endure the worst 

that speak which now be high 
in fortune wheel must when she turn it next 
decline as low as we be This consider 
teach the egyptian Hercules Sesostris 
that have his chariot draw by captive king 
to free they from that slavery but to hope 
such mercy from a roman be mere madness 
we be familiar with what cruelty 
room since her infant greatness ever use 
such as she triumph over age nor sex 
exempt from her tyranny sceptre prince 
keep in your common dungeon and their child 
in scorn train up in base mechanic art 
for public bondman in the catalogue 
of those unfortunate man we expect to have 
our name remember 

in all grow empire 
even cruelty be useful some must suffer 
and be set up example to strike terror 
in other though far off but when a state 
be raise to her perfection and her base 
too firm to shrink or yield we may use mercy 
and do it with safety but to who not coward 
or such who baseness shame the conqueror 
and rob he of his victory as weak Perseus 
do great Aemilius know therefore king 
of Epire Pontus and of Macedon 
that I with courtesy can use my prisoner 
as well as make they i by force provide 
that they be noble enemy such I find you 
before I make you i and since you be so 
you have not lose the courage of prince 
although the fortune have you bear yourselves 
deject and base no slavery 
have be too easy for you but such be 
the power of noble valour that we love it 
even in our enemy and take with it 
desire to make they friend as I will you 

mock we not Caesar 

by the god I do not 
unloose their bond I now as friend embrace you 
give they their crown again 

we be twice overcome 
by courage and by courtesy 

but this latter 
shall teach we to live ever faithful vassal 
to Dioclesian and the power of Rome 

all kingdom fall before she 

and all king 
contend to honour Cesar 

I believe 
your tongue be the true trumpet of your heart 
and in it I most happy queen of fate 
imperious fortune mix some light disaster 
with my so many joy to season they 
and give they sweet relish I be gird round 
with true felicity faithful subject here 
here bold commander here with new make friend 
but what be the crown of all in thou Artemia 
my only child who love to i and duty 
strive to exceed each other 

I make payment 
but of a debt which I stand bind to tender 
as a daughter and a subject 

which require yet 
a retribution from i Artemia 
tie by a father care how to bestow 
aye well of all thing to i most precious 
nor will I therefore long keep thou from 
the chief joy of creation marriage rite 
which that thou may with great pleasure taste of 
thou shall not like with my eye but thy own 
among these king forget they be captive 
or these remember not they be my subject 
make choice of any by jove dreadful thunder 
my will shall rank with thou 

it be a bounty 
the daughter of great prince seldom meet with 
for they to make up breach in the state 
or for some other politic end be force 
to match where they affect not may my life 
deserve this favour 

speak I long to know 
the man thou will make happy 

if that title 
or the adore name of queen can take i 
here will I fix my eye and look no far 
but these be bait to take a mean bear lady 
neither that bold may call Caesar father 
in that I can bring honour unto any 
but from no king that live receive addition 
to raise desert and virtue by my fortune 
though in a low estate be great glory 
than to mix greatness with a prince that owe 
no worth but that name only 

I commend thou 
it be like thyself 

if then of man beneath i 
my choice be to be make where shall I seek 
but among those that best deserve from you 
that have serve you most faithful that in danger 
have stand next to you that have interpose 
their breast as shield of proof to dull the sword 
aim at your bosom that have spend their blood 
to crown your brow with laurel 

Cytherea 
great queen of love be now propitious to i 

now mark what I foretell 

her eye on i 
fair Venus son draw forth a leaden dart 
and that she may hate i transfix she with it 
or if thou needs will use a golden one 
shoot in the behalf of any other 
thou know I be thy votary else where

as I look on the temple or the god 
and with that reverence lady I behold you 
and shall do ever 

and it will become you 
while thus we stand at distance but if love

say I put off the dreadful a we that wait 
on majesty or with you share my beam 
nay make you to outshine i change the name 
of subject into lord rob you of service 
that be due from you to i and in i make it

and cherish it in a king there it shine bright 
and yield the brave lustre look on Epire

and let it not disgrace he that he be 
overcome by Caesar it be a victory 
to stand so long against he have you see he

the part of a commander and a soldier 
wise in direction bold in execution 
you will have say great Caesar self except 
the world yield not his equal

call their abundance want what can you wish 
that be not fall upon you honour greatness 
respect wealth favour the whole world for a dowry 
and with a princess who excel form 
exceed her fortune

and no essential food when I be scorch 
with fire can flame in any other quench i 
what be her love to i greatness or empire

that lead to joy eternal in the place 
of loose lascivious mirth he will have stir you 
to holy meditation and so far

slave will shrink under 

have you not cleave feetel be you not devil 
Dare any say so much or dare I hear it 
without a virtuous and religious anger 
now to put on a virgin modesty 
or maiden silence when his power be question

for which the devil angle your false pleasure 
a steep descent by which you headlong fall 
into eternal torment 

do not tempt 
our powerful god 

which of your powerful god

that can nor do i hurt nor protect you 
most pity woman will you sacrifice

to be hereafter register a goddess 
give your chaste body up to the embrace 
of goatish lust have it write on your forehead

incestuous with his sister read but those 
that have canonize they you will find they worse 
than in chaste language I can speak they to you

of humane weakness and have ample share 
in man most base affection subject to 
unchaste love anger bondage wound as man be 
her jupiter to serve his lust turn bull

Neptune for gain build up the wall of Troy 
as a daylabourer Apollo keep 
Admetus sheep for bread the Lemnian smith

with his still grow liver feed the vulture 
Saturn bind fast in hell with adamant chain 
and thousand more on who abuse error 
bestow a deity will you then dear sister 
for I will have you such pay your devotion 
to thing of less power than yourselves 

we worship 
their good deed in their image 

by who fashion 
by sinful man I will tell you a short tale 
nor can you but confess it be a true one 
a king of Egypt be to erect 
the image of Osiris who they honour 
take from the matron neck the rich jewel 
and pure gold as the material 
to finish up his work which perfect 
with all solemnity he set it up 
to be adore and serve himself his idol 
desire it to give he victory 
against his enemy but be overthrow 
enrage against his god these be fine god 
subject to humane fury he take down 
the senseless thing and melt it again 
he make a basin in which eunuch wash 
his concubine foot and for this for do use 
some month it serve he mistress prove false 
as most indeed do so and grace conclude 
between he and the priest of the same basin 
he make his god again think think of this 
and then consider if all worldly honour 
or pleasure that do leave sharp sting behind they 
have power to win such as have reasonable soul 
to put their trust in dross 

o that I have be bear 
without a father 

piety to he 
have ruine we for ever 

think not so 
you may repair all yet the attribute 
that speak his godhead most be merciful 
revenge be proper to the fiend you worship 
yet can strike without his leave you weep 
o it be a heavenly shower celestial balm 
to cure your wound conscience let it fall 
fall thick upon it and when that be spend 
I will help it with another of my tear 
and may your true repentance prove the child 
of my true sorrow never mother have 
a birth so happy 

we be catch ourselves 
that come to take you and assure of conquest 
we be your captive 

and in that you triumph 
your victory have be eternal loss 
and this your loss immortal gain fix here 
and you shall feel yourselves inward arm 
against torture death and hell but take heed sister 
that or through weakness threat or mild persuasion 
though of a father you fall not into 
a second and a worse apostasy

and rest assure the more you suffer here 
the more your glory you to heaven more dear

the devil dispatch thou 

death this day ride in triumph Theophilus 
see this witch make away to 

my soul thirst for it 
come I myself thy hangman part can play 

o hasten i to my coronation day 


be this the place where virtue be to suffer 
and heavenly beauty leave this base earth 
to make a glad return from whence it come 
be it Macrinus a scaffold thrust forth 

by this preparation 
you well may rest assure that Dorothea 
this hour be to die here 

then with her die 
the abstract of all sweetness that be in woman 
set i down friend that ere the iron hand 
of death close up my eye they may at once 
take my last leave both of this light and she 
for she be go the glorious sun himself 
to i be Cimmerian darkness 

strange affection 
Cupid once more have change his shaft with death 
and kill in stead of give life 

nay weep not 
though tear of friendship be a sovereign balm 
on i they be cast a way it be decree 
that I must die with she our clew of life 
be spin together 

yet sir it be my wonder 
that you who hear only what she suffer 
partake of all her torture yet will be 
to add to your calamity a eye witness 
of her last tragic scene which must pierce deep 
and make the wound more desperate 

o Macrinus 
it will linger out my torment self not kill i 
which be the end I aim at be to die to 
what instrument more glorious can I wish for 
then what be make sharp by my constant love 
and true affection it may be the duty 
and loyal service with which I pursue she 
and seal it with my death will be remember 
among her bless action and what honour 
can I desire beyond it 
see she come 
how sweet her innocence appear more like 
to heaven itself then any sacrifice 
that can be offer to it by my hope 
of joy hereafter the sight make i doubtful 
in my belief nor can I think our god 
be good or to be serve that take delight 
in offering of this kind that to maintain 
their power do face the master piece of nature 
which they themselves come short of she ascend 
an every step raise she near heaven 
what god soever thou be that most enjoy she 
receive in she a boundless happiness 

you be too blame 
to let he come abroad 

it be his will 
and we be leave to serve he not command he 

good sir be not offend nor deny 
my last of pleasure in this happy object 
that I shall ere be bless with 

now proud contemner 
of we and of our god tremble to think 
it be not in the power thou serve to save thou 
not all the riches of the sea increase 
by violent shipwrack nor the unsearched mine 
Mammon unknown exchequer shall redeem thou 
and therefore have first with horror weigh 
what it be to die and to die young to part with 
all pleasure and delight last to go 
where all antipathy to comfort dwell 
fury behind about thou and before thou 
and to add to affliction the remembrance 
of the elysian joy thou may have taste 
have thou not turn apostata to those god 
that so reward their servant let despair 
prevent the hangman sword and on this scaffold 
make thy first entrance into hell 

she smile 
unmoved by Mars as if she be assure 
death look on her constancy will forget 
the use of his inevitable hand 

deride to dispatch I say 

thou fool 
that glory in have power to ravish 
a trifle from i I be weary of 
what be this life to i not worth a thought 
or if to be esteem it be that I lose it 
to win a better even thy realice serve 
to i but as a ladder to mount up 
to such a height of happiness where I shall 
look down with scorn on thou and on the world 
where circle with true pleasure place above 
the reach of death or time it will be my glory 
to think at what a easy price I buy it 
there be a perpetual spring perpetual youth 
no joint benumb cold nor scorch heat 
famine nor age have any be there 
forget for shame your Tempe bury in 
oblivion your feign your hesperian orchard 
the golden fruit keep by the watchful dragon 
which do require Hercules to get it 
compare with what grow in all plenty there 
deserve not to be name the power I serve 
laugh at your happy Arabia or the 
elysian shade for he have make his bower 
better indeed than you can fancy you 

o take i thither with you

and be assure you shall 

with my own hand 
he rather stop that little breath be leave thou 
and rob thy kill fever 

by no mean 
let he go with she do seduce young man 
and wait upon thy saint in death do do 
and when you come to that imagine place 
that place of all delight pray you observe i 
and meet those curse thing I once call daughter 
who I have send as harbinger before you

her wealth and honour sink no fear of want

at a immortal crown and in his cause 
who only can bestow it who send down 
legion of minister angel to bear up

in all thy journey and now in the evening 
when thou shall pass with honour to thy rest 
will thou fall like a meteor 

yet confess 
that thou be mad and that thy tongue and heart
