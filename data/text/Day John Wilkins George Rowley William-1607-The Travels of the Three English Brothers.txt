a cannibal Dalibra will eat man 

why not madam fine man can choose but be fine meat 

ay but they be a fill meat 

why so be most of your sweet meat but if a woman have a true appetite to they they will venture that 

I will not be free of that company of venturer 

what though their voyage be somewhat dangerous they be but short they will finish one of their voyage in forty week and with in a month after hoist sail and to it again for another 

you sail clean from the compass Dalibra I only question you about the christian habit and behaviour 

that be like their condition very civil and comely 

ay but they be stranger Dalibra 

stranger I see no strangeness in they they speak as well or rather better than our own countryman and I make no question can do aswell if it come once to execution 

there valour show in the late overthrow of the Turk seal that for currant 

and yet there be some about the sophy your uncle that look with a sullen brow upon they 

I hold they the more worthy for that for envy and malice be always stab at the bosom of worth when folly and cowardice walk up and down in regardless security and here come one of they 

health to your ladyship 

in wine or beer my lord

march with the rest of mean action 
like star among a regiment of planet 
shine with the rest tho much below the rest 

that be very strange it come to we by letter 
the english brother take more prisoner 
then any four commander in the camp 

indeed they take some straggle runagate 
poor heartless snake that scarce have strength to crawl 
but have you see the valiant prince my brother 

do any thing worth note I shall commend he for it nor be the elder of the english sherly employ in ambassage to Christendom 

only for guide unto my warlike brother 
but neither privy to the business 
nor party join in his commission 

then fame be a liar 

madam my brother do commend himself 

he can do little and he can not commend himself but who come here 

the young brother of the sherley madam

compose of such a rich perfection 
as valour seem his servant aught with we 

as servant to their lord subject to king 
love mix with duty worthless Shirley bring

alas we be man but mean qualify 
to the rich worthy of our english soil 
and shall they hear what prodigal report

of earth slimed earth and have no great style 
than you have but a man 
and if your blood have the same heat as i 
we will never back unto our mother country but our stream 
shall lose his vital way or be a theme 
unto our sanguine brother how to raise 
paean of triumph in our virtue praise 
or else even here this be our fatal lot 
we will die unknown so bury and forget 

while we have life even against this rocky town

you be our general and with you we will stand 
who fear not seastorm shrink not be aland 

I thank you all be but your action thus

this tongue proclaim to they we be hither come 
with soldier hand that bring destruction 
to they and their fence town if they hold out 
ourself will take their answer if it be proud 
the spoil be you the earth for they a shroud 
arm then as I do 

it be for hope of wealth 

and pagan glory to enrich we with 

at my return we will fight to purchase gold 
or take it with ease which hope make coward bold 

but who too venturous general shall know 
in steed of gold may meet his overthrow 
for tell i sailor and my fellow mate 
what gain may be expect from this town 
that we shall venture for nay what from he 
we term our general of worth or rule

where what pillage we can make our prey 
it will be our own and we to none obey 

degenerous man 
so big of bone and yet so base of mind 
to counsel against he so good then 
what though our fortune with ungentle hand 
have cross his enterprise and action 
can then to he who bounty give thou mean 
preferment grace beyond thy merit worth 
poison thyself and make thy tongue a sting 
against his life that give thy fortune wing 

what be do be past time be fortune to come

let we now recount our victory today 
what prisoner have we take 

between thirty and forty of their chief commander 

between thirty and forty of their chief commander 
we be now here the persian substitute 
and can use our Christian clemency 
to spare a life off with all their head 
speak do you renounce your prophet Mahomet 
bow to the deity that we adore 
or die in the refusal 

for Mahomet we die 

join mortus aly then with Mahomet 
that slay your prophet Hamer and Usman 
and on a snowy camel go to heaven 
and yet you shall find grace in Persia 

for Mahomet none but Mahomet 

to death with they the rest shall follow 

I have somewhat to deliver ere I die 

be thou a convertite we will hear thou not else 

then I must be silent I will choose to die 
before the faith I do profess deny

so that my brother stand in armour here

so heaven have aid i thrice against these Turk 
that they will hate the man that love i 
and to my name they add Shirley the great 
though my humility I vow by heaven

but if they do refuse this proffer gift 
Shirley shall wish to be no other great 
than to be great in their great over throw 
if that he die within their captive thrall 
ten thousand Turk shall mourn his funeral 

thus like the sun in his meridian pride 
attend by a regiment of star 
stand we triumphant among our petty king 
upon the high promont of either globe 
that heave his forehead near to the cloud 
fix we our foot and with our eagles wing 
canopy over three quarter of the world 
and yet we write non ultra the proud sophey 
the persian beggar that by start invade we 
our potent army like so many wolf 
let loose into a flock of fenceless sheep 
shall bait and warray home into their fold 
while fate and conquest our high state uphold 

yet mighty and magnificent your power 
in this late conflict against Persia 
have meet much loss 

base and degenerate coward 
be not we Hamath the sole god of earth 
king of all king provost of paradise

of catheria Egypt Antioch 
lord of the precious stone of India 
a champion and defendor of the god

we rather judge nay absolute know 
thou either art ally to he by birth 
or some great prince which till thou do confess 
thy torment shall be more thy freedom less 
as for our captain let they live or die 
the christian shall in slavish iron lie

grave father for the reverence of your age 
and justice of the cause for which you come 
be to advance the glory of our god 
wherein no soul shall have neglectful thought 
I have lie by particular affair 
to give a hear to your business 

go on my son to he be dutiful 
virtue will make thy name more honourable 
myself from far have on these age foot 
who knee do buckle and have scarce there strength 
to bear i further than a grave in length 
with easy pace but a swift desire 
enquire thou out that hear thou a christian 
so gracious with this persian emperor 
a mind so noble in thy action 
a body fortunate in his design 
thou might as well bestow thy pain and blood 
to advance religion as for heathen good 

heaven know 
know I the mean I be his willing servant 

if like thy tongue thy intention have a care 
climb up to heaven by this ascend stair 
entreat thy emperor thou may raise a church 
to sacrifice thy prayer unto that name 
to who all name shall kneel when if his priest 
himself his counsel any heathen breath 
shall contradict the high authority 
of thy devote zeal spare not to say 
their god his servant who thy thought obey 
and win as by persuasion king be win 
or else confute they by religion 

Alas sir my ungrown experience 
to argue a difference of that height 
betwixt their god and we be so far unfit 
I rather shall abuse then honour it 

why why my son do thou forget to know 
our god the spring whence eloquence do flow 
and can infuse into thou be thou dumb 
word thunderlike a contradictless tongue 
that when thou speak for the honour of that name 
make earth to hang betwixt yond heavenly frame 
bear on no axletree angel do sit 
about thy ear and breath into thy wit 
and if thou shall in such a quarrel die 
martyr look on thou with a joyful eye 

you have give unto my life another soul 
and never reverend father can you have come 
in time that be fit wherein I may prove 
my duty to the high to Christian love 
this present day I have a infant bear 
who though descend from the emperor niece 
a pagan I will baptise in christian faith 
confute there ignorance heaven assist i 
that my one soul this comfort may partake 
Shirley in Persia do the first christian make 
then raise a temple for our further good 
or in the fair adventure spend my blood 

in all necessity I will further thou 
and if by my advice thou die I will die with thou 

and so to die your life be new begin 
old age to die with he a make god son 

Haly go on and of your great affair 
deliver we every several circumstance 

from thence I leave dread sovereign thus ensue 
that Shirley who you join with i in embassy 
have our foot once on christian ground 
become so proud so wild so prodigal 
all eye contemn he only some few 
that give his rise look but for the dew 
your grace bestow on he in prince court 
his fellowship be fool his action sport 
for wisemen table I often do advise he 
that such behaviour no way do befit 
the glory of his place nor will you suffer it 
when his return give place for punishment 
when first in Russia he abuse your greatness 
for which the just state do imprison he 
yet for the honour of the cause in hand 
ere long he be release we come to Rome 
where I but strive to ascend as chief 
be in person there your sacred self 
his hand first strike i while his tongue do chime 
no pagan must ascend where Christian climb 

dare he say so 

he do my lord 
yet pass we thence to Venice where as before 
he keep his flood of riot and abuse 
for which he be there keep prisoner and the state 
return i back nothing determine of 

now may my sovereign evident see 
their subtle gloss have this inward kind 
they will wound your heart though seem to please your mind 

by day if this be true not Christian live 
within the compass where our word may kill 
speak 
how can thou answer this appeal of they 

o let the emperor but desist a while 
from the remembrance of a tale he hear 
or else but think great man may face a lie 
till truth appear and give their check a die 
these letter in your eye first speak for i 
while in their ear a story I will unfold 
shall make their head shake and their heart cold 
the first from Russia where this envious man 
accuse my brother as a fugitive 
a thief a pirate and a christian spy 
for which he be imprison till evident 
the state have knowledge of his innocence 
then he release send that intelligence 
at Rome I not deny my brother strike he 
for pride so just the father of that seat 
in his behalf do in his letter speak 
now let your eye but look what Venice write 
that this man by suggestion wrought the state 
against my brother labour withhold the treasure 
your princely self send to discharge the jew 
for the rich jewel that my brother buy 
and all the benefit to Christendom 
and to your honour be by he undo 

treason unheard of such shall the revenge be 
his silence and his look approve his guilt 
great Shirley at thy censure there he stand 
to doom he death may equal his offence 
unto thy brother life he stretch his sin 
be his alike we free give thou he 

then here be my justice for so vile a crime 
since that it reach unto my brother life 
and blemish of his honour and his worth 
and hinder that ordain for christian glory 
he shall confess unto your sacred self 
all treason in those letter mention 
to be his plot and action against my brother 
and tell the world to shut up scandal tongue 
all that thou do from root of envy spring 
and no desert of his they satisfy 
for all conspiracy all envy sin 
we thus will love thou learn but to love he

to have be a villain to that gentleman 
deserve so well of all man best of i 
great emperor not a letter that be there 
if every character be double twice 
but the attempt be i against his life 
death I have deserve then much I owe to thou 
that may have take my life and set i free

to deal for we as we ourself be there 
which dignity of we thy tongue profane 
for which we do adjudge thou lose thy tongue 
we make thy hand like we to strike or spare 
which power and grace of we thou do abuse 
for which thou shall go handless to thy grave 
and that thy head that make the rest offend
