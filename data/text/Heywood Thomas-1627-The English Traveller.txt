oh friend that I to my own notion 
have join but your experience I have the 
theoric but you the practice 

I perhaps have see what you have only read of 

there be your happiness 
a scholar in his study know the star 
their motion and their influence which be fix 
and which be wander can decipher sea 
and give each several land his proper bound 
but set he to the compass he be to seek 
when a plain pilot can direct his course 
from hence unto both the Indies can bring back 
his ship and charge with profit quintuple 
I have read jerusalem and study Rome 
can tell in what degree each city stand 
describe the distance of this place from that 
all this the scale in every map can teach 
nay for a need can punctual recite 
the monument in either but what I 
have by relation only knowledge by travel 
which still make up a complete gentleman 
prove eminent in you 

I must confess 
I have see jerusalem and Rome have bring 
mark from the one from the other testimony 
know Spain and France and from their air have suck 
a breath of every language but no more 
of this discourse since we draw near the place 
of they we go to visit

o it be a good old man 

and she a lady 
for beauty and for virtue unparalleled 
nor can you name that thing to grace a woman 
she have not in a full perfection 
though in their year may seem disparity 
and therefore at the first a match unfit 
imagine but his age and government 
withal her modesty and chaste respect 
betwixt they there be so sweet a sympathy 
as crown a noble marriage 

it be acknowledge 
but to the worthy gentleman himself 
I be so bind in many courtesy 
that not the least by all the expression 
my labour or my industry can show 
I will know how to cancel 

o you be modest

and be so wed to my company

although so near a neighbour 

This approve you 
to be most noble property that from one

I must bestow on his unmerited jove 
as one that know I have it and yet ignorant

nor have I that exceed 

sir my husband 
have take much pleasure in your strange discourse 
about jerusalem and the holy land 
how the new city differ from the old 
what ruin of the temple yet remain 
and whether Zion and those hill about 
with these adjacent town and village 
keep that proportion distance as we read 
and then in Rome of that great pyramid 
rear in the front on four lion mount 
how many of those idol temple stand 
first dedicate to their heathen god 
which ruine which to better use repair 
of their Pantheon and their Capitol 
what structure be demolish what remain 

and what more pleasure to a old man ear 
that never draw save his own country air 
then hear such thing relate I do exceed he 
in year I must confess yet he much old 
than I in his experience 

master Geraldine 
may I be bold to ask you but one question 
the which I will be resolve in 

any thing that lie within my knowledge 

put he to it 
do sister you shall find he make no doubt 
most pregnant in his answer 

in your travel 
through France through Savoy and through Italy 
Spain and the empire Greece and Palestine 
which breed the choice beauty 

introth lady 
I never cast on any in those part 
a curious eye of censure since my travel 
be only aim at language and to know 
these past i but as common object do 
see but not much regard 

o you strive 
to express a most unheard of modesty 
and seldom find in any traveller 
especial of our country thereby seek 
to make yourself peculiar 

I shall be loath 
profess in outward show to be one man 
and prove myself another 

one thing more 
be you to marry you that know these climb 
their state and their condition out of which 
of all these country will you choose your wife 

I will answer you in brief as I observe 
each several clime for object fare or use 
afford within itself for all of these 
what be most please to the man there bear 
Spain that yield scant of food afford the nation 
a parsimonious stomach where our appetite 
be not content but with the large excess 
of a full table where the please fruit 
be find most frequent there they best content 
where plenty flow it ask abundant feast 
for so have provident nature deal with all 
so in the choice of woman the greek wantoness 
compel beneath the turkish slavery 
vassal themselves to all man and such best 
please the voluptuous that delight in change 
the french be of one humour Spain another 
the hot italian he be a strain from both 
all please with their own nation even the moor 
he think the black the most beautiful 
and lady since you so far tax my choice 
I will thus resolve you be a english man 
amongst all these nation I have see or try 
to please i best here will I choose my bride 

and happy be that lady in my thought 
who you will deign that grace too 

how now sister

yes and you be in the way go 

to what may young man best compare themselves 
better to what than to a house new build 
the fabric strong the chamber well contrive 
polish within without well beautify 
when all that gaze upon the edifice 
do not alone commend the workman craft 
but either make it their fair precedent 
by which to build another or at least 
wish there to inhabit be set to sale 
in come a slothful tenant with a family 
as lazy and debauch rough tempest rise 
untile the roof which by their idleness 
leave unrepaired the stormy shower beat in 
rot the main post and rafter spoil the room 
deface the ceiling and in little space 
bring it to utter ruin yet the fault 
not in the architector that first rear it 
but he that shall repair it so it fare 
with we young man we be those house make 
our parent raise these structure the foundation 
lay in our infancy and as we grow 
in year they strive to build we by degree 
story on story high up at height 
they cover we with council to defend we 
from storm without they polish we within 
with learning knowledge art and discipline 
all that be nought and vicious they sweep from we 
like dust and cobweb and our room conceal 
hang with the costly hang about the wall 
emblem and beauteous symbol picture round 
but when that lazy tenant love step in 
and in his train bring sloth and negligence 
lust disobedience and profuse excess 
the thrist with which our father tile our roof 
submit to every storm and winter blast 
And yield place to every riotous sin 
give way without to ruin what be within 
such be the state I stand in 

and how do this tire become i 

rather ask how your sweet carriage 
and court behaviour do best grace you for lover regard 
not so much the outward habit as that which the garment cover 

o here be that hail shower tempest storm and gust 
that shatter have this build let in lust 
intemperance appetite to vice withal 
neglect of every goodness thus I see 
how I be sink in my own disease 
yet can I not abide it 

and how this gown I prithee view i well 
and speak with thy best judgement 

what do you talk of gown and ornament 
that have a beauty precious in itself 
and become any thing 

let i not live but she speak nought but truth 
and I will for that reward she 

all be one to i become they i or not 
or be I fair or foul in other eye 
so I appear so to my Lionel 
he be the glass in who I judge my face 
by who in order I will dress these curl 
and place these jewel only to please he 
why do smile 

to here a woman that think herself so wise speak so foolish that know well and do ill 

teach i wherein I err 

I will tell thou daughter in that thou know thyself to be belove of so many and settle thy affection only upon one do the mill grind only when the wind sit in one corner or Ship only sail when it be in this or that quarter be he a cunning fencer that lie but at one guard or he a skilful musician that play but on one string be there but one way to the wood and but one bucket that belong to the well to affect one and despise all other become the precise matron not the prostitute the loyal wife not the loose wanton such have I be as you be now and shall learn to sail with all wind defend all blow make music with all string know all the way to the wood and like a good travel hackney learn to drink of all water 

may I miscarry in my Blanda love 
if I that old damnation do not send 
to hell before her time 

I will not have you mother teach i aught 
that tend to injure he 

well look to it when it be late and then repent at leisure as I have do thou se here be nothing but prodigality and pride wanton and waste riot and revel spoil and spend gluttony and gormandize all go to havoc and can this hold out when he have nothing leave to help himself how can he harbour thou look at length to drink from a dry bottle and feed from a empty knapsack look too it it will come to that 

my parsimony shall begin in thou 
and instant for from this hour I vow 
that thou no more shall drink upon my cost 
nor taste the small fragment from my board 
I will see thou starve in the street first 

live to one man a jest thou may aswell tie thyself to one gown and what fool but will change with the fashion yes do confine thyself to one garment and use no variety and see how soon it will rot and turn to rag 

those rag be thy reward o my sweet Blanda 
only for thou I wish my father dead 
and never to rouse we from our sweet delight 
but for this hag this beldame she who back 
have make her item in my mercer book 
who raucous gut I have stuff with delicate 
nay even to surfeit and who freeze blood 
I have warm with aquavitae be this day 
my last of bounty to a wretch ingrate 
but unto thou a new indenture scale 
of a affection fix and permanent 
I will love thou still be it but to give the lie 
to this old canker worm 

nay be not angry 

with thou my soul shall ever be at peace 
but with this love seducer still at war 

hear i but speak 

open but thy lip again it make a way 
to have thy tongue pluck out 

what all in tempest 

yes and the storm raise by that witch spell 
o it be a damn enchantress 

what be the business 

only some few word slip she unaware 
for my sake make her peace 

you charge i deep 
come friend will you be move at woman word 
a man of your know judgement 

have you but hear 
the damn erroneous doctrine that she teach 
you will have judge she to the stake 

but sweet heart 
she now recant those error once more number she 
among your household servant 

shall she beg and be deny aught from you 

come this kiss shall end all former quarrel 

it be not possible 
those lip shall move in vain that two way plead 
both in their speech and silence 

you have prevail 
but upon this condition no way else 
I will censure she as she have sentence thou 
but with some small inversion 

speak how be that 

not too severe I prithee see poor wretch 
she at the bar stand quake 

now hold up 

how man how 

her hand I mean and now I will sentence thou 
accord to thy council give to she 
sail by one wind thou shall to one tune sing 
lie at one guard and play but on one string 
henceforth I will confine thou to one garment 
and that shall be a cast one like thyself 
just past all wear as thou past all use 
and not to be renew till it be as ragged 
as thou be rot 

nay sweet 

that for her habit 

a cold suit I have on it 

to prevent surfeit 
they diet shall I be to one dish confine 
and that too rifle with as unclean hand 
as ere be lay on thou 

what he scant i in victual will he but allow once in drink 

that shall be the refuse of the flagon jaoks 
and snuff such as the nasty breathe shall leave 
of wine and strongwater never hope 
henceforth to smell 

o i I faint already 

if I sink in my state of all the rest 
be thou excuse what thou propose to she 
beldame be now against thyself decree 
drink from dry spring from empty knapsack feed 

no burn wine nor hotwater 

take she hence 

indeed you be too cruel 

yes to she 
only of purpose to be kind to thou 
be any of my guest come 

fear not sir 
you will have a fill table 

what and music 

best consort in the city for fix part 

we shall have song then 

by the ear 

and wench 

yes by the eyc 

ha what be that you say 

we shall have such to bear you company 
as will no doubt content you 

enter then 
in youth there be a fate that sway we still 
to know what be good and yet pursue what be ill 

and what be this Dalavill 

my apprehension 
can give he no more true expression 
then that he first appear a gentleman 
and well condition 

that for outward show 
but what in he have you observe else 
to make he better know 

I have nor eye 
to search into the inward thought of man 
nor ever be study in that art 
to judge of meus affection by the face 
but that which make i best opinion of he 
be that he be companion and the friend 
belove of he who you so much commend 
the noble master Geraldine 

thou have speak 
that which not only crown his true desert 
but now instate he in my better thought 
make his worth unquestioned 

he pretend 
love to my sister Pru I have observe he 
single she out to private conference 

but I can rather for her own sake wish 
young Geraldine will fix his thought that way 
and she towards he in such affinity 
trust i I will not use a spare hand 

but love in these kind shall not be compel 
force nor persuade when it free spring 
and of itself take voluntary root 
it grow it spread it ripen and bring forth 
such a usurious crop of timely fruit 
as crown a plenteous autumn 

such a harvest 
I shall not be the unglad man to see 
of all thy sister friend now whence come you 

who I sir from a lodging of largesse a house of hospitality and a palace of plenty where there be feed like horse and drink like fish where for pint we be serve in pottle and in stead of pottlepot in pail in stead of silvertankard we drink out of watertankard claret run as free as the cock and canary like the conduit of a coronation day where there be nothing but feed and frolic carve in kiss drink and dance music and mad fiddle and feast 

and where I pray thou be all these revel keep 

they may be rather call reek than revel as I come along by the door I be call up among they hegallant and shegallant I no soon look out but see they out with their knife slash of shoulder mangle of leg and launch of loin till there be scarce a whole limb lest among they 

a fearful massacre 

one be hack to cut off a neck this be mangle a breast his knife slip from the shoulder and only cut of a wing one be pick the brain out of a head another be knuckle deep in a belly one be grope for a liver another search for the kidney I see one pluck the sole from the body goose that she be to suffer it another prick into the breast with his one bill woodcock to endure it 

How fall they out at first 

I know not that but it seem one have a stomach and another have a stomach but there be such bite and tear with their tooth that I be sure I see some of their poor carcase pay for it 

do they not send for surgeon 

alas no surgeon help be too late there be no stitch up of those wound where limb be pluck from limb nor any salve for those scar which all the plaster of Paris can cure 

where grow the quarrel first 

it seem it be first broach in the kitchen certain creature be bring in thither by some of the house the cook be a choleric fellow do so touse they and toss they so pluck they and pull they till he leave they as naked as my nail pinion some of they like felon cut the spur from other of their heel then down go he spit some of they he run in at the throat and out at the backside about go his bastingladle where he do so besauce they that many a shrewd turn they have among they 

but in all this how do the woman escape 

they fare best and do the least hurt that I see but for quietness sake be force to swallow what be not yet digest yet every one have their share and she that have least I be sure by this time have her belly full 

and where be all this havoc keep 

marry sir at your next neighbour young master Lionel where there be nothing but drink out of dryfat and health in halftub his guest be feed by the belly and beggar serve at his gate in basket he be the adamant of this age the daffodil of these day the prince of prodigality and the very Caesar of all young citizen 

belike then it be a massacre of meat not as I apprehend 

your gravity have guess aright the chief that fall in this battle be wild fowl and tame fowl pheasant be wound in stead of Alfaresse and capon for captain anchovy stand for ancient and caviar for corporal dish be assault in stead of ditch and rabbit be cut to piece upon the rebel some lose their leg while other of their wing be force to fly the pioneer undermine nothing but piecrust and 

enough enough your wit have play too long upon our patience 
wife it grieve i much both for the young and old man the one 
grace his head with care endure the parch heat and bite cold 
the terror of the land and fear at sea in travel only to gain 
some competent estate to leave his son 
while all that merchandise through gulf crosstide 
pirate and storm he bring so far the other 
here shipwreck in the harbour 

it be the care of father and the weakness 
incident to youth that want experience 

I be at the begin of the battle 
but here come some that it seem 
be at the rifle of the dead carcase 
for by their mirth they have have part of the spoil 

you be pleasant gentleman what I entreat 
may be the subject of your pleasant sport 
it promise some pleasure 

if their recreation 
be as I make no question on truth ground 
it will beget sudden laughter 

what be the project 

who shall relate it 

master Geraldine if there be any thing can please my ear 
with pleasant sound your tongue must be the instrument 
on which the string must strike 

be it he then 

nay hear it it be a good one 

we entreat you possess we of the novel 

speak good sir 

I shall then with a kind of barbarism 
shadow a jest that ask a smooth tongue 
for in my poor discourse I do protest 
it will but lose his luster 

you be modest 

however speak I pray for my sake do it 

this be like a hasty pudding long in eat then it be in make 

then thus it be this gentleman and I 
pass but just now by your next neighbour house 
where as they say dwell one young Lionel 

where I be tonight at supper 

a unthrift youth his father now at sea 

why that be they very subject upon which 
it seem this jest be ground there this night 
be a great feast 

why so I tell you sir 

be thou still dumb it be he that I will hear 

in the height of their carouse all their brain 
warm with the heat of wine discourse be offer 
of ship and storm at sea when sudden 
out of his giddy wildness one conceive 
the room wherein they quaff to be a pinnace 
move and float and the confuse noise 
to be the murmur wind gust mariner 
that their unsteadfast foot do proceed 
from rock of the vessel this conceive 
each one begin to apprehend the danger 
and to look out for safety fly say one 
up to the mantop and discoverer he 
climb by the bed post to the taster there 
report a turbulent sea and tempest towards 
and will they if they will save their ship and line 
to cast their lade overboard at this 
all fall to work and hoist into the street 
as to the sea what next come to their hand 
stool table trestle trencher bedstead cup 
pot plate and glass here a fellow whistle 
they take he for the boatswain one lie struggle 
upon the floor as if he swim for life 
a three take the bassviol for the cockboat 
sit in the belly on it labour and row 
his oar the stick with which the fiddler play 
a four bestride his fellow think to escape 
as do Arion on the dolphin back 
still fumble on a gittern 

excellent sport 

but what be the conclusion 

the rude multitude 
watch without and gape for the spoil 
cast from the window go by the ear about it 
the constable be call to atone the broil 
which do and hear such a noise within 
of eminent shipwreck enter the house and find they 
in this confusion they adore his staff 
and think it Neptune trident and that he 
come with his Triton so they call his watch 
to calm the tempest and appease the wave 
and at this point we leave they 

Come what will I will steal out of door 
and see the end of it that be certain 

thank master Geraldine for this discourse 
introth it have much please i but the night 
begin to grow fast on we for your part 
you be all young and you may sit up late 
my eye begin to summon I to sleep 
and nothing more offensive unto age 
then to watch long and late

or be there one a much worse character 

and she no less who either beauty youth 
time place or opportunity can tempt

when with much loud accent of his praise 
so all the world report he 

thank my star

How mean you that 

so beautiful a mistress 

a mistress say you 

yes sir or a friend 
whether you please to style she 

mistress friend 
pray be more open language 

and indeed 
who can blame he to absent himself from home 
and make his father house but as a grange 
for a beauty so attractive or blame she 
hug so weak a old man in her arm 
to make a new choice of a equal youth 
be in he so perfect yet introth 
I think they both be honest 

you have sir 
possess i with such strange fancy 

for my part 
how can I love the person of your son 
and not his reputation his repair 
so often to the house be voice by all 
and frequent in the mouth of the whole country 
some equal addict praise his happiness 
but other more censorious and austere 
blame and reprove a course so dissolute 
each one in general pity the good man 
as one unfriendly deal with yet in my conscience 
I think they true honest 

it be suspicious 

true sir at best but what when scandalous tongue 
will make the worst and what good in itself 
sully and stain by fabulous misreport 
for let man live as chary as they can 
their life be often question then no wonder 
if such as give occasion of suspicion 
be subject to this scandal what I speak 
be as a noble friend unto your son 
and therefore as I glory in his fame 
I suffer in his wrong for as I live 
I think they both be honest 

howsoever I wish they so 

some course may be devise 
to stop this clamour ere it grow too rank 
lest that which yet but inconvenience seem 
may turn to great mischief this I speak 
in zeal to both in sovereign care of he 
as of a friend and tender of her honour 
as one to who I hope to be ally 
by marriage with her sister 

I much thank you 
for you have clear give i light of that 
till now I never dream on

play little better than the thief with you 
for they have rob your garden

to wear in public view 

beside these can 
be miss out of so many in full field 
the glean be allow 

these and the rest 
be lady at your service 

now to horse 
but one thing ere we part I must entreat 
in which my wife will be joint suitor with i 
my sister too 

in what I pray 

that he 
which bring we hither may but bring we home 
your much respect son 

how man be bear 
to woe their own disaster 

but to see we 
from whence he bring we sir that be all 

this second motion make it palpable 
to note a woman cunning make her husband 
bawd to her own lascivious appetite 
and to solicit his own shame 

nay sir 
when all of we join in so small a suit 
it be some injury to be deny 

and work her sister too what will not woman 
to accomplish she own end but this disease 
I will seek to physic ere it grow too far 
I be most sorry to be urge sweet friend 
in what at this time I can no way grant 
most that these lady shall be aught deny 
to who I owe all service but occasion 
of weighty and important consequence 
such as concern the best of my estate 
call he aside excuse we both this once 
presume this business be no soon over 
but he be at his own freedom 

it be not manner 
in we to urge it further we will leave you 
with promise sir that he shall in my will 
not be the last remember 

we be bind to you 
see they to horse and instant return 
we have employment for you 

sir I shall 

Remember your last promise 

not to do it I shall forget myself 
if I find he false 
to such a friend be sure he forfeit i 
in which to be more punctual resolve 
I have a project how to five his foul 
how it be incline whether to yonder place 
the clear bright palace or black dungeon see 
they be onward on the way and he return 

I now attend your pleasure 

you be grow perfect man and now you float 
like to a well build vessel between two current 
virtue and vice take this you steer to harbour 
take that to eminent shipwreck 

pray your meaning 

what father care be you shall never know 
till you yourself have child now my study 
be how to make you such that you in they 
may have a feel of my love to you 

pray sir expound yourself for I protest 
of all the language I yet have learn 
this be to i most foreign 

then I shall 
I have live to see you in your prime of youth 
and height of fortune so you will but take 
occasion by the forehead to be brief 
and cut off all superfluous circumstance 
all the ambition that I aim at now 
be but to see you marry 

marry sir 

and to that purpose I have find out one 
who youth and beauty may not only please 
a curious eye but her immediate mean 
able to strengthen a state competent 
or raise a ruine fortune 

of all which 
I have believe i neither need nor use 
my competence best please as it be 
and this my singularity of life 
most to my mind content 

I suspect but yet must prove he further 
say to my care I add a father charge 
and couple with my counsel my command 
to that how can you answer 

that I hope 
my duty and obedience still unblamed 
do never merit such austerity 
and from a father never yet displease 

nay than to come more near unto the point 
either you must resolve for present marriage 
or forfeit all your interest in my love 

unsay that language I entreat you sir 
and do not so oppress i or if needs 
your heavy imposition stand in force 
resolve i by your counsel with more safety 
may I infringe a sacred vow to heaven 
or to oppose i to your strict command 
since one of these I must 

now Dalavill 
I find thy word too true 

for marry sir I neither may nor can 

yet whore you may 
and that be no breach of any vow to heaven 
pollute the nuptial bed with michall sin 
asperse the honour of a noble friend 
forfeit thy reputation here below 
and the interest that thy soul may claim above 
in you bless city these you may and can 
with untouched conscience o that I shall live 
to see the hope that I have store so long 
thus in a moment ruine and the staff 
on which my old decrepit age shall lean 
before my face thus break on which trust 
I thus abortive before my time 
fall headlong to my grave 

it yet stand strong 
both to support you unto future life 
and fair comfort 

never never son 
for till thou can acquit thyself of scandal 
and i of my suspicion here even here 
where I have measure out my length of earth 
I shall expire my last 

both these I can 
then rise sir I entreat you and that innocency 
which poison by the breath of calumny cast you thus low 
shall these few stain wipe off with better thought erect you 

well say on 

there be but one fire from which this smoke may grow 
namely the unmatched yoke of youth and 
in which if ever I occasion be 
of the small breach the great implacable mischief 
adultery can threaten fall on i 
of you may I be disavow a son 
and unto heaven a servant for that lady 
as she be beauty mirror so I hold she 
for chastity example from her tongue 
never come language that arrive my ear 
that even censorious Cato live he now 
can misinterpret never from her lip 
come unchaste kiss or from her constant eye 
look savour of the least immodesty further 

enough one only thing remain which on thy part perform assure firm credit to these thy protestation 

name it then 

take hence the occasion of this common fame 
which have already spread itself so far 
to her dishonour and thy prejudice from this day forward

Even as free 
as you forget my quarrel make with you 
raise from the error first beget by he 
I here remit all free I now be calm

have only purpose to deprive a father 
of a love son and many noble friend 
of your much wish acquaintance 

o dear sir

of your free grant which with such care and study 
I have so long so often labour for

why you desire to steal out of your country 
like some malefactor that have forfeit 
his life and freedom here be a worthy gentleman 
have for your sake invite many guest 
to his great charge only to take of you 
a part leave you send he word you can 
after you may not come have not my urgence 
almost compulsion drive you to his house 
the unkindness may have forfeit your love 
and raze you from his will in which he have give you 
a fair and large estate yet you of all this strangeness 
show no sufficient ground 

then understand 
the ground thereof take his first birth from you 
it be you first charge i to forbear the house 
and that upon your blessing let it not then 
offend you sir if I so great a charge 
have strive to keep so strict 

i perhaps 
you may appease and with small difficulty 
because a father but how satisfy 
their dear and on your part unmerited love 
but this your last obedience may salve all 
we now grow near the house 

who door to i 
appear as horrid as the gate of hell 
where shall I borrow patience or from whence 
to give a meeting to this viperous brood 
of friend and mistress 

you have entertain i with a strange discourse 
of your man knavish wit but I rejoice 
that in your safe return all end so well 
most welcome you and you and indeed all 
to who I be bind that at so short a warning 
thus friendly you will deign to visit i 

it seem my absence have beget some sport

but though their riot trip at my estate 
they have not quite overthrow it 

but see gentleman these who we most expect come at length this I proclaim the master of the feast 
in which to express the bounty of my love 
I will show myself no niggard

or least regard though in a seem show 
she court a reply betwixt he and she

if she have brain to apprehend as much 
as I have do she will quick find it out 
now as I live as our affection meet

to some such purpose I will retire myself 
not interrupt their conference 

you be sad sir 

I know no cause

who can be otherways to leave a father 
so careful and each way so provident 
to leave so many and such worthy friend 
to abandon your own country these be some 
nor do I think you can be much the merry 
for my sake 

now your tongue speak oracle 
for all the rest be nothing it be for you 
only for you I can 

so I think 
why then have you be all this while so strange 
why will you travel sue a divorce 
betwixt we of a love inseparable 
for here shall I be leave as desolate 
unto a freeze almost widow bed 
warm only in that future store in you 
for who can in your absence comfort i
