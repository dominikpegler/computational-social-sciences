








SIgnior, Don Carlos is without.



Wait on him in.





Cozin, to me this day hath longer seem'd than usual,
Since 'tis so far advanc'd without our seeing one another.



Me thinks so too; but you repair your Stay,
By coming hither opportunely now;
You have so often born with my Distempers,
'Tis fit that once at least you should partake
Of my Good humour.



What ere the Cause may be (I'm sure) I joy
In the Effect, and may it long continue.



I can inform you by experience now,
How great a satisfaction 'tis to find
A Heart and Head eas'd of a weighty care;
For a Gentleman of my warm temper,
Jealous of the Honour of his Family,
(Yet never blemish'd) to be fairly freed
From the Tuition of an Orphan Sister,
Rich, Beautiful, and Young.



You know, Don Henrique, that for divers years,
Your Friend has been with the like Province charg'd,
A tender Sister, by our Parents will,
(When they were call'd from all their Cares below)


To mine committed; and though more expos'd
Still to the world than yours; and (Sir) unless
Nearness of blood deceive me, short of few
In the advantages that draw Pretenders;
Yet thanks to my Temper, Cozin, as well
As to her Virtue, I have seen her grow
Up from her Childhood, to her Dangerous Age,
Without the least Disturbance to my rest:
And when with equal Justice I reflect
On the great Modesty and Circumspection
Of lovely Porcia, I conclude, that you
Might well have slept as Undisturb'd as I.



Sir, I complain not of my Sisters conduct;
But you know well, young Maids are so expos'd
To the Invasion of audacious men,
And to the Malice of their envious Sex,
You must confess the Confines of their Fame
Are never safe till guarded by a Husband;
The wisdom of Relations ought to use
Preventions of all sorts; but dear Carlos,

The Blemish once received, no Wash is good
For stains of Honor, but th'Offenders blood.



Y' are too severe a Judge of point of Honor.



And therefore having not long since receiv'd
The news, that Don Antonio Pimentel,

Is likely to be here this night from Flanders;

To whom my Sister by Velladas means,
(Our common Friend and Patron) is contracted;
I will not close these eyes till I have seen
Her, and my Cares, safe lodg'd within his arms.



I find you travels, Cozin, have not cur'd you
Of that innate Severity to Women,
Which grows to be a National reproach
Unto us all abroad; the world laments
That miserable Sex amongst us here,
Born onely to be honorable Prisoners;
The more of Quality, the Closer kept;
Which Cruelty is reveng'd upon our selves,
Whilst by Immuring those whom most we Love,
We sing and sigh onely to Iron Grates.
As cruel is that over-cautious use,
By Proxy to contract Parties Unknown
To one another; this is onely fit
For Soveraign Princes, whose high qualities
Will not allow of previous interviews;

They sacrifise▪ their Love to Publick good,
Consulting onely Interest and Blood.

A custom, which as yet I never know


Us'd between persons of a Lower rank,
Without a sequel of sad Consequence:
Sir, understand me right; I speak not this
By way of Prophecy; I am no stranger
To Don Antonios great reputation,
Which I believe so just, I no way doubt
Your Sisters being happy in him.




Don Carlos, let us quit this Argument;
I now am going to our noble friend
And kinsman the Corigidor, to see
If he will honor with his Company
My Sisters Wedding; will you come along?



Most willingly; as soon as I have brought
My Sister hither, and left her with yours.



I have some business, Cozin, by the way,
I'l go before,* and wait you i'th'*Piazza.




This Kinsman is my bosom friend, and yet
Of all men living, I must hide from him
My deep resentments of his Sisters scorn;
That cruel Maid, to wound me to the Heart,
Then close her Ears against my just complaints;
But though as yet I cannot heal my wound,
I may, by my Revenge upon my Rival
Divert the Pain; and I will drive it home;
There's in Revenged a Balm, which will appease
The present grief, and Time cure the disease.







My heart is so opprest, with fear and grief,
That it must break, unless it find relief;
The Man I love is forc'd to flie my sight,
And like a Parthian, kills me in his flight:
One whom I never saw, I must embrace,
Or else destroy the honour of my race.
A Brothers Care, more cruel than his Hate;
O how perplext is my unhappy fate!





Cozin, I thought my Sisters company
Would not displease you, whilst I wait upon
Your Brother in visit.



Sir, you oblige me with a welcom favour;
aside.
I rather should have stil'd it Charity,
To bring a friend to her, whose cruel fate
Has robb'd her of her self.



Me thinks, 'tis pitty that a wall should make
The houses two, of friends so entirely one,
As you, and I, and our two Brothers are.



If it be true, that Lovers live much more,
There where they Love, than where they Breath, I'm sure
No walls can sever us, w' are still together.



Were I not much engag'd, I would not quit
So sweet a Conversation; but, Sister,
At my return, I'l wait upon you home.



For this night, Cozin, pray let her be mine,
I beg it of you both.



You may command, we are both yours.






Porcia throws her self on ca∣millas
neck
how I long'd to have thee,
Where freely breathing out my Grief, I might
Some mitigation from thy Pitty find;

But since there's no true Pitty without Pain;

Why should I Ease, by thy Affliction gain?



Ah Porcia! if Compassion Suffering be,
And to Condole be Pain; my Destiny
Will full revenge in the same kind afford;
Should I, but my unequal'd griefs relate,
And you, but equally participate.



If yours, as mine, from Love-disasters rise,
Our Fates are more alli'd than Families.



What, to our Sex, and blooming age can prove
An anguish worthy of our Sighs, but Love?



'Tis true, Camilla, were your fate like mine,
Hopeless to hold, unable to resign.



Let's tell our Stories, then we soon shall see,
Which of us two excells in Misery.







Do you begin then.



You know, After a lit∣tle pause.
Camilla, best, how generously,
How long, and how discreetly, my Octavio

Hath serv'd me; and what trials of his faith
And fervour I did make, ere I allow'd
The least hope to sustain his noble Love.
Cozin, all this you know; 'twas in your House
We had our interviews; where you were pleas'd
To suffer feign'd addresses to your Self,
To cover from my watchful Brother's eyes,
The real passion which he had for me.



My memory in this needs no refreshing.



And how one Evening (O that fatal hour)
My Brother passing by Don Carlos house,
With his great Friend and Confident Don Pedro,

Did chance to see th' unfortunate Octavio,



At your Balcony, entertaining me,
Whom not believing there, he took for you;
Where mad with Jealousie, his cruel nature
(To which all Moderation is unknown)
Resolves to stamp all your Neglects of him,
In's suppos'd Rival poor Octavio's heart;
He, and his Friend both draw, Octavio

Retires, they assault him, who in's own defence
Does kill Don Pedro, and is forc'd to flie.
My Brother cruelly pursues him still,
With such insatiate thirst after revenge,
That nothing but Octavio's blood can quench;
Yet covering still his Rage and Jealousie,
With the resentment of Don Pedro's death.



Is this the sum of your sad story, Porcia?
Is this all?



No, no, Camilla, 'tis the Prologue onely,
The Tragedy does follow; this Tyrant,
This cruel Brother, to th'Impetuous Laws
Of whose Tuition, our deceased Parents
My Person and my Fortune have condemn'd,
In his unjust Suspition restless grown,
(Which he to palliate Vice with Virtues name,
Does Sense of Honor call) takes an Allarm,
And starts at every shadow; as if reproach
Attended all the actions of a Sister,
Though ne'r so Circumspect; and uses me,
As if the Honor of our Family
Were over-thrown for ever▪ should my Eyes,
Or Judgment, be but the least part allow'd
In making choice of him should be my Husband.
Therefore to frustrate all my hopes at once,
He has already marri'd me by Proxie,
To one in Flanders, whom I never saw,
Who is this very night expected here.



Is such a rigour possible, dear Porcia?




Was ever Miserie like mine, Camilla?

Heightned to such extremes, past all relief?
If I acquaint my Brother with my Love
T' Octavio, the man he most does Hate,
I must expect the worst effects of fury;
If I endeavour to Forget Octavio,

Even that attempt renews his memory,
And fresh Disquiet gives; If I refuse
To marry, I am lost; If I obey,
I cast Octavio and my self away.
Two such Extremes of ill, no Choice admit,
Each seems the Worst; on which Rock shall I split?


Since if I marry, I cannot survive;
And not to marry; were to die alive.



Your Story (I confess) is strangely moving;
Yet if you could my Fortune weigh with yours,
In Scales of equal Sensibility,
You would not change your Sufferings, for mine.



What can there be in Nature more afflicting,
Than a Divorce from th'Object of our Love,
For ever, to embrace the thing we Hate?



Have you not known that Object of your Love?
And entertain'd the Person you esteem?
Have you not heard, and answered to his Sighs?
Has he not born his Part in all your Cares?
Do not you live, and reign within his heart?



I doubt no more his Faith, that my hard Fate.



But tell me, dearest Porcia, if I love
One, I ne'r shall see, and suffer as much
Without the Means of e'r expressing it,
As what I suffer is above expression;
If all my Sighs wander in fleeting Air,
And ne'r can reach his ears for whom they're form'd;
If all my Passion, all my killing Cares,
Must be for ever▪ to their Cause unknown;
If that their weight must sink me to my Grave,
Without one Groan that he can ever hear,
Or the least hope, that I should e'r obtain
By Pitty Ease, or Cure by his Disdain:
If this the state of my Misfortune be,
Say, dearest Porcia, do you envie me?



What over-cruel Laws of Decency
Have struck you dumb? have you misplac'd your Love,
On such a Subject, as you dare not own?



No, the Cause is worthy of the Effect;
And though I had no Passion for his Person,
I were Ungrateful if I should not give
The first place in my Heart to such high Merit.



If he has been so Generous, to deserve
Your Love, why are not you so Just, to let
Him know it?



'Tis impossible; Ah! that dismal word
Does full state the Difference of our Fortunes:
You, in your first Adventure have been crost,
But I, before I can set out am lost.



Pray make me comprehend this Mystery.



'Tis t' open my wounds afresh, dear Porcia,After a lit∣tle pause.

But You must be obey'd 
The Conde de Onniate being sent

Embassadour unto the Emperour;

We having th' honor to be near ally'd


To him, by his Lady, (who likewise went
That Journey with her Husband) my Brother
Was desir'd by her to make that Voiage;
Whose tenderness for me, nor suffering him
To let me stay behind, I was ingag'd;
And treated by th' Ambassadress, my Cozin,
With more respect than I could ever merit.



She's a Lady, fam'd for great Civility.



We had not pass'd much time i'th, Emp'ror'S Corut,
When my dear Brother unexpectedly,
By urgent business, was call'd back to Sevil;

And in our return (too near a Garison
Of th'Enemies) our Convoy was surpriz'd,
And routed by a Party of their Horse.




Camilla, you begin to raise my fears.



We Prisoners made, were hurri'd streight away
To their Quarters, where my malicious Fate
Made me appear too pleasing to the Eyes
Of their Commander; who at first approach
Pretends to Parly in a Lovers style,
Protesting that my Face had chang'd our Fortunes,
And him my Captive made: But finding soon
How little he advanc'd in his Design
By Flattery, and his feign'd Submission;
He shifts his Person, calls me his Prisoner,
And swears my Virgin-Treasure was his Prize;
And yet protests he had much rather owe it
To my Indulgence, than his own Good Fortune;
And so through Storms and Calms, the Villain still
Pursues his Course to his accursed End;
But finding me inflexible to Threats
As well as Fawnings, he resolves to use
The last, and uncontroled Argument
Of Impious Men in Power, Force.



Ah poor Camilla! tell me, where was then
Your Brother, at a time of such distress?



My Brother? he, alas, was long before
Born away from me, in the first Incounter;
Where having certainly behav'd himself
As did become his Nation and his Name,
Remain'd sore wounded in another House.



Pr'ythee make haste to free me from this fright.



The Brute approaches; and by Violence
Endeavours to accomplish his intent;
I Heaven invoke, and strong Resistance make,
But with Unequal force, though Rage suppli'd
Those Spirits, which my Fear had put to flight;
Breathless at length with crying out, and striving,


I spi'd a Dagger by the Villain's side,
Which snatching boldly out, as my last refuge,
With his own Arms I wound the Savage Beast;
He, at the stroke, unseas'd me, and gave back;
( So Guilt produces Cowardice) then I
The Dagger pointing to my breast, cri'd out,
Villain, keep off, for if thou dost persist,
I'l be my self both Sacrifise and Priest;
I boldly now defie thy Lust, and Hate;

She that dares Choose to die, may Brave her Fate.

Immediately the Drums and Trumpets sound,
Pistols go off, and a great cry, To Arms,
To Arms: The Lustful Satyr flies; I stand
Fix'd with amazement to the Marble floor,
Holding my Guardian Dagger up aloft,
As if the Ravisher had threatned still.



I fancy thee, Camilla, in that brave posture,
Like a noble Statue, which I remember
To have seen, of the inraged Juno,

VVhen she had robb'd Jove of his Thunderbolt.



Freed from this Fright, my Spirits flow so fast
To the forsaken Chanels of my Heart,
That those who by their orderly access
Would have Supported life, by Throngs oppress.
O're-charg'd with Joy, I fell into a Swoon;
And what was done in this Parenihesis

Is not within the Circle of my Knowledge.



Y' have rais'd me to a mighty Expectation;
VVill the Adventure answer it, Camilla?




At my return to life, op'ning my eyes,
Think, dearest Porcia, how I was astonish'd,
To find there kneeling by my side, a Man,
Of a most noble Form, who bowing to me,

Madam, (says he) y'are welcome to the world;
Pardon, I pray, the Boldness of a Stranger,
That humbly sues t'you to Continue in it;
Or if You needs will Leave us, stay at least
Till I shall have Reveng'd your wrongs, and then
I'l wait upon you to the other world,
For You with-drawn, this will a Desert seem,
And Life a Torment.



High gallantry, Cozin, for a first Address.



'Twas so Surprizing, that my Confusion
Check'd my Reply: but I suppose my Looks
Did speak the grateful Language of my Heart;
For I perceiv'd an Air of Joy enlighten
His manly Face; out, O! it soon was clowded,
By fresh Allarms; We heard the Soldiers cry,


Where's Antonio, th'Enemy is ralli'd,
And coming on to give Second Charge;
He started up, and with a Meen, that mark'd
The Conflict 'twixt his Honor and his Love;

Madam, (says he) the Soul was never yet
With such Convulsion from the Body torn,
As I from you; but it must ne'r be said,
That Don Antonio Pimentel was seen
To Follow in Dangers those he ought to Lead;
And thus the Vanquish'd Conqueror Disappear'd,
Leaving that Image stamp'd upon my Heart,
To which I all the Joys must Sacrifice
Of the poor remnant of my wretched Life;
If properly to live I may be said, She puts her Handker∣chief to her Eyes.

When all my hopes of Seeing him are dead.



What said you was his name, Camilla?




Don Antonio Pimentel, I told you.




O Heavens! Antonio Pimentel?






I'm pleas'd to find you Speaking of your Husband.



What's that I hear?Aside. her Husband?



Have you the Letter ready, I desir'd you
To write to him? I'l send a Servant with it,
To meet him on the way, 'twill shew Respect.



You know my Obedience, Brother.









Sir, here's a Servant of Don Antonio,

Newly alighted at the Gate; he's come
Post from his Master, charg'd with Letters for You.



You ne'r could bRing me a more welcom News;
Call him in, Sylvio: Sister, you may
With-draw, and take this time to ask your Cozin,
How she likes my Choice of your Wedding-Cloathes.



My Wedding-Cloathes? Ah! miserable Maid!
The Heathen so to their Feign'd Deities
AdoRn'd the Victims they did Sacrifice.








Signior, Don Antonio kisses your hands,
And sends me to present this Letter to you.


Don Henrique opens it, and seeming to have
read it to himself, says,


I'm glad you left him well; but yet me thinks,
He writes doubtfully of his being here
This night, as I expected.



His Letter, I suppose, declares his purpose.



I'l answer't, and dispatch you presently.
In the mean while go make him welcom, Sylvio.



and Henrique at the other.





Meethinks, Camerade, a soop of Chocolate

Is not amiss after a tedious Journey;
Your Master's Health, He drinks. Sir.



I'l do you reason, Sir.



Pray how long is't, Brother, since you left Spain?




'Tis now five years, and upward, since I went
From Sevil, with my Master, into Flanders,

The King's Fencing-School; where all his Subjects,
Given to Fighting, are taught the Use of Arms,
And notably kept in breath.



Your Master, I am sure, has got the Fame
To be a Per'lous man in that rough Trade.



He's a brave Soldier, Envy must confess it.



If seems so i'faith, since meerly by the force
Of his great Reputation, he can take our Bright
Young Mistris so, without a Siege.



I hope she'l be Reveng'd on him ere long,
And take him too, by the force of her Wit,
And Beautie.



S'has more than a Child's Portion, Sir, of both,
I dare assure you.



But, pr'ythee, Brother, instruct me a little,
Tell me, what kind of Country is this Holland,

That's so much talk'd of, and so much fought for.



Why, Friend, 'tis a huge Ship at Anchor, fraught
With a sort of Creatures, made up of Turf,
And Butter.



I pray, Sir, what do they drink in that Country?
'Tis said, there's neither Fountains there,
Nor Vines.



This is the B•tler sure by his apt question. Aside.

Friend, they drink there a certain muddy Liquor,
Made of that Grain with which you feed your Mules.



What? Barley? can that Liquor quench their thirst?



You'd scarce believe it did, had you but seen
How oft they drink.



But, me-thinks, that should make them drunk, Camera•




Indeed most Strangers do think so, but they
Themselves believe it not, because they're so,
So often.



A Nation sure of Walking Tuns; the World
Has not the like.



Pardon me, Friend, there is but a great Ditch
Butwixt them and such another Nation;
If these Good-fellows would but Joyn, and drink
That drie, i'faith they might shake hands.



Pr'ythee, Friend, can these Dutch Borraccios
Fight?



They can do even as well, for they can Pay
Those that can fight.



But where, I pr'ythee, do they get their Money?



Oh, Friend, they have a Thriving Mystery;
They Cheat their Neighbouring Princes of their Trade,
And then they Buy their Subjects for their Soldiers.



Me-thinks our Armies should beat these Dull Fellows
Out of the World.



These Dull Fellows will sooner beat our Armies
Out of their Country; Why, Friend, ready Mony
Will do much more, in Camps, as well as Courts,
Than a Ready Wit, I dare assure you.



What a Gods name could come into the Heads
Of this People, to make them Rebell?



Why Religion, that came into their Heads
A Gods name.



But what a Devil made the Noble-men
Rebel?



Why that which made the Devil himself Rebel,
Ambition.



This is a pleasant Fellow; Aside.

I find that you Soldiers do not want Wit.



But I find he wants Wit that is a Soldier.
Gentlemen, your Company's very good,
But I have business that requires Dispatch.



Will you not mend your Draught before you go?



I thank you, Sir, I have done very well.






Was e'r Misfortune like to mine, Camilla?




Was e'r Disaster, P•rcia, like to mine?



That I must never see Octavio more.



That I again must Don Antonio see,
Never to see him Mine.



I, to be marri'd to the Man I HaTe.



And I, to have the Man I Love, torn from me.



I am, by Robbing of my Friend, undone.



And I (alas) by Yielding, ruine both.



Ye Powers, who these intangled fortunes give,
Instruct us how to Die,* or how to Live.



Cozin, when we should Act, then to Complain,
Is Childishly to beat the Air in vain.
The sedescants on our Griefs do but Perplex,
Let's seek the Remedy; You know, our Sex
This Honor beats from Men, in Exigents
Of Love, never to want Expedients.



You have awaken'd me, give me your Veil,
Quickly, my Dearest, quickly; and You, Flora,

Run and see if my Brother be setled
To the Dispatching of Antonio's Man.*






What mean you, Porcia?




If once my Brother be set down to write,
I may securely reckon one hour mine;
His Wits are onely in his Choler quick
And his Hand ready in Revenge; he's so
Extravagantly Jealous, he distrusts
The Meaning of his own ill-chosen Words,
And so at length can hardly fix on any.
This Time I will make use of to go see

Octavio, and let him know that the last Term
Of all our Hopes is ready to Expire,
Unless his VVit, his Courage, and his Love,
Some quick Expedient find for our Relief.



Why, How, and VVhere d'you hope to speak with him?



In his own House, where he does lie conceal'd,
'Tis not far off, and I will venture thither.



Know you the way?



Not very well, but Flora's a good Guide.




O Madam! he's coming already.



Ah spiteful Destiny! let us retire,
Corin, into my Chamber.






If you desire to speak with her, you may.



I should be very glad to tell my Master
That I have had th' Honour to see his Bride.








She's in her Chamber, Signior.




Tell her, 〈…〉 does desire


To do his Duty to her, ere he goes.


Friend, you will find her there, without a Veil,
In her Home Dress, but you are privileg'd
For this free Access, by your Relation.
Whilst you wait on her, I'l go end my Letter.







If thou lov'st me, get him quickly away,
Before my Brother come,* and give him this.


Ernesto addresses himself to Camilla,
seeing her without a Veil.



Madam, I have been bold to beg the Honor
Of Seeing you, to make my self more welcome
To my Lord, at my return.



A rare Mistake,* further it, dear Camilla.

Who knows what Good this Error may produce?



Friend, in what state left you your Lord and mine?



As happy as the Hopes of being Yours
Ought certainly to make him, Madam.




I would the Master were as easily deceiv'd.*

I pray present my Humble Service to him:

Flora, give him the Letter; Farewel.





Now by my Life, she is a lovely Lady;
My Master will be ravish'd with her Form;
I hope the Bargain, which her Brother made,
By th' interposal of Vellada's Power,
(Though founded onely in Interest) may prove
As happy a Marriage, as any other
Made after th'old fashion, chiefly for Love;
And that so rare a Beauty may have power
To bring him back to his right Wits again
From his wild Ravings on an unknown Dame,

Whom as he fancies (once upon a time)
He recover'd from a Trance, that is,
From a sound Sleep, to make him Dreame'r since.
I'l hasten to him with this pleasing news.







My Melancholy could hardly hinder me
From laughing at the Formal Fools mistake;
But tell me, did not I present your Per••age
With assurance? the way for both to thrive,
Is to make me your Representative,*




Most willingly, and I am confident,
When you, your Charms shall to his heart apply,
You all your Rivals safely may defie.



I wish I could be vain enough to hope it.
But, Cozin, my Despairs are so Extreme,


I can't be flatter'd, though but in a Dream.




Madam, do we go, or what d' you resolve on?



I must resolve, I see, yet know not what.



Cozin, take heed, I am afraid you venture
Too much, your Brother cannot tarry long;
And, if returning, he should find you missing 



Y'have reason, the opportunity is lost,
What is't a Clock, Flora?




I think near Eight, for the Clock struck seven,
Just as Camilla enter'd the Chamber.



Quick then, Flora, fetch your Veil, you shall carry
My Tablets to Octavio, there he'l find
The Hour and Place where I would have him meet.





'Tis well resolv'd; but where do you design
Your Meeting?



In the Remotest part of all the Garden,
Which answers (as you know) to my apartment;
And Flora has the Key of the Back-door.



As the Case stands, you choose the fittest place.





Cozin, I beg your patience whilst I write.



You,*Flora, by this Accident may chance
To see your faithful Lover Diego.




He is a faithful Lover of himself,
Without a Rival, Madam.





Damsel, your Words and Thoughts do not agree;
For could we see his Image in your Heart,
'Twould be a fairer far, than ere his Glass
Reflected.




Madam, I am not yet so very Old,
That I should Dote.



Nor yet so very Young, but you may Love.
Dotage and Love are Cozin-germans, Flora.




Yes,* when we Love, and are not lov'd again;
For else, I think, they're not so near a kin.



I've tou•h'd a Nettle,* and have stung my self.



Make haste,* dear Flora







Should I not play my part, I were to blame,
Since all my Fortune's betted on her game.

Madam, has Octavio the other Key
Belonging to the Tablets.





Yes, yes, I pray make haste.
Let us retire, Camilla a little Rest,
And Meditation, may new aids suggest.



The City of SEVIL.





SIr, we are arriv'd in very good time.



I did not think it would have been so soon,
By an hour at least, but Lovers ride apace.
Why smile you, Sancho?




Faith at the Novelty of your Amours,
To fall in Love with one, you Scarcely saw,
And marry one, you Never saw; 'tis pretty;
But we poor Mortals have another Method.



Y'are very pleasant; this, Sancho, is the place,
VVhere I charg'd Ernesto to expect me,
VVhom I sent before to my Brother-in-Law;
But with this Order, not to let him know,
That I intended to arrive this Evening:
Surprizes in Love-meetings render Men
More welcome, and have more of Gallantry.



Since you are here, Sir, earlier than you thought;
VVhy might you not go shift you at the Post-house?
And be back here, before Ernesto come,
Howe're, 'tis better, that he wait for you,
Than you for him i'th' open Street.



'Tis well thought on; come, let's to the Post-house.






Come, Diego, tis time to quit our Lurking-holes,
And to begin our Chase:



Of what, Sir? Bats, or Owls, now the Sun's set?
Call you this making of Love? me-thinks, 'tis
More like making of VVar; marching all night
In Arms, as if we design'd to Beat up
The Enemies Quarters.



VVhy would'st not thou venture as much for Flora?




No in good faith; shall venture enough
If e'r I Marry her; I'l run no hazard,
(By my good-will) before hand.



That's from your Fear, not Prudence, Diego.




Sir, you may call it what you please, but I


Dare boldly say, there lives not in the world
A more Valiant Man, than I, whilst Danger
Does keep its Distance; but when sawcily
It presses on, then (I confess) 'tis true,
I have a certain Tenderness for Life,
That checks my Ardor, and enclines my Prudence
Timely to withdraw.



Your Style is wondrous civil to your self;
How you Soften that harsh word, call'd Cowardice;
But the Danger is not always evident,
VVhen you are pleas'd, my Friend, to Run away.



It may be so, Sir, not to Vulgar eyes;
But I have such a peircing sight, that can
Discover Perils out of others Ken;
VVhich, they not seeing soon enough to Shun,
Are forc'd t'Encounter; and then their strugling
Is, by th'unwarie world, taken for Courage.



You have more Light, Diego, I see, than Heat;
But I'l allow your VVit and Honesty
To come to Composition for your want
Of Courage; though it be a Quality
I may have use of; but we lose our time.
VVas ever Lover's Fare so rude as mine?
Condemn'd to Darkness, forc'd to hide my Head,
As well as Love? and to do me a Spight,
Fortune has Contradictions reconcil'd,
I am at once a Prisoner, and Exil'd.





Me-thinks, Ernesto should not tarry long,
If not already come; Sancho, how call you
The 〈◊〉 there just before us? where you see
You Gentleman with his Cloak o're his face;
I have quite lost the memory of this place.



I am as much to seek, as you, Sir.



Let us golto him, Sancho, and enquire▪
He has a notable good Meen; me-thinks,
I ne'r saw an Air more like Octavio's




Unless my eyes do very much deceive me,
'Tis Don Antonio; if it be he, Diego,

There is no danger in his knowing us;*

He ever was my faithful friend; 'Tis he.



You injure me, Octavio, no be so long
A knowing one, who is so intirely yours.



Your presence, here, noble Antonio, was
So unexpected,* that I hardly durst
Believe my eyes, VVhen came you to this Town?



I am just 〈◊〉 arriv'd



I joy to see you here, but should have thought
It likelier to have heard of you at Court,
Pursuing there the Recompences due
To your transcendent Merit.



That is no place for men of my Moralitie.
I have been taught, Octavio, to Deserve,
But not to Seek Reward; that does prophane
The Dignity of Virtue; if Princes
For their own Interests will not advance
Deserving Subjects, they must raise Themselves
By a brave Contempt of Fortune.



I'm glad to find in you some Seeds yet left
Of th' Antient Virtue; may they Fruit produce
Fit to Illu rate, and Instruct the Age.
Let me once more embrace you, Sir, Welcome,
Brave Leader.



Oh, you must spare your Servants, Sir.



He has not liv'd i'th' reach of publick Fame,
Who has not heard your noble Character;
This is my house, be pleas'd, Sir, to go in,
And make it yours; though truly at the present
I am in a very ill condition
To receive the Honor of such a Guest;
Having by an unlucky accident,
Been forc'd of late to keep my self conceal'd.



I humbly thank you, Sir, but cannot yet
Receive that favour, for I here must stay
Expecting the Return of one, I sent
Before to town to my Brother-in-Law.



Have you a Brother-in-law in Sevil?

You surprize me much.



It is most true, Octavio, I come hither
A Marri'd man, as far as friends can make me.



Since it imports you not to miss your Servant,
Let us stay here without, untill he come;
And then go in, and rest your self a while.
But how go our publick Affairs in Flanders?




I left our Armies in a better state,
Than formerly.



And our brave Vellada (I suppose) in great
Reputation.



The Honor of our Country, and the Terror
Of others; Fortune consulted Reason,
When she bestow'd such Favours upon him.



They say he did VVonders at the Relief
of Juliers.




It was indeed a famous Action.



You'l much oblige me, if whilst you expect


Your Servant here, I might learn from your self
Some few particulars of your own Actions;
Fame speaks Loudly of them, but not Distinctly.




Fame, like Water, bears up the Lighter things,
And lets the Weighty sink; I am not us'd
To speak in the First person; but if needs
You'l have a story to fill up the time,
I'l tell you an Adventure of mine own,
Where you'l find Love so intermixt with Arms,
That (I am confident) 'twill raise your wonder,
How being prepossess'd with such a Passion,
I should (upon Prudential motives onely)
Be ingag'd (as now you find me) to Merry
A Lady whom I never saw.



The Person, and the Subject, Sir, do challenge
My best attention.



The following Evening to that glorious Day,*

Wherein our great Vellada gain'd such Fame,
Against the cautelous Nassaw▪ some Horse
Were sent from th'Armie, under my command
To cover the Limbourg Frontiers, expos'd
To th'Enemies Inroads; scarce setled there,
I receiv'd intelligence, that a Party
Of theirs (about two hundred Horse) were come
That very Evening to a neighbouring Village,
Intending there to lodge; I instantly
Cause Sound to Horse, and march to their Surprize
So luckilie, that by the break of day
Their Quarters were on fire.



You had been taught, Sir, by our wise General,
That Diligence in Execution is
Even above Fortune, Mistris of Success.



They made but faint resistance; some were slain,
Some perish'd in the flames, other escap'd,
Giving th'Alarm in Quarters more remote
To their Companions drown'd in Sleep and Wine;
Who, at the Out-cry, and the Trumpets sound,
Me-thinks I fancie starting from their Beds,
As pale and wan, as from their Dormitories
Those the last Trump shall rouze; differing in this,
That they awake to Live, but these to Die.



How Unsafe it is to be Secure!



Finding no more resistance, I made haste
To a lofty Structure, which I conceiv'd
To be the likeliest Quarter for their Chief;
Led thither by desire to rescue both;
Him, from the Soldier's rage; That, from the Fire.



A care most worthy of a gallant Leader.



But think, Octavio, how I was surpriz'd,
When, on the floor of a Pavillion,

Belonging to the Garden of that House,
I found a Woman of a Matchless Form,
Extended all along.



I easily can divine how such a Heart,
As harbours in the brave Antonio's breast,
May suffer at so Sad a Spectacle.



At the first sight I did believe her Dead;
Yet, in that state so Awful she appear'd,
That I approach'd her with as much Respect,
As if the Soul had animated still
That Body, which, though Dead, scarce Mortal seem'd.
But as the Sun from our Horizon gone,
His Beams do leave a Tincture on the Skies,
Which shews it was not long since he withdrew;
So in her lovely face there still appear'd
Some scatter'd streaks of those Vermillion Beams,
Which us'd t'irradiate that bright Firmament.
Thus did I find that distress'd Miracle,
Able to Wound a Heart, as if alive,
Uncapable to Cure it, as if dead.



I no more doubt your Pitty, than your Wonder.



My Admiration did suspend my Aid,
Till Passion join'd to Pitty, made me bold;
I kneel'd, and took her in my arms, then bow'd
Her body gently forward; with which motion,
A Sigh stole from her; O th'ravishing sound!
Which being a Symptom of remaining life,
Made me forget it was a sign of Grief.
At length she faintly opens her bright eyes;
So breaks the Day; and so do all the Creatures,
Rejoice, as I did, at the new born Light:
But as the Indians, who adore the Sun,
Are scorch'd by's Beams, ere Half his Race be Run;
So I, who did adore her Rising Eyes,
Found my self Wounded by those Deities.



How you have rais'd my Expectation!
Pray release me quickly.



From her fair hand a bloody Poniard fell,
Which she held fast during her Trance, as if
Sh'ad onely needed Arms whilst she did Sleep,
And trusted to her Eyes whilst she did Wake.
What I said to her, being a production
Of meer Extasie, I remember not;
She made me no Reply, yet I discern'd
In a Serener Air of her pale face,
Some Lines of Satisfaction mix'd with Fear.



Such looks in Silence have an Eloquence.
But pray go on.



Rais'd from the ground, and to her self return'd,
I stept a fitting distance back; as well
To gaze upon that lovely Apparition,
As to express Respect; when at that instant
The Trumpets sound a Charge; my Soldiers crie,
Where is our Leader? where's Antonio?

My Love a while disputed with my Honor,
But that the longer setled Power o'r-came,
And fear of Future danger to her Person
Made me then seek the Present for my self;
I came up to my Troops, left in Reserve,
As they were ready to receive a Charge
From divers Squadrons of fresh Horse, who being
Quarter'd in Neighbouring Villages, had taken
Hotly th'Alarm, and came (though then too late)
In succour of their friends; Honor and Love
Had so inflam'd my heart, that I advanc'd
Beyond the Rules of Conduct, and receiv'd
So many wounds, that I with faintness fell.



How can this Story end!



My Soldiers beat th' Enemy, and brought me off,
Where Surgeons quickly cur'd my Outward Wounds,
But the remembrance of that Heroine,

My Inward Hurts kept bleeding still afresh;
Till by the business of the War constrain'd
To attend my Charge i'th'Army, my despair
Of ever finding her, concurring with
The powerful perswasions of Vellada,

I was at length even forc'd to an Engagement
Of Marriage with a Lady of this City,
Rich, Noble, and, as they say, Beautiful.
And so you have me here, come to Consummate
Those Nuptial Rites, to which my Interest,
And th'Importunity of Friends advice,
O're-rule my judgment, though against my heart.



A wonderful Adventure! but pray, Sir,
May I not take the liberty to ask you,
Who may this noble Lady be, to whom
The Fates have destin'd so much Happiness?



I have no Reserves for you, 'tis the Sister
Of 
Enter Ernesto, and Octavio re∣tires
hastly, and covers his face
with his Cloak.
Antonio hodding to Octavio.
It is my Servant, Sir.



Step to Antonio, Diego, and desire him
To send him off.



I will immediately;* Well, Ernesto,

What good news? speak freely.



Sir, as you charg'd me, I told your Brother-in-Law,
I thought you hardly could be there this night;
He kisses your hands, and bad me tell you,
That he expects your coming with impatience;
He charg'd me to present you with this Letter;
Th'other is from your beauteous Bride, a person
The most accomplish'd that I ever saw.
My being yours gave me the privilege
Of a Domestick, in the free admission
To see her in her Chamber-dress, without
A Veil, either to cover Faults, or hide
Perfections.



Tell me truly, is she so very handsom?



Handsomer far in my opinion, Sir,
Than all the Bruxels Beauties, which you call
The Finish'd Pieces; but I'l say no more;
Let your own Eyes inform you; here's a Key
Of the Apartment, that's made ready for you;
A Lower Quarter, very nobly furnish'd,
That opens on St. Vincent's Street.



Give it me; and go you to the Post-house,
And take care that my things be brought from thence.



Octavio, will you go along with me,
And be a Witness of my first Address?



Sir, you choose in me an ill Companion
For Nuptial Joys, or any Happiness;
One, whose Misfortunes to such sad Extremes
Are heightned, that the very Mentioning
Of Happy hours serves onely to Imbitter
The memory of my Lost Joys.



So deep a sense of your Misfortunes, Sir,
Is prejudicial to your Self and Friends.




Where's your Master, Diego?




There's some Ill towards,* when this Bird appears,
Do you not see him? I have liv'd too long a Maid.



I have something to say to you in private,* Sir,
That requires haste.



What new Accident brings you hither, Flora?




These Tablets will inform you,* Sir, Farewell.



Will you not stay for an Answer Damsel?




'Tis a Command, not a Question Diego.




Short, and Sweet, Flora.




Good Flora stay a Minute; I much fear
It is some new Misfortune.



Nay, Sir, you may be sure 'tis some Disaster,
Else it would ne'r have come so Easily,
And so Unsought for.



Will you allow me for a Moment,* Sir,
To step into my House, and read a Letter.



I'l attend you in, and wait your leisure.





These little black Books do more Devils raise,
Than all the Figures of the Conjurers.
What can this be? I have not seen this Damsel

With so busie a face; but here she comes
Already, 'twas a quick dispatch.




A Word, Flora, or a kind Glance at least,
What? grown cruel? Diego no body w'you?



This is no time for fooling.



Nay, if you be so serious, fare you well;
Yet I'l perform the Honor of our Street,
And bring you to the end on't.



I shall be well holp up with such a Squire;
If now some wandring Knight should chance t'assault you,
To bear away your Damsel, what would you do?



I'd use no other Weapon but a Torch;
I'd put aside your Veil, show him your face,
That, I suppose, would guard us both.



Why, d'you think it would fright him, Diego?




Oh no, 'twould charm him, Flora.




Well, such as 'tis, I'l venture it without
Engaging your known Valour.



Faith you may so;
The face, dear Flora, defends all below.



Away, you Fool; Good-night to you.







What may this be? O my Malignant Fate!
The Warning's short, yet she must be Obey'd;
The hour draws near;* I must go seek a Friend;
Her words seem to imply need of a Second;
'Twere barbarous to engage Antonio

Newly arriv'd, and come on such an Errand.
Noble Antonio, my confusion's great
To tell you thus abruptly, I must leave you;
Th' occasion's indispensable.



I must not quit you, Sir, I know too well
The Laws of Honor, to desert you now:
When I my friend in such disorder see,
And all the Marks that he is call'd to Danger,
To leave him then 



It is a Summons from a Lady, Sir,
Whom I have lov'd with Passion and Success;
To meet her in her Garden presently:
All is propitious on her part and mine;
But she's so Guarded by a Tyrant Brother,
So Jealous naturally, and so Incens'd
By that new Accident I told you of,
Wich makes me a close Prisoner all the day;
That to perswade you there no Danger is
In this Adventure, were to abuse you;
But even for that reason I am bound
Not to consent to the Imbarking you
In an occasion that's so opposite
To what you come for; Antonio, We must
As well to Friends as to our Selves be just.



He ought not to pretend to Friendships name,
Who reckons not Himself and Friend the same.



Friendship with Justice must not disagree,
That were to break the Virtue's Harmony.



Who in his Friends Distresses takes no part,
His Friendship's onely in his Tongue, not Heart.



You from a life of Perils hither come
To find a Nuptial Bed, not seek a Tomb.



My Friend ingag'd, it never must be said,

Antonio left him so to go to Bed.



Y are marri'd, and expose what's not your own.



Wedded to Honor, that must yield to none.



I find, Antonio, you must still subdue.



I ow my Triumph to my Cause, not You.
Come, we lose time, your Mistris must not stay.



Who's so accompani'd, needs not fear his way.





Camilla, Porcia, Flora appear in a Balcone.


COme, Cozin, the hour assign'd approaches.



Nay, more than so, for 'tis already night.



And thanks to your Stars sufficiently dark.



To the Clowds you would say, Flora, for Stars,
In this occasion, would not much befriend us.
Pray, Cozin, when Octavio shall arrive,
Do you and Flora watch above with care;
For if my cruel Brother should surprize us 



Let us alone to play the Sentinels.



I'm confident he's abroad, and will not
Suddenly return; for I heard him say,
He'd pass th'Evening at the Corigidors;

And thence, you know, he seldom comes home early.


their faces, and their Swords undrawn in their hands.


Is it not something early for Adventures
Of this Nature?



'Tis the Hour she appointed.



How dark 'tis grown o'th'sudden, there's not one
Star appears in all the Firmament.



So much the better; for when I must fight,
I covet no Spectators of my Prowess.




Stay you here, Antonio, I'l step before,
And give the Sign; when you here the door open,
Then come on, and follow me in.





The Corigidors is a pretty place.



The Walks do so intice me, I always
Wearie my self, before I can retire.



Indeed we have staid longer than we thought,
And therefore let's go home the shorter way;
The back door of my Garden's here at hand.



It will be better than to go about.



Would he were come,* I fear the Rising Moon
Will give us little time.





I think I hear his usual Knock;* Who's there?







I hope y'are not alone.



No; here's Diego with me, and a Friend.



'Tis well; I'l open the door presently.



Come;* we are now hard by the Garden gate.



Let's to the door; sure she's there by this time;
Be not afraid Diego.




Agree that with him that made me, who has
Given me a Heart no bigger than my Thumb;
Y'had as good command me not to Breath.



Come on; what art thou thinking on?



That I see Company, or that my Fear does



Y' are in the right;* let's to avoid suspit on
Walk on at large, till they are out of distance.



I think I heard your Garden door open.



I think so too; Ha! at this time o'th' night?
What can be the meaning on't? 'Tis so.



They have open'd the door; 'tis time for me
To follow, surely Octavio is gone in.





What stay you for?*




What's that I hear? sure 'tis Porcia's voice.



What mean you to stand there? come in, I say.







Be patient,* Sir, and you will make a clearer
Discovery of your Affront.



You may come in securely,*Octavio:

I have set those will watch my Brothers coming.




Madam, I am not Octavio.




Not Octavio? who are you then? and who's
That Shadow there?



I can hold no longer;* I'm thy Chastiser,
Vile Woman, and his Mortal Enemy.



Ha! my Mortal Enemy?



Yes, Villain; who ere thou art, thou shalt pay
This Treacherie with thy Life.



Vain Man; who ere thou art, know, the Life thou
Threaten'st, is Guarded by too good a Sword.


Carlos draws, and they all enter the
Garden fighting.


Make fast the door.*




Thou art some desperate Villain hir'd to murder.*






Hir'd by Friendship, and Honor's my Sallary.




That's Antonio's voice within the Garden;*

What! the door shut! my Friend engag'd, and I


Excluded! cursed Fate! this Tree may help me
To climb o're; if not, I'l flie t' him.



You may do so; your noble Love has Wings,
And's ever Fledge;* 'tis Molting time with mine;
Yet I'l up too; the hazards not in climbing,
Here I will so, and out of dangers reach
Expect the Issue.


which they issue fighting.


Courage, brave Friend; you have Octavio by you.



So Seconded, a Coward would grow firm.



What! is there more of your crue? then 'tis time
To call for help; Ho! Sylvio, Geraldo,


Pedro, come forth; and bring out Torches with you.




Here am I, Sir; my Camerades will follow
As soon as they have lighted their Torches.*




How I despise these Slaves Octavio,

Having you by me!*




Their Swords do clatter bravely in the dark.









Good; that's Sylvio's voice; I have ow'd that Fellow
A Good-turn this Twelve-month for a Mistake,
Breaking my Head, when he should have Broke a Jeast;
Now he's paid.


Henrique stepping back falls over Sylvio, and
loses his Sword, and Carlos runs in to him.


What! are you hurt?



No, onely I fell; Help me to find my Sword.



What? d'you give back? you do well to take breath,
Whilst you have any left;* 'twill not be long,
Now that the Rising Moon lends us some light.






O Octavio! let not this moment slip
To Free me from my cruel Brother's Fury,
Or never hope to see me any more
Amongst the living.





Ah! Noble Maid, he that is once possess'd
Of such a Treasure, and safe-guards it not,
Let him live Wretched, and Detested die;
Where's my brave Friend?



You have me by your side, lead off your Mistris,
I'l secure your Retreat.*






That doubtless is my Master, who victorious
Is bravely marching off with his fair Prize;


I'l down, and follow, inventing all the way
Some handsome Lie t'excuse my Cowardice;
Why liv'd not I five thousand years ago,
Being ne'r made for this damn'd Iron Age?


Diego comes down from the Treee,
and follows Antonio.



But whilst my care led me to succour you,*

Our Enemies, I fear, are got away;
I heard the door open, and see none here,
Although the Night's much brighter grown than twas▪
I'l follow, and trace the Villains if I can
To their Dens; mean while take care of your Sister;
And (pray) till my return be Moderate.



How! Moderation in this case! what ho!

Geraldo, Pedro, ah ye cursed Rogues,
Enter Servants with Torches.
Durst ye not shew your heads till they were gone?

Geraldo, light me in, whilst Pedro looks
To his hurt Companion; ah Porcia! Porcia!



Sylvio fainting with his hurts.
The Scene Changes to the City of SEVIL.


and after him Carlos.



Sure,* that's Antonio bringing up the Rere;
Sir, th'are but just before us; he bears her
Most gallantly away; lose not sight of me.



This Fellow takes me for one of his Crew;
He will by his mistake help me to harbour 'em.








Was there ever such a Disaster, Flora?

Sure, th'are all dead, so great's the Silence.




MadÃ m, if mistake not very much,
I heard your Brother's voice amongst 'em.



Ah! my dear Brother, how thy ill-plac'd Friendship
Upon that Brutal Kinsman has abus'd
Thy Goodness; though my Natural affection
Moves me, Flora, to Pitty him in Danger,
Yet my Concernment for my Cozin Porcia

Does prevail at present; Porcia, Porcia;








Madam, let us go down into the Garden.



Take heed of that; 'twere to involve my self
In this unlucky Scandal; 'tis possible,
Affrighted with the Scuffle, she's return'd
Into her Quarter by the other door;
Let us hast thither.*




Oh! Madam, I see a Light, and Don Henrique

Coming this way with his Sword drawn, what shall
We do?



Peace;* let us hide our selves behind the door,
Till we discover his Intentions.


a Light; Henrique and Geraldo their Swords drawn.


Sir, I have search'd all the Rooms of the House,
And cannot find her.



Base Infamous Woman; may be she's fled
To th' Quarter order'd for Antonio.




That door is lock'd, his Servant has the Key.



Ah this unworthy Woman! thus to rob
A Brother of the Fruits of all his Care;
And cast this Stain on th' Honor of our House;
But if I ever get the Fugitive
Within my reach, I'l Sacrifice her Blood
To the Offended Spirits of my Ancestors.




Madam, d you hear?



I, and tremble, Flora.




Call out for her Woman.









My good Angel Guard me; what would you have Sir?



Where's your Mistris, Hussy?



She told me, Sir, 'bout half an hour since
She would go down into the Garden.





My Shame is certain; ah! the sad condition
Of us Men of Honor! how unequally
Our Crosses and our Comforts mingled are!
Our Orphan Sisters are no sooner grown
Above the Follies of their Childish Age;
During which Season Custom does exact
Our Watchful Caution over all their Actions;
But they are Grafted on some Stranger Stock,
Where they do change both their Aboads, and Names,
Without Reflexion in the least Degree
Of Gratitude, on those, who Pain'd themselves
To Cultivate their Youths; or else become


An Hourly Torture to us, whilst the best
Continu'd in our Care do never cease
To give the Fears at least of what I feel.
O unjust Heavens! why suffer you that they,
Who to our Joys of Life such Bubbles are,
Should add such Weight unto our Griefs, and Care?







Cozin, I'm much mistaken, or I have
In very Little time made a Great Progress
Towards your Revenge; I come from harbouring
The Villains, who have done you this Affront.



It imports to be attentive now.



Oh, you revive me, may I but once enjoy
The Pleasure of my Revenge, though the next
Moment were the last Period of my Life,
I should depart contented; are the Villains
Within our reach?



Be patient, Sir, and I'l inform you fully;
You were no sooner up, but I pursu'd
Your flying Enemies, hoping the night
Grown somewhat Lighter, would enable me
(At a convenient distance) to discover
The place of their Retreat; one of their Partie,
Who was behind the rest, mistaking me
For one of his Camerades, bad me come on;
Saying his Master was but just before;
That he had born his Mistris bravely off.
We had not past above a Street or two,
Before he stopt, and at the second House
Beyond the Church in St. Iago's Street,
He enter'd, and desir'd me to follow him;
I making a stand, he grew suspicious,
And from my Silence guessing his Mistake,
He slipt into the House, and lock'd the door;
I having well observ'd the street and House,
Return'd with speed to give you this account.



Oh, Madam, this is Don Octavio's House;
Without all doubt they've carri'd Porcia thither.



Peace, Flora, and listen to the sequel.



Come, Cozin; we loose time; call all my Servants;
I will besiege the House; if they refuse
To render; I will reduce that Theater
Of my Shame to Ashes, and make their Fort
Both Theirs and its own Sepulchre; There are
Such Charms in Vengeance, that I do not wonder,
It is reserv'd for him, who form'd the Thunder.



Have patience, Cozin, and consult your Reason;
'Twill soon convince you, how Unpracticable
And Vain your Proposition is, t'attempt
At this time of the night, within a City,
A House so Guarded, That, indeed, would prove
Very like Thunder, which the Clowd destroys
Wherein 'twas form'd, producing onely Noise.
What can the Issue be, but to Allarm
The Town; expose your Person, and your Fortune
To th' Rigour of the Law; publish your Shame;
And frustrate your Revenge for ever?



What! would you have me tarry till these Villains,
Who have invaded my House; Affronted
My Person; Murder'd my Servant; and Robb'd
Me of a Sister; may evade my Vengeance?



No; fear not that; let me alone to find
A certain way to hinder their escape;
I'l instantly to the Corrigidors,

And beg th'assistance of his Authority,
To secure these Criminals for the present,
That afterwards the Law may punish them.



A fine Proposal! why, Cozin, can you think
That I'l submit a Personal Injury
Unto a tame Decision of the Law?
And having been Affronted by the Sword,
To pray the Aid of the Long Robe, and take
An Advocate for Second?



Your Provocation's great, Resentment's just;
But, Cozin, the Greater they, the More you stand
In need of Moderation, and th'Advice
Of such a Friend, as you have always found me;
Nor can I e'r express it more than now,
In freely telling you, you must not suffer
Your Passion to Command in this Occasion;

Passion, which wheresoever it contends
To Govern most, there most Destroys its Ends.




Oh! how I hate your drie Moralitie!
To treat a Friend with Sentences, that's raging
In a Feaver; you may as well pretend
To teach a Man to Sing his Part, that's stretch'd
Upon a Rack; no, Sir, I'l sooner die,
Than ere consent to publish my Disgrace,
Before I have Reveng'd it.



'Tis far from my intent; all my design
Is onely how we may Conceal your Shame,
Till we have got these Villains in our Power.
Which can be brought about by no such means,
As by demanding Justice against those,


Who did assault your Person, and have slain
Your Servant; a most plausible pretence.
Will this content you? trust my Conduct Cozin;
Is not my Interest the same with yours?



Well, since it must be so, I pray make haste.



Doubt not my diligence; by this I'l prove
Friendship has Fire, and Wings as well as Love.



If you could F••e, you'd move with too much Leisure;
Ah tedious Minutes which Revenge does measure!





Madam, y'have heard their mischievous design.



Yes, Flora, out of question Porcia's there;
And if they find her, she is lost forever.



I'le try to Hinder it, though I were sure
To Perish in th' attempt; I am confident,
The House at present is in such confusion,
I may run thither without being miss'd.



'Tis well thought on; in th' interim I'l retire
To Porcia's Chamber.






Sir, Don Antonio is just now arriv'd.



Ha! what's that you say Sirrha?



That Don Antonio, Sir, your Brother-in-law
Is without, walking i'th' Hall, and bad me
Give you notice of it, shall he come in?




Antonio arriv'd! O Heavens! this Circumstance
Alone was wanting to complete my Shame.
When he desires to See his Wife, shall I
My self inform so generous a Person
That she is Run away? where shall I find
A Heart, a Tongue, a Voice, or Breath, or Face
To utter this unparallel•d Disgrace?



What is your pleasure, Sir? Don Antonio

May think it long.



Wait on him in, but at the same time tell him
You cannot find me; I will leave my House,
And the discovery of my Shame to Fate;
And any Censure rather undergo,
Than be Relater of my own Disgrace;
Till first I have my Honor's Ransom paid
In the Vile Blood of that perfidious Maid.







My Friend and his fair Mistris safely lodg'd,
And free from their Adventure; 'tis now fit
To mind my own Engagement; But Ernesto,

VVhat can the meaning be of this indecent


Suffering me to remain without thus long
Upon my first Arrival? come, let's go on
Into the other Rooms.



I swear, Sir, I'm amaz'd at this great change;
'Tis not above two hours, since I found here
A numerous and well-order'd Family,
In all appearance, now I see the Pages
Boult out of the doors, then start back again
Into their holes, like Rabbets in a Warren;
The Maids lie peeping at the Garret windows,
Like th'Upper Tire of Ordinance in a Ship;
All looks disorder'd now; nor can I guess
What may have caus'd so strange an alteration;
But there I see the Servant you sent in.





Friend, where's your Master?



I cannot tell, Sir.



Where is his Sister?



In truth I know not, Sir; we Men-servants
Have little to do in the Ladies Quarters.




This looks but odly; are you sure Ernesto,

Y'have not misguided me to a wrong House?



If you are certain that we are awake,
Then I am certain this is the same House
Wherein this afternoon I saw, and spoke with

Don Henrique and your Bride; by the same Token
There was a Lady with her in a Veil;
And this very Room is the Ante-chamber
To her Apartment.



I should be finely serv'd, if after all
This Negotiation, and a tedious Journey,
My Pains and Patience should be cast away
On some such wither'd Sybil for a Wife,
As her own Brother is asham'd to show me.*




You'l soon be freed from that fear, Sir.







Because I see her in the Inner Room,
Lying along upon her Couch, and Reading;
Her face is turn'd the other way, but yet
Her Shape, and Cloathes assure me it is she.



Art sure 'tis she?



There are not many like her.



If thou be'st sure 'tis she, I'l venture in,
Without her Brother's help to introduce me.



She's coming this way, Sir.





Y'have reason, Dido, and 'tis well remarqu'd,

The Woman, who suffers her self to Love,
Ought likewise to prepare her self to Suffer;

There was great Power in your Charms, Aeneas,

T'enthrall a Ladies heart at first approach,
And make such early and such deep Impressions,
That nothing, but her death, could ere deface.
Alas! poor Dido!




What do I see;* or do I waking dream?
Sure I am asleep; and 'tis a Vision
Of her, who's always present to my Thought;
VVho fearing my Revolt does now Appear
To Prove and to Confirm my Constancy.
When first I saw that Miracle, she seem'd
An Apparition, here it must be one.



What fit of Frenzy's this, Sir? why 'tis Porcia▪

A Lovely Living Woman, and your Bride.



The Blessing is too mighty for my Faith.



Faith! ne'r trouble your Faith in this occasion,
Approach her boldly, Sir, and trust your Sense.



As when we dream of some Transporting Pleasure,
And finding that we Dream we fear to Wake,
Lest Sense should rob us of our Fancie's Treasure,
And our Delightful Vision from us take;
Bless'd Apparition, so it fares with me.
That very Angel does once more appear,
To whose Divinity long since I rais'd
An Altar in my Heart, where I have Offer'd
The constant Sacrifice of Sighs and Vows.
My eyes are open, yet I dare not trust 'em;
Bliss above Faith must pass for an Illusion;
If such it be, O let me sleep for ever
Happily deceiu'd; but Celestial Maid,
If this thy glorious Presence Real be,
O let one word of Pitty raise my Soul
From Visional Delights, and make me die
With Solid Joy instead of Extasie.



'Slife! he's in one of his old Fits again;
VVhy what d'you mean, Sir? 'tis Porcia herself.



I am that Maid, who to your Virtue owes
Her Honor then, and her Disquiet since;
Yet in my Pain I cannot but be Pleas'd
To find a Stronger Passion justifi'd
By Obligation; I may avow the Fire,
To which both Love and Gratitude conspire.



Incomparable Creature! can it be?


That having Suffer'd all, which mighty Love
Did e'r inflict, I now should be repaid
With fuller Joys, than Love could ever give;
Fortune to make my Happiness complete,
Has joyn'd her Power, and made me find a Bride
In a Lost Mistris, but with this Allay,
Of leaving me no Means my Faith to prove,
Since Chance anticipates the Hopes of Love.



The Servant's Error has misled the Master,
He takes me too for Porcia, bless'd Mistake;
Assist me now Artful Dissimulation;
But how can that consist with so much Passion?
Aside.
'Tis possible the Sense of my Distress'd
Condition might dispose a Gentle heart
To take Impressions then, which afterwards
Time, and your Second Thoughts may have Destroy'd;
But can a Constant Passion be produc'd
From those Ideas Pitty introduc'd?
Let your Tongue speak your Heart, for should y'abuse me,
I shall in time discover the Deceit;
You may Paint Fire; Antonio, but not Heat.







Hold; be not too Scrupulous, Antonio;

Let me Believe it, though it be not True;
For the chief Happiness, poor Maids receive,
Is when our Selves we happily Deceive.



If, since I first those Conquering Eyes beheld,
You have not reign'd Unrival'd in my Heart;
May you Despise me now you are my Own,
Which is, I think, all Curses summ'd in one.
But may your Servant, Madam, take the boldness
To ask, if you have ever thought of him?



A Love, so founded in a Noble Heart,
Has need of no Remembrancer, Antonio;

You know your self too well; those of your Trade
Have skill to Hold, as well as to Invade.



Fortune has lifted me to such a Height
Of Happiness, that it may Turn my Brain,
When I look down upon the rest o'th' world.
VVhat have I now to wish but Moderation
To Temper, and to Fix my Joys?



I yield as little t'you, noble Antonio,

In Happiness, as Affection, but still

Porcia must do as may become your Bride,
And Sister to Don Henrique, in whose absence
A longer Conference must be excus'd.
And so I take the freedom to withdraw.


  35Should I have staid untill Don Henrique came,
His presence would have marr'd my whole design.






Where Beauty and Discretion so combine,
'Tis Heaven, me-thinks, to find that Treasure mine.





Sure Don Antonio, having long ere this
Found out th' infamous Flight of my vile Sister,
VVill be retir'd to meditate Revenge
Upon us both: ah Curse! he is there still;
I'l slip away; but, O Heavens! 'tis too late,
He has perceiv'd me.



How, Don Henrique! avoid your Friend? that's come
So long a Journey t'embrace you, and cast
Himself at the feet of your fair Sister?



Noble Antonio, you may well imagine
The trouble I am in, that you should find
My House in such Disorder, so unfit
The Honor to receive of such a Guest.



'Tis true, Don Henrique, I am much surpriz'd
With what I find; I little did expect
Your Sister Porcia should have been 



Oh Heavens!* I'm lost, he has discover'd all.
'Tis not, Antonio, in a Brothers power
To make a Sister of a better Paste,
Than Heaven has made her.



In your case specially; for out of doubt,
Heaven never made a more Accomplish'd Creature.



What means the Man?



I come just now from Entertaining her:
Whose Wit, and Beauty so excell all those
Of her fair Sex, whom I have ever known,
That my Description of her would appear
Rather Detraction, than a Just Report
Of her Perfections.



Certainly he mocks me; he never could
Have chosen a worse Sufferer of Scorn;
But I will yet contain my self awhile
To see how far he'l drive it; Say you, Sir,
Aside.
That you have Seen, and Entertain'd my Sister?



Yes, Don Henrique, and with such full Contentment,
So rais'd above Expression, that I think
The Pains, and Cares of all my former Life
Rewarded with Excess, in the Delight
Of those few Minutes of her Conversation;
'Tis true, that Satisfaction was abridg'd
By her well-weigh'd Severity; to give me


A greater Pleasure in the Contemplation
Of her discreet Observance of the Rules
Of Decency; not suffering me, though now
Her Husband, any longer to enjoy
So great a Happiness, you being absent.



I am confounded;* but I must dissemble
My Astonishment, till I can unfold
The Mysterie; She might have spar'd that Caution,
But I suppose you'l easily Forgive
An Error on the Better side.



Sir, I have seen so much of her Perfections
In that short Visit, I shall sooner doubt
All Definitions in Morality,
Than once suppose her capable of Error.



This Exposition makes it more Obscure:*

I must get him away. Sir, is't not time
I bring you to your Chamber? it is late,
And I believe that you have need of Rest.



I should accept your offer, were I not
Oblig'd, as late as 'tis, to see a Friend
Before I go to Bed.



I'l wait on you, Sir, if you I give me leave.



I humbly thank you, Sir, but can't consent
To give you so much trouble; I'l return
Within an hour at farthest.



When e'r you please; y'are wholly Master here.



I never saw a man so Discompos'd,*

What e'r the matter is.

Ernesto, I must make a step to see
A Friend near hand; bid Sancho follow me;
And stay you in my Chamber till I come.





Your Servant,* Sir; this sudden Salley hence
At this time of the night, and newly arriv'd
From a long Journey, does imbroil me more.
But now I will not long be in Suspense;
I'l to my Sister's Chamber.




Ho Don Henrique, there is haste requir'd; all's
Prepar'd, and if the Quarrie lodg'd shall prove
Worthy of our own Swords, we may employ them;
If not, the Sword of Justice shall revenge
Our Injuries; for the Corrigidor

Is ready with a Band of Serjeants.



Speak softly; Don Antonio is arriv'd,
And some of his may over-hear us.



That's very unlucky, but does he know






I think not yet.



Come, let's away; we have no time to lose.



Pray stay awhile; I labour with a Doubt
Will burst me if not clear'd before I go.



What Cozin! will you loose an Opportunity
Never to be recover'd? are you mad?
Will you permit the Villains to escape,*

And laugh at us for ever? come away.




Well, I must go; and let time make it out;

The worst Estate of Human Life is Doubt.





Enter Octavio angrily pushing Diego, and Porcia following.


VIllain, thou hast undone us, cursed Villain;
Where was thy Soul, had Fear quite Banish'd it?
And left thee not one grain of common Sense?



Was there ever so fatal an Accident?



Why, Traitor, did'st thou not let me know it,
As soon as we were come into the House?



What would y' have done if ye had known it then?



I would have fally'd out, and Kill'd the Rogue,
In whose Power thou hast put it to Destroy us;
Can it be doubted, but that long ere this
He has acquainted Henrique where we are?
From whose black Hage we must immediately
Expect to encounter all the pernicious
Effects of Malice, back'd by Seeming Iustice;
Curse on all Cowards! better far be serv'd
By Fools, and Knaves: they make less dang'rous Faults.



Am I in fault, because I'm not a Cat?
How could I tell i'th' dark whether that Rascal
Was a Knight Errant, or a Recreant Knight?
I thought him one of us, and true to Love;
Were it not for such Accidents as these
That mock Man's Fore-cast, sure the Destinies
Had ne'r been plac'd amongst the Deities.



Peace, cowardly Slave; having thus plaid the Rogue,
Art thou Sententious grown? did I not Fear
To Stain my Sword with such Base Blood, I'd let


Thy Soul out with it at a thousand wounds.



VVhy then a thousand Thanks to my Base Blood
For saving my Good Flesh.*




Pardon, my dearest Mistris, this Excess
Of Passion in your presence.



What shall we do Octavio? we are lost
For ever; if we should stay here, my Brother
Will be upon us instantly. Alas!
My own Life I value not Octavio,

Where yours, my Better life, such hazard runs;
But O my Honor! O my Innocence!
Expos'd to Scandal; there's my deepest Sense.



Though the Complexion of your Brother's Malice.
Resemble Hell, it is not Black enough
To cast a Stain upon your Virgin Whiteness.
As Contraries compar'd set off each other,
The sister's Brightness will expose the Brother.



O my Octavio! he is still my Brother;
But what do you resolve to do?



I must resolve and suddenly, but what
I swear know not, there have been such Turns
In my Misfortunes, they have made me giddy.



You must determine, time wastes Octavio.




If I should lead you through the Streets, and meet
Th'in quisitive Justice, I daring not
T'avow my self upon the other score
You know of, you might that way be in danger;
We must not venture 't;* Run Rascal, and fetch
A Chair immediately.



A pretty Errand at this time o'th' night;
These Chair-men are exceedingly well natur'd,
Th'are likely to obey a Servant's Orders
After ten a clock.





Ye Powers above, why do ye lay so great
A Weight on Human Nature, and bestow
Such an Unequal Force to bear our Loads?
After a long pursute through all those Storms,
Which Hell-bred Malice, or the Power of Fate
Could ever raise, t'oppose a Noble Love;
To be at length posse s'd of the Rich Mine,
Where Nature seem'd to have lodg'd all her Treasure;
And in an instant have it ravish'd from me,
Is too rude a Trial for my tir'd Patience
To su••ain; I cannot bear it.



My Sense of this Misfortune Equals yours,
But yet I must conjure you to submit
To Heavens Decrees; such Resignation
'Tis possible, their Justice may induce


The mischief to divert, though ne'r so near.



Ah Porcia to part with you!



Loose not your self with me, though we are forc'd
To Separate, yet we are not Divorc'd.



Whilst our Souls act by Organs of the Sense,
'Twixt Death and Parting there's no difference.



Consult your Reason, then you will comply;
Making a Virtue of Necessity.



Ah lovely Maid, 'twas not allow'd to Jove

To hold at once his Reason, and his Love.





The Chair is come, Sir, just as I expected.







Even where it was; they are deeply engag'd
At New Cut, and will not leave their Game,
They swear, for all the Dons in Sevil.




A curse upon these Rogues! I'l make 'em come,
Or put some of 'em in a condition
To be carri'd themselves.






Madam, though I was never yet Unkind
To my own Person, I am so much troubled
At the Disquiet my Mistake has brought you,
That could I do it conveniently, i'faith,
I could even cudgel my self.



Away Buffon, is this a time for fooling?





Where is my noble Friend Octavio?




Did you not meet him at the door, Sir?







He went out just as you came in.




Madam,* I might have gone to Bed, but not
To Rest, without returning to enquire
Anew of Yours, and of my Friends Condition;
And once more offer you my Service.



I take the boldness in Octavio's absence
To return his with my most humble Thanks
For your late generous Assistance of us,
And for this new Addition to our Debt.




Madam, though I have not the Happiness
To be Known to you, yet my constant Friendship
With Octavio is of an antient Date;
And all Occasions where I may express
The Fervour of it, are most welcome to me.



Enter Flora in great haste.


O Madam I'm out of breath with running.



What Accident, Flora, brings you hither?



A sad one, Madam, and requiring haste,
To give you timely notice on't; Don Carlos,

Assisted by the light o'th' Rising Moon,
And by a Mistake of some of your Train,
Has Trac'd you to this House, and in my hearing,
Inform'd your Brother of the Place, and Manner
Of your Retreat, who is now coming hither
Accompani'd with the Corigidor,

To seize on whomsoever shall be found
Within these Walls, upon pretence of Murder.








Madam, make haste, get out at the back door;
Or you will certainly be met withall.



How vile a Creature am I now become!
For though in my own Innocence secure,
As to my self, t'others I shall appear
Some wicked Woman, that has sold her Honor
To purchase Infamy.



They'l instantly be here.



O that Octavio should just now be absent!
But to expect till he return were madness.



Y' have reason, Madam, and if you dare trust
Your Person to the Conduct of a Stranger,
Upon my Honor, Lady, I'l Secure you,
Or Perish in th'Attempt.



Generous Sir, how shall a wretched Maid,
Abandon'd by her Fare to the pursute
Of an Inhumane Brother, e'rbe able
Either to Merit, or Requite your Favours?




Madam, they're more than Paid in the Admission,
And your Acceptance of them will transfer
The Obligation, making me the Debtor.



To your Protection I resign my self,
With equal Gratitude and Confidence.



Come Madam, there is no time to be lost;

Diego, find out your Master presently,
And tell him, that the Danger not allowing
Our Stay till his Return, I shall convey
His Mistris safely to a Nunnerie.



And Flora, stay you here to bring me word,
What he resolves to do in this our desp'rate
Condition.










But stay;* I swear I'd like to have committed


A foul Mistake; the Monastery Gates
Will not be open'd at this time of Night,
Without a strict Inquiry into the Cause;
Besides, 'tis possible, that once Lodg'd there,
She may be out of my Friends Power, or mine,
Ever to get her thence if it be known.
Lady, I have thought better on't; I shall
Conduct you to my Brother-in-law's house;
A Person of such Quality, and Honor,
As is fit to engage in your Protection;
And there my Wife may have the Happiness
T' accompany you, and pay the Offices
Due to your Virtue, and distress'd Condition:
And going to a House that's so much mine,
Make account, Madam, 'tis to your own Home.

Sancho, stay you here to attend Octavio,

And guide him the next way to my Apartment;*

Here is the Key; I shall have little use on't,
Having left Ernesto waiting for me there.
One word more, Sancho; let Octavio know
'Tis my advice that he come in a Chair;
He by that means may scape Examination,
Should he be met with.




Flora, I pray do you continue here,
And if by any accident Octavio

Should hindred be from coming after us,
Observe his Motions, and where he Fixes;
Then return home; and I shall find some way
Of sending to you to inform my self.



I shall not fail t'observe your Orders, Madam.





Madam, I'm ready to wait on you.



An cruel Brother! ah my dear Octavio!

O how perverse, and rigorous is my Fate!
Thus to torment me betwixt Love and Hate.





'Tis no small Compliment my Master makes
Your Ladie, and her Gallant, at this time
O'th' night to quit his Brother-in-laws, and leave
So fair a Bride as Porcia all alone.



What? is his Mistris's name Porcia too?



Yes; and if she has but as fair a Hand-maid
As your self, I shall soon forget my Damsel
In the Low-countries.




If your Low-country Damsels resemble us,
You would not be put to't to forget first;
But I believe that you are safe enough;
I have not heard such Praises of their Wit,
But that we may suppose they have good Memories.





Is not my Master yet return'd?







Well; now have we an Honorable Cause
To wear the Beadles Livery; faith, Flora,

If your tender Sex had not been privileg'd
From this harsh Discipline, how prettily
Would the Beadles Crimson Lace show upon
Thy white back.



'T won't do so well as on a darker ground;
'Twill suit much better with your Tawney hide.



I pray, Camerade, is it the Mode in Sevil

To be Whip'd for Company?



Oh! a well-bred Soldier will ne'r refuse
Such a Civility to an old Friend;
This is a new way of being a Second,
To shew your Passive Courage.



We Soldiers do not use to show our Backs.



Not to your Enemies; but, Sir, the Beadle
Will prove your Friend, for your Blood being Heated
With your long Journey, Breathing of a Vein
Is very requisite.



Would to Heaven that I were in the Camp again:
There we are never stript till we are dead.




Be sure you stir not thence till I return.*






She's fled away i'th'dark, with a Young man
Of your acquaintance.



Rascal, leave your fooling.



There's none i'th' case, Sir, 'tis the wisest thing
She ever did, had she staid your return,
She would have fall'n into those very Clutches,
In which you will immediately be grip'd,
Unless you make more haste: Flora is come
With all possible speed, to let you know
Th'are coming with the Justice to lay hold
Of all within this House, upon pretence
Of a most horrid Murder; be quick, Sir;
And save your self. She's safe in a Nunnerie;
Conducted thither by Antonio;

Where, poor Lady, she's dropping for you now
More Beads, perhaps, than Tears.



Peace Screetch-Owl; Fire consume that Tongue of thine.
What saist thou Villain? in a Nunnerie?

Porcia in a Nunnerie? O Heavens! nothing


But this was wanting to make me Desperate;
What hope's there left ever to get her thence,
After such Accidents as these made Publique?
Ah Flora, is it true that my dear Porcia

Is gone into a Monastery?



Once, Sir, 'twas so resolv'd, and Diego sent
To give you notice on't; but afterwards
He being gone, they chang'd their Resolutions:
There's one can tell you more 



My Master bad me stay to let you know
He has convey'd her to his own Apartment,*

In his Brother-in-laws House, a person
So eminent in Quality, and Credit,
That the ingaging him in her, and your
Protection, Sir, may much avail you both;
Besides, she'l have the pleasure there of being
Very well treated by my Master's Bride.
There he'l expect you, Sir, and does advise
Your coming in a Chair, to avoid Question
In case of any Encounter.



And my walking by, Sir, as an Attendant,
Will pass you without scruple for a Lady.



I'l take his counsel, he's a generous Friend,
Come Chair-men, away.* Pray, friend, do you guide us.



Up with your Burden Beasts, and fall forth-with
To your Half-Trot.


The Chair is carri'd over the Stage,
Diego, Sancho, and Flora follow.
A Noise within, Follow, follow, follow.



Sancho, Flora, and Diego.


This is one of Don Cupid's pretty Jeasts.
W'are struck upon a Shelf before we could
Put out to Sea.



Oh, we are undone Diego!




You find,* Sir, my Conjectures not ill grounded.



What are you, Sirrha?



A Living Creature, very like a Man,
Onely I want a Heart.



Y'are pleasant, Sir, pray Heaven your mirth continue.
Who is that Woman with the Veil?



Let her answer for her self, sh'has a Tongue,
Set it but once a going, and she'l tell
All that she knows, and more.



Make her discover her face.




Hold Friend; Cozin, if it should be Porcia,



'Twere not fit to expose her here.



'Tis very well consider'd, go you to her,
And speak to her in private.




'Tis I Sir, Flora, who being commanded
By my Lady 



Speak softly prithee Flora, 'tis enough;
I understand the rest, and pitty her;
Bid her sit still i'th' Chair, I'l do my best
To save her from the Fury of her Brother.




He thinks 'tis Porcia there, a good Mistake,
It may secure Octavio for the present
From the hands of this rude Rabble;* Sit still,
They take you for my Mistris Sir, I'l follow
The Chair, and have a watchful Eye on all
Occasions, that may further your Escape.



We have found our wandring Nymph.




Is it Porcia her self?



No, 'tis her Woman Flora following
The Chair, wherein they were conveying her
To some other place.



We arriv'd luckily, had we but staid
A moment longer, they had all been fled.



Will you have us see, Sir, who's in the Chair?



Forbear Fellow!* Her own Folly's punishment
Enough't'a Woman of her Quality,
Without our adding that of Publique shame.



'Twas luckily thought on, when you oblig'd

Don Henrique to expect us at your House;
For had he come, and found his Sister thus,
'T had not been possible to have restrain'd
His Passion from some great Extravagance.



I could not think it fit to let him come;
For one of such a Spirit could ne'r brook
The sight of those had done him these Affronts,
Without invading those strict Rules, which might
Render his Life obnoxious to the Laws.
'Tis better that a business of this nature,
(Chiefly 'twixt Persons of such Quality)
Should rather be reduc'd by Mediation
(If it be possible) to some fair Agreement,
Than to a publique Trial by the Law,
Or, which is worse, some Barbarous Revenge.



This Fellow (if I am not much mistaken)
Is Don Octavio's Man.*




Who do you belong too, Friend?



To no body, Sir.



Do not you serve?



Yes Sir, but my Master is not himself.



Take his Sword from him Serjeant.*





Diego disarm'd by any other hand
Than by his own? know Friend, it is a Weapon
Of such dire Execution, that I dare not
Deliver it, but to the hands of Justice.

The Corrigidor receives the Sword, and
gives it to one of his Serjeants.

Signior, pray call for it, when you come home,
And hang't up in your Hall, then under-write,
This is bold Diego's Sword; O may it be
Ever from Rust, as 'tis from Slaughter free.



Thou art a Fellow of a pleasant humour.



Signior, I never pain my self for Love,
Or Fame, or Riches, nor do I pretend
To that great subtilty of Sense to Feel
Before I am Hurt, and for the most part
I keep my self out of Harms way.



The Definition of a Philosopher.



Come, leave your fooling Sirrha, wher's your Master?



I am afraid we are not to be parted.



Whom do you mean?



My Master, my Self, and the Fool your Worship
Mentions, for sure one that had any Wit,
Would never serve a Lover Militant;
He had better wait upon a Mountebank,
And be run through the Body twice a week
To recommend his Balsom.



This Fellow's an Original.



But of so ill a hand, I am not worth
The hanging up, Sir, in my Masters room,
Amongst the worst of your Collection.




An't please your Worship, we have search'd the House,
From th' Cellars to the Garrits, and these are all
The living Cattel we can find.



Friends take a special care of that same Varlet,
And the Waiting-woman; we'l find a way
To make them tell the Truth, I warrant you.



O Diego! must we be Prisoners together?



Why, that's not so bad as the Bands of Wedlock,
Flora.



Come, let's away; but whither to convey her 
To her own House certainly were not fit,
Because of her incensed Brother.



If you approve it, Cozin, I'l carry her
To mine; for since we seek (if possible)


The business to compose, she will be there
With much more Decency, and Satisfaction,
And less expos'd to Censure of the World,
Being in a Kinsmans House, and having there
My Sister to accompany her.



This business cannot be in better hands,
Than yours; and there I'l leave it, and bid you
Good-night.



Your Servant Cozin,* I wish you well home.
Cozin, you may be please to take your Serjeants
Along with you; there are without two Servants
Belonging to Don Henrique, they'l suffice
To guard our Prisoners, and with far less notice.



Come Serjeants, follow me.



Well,* you may go about your business, Friends,
I'l not be troubled with ye; I am glad
We did not find Octavio here; though I
Might unaffected Ignorance pretend,
I would not bring him (though by chance) t'his End.




Well, I am now sufficiently instructed,
And since there is no notice taken of me,
I'l fairly steal away, and give my Master
Account of this Misfortune.





Take up the Chair, and follow me.




A Lovely Dame they bear, 'tis true, she's something
Hairie, but that's a sign of Strength.



Make haste, I long to let Don Henrique know,
That his lost Sister is by my dexterity
Recovered, and I hope to find some means
To calm his Furie, and to repossess
My Cozin Porcia, and (if't be possible)

Octavio of his good Graces. Come away.




How like an Ass he'l look, when op'ning the Shell,
His Worship finds within so rough a Kernel.



in Don Henrique's House.





Madam, banish all your Fears, you are now
Safe in this House; be pleas'd to remain here,
Till I shall bring some Lights, and acquaint Porcia

With th' Honor she receives in entertaining


So fair a Guest.



Who is't you say you will advertise Sir?



My Wife Porcia; have but a little patience;
And she shall wait upon you.





Is her name Porcia too? I pray Heaven send her
A better Fate than her distressed Names-sake.
O Octavio! O Love! how dear do you
Cost me! where am I brought? what House is this?
What with my Fears, and Darkness, I have lost
All my measures; I can't so much as guess
What Quarter of the Town it is w'are in,
For to avoid th' Encounter of my Brother,
And his Revengeful Train, we have been forc'd
To make so many Turnings, I am Giddy.
But thanks to Providence I have this comfort,
That I am in a place out of his reach.





Madam, my Wife will presently attend you.
Pardon I pray my absence for a moment.





Now I begin to hope my Sighes, and Tears,
Have in some sort with the just Heavens prevail'd
At length to free me * But what do I see!
Am I awake, or is it an Illusion?
Is not this my Brother's House? Is not this
The Quarter joining to my own Apartment?
There is no room for Doubt, and my Misfortunes
Are always Certain; Miserable Creature,
That I should be thus Bandi'd up and down
From one Hazard t'another, greater still.
Ah cruel Heavens! what have I ever done
To deserve this lasting Persecution?
But how came I here? brought by Octavio's friend,
Upon whose Virtue I did so relie
That I my Brothers Malice durst defie.
Can he betray me? sure I am in a Dream.
But if Octavio  O vile Suspition!

Octavio false? no, Truth and He are one.
'Tis possible his Friend may guilty be;
But to what end so base a Treacherie:
And if Perfidious, how could he be his Friend.
I am confounded with the various forms
Of my Misfortunes, Heightned still the more,
The less I can their Hidden Cause explore.
This onely's evident, that I must flie
Immediately this fatal place; But why
Struggle I thus with Fate? since Go, or Stay,


Death seems alike to wait me every way.*






I wonder much what Lady this can be






Pardon, my dearest Mistris, the Liberty
Which I so early take; but I presume
Such is your Generous Tenderness to those,
Whose sad Misfortunes, not their Faults, have driven
Into Distress, that you will think your self
Oblig'd to him, who gives you the occasion
To exercise those Virtues which do Visit
Others, but Reside with you; This fair Lady 
But she will best relate her own sad Story;
Whilst I seek out Don Henrique, and engage him
Both to Protect and Serve her with his Credit.



Upon Camilla's approach Porcia takes
the Handkerchief from her Eyes.


Ha!* what's that I see? stay, stay Antonio.

It is not fit Don Henrique,  but he's gone,
And we are lost for ever.



O Heavens! is this Antonio, the same Man
To whom I am Betroth'd? then my Destruction
Is inevitable.



Are you an Apparition? or are you

Porcia her self? speak, that when y' have said it thrice
I may not yet believe you.



You well may Doubt even what you See Camilla;

Since my Disasters are so new, and strange,
They sever Truth from Credibility.



How is it possible you should be here?



I know not how, onely of this I'm sure,
I have not long t'expect the dismal end
Of my sad Tragedy; since 'tis evident
The Person that hath led me to this Place,
This fatal Place, is the abus'd Antonio;

Who with my Cruel Brother has conspir'd
To take away my wretched life, and chose
This Scene as fittest for their Cruelty.
And thus, strange Fate! (through ignorance betraid)
I have Protection sought from the same Partie,
Whom I have Injur'd, and have made my Husband
Th'onely Confident of his own Affront:
Who to accomplish his too just Revenge,
As well upon my Family, as Person,
Gives me up to be Murder'd by my Brother.


So whilst I'm branded as a Faithless Bride,
He'l be detested as a Particide.



Prodigious Accident! but wert thou blind
Not to know thine own House unhappy Porcia?




Alas, how could I in so dark a Night,
In such Confusion, and so full of Fear?
Besides, he brought me in by the Back way,
Through his own Quarter, where was neither Light,
Nor any Creature of the Family.



Although I cannot comprehend the steps
Of this your strange Adventure, yet dear Cozin,
Your case (as I conceive) is not so desperate.




We easily perswade our selves to hope
The things we wish; but Cozin, my condition
Will not admit Self-flattery, and what
Can you propose to temper my Despair?



Don't you remember, how this very Evening

Antonio's Man finding me in your Quarter
Without a Veil (you having put on mine)
That he appli'd himself to me, and I
By your command, your Person did assume?







The Master since has by the Man's Mistake
Been happily led into the same Error,
And I not disabus'd him yet, in hopes
It might produce Advantage to us both.



Oh! he has spoken with my Brother since;
Who sure has Undeceiv'd him long ere this.
No, without doubt they having found themselves
Affronted both, have both conspir'd my death.



How Cozin can that be? if Don Antonio

In your Protection has engag'd himself,
And is Octavio's Friend.



Cozin, if you impartially reflect
On the Affront which I have done Antonio,

You will not wonder much if he recede
From the scarce-troden Path of rigid Honor
To meet with his Revenge; and to that end
Proceeds thus cautelously, and does seign
Not to know me, that he may disavow
Both to Octavio, and to all the world,
Th'Infamy of Betraying a poor Maid
To loss of Life and Honor.



Misfortunes make you rave; this vile Suspition
Is inconsistent with Antonio's Fame:
You may as well believe that Nature will
Reverse the order of the whole Creation,
As that Antonio, a Man, whose Soul


Is of so strong, and perfect a Complexion,
Should ere descend to such a slavish Sin.
And if we had the leisure, I could give you
Such reasons to convince you of your Error,
That you would easily acknowledge it.



I had forgot her near Concernments for

Antonio.* Pardon and Pitty me Camilla;

My mind is by Afflictions made so Weak,
I'm ready to believe Impossibilities.



I Pitty thee with all my heart; but Cozin,
If Antonio not knowing you, nor your
Relations, should chance to find your Brother,
And him inform of what has pass'd, and that
He has convey'd the distress'd Partie hither,
He'l presently imagine it is you;
And then (I fear) 'twill be impossible
(Though he should interpose with all his power)
To stop the Torrent, or divert his Rage
From breaking in, and executing on us
That horrid Parricide, which (though too late)
It may be he himself would execrate.



There's too much ground for what you fear Camilla:

But if we could secure our selves this night,
There were some hopes that we tomorrow may
Engage both Don Antonio, and your Brother
To find out some Expedient to redeem me
From this deplorable condition.



Were you onely in pain for your Security
This night, I know an easie Remedy
For that.



Which way my Dearest?



Why what does hinder us from making use
(On this occasion) of the secret Door,
By which (you know) you have so often past
Into our House (upon more pleasing Errands?)
By this we shall these Benefits obtain;
Of Safety from your Brothers present Fury,
And time to try if Carlos, and Antonio

May be ingag'd to mediate in this Business.
And I have cause to think you will not find

Antonio so implacable, as you
Imagine.



I conceive you Cozin; Fool that I was,
To think a Heart once Conquer'd by your Eyes
Should e'r become another Virgin's Prize.





So late; a Guest in's House; that's come so far;


On such a Business; and not yet come home?*

There's something in't I cannot comprehend.
I cannot, Madam, yet find out your Brother,
But sure 'twill not be long ere he return.
Then i'l acquaint him with the Accident
Has made his House this Ladie's Sanctuary.




Here is a glympse of comfort, for I see
He takes my Cozin for Don Henrique's Sister;
O bless'd Mistake so luckily continu'd!



I am by his permission Mistris here,
And since that I am pleas'd Sir, 'tis enough,
Without our troubling him with the Account
Of her sad Story.



Yes, Madam, as to th'Excuse, but 'twere fit
He knew it too, that we might serve our selves
Of his Credit in this Ladie's Protection.





Though I did promise the Corrigidor

Not to stir from his House, till his return,
Yet I could not obtain it of my self;
I'm so impatient to unfold the Riddle
Of Don Antonio's seeing of my Sister,
And entertaining her in her own Lodging;
Aside.
I shall not now be long i'th' dark.* O Heavens!
'Tis she her self, and Camilla with her:
Were all my Servants mad, or all agreed
T'abuse me, in affirming she was fled?
But Don Carlos, was he mad too, to swear
That he had trac'd her to an other House?
Certainly I, or they must be Possess'd;
Or some Inchantment reigns within these Walls.



O here comes Don Henrique, I'l now acquaint him
With your sad Story Madam.




I fear we are undone.







I'm dead if he proceed, but how to hinder him 



Here's a Lady with your Sister Porcia 




Yes, Sir, I see who 'tis.



Since you know her Sir, you will the eas'lier
Excuse my boldness.



Boldness, in what Sir?



To have been th' occasion of your finding her
Here, with your Sister, at this time of night.



Lord Sir, what do you mean?



Truly there was a Necessity in it,
Which will, I hope, excuse my Intercession
With you in her behalf.



Now all comes out.



I understand you Sir, she does desire
To pass this night with Porcia, to assist her
In ordering her Nuptial Ceremonies:
Let her stay here a God's name.



If he does not dissemble, my Condition
Is not so desperate as I imagin'd.




I hope you'l pardon this great Liberty;
So early a Confidence will need it, Sir.



'Tis more than enough Sir, that you desire it,
Th'Occasion too does justifie her stay.



'Tis most true Sir, the Occasion did inforce me
Thus boldly to presume upon your Friendship.



Ha' done for Heavens sake, is it a Novelty
Think you for Porcia, and her Cozin-Germin
To pass a Night together?



Is she so near a Kinswoman of his?
Strange Inadvertence in her not to tell me
Her relation to him, when I nam'd him first.
I'd made fine work on't had I told him all.




She knows I owe her many a Good-turn
Upon Octavio's score,* and hope ere long
To be able to repay her to the full.



Can he declare his mind in plainer terms?



I cannot tell which of us two he means,
But I begin to fear that he knows all.



Since 'tis so late, pray give the Ladies leave
To retire to their Chambers; Go in Sister.



My Brothers Words, and his Behaviour
Imply some Mystery; I must be silent
Till I discover more.




Let us begone, w'are lost if we stay here;
I'm confident he counterfeits this Calm
To disguise his Revenge, until Antonio,

And the rest of the House are gone to Bed.



But we shall ne'r be able to get out
Whilst they continue in the outward Rooms.



Yes, by the Garden-dore, but I'm afraid
'Tis shut.



No; now I think on't, Flora went that way,
And left it open.



Come, lett's be gone; I hope Heaven does ordain
Ease by that Door which first let in my Pain.





I'l onely make a step Sir, to my Lodging,
And then return to you immediately.



Pray give me leave to wait on you.



I humbly thank you Sir, I know the way,


And shall not stay above a Moment from you.



Y'are Master here, Sir.



I'l now go see whether my Servant Sancho

Has brought Octavio to my Apartment,
As I directed him.





Heavens! was there ever so strange a Mystery!

Don Carlos he affirm'd that those we fought with
Had convey'd Porcia away, and when I come
To seek her in the House I find her missing,
To second this, her Waiting woman Flora

Tells me that she went down, about that time,
Into th' Garden; Antonio, not long after,
Affirms that he both saw, and entertain'd her
In her own Apartment, where I now find her,
And Camilla with her: What can this be?
These sure are Riddles to pose an Oedipus;

But if by my own Sense I am assur'd
My Honor's safe, which was so much in doubt,
What matter is it how 'tis brought about.




Enter Diego, Flora, and Geraldo accompanying the Chair,
greaping as i' the dark.


DAme Flora, and Signior Diego, go in there.
And you my Friends, set down the Chair i' th'door;
And when the Party's enter'd, pull it to;
'Twill lock of 't self; that done, you may be gone:
There's Mony for you; I'l go fetch a Candle.


Diego, and Flora go in, and the Chair being
set in the door, Octavio goes out into
the room, the Chair-men clap to the door,
and go away.





What!* put in all alone here i' the dark!
And the door shut upon me! Diego, Flora.




Here am I Sir, and Flora too, unless
My Sense of feeling fails me.



I can't conjecture where we are; I durst not


So much as peep out of the Chair, since Flora

Gave me the warning; but where e'r I am,
'Tis better far than in the Serjeants hands.



Though now i'th' dark, I know well where we are:
I have too often walk'd the Streets, Octavio,

From your House hither, upon Cupid's Errants,
Not to know the back door of Carlos's
Apartment; 'tis there I am sure w' are now.



Curse on thee, Flora! had'st thou lost thy wits
Not to let me know it sooner! think'st thou
I should have tamely suffer'd them to bring me,
Like a poor Bird shut in a Cage, t' a place,
Where I must look for nothing but Destruction.



A Gypsie told me by my Palm long since,
A sour-fac'd Damsel should be my destruction.



Suspend a while your Apprehensions, Sir;
You may escape before the Candles come;
The door was wont to open on this side;
If not, I have another way in store.






Flora,* I cannot make the Lock go back.


Ger. unlocks it on the other side, and coming
in with a Candle, meets with Octavio, and
starting back and stumbling lets the Candle
fall, then running out again locks fast the door.


Nay then, i'faith, w'are fast; I heard him give
The Key a double Turn.




Here's a fair Trial for your Maiden breath,

Flora blow 't in again, let's owe your Mouth
More Light, than yet your Eyes could e'r impart.



Light's cast away on such an Owl as you;
But yet I'l trie.





Thanks, gentle Flora, to your Virgin Puff;


But I had rather 't had been let alone:
If I must needs be slain, unless it were
Behind my back, I'd have it i' the dark;
For I hate to be kill'd in my own presence.



What must we do Flora? all my hope's in you.



There is yet room for Hope; there's Back-stairs
Beyond that inner Chamber, that goes down
Into the Garden, if the door be open,
As certainly it is, the way is easie.



Come, let's lose no time; prethee guide us Flora.








As well pleas'd as I am, to find my Honor
Less Desperate than I thought, I cannot rest
Till I have drawn from Porcia a Confession
Of the whole Truth, before she goes to bed;
She's in her Chamber now, unless by new
Enchantments carried thence.

As he is going towards Porcia's Chamber,
Enter Carlos in haste.


I can't imagine what should make Don Henrique

Quit the Corrigidors till we return'd:
One of his Servants tells me he's come home.
O here he is; now shall I raise a storm
Which (if we do not take a special care)
Will scarce b' allaid without a showr of Blood;
Yet I must venture't, since it so imports
Our Friendship, and the Honor of our House.
Aside.
Happiness is a stranger to Mankind,
And like to a Forc'd Motion, it is ever
Strongest at the beginning, then Languishing
With time, grows weary of our company;
But to Misfortunes we so subject are,
That like to Natural motion they prove still
More Vigorous in their Progress.



What means this Philosophical Preamble?



You I'know too soon I fear.




Don Carlos, I am now so well recover'd
From all m'Inquietudes, that for the future
I dare defie the Malice of my Stars
To cause a new Relapse into Distemper.



Cozin, I'm so surpriz'd with this great change,
That my Confusion does suppress my Joy;
But since y'are so much Master of your Passions,
I'l spare my Ethicks, and proceed to give you
In short the Narrative of our success;
The Corrigidor (as we did expect
Forward to serve you in th'Affair I mention'd)
Was pleas'd to go along with me in person,
With a strong Band of Serjeants, to the place,
Where I attended by your Servants led him:
Cozin, 'twas there; it wounds my heart to speak it;
And I conjure you summon all your Patience:
'Twas there I found 



Whom Cozin did you find? for since I'm sure


You found not Parcia there; my Concernments
In your Discoveries are very unlikely
To discompose me.



I would to Heaven we had not found her there.



What's that you say, Cozin, my Sister there!



Yes Sir, your Sister.



My Sister! that's good i'faith: ha, ha, ha.



Why do you laugh? is the Dishonor of
Your Family become a Laughing Matter?
This is a worse Extreme me-thinks than t'other.



How can I choose but Laugh to see you Dream;
Awake for Heavens sake; and recall your Senses;

Porcia there said you?



Yes Sir, Porcia I say; your Sister Porcia;

And which is more, 'twas in Octavio's House.



Why sure y'are not in earnest, Cozin.



As sure as you're alive I sound her there.



Then you transport me, Sir, beyond all patience:
Why Cozin, if she has been still at home,

Antonio seen, and entertain'd her here,
Accompani'd by Camilla; if even now
I left them there within; Is't possible
You should have found her in Octavio's House?
To be here, and there too, at the same time,
None sure but Janus with his double face
Can e'r unfold this Mystery.



Sir, let me advise you; Abuse not your self:
I tell you positively I found her there:
And by the same Token, her Waiting-woman

Flora was there attending her.




Flora! dear Cozin, do not still persist
Thus to affirm impossibilities.



Sure you are making some Experiment
Upon my Temper, and would fain provoke
My Patience to some such high Disorder,
That I should ne'r hereafter have the face
When you are in you Fits to play the Stoick.




Cozin, I swear to you upon my Honor,
'Tis not above a quarter of an hour,
Since I did speak with Porcia, and your Sister
In that very Apartment, and am now
Returning to them in my Sister's Chamber.



And Sir, I swear to you upon my Honor,
'Tis not above a quarter of an hour,
Since I left Porcia carried in a Chair
From Don Octavio's House, your man Geraldo

Conducting the Chair-men to mine, and follow'd
By Flora, whilst I came to find you out


T' acquaint you, Sir, with this unpleasing news:
But fit for you to know as soon might be.



This Question, Cozin, may be soon decided,
Pray come along, her Chamber's not far off.



And my House is but the next door, let's in.



You'l quickly find your Error.
Here comes your Servant, whom I left to Guard her;
He'l instantly convince you of the Truth.









What brings you hither Geraldo?




O Sir, I bring you such rare news, your Enemy,
Your Enemy Octavio  I'm out of breath.



What does the Varlet mean?



Sir, I suppose Don Carlos has inform'd you
That he left me to see your Sister P'rcia,

With Flora, and Diego Octavio's Man
Safely convey'd t'his House.



See now Don Henrique, who was i' the Right.



I did as he commanded me, and put them
All three into Don Carlos's Anti-chamber;

Porcia in the same Chair which brought her thither;
And for more safety made the door be lock'd;
Whilst I went down in haste to fetch a Light.



As sure as Death this Madness is Infectious;
My Man is now in one of Carlos Fits.



Returning with a Light a moment after,
No sooner open'd I the door, but Heavens!
Who should I see there standing just before me
In the same place where I left Porcia, but

Octavio, your Enemy Octavio.




Here is some Witch-craft sure; what can this mean?



Amaz'd at th' sight, I let the Candle fall;
And clapt the door to; then I double-lock'd it,
And brought away the Key.



But how could he get in, if you be sure
You lock'd the door, when you went out for Lights?



I know not whether he was there before,
Or got in after, but of this I'm sure,
That there I have him now, and safe enough.



I am sorry for it.




Let's not, Don Carlos, now perplex our selves
With needless Circumstances, when? and how?
Those Queries are too Flegmatick for me;
If the Beast be i' th'd Toil it is enough;
Let us go seize upon him; he must die.





Good Brother, what unhappy Man is he,
Whom you so positively doom to death?
I have a Sword to serve you in all occasions
Worthy of you, and me.



His intervening, Carlos, is unlucky,
How shall we govern our selves towards him
In this Affair? so unfit for his knowledge?




Antonio is a Man of shining Honor;
But having such a share in this Affront,
If once he know't, I am afraid he'l bring
Fuel, not Water to Don Henrique's Fire.
Aside.

Don Henrique,* you must suddenly resolve
What answer to return, he's not a Man
To be put off with any slight Pretences;
Nor yet to be engag'd in such an Action,
As bears th'appearance rather of Cruelty,
Than Honor, and you know, Antonio needs
No fresh Occasions to support his Name;
 Who Dangers seek, are indigent of Fame.



I find my coming hath disorder'd them,
There's somthing they would fain conceal from me;
All here is discompos'd, what er's the matter.




Perhaps 'twere better to suspend a while
The Execution of your just Revenge:
Time, and mature weighing of Circumstances,
Never did harm in Actions of this Nature;
Where one has still the Party in his Power.



A Curse on your Tame Proposition Carlos!





 He, who the Rules of Temperance neglects,
From a Good Cause may produce Vile Effects.





* I doubt not of your kind Concurrence, Sir,
In all the near Concernments of a Person
Alli'd to you as I am; but Noble Brother,
It were against the Laws of Hospitality,
And Civil Prudence to engage a Guest
(Newly arriv'd after so long a Journey)
In an occasion, Sir, of Blood, and Hazard.



If such be the occasion, I must then
Acquaint you freely, that I wear a Sword,
Which must not be excluded from your Service;
I'm sure you are too Noble t'imploy yours
In any Cause not justifi'd by Ho••r;
But I confess there are Affronts so great,
And heightned by such odious Circumstances,
As do release us from the usual Forms
Of Generous Revenge; and set us free


To tak't on any Advantage.



Though with Regret I see, Sir, I must yield
To your excess of Generosity;
This onely I shall say to satisfie
Your just Reflections; that my Resentments
Are grounded on Affronts of such a Nature,
That as nothing but the Offender's Life
Can e'r repair them, so as to the Forms
Of taking that Revenge, they can't admit
Of the least scruple.



Honor's my Standard; and 'tis true, that I
Had rather Fall, than Blush for Victory;
But you are such a Judge of Honor's Laws▪
That 'twere Injurious to suspect your Cause.
Allow me, Sir, th'honor to lead the way.





If Porcia be there too, (as I believe)
'Twill prove, I fear, a fatal Tragedy;
But should she not be there; yet 'tis too much
For such a Heart as mine, through Ignorance
To have betraid a Gentleman, though Faulty,
In to such Cruel hands; I must go with them;
But so resolv'd, as in this Bloody strife
I'l salve my Honor, or I'l lose my Life.









O the unluckiness! I vow t'you Sir,
I have scarce known that door e'r lock'd before.



There's no Remedy Flora, I am now
At the Mercy of my Enemies.



Having broken into another's Ground,
'Tis just i'faith▪ you should be put i' th' Pound.



The Tide of my ill Fate is swoln so high,
'Twill not admit encrease of Miserie;
Since amongst all the Curses there is none
So wounds the Spirit as Privation.
For 'tis not where we Lie, but whence we Fell,
The Loss of Heaven's the greatest Pain in Hell;
When I had sail'd the doubtful Course of Love,
Had safely gain'd my Port, and far above
My Hopes, the precious Treasure had secur'd,
For which so many Storms I had endur'd;
To be so soon from this great Blessing torn,
That's hard to say, if 'twere first Dead, or •orn,
May doubtless seem such a transcendent Curse,


That even the Fates themselves could do no worse;
Yet this I bore with an erected face,
Since Fortune, not my Fault caus'd my Disgrace;
But now my Eyes unto the Earth are bent,
Conscious of meriting this Punishment,
For trusting a fond Maid's Officious Care,
My Life, and Honor's taken in this Snare;
And thus I perish on this unseen Shelf,
Pursu'd by Fate, and False unto my self.

Flora,* when I am dead, be sure that you
These Tablets give to Porcia; there she'l find,
That to th'Extremest Moment of my Life
I constantly pursu'd those Noble Ways,
Which might Deserve her, though I could not Have her.
Give me the Candle.


Octavio sets the Candle on a Table, and sits
down as to write in his Tablets.


A double Curse upon all Love in earnest,
All Constant Love; 'tis still accompani'd
With strange Disasters; or else ends in that
Which is the worst of all Disasters Marriage.



Sure you could wish that every body living
Had such a Soul of Quick-silver, as yours,
That can fix no where.



Why 'twould not be the worse for you, dear Flora,

You then might hope in time to have your Turn,
As well as those, who have much better Faces.



You, I presume Sir, would be one o'th'latest
Which I should hear of, yet 'tis possible
That one might see you, before you should be welcom.



She has Wit, and good Humor; excellent
Ingredients to pass away the time;
And I have kindness for her Person too,
But that will end with Marriage, and possibly
Her good Humor; for I have seldom known
The Husband, and the Wife make any Musick,
Though when asunder they can play their parts;
Well, friend Diego, I advise you to Look
Before you Leap, for if you should be Coupled
To a Yoak instead of a Yoak-fellow,
'Tis likely you may wear it to your Grave.
Yet, honest Diego, now I think on't better,
Your Dancing, and your Vaulting days are done,
Faith all your Pleasures are three Stories high,
Th'are come up to your Mouth, for you are now
For Ease, and Eating, th'onely Joys of Life,
And there's no Cook, nor Drie-Nurse like a Wife.





I could find Reasons too for Matrimony,
A Stale Maid is a horrible reproach,
I must confess it; and a Waiting-woman
Does onely change a Mistris for a Master;
I may quit her, 'tis true, but not my Husband,
And on the other side she may quit me,
And turn me off, when old, and good for nothing.
A Husband's bound to keep me still; In fine,
For ought I can perceive the Scales are Equal,
I may throw Cross and Pile, which Life I'd have,
The Single Begger, or the Marri'd Slave;
But heark! the Door within, from whence we came
Is newly open'd, or my Ears deceive me.



Methoughts I heard it too, let us peep in.

O Sir,* w'are lost, I see two Female-Giants
Coming most terribly upon us.



Away you troublesome Fool.


the other with a Candle.


I'm confident no body saw us pass
From th'other House.



However, let's go through my Brother's Quarter,
And open the Back-door into the Street;
'Tis good in all Events t'have a Retreat
More ways, than one.



O Heavens!* our surest is cut-off, the Wind
Has clapt that door to thorough which we came.



The Accident's unlucky, 'tis a Spring-lock,
That opens onely on the other side.



Let's on the faster, and make sure of th'other.
Octavio here!


Octavio hearing them starts
up with the Tablets in's hand.



Porcia in this place! may I trust my Senses,
Or does my Fancy create these Chimeras?




Either we Sleep, and Dream extravagantly;
Or else the Fairies govern in this House.




Ah! dearest Mistris, you shall never make me
Quit you so again.



But can that be Octavio?




I was Octavio; but I am at present
So much astonish'd, I am not my self.



What can the meaning of this Vision be?




My dearest Porcia, how is't possible


To find you in this place, noble Antonio

Having so generously undertaken
Your protection?



Did he not yours so too? and yet I find

Octavio here, where he is more expos'd
Than I, to sure destruction; I am loath
To say 'tis he, who has Betraid us both.




Antonio false? it is impossible.



It is too evident.



Peace Slave; he is my Friend, of Noble Blood,
Whose Fame's above the Level of those Tongues,
That Bark by Custom at the brightest Virtues,
As Dogs do at the Moon.



How hard it is for Virtue to suspect.
Ah Octavio! we have been both deceiv'd;
This vile Antonio is the very Man,
To whom my Brother without my Consent,
Or Knowledge has Contracted me in Flanders.





Antonio the Man to whom y'are Contracted,

Porcia the Bride whom he is come to Marry?







Why did you not acquaint me with it sooner?



Alas, I have not seen you since I knew it;
But those Few hours such Wonders have produc'd,
As surpass all Belief, and do require
More time, than your unsafe Condition here
Will allow us to make you understand it.



Dear Friends, I cannot blame your Apprehensions,
Nor your Suspition of Antonio's Friendship:
But I am so possess'd with the Opinion
Of his great Virtue, that I shall as soon
Believe Impossibilities, as his
Apostacie from Honour.



What's her Concernment in Antonio, Porcia?




O, that's the strangest part of our sad Story;
And which requires most time to tell you.

A Blaze of Light appears at the
Window, and a noise within.


See, Flora, at the Window, what's that Light,
And Noise we hear.





O Madam! we are all undone, I see

Henrique, Carlos, and their Servants with Torches
All coming hither, and which is wonderful,

Antonio leading them with his Sword drawn.



Thou dream'st, distracted Wench; Antonio false?
It is impossible.

  63Camilla runs to the Window,
and turning back says,
All she has said is in appearance true,
There's sure some hidden Mystery which thus
Abuses us; for I shall ne'r believe

Antonio can transgress the Rules of Friendship.



Friendship's an Empty Name, made to Deceive
Those, whose Good Nature tempts them to believe;
There's no such thing on Earth, the best that we
Can hope for here is faint Neutrality.



Ye Powers above! what pleasure can ye take
To Persecute Submitting Innocence?



Retire, dear Porcia, to that inner Room,
For should thy cruel Brother find thee here,
He's so revolted from Humanity,
He'l mingle thine, with my Impurer Blood.



That were a kind of Contract; let him come;
We'l meet at once Marriage, and Martyrdom.



Soul of my Life retire.



I will not leave you.



Thou preserv'st me by saving of thy self;
For they can murder onely half of me,
Whilst that my better part survives in thee.



I will die too, Octavio, to maintain,
That different Causes form the same Effects;
'Tis Courage in you Men, Love in our Sex.










You must be rul'd, your Presence will increase
Your Brother's Fury, and Octavio's Danger.



That Argument is Irresistible.

They retire to the other Room, and Octavio
waits on them to the door.


Nay if you are at that,* the Devil take
The hindmost; 'tis for your sake, dearest Flora,

I shun these Honorable Occasions.
Having no Weapon,* Sir, 'tis fit that I
March off with th' Baggage.





I'm now upon the Frontiers of this Life,
There's but one step to Immortality;
And though my cruel fortune has allow'd me
No other Witness of my Tragick end,
But my Inhumane Murtherers; yet my Death
Shall not Disgrace either my Life, or Love;
To th'other World this Honor I will bear,
That as I still have Liv'd, and Lov'd, so I
Encounter Death with the same Constancy.



Enter Antonio, Henrique, Carlos, and Geraldo, with their
Swords drawn, Antonio before the rest.


Where is the Man whose Insolence, and Folly
Has thus misled him to Affront my Friend?



Here is the Man thou seek'st, and he, whom thou
So basely hast Betraid.





Oh Heavens! what is't I see? It is Octavio
My Friend.



Not thy Friend, Antonia; but 'tis Octavio,

Who by thy Perfidie has been betraid▪
To this forlorn Condition; but vile Man,
Thou now shalt pay thy Treachery with thy Life.




Hold Octavio; though thy Injurious Error
May transport thee, it shall not me beyond
The Bounds of Honor; Heaven knows I thought
Of nothing less, than what I find, Octavio





What pause is this, Antonio? all your Fervour
In the Concernments of your Friend, reduc'd
To a tame Parly with our Enimy?
Do all the Promises, you have made to me,
T'assist my just Revenge, conclude in this?



Do all the Promises you have made to me,
T'assist my Virtuous Love, conclude in this?



Where is your wonted Bravery? where your Kindness
To such a near Allie?



Where is your former Honor? where your Firmness
To such an antient Friend?



What course shall my Distracted Honor steer
Betwixt these equal,* opposite Engagements?



What, demur still? nay then I'l right my self.

Henrique makes at Octavio, An∣tonio
turns on Octavio 's side.



Wh'attaques Octavio must pass through me.



I must lay hold on this Occasion.*

Good Cozin, I conjure you to restrain
Your Passion for a while, there does lie hid
Some Mystery in this, which once unfolded,
May possibly produce the Means of making
That Reconcilable, which now seems Desp'rate.



Sweetly propos'd, Sir, an Accommodation?
Think'st thou my Anger's like a Fire of Straw,
Onely to Blaze, and then expire in Smoak?
Think'st thou I can forget my Name, and Nation,
And Barter for Revenge, when Honor Bleeds?
His Life must pay this Insolence, or mine.






Mine must protect his, or else perish with him.



Since neither Faith, nor Friendship can prevail,
'Tis time to trie what proof you are, Antonio,

Against your own near Int•rst; Know, that Man,
Whom you protect against my just Revenge,
Has seconded his Insolence to me
By foul Attempts upon my Sister's Honor;
Your Porcia's Sir, if this will not enflame you.





This Injury's beyond all Sufferance.



To what excess of Folly does our Rage
Transport us Men!* this most Important Secret,
Which Tortures could not have made him discover,
He (onely to advance his blind Revenge)
Has now unforc'd declared to that Person,
From whom, of all men living, he ought most
To have conceal'd it.



How! I attempt your Sister's Honor Henrique?

The Parent of your black Designs, the Devil,
Did ne'r invent a more malicious Falshood;
'Tis true, that I have serv'd the Virtuous Porcia,

With such Devotion, and such Spotless Love,
That, though Unworthy, yet she has been pleas'd
To recompence my Passion with Esteem:
By which, she has so chain'd me to her Service,
That here I vow either to Live her Prize,
Or if I Die, to fall Loves Sacrifice.



O Heavens! what's that I hear? thou blessed Angel
Guardian of Honor, I do now implore
Thy powerful assistance to preserve
That Reputation, which I hitherto
By Virtuous Actions have maintain'd unblemish'd;
In vain, Don Henrique, you design to change
My Resolutions; it must ne'r be said,
That Passion made Antonio recede
From the strict Rules of Honor; Sir, I tell you,
Nothing can make me violate my first
Engagement.



Nay, then thou shalt Die too, Perfidious Man;

Ho! Geraldo, Pedro, Leonido.


and joyn with Henrique, Carlos interposes.


For Heaven's sake, Cozin, draw not on your self
The horrid Infamy of Assasinating
Persons of Noble Blood by Servile Hands.



Do you Defend them too? Kill 'em I say.



Retire Octavio, I'l sustain their shock.








Trust me you must, they will surround us else;
Through that narrow Passage they'l Assail us
With less advantage.

They retire fighting off the Stage: Henrique
and his Men persuing them, and Carlos
endeavouring to stop Don Henrique.



What d'ye give back, ye Men of mighty Fame?




Don Henrique, you shall quickly find 'tis Honor,
Not Fear makes me retire.






Now we shall have a breathing while at least

Octavio, and time to look about us;
Pray see yon other door be fast.


Octavio steps to the door where they went out, and
Henrique bounces at the door they came in at.



Geraldo,* fetch an Iron Bar to force
The door.





Heaven has heard our Prayers; th'are both safe here.



Let's go to 'em Camilla.




'Tis better to stay here a while, and hearken
What Resolution of themselves they take.





So, 'tis now as I could wish.



What do you mean, Generous Antonio?




To Kill thee now my Self, having perform'd
What Pre-engagement did exact from me
In your Defence gainst Others; my Love now
Requires its Dues, as Honor has had his;
There's no Protection for you from my Sword,
But in your Own, or in your frank renouncing
All Claim to Porcia; She is so much mine,
That none must Breath, and have the Vanity
Of a Pretender to her whilst I Live.



My Claims to Porcia I shall ne'r renounce,
But still assert them by all noble ways;
Yet, Sir, this hand shall never use a Sword
(Without the last Compulsion) 'gainst that Man,
Who has so much Oblig'd me; no Antonio,

You are securely Guarded by the Favours,
You have conferr'd upon me.



Sir, let not your pretended Gratitude
Enervate your Defence; 'tis not my custom
To serve my Friends with Prospects of Return;


I therefore, Sir, do freely here acquit you
From all the Obligations, you are pleas'd
To own from me.



You may, Sir, if you please, forbear to add
New Favours to my' account; but you can never
Substract those, which are past; and till that Debt
Be fully paid, I shall not dare t' appear
I'th' Lists against so Generous a Creditor.



Your Scruples are ill grounded; 'twas Octavio

(My antient Friend) whom I design'd to Serve;
Not that Disloyal Man, who has invaded
My Honor, and my Love; 'Tis the Intent
Creates the Obligation, not th' Event.




I call those Powers, who both Discern, and Punish,
To witness for me, that I never knew.
You e'r pretended to Don Henrique's Sister,
Before I came within these fatal Walls:
This I declare, onely to clear my self
From th'Imputation of Disloyalty;
And to prevent the Progress of your Error.



How can I think you should speak Truth to me,
Who am a Witness y'have been False to her,
To whom, you now profess so high Devotion.



I false to Porcia! take heed, Antonio,

So foul an Injury provokes too much;
But, Sir, I must confess I owe you more,
Than the Forgivness of one gross Mistake.



Rare Impudence! I must not trust my Senses.



If we cannot adjust this Competition,
Let us our Fortunes, not our Passions charge
With this our breach of Friendship.



Leave your Discourses, and Defend your self;
Either immediately Renounce all Claims
To Porcia;* or this must speak the rest.



Nay,* then, this must Reply.

They without bounce at the door,
as if they were breaking it open.


Why do I doubt? there is no means to save him
From the present danger, but by another,
Perhaps as great, but something more remote;
I'l do't.

Whilst they fight, Porcia breaks from Camilla,
and unbolis the door, then runs back into her place.
Enter Henrique, Carlos, Leonido, Geraldo,
with their Swords drawn.


What's this! Antonio fighting with Octavio!

This Bravery is excessive, Gallant Friend;


Not to allow a share in your Revenge
T' him, who's most concern'd; he must not die
Without some Marks of mine.


Henrique makes at Octavio, and Antonio
turns to Octavio's side.


Nay, then my Honor you invade anew,
And by Assaulting him, Revive in me
My Pre-engagements of Protecting him
Against all others.



Why were not you Antonio fighting with him?
Were you not doing all you could to Kill him?




Henrique, 'tis true; but finding in my breast
An equal strife 'twixt Honor, and Revenge;
I do in just compliance with themboth
Preserve him from your Rage, to Fall by mine.



Brave Man, how Nicely he does Honor weigh!
Justice her self holds not the Scales more Even.



My Honor suffers more as yet than yours,
And I must have my share in the Revenge;
Either he must renounce all Claims to Porcia,





It is agreed: that he must Doe, or Die:
But by no other hand, than mine.



Cease your Contention, and turn all your Swords
Against this Breast; whilst Porcia' and I have breath,
She must be mine, there's no Divorce but Death.



I'l hear no more, protect him if thou canst



Kill the Slave, kill him, I say.


Henrique makes at him, and Carlos
endeavours to enterpose.


For Heaven's sake hold a Moment; certainly
There's some Mistake lies hidden here, which clear'd,
Might hinder these Extremes.


Henrique and his Servants press
Antonio and Octavio.



These Errors must be clear'd, before they grow
Too fatal, but I fear your Brother's fury
Will not admit of Reason.



I'm sure I'l try, though it should cost my life.














Hear us but speak,





Ha! how came she here?



Did not I tell you that she was brought hither
By my Directions? you would not believe me.



But how then could Octavio come hither?



Nay, that Heaven knows; you heard as well as I
Your Man's Relation.



Ah thou vile Woman! that I could destroy
Thy Memory with thy Life.



Hold,* Sir, that must not be.



What may not I do Justice upon her
Neither?



No Sir; although I have not yet the Honor
To know who she x's, I have this night engag'd
My self, both to Secure, and Serve her.



He knows not Porcia; who was i' the right

Don Henrique, You, or I?



He not know Porcia? whom not an hour since
I saw, and spoke with, entertaining her
In his Apartment; sure we are Enchanted,
And all we see's Illusion.



Allow me, Henrique, to dispell these Charms;
Who is't, Octavio, you pretend to? speak.



You might have spar'd that Question; since none
Knows so well as you, 'Tis Porcia I adore.




Porcia's my Wife;* Disloyal Man thou Di'st.



Hold Sir; which is the Porcia you claim too?



Can you be'n doubt of that? you know too well
The Conquest, that you made so long ago
Of my surprized heart in Flanders.




Conquest! Surpris'd! Flanders! what can this mean?



New Riddles every moment do arise,
And Mysteries are born of Mysteries.



Thanks be to Heaven, our work draws near an end;
Cozin, it belongs to you to finish it.



To free you from that Labyrinth, Antonio,

In which a slight Mistake, not Rectifi'd,
Has involv'd us all; know, th'suppos'd Porcia,

Whom you so long have lov'd, 's the true Camilla.




And you, Don Henrique, know, Octavio

Has always been your Sister's faithful Lover;
And onely Feign'd a Gallantry to me,
His real Passion to Disguise from you.









Brave Antonio, how happy are we both!
Both in our Loves, and Friendships!



Man's Joys do ne'r to their Perfection rise,
Till when by Crosses heightned, they surprize.




* This, my dear Brother, is that brave Commander,
To whom you owe your Life, and Liberty;
And I much more, the safety of my Honor.



Is this the Gallant Leader, who rescu'd us
With so much Valour from th'Enemy's hands?







If you knew him so well, why did not you
Acquaint me with it sooner? 'twas a fault
Camilla.




Alas,* my dearest Brother, Gratitude
Conspiring with the Graces of his Person,
So soon possess'd him of my Heart, that I
Despairing e'r again to see him; and
Asham'd of such a Visionary Love,
Durst never trust my Tongue with my own Thoughts.




Take here from me the Hand of her,* whose Heart
Heaven, and your Merits have long since made yours
Without my Knowledge; may her Virtue pay
Some part of that, which we both owe to yours.



Here with your leave,* and hers I seal the Vows
Of my Eternal Faith unto you both.



But let's take heed, Antonio, lest whilst we
Are Joying in our mutual Happiness,

Don Henrique's scarcely yet compos'd Distemper
Revive not, and Disorder us afresh:
I like not his Grim Posture; you know well
After a Tempest, though the Wind be laid,
There often does remain for a good while
A dangerous Agitation of the Waves;
He must not yet be trusted with himself.



'Tis well thought on, let us go to him.



Here with Respect we wait the Confirmation
Of Heaven's Decrees from your Indulgence,* Sir.
This Lady▪ your Incomparable Sister,
Can witness that I never did invade
Your Passion for Camilla; and Pedro's death
Happen'd by your mistaken Jealousie;
The Causes of your Hate being now remov'd,
'Tis just, Don Henrique, the Effects should cease.



I shall consult my Honor.



You cannot take a better Counsellor
In this Case, than you Own, and Sister's Honor;
What, to secure them both, could have been wish'd
Beyond what Fate hath of it self produc'd?



How hard it is to Act upon Constraint.
That, which I could have Wish'd, I now would Flie;
Since 'tis obtruded by Necessity.



Noble Don Henrique, make account of me
To be as truly yours by this Alliance,
As if a Brother's Name subsisted still.



I must consent,* I see, or worse will follow.

He is a Fool who thinks by Force, or Skill


To turn the Current of a Woman's Will

Since fair Camilla is Antonio's Lot,
I Porcia yield to Don Antonios Friend.
Our Strength, and Wisdom must submit to Fate.
Script of my Love, I will put off my Hate.
Here,* take her hand; and may she make you, Sir,
Happier, than she has done me.




Had such Disorders e'r such a Come-off?
Me-thinks 'twould make a Rare Plot for a Play.*




Faith Flora, I should have the worst of that;
For by the Law of Comedy 'twould be
My Lot to Marry you.



Well thought on, Diego, though spoken in Jest;
We cannot do, I think, a better thing
In Earnest, than to make them Two Joyn Hands.
What say'st thou to it, Flora?




Indeed I have had so many Frights this night,
That I am e'n afraid to lie alone.



Give me thy Hand Flora,* it is a Bargain;
I promise thee, dear Spouse, I'l do my best
To make thee first Repent this Earnest Jeast.



That time shall trie.



Since this last happy Scene is in my House,
You'l make Collation with me are we part.











Sir, you had best make haste, else what you call
Collation, may prove a Breakfast, for 'tis
Near twelve a Clock.



Thus end the Rare Adventures of Five Hours;
As sometimes Boisterous Storm's in Gentle Shours.
