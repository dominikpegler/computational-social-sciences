the god of Greece who deity I raise 
out of the earth give they divinity 
the attribute of sacrifice and prayer 
have give old Homer leave to view the world 
and make his own presentment I be he 
that by my pen give heaven to jupiter 
make Neptune trident calm the curl wave 
give Aeolus lordship over the war wind 
create black haired Pluto king of ghost 
and regent over the kingdom fix below 
by i mar war and fluent Mercury 
speak from my tongue I place divine Apollo 
within the sun bright chariot I make Venus 
goddess of love and to her wing son 
give several arrow tip with gold and lead 
what have not Homer do to make his name 
live to eternity I be the man 
that flourish in the world first infancy 
when it be young and know not how to speak 
I teach it speech and understand both 
even in the cradle o then suffer i 
you that be in the world decrepit age 
when it be near his universal grave 
to sing a old song and in this iron age 
show you the state of the first golden world 
I be the muse patron learning spring 
and you shall once more hear blind Homer sing 

the old Uranus son of the air and day 
be dead and leave behind he two brave son 
Titan and Saturn 
2 Titan be the old 
and shall succeed by the true right of birth 

but Saturn have the heart of all the people 
the kingdom high applause his mother love 
the least of these be step unto a crown 

but how will Titan bear he in these trouble 
be by nature proud and insolent 
to see the young seat in his throne 
and he to who the true right appertain 
by birth and law of nation quite cast off 

that either power or steel must arbitrate 
cause best friend have the best event 
here Saturn come 

behold what nature scant i in year 
and time below my brother your applause 
and general love full supply i with 
and make i to his crown inheritable 
I choose it as my right by gift of heaven 
the people suffrage the dead king bequest 
and your election our fair mother queen 
against all these what can twelve moon of time 
prevail with Titan to disherit we 

the cretan people with shrill acclamation 
pronounce thou sovereign over their land and life 
let Titan storm and threaten strange revenge 
we be resolve thy honour to maintain 

Titan thy ruin shall attempt in vain 
our heart adhere with Vesta our late queen 
accord to our sovereign late bequest 
to kneel to Saturn 

we accept your love 
and we will strive by merit to exceed you 
in just requital of these favour do 

arm lord I hear the voice 
of Titan storm at this strange election 

descend proud upstart trick up in steal weed 
deck in usurp state and borrow honour 
resign they to their owner that be to i 

Titan keep off I charge thou near i not 
lest I thy bold presumption seal with blood 

a crown be worth tug for and I will have it 
though in pursuit I dare my ominous fate 

down with the usurper 

Saturn here shall stand 
immovable uphold by Vesta hand 

be I not elder 

ay but young in brain 
Saturn the crown have cease and he shall reign 

be I a bastard that my heritage 
be wrest from i by a young birth 
have Vesta play the adulteress with some stranger 
if I be elder from Uranus loin 
your maiden issue why be I debar 
the law of nation be I Vesta son 
why do not Vesta then appear a mother 
be young Saturn bed in your womb 
near your heart than I that he be affect 
and I despise if none of these then grant i 
what justice will my interest in the crown 
or if you make i outcast if my mother 
for get the love she owe I shall abandon 
the duty of a son if Saturn prove 
unnatural I will be no more a brother 
but maugre all that have my right withstand 
revenge my wrong and make my way through blood 

Titan we both acknowledge thou a brother 
and Vesta son which we will express in love 
but since for many virtue grow in i 
that have no life in you the queen the peer 
and all the people with loud suffrage 
have shrill their auees high above the cloud 
and style i king we shall forget their love 
not to maintain their strange election 
advise you therefore since this bold adventure 
be much above your strength to arm yourself 
in search of future honour with our love 
for what can Titan do against a people 

Saturn advise well list to his counsel 

if my own land prove thus unnatural 
I will purchase foreign aid 

rather compound 

let Titan make demand of any thing 
save our crown he shall enjoy it free 

Titan your brother offer royal 
accept his love 

to lose a crown include 
the loss of all thing what shall I demand 

This grant he Saturn since thy insinuation 
have wrought he quite out of the cretan heart 
that Titan warlike issue may succeed thou 

Lycaon well advise he during life 
shall reign in peace no interruption 
shall pass from Titan to disturb his reign 
so to our giant race thou will assure 
the crown as due by right inheritance 

to cut off all hostile effusion 
of human blood which by our difference 
must needs be spill upon the barren earth 
we will swear to this accord 

condition thus 
that to deprive all future enmity 
in our succeed issue thy male child 
thou in their cradle strangle 

Kill my son 

or swear to this or all our warlike race 
disperse in several kingdom I will assemble 
to conquer thou and from thy ambitious head 
tear that usurp crown 

Titan thy friendship 
we will buy with our own blood all our male child 
if we hereafter shall have any bear 
shall perish in their birth to this we swear 
as we be king and Saturn 

i the like 
as I be Titan and Uranus son 
this league confirm all my ally I will gather 
search foreign clime in which I will plant my kin 
scorn a seat here where I be despise 
to live a subject to a young birth 
nor bow to that which be my own by due 
Saturn farewell I will leave thou to thy state 
while I in foreign kingdom search my fate 
think on thy oath 

first stay with we and feast 
Titan this day shall be king Saturn guest

your reason 

because you know the proverb a grunt horse and a groan wife never deceive their master say will you make haste nurse 

what be the best news abroad 

the best news abroad be that the queen be likely to keep at home and be it not strange that half a hour be abroad shall make a woman have a month mind to keep in but the worst news be that if the king have a young prince he be tide to kill it by oath but if his majesty go drink to bed and get a girl she have leave to live till she die and die when she can live no long 

that covenant be the most unnatural 
that ever father make one lovely boy 
have feel the rigor of that strict decree 
and if this second likewise be a son 
there be no way but death 

I can tell you more news the king have send to the oracle to know whether my lady be with child of a boy or a girl and what their fortune shall be the lord that go be look for every day to return with his answer it be so gossip in the queen chamber I can tell you o nurse we have the brave king if thou know all 

why I pray thou

you shall no more be lodge beneath the tree 
nor chamber underneath the spread oak 
behold I have devise you form for tool 
to square out timber and perform the art 
of Architecture yet unknown till now 
I will draw you form of city town and tower 
for use and strength behold the model here 

Saturn invention be divine not humane 
a godlike spirit have inspire his reign 

see here a second art of husbandry 
to till the earth to blow to sow to plant 
devise by Saturn here be gold refine 
from gross metal silver brass and tin 
with other mineral extract from earth 
I likewise have find out to make your brook 
river and sea by practice navigable 
behold a form to make your craers and bark 
to pass huge stream in safety dangerless 

Saturn be a God 

the last not least this use of archery 
the string bow and nimblefeatheredshaft 
by this you may command the fly fowl 
and reach she from on high this serve for war 
to strike and wound thy foeman from afar 
what mean this acclamation 

it be thy people 
divine Saturn furnish with these use 
more than the god have lend they by thy mean 
proclaim to thou a last deity 
and will have Saturn honour as a God 

we will study future profit for their use 
and in our fresh invention prove divine 
but god be never touch with my suspire 
passion and throb their godlike issue thrive 
while I unmanlike must destroy my babe 
o my strict oath to Titan which confound 
all my precedent honour one sweet babe 
my young Ops have feel the bloody knife 
and perish in his swath and my queen 
swell with another infant in her womb 
ready to taste like rigor be that lord 
return from Delphos yet 

he be 

admit he now what do the oracle 
speak by the delphian priest 

thus mighty Saturn 
after our ceremonious rite perform 
and sacrifice end with reverence 
a murmur thunder hurry through the temple 
when fall a pleasant shower who silver drop 
fill all the altar with a roseate dew 
in this amazement thus the delphian god 
speak from the incense altar lord of Crete 
thus say to Saturn Sibyl his fair wife 
be great with a young prince of noble hope 
that shall his father virtue much excel 
cease on his crown and drive he down to hell 

the god if there be any above ourself 
envy our greatness and of one that seek 
to bear himself above man make i more wretched 
than the most slavish bruit what shall my sibyl 
bring i a son that shall depose i then 
he shall not I will cross the deity 
I will tomb the usurper in his infant blood 
I will keep my oath prince Titan shall succeed 
maugre the envious god the brat shall bleed 

way for the dowager queen 

how fare our mother 
how be it with fair Sibilla our dear queen 

your queen be deliver 

of some female birth 
you deity I beg make i o heaven 
no more inhuman in the tragic slaughter 
of princely infant fill my decree number 
with virgin though in they I lose my name 
and kingdom either make her barren ever 
or else all generative power and appetite

many degree above murder what be her birth 

she be the sad mother of a second son 

be ever dumb let everlasting silence 
tonguetie the world all humane voice henceforth 
turn to confuse and undistinguished find 
of bark hound hoarse bear and howl wolf 
to stop all rumour that may fill the world 
with Saturn tyranny against his son 

ah do but Saturn see you smile babe 
he will give it life and break ten thousand oath 
rather than suffer the sweet infant die 
his very look will beg a quick reprieve 
even of the tyrant Titan see the uncle 
with what a graceful look the infant smile 
he will give it life although he purchase it with loss of a great kingdom 

then spare the lad I do offend too much 
to kill the first tell Sibyl he shall live 
I will be no more so monstrous in my rigor 
nor with the blood of prince buy my crown 
no more their cradle shall be make their tomb 
nor their soft swath become their wind sheet 
how can my subject think I will spare their life 
that to my own can be so tyrannous 
Tell Sibyl he shall live 

Vesta will be that joyful messenger 

stay let i first reward the oracle 
it tell i Sibyl shall produce a son 
that shall his father virtue much excel 
cease on my crown and drive i down to hell 
must I then give a infanttraitor life 
to sting i to the heart the brat shall bleed

I will do it my lord 

yet stay the lad to kill 
I save my oath and keep my kingdom still 
post after she and charge they on their life 
send i the babe blood in a cup of gold 
a present which I will offer to the god 
delay not be it our mother nay our wife 
forfeit her own to save the infant life 

I shall inform they so 

be this a deity 
to be more wretched than the worst on earth 
to be deprive that comfort of my issue 
which even the base of my land enjoy 
I will henceforth for my rigor hate myself 
pleasure despise and joy abandon quite 
the pure blood that run within my vein 
I will dull with thick and trouble melancholy 
I will war with comfort be at odds with solace 
and league with nothing but distemperature 
henceforth my unkempt lock shall knot in curl

and make we wild in knowledge to the world 
perpetual care shall cabin in my heart 
my tyranny I will punish in myself 
and save the god that labour

None interrupt we single we will contend 
and betwixt we two give these rude faction end 

two royal army then on both side stand

for by thy death I gain the cretan crown 

death be thy due I find it in thy star 
while our high name give period to these war 

never be Saturn deify till now 
nor find that perfectness the god enjoy 
heaven can assure no great happiness 
than I attain in sight of jupiter

and with the hazard of my life preserve 
how well have thou acquit all my travel

that it be but duty that by i be achieve 
only you beauteous lady stand apart 
I know not how to style 

it be Juno and thy sister 

o my star 
you seek to make immortal jupiter 

Juno be only happy in the fortune 
of her renown brother 

royal Saturn

shower down from heaven a largesse that these bridal may exceed mortal pomp march march and leave i 
to contemplate these joy and to devise 
how with best state this night to solemnize 


Saturn at length be happy by his son 
who matchless and unrivalled dignity 
be without peer on earth o joy joy corrosive 
worse than the throw of childbirth or the torture 
of black cimmerian darkness Saturn now 
bethink thou of the Delphian oracle 
he shall his father virtue first excel 
seize Crete and after drive he down to hell 
the first be pass my virtue be exceed 
the last I will prevent by force or treason 
I will work his ruin ere he grow too high 
his star have cast it and the boy shall die

o blind ambition and desire of rain 
what horrid mischief will not thou devise 
the appetite of rule and thirst of reign 
beseek the foolish and corrupt the wise 
behold a king suspicious of his son 
pursue his innocent life and without cause 
o blind ambition what have thou not do 
against religion zeal and nature law 
but man be bear their own fate to pursue 
god will be god and Saturn find it true 
Saturn against his son his force extend 
and will have slay he by his tyrannous hand 
while jupiter alone his life defend 
but when no prayer his fury can withstand 
he use his force his father drive from Crete 
and as the oracle before have tell 
usurp the crown the lord kneel at his foot 
and Saturn fortune be to exile sell 
but leave he of Danae that bright lass 
how amorous jove first wrought she to his power

and how he scale it in a golden shower 
of these we next must speak courteous and wise 
help with your hand for Homer want his eye

to prosecute the virtue of his son 
have seek his own fate and by his ingratitude 
leave to our head the imperial wreath of Crete

nor live she that be worthy our desire 
but we can charm with courtship royal brother 
what news of note be rumour in those realm 
through which you make your travel 

have you hear 
of great Acrisius the brave Argos king 
and of his daughter Danae 

his renown 
and her fair beauty oft have pierce our ear 
nor can we be at peace till we behold 
that face fame have so blaze on what of she 

of her enclosure in the darreine tower 
gird with a triple mure of shine brass 
have you not hear 

but we desire it high 
what marble wall or adamantine gate 
what fort of steel or castle forge from brass 
love can scale or beauty not break through 
discourse the novel neptune 

thus it be 
the queen of Argos go great the king 
send as the custom be to the oracle 
to know what fortune shall betide the babe 
answer be return by Phoebus and his priest 
the queen shall child a daughter beautiful 
who when she grow to year shall then bring forth 
a valiant princely boy yet such a one 
that shall the king his grandsire turn to stone 
Danae be bear and as she grow to ripeness 
so grow her father fear and to prevent 
his ominous fate pronounce by the oracle 
he mould this brazen tower impregnable 
both for the seat and guard yet beautiful 
as be the gorgeous palace of the sun 

ill do Acrisius to contend and war 
against the unchanging fate I will scale that tower 
or rain down million in a golden shower 
I long to be the father of that babe 
beget on Danae that shall prove so brave 
and turn the dotard to his marble grave 
it be cast already fate be thou my guide 
while for this amorous journey I provide 

but be the lady there immure and close 
from all society and sight of man 

so full of jealous fear be king Acrisius 
that save himself no man must near the fort 
only a guard of beldame past their lust 
unsensible of love or amorous pity 
partly by bribe hire partly curb with threat 
be guard unto this bright imprison dame 

too pitiless and too obdure the king 
to cloister beauty from the sight of man 
but this concern not we

though in attempt it be death to fail 
brother and prince all our court rarity 
lie open to your royal entertainment

feast with these prince till our free return 
attendance lord we must descend in gold 
or you imprison beauty never behold 

here be a coil to keep fire and tow asunder I wonder the king shall shut his daughter up so close for any thing I see she have no mind to a man 

content yourself you speak accord to your age and appetite we that be full feed may praise fast we that in our heat of youth have drink our bellyful may deride those that in the heat of their blood be athirst I measure she by what I be not by what I be appetite to love never fail a old woman till crack of nut leave she when Danae have no more tooth in her head then you and I I will trust a man in her company and scarce then for if we examine ourselves we have even at these year qualm and rheum and devise come over our stomach when we but look on a proper man 

that be no question I know it by myself and while I stand centinel I will watch she for that I warrant she 

and have we not reason consider the penalty 

if any stand centinel in her quarter we shall keep quarter here no long if the princess miscarry we shall make gunpowder and they say a old woman be better for that then saltpetre 

the alarm bell ring 
it shall be K Acrisius by the sound of the clapper 

then clap close to the gate and let he in

of cost invaluable so rich a structure 
for beauty or for state the world afford not

the walk within this barricade mure 
full of delight and pleasure for thy taste 
and curious palate all the chief cate 
be from the further verge of the earth 
fetch it to content thou what distaste thou then 

that which alone be better than all these 
my liberty why be I cloister thus 
and keep a prisoner from the sight of man 
what have my innocence and infancy 
deserve to be immure in brazen wall 
can you accuse my faith or modesty 
have any loose demeanour in my carriage 
breed this distrust have my eye play the rioter 
or have my tongue be lavish have my favour 
unvirginlike to any be profuse 
that it shall breed in you such jealousy 
or bring i to this durance 

none of these 
I love my Danae but when I record 
the oracle it breed such fear in i

wherein unto the least of all the god 
have Danae be unthankful or profane 
to bondage i that be a princess free 
and votaress to every deity 

I will tell thou lady the unchanging mouth 
of Phoebus have this oracle pronounce 
that Danae shall in time child such a son 
that shall Acrisius change into a stone 

see your vain fear what less can Phoebus say 
or what have Danae fate deserve in this 
to turn you into stone that be to prepare 
your monument and marble sepulchre 
the meaning be that I a son shall have 
that when you die shall bear you to your grave 
be you not mortal will you ever live 
your father die and to his monument 
you like a mourner do attend his hearse 
what you do to your father let my son 
perform to you prepare your sepulchre 
or shall a stranger bear you to your tomb 
when from your own blood you may store a prince 
to do those sacred right or shall vain fear 
cloister my beauty and consume my year

unto her chamber there to live a anchoress 
and changeless virgin to the period 
of her last hour and you to who this charge

to comprehend our greatness we must add 
Argos and Greece to our dominion 
and all the petty kingdom of the earth 
shall pay their homage unto Saturn son

and forward make for Argos

then set on 
the eagle in our ensign we will display 
jove and his fortune guide we in our way 

whether intend the king this warlike march 

for Argos and Acrisius 

rather guard 
your native confine see upon your coast 
Saturn with thirty thousand trojan land 
and in his aid king Troos and Ganymede 

in never worse time can the tyrant come 
then now to break my faith with Danae 
o beauteous love I fear Acrisius ire 
will with severe censure chastise thou 
and thou will deem i faithless and unkind 
for promisebreach but what we must we must

behold the death we threaten in your cradle 
we come to give you now see here king Troos 
in pity of depose Saturn wrong 
be come in person to chastise your pride 
and be the heaven relentless justicer 

not against Saturn as a father we 
but as a murderer lift our opposite hand 
nature and heaven give we this privilege 
to guard our life against tyrant and invader 
that claim we as we be man we will but live 
then take not from we what you can give 

where have not Saturn fame abroad be spread 
for many use he have give to man 
as navigation tillage archery 
weapon and gold yet you for all these use 
deprive he of his kingdom 

we but save 
our innocent body from the abortive grave 

we be his son let Saturn be content 
to let we keep what heaven and nature lend 

those filial duty you so much forget 
we come to teach you royal king to arm 
give Ganymede the onset of this battle 
that be a son know how to lecture they 
and chastise their transgression 

Ganymede 
it shall be so pour out your spleen and rage 
on our proud issue let the thirsty soil 
of barren Crete quaff their degenerate blood 
and surfeit in their sin all Saturn hope 
and fortune be engage upon this day 
it be our last and all be it our endeavour 
to win it for ay or else to lose it ever 

our trojan be repulse where be Ganymede 

amidst the throng of weapon act wonder 
twice do I call aloud to have he fly 
and twice he swear he have vow this day to die 

let we make up to his rescue 

tush it be vain 
to seek to save he we shall lose ourselves 
the day be lose and Ganymede lose too 
without divine assistance hie my lord

even to the ocean margin we be pursue 
then save yourself by sea 

Crete thou have win 
my thirty thousand soldier and my son 
Come let we to sea 

to sea must Saturn too 
to who all good star be still opposite 
my crown I first buy with my infant blood 
not long enjoy till Titan wrest it 
repurchase and relose by jupiter 
these horrid mischief that have crown our brow 
have breed in we such strange distemperature 
that we be grow deject and forlorn 
our blood be change to ink our hair to quill 
our eye half bury in our queachy plot 
consumption and cold ague have devour 
and eat up all our flesh leave behind 
nought save the image of despair and death 
and Saturn shall to after age be 
that star that shall infuse dull melancholy 
to Italy I will fly and there abide 
till divine power my place above provide 

yield noble trojan there be not in the field 
one of thy nation lift a hand save thou 

why that be my honour when alone I stand 
against thou and all the force of thy land 

I love thy valour and will woo thy friendship 
go free where thou will and ransomless 

why that be no gift I be no prisoner 
and therefore owe no ransom have breath 
know I have vow to yield to none save death 

I wish thou noble trojan and since favour 
can attain thy love I will try conclusion 
and see if I can purchase it with blow 

now speak thou like the noble of my foe 

stand all apart and prince gird we round 

I love he best who stroke can loud sound 

I have thou and will keep thou 

not as prisoner 

a prisoner to my love else thou be free 
my bosom friend for so I honour thou 

I be conquer both by arm and courtesy 

the day be we Troos and K Saturn be flee 
and jupiter remain sole conqueror 

peace with her golden wing hover over Crete 
fright hence discord and remorseless war 
will jupiter make up for Argos now 

winter draw on the sea be unnavigable 
to transport a army there attend without 
a lord of Argos 

bring he to our presence 
how stand it with the beauteous Danae 

as one distress by fate and miserable 
of K Acrisius and his fort of brass 
Danae enclosure and her beldame guard 
who but have hear yet through these brazen wall 
love have break in and make the maid a mother 
of a fair son which when Acrisius hear 
her female guard unto the fire he doom 
his daughter and the infant prince her son 
he put into a mastless boat to sea 
to prove the rigor of the stormy wave 

Acrisius Argos and the world shall know 
jove have be wrong in this her further fortune 
can thou relate 

I can as far as Naples 
the friendly wind her mastless boat transport 
there succour by a courteous fisherman 
she be first relieve and after that present 
to king Pelonnus who at this time reign 
who ravish with her beauty crown her queen 
and deck she with the imperial robe of state 

what we have scant be supply by fate 
here then cease arm and now court amorous peace 
with solemn triumph and dear Ganymede 
be henceforth call the friend of jupiter 
and if the fate hereafter crown our brow 
with divine honour as we hope they shall 
we will style thou by the name of cupbearer 
to fill we heavenly nectar as fair Hebe 
shall do the like to Juno our bright queen 
here end the pride of our mortality 
opinion that make god must style we high 
the next you see we we in state must shine 
eternize with honour more divine 

of Danae Perseus be that night be get 
Perseus that fight with the gorgonian shield 
who fortune to pursue time suffer not 
for that we have prepare a ample field 
likewise how jove with fair Alcmene lie 
of Hercules and of his famous deed 
how Pluto do fair Proserpina betray 
of these my muse now travel next proceed 
yet to keep promise ere we further wade 
the ground of ancient poem you shall see 
and how these first bear mortal god be make 
by virtue of divine poesy 
the fate to who the heathen yield all power 
who doom be write in marble to endure 
have summon Saturn three son to their tower 
to they the three dominion to assure 
of heaven of sea of hell how these be scan 
let none decide but such as understand 
to jupiter do high Olympus fall 
who thunder and the trisulc lightning bear 
dread of all the rest in general 
he on a princely eagle mount the sphere 
neptune be make the lord of all the sea 
his mace a trident and his habit blue 
he can make tempest or the wave appease 
and unto he the seaman be still true 
and for the wind these brother that still war 
shall not disturb his empire the three fate 
bring they to Aeolus chain as they be 
to be enclose in cave with brazen gate 
Pluto make emperor of the ghost below 
where with his black guard he in darkness reign 
command hell where Styx and Lethe flow 
and murderer be hang up in burn chain 
but leave these to your judicial spirit 
I must appeal and to your wont grace 
to know from you what eyeless Homer merit 
who you have power to banish from this place 
but if you send i hence unchecked with fear 
once more I will dare upon this stage to appear
