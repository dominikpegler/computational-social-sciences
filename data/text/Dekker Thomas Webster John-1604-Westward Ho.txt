do you never hear how sir Fabian Scarerow even such another take i up one night before my husband be in wine

have to frequent i and my husband diverse time and at last come he out one morning to my husband and say master tenterhook say he I must trouble you to lend I 200 pound about a commodity which I be to deal in and what be that commodity but his knighthood 

So 

why you shall master scarecrow say my good man so within a little while after master Fabian be create knight 

create a knight that be not good heraldry you must say dub 

and why not create pray 

I well do put he down at his own weapon 

not create why all thing have their be by creation 

yes by my faith be it

I marry mark now 

when he have climb up this costly ladder of preferment he disburse the money back again very honourable come home and be by my husband invite to supper there sup with we beside another gentleman incident to the court one that have bespeak i of my husband to help i into the banquet house and see the revel a young gentleman and that wag our schoolmaster master parenthesis for I remember he say grace methinks I see he yet how he turn up the white of the eye when he come to the last gasp and that he be almost past grace 

nay he can do it 

all supper time my newminted knight make wine the waggon to his meat for it run down his throat so fast that before my chambermaid have take half up he be not scarce able to stand

and he bristle up his beard to rail at she too I cut he over the thumb thus why sir Fabian Searcrow do I incense my husband to lend you so much money upon your bare word and do you backbite my friend and i so our face I think you have have more perseverance if you bear a knightly and a degenerous mind you will scorn it you have wont to be more deformable among woman fie that you will be so humoursome here be nobody so egregious towards you sir Fabian and thus in good sadness I give he the best word I can pick out to make he ashamed of he do 

and how take he this correction 

very heavy for he sleep present upon it and in the morning be the sorry knight and I warrant be so to this day that live by bread in England 

to fee what wine and woman can do the one make a man not to have a word to throw at a dog the other make a man to eat his own word though they be never so filthy 

I see these fiddler can build up their bridge that some music may come over we
