o you quip i cunning for my truantship that I be not at my book today but I have think of that you read last night I assure you 

we doubt it not fair prince lord gentleman give leave 

all void the room there be but scholar and fool 

I hope your excellence can answer i in that axiom of philosophy I propound to you 

I promise you tutor it be a problem to i for the difference of your author opinion make i differ in my own some say omne animale aut homo aut bestia that every live creature be or man or beast 

then a woman be a beast for she be no man 

peace William you will be expulse else and again some author affirm that every beast be fourfooted 

then a fool be no beast for he have but two 

yet again will 

mum Ned no word I will be as still as a small bagpipe 

omne animal est aut homo aut bestia and thus it be prove my lord omne animal est rationalis vel irrationalis homo est rationalis bestia irrationalis 
ergo omne animal homo est vel bestis 
among all the creature in this universe 
or on the earth or fly in the air 
man only reason have other only sense 
so what be only sensual in not man but beast 
for man both sense and reason have 
so every creature have one of these be sure or man or best and though all beast be not fourfooted 

that be certain a louse have six 

I beseech your grace 

a way William 

not a word more as I be William 

for many beast have wing serve in stead of foot and some have horn of which we thus esteem animal cornutum non habet dentes supremas no horn beast have tooth above the roof 

that be a lie a cuckold have 

thrust the fool out of the presence there 

well cedant arma toge the scholar shall have the fool place 

well Cranmer you have make i able to prove a man no beast if he prove not himself so we will now leave this and now resolve i for divinity Cranmer I love you and I love your learning speak and we will hear you 
God give you truth that you may give it i 
this land you know stand waver in her faith 
betwixt the papist and the protestant 
you know we all must die and this flesh 
part with her part of immortality 
tutor I do believe both heaven and hell 
do you know any three place for the soul abode 
call purgatory as some will have i think 
for from my sister marry and her tutor 
I have oft receive letter to that purpose 
I love you Cranmer and shall believe whatever you speak 
therefore I charge you tell the truth 

how think your grace be there a place of purgatory or no 
P Truly I think none yet must I urge to you what be lay 
to i this world you know have be five thousand year 
still increase still decrease still replenish 
how long it will be none know but he that make it 
we all do call our self god child yet sure some be not 
but think you tutor that the compass of that heaven and hell 
be able to contain those soul so numberless 
that ever breathe since the first breath be give 
without a tertium or a three place 
who put these doubt within your graceshead 
be like their own belief slight and unregarded 
and be as easy answer and confute 
quod est infinitum non habet finem 
calum est opus dei opus dei est infinitum 
ergo calum est infinitum 
that which be infinite have no end at all 
for that eternity that everlasting essence 
that do concord heaven earth and hell to be 
be of himself all infinite that heaven and hell be so 
his power his work and word do witness it 
for what be infinite have in it sell noend 
then must the heaven which be his glorious seat 
be incomprehensible contain he 
then what shall need a three place to contain 
a world of infinite so vast and main 

I thank you Cranmer and do believe you 
what other proof have be maintain to i 
or shall be you shall know and aid i in they 
enough for this time who be there doctor tie 
our music lecturer pray draw near indeed I take much 

in music may your grace ever delight delight in you though not in i music be fit for king 
and not for those know not the chime of string 

true I love it yet there be a sort 
seem more pure than wise that will upbraid at it 
call it idle vain and frivolous 

your grace have say indeed they do upbraid 
that term it so and those that do be such 
as in themselves no happy concord hold 
all music jar with they but sound of good 
but will your grace a while be patient 
in music praise thus will I better it 
music be heavenly for in heaven be music 
for there the seraphin do sing continual 
and when the best be bear that ever be man 
a choir of angel sing for joy of it 
what of celestial be reveal to man 
be much of music it be say the beast do worship 
and sing before the deity supernal 
the kingly prophet sing before the ark 
and with his music charm the heart of Saul 
and if the poet sail we not my lord 
the dulcet tongue of music make the stone 
to move irrational beast and bird to dance 
and last the trumpet music shall awake the dead 
and cloth their naked bone in coat of flesh 
to appear in that high house of parliament 
when those that gnash their tooth at music sound 
shall make that place where music never be find 

thou give it perfect life skilful doctor 
I thank thou for the honour praise thou give it 
I pray thou let we hear it too 

it be ready for your grace give breath to your loud tune instrument 

it be well methinks in this sound I prove a complete age 
as music so be man govern by stop 
awe by divide note sometime aloft 
sometime below and when he have attain 
his high and lofty pitch breathe his sharp and most 
shrill air yet at length it be go 
and fall down flat to his conclusion 
another sweetness and harmonious sound 
a mild strain another kind agreement 
yet amongst these many string be one untune 
or jar low or high than his course 
not keep steady mean amongst the rest 
corrupt they all so do bad man the best 

enough let voice now delight his princely care 

doctor I thank you and commend your cunning 
I est have hear my father merry speak 
in your high praise and thus his highness say 
England one God one truth one doctor have 
for music art and that be doctor tie

God bless he and make he fortunate I tell you lord the hope that England have be now in he foregod I think old Harry must leave you short well god will be do here will be old shuffle then ha will there not well you say nothing pray God there be not I like not this difference in religion I god dear lady and I live but seven year long we will take order thorough 

we hear that Luther out of Germanie 
have with a book unto your majesty 
wherein he much repent his former deed 
crave your highness pardon and withal 
submit himself unto your grace pleasure 

Bonner it be true and we have answer it 
blame at first his haughty insolence 
and now his lightness and inconstancy 
that write he know not what so childish 

much bloodshed there be now in Germany 
about this difference in religion 
with lutheran arian and Anabaptis 
as half the province of Helvetia 
be with their tumult almost quite destroy 

methinks it be well my royal sovereign 
your grace the emperor and the christian king 
will call a counsel and peruse the book 
that Luther write against the catholic 
and superstition of the church of Rome 
and if they teach a true way to heaven 
agree with the hebrew testament 
why shall they not be read and follow 

thou say well Kate so they agree with the scripture I think it be lawful to peruse and read they speak bishop 

most unlawful my dear sovereign 
unless permit by his holiness 

How prove you that my lord 

Well say Kate to they again good wench lord give we leave awhile avoid the presence there we will hear the bishop and my queen dispute 

I be a weak scholar my lord 
but on condition that your highness not these reverent lord 
will take no exception at my woman wit 
I be content to hold they argument 
and first with reverence to his majesty 
pray tell i why will you make the king believe 
his highness and the people under he 
be tie so strict to obey the pope 

because fair queen he be god deputy 

so be all king and God himself command 
the king to rule and people to obey 
and both to love and honour he 
but you that be swear servant unto Rome 
how be you faithful subject to the king 
when first you screw the pope then after he 

madam these be that sect of lutheran 
that make your highness so mistake the scripture 
your slender argument thus answer 
before the king God must be must be worship 

it be true but pray you answer this 
suppose the king by proclamation 
command you and every and and and 
pain pain of death and forfeit of his good 
to spurn against the pope authority 
you know the scripture bind you to obey he 
but this I think if that his grace do so 
your slight obedience all the world shall know 

godsmother Kate thou have touch they there 
what say you to that Bonner 

be it to any but her majesty 
these question be confute easy 

pray tell the king then what scripture have you 
to teach religion in a unknown language 
instruct the ignorant to kneel to saint 
by barefoot pilgrimage to visit shrine 
for money to release from purgatory 
the vild villain thief or murderer 
all this the people must believe you can 
such be the dregs of Rome religion 

ay those be the speech of those heretic 
Cranmer Ridley and blunt Lattimer 
that daily rail against his holiness 
fill the land with hateful heresy 

nay be not angry nor mistake they lord 
what they have say or do be mild follow 
as by their article be evident

ha take heed what you say gardener

unless your safety and your life they hate

And see without the knowledge of your grace
