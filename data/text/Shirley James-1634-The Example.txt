in brief to advance my service to 
that lady by your honour testimony 
of what I may deserve I be confident 
I shall reward it by secure her 
fair sister to your wish she be your own 
or if she prove too honest I shall make 
a recompense by offer to your pleasure 
the other who by authority of your breath 
may make i lord of she and her full fortune 
you understand my gracious lord 

I do so 

va your lordship humble creature 

I be your servant 
what shall we do lady but I forget 
I have something more to say to you

because I have observe his nature I will 
give he in brief he be a fellow will 
undo thou in a fortnight though not in 
thy estate yet in thy mind a great mischief 
if thou do marry he it will be policy 
to turn witch betimes ere he sell thou over to shame 
and so much poverty the devil will 
trust thou with a familiar now believe he 
we droop methinks 

So so here be another couple who shall trust 
mankind it will be a miracle to find 
one honest man in the bundle sir you be 
bind to my lord 

his least favour to i 
be more than my whole life can satisfy 
o lady if you know he but as I do 
you will be lose in wonder of his goodness 
above all he be adorer of chaste truth 
and speak religious of any man 
he will not trust obscure tradition 
or faith implicit but conclude of thing 
within his own clear knowledge what he say 
you may believe and pawn your soul upon it 
vouchsafe i kiss your fair hand who least touch 
consent to though I be old and die 
will quicken i into a spring 

you forget my lord the music be prepare 
to dance and warm her blood 

each take his lady 

Falstaffe I will believe thou 
there be no faith in villainous man

give you admittance through my lodging I will excuse 
your absence there be more way to the wood try all 

how much you bless i she shall want no trial 
this opportunity be worth a empire 

what shall I say consent dear lady to 
be i and thou shall taste more happiness 
then woman fierce ambition can pursue 
shift more delight than the warmspring can boast 
variety of leaf or wealthy harvest 
grain from the teem earth joy shall dry all 
thy tear and take his throne up in thy eye 
where it shall sit and bless whatever they shine on 
the night shall sow her pleasure in thy bosom 
and morning shall rise only to salute thou

and seek no further to pollute the stream 
of my chaste thought I will rather choose to die 
poor wife to Peregrine then live a king 
inglorious strumpet can you think my lord 
shall I give up my freedom to your bend 
and for the pride of wealth sell woman in i 
for she must lose that name that once turn whore 
can I arrive at impudence enough 
to come abroad and not be move to hear 
my shame from every tongue but scorn my infamy 
as it be the nature of this sin to strengthen 
itself still with a great can you think 
if no religion can correct your wildness 
another price or pleasure will not buy i 
even from your arm there be no faith in lust 
and she that dare be false to one she love 
will twine with all the world and never blush for it 
kiss and betray as often think on this 
and call yourself home

in thing of this high nature life and honour 
must not be question upon naked fear 
and windy supposition pardon i 
this plainness you imagine I dare fight 

shall I believe it be day when I behold 
the sun disperse his beam about the world 
do I know cold or heat or when I thirst 
shall I be confident we talk together

have my fame lose in the tempest of man tongue 
I have make no reply in point of man 
to your challenge and the noise may be disperse 
nor will what you be please to accept render

So so let we think and talk of something else 
time be precious let we talk wise it will concern we 
my brain be not in tune about my nephew 
who know upon what plot he be send hither 
the dutch be grand projector let we examine 
where he be go now 

my opinion be to kill somebody or other 

that will be know and yet I hear a buzz 
some noble man be aim at we be best 
say nothing and discover he to the state 
we may be else in danger and make accessary 
to the parricide which be not as the vulgar 
interpret kill of a father but 
parem cedendo kill of a peer 
a peer of the land mark that 

I understand a procedendo 
well enough but who shall serve the writ 

under your pardon how can 
you prove he be a murderer let he first kill 
somebody no matter who it be and than you may 
discover he with a safe conscience 

laugh 

what be the matter 

I be of a opinion under correction that if we 
shall discover he we shall not carry it so 
private but it will be know and then we shall 
be in as much danger of the other side for conceal it 

laugh 

who be that 

now I think better on it it can be conceal 
under your favour fellow Oldrat for if we do not 
discover the state will not be so wise as we be 
and then it be pity of their live beside 
if he go on to kill who he list and nobody hear on it 
he may undo the town by degree in a moment 
and neither we nor any that be hurt the wise for it 

laugh again 

who be it laugh 

not I sir ha ha 

nor I sir ha ha 

stand both before i be there not some spirit 
in the room have not some conjurer a plot upon i 
Cato be wise and never laugh but when

and vex their spleen away I will trust

my fame by be silent but as I be 
beneath he in opinion a young man 
circle with expectation of something 
that must declare i worthy of a name 
and love of man I must attempt this danger 
but let i tell thou this which perhaps may 
render thy sword more fatal to i I 
do love thy lady with a sinful purpose 
pursue ever persecute her chaste soul 
to satisfy my wantonness but find 
a innocence so rich in she as may 
alone excuse the ill of all her sex 
nor have the goodness only the effect 
to preserve she but it return my eye 
with so much shame upon myself that I 
throw off my lust and dote on her virtue 
heaven shut his mercy up if I dissemble 
this injust obligation to cherish 
I do reward with trifle which perhaps 
give fuel to your jealousy but know 
I have design a large recompense 
which your sword may confirm to she in few minute

the heir to my estate and she deserve it 
which she will employ no question to assure

nor you if you regard what threaten it 
I must not live upon the charity 
of people tongue their justice shall acknowledge

to inflame thou that thou may be happy 
upon my loss since my last minute give 
thy wife possession of all my fortune 

that rather charm i from each violence 

this must compel you then till now I never 
thought thou ingrateful by thy fame I charge thou 
by thy Bellamia love fight not with pity 
let i be worthy at least to fall with honour 
fight so as howsoever fate determine 
I may get honour though in death and not 
suffer without a wound
