in fashion 
but cry you mercy you have put i in mind 
I do propound a business to you sir 

and I come prepare to answer you 

it be very well I will call one to be a witness 

that be not I remember in our covenant 
you shall need 

I will fetch you a book to swear by 

let it be Venus and Adonis then 
or Ovid wanton elegy Aristotle 
problem guy of Warwick or Sr Beavis 
or if there be a play book you love better 
I will take my oath upon your epilogue 

you be very merry well swear how you please 

in good time 
you do expect now I shall swear I be honest 

yes sir and it be no hard condition 
if you reflect upon my promise 

what 

to marry you which act must make you lord 
of i and my estate a round possession 
some man have go to hell for a less matter 

but I will be damn for twenty thousand 
such as you be and every one a million 
and I the authority of a parliament 
to marry with you all I will not buy 
this flesh now I have swear 

I think so colonel 
bless i twenty thousand wife it will never 
come to my turn and you will not live to give 
the tithe benevolence

then upon the matter 
you be not willing sir to take your oath 
I may be confident you be not honest 

why look upon i lady and consider 
with some discretion what part about i 
do look so tame you shall suspect i honest 
how old do you think I be 

I guess at thirty 

some in the world doubt i not so much 
at thirteen I be ever plump and forward 
my dry nurse swear at seven I kiss like one 
of five and twenty set that aside 
what be my profession 

a soldier 

so examine a whole army and find one 
soldier that hate a handsome woman we can march 
without our bag and baggage and be it possible 
when we come home where woman pride and all 
temptation to wantonness abound 
we shall lose our activity 

you soldier be brave fellow 

when we have our pay

it be out of fashion indeed with gentleman 
to be honest and of age together it be sufficient 
we can provide to take our pleasure too

they will let fall their sting on something else 
this be discourse but when coranto fail 
or news at ordinary when the phlegmatic dutch 
ha take no fisherboat or our coalship land 
safe at Newcastle you be fine gentleman 
but to conclude of that we meet for your honesty 
not justify by a oath as I expect
