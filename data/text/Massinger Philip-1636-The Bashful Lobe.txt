and in presume to direct your master

of arrogance and impertinence 

I have do sir but what my end be 

honest one I know it 
I have my bill of exchange and all provision 
entrust to you you have show yourself 
just and discreet what will you more and yet 
to satisfy in some part your curious care 
hear this and leave i I desire to be 
obscure and as I have demean myself 
these six month pass in Mantua I will continue 
unnoted and unknown and at the best 
appear no more than a gentleman and a stranger 
that travail for his pleasure 

with your pardon 
this hardly will hold weight though I shall swear it 
with your noble friend and brother 

you may tell they 
since you will be my tutor there be a rumor 
almost cry up into a certainty 
of war with Florence and that I be determine 
to see the service whatever I go forth 
heaven prosper my intent I will come home 
a soldier and a good one 

shall you get 
a captain place nay colonel it will add little 
to what you be few of your rank will follow 
that dangerous profession 

it be the noble and monarch honour in it 
but no more on my displeasure 

saint and angel guard you 

a war indeed be threaten nay expect 
from Florence but it be against i already 
proclaim in Mantua I find it here 
no foreign but intestine war I have 
defy myself in give up my reason 
a slave to passion and be lead captive 
before the battle be fight I faint when 
I only see my enemy and yield 
before that I be charge and though defeat 
I dare not sue for mercy like Ixion 
I look on Juno feel my heart turn cinder 
with a invisible fire and yet shall she 
deign to appear clothe in a various cloud 
the majesty of the substance be so sacred 
I dare not clasp the shadow I behold she 
with adoration feast my eye while all 
my other sense starve and oft frequent 
the place which she make happy with her presence 
I never yet have power with tongue or pen 
to move she to compassion or make know 
what it be I languish for yet I must gaze still 
though it increase my flame however I 
much more than fear I be observe and censure 
for bold intrusion walk sad 


know you boy that gentleman 

who monsieur melancholy have not your 
honour mark he before 

I have see he often wait 
about the princess lodging but never guess 
what his design be 

no what a sigh he breathe now 
many such will blow up the roof on my small credit 
there be gunpowder in they 

How crack gunpowder 
he have flesh and blood and devil only carry 
such roar stuff about they you can prove 
he be or spirit or conjurer 

that I grant but he be a lover and that be as bad their sigh 
be like petard and blow all up 

a lover I have be in love myself but never find yet 
that it can work such strange effect 

true madam 
in woman it can for when they miss the enjoy 
of their full wish all their sigh and heighho 
at the worst breed timpany and these be cure too 
with a kiss or two of their saint when he appear 
between a pair of sheet but with we man 
the case be otherwise 

you will be breech boy 
for your physical maxim but how be you assure 
he be a lover 

who I I know with who too 
but that be to be whisper whisper 

how the princess the unparalleled Matilda 
some proof of it I will pay for my intelligence 

let i kiss 
your honour hand it be ever fair but now 
beyond comparison 

I guess the reason 
a give hand be still fair to the receiver 

your ladyship be in the right but to the purpose 
he be my client and pay his fee as due 
as ever usurer do in a bad cause 
to his man of law and yet I get and take they 
both easy and honest all the service 
I do he be to give he notice when 
and where the princess will appear and that 
I hope be not treason if you miss he when 
she go to the vesper or the matin hang i 
or when she take the air be sure to find he 
near her coach at she go forth or come back 
but if she walk he be ravish I have see he smell out 
her footing like a limehound and know it 
from all the rest of her train 

yet I never see he present she a petition 

nor ever shall he only see she sigh and sacrifice 
a tear or two then vanish 

it be most strange 
what a sad aspect he wear but I will make use of it 
the princess be much trouble with the threat 
that come from Florence I will bring she to he 
the novelty may afford her sport and help 
to purge deep melancholy boy can you stay 
your client here for the three part of a hour 
I have some end in it

the present receipt of a round sum of crown 
and that will draw most gallant from their prayer

go she abroad pray tell i

why do you sigh if that you have a business 
to be dispatch in court show ready money 
you shall find those that will prefer it for you 

business can any man have business but 
to see she then admire she and pray for she 
she be compose of goodness for myself 
I find it a degree of happiness 
but to be near she and I think I pay 
a strict religious vow when I behold she 
and that be all my ambition 

I believe you 
yet she be absent you may spend some hour 
with profit and delight too after dinner 
the duke give audience to a rough ambassador 
who yet I never see nor hear his title 
employ from Florence I will help you to a place 
where you shall see and hear all 

it be not worth my observation 

what think you of 
a excellent comedy to be present 
for his entertainment he that pen it be 
the poet of the time and all the lady 
I mean the amorous and learned one 
except the princess will be there to grace it 

what be that to i without her all be nothing 
the light that shine in court Cimmerian darkness 
I will to bed again and there contemplate 
on her perfection 

stay sir see the princess 
beyond our hope 

take that as moor salute 
the rise sun with joyful superstition 
I can fall down and worship o my heart aside 
like Phoebe break through a envious cloud 
or something which no simile can express

with wonder and amazement do possess i 
now glut thyself my famish eye 

that be he an it please your excellence

your excellence have deprive he 
of speech and motion

a personate folly or he a statue 
if it be it be a masterpiece for man 
I can think he 

for your sport vouchsafe he a little conference 

in compassion rather 
for shall he love i as you say though hopeless 
it shall not be return with scorn that be 
a inhumanity which my birth nor honour 
can privilege be they great now I perceive 
he have life and motion in he to who lady 
pay he that duty Galeaz bow offer to go off 

Sans doubt to yourself 

and whither go he now

unfitting you to ask or i to grant

when I presume to look on you

beyond all perfume or Sabean spice 
by one that proud think he merit in it 
I know you love i

on the ambassador and let my daughter 
be present at his audience reach a chair 
we will do all fit respect and pray you put on 
your mild look you be in a place where frown 
be no prevail agent 


I have see 
more than a wolf a Gorgon swoon 

what be the matter 

a page of i be fall into a swoon 
look to he careful 

now when you please the cause that bring you hither 

the protraction 
of my dispatch forget from Lorenzo 
the tuscan duke thus much to you Gonzaga 
the duke of Mantua by i his nephew 
he do salute you fair and entreat 
a word not suitable to his power and greatness 
you will consent to tender that which he 
unwilling must force if contradict 
ambition in a private man a vice 
be in a prince the virtue 

to the purpose these ambage be impertinent 

he demand 
the fair Matilda for I dare not take 
from her perfection in a noble way 
and in create she the comfort of 
his royal bed to raise she to a height 
her flatter hope can not aspire where she 
with wonder shall be gaze upon and live 
the envy of her sex 

suppose this grant 

or if deny what follow 

present war with all extremity the conqueror can 
inflict upon the vanquish 

grant i licence 
to answer this defiance what intelligence 
hold your proud master with the will of heaven 
that ere the uncertain die of war be throw 
he dare assure himself the victory 
be his unjust invade arm of fire 
or those we put on in defence of right 
like chaff to be consume in the encounter 
I look on your dimension and find not 
my own of lesser size the blood that fill 
my vein as hot as you my sword as sharp 
my nerve of equal strength my heart as good 
and confident we have the better cause 
why shall we fear the trial 

you presume you be superior in number we 
lay hold upon the sure anchor virtue 
which when the tempest of the war roar loud 
must prove a strong protection 

two main reason second those you have already hear 
give we encouragement the duty that 
I owe my mother country and the love 
descend to my daughter for the first 
shall I betray her liberty I deserve 
to have my name with infamy raze from 
the catalogue of good prince and I shall 
unnatural forget I be a father 
if like a tartar or for fear or profit 
I shall consign she as a bondwoman 
to be dispose of at another pleasure 
her own consent or favour never sue for 
and i by force exact no Alonzo 
she be my only child my heir and if 
a father eye deceive i not the hand 
of prodigal nature have give so much to she 
as in the former age king will rise up 
in her defence and make her cause their quarrel 
nor can she if that any spark remain 
to kindle a desire to be possess 
of such a beauty in our time want sword 
to guard it safe from violence 

I must speak or I shall burst now to be silent be 
a kind of blasphemy if such purity 
such innocence a abstract of perfection 
the soul of beauty virtue in a word 
a temple of thing sacred shall groan under 
the burden of oppression we may 
accuse the saint and tax the power above we 
of negligence or injustice pardon sir 
a stranger boldness and in your mercy call it 
true zeal not rudeness in a cause like this 
the husbandman will change his ploughingiron 
to weapon of defence and leave the earth 
untilled although a general dearth shall follow 
the student will forswear his book the lawyer 
put off his thrive gown and without pay 
conclude this case be to be fight not plead 
the woman will turn Amazon as their sex 
in she be wrong and boy write down their name 
in the musterbook for soldier 

take my hand 
whatever you be I thank you how be you call 

Hortensio a milanese 

I wish Mantua have many such my lord 
ambassador 
some privacy if you please Manfroy you may 
partake it and advise we they go aside 

do you know friend 
what this man be or of what country 

neither 

I will question he myself what be you sir 

a gentleman 

but if there be gradation 
in gentry as the herald say you have 
be overbold in the presence of your better 

my better sir 

your better as I take it you be no prince 

it be fortune gift you be bear one 
I have not hear that glorious title crown you 
as a reward of virtue it may be 
the first of your house deserve it yet his merit 
you can but faint call your own 

Well answer 

you come up to i 

I will not turn my back 
if you be the duke of Florence though you charge i 
in the head of our troop 

tell i in gentle language 
your passionate speech induce i to think so 
do you love the princess 

be you my enemy 
your foot upon my breast sword at my throat 
even then I will profess it the ascent 
to the height of honour be by art or arm 
and if such a unequalled prize may fall 
on he that do deserve best in defence 
of this rare princess in the day of battle 
I shall lead you a way will make your greatness 
sweat drop of blood to follow 

can your excellence 
hear this without rebuke from one unknown 
be he a rival for a prince 

my lord you take that liberty I never give you 
in justice you shall give encouragement 
to he or any man that free offer 
his life to do i service not deter he 
I give no suffrage to it grant he love i 
as he profess how be you wrong in it 
will you have all man hate i but yourself 
no more of this I pray you if this gentleman 
fight for my freedom in a fit proportion 
to his desert and quality I can 
and will reward he yet give you no cause 
of jealousy or envy 

heavenly lady 

no peace but on such poor and base condition 
we will not buy it at that rate return 
this answer to your master though we wish 
to hold fair quarter with he on such term 
as honour will give way to we be not 
so thunderstruck with the loud voice of war 
as to acknowledge he our lord before 
his sword have make we vassal we long since 
have have intelligence of the unjust gripe 
he purpose to lay on we neither be we 
so unprovide as you think my lord 
he shall not need to seek we we will meet he 
and prove the fortune of a day perhaps 
soon than he expect 

and find repentance when it be too late 
farewell 

no my Matilda 
we must not part so beast and bird of prey 
to their last gasp defend their brood and Florence 
over thy father breast shall march up to thou 
before he force affection the arm 
that thou must put on for we and thyself 
be prayer and pure devotion which will 
be hear Matilda Manfroy to your trust 
we do give up the city and my daughter 
on both keep a strong guard no tear they be ominous 
o my Octavio my try Octavio 
in all my danger now I want thy service 
in passion recompense with banishment 
error of prince who hate virtue when 
she be present with we and in vain admire she 
when she be absent it be too late to think on it 
the wish for time be come princely uberti 
to show your valour friend be to do not talk 
all rhetoric be fruitless only this 
fate can rob you of deserve applause 
whether you win or lose in such a cause 


nor hear of madam 

he have be seek and search for house by house 
nay every nook of the city but to no purpose 

and how he shall escape hence the lord Manfroy 
be so vigilant over the guard appear 
a thing impossible 

I never see he 
since he swoon in the presence when my father 
give audience to the ambassador but I feel 
a sad miss of he on any slight occasion 
he will find out such pretty argument 
to make i sport and with such witty sweetness 
deliver his opinion that I must 
ingenious confess his harmless mirth 
when I be most oppress with care wrought more 
in the remove of it than music on i 

an it please your excellence I have observe he 
waggish witty yet sometime on the sudden 
he will be very pensive and then talk 
so feel of love as if he have 
taste the bitter sweet of it 

he will tell too a pretty tale of a sister that have be 
deceive by her sweetheart and then weep swear 
he wonder how man can be false 

and that when he be a knight he will be the lady champion 
and travel over the world to kill such lover 
as dare play false with their mistress 

I be sure I want his company 
there be letter madam 
in post come from the duke but I be charge 
by the careful bringer not to open they 
but in your presence 

heaven preserve my father 
good news an it be thy will 

patience must arm you against what be ill 

I will hear they in my cabinet 

why have you leave the safety of the city 
and service of the princess to partake 
the danger of the camp and at a time too 
when the army be in view and every minute 
the dreadful charge expect 

you appear so far beyond yourself as you be now 
arm like a soldier though I grant your presence 
be ever gracious that I grow enamour 
of the profession in the horror of it 
there be a kind of majesty 

but too heavy to sit on thy soft shoulder youth retire 
to the duke tent that be guard

to serve you knight adventurer be allow 
their page and I bring a will that shall 
supply my want of power 

to serve i boy I wish believe it that it be in my nerve 
to do thou any service and thou shall 
if I survive the fortune of this day 
be satisfy I be serious 

I be not 
to be put off so sir since you do neglect

this be a triumph for i when I have 
make Florence duke my prisoner and compel he 
to kneel for mercy at her foot 

it be send sir 
to put you in mind who cause it be you fight for 
and as I be her creature to revenge 
a wrong to i do 

by what man

let it suffice I know he by his armour and his horse 
and if we meet I be cut off the alarm 
command i hence sweet youth fall off 

I must not you be too noble to receive a wound 
upon your back and follow close behind you 
I be secure though I can wish my bosom 
be your defence 

thy kindness will undo thou 


we will charge the main battalion fall you 
upon the van preserve your troop entire 
to force the rear he die that break his rank 
till all be we and sure

it be he Ascanio stand 

I never shun 
a single opposition but tell i 
why in the battle of all man thou have 
make choice of i 

look on this youth his cause 
sit on my sword 

I know he not 

I will help your memory fight 

what have I do I be doubtful 
to who to wish the victory for still 
my resolution waver I so love 
the enemy that wrong i that I can 
without repentance wish success to he 
that seek to do i right alas he be fall 
Alonzo fall

power to persuade so far I conjure you 
by she love name I be send from

which you so late desire shall be cut off 
for injury receive beget my wonder 

Alas we foolish spleenful boy will have

by no mean sir I will not save his life 
to rob he of his honour when you give 
give not by half one short word and I follow 
my lord Alonzo if you have receive 
a benefit and will know to who you owe it 
remember what your entertainment be 
at old Octavio house one you call friend 
and how you do return it 

I remember I do not well but it be now no time 
to think upon it my wound honour call 
for reparation I must quench my fury 
for this disgrace in blood and some shall smart for it 

o prince Uberti valour can save we 
the body of our army be pierce and break 
the wing be rout and our scatter troop 
not to be rally up 

it be yet some comfort 
the enemy must say we be not want 
in courage or direction and we may 
accuse the power above we partial when 
a good cause well defend too must suffer 
for want of fortune 

all be lose the duke 
too far engage I fear to be bring off 
three time I do attempt his rescue but 
with odds be beat back only the stranger 
I speak it to my shame still follow he 
cut his way but it be beyond my hope 
that either shall return 

that noble stranger 
who I in my proud vanity of greatness 
as one unknown contemn when I be throw 
out of my saddle by the great duke lance 
horse i again in spite of all that make 
resistance and then whisper in my ear 
fight brave prince uberti there be no way else 
to the fair Matilda favour 

it be do noble 

in you my bosom friend I have call it noble 
but such a courtesy from a rival merit 
the high attribute 

stand on your guard we be pursue 

preserve wonder on wonder

pay your thank Farneze 
to this brave man if I may call he so 
who act be more than humane if thou be 
my better angel from my infancy 
design to guard i like thyself appear 
for sure thou be more than mortal

some prosperous service that have find your favour 
I be lose to myself but lose not you 
the offer opportunity to delude 
the hot pursue enemy these wood 
nor the dark veil of night can conceal you 
if you dwell long here you may rise again 
but I be fall for ever 

Rather bear up 
to the supreme sphere of honour 

I confess my life your gift 

my liberty you have snatch 
the wreath of conquest from the victor head 
and do alone in scorn of Lorenzo fortune 
though we be slave by true heroic valour 
deserve a triumph 

from whence then proceed this poor dejection 

in one suit I will tell you 
which I beseech you grant I love your daughter 
but how as beggar in their wound fancy 
hope to be monarch 
I long languish for she 
but do receive no cordial but what 
despair my rough physician prescribe i 
at length her goodness and compassion find it 
and whereas I expect and with reason 
the distance and disparity consider 
between her birth and i she will contemn i 
the princess give i comfort 

in what measure 

she do admit i for her knight and servant 
and spur i to do something in this battle 
fight for her liberty that may not blemish 
so fair a favour 

This you have perform to the height of admiration 

I subscribe to it that be your rival 

you be charitable 
but how short of my hope nay the assurance 
of those achievement which my love and youth 
already hold accomplish this day fortune 
must sad answer what I do she give i 
the strength to do her piety preserve 
her father and her gratitude for the danger 
you throw yourself into for her defence 
protect you by i her instrument 
but when I come to strike in my own cause 
and to do something so remarkable 
that shall at my return command her thank 
and gracious entertainment then alas 
I faint like a coward I make a vow too 
and it be register never to presume 
to come into her presence if I bring not 
her fear and danger bind in fetter to she 
which now be impossible hark the enemy 
make his approach save yourselves this only 
deliver to her sweetness I have do 
my poor endeavour and pray she not repent 
her goodness to i may you live to serve she 
this loss recover with a happy fate 
and make use of this sword arm I abjure 
and conversation of man I will seek out 
some unfrequented cave and die love martyr

have bear he from my sight 

I suffer for he

we must divide ourselves

a sovereign power over thou or friend with you 
do and dispute not by my example change 
your habit as I thus put off my purple 
ambition die this garment of a shepherd 
leave here by chance will serve in lieu of it 
I leave this to the owner raise new force 
and meet i at S Leo fort my daughter 
as I command Manfroy there will meet we 
the city can hold out we must part 
farewell thy hand 

you still shall have my heart 

the day be we though it cost dear yet it be not 
enough to get a victory if we lose 
the true use of it we have hitherto 
hold back your forward sword and in our fear 
of ambush defer the wish reward 
due to your bloody toil but now give freedom 
nay licence to your fury and revenge 
now glut yourselves with prey let not the night 
nor these thick wood give sanctuary to 
the fearstruck hare our enemy fire these tree 
and force the wretch to forsake their hole 
and offer their scorch body to your sword 
or burn they as a sacrifice to your anger 
who bring gonzaga head or take he prisoner 
which I incline to rather that he may 
be sensible of those torture which I vow 
to inflct upon he for denial of 
his daughter to our bed shall have a blank 
with our hand and signet make authentical 
in which he may write down himself what wealth 
or honour he desire 

the great duke will shall be obey

to make a mutual farewell when a troop 
of the enemy horse fall on we we be force 
to take the wood again but in our flight 
their hot pursuit divide we we have be happy 
if we have die together to survive he 
to i be worse than death and therefore shall not 
embrace the mean of my escape though offer 
when nature give we life she give a burden 
but at our pleasure not to be cast off 
though weary of it and my reason prompt i 
this habit of a florentine which I take 
from a die soldier may keep i unknown 
till opportunity mark i out a way 
for flight and with security 
be there ever such a night of horror 

my friend voice I now 
in part forgive thou fortune

and death in several shape ride here in triumph 
I be like a stag close in a toil my life

why fly thou then what be inevitable 
better to fall with manly wound before 
thy cruel enemy then survive thy honour 
and yet to charge he and die unrevenged 
mere desperation 

heroic spirit 

Mine own life I contemn and will not save it 
but for the future service of the duke 
and safety of his daughter have mean 
if I escape to raise a second army 
and what be near to i to enjoy

Farneze stay thy hasty step Farneze 
thy friend uberti call thou it be in vain

o cruel piety in our equal danger 
to rob thyself of that thou give thy friend 
it must not be I will restore his gift 
and die before he how where shall I find he

and sparkle as in pure gold we be follow 
out of the troop that scour the plain I see 
two gallant horseman break forth who by their 
brave furniture and habiliment for the war 
seem to command the rest spur hard towards we 
see with what wing speed they climb the hill 
like falcon on the stretch to seize the prey 
now they dismount and on their hand and knee 
overcome the deep ascent that guard we from he 
your beauty have betray you for it can 
no more be night when bright Apollo shine 
in our meridian than that be conceal 

it be my curse not blessing fatal to 
my country father and myself why do you

no time to argue that we must descend 
if undiscovered your soft foot unused 
to such rough travail can but carry you 
half a league hence I know a cave which will 
yield we protection 

I wish I can lend you 
part of my speed for i I can outstrip 
Daphne or Atalanta 

some good angel 
defend we and strike blind our hot pursuer 

she can be far off how glorious 
she show to we in the valley 

in my thought 
like to a blaze comet 

bright far 
her beam of beauty make the hill all fire 
from whence remove it be cover with thick cloud 
but we lose time I will take that way 

I this 
it be a degree of comfort in my sorrow 
I have do one good work in reconcile 
Maria long hide in ascanio habit 
to grieve Octavio what a sympathy 
I find in their affection she with tear 
make a free confession of her weakness 
in yield up her honour to Alonzo 
upon his vow to marry she Octavio 
prepare to credit her excuse nay 
to extenuate her guilt she the delinquent 
and judge as it be agree but to i 
the most forlorn of man no beam of comfort 
deign to appear nor can I in my fancy 
fashion a mean to get it to my country 
I be lose for ever and it be impudence 
to think of a return yet this I can 
endure with patience but to be divorce 
from all my joy on earth the happiness 
to look upon the excellence of nature 
that be perfection in himself and need not 
addition or epithet rare Matilda

Felicity crown my labour Gothrio 

here sir 

desire my patient to leave their chamber 
and take fresh air here how have they sleep 

very well sir 
I will we be so rid of they 

why 

I fear one have the art of memory and will 
remember his gold and jewel can you not minister 
a potion of forgetfulness what will gallant 
that be in debt give i for such a receipt 
to pour in their creditor drink 

you shall restore all 
believe it you shall will you please to walk 

will you please to put off 
your holy habit and spice conscience one 
I think infect the other 

I have observe 
compunction in Alonzo he speak little 
but full of retire thought the other be 
jocund and merry no doubt because he have 
the less account to make here 

reverend sir 
I come to wait your pleasure but my friend 
your creature I shall say be so myself 
willing to take far repose entreat 
your patience a few minute 

at his pleasure pray you sit down you be faint still

I thank your goodness but my mind be trouble

your pious habit give i assurance please 
of your skill and power that way that you will 
to be my my mind physician 

sir to that 
my order bind i if you please to unload 
the burden of your conscience I will minister 
such heavenly cordial as I can and set you 
in a path that lead to comfort 

I will open 
my bosom secret to you that I be 
a man of blood be bring up in the war 
and cruel execution my profession 
admit not to be question but in that 
be a subject and bind to obey 
whatever my prince command I have leave 
some shadow of excuse with other crime 
as pride lust gluttony it must be tell 
I be besmear all over 

on repentance mercy will wash it off 

o sir I grant 
these sin be deadly one yet their frequency 
with wicked man make they less dreadful to we 
but I be conscious of one crime with which 
all ill I have commit from my youth 
put in the scale weigh nothing such a crime 
so odious to heaven and man and to 
my sear up conscience so full of horror 
as penance can expiate 

despair not 
it be impious in man to prescribe limit 
to the divine compassion out with it 

Hear then good man and when that I have give you 
the character of it and confess myself 
the wretch that act it you must repent 
the charity you have extend towards i 
not long before these war begin I have 
acquaintance it be not fit I style it friendship 
that be a virtue and not to be blend 
with vicious breach of faith with the lord Octavio 
the minion of his prince and court set off 
with all the pomp and circumstance of greatness 
to this then happy man I offer service 
and with insinuation wrought myself 
into his knowledge grow familiar with he 
ever a welcome guest this noble gentleman 
be bless with one fair daughter so he think 
and bold may believe so for she be 
in all thing excellent without a rival 
till I her father mass of wealth before 
my greedy eye but hoodwink to my honour 
with far more subtle art then perjure Paris 
ere practise on poor credulous Oenone 
besiege her virginfort in a word take it 
no vow or imprecation forget 
with speed to marry she 

perhaps she give you just cause to break those vow 

she cause alas 
her innocence know no guilt but too much favour 
to i unworthy of it it be my baseness 
my foul ingratitude what shall I say more 
the good Octavio no soon fall 
in the displeasure of his prince his state 
confiscate and he force to leave the court 
and she expose to want but all my oath 
and protestation of service to she 
like seem flame raise by enchantment vanish 
this this sit heavy here 

he speak as if 
he be acquaint with my plot you have reason 
to feel compunction for it be most inhuman 
so to betray a maid 

most barbarous 

but do your sorrow for the fact beget 
a aptness in you to make satisfaction 
for the wrong you do she 

gracious heaven a aptness 
it be my only study since I taste 
of your compassion these eye never be close 
but fearful dream cut off my little sleep 
and be awake in my imagination 
her apparition haunt i 

it be mere fancy he stamp 

it be more grave sir nay it be 
now it appear 

where 

do you not see there the glide shadow 
of a fair virgin that be she and wear 
the very garment that adorn she when 
she yield to my crocodile tear a cloud 
of fear and diffidence then so chase away 
her pure white and red as it foretell 
that I shall be disloyal bless shadow 
for it be a sin far far exceed all 
I have commit to hope only that 
thou be a substance look on my true sorrow 
nay soul contrition hear again those vow 
my perjury cancel stamp in brass and never 
to be wear out 

I can endure no more 
action not oath must make i reparation 
I be maria 

can this be 

it be and I Octavio 

wonder on wonder 
how shall I look on you or with what forehead 
desire your pardon 

you true shall deserve it 
in be constant 

if you fall not off 
but look on she in poverty with those eye 
as when she be my heir in expectation 
you think her beautiful 

she be in herself both Indies to i 

stay she shall not come 
a beggar to you my sweet young mistress no 
she shall not want a dower here be white and red 
will ask a jointure but how you shall make her 
be a captain will beget some doubt 
if you shall deal with a lawyer 

I have see this purse 

how the world be give I dare not say to lie 
because you be a soldier you may say as well 
this gold be mark too you be to receive it 
shall never ask how I get it I will run for a priest 
to dispatch the matter you shall not want a ring 
I have one for the purpose now sir I think I be honest 

this ring be Pisano 

I will dissolve this riddle at better leisure 
the wound give to my daughter which in your honour 
you be bind to cure exact our present care 

I be all you sir 

thou have tell too much to give assurance that 
her honour be too far engage to be 
by humane help redeem if thou have give 
thy sad narration this full period 
she be dead I have be happy 

sir these tear 
do well become a father and my eye 
will keep you company as a forlorn lover 
but that the burn fire of my revenge 
dry up those drop of sorrow we once more 
our break force rally up and with 
full number strengthen stand prepare to endure 
a second trial nor let it dismay we 
that we be once again to affront the fury 
of a victorious army their abuse 
of conquest have disarm themselves and call down 
the power above to aid we I have read 
some piece of story yet never find but that 
the general that give way to cruelty 
the profanation of thing sacred rape 
of virgin butchery of infant and 
the massacre in cold blood of reverend age 
against the discipline and law of arm 
do feel the hand of heaven lie heavy on he 
when most secure we have have a late example 
and let we not despair but that in Lorenzo 
it will be second 

you argue well 
and it be a sin in i to contradict you 
yet we must not neglect the mean that be lend we 
to be the minister of justice 

no sir one day give to refresh our weary troop 
tire with a tedious march we will be no long 
coop up but charge the enemy in his trench 
and force he to a battle shout within 

ha how be this 
in such a general time of mourning shout 
and acclamation of joy 
long live the princess long live Matilda within they cry 

Matilda the princess name 
Matilda oft reecho 

what speak thy haste 

more joy and happiness 
then weak word can deliver or strong faith 
almost give credit to the princess live 
I see she kiss her hand 

by who deliver 

that be not to be stall by my report 
this only must be tell as I ride forth 
with some choice troop to make discovery 
where the enemy lie and how entrench a leader 
of the adverse party but unarm and in 
his hand a olivebranch encounter i 
he show the great duke seal that give he power 
to parley with i his desire be that 
assurance for his safety may be grant 
to his royal master who come as a friend 
and not as a enemy to offer to you 
condition of peace I yield to it 
This be return the duke pretorum open 
when sudden in a triumphant chariot 
draw by such soldier of his own as be 
for insolence after victory condemn 
unto this slavish office the fair princess 
appear a wreath of laurel on her head 
her robe majestical their richness far 
above all value as the present age 
contend that a woman pomp shall dim 
the glitter triumph of the Roman Caesar 
I be cut off no canon throat now thunder 
nor fife nor drum beat up a charge choice music 
usher the parent of security long absent peace 

I know not what to think on it 

may it poise the expectation 

thus to meet you 
great duke of Tuscany throw amazement on i 
but to behold my daughter long since mourn for 
and lose even to my hope thus honour by you 
with a excess of comfort overwhelm i 
and yet I can true call myself 
happy in this solemnity till your highness 
vouchsafe to make i understand the motive 
that in this peaceful way have bring you to we 

I must crave licence first for know Gonzaga 
I be subject to another will and can 
nor speak nor do without permission from she 
my curl forehead of late terrible 
to those that do acknowledge i their lord while Lor speak uberti and the rest present themselves to Matilda 
be now as smooth as river when no wind stir 
my frown or smile that kill or save have lose 
their potent awe and sweetness I be transform 
but do not scorn the metamorphosis 
from that fierce thing man hold i I be captive 
and by the unresistable force of beauty 
lead hither as a prisoner be it your pleasure that 
I shall deliver those injunction which 
your absolute command impose upon i 
or deign yourself to speak they 

sir I be 
your property you may use i as you please 
but what be in your power and breast to do 
no orator can dilate so well 

I obey you that I come hither as a enemy 
with hostile arm to the utter ruin of 
your country what I have do make apparent 
that fortune second my will the late 
defeature will make good that I resolve 
to force the sceptre from your hand and make 
your dukedom tributary my surprisal 
of Mantua your metropolis can well witness 
and that I can fear the change of fate 
my army flesh in blood spoil glory conquest 
stand ready to maintain yet I must tell you 
by who I be subdue and what be the ransom 
I be command to lay down 

my lord you humble yourself too much it be fit 
you shall propose and we consent 

forbear 
the article be here subscribe and sign 
by my obedient hand all prisoner 
without a ransom set at liberty 
Mantua to be deliver up the rampire 
ruin in the assault to be repair 
the loss the husbandman receive his crop 
burn up by wanton licence of the soldier 
to be make good with whatsoever else 
you can impose on i if you have be 
the conqueror I your captive 

such a change want a example I must owe this favour 
to the clemency of the old heroic valour 
that spare when it have power to kill a virtue 
bury long since but raise out of the grave 
by you to grace this latter age 

mistake not 
the cause that do produce this good effect 
if as such you receive it it be her beauty 
wrought first on my rough nature but the virtue 
of her fair soul dilate in her converse 
that do confirm it 

mighty sir no more 
you honour she too much that be not worthy 
to be your servant 

I have do and now 
will glad understand that you allow of 
the art cle propound 

do not wrong 
your benefit with such a doubt they be 
so great and high and with such reverence 
to be receive that if I shall profess 
I hold my dukedom from you as your vassal 
or offer up my daughter as you please 
to be dispose of in the point of honour 
and a become gratitude it will not cancel 
the bond I stand engage for but accept 
of that which I can pay my all be you sir 
nor be there any here though I must grant 
some have deserve much from i for so far 
I dare presume but will surrender up 
their interest to that your highness shall 
deign to pretend a title 

I subscribe not to this condition 

the service 
this prince have do your grace in your most danger 
be not to be so slight 

it be far from i 
to urge my merit yet I must maintain 
however my power be less my love be more 
nor will the gracious princess scorn to acknowledge 
I have be her humble servant 

smooth your brow 
I will not encroach upon your right for that be 
once more to force affection a crime 
with which shall I the second time be taint 
I do deserve no favour neither will I 
make use of what be offer by the duke 
however I thank his goodness I will lay by 
my power and though I shall not brook a rival 
what we be well consider I will descend 
to be a three competitor he that can 
with love and service best deserve the garland 
with your consent let he wear it I despair not 
the trial of my fortune 

brave offer and like yourself great prince 

I must profess 
I be so take with it that I know not 
which way to express my service

time to consider will you please to take 
possession of the fort than have taste

who plea will prosper in the court of love 


you need not doubt sir be not peace proclaim 
and celebrate with a general joy 
the high displeasure of the Mantuan duke 
raise on just ground not jealous supposition 
the save of our life which next to heaven 
to you alone be proper will force mercy 
for a offence though capital 

when the conqueror 
use entreaty they be arm command 
the vanquish must not check at 

my piety pay the forfeit 
if danger come but near you I have hear 
my gracious mistress often mention you 
when I serve she as a page and feel 
relate how much the duke her sire repent 
his hasty doom of banishment in his rage 
pronounce against you 

in a private difference 
I grant that innocence be a wall of brass 
and scorn the hot battery but when 
the cause depend between the prince and subject 
it be a unequal competition justice 
must lay her balance by and use her sword 
for his end that protect it I be banish

and that which you call beauty have I be 
of a more low condition I may 
have call my will and faculty my own 
not see that which be to be belove 
with other eye but now ay i most wretched 
and miserable princess in my fortune 
to be too much engage for service do i 
it be impossible to make satisfaction 
to my so many creditor all deserve 
I can keep touch with none 

a sad exordiam 

you love i long and without hope alas 
I die to think on it Parma prince invite 
with a too partial report of what 
I be and may be to he leave his country 
to fight in my defence your brave achievement 
in the war and what you do for i unspeak 
because I will not force the sweetness of 
your modesty to a blush be write here 
and that there may be nothing want to 
sum up my numerous engagement never 
in my hope to be cancel the great duke 
our mortal enemy when my father country 
lie open to his fury and the spoil 
of the victorious army and I bring 
into his power have show himself so 
noble so full of honour temperance 
and all virtue that can set off a prince 
that though I can render he that respect 
I will I be bind in thankfulness to admire he 

it be acknowledge and on your part to be return 

how can I 
without the brand of foul ingratitude 
to you and prince uberti 

hear i madam 
and what your servant shall with zeal deliver 
as a dedalean clew may guide you out of 
this labyrinth of distraction he that love 
his mistress true shall prefer her honour 
and peace of mind above the glut of 
his ravenous appetite he shall affect from she 
but with a fit restraint and not take she 
to give himself he shall make it the height 
of his ambition if it lie in 
his stretch out nerve to effect it though she fly in 
a eminent place to add strength to her wing 
and mount her high though he fall himself 
into the bottomless abyss or else 
the service he offer be not real 
but counterfeit 

what can Hortensio infer from this 

that I stand bind in duty 
though in the act I take my last farewell 
of comfort in this life to sit down willing 
and move my suit no further I confess 
while you be in danger and heaven mercy make i 
it be instrument to preserve you which your goodness 
prize far above the merit I be bold 
to feed my starve affection with false hope 
I may be worthy of you for know madam 
how mean soever I appear in Mantua 
I have in expectation a fortune 
though not possess of it that encourage i 
with confidence to prefer my suit and not 
to fear the prince uberti as my rival 

I ever think he more than what he seem 

pray you forbear 

but when the duke of Florence 
put in his plea in my consideration 
weigh well what he be as you must grant he 
he Mars of man in arm and those put off 
the great example for a kingly courtier 
to imitate annex to these his wealth 
of such a large extent as other monarch 
call he the king of coin and what be above all 
his lawful love with all the happiness 
this life can fancy from he flow to you 
the true affection which I have ever bear you 
do not alone command i to desist 
but as a faithful councillor to advise you 
to meet and welcome that felicity 
which haste to crown your virtue 

we must break off this parley 
Something I have to say 

in tear I thank 
your care of my advancement but I dare not 
follow your council shall such piety 
pass unrewarded such a pure affection 
for any end of i be undervalue 
avert it heaven I will be thy Matilda 
or cease to be no other heat but what 
glow from thy pure flame shall warm this bosom 
nor Florence nor all monarch of the earth

the better 
your part be act give i leave at distance 
to zany it sir on my knee thus prostrate 
before your foot

both wrong myself and you in suffer it 

I will grow here and weep thus turn marble 
unless you hear and grant the first petition

and to your honour and if you deny it 
both way you suffer Remember sir you be not

abuse in make unjust war upon 
a neighbour prince a christian while the Turk 
who scourge and terror you shall be secure 
waste the italian confine it be in you 
to force he to pull in his horn crescent 
and it be expect from you 

I have be in a dream and now begin to wake 

and will you forbear to reap the harvest of such glory 
now ripe and at full growth for the embrace 
of a flight woman or exchange your triumph 
for chamberpleasure melt your able nerve 
that shall with your victorious sword make way 
through the army of your enemy in loose 
and wanton dalliance be yourself great sir 
the thunderbolt of war and scorn to sever 
two heart long since unite your example 
may teach the prince uberti to subscribe 
to that which you allow of 

the same tongue 
that charm my sword out of my hand and throw 
a freeze numbness on my active spirit 
have disenchant i rise fair princess 
and that it may appear I do receive 
your council as inspire from heaven I will 
obey and follow it I be your debtor 
and must confess you have lend my weaken reason 
new strength once more to hold a full command 
over my passion here to the world 
I free do profess that I disclaim 
all interest in you and give up my title 
such as it be to you sir and as far 
as I have power thus join your hand 

to you I add my full consent 

I be lose Farneze 

near to the port than you suppose 
in i our law speak and forbid this contract 

ay i new stop 

shall we be ever cross thus 

there be a act upon record confirm 
by your wise predecessor that no heir 
of Mantua as questionless the princess 
be the undoubted one must be join in marriage 
but where the match may strengthen the estate 
and safety of the dukedom now this gentleman 
however I must style he honourable 
and of a high desert have no power 
to make this good in his alliance stand 
exclude by our law whereas this prince 
of equal merit bring to Mantua 
the power and principality of Parma 
and therefore since the great duke have let fall 
his plea there live no prince that just can 
challenge the princess favour 

be this true sir 

I can contradict it 


there be a ambassador 
from Milan that desire a present audience 
his business be of high consequence 
as he affirm I know he for a man 
of the best rank and quality 

from Milan 

admit he how so low 

I be sorry sir to be the bringer of this heavy news 
but since it must be know 

peace rest with he 
I shall find fit time to mourn his loss 
my faithful servant too Julio 

I be overjoy to see your highness safe 

pray you peruse this 
and there you will find that the objection 
the lord Farneze make be full answer 

the great John Galeas dead 

and this his brother the absolute lord of Milan 

I be revive 

there be no contend against destiny 
I wish both happiness

and seal your pardon on her lip 

Octavio welcome even to my heart rise I shall kneel 
to thou for mercy 

the poor remainder of 
my age shall true serve you 

you resemble a page I have Ascanio 

I be your highness servant still 

all stand amaze 
at this unlooked for meeting but defer 
your several story fortune here have show 
her various power but virtue in the end 
be crown with laurel love have do his part too 
and mutual friendship after bloody jar 
will cure the wound receive in our war
