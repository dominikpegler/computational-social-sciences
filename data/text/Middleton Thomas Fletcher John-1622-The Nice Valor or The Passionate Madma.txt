of the most general inside marry thus far 
I can with boldness speak this one man character 
and upon honour pass it for a true one 
he have that strength of many merit in he 
that it exceed his sovereign power of grace 
he be faithful true to valour that he hate 
the man from Caesar time or far offend 
that ever take disgrace unrevenged 
and if he chance to read his abject story 
he tear his memory out and hold it virtuous 
not to let shame have so much life among we 
there be not such a curious piece of courage 
among man fellowship or one so jealous 
of honour loss or reputation glory 
there be so much perfect of his grow story 

it will make one dote on virtue as you tell it 

I have tell it too much loss believe it coz 

how the duke grace he what be he brother 

do you not yet know he a vainglorious coxcomb 
as proud as he that fall for it 
set but aside his valour no virtue 
which be indeed not fit for any courtier 
and we his fellow be as good as he 
perhaps as capable of favour too 
for one thing or another if it be look into 
give i a man be I a sovereign now

and shift they strange too one while in love 
and that so violent that for want of business 
he will court the very apprentice of a laundress 
though she have kibe heel and in his melancholy again 
he will not brook a empress though thrice fair 
than ever Maud be or high spirit 
than Cleopatra or your english countess

and turn of a hand so angry

his melancholy passion be half spend already 
then come his angry fit at the very tail on it 
then come in my pain gentleman have beat i even to a cullis 
I be nothing right worshipful but very pap 
and jelly I have no bone my body be all one business 
they talk of rib and chine most free abroad in the world 
why I have no such thing whoever live to see i dead 
gentleman shall find i all mummy good to fill gallipot 
and long dildo glass I shall not have a bone to throw 
at a dog 

alas poor vassal how he go 

o gentleman 
I be unjointed do but think of that 
my breast be beat into my maw that what I eat 
I be fain to take it in all at mouth with spoon 
a lamentable hear and it be well know my belly 
be drive into my back 
I earn four crown a month most dear gentleman 
and one he must have when the fit be upon he 
the privy purse allow it and it be thriftiness 
he will break else some forty pound in casement 
and in five hundred year undo the kingdom 
I have cast it up to a quarrel 

there be a fellow kick about court I will 
he have his place brother but for one fit of his indignation 

and sudden I have think upon a mean for it 

I prithee how 

it be but prefer brother 
this stockfish to his service with a letter 
of commendation the same way he wish it 
and than you win his heart for of my knowledge 
he have lay wait this half year for a fellow 
that will be beat and with a safe conscience 
we may commend the carriage of this man in it 
now servant he have keep lusty tall feeder 
but they have beat he and turn themselves away 
now one that will endure be like to stay 
and get good wage of he and the service too 
be ten time mild brother I will not wish it else 
I see the fellow have a sore crush body 
and the more need he have to be kick at ease 

I sweet gentleman a kick of ease send i to such a master 

no more I say we have one for thou a soft footed master 
one that wear wool in his toe 

o gentleman soft garment may you wear 
soft skin may you wed 
but as plump as pillow both for white and red 
and now will I reveal a secret to you 
since you provide for my poor flesh so tender 
have hire mere rogue out of his chamber window 
to beat the soldier monsieur Shamont brother 

that nothing concern we sir 

for no cause gentleman 
unless it be for wear shoulder point 
with long tag than he 

be not that somewhat 
Billakin sir the difference of long tag 
have cost many a man life and advance other some 
come follow i

o every man in his profession 
I know a thump now as judicious 
as the proud he that walk I will except none 
come to a tag how short I fall I be go exeunt 

I have be ruminate with myself 
what honour a man lose by a kick 
why what be a kick the fury of a foot 
who indignation common be stamp 
upon the hinder quarter of a man 
which be a place very unfit for honour 
the world will confess so much 
then what disgrace I pray do that part suffer 
where honour never come I will fain know that 
This be well force and urge may have the power 
to move most gallant to take kick in time 
and spurn out the duello out of the kingdom 
for they that stand upon their honour most 
when they conceive there be no honour lose 
as by a table that I have invent 
for that purpose alone shall appear plain 
which show the vanity of all blow at large 
and with what ease they may be take of all side 
number but twice one the letter patience 
from CP to E I doubt not but in small time 
to see a dissolution of all bloodshed 
if the reform kick do but once get up 
for what a lamentable folly it be 
if we observe it for every little justle 
which be but the nine part of a sound thump 
in our meek computation we must fight forsooth yes 
if kill I be hang if I be kill myself 
I die for it also be not this trim wisdom

for we be so much the ready for our shroud 
for how ridiculous be it to have death come 
and take a fellow pin up like a mistress 
about his neck a ruff like a pinch lantern 
which schoolboy make in winter and his doublet 
so close and pen as if he fear one prison 
will not be strong enough to keep his soul in

with admiration that in you a prince 
shall be so sweet and temperate a condition 
to offer to restore where you may ruin

for which unless you save he he die speedy 
my conscience be discharge I be but a friend

which ought to shine through use or else it lose 
the glorious name it be know by he be my brother

like the wise master and the almanac 
the hundred novel and the book of cookery 
for they begin already to engross it 
and make it a stockbook think indeed 
it will prove too great a benefit and help 
for one that be new set up they know their way
