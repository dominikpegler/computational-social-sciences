who be that 

the duchess secretary 

signior 

your lordship servant 

how do her grace since she leave her mourning 
for the young duke Mendoza who timeless death 
at sea leave she a virgin and a widow 

she be now incline to a second bride 
when be the day of mighty marriage 
to our great cardinal nephew don Columbo 

when they agree they will steal to church 
I guess the ceremony will be loud and public 
your lordship will excuse i 

when they agree alas poor lady she 
dote not upon Columbo when she think 
of the young count D'Alvarez divorce from she 
by the king power 

and counsel of the cardinal to advance 
his nephew to the duchess bed it be not well 

take heed the cardinal hold intelligence 
with every bird in the air 

death on his purple pride 
he govern all and yet Columbo be 
a gallant gentleman 

the darling of the war who victory 
have often court a man of dare 
and most exalt spirit pride in he 
dwell like a ornament where so much honour 
secure his praise 

this be no argument 
he shall usurp and wear Alvarez title 
to the fair duchess man of coarse blood 
will not so tame give this treasure up 

although Columbo name be great in war 
who glorious art and practice be above 
the greatness of Alvarez yet he can 
want soul in who alone survive the virtue 
of many noble ancestor be the last 
of his great family 

it be not safe you will say to wrestle with the king 

more danger if the cardinal be displease 
who sit at helm of state count de Alvarez 
be wise to obey the stream than by 
insist on his privilege to her love 
put both their fate upon a storm 

if wisdom not inborn fear make he compose 
I like it how do the duchess bear herself 

she move by the rapture of another wheel 
that must be obey like some sad passenger 
that look upon the coast his wish fly to 
but be transport by a adverse wind sometime 
a churlish pilot 

she have a sweet and noble nature 

that commend Alvarez Hymen can tie 
a knot of two more equal heart and blood 

Alphonso 

my good lord 

what great affair 
have bring you from the confine 

such as will 
be worth your counsel when the king have read 
my letter from the governor the arragonian 
violate their confederate oath and league 
be now in arm they have not yet march towards we 
but it be not safe to expect if we may timely 
prevent invasion 

dare they be so insolent 

this storm I do foresee 

what have they but the sweetness of the king 
to make a crime 

but how appear the cardinal 
at this news 

not pale although 
he know they have no cause to think he innocent 
as by who counsel they be once surprise 

there be more 
than all our present art can fathom in 
this story and I fear I may conclude 
this flame have breath at home to cherish it 
there be treason in some heart who face be 
smooth to the state 

my lord I take my leave 

your friend good captain 

sweet madam be less thoughtful this obedience 
to passion will destroy the noble frame 
of beauty that this kingdom ever boast

too much of woman in it his eye speak move 
which may excuse his voice and lead away

which natural fall into curl 

prithee no more thou be in love with he

yourself to the devour war no enemy

farewell 

pray give leave to examine a few thought 
expect i in the garden 

we attend 

this be above all expectation happy 
forgive i virtue that I have dissemble 
and witness with i I have not a thought 
to tempt or to betray he but secure 
the promise I first make to love and honour 

the count de Alvarez madam 

admit he 
and let none interrupt we how shall I 
behave my look the guilt of my neglect 
which have no seal from hence will call up blood 
to write upon my cheek the shame and story 
in some red letter 

madam I present 
one that be glad to obey your grace and come 
to know what your command be 

where I once 
do promise love a love that have the power 
and office of a priest to chain my heart 
to you it be injustice to command 

but I can look upon you madam as 
become a servant with as much humility 
in tenderness of your honour and great fortune 
give up when you call back your bounty all that 
be i as I have pride to think they favour 

have love teach thou no more assurance in 
our mutual vow thou can suspect it possible 
I shall revoke a promise make to heaven 
and thou so soon this must arise from some 
distrust of thy own faith 

your grace pardon 
to speak with freedom I be not so old 
in cunning to betray nor young in time 
not to see when and where I be at loss 
and how to bear my fortune and my wound 
which if I look for health must still bleed inward 
a hard and desperate condition 
I be not ignorant your birth and greatness 
have place you to grow up with the king grace 
and jealousy which to remove his power 
have choose a fit object for your beauty 
to shine upon Columbo his great favourite 
I be a man on who but late the king 
have please to cast a beam which be not mean 
to make i proud but wise to direct 
and light i to my safety o dear madam 
I will not call more witness of my love 
if you will let i still give it that name 
than this that I dare make myself a loser 
and to your will give all my blessing up 
preserve your greatness and forget a trifle 
that shall at best when you have draw i up 
but hang about you like a cloud and dim 
the glory you be bear to 

misery 
of birth and state that I can shift into 
a mean blood or find some art to purge 
that part which make my vein unequal yet 
those nice distinction have no place in we 
there be but a shadow difference a title 
thy stock partake as much of noble sap 
as that which feed the root of king and he 
that write a lord have all the essence of 
nobility 

it be not a name that make 
our separation the king displeasure 
hang a portent to fright we and the matter 
that feed this exhalation be the cardinal 
plot to advance his nephew then Columbo 
a man make up for some prodigious act 
be fit to be consider in all three 
there be no character you fix upon 
but have a form of ruin to we both 

then you do look on these with fear 

with eye 
that shall think tear a duty to lament 
your least unkind fate but my youth dare bold 
meet all the tyranny of the star who black 
malevolence but shoot my single tragedy 
you be above the value of many world 
people with such as I be 
〈…〉 if Columbo 
engage to war in his hot thirst of honour 
find out the way to death 

it be possible 

or say no matter by what art or motive 
he give his title up and leave i to 
my own election 

if I then be happy 
to have a name within your thought there can 
be nothing leave to crown i with new blessing 
but I dream thus of heaven and wake to find 
my amorous soul a mockery when the priest 
shall tie you to another and the joy 
of marriage leave no thought at leisure to 
look back upon Alvarez that must wither 
for loss of you yet then I can lose 
so much of what I be once in your favour 
but in a sigh pray still you may live happy 

my heart be in a mist some good star smile 
upon my resolution and direct 
two lover in their chaste embrace to meet 
Columbo bed contain my wind sheet 

I see no face in all this council that 
have one pale fear upon it though we arrive not 
so timely to secure the town which give 
our enemy such triumph 

it be betray 

the wealth of that one city 
will make the enemy glorious 

they dare not plunder it 

they give fair quarter yet 
they only seal up man estate and keep 
possession for the city use they take up 
now ware without security and he 
who single credit will not pass put in 
two lean comrade upon who bond it be not 
religion to deny they 

to repair this 
with honour gentleman 

my opinion be 
to expect a while 

your reason 

till their own 
surfeit betray they for their soldier 
breed up with coarse and common bread will show 
such appetite on the rich cate they find 
they will spare our sword a victory when their own 
riot and luxury destroy they 

that 
will show our patience too like a fear 
with favour of his excellence I think 
the spoil of city take not off the courage 
but double it on soldier beside 
while we have tameness to expect the noise 
of their success and plenty will increase 
their army 

it be considerable we do not 
exceed in foot or horse our muster not 
above sixteen thousand both and the infantry 
raw and not discipline to act 

their heart 
but with a brave thought of their country honour 
will teach they how to fight have they not see 
a sword but we decline our own too much 
the man be forward in their arm and take 
the use with avarice of fame 

colonel 
I do suspect you be a coward 

sir 

or else a traitor take your choice no more 
I call you to a council sir of war 
yet keep your place 

I have wear other name 

deserve they such 
another be enough to unsoul a army 
ignoble talk of patience till they drink 
and reel to death we come to fight and force they 
to mend their pace thou have no honour in thou 
not enough noble blood to make a blush 
for thy tame eloquence 

my lord I know 
my duty to a general yet there be 
some that have know i here sir I desire 
to quit my regiment 

you shall have licence ink and paper 

the general be displease 

how be it Hernando 

the general have find out employment for i

to his mistress 

pray do not trouble i yet prithee speak 
and flatter not thy friend do think I dare 
not draw my sword and use it when cause 
with honour call to action 

with the most valiant man alive 

you will do i some displeasure in your love 
pray to your place 

So 
bear those letter to the king 
it speak my resolution before 
another sun decline to charge the enemy 

a pretty court way 
of dismiss a officer I obey success 
attend your counsel 

if here be any dare not look on danger 
and meet it like a man with scorn of death 
I beg his absence and a coward fear 
consume he to a ghost 

None such here 

or if in all your regiment you find 
one man that do not ask to bleed with honour 
give he a double pay to leave the army 
there be service to be do will call the spirit 
and aid of man 

you give we all new flame 

I be confirm and you must lose no time 
the soldier that be take last night to i 
discover their whole strength and that we have 
a party in the town the river that 
open the city to the west unguarded

the duchess hand how be I shrink in fame 
to be thus play withal she write and counsel 
under my hand to send she back a free

no symptom in her eye or face of anger 
when she give this in charge 

serene as I 
have see the morning rise upon the spring 
no trouble in her breath but such a wind 
as come to kiss and fan the smile flower 

no poetry 

by all the truth in prose 
by honesty and your own honour sir 
I never see she look more calm and gentle 

I be too passionate you must forgive i 
I have find it out the duchess love i dear

it be a device to hasten my return 
love have a thousand art I will answer it 
beyond her expectation and put 
her soul to a noble test your patience gentleman 
the king health will deserve a sacrifice of wine 

I be glad to see this change and thank my wit 
for my redemption 

sir the soldier curse on he love not our master 

and they curse loud enough to be hear 

their curse have the nature of gunpowder 

they do not pray with half the noise 

our general be not well mix 
he he have too great a portion of fire 

his mistress cool he her complexion 
carry some phlegm when they two meet in bed 

a three may follow 

it be much pity 
the young duke live not to take the virgin off 

it be the king act to match two rabbit sucker 

a common trick of state 
the little great man marry travel then 
till both grow up and die when he shall do 
the feat these thing be still unlucky 
on the male side 

This to the duchess fair hand

in the absence of my nephew and be happy 
if you accept my care

worthy your grace person it be because

purchase more honour to prefer his name 
and value to your noble thought mean time

and favour with the king shall be effectual 
to serve your grace 

your own good deed reward you 
till i rise equal to deserve their benefit 
leave i a while 
do not I walk upon the tooth of serpent 
and as I have a charm against their poison 
play with their sting the cardinal be subtle 
who it be not wisdom to incense till I 
hear to what destiny Columbo leave i 
may be the greatness of his soul will scorn 
to own what come with murmur if he can 
interpret i so happy be come 

his excellence salute your grace 

thou have 
a melancholy brow how do he take my letter 

as he will take a blow with so much sense 
of anger his whole soul boil in his face 
and such prodigious flame in both his eye 
as they will be the only seat of fire and at 
each look a salamander leap forth 
not able to endure the furnace 

ha thou do 
describe he with some horror 

Soon as he 
have read again and understand your meaning 
his rage have shoot i with a pistol have not 
I use some soft and penitential language 
to charm the bullet 

wait at some more distance 
my soul do bathe it self in a cold dew 
imagine I be open of a tomb 
thus I throw off the marble to discover 
what antic posture death present in this 
pale monument to fright i 
ha my heart that call my blood and spirit to 
defend it from the invasion of my fear 
must keep a guard about it still lest this 
strange and too mighty joy crush it to nothing 

madam 

bid my steward give thou 
two thousand ducat be sure I be awake 

I shall be able to resolve you madam 
when he have pay the money 

Columbo now be noble 

this be better than I expect if my lady be 
not mad and live to justify her bounty 

the war be leave to he but we must have 
you reconcile if that be all your difference 
his rage flow like a torrent when he meet 
with opposition leave to wrestle with he 
and his hot blood retreat into a calm 
and then he chide his passion you shall back 
with letter from we 

your command be not 
to be dispute 

Alvarez 

lose not 
yourself by cool submission he will find 
his error and the want of such a soldier 

have you see the cardinal 

not yet 

he want no plot 

the king I must obey 
but let the purple gownman place his engine 
in the dark that wound i 

be assure 
of what we can to friend you and the king 
can forget your service 

I be sorry 
for that poor gentleman 

I must confess sir 
the duchess have be please to think i worthy 
her favour and in that degree of honour 
that have oblige my life to make the best 
return of service which be not with bold 
affiance in her love to interpose 
against her happiness and your election 
I love so much her honour I have quit 
all my desire yet will not shrink to bleed 
out my warm stock of life so the last drop 
may benefit her wish 

I shall find 
a compensation for this act Alvarez 
I have much please we 

sir you be the king 
and in that sacred title it be sin 
to doubt a justice all that do concern 
my essence in this world and a great part 
of the other bliss live in you breath 

what intend the duchess 

that will instruct you sir Columbo have 
upon some better choice or discontent 
set my poor soul at freedom 

it be his character 
madam I easy discharge all my pretension 
to your love and person I leave you to your 
own choice and in what you have oblige 
yourself to i resume a power to cancel 
if you please 
this be strange 

now do a act to make 
your chronicle belove and read for ever 

express yourself 

since by divine infusion 
for it be no art can force the general to 
this change second this justice and bestow 
the heart you will have give from i by 
your strict command to love Columbo where 
it be mean by heaven and let your breath return 
who you divorce Alvarez i 

this be but justice sir 

it be decree above 
and since Columbo have release his interest 
which we have wrought he not without some force 
upon your will I give you your own wish 
receive your own Alvarez when you please 
to celebrate your nuptial I invite 
myself your guest 

eternal blessing crown you 

and every joy your marriage 

I know not whether I shall wonder most 
or joy to meet this happiness 

now the king have plant we 
methinks we grow already and twist our love soul 
above the wrath of thunder to divide we 

ha the cardinal 
have meet the king I do not like this conference 
he look with anger this way I expect 
a tempest 

take no notice of his presence 
leave i to meet and answer it if the king 
be firm in his royal word I fear no lightning 
expect i in the garden 

I obey 
but fear a shipwreck on the coast 

madam 

my lord 

the king speak of a letter that have bring 
a riddle in it 

it be easy to interpret 

from my nephew may I deserve the favour 

he look as though his eye will fire the paper 
they be a pair of burn glass and 
his envious blood do give they flame 

what lethargy can thus unspirit he 
I be all wonder do not believe madam 
but that Columbo love be yet more sacred 
to honour and yourself than thus to forfeit 
what I have hear he call the glorious wreath 
to all his merit give he by the king 
from who he take you with more pride than ever 
he come from victory his kiss hang 
yet pant on your lip and he but now 
exchange religious farewell to return 
but with more triumph to be you 

my lord 
you do believe your nephew hand be not 
surprise or strain to this 

strange art and wind in the world most dark 
and subtle progress who bring this letter 

I inquire not his name I think it not 
considerable to take such narrow knowledge 

desert and honour urge it here nor can 
I blame you to be angry yet his person 
oblige you shall have give a noble pause 
before you make your faith and change so violent 
from his know worth into the arm of one 
however fashion to your amorous wish 
not equal to his cheap fame with all 
the gloss of blood and merit 

this comparison 
my good lord cardinal I can think 
flow from a even justice it betray 
you partial where your blood run 

I fear madam 
your own take two much licence and will soon 
fall to the censure of unruly tongue 
because Alvarez have a soft cheek 
can like a woman trim his want on hair 
spend half a day with look in the glass 
to find a posture to present himself 
and bring more effeminacy than man 
or honour to your bed must he supplant he 
take heed the common murmur when it catch 
the scent of a lose fame 

my fame lord cardinal 
it stand upon a innocence as clear 
as the devotion you pay to heaven 
I shall not urge my lord your soft indulgence 
at my next shrift 

you be a fine court lady 

and you shall be a reverend churchman 

one that if you have not throw off modesty 
will counsel you to leave Alvarez 

cause you dare do worse 
than marriage must not I be admit what 
the church and law allow i 

insolent than you dare marry he 

Dare let your contract flame and malice with 
Columbo rage high than that meet we 
when we approach the holy place clasp hand 
in hand we will break through all your force and six 
Oure sacred vow together there 

I know 
when with as chaste a brow you promise fair 
to another you be no dissemble lady 

will all your action have no false light 
about they 

ha 

the people will not talk and curse so loud 

I will have you chide into a blush for this 

begin at home great man there be cause enough

all that be man within i poor Alvarez 
be this thy wedding day 

if you do think there be a heaven or pain 
to punish such black crime in the other world 
let i have swift and such exemplar justice 
as shall become this great assassinate 
you will take off our faith else and if here 
such innocence must bleed and you look on 
poor man that call you god on earth will doubt 
to obey your law nay practise to be devil 
as fear if such monstrous sin go on 
the saint will not be safe in heaven

now to come off be brave 

the masquer sir be flee their horse prepare 
at gate expect to receive they where 
they quick mount come so like friend 
none can suspect their haste which be secure 
by advantage of the night 

I answer for they all it be stake enough 
for many life but if that poniard 
have voice it will convince they be but all 
spectator of my act and now if you 
will give your judgement leave though at the first 
face of this object your cool blood be fright 
I can excuse this deed and call it justice 
a act your honour and your office sir 
be bind to build a law upon for other 
to imitate I have but take his life 
and punish she with mercy who have both 
conspire to kill the soul of all my fame 
read there and read a injury as deep 
in my dishonour as the devil know 
a woman have capacity or malice 
to execute read there how you be cozen sir 
your power affront and my faith her smile 
a juggle witchcraft to betray and make 
my love her horse to stalk withal and catch 
her curl minion 

be it possible 
the duchess can dissemble so and forfeit 
her modesty with you and to we all 
yet I must pity she my nephew have 
be too severe though this affront will call 
a die man from prayer and turn he tiger 
there be nothing dear than our fame 
which if a common man who blood have no 
ingredient of honour labour to 
preserve a soldier by his near tie 
to glory be above all other bind 
to vindicate and yet it may have be less bloody 

charitable devil 

I pray my lord release under your hand what you dare challenge in my love or person as a just forfeit to myself this act will speak you honourable to my thought and when you have conquer thus yourself you may proceed to many victory and after with safety of your famit visit again 
to this your answer be a free resign 

flatter with great opinion of her faith 
and my desert of she with thought that she 
who seem to weep and chide my easy will 
to part with she can not be guilty of 
a treason or apostasy so soon 
but rather mean this a device to make 
i expedite the affair of war I send 
that paper which her wickedness not justice 
apply what I mean trial her divorce 
I love she so I dare call heaven to witness 
I know not whether I love most while she 
with he who crimson penitence I provoke 
conspire my everlasting infamy 
examine but the circumstance 

it be clear 
this match be make at home before she send 
that cunning writ in hope to take he off 
as know his impatient soul will scorn 
to own a blessing come on crutch to he 
it be not well to raise his expectation 
have you sir no affront to ruin he 
with so much scandal and contempt 

we have 
too plentiful a circumstance to accuse 
you madam as the cause of your own sorrow 
but not without a accessary more 
than young Alvarez 

any other instrument 

yes I be guilty with herself and don 
Columbo though our act look several way 
that think a lover may so soon be ransom 
and do exceed the office of a king 
to exercise dominion over heart 
that owe to the prerogative of heaven 
their choice or separation you must therefore 
when you do kneel for justice and revenge 
madam consider i a lateral agent 
in poor Alvarez tragedy 

it be your love to don Columbo sir 

So so the king be charm do you observe 
how to acquit Columbo he will draw 
himself into the plot heaven be this justice 

your judgement be divine in this 

and yet 
Columbo can be secure and we 
just in his pardon that dare make so great 
and insolent a breach of law and duty 

ha will he turn again 

and shall we leave 
this guilt of blood to heaven which cry and strike 
with loud appeal the palace of eternity 
yet here be more to charge Columbo than 
Alvarez blood and bid i punish it 
or be no king 

it be come about my lord 

and if I shall forgive 
his timeless death I can the offence 
that with such boldness strike at i have my 
indulgence to your merit which be great 
make i so cheap your rage can meet no time 
nor place for your revenge but where my eye 
must be affright and affront with 
the bloody execution this contempt 
of majesty transcend my power to pardon 
and you shall feel my anger sir 

thou shall have one short prayer more for that 

have I in the progress of my life 
no action to plead i up deserve 
against this ceremony 

contain yourself 

I must be dumb then where be honour 
and gratitude of king when they forget 
who hand secure their greatness take my head off 
examine then which of your silken lord 
as I have do will throw himself on danger 
like to a float island move in blood 
and where your great desence call he to stand 
a bulwark upon his hold breast to take 
in death that you may live but soldier be 
your valiant fool who when your own security 
be bleed you can cherish but when once 
your state and nerve be knit not think when 
to use their surgery again you cast 
they off and let they hang in dusty armoury 
or make it death to ask for pay 

no more 
we think to have put your victory and merit 
in balance with Alvarez death which while 
our mercy be to judge have be your safety 
but the affront to we make great by 
this boldness to upbraid our royal bounty 
shall tame or make you nothing 

excellent 

the cardinal be not please 

humble yourself 
to the king 

and beg my life let coward do it 
that dare not die I will rather have no head 
than owe it to his charity 

to the castle with he 
madam I leave you to your grief and what 
the king can recompense to your tear or honour 
of your dead lord expect 

This show like justice 

this be the age of wonder 

wondrous mischief 

among those guard which some call tutelar angel 
who office be to govern province 
be there not one will undertake Navarre 
have heaven forsake we quite 

Columbo at large 

And grace now more than ever 

he be not pardon 
that word be prejudicial to his fame 

but as the murder do have be a dream 
vanish to memory he be court as 
preserver of his country with what chain 
of magic do this cardinal hold the king 

what will you say my lord if they inchant 
the duchess now and by some impudent art 
advance a marriage to Columbo yet 

Say I will say no woman can be save nor be it 
fit indeed any shall pretend to heaven 
after one such impiety in their sex 
and yet my faith have be so stagger since 
the king restore Columbo I will be now 
of no religion 

it be not possible 
she can forgive the murder I observe 
her tear 

why so do I my lord 
and if they be not honest it be to be 
half damn to look upon a woman weep 
when do you think the cardinal say his prayer 

I know not 

heaven forgive my want of charity 
but if I be to kill he he shall have 
no time to pray his life can be no sacrifice 
unless his soul go too 

that be too much 

when you mean to dispatch he you may give 
time for confession they have injure i 
after another rate 

you be too passionate cousin 

how the gay man do flutter to congratulate 
his goal delivery there be one honest man 
what pity it be a gallant fellow shall 
depend on knave for his preferment 

except this cruelty upon Alvarez 
Columbo have no mighty stain upon he 
but for his uncle 

if I have a son 
of twelve year old that will not fight with he 
and stake his soul against his cardinal cap 
I will disinherit he time have take a lease 
but for three life I hope a four may see 
honesty walk without a crutch 

this be 
but air and wildness 

I will see the duchess 
you may do well to comfort she 

we must attend the king 

your pleasure 

a man of a brave soul 

the less his safety 
the king and cardinal in consult 

commend we to the duchess and employ 
what language you think fit and powerful 
to reconcile she to some peace my lord

I shall most willing 
a spirit lady will I have she in my closet 
she be excellent company among the lord

I do suspect this fellow will be nibble 
like some who narrow fortune will not rise 
to wear thing when the invention rare and new 
but tread on the heel of pride they hunt 
the fashion when it be cripple like fall tyrant 
I hope I be not old yet I have the honour 
to be salute by our cardinal nephew

I have prevail 
sweet madam use what eloquence you can 
upon she and if ever I be useful 
to your ladyship service your least breath command i

I mean a exile from all happiness 
of this world and almost of heaven for my 
affliction be find out despair 
what will you think of don Columbo 

madam 

who bloody hand wrought all this misery 
will you not weep as I do and wish rather 
a everlasting spring of tear to drown 
your sight than let your eye be curse to see 
the murderer again and glorious 
so careless of his sin that he be make 
fit for new parricide even while his soul 
be purple over and reek with innocent blood 
but do not do not answer i I know 
you have so great a spirit which I want 
the horror of his fact surprise all 
my faculty you will not let he live 
but I poor I must suffer more there be not 
one little star in heaven will look on i 
unless to choose i out the mark on who 
it may shoot down some angry influence 

madam here be don Columbo say he must 
speak with your grace 

but he must not I charge you 
none else wait be this well do 
to triumph in his tyranny speak madam 
speak but your conscience 

sir you must not see she 

not see she be she cable up above 
the search of bullet or of fire be she 
within her grave and that the tough mine 
that ever nature teem and groan withal 
I will force some way to see she do not fear 
I come to court you madam you be not worth 
the humble of my kind thought I come 
to show the man you have provoke and lose 
and tell you what remain of my revenge 
live but never presume again to marry 
I will kill the next at the altar and quench all 
the smile taper with his blood if after 
you dare provoke the priest and heaven so much 
to take another in thy bed I will cut he from 
thy warm embrace and throw his heart to raven 

this will appear a unexampled cruelty 

your pardon madam rage and my revenge 
not perfect take away my eye you be 
a noble lady this not worth your eyebeam 
one of so slight a make and so thin 
a autumn leaf be of too great a value 
to play which shall be soon lose in the air 
be please to own i by some name in your 
assurance I despise to be receive 
there let she witness that I call 
you mistress honour i to make these pearl 
your carcanet 

my lord you be too humble in your thought 

there be no vexation too great to punish she 

now Nadam 

away you saucy fellow madam I 
must be excuse if I do think more honourable 
than you have cause of this great lord 

why be not 
all woman kind concern to hate what be impious 

for my part 

Antonio be this a woman 

I know not whether she be man or woman 
I shall be nimble to find out the experiment 
she look with less state when Columbo come 

let i entreat your absence I be cozen in she 
I take you for a modest honest lady 

madam I scorn any accuser and 
deduct the great title of a duchess 
I shall not need one grain of your dear honour 
to make i full weight if your grace be jealous 
I can remove 

she be go 

prithee remove 
my fear of her return she be not worth 
consider my anger be mount high 
he need not put in caution for my next 
marriage Alvarez I must come to thou 
thy virgin wife and widow but not till 
I have pay those tragic duty to thy hearse 
become my piety and love but how 
who shall instruct a way 

madam don 
Hernando much desire to speak with you 

will not thy own discretion think I be 
unfit for visit 

please your grace he bring 
something he say import your ear and love 
of the dead lord Alvarez 

then admit he 

I will speak madam to yourself 

your absence 

I know not how you grace will censure so 
much boldness when you know the affair I come for 

my servant have prepare i to receive it 
if it concern my dead lord 

can you name 
so much of your Alvarez in a breath 
without one word of your revenge o madam 
I come to chide you and repent my great 
opinion of your virtue that can walk 
and spend so many hour in naked solitude 
as if you think that no arrear be due 
to his death when you have pay his funeral charge 
make your eye red and weep a handkerchief 
I come to tell you that I see he bleed 
ay that can challenge nothing in his name 
and honour see his murder body warm 
and pant with the labour of his spirit 
till my amaze soul shrink and hide itself 
while barbarous Columbo grin stand 
and mock the weep wound it be too much 
that you shall keep your heart alive so long 
after this spectacle and not revenge it 

you do not know the business of my heart 
that censure i so rash yet I thank you 
and if you be Alvarez friend dare tell 
your confidence that I despise my life 
but know not how to use it in a service 
to speak i his revenger this will need 
no other proof than that to you who may 
be send with cunning to betray i I 
have make this bold confession I so much 
desire to sacrifice to that hover ghost 
Columbo life that I be not ambitious 
to keep my own two minute after it 

if you will call i coward which be equal 
to think I be a traitor I forgive it 
for this brave resolution which time 
and all the destiny must aid I beg 
that I may kiss your hand for this and may 
the soul of angry honour guide it 

whither 

to don Columbo heart 

it be too weak I fear alone 

alone be you in earnest why will it not 
be a dishonour to your justice madam 
another arm shall interpose but that 
it be a saucy act to mingle with you 
I dare nay I be bind in the revenge 
of he that be dead since the whole world have interest 
in every goodman loss to offer it 
dare you command i madam 

not command 
but I shall more than honour such a truth 
in man that dare against so mighty odds 
appear Alvarez friend and i the cardinal 

be for the second course Columbo must 
be first cut up his ghost must lead the dance 
let he die first 

but how 

how with a sword and if I undertake it 
I will lose so much of my own honour 
to kill he base 

how shall I reward 
this infinite service it be not modesty 
while now my husband groan beneath his tomb 
and call i to his marble bed to promise 
what this great act may well deserve myself 
if you survive the victor but if thus 
Alvarez ash be appease it must 
deserve a honourable memory 
and though Columbo as he have all power 
and grasp the fate have vow to kill the man 
that shall succeed Alvarez 

tyranny 

yet if ever 
I entertain a thought of love hereafter 
Hernando from the world shall challenge it 
till when my prayer and fortune shall wait on you 

this be too mighty recompense 

it be all just 

if I outlive Columbo I must not 
expect security at home 

thou can 
not fly where all my fortune and my love 
shall not attend to guard thou 

if I die 

thy memory 
shall have a shrine the next within my heart 
to my Alvarez 

once again your hand 
your cause be so religious you need 
not strengthen it with your prayer trust it to i 

madam the cardinal 

will you appear 

and he have all the horror of the devil 
in his face I will not balk he 

what make Hernando here I do not like 
they shall consult I will take no note the king 
fair salute your grace by who command 
I be to tell you though his will and action 
illimited stoop not to satisfy 
the vulgar inquisition he be 
yet willing to retain a just opinion 
with those that be place near he and although 
you look with nature eye upon yourself 
which need no perspective to reach nor art 
of any optic to make great what 
your narrow sense apply a injury 
our self still near to ourselves but there be 
another eye that look abroad and walk 
in search of reason and the weight of thing 
with which if you look on he you will find 
his pardon to Columbo can be 
so much against his justice as your err 
faith will persuade your anger 

good my lord 
your phrase have too much landscape and I can 
distinguish at this distance you present 
the figure perfect but indeed my eye 
may pray your lordship find excuse for tear 
have almost make they blind 

fair peace restore they 
to bring the object near the king say 
he can not be severe to don Columbo 
without injustice to his other merit 
which call more loud for their reward and honour 
than you for your revenge the kingdom make 
happy by those you only by the last 
unfortunate nor be it rational 
I speak the king own language he shall die 
for take one man breath without who valour 
none now have be alive without dishonour 

in my poor understanding it be the crown 
of virtue to proceed in its own tract 
not deviate from honour if you acquit 
a man of murder because he have do brave 
thing in the war you will bring down his valour 
to a crime nay to a bawd if it secure 
a rape and but teach those that deserve well 
to sin with great licence but dispute 
be now too late my lord it be do and you 
by the good king in tender of my sorrow 
send to persuade i it be unreasonable 
that justice shall repair i 

you mistake 
for if Columbo death can make Alvarez 
live the king have give he up to law 
your bleed sacrifice but when his life 
be but another treasure throw away 
to obey a clamorous statute it be wisdom 
to himself and common safety to take off 
this kill edge of law and keep Columbo 
to recompense the crime by noble act 
and sorrow that in time may draw your pity 

this be a great tyranny than that 
Columbo exercise he kill my lord 
and you not have the charity to let 
i think it worth a punishment 

to that 
in my own name I answer I condemn 
and urge the bloody guilt against my nephew 
it be violent and cruel a black deed 
a deed who memory do make i shudder 
a act that do betray a tyrannous nature 
which he take up in war the school of vengeance 
and though the king compassion spare he here 
unless his heart weep itself out in penitent tear 

this sound 
as you be now a good man 

do your grace 
think I have conscience to allow the murder 
although when it be do I do obey 
the stream of nature as he be my kinsman 
to plead he may not pay his forfeit life 
can I do less for one so near my blood 
Consider madam and be charitable 
let not this wild injustice make i lose 
the character I bear and reverend habit 
to make you full acquaint with my innocence 
I challenge here my soul and heaven to witness 
if I have any thought or knowledge with 
my nephew plot or person when he come 
under the smooth pretence of friend to violate 
your hospitable law and do that act 
who frequent mention draw this tear a whirlwind 
snatch i to endless flame 

I must believe 
and ask your grace pardon I confess 
I have not love you since Alvarez death 
though we be reconcile 

I do not blame 
your jealousy nor any zeal you have 
to prosecute revenge against i madam 
as I then stand suspect nor can yet 
implore your mercy to Columbo all 
I have to say be to retain my first 
opinion and credit with your grace 
which you may think I urge not out of fear 
or end upon you since I thank the king 
I stand firm on the base of royal favour 
but for your own sake and to show I have 
compassion of your suffering 

you have clear 
a doubt my lord and by this fair remonstrance 
give my sorrow so much truce to think 
that we may meet again and yet be friend 
but be not angry if I still remember 
by who Alvarez die and weep and wake 
another justice with my prayer 

all thought 
that may advance a better peace dwell with you 

how will this cozen statesman bribe my faith 
with flattery to think he innocent 
no if his nephew die this cardinal must not 
be longlived all the prayer of a wrong widow 
make firm Hernando sword and my own hand 
shall have some glory in the next revenge 
I will pretend my brain with grief distract 
it may gain easy credit and beside 
the take off examination 
for great Columbo death it make what act 
I do in that believe want of my reason 
appear no crime but my defence look down 
soul of my lord from thy eternal shade 
and unto all thy bless companion boast

repent the affront my passion throw upon thou

if thou do execute as dare 
as thou provoke a quarrel I do think 
thy soul a starveling or asleep 

you will find it 
active enough to keep your spirit wake 
which to exasperate for yet I think 
it be not high enough to meet my rage 
do you smile 

this noise be worth it gentleman 
I be sorry this great soldier have engage 
your travel all his business be to talk 

a little of your lordship patience

I come to meet it if your courage be so fortunate 
but there be more than my own injury 
you must account for sir if my sword prosper 
who point and every edge be make more keen 
with young Alvarez blood in which I have 
a noble interest do not that sin benumb 
thy artery and turn the guilty flow

strike into air as thou be shoot by some 
engine from heaven

shall lose much honour in his fall 

that duchess 
who but to mention with thy breath be sacrilege 
a orphan of thy make and condemn 
by thou to eternal solitude I come 
to vindicate and while I be kill thou 
by virtue of her prayer send up for justice 
at the same time in heaven I be pardon for it 

I can hear the bravo 

two word more 
and take your chance before you all I must 
pronounce that noble lady without knowledge 
or thought of what I undertake for she 
poor soul she be now at her devotion 
busy with heaven and wear out the earth 
with her stiff knee and bribe her good angel 
with treasure of her eye to tell her lord 
how much she long to see he my attempt 
need no commission from she be I 
a stranger in Navarre the inborn right 
of every gentleman to Alvarez loss 
be reason to engage their sword and life 
against the common enemy of virtue 

now have you finish I have a instrument 
shall cure this noise and fly up to thy tongue 
to murder all thy word 

one little knot 
of phlegm that clog my stomach and I ba do 
you have a uncle call a cardinal 
will he be lurk now about thy heart 
that the same wound may reach you both and send 
your reel soul together now have at you 

we must not sir be idle 

what think you now of pray 

time enough 
commend i to my friend the scale be even 
I will be merciful and give you time 
now to consider of the other world 
you will find your soul benight present 

I will find my way in the dark 

a stumble be dangerous 
now ask thy life ha 

I despise to wear it 
a gift from any but the first bestower 

I scorn a base advantage ha 

I be now 
out of your debt 

thou have do it and I forgive thou 
give i thy hand when shall we meet again 

never I hope 

I feel life ebb apace yet I will look upward 
and show my face to heaven 

the matter do 
I must not stay to bury he 

Columbo death do much afflict the king 

I think the cardinal will have lose his wit 
at first for his nephew it drown all the talk 
of the other that be slay 

we be friend 
I do suspect Hernando have some interest 
and know how their wound come 

his flight confirm it 
for who the cardinal have spread his net 

he be not so weak to trust himself at home 
to his enemy gripe 

all strike not i so much 
as that the duchess most oppress lady 
shall be distract and before Columbo 
be slay 

but that the cardinal shall be make 
her guardian be to i above that wonder 

so it please the king and she with that small stock 
of reason leave she be so kind and smooth 
upon he 

she be turn a child again a madness 
that will have make her brain and blood boil high 
in which distemper she may have wrought something 

have be to purpose 

the cardinal be cunning and however 
his brow do smile he do suspect Hernando 
take fire from she and wait a time to punish it 

but what a subject of disgrace and mirth 
have poor Celinda make herself by pride 
in her belief Columbo be her servant 
her head have stoop much since he die and she 
almost ridiculous at court 

the cardinal 
be come into the garden now 

walk off 
it trouble i the duchess by her loss 
of brain be now beneath my great revenge 
she be not capable to feel my anger 
which like to unregarded thunder spend 
in wood and lightning aim at senseless tree 
must idle fall and hurt she not not to 
that sense her guilt deserve a fatal stroke 
without the knowledge for what crime to fright she 
when she take leave and make she tug with death 
until her soul sweat be a pigeon torment 
and she be send a babe to the other world 
Columbo death will not be satisfy 
and I but wound she with a two edge feather 
I must do more I have all opportunity 
she by the king now make my charge but she be 
so much a turtle I shall lose by kill she 
perhaps do she a pleasure and preferment 
that must not be 

be not this she that will be think to have be 
Columbo mistress madam his grace be private 
and will not be disturb you may displease he 

what will your worship wager that he shall 
be please again before we part 

I will say this diamond madam against a kiss 
and trust yourself to keep the stake 

it be do 

I have long have a appetite to this lady 
but the lord keep she up so high this toy 
may bring she on 

this interruption taste not of good manner 

but where necessity my lord compel 
the boldness may meet pardon and when you 
have find my purpose I may less appear 
unmannerly 

to the business 

it do please 
your nephew sir before his death to credit i 
with so much honourable favour I 
be come to tender to his near of blood 
yourself what do remain a debt to he 
not to delay your grace with circumstance 
that deed if you accept make you my heir 
of no contemptible estate this way 
be only leave to tie up scurrile tongue 
and saucy man that since Columbo death 
venture to libel on my pride and folly 
his greatness and this gift which I enjoy 
still for my life beyond which term a kingdom be 
nothing will curb the giddy spleen of man 
that live on impudent rhyme and rail at 
each wander fame they catch

will bind my gratitude and care to serve you

be please you may conjecture I may keep 
your gem the kiss be never you

and so farewell for this time

apace good excellent revenge and pleasant

a satisfaction for Columbo death 
only to kill she by soft charm or force 
I will rifle first her darling chastity 
it will be after time enough to poison she 
and she to the world be think she own destroyer 
as I will frame the circumstance this night 
all may be finish for the colonel 
her agent in my nephew death who I 
disturb at counsel with she I may reach he 
hereafter and be master of his fate 
we starve our conscience when we thrive in state

die all deceive trust 

this be a strange impiety 

when man 
of gift and sacred function once decline 
from virtue their ill deed transcend example 

the minute be come that I must take my leave too 
your hand great sir and though you be a king 
we may exchange forgiveness heaven forgive 
and all the world I come I come Alvarez 

dispose their body for become funeral 
how much be king abuse by those they take 
to royal grace who when they cherish most 
by nice indulgence they do often arm 
against themselves from whence this maxim spring 
none have more need of perspective than king 

I be come to you gentleman the poet 
have help i thus far on my way but I will 
be even with he the play be a tragedy 
the first that ever he compose for we 
wherein he think he have do pretty 
and I be sensible I prithee look 
be nothing out of joint have he break nothing 

nor sir I hope 

yes he have break his epilogue all to piece 
can thou put it together again 

not I sir 

nor I prithee be go humh mr poet 
I have a teem mind to be revenge 
you may assist and not be see in it now 
if you please gentleman for I do know 
he listen to the issue of his cause 
but blister not your hand in his applause 
your private smile your nod or hum to tell 
my fellow that you like the business well 
and when without a clap you go away 
I will drink a smallbeer health to his second day 
and break his heart or make he swear and rage 
he will write no more for the unhappy stage 
but that be too much so we shall lose faith show it 
and if you like his play it be as well he know it
