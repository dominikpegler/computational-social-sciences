with a verse or two steal from a paint cloth 
the which I here the wench keep in her chest 
well let she keep it I shall find a fellow 
that can both write and read and make rhyme too 
and if I do well I say no more 
I will send from London such a taunt letter 
as shall eat the heart he send with salt 
and sling the dagger at the painter head 

what need all this I say that Susan be thou

I happen on a painter yesternight 
the only cunning man of Christendom 
for he can temper poison with his oil 
that who so look upon the work he draw 
shall with the beam that issue from his sight 
suck venom to his breast and slay himself 
sweet Alice he shall draw thy counterfeit 
that Arden may by gaze on it perish 

ay but Mosby that be dangerous

I hear your husband have the grant of late 
confirm by letter patent from the king

and whatsoever lease be before

he have the grant under the chancery seal 

pardon i mistress Arden I must speak 
for I be touch your husband do i wrong 
to wring i from the little land I have 
my live be my life only that 
rest remainder of my portion 
desire of wealth be endless in his mind 
and he be greedy gape still for gain 
nor care he though young gentleman do beg 
so he may scrape and hoard up in his pouch 
but see he have take my land I will value life 
as careless as he be careful for to get 
and tell he this from i I will be revenge 
and so as he shall wish the abbey land 
have rest still within their former state 

alas poor gentleman I pity you 
and woe be i that any man shall want 
God know it be not my fault but wonder not 
though he be hard to other when to i 
ah master green God know how I be use 

why mistress Arden can the crabbed churl 
use you unkind respect he not your birth 
your honourable friend nor what you bring 
why all Kent know your parentage and what you be 

ah m green be it speak in secret here 
I never live good day with he alone 
when he be at home then have I froward look 
hard word and blow to mend the match withal 
and though I may content as good a man 
yet do he keep in every corner trull 
and weary with his trug at home 
then ride he straight to London there forsooth 
he revel it among such filthy one 
as counsel he to make a way his wife 
thus live I daily in continual fear 
in sorrow so despair of redress 
as every day I wish with hearty prayer 
that he or I be take forth the world 

now trust i mistress Alice it grieve i 
so fair a creature shall be so abuse 
why who will have think the civil sir so sullen 
he look so smooth now fie upon he churl 
and if he live a day he live too long 
but frolic woman I shall be the man 
shall set you free from all this discontent 
and if the churl deny my interest 
and will not yield my lease into my hand 
I will pay he home whatever hap to i 

but speak you as you think 

I God be my witness I mean plain deal 
for I have rather die than lose my land 

then master green be counsel by i 
endanger not yourself for such a churl 
but hire some cutter for to cut he short 
and here be ten pound to wager they with all 
when he be dead you shall have twenty more 
and the land whereof my husband be possess 
shall be entitle as they be before 

will you keep promise with i 

or count i false and perjure while I live 

then here be my hand I will have he so dispatch 
I will up to London straight I will thither post 
and never rest till I have compass it

and take advantage to eat he up 
ah harmless Arden how how have thou misdo 
that thus thy gentle life be level at 
the many good turn that thou have do to i

and shall I not deal current with they 
their lawless rage will take revenge on i 
tush I will spurn at mercy for this once 
let pity lodge where feeble woman lie 
I be resolve and Arden needs must die Exit Michael 

no Franklin no if fear or stormy threat 
if love of i or care of womanhood 
if fear of God or common speech of man 
who mangle credit with their wound word 
and cooch dishonour as dishonour bud 
may soyne repentance in her wanton thought 
no question then but she will turn the lease 
and sorrow for her dissolution 
but she be root in her wickedness 
perverse and stubborn not to be reclaim 
good counsel be to she as rain to weed 
and reprehension make her vice to grow 
as Hydra head that perish by decay 
her fault methinks be paint in my face 
for every search eye to over reed 
And Mosby name a scandal unto i 
be deep trench in my blush brow 
ah Franklin Franklin when I think on this 
my heart grief rend my other power 
worse than the conflict at the hour of death 

gentle Arden leave this sad lament 
she will amend and so your grief will cease 
or else she will die and so your sorrow end 
if neither of these two do happy fall 
yet let your comfort be that other bear 
your woe twice double all with patience 

my house be irksome there I can rest 

then stay with i in London go not home 

then that base Mosby do usurp my room 
and make his triumph of my be thence 
at home or not at home where ere I be 
here here it lie ah Franklin here it lie 
that will not out till wretched Arden die 

forget your grief a while here come your man

ah what a hell be fretful jealousy 
what pity moan word what deep fetch sigh 
what grievous groan and overlade woe 
accompany this gentle gentleman 
now will he shake his care oppress head 
than sir his sad eye on the sullen earth 
ashamed to gaze upon the open world 
now will he cast his eye up towards the heaven 
look that way for redress of wrong 
some time he seek to beguile his grief 
and tell a story with his careful tongue 
then come his wife dishonour in his thought 
and in the middle cut of his tale 
dower fresh sorrow on his weary limb 
so woe bego so inly charge with woe 
be never any live and bear it so 

my m will desire you come to bed 

be he himself already in his bed 

he be and fain will have the light away 
conflict thought encamp in my breast 
awake i with the echo of their stroke 
and I a judge to censure either side 
can give to neither wish victory 
my master kindness plead to i for life 
with just demand and I must grant it he 
my mistress she have force i with a oath 
for Susan sake the which I may not break 
for that be near than a master love 
that grim face fellow pitiless black will 
and Shakebag stern in bloody stratagem 
two rough ruffian never live in Kent 
have swear my death if I infringe my vow 
a dreadful thing to be consider of 
methinks I see they with their bolster hair 
stare and grin in thy gentle face 
and in their ruthless hand their dagger draw 
insult over there with a peck of oath 
while thou submissive plead for relief 
be mangle by their ireful instrument 
methinks I hear they ask where Michael be 
and pitiless black will cry stab the slave 
the peasant will detect the tragedy 
the wrinkle in his foul death threaten face 
gape open wide like grave to swallow man 
my death to he be but a merriment 
and he will murder i to make he sport 
he come he come ah m Franklin help 
call up the neighbour or we be but dead 

what dismal outcry call i from my rest 

what have occasion such a fearful cry 
speak Michael have any injure thou 

Nothing sir but as I fall asleep 
upon the threshold lean to the stair 
I have a fearful dream that trouble i 
and in my slumber think I be beset 
with murderer thief that come to rifle i 
my tremble joint witness my inward fear 
I crave your pardon for disturb you 

so great a cry for nothing I never hear

let i have no more such prank as these 
come m Franklin let we go to bed 

i be my faith the air be very cold exeunt 
Michael farewell I pray thou dream no more 

black night have hide the pleasure of that day here enter Will Gre and Shak 
and sheet darkness overhang the earth 
and with the black fold of her cloudy robe 
obscure we from the eyesight of the world 
in which sweet silence such as we triumph 
the lazy minute linger on their time 
loath to give due audit to the hour 
until in the watch our purpose be complete 
and Arden send to everlasting night 
Greene get you go and linger here about 
and at some hour hence come to we again 
where we will give you instance of his death 

speed to my wish who will soever say not 
and so I will leave you for a hour or two Exit Gre 

I tell thou Shakebag will this thing be do 
I be so heavy that I can scarce go 
this drowsiness in i bode little good 

now now will become a precisian 
nay then let we go sleep when huges and fear 
shall kill our courage with their fancy work 

why Shakebag thou mistake i much 
and wrong i to in tell i of fear 
be not a serious thing we go about 
it shall be slip till I have seek with thou 
to let thou know I be no coward I 
I tell thou Shakebag thou abuse i 

why thy speech bewray a inly kind of fear 
And favour of a weak relent spirit 
go forward now in that we have begin 
and afterward attempt i when thou dare 

and if I do not heaven cut i of 
but let that pass and show i to this house 
where thou shall see I will do as much as Shakebag 

this be the door but soft methinks it be shut 
the villain Michael have deceive we 

soft let i see Shakebag it be shut indeed 
Knock with thy sword perhaps the slave will hear 

it will not be the white livered peasant be go to bed 
and laugh we both to scorn 

and he shall by his merriment as dear 
as ever coistrel buy so little sport 
here let this sword assist i when I need 
but rust and canker after I have swear 
if I the next time that I meet the hind 
lop not away his leg his arm or both 

and let i never draw a sword again 
nor prosper in the twilight cockshut light 
when I will fleece the wealthy passenger 
but lie and languish in a loathsome den 
hate and spit at by the goer by 
and in that death may die unpitied 
if I the next time that I meet the slave 
cut not the nose from of the coward face 
and trample on it for this villainy 

come let we go seek out green I know he will swear 

he be a villain and he will not swear 
I will make a peasant swear among his boy 
that never dare say before but yea and no 
to be thus flout of a coistrel 

Shakebag let we seek out green and in the morning 
at the alehouse butt Arden house 
watch thou out come of that prick ear cur 
and then let I alone to handle he exeunt 

sirrah get you back to Billingsgate 
and learn what time the tide will serve our turn 
come to we in Paul first go make the bed 
and afterward go harken for the flood Exit Michael 
Come m Franklin you shall go with i 
this night I dream that be in a park 
a toil be pitch to overthrow the dear 
and I upon a little rise hill 
stand whist watch for the herd approach 
even there methinks a gentle slumber take i 
and summon all my part to sweet repose 
but in the pleasure of this golden rest 
a ill thew foster have remove the toil 
and round i with that beguile home 
which late methinks be pitch to cast the dear 
with that he blow a evil sound horn 
and at the noise another hear man come 
with falchion draw and bend it at my breast 
cry aloud thou be the game we seek 
with this I wake and tremble every joint 
like one obscure in a little bush 
that see a lion forage about 
and when the dreadful forest king be go 
he pry about with timorous suspect 
throughout the thorny casement of the brake 
and will not think his person dangerless 
but quake and shower though the cause be go 
so trust i Franklin when I do awake 
I stand in doubt whether I wake or no 
such great impression take this fond surprise 
God grant this vision bedeem i any good 

this fantasy do rise from Michael fear 
who be awake with the noise he make 
his trouble sense yet can take no rest 
and this I warrant you procure your dream 

it may be so God frame it to the best 
but often time my dream presage to true 

to such as note their nightly fantasy 
some one in twenty may incur belief 
but use it not it be but a mockery 

Come m Franklin we will now walk in Paul 
and dine together at the ordinary 
and by my man direction draw to the key 
and with the tide go down to Feversham 
say m Franklin shall it not be so 

at your good pleasure sir 
I will bear you company exeunt 

draw Shakebag for here be that villain Michael 

first will let we hear what he can say 

speak milksop slave and never after speak 

for god sake sir let i excuse myself 
for here I swear by heaven and earth and all 
I do perform the outmost of my talk 
and leave the door unbolt and unlock 
but see the chance Franklin and my master 
be very late confer in the porch 
and Franklin leave his napkin where he sit 
with certain gourlo knit mit as he say 
be in bed he do bethink himself 
and come down he find the door unshut 
he lock the gate and bring away the key 
for which offence my master rate i 
but now I be go to see what flood it be 
for with the tide my m will away 
where you may frons he well on Kaynum down 
a place well fit such a stratagem 

your excuse have some what molest my choler 
why now green it be better now nor ere it be 

but Michael be this true 

as true as I report it to be true 

then Michael this shall be your penance 
to feast we all at the salutation 
where we will plat our purpose thorough 

and Michael you shall bear no news of this tide 
because they two may be in kaynus down before your m 

why I will agree to any thing you will have i 
so you will except of my company exeunt 

disturb thought drive i from company 
and dry my marrow with their watchfulness 
continual trouble of my moody brain 
feeble my body by excess of drink 
and nip i as the bitter Northeast wind 
do check the tender blossom in the spring 
Well fare the man however his cate do taste 
that table not with foul suspicion 
and he but pine among his delicate 
who trouble mind be stuff with discontent 
my golden time be when I have no gold 
think then I want yet I sleep secure 
my daily toil beget i night repose 
my night repose make daylight fresh to i 
but since I climb the top bough of the tree 
and seek to build my nest among the cloud 
each gentle starry gale do shake my bed 
and make i dread my downfall to the earth 
but whether do contemplation carry i 
the way I seek to find where pleasure dwell 
be hedge behind i that I can back 
but needs must on although to danger gate 
then Arden perish thou by that decree 
for green do err the land and weed thou up 
to make my harvest nothing but pure corn 
and for his pain I will heave he up a while 
after smother after smother he to have his wax 
such bee as green must never live to sting 
then be there Michael and the painter to 
chief actor to Arden overthrow 
who when they shall see i sit in Arden seat 
they will insult upon i for my meed 
or fright i by detect of his end 
he none of that for I can cast a bone 
to make these cur pluck out each other throat 
and then be I sole ruler of my own 
yet mistress Arden live but she be myself 
and holy churchrite make we two but one 
but what for that I may not trust you Alice 
you have supplant Arden for my sake 
and will extirp i to plant another 
it be fearful sleep in a serpent bed 
and I will clean rid my hand of she here enter ae 
but here she come and I must flatter she 
how now Alice what sad and passionate 
make i partaker of thy pensiveness 
fire divide burn with lesser force 

but I will damn that fire in my breast 
till by the force thereof my part consume ah Mosby 

such deep pathaire like to a cannon burst 
discharge against a ruinate wall 
break my relent heart in thousand piece 
ungentle Alice thy sorrow be my sore 
thou know it well and it be thy policy 
to forge distressful look to wound a breast 
where lie a heart that die where thou be sad 
it be not love that love to anger love 

it be not love that love to murder love 

How mean you that 

thou know how dear Arden love i 

and then 

and then conceal the rest for it be too bad 
lest that my word be carry with the wind 
And publish in the world to both our shame 
I pray thou Mosby let our springtime wither 
our harvest else will yield but loathsome weed 
forget I pray thou what have pass betwixt we 
for now I blush and tremble at the thought 

what be you change 

I to my former happy life again 
from title of a odious strumpet name 
to honest Arden wife not Arden honest wife 
ha Mosby it be thou have rifle i of that 
and make i slanderous to all my kin 
even in my forehead be thy name engrave 
a mean artificer that low bear name 
I be bewitch woe worth the hapless hour 
and all the cause that enchant i 

nay if thou ban let i breathe curse forth 
and if you stand so nice at your fame 
let i repent the credit I have lose 
I have neglect matter of import 
that will have state i above thy state 
forslow advantage and spurn at time 
I fortune right hand Mosby have forsooth 
to take a wanton giglot by the jest 
I leave the marriage of an honest maid 
who dowry will have weigh down all thy wealth 
who beauty and demeanour far exceed thou 
this certain good I lose for change bad 
and wrap my credit in thy company 
I be bewitch that be no theme of thou 
and thou unhallowed have enchant i 
but I will break thy spell and exorcism 
and put another sight upon these eye 
that show my heart a raven for a dove 
thou be not fair I view thou not till now 
thou be not kind till now I know thou not 
and now the rain have beat of thy gilt 
thy worthless copper show thou counterfeit 
it grieve i not to see how foul thou be 
but mad i that ever I think thou fair 
go get thou go a copesmate for thy hind 
I be too good to be thy favourite 

I now I see and too soon find it true 
which often have be tell i by my friend 
that Mosby love i not but for my wealth 
which too incredulus I never believe 
nay hear i speak Mosby a word or two 
I will bite my tongue if it speak bitter 
look on i Mosby or I will kill myself 
nothing shall hide i from thy stormy look 
if thou cry war there be no peace for i 
I will do penance for offend thou 
and burn this prayer book where I here use 
the holy word that have convert i 
see Mosby I will tear away the leaf 
and all the leaf and in this golden cover 
shall thy sweet phrase and thy letter dwell 
and thereon will I chief meditate 
and hold no other sect but such devotion 
will thou not look be all thy love overwhelm 
will thou not hear what malice stop thy ear 
why speak thou not what silence tie thy tongue 
thou have be sight as the eagle be 
and hear as quick as the fearful hare 
and speak as smooth as a orator 
when I have bid thou hear or see or speak 
and be thou sensible in none of these 
weigh all thy good turn with this little fault 
and I deserve not Mosby muddy look 
a fence of trouble be not thicken still 
be clear again I will never more trouble thou 

o no I be a base artificer 
my wing be feather for a lowly sight 
Mosby fie no not for a thousand pound 
make love to you why it be unpardonable 
we beggar must not breathe where gentile be 

sweet Mosby be as gentle as a king 
and I too blind to judge he otherwise 
flower do some time spring in fallow land 
weed in garden rose grow on thorn 
so whatsoever my Mosby father be 
himself value gentle by his worth 

ah how you woman can insinuate 
and clear a trespass with your sweet set tongue 
I will forget this quarrel gentle Alice 
provide I will be tempt so no more 

then with thy lip seal up this new make match 

soft Alice for here come somebody

m Michael the spleen prickle you 
go to you carry a eye over mistress Susan 

i'faith to keep she from the painter 

why more from a painter then from a serve creature like yourself 

because you painter make but a paint fable of a pretty wench and spottle her beauty with blot 

what mean you by that

nay he must leave to live to live that we may love 
may live may love for what be life but love 
and love shall last as long as life remain 
and life shall end before my love depart 

why what be love without true constancy 
like to a pillar build of many stone 
yet neither with good mortar well compact 
nor semell to fasten it in the joint 
but that it shake with every blast of wind 
and be touch straight fall unto the earth 
and bury all his haughty pride in dust 
no let our love be rock of adamant 
which time nor place nor tempest can asunder

like love friend we will meet he on the way 
and bold beard and brave he to his tooth 
when word grow hot and blow begin to rise 
I will call those cutter forth your tenement

to part from any thing may do thou good 

he be come from Shorlow as I understand

he never will vouchsafe to speak with i 
if prayer and fair entreaty will not serve 
or make no battery in his flinty breast here enter Fra Ard and Michael 
I will curse the carl and see what that will do 
see where he come to further my intent 
m Arden I be now bind to the sea 
my come to you be about the plat of ground 
which wrongful you detain from i 
although the rent of it be very small 
yet will it help my wife and child 
which here I leave in Feversham God know 
needy and bare for Christ sake let they have it 

Franklin hear thou this fellow speak 
that which he crave I dear buy of he 
although the rent of it be ever i 
sirrah you that ask these question 
if with thy clamorous impeach tongue 
thou rail on i as I have hear thou do 
he lie thou up so close a twelvemonth day 
as thou shall neither see the son nor moon 
look to it for as sure as I live 
I will banish pity if thou use i thus 

what wist thou do i wrong and threat i too

God I beseech thou show some miracle 
on thou or thou in plague thou for this 
that plot of ground which thou detain from i 
I speak it in a agony of spirit 
be ruinous and fatal unto thou 
either there be butcher by thy dear friend 
or else be bring for man to wonder at 
or thou or thy miscarry in that place 
or there run mad and end thy curse day 

fie bitter knave bridle thy envious tongue 
for curse be like arrow shoot upright 
which fall down light on the suitor head 

light where they will be I upon the sea 
as oft I have in many a bitter storm 
and say a dreadful southern flaw at hand 
the pilot quake at the doubtful storm 
and all the sailor pray on their knee 
even in that fearful time will I fall down 
and ask of God whatever betide of i 
vengeance on Arden or some misevent 
to show the world what wrong the carl have do 
this charge I will leave with my distressful wife 
my child shall be teach such prayer as these 
and thus I go but leave my curse with thou

and great change from the old humour 
of her wont forwardness 
And seek by fair mean to redeem old fault 

happy the change that alter for the best 
but see in any case you make no speech 
of the cheer we have at my lord Cheiney 
although most bounteous and liberal 
for that will make she think herself more wrong 
in that we do carry she along 
for sure she grieve that she be leave behind 

Come Franklin let we strain to mend our pace 
and take she unaware play the cook here enter Alice and Mosby 
for I believe she will strive to mend our cheer

ah jealous harebrain man what have thou do 
when we to welcome thy intend sport 
come love to meet thou on thy way 
thou draw thy sword enrage with jealousy 
and hurt thy friend 
who thought be free from harm 
all for a worthless kiss and join arm

and i unhappy that devise the jest 
which though begin in sport yet end in blood 

marry God defend i from such a jest 

can thou not see we friendly smile on thou 
when we join arm and when I kiss his cheek 
have thou not late find i over kind 
do thou not hear i cry they murder thou

thus be I still and shall be while I die 
poor wench abuse by thy misgovernment 

but be it for truth that neither thou nor he 
intend malice in your misdemeanour 

the heaven can witness of our harmless thought 

then pardon i sweet Alice 
and forgive this fault 
forget but this and never see the like 
impose i penance and I will perform it

a death torment more than death itself

why m Arden know you what you do 
will you follow he that have dishonour you

he know no wrong can spite a jealous man 
more than the hateful name of the horn 

suppose it be true yet be it dangerous 
to follow he who he have late hurt 

a fault confess be more than half amends 
but man of such ill spirit as yourself 
work cross and debate betwixt man and wife 

I pray the gentle Franklin hold thy peace 
I know my wife counsel i for the best 

I will seek out Mosby where his wound be dress 
and salve his hapless quarrel if I may 

he who the devil drive must go perforce

and yet because his wife be the instrument 
his friend must not be laush in their speech exit Fran

And carry to the field for from that place 
backwards and forward may you see 
the print of many foot within the snow 
and look about this chamber where we be 
and you shall find part of his guiltless blood 
for in his slipshoe do I find some rush 
which argue he be murder in this room 

look in the place where he be wont to sit 
see see his blood it be too manifest 

it be a cup of wine that Michael shed 

I true 

it be his blood which strumpet thou have shed 
but if I live thou and thy complice 
which have conspire and wrought his death 
shall rue it 

ah m Franklin God and heaven can tell 
I love he more than all the world beside 
but bring i to he let i see his body 

bring that villain and Mosby sister too 
and one of you go to the flower deluce 
and seek for Mosby and apprehend he to exeunt 

the widow chambly in her husband day I keep 
and now he be dead she be grow so stout 
she will not know her old companion 
I come thither think to have have 
harbour as I be wont 
and she be ready to thrust i out at door 
but whether she will or no I get i up 
and as she follow i I spurn she down the stair 
and break her neck and cut her tapster throat 
and now I be go to sting they in the temes 
I have the gold what care I though it be know 
I will cross the water and take sanctuary 

see m Arden where your husband lie 
confess this foul fault and be penitent 

Arden sweet husband what shall I say 
the more I find his name the more he bleed 
this blood condemn i and in gush forth 
speak as it fall and ask i why I do it 
forgive i Arden I repent i now 
and will my death save thou thou shall not die 
rise up sweet Arden and enjoy thy love 
and frown not on i when we meet in heaven 
in heaven I love thou though on earth I do not 

say Mosby what make thou murder he 

study not for a answer look not down 
his purse and girdle find at thy bed head 
witness sufficient thou do the deed 
it bootless be to swear thou do it not 

I hire black will and Shakebag ruffian both 
and they and I have do this murderous deed 
but wherefore stay we 
Come and bear i hence 

those ruffian shall not escape 
I will up to London and get the counsel warrant to apprehend they exeunt 

Shakebag I hear have take sanctuary 
but I be so pursue with hue and cry 
for petty robbery that I have do 
that I can come unto no sanctuary 
therefore must I in some oyster boat 
at last be fain to go a board some hoy 
and so to flush there be no stay here 
at Sittinburgh the watch be like to take i 
and have I not with my buckler cover my head 
and run full blank at all adventure 
I be sure I have never go further than that place 
for the constable have 20 warrant to apprehend i 
beside that I rob he and his man once at Gades hill 
farewell England I will to Flushing now Exit Will 

Come make haste and bring away the prisoner 

m Arden you be now go to God 
and I be by the law condemn to die 
about a letter I bring from m Greene 
I pray you m Arden speak the truth 
be I ever privy to your intent or no 

what shall I say 
you bring i such a letter 
but I dare swear thou know not the content 
leave now to trouble i with worldly thing 
and let i meditate upon my saviour Christ 
who blood must save i for the blood I shed 

how long shall I live in this hell of grief 
convey i from the presence of that strumpet 

ah but for thou I have never be strumpet 
what can not oath and prote station do 
when man have opportunity to woe 
I be too young to sound thy villainy 
but now I find it and repent too late 

ah gentle brother wherefore shall I die 
I know not of it till the deed be do 

for thou I mourn more than for myself 
but let it suffice I can not save thou now 

and if your brother and my mistress 
have not promise i you in marriage 
I have never give consent to this foul deed 

leave to accuse each other now 
and listen to the sentence I shall give 
bear Mosby and his sister to London straight 
where they in Smithfield must be execute 
bear m Arden unto Canterbury 
where her sentence be she must be burn 
Michael and Bradshaw in Feversham 
must suffer death 

let my death make amends for all my sin 

fie upon woman this shall be my song 
but bear i hence for I have live too long 

sing no hope on earth in heaven be my hope 

faith I care not see I die with Susan 

my blood be on his head that give the sentence 

to speedy execution with they all exeunt 

thus have you see the truth of Arden death 
as for the ruffian Shakebag and black will 
the one take sanctuary and be send for out 
be murder in Southwark as he pass 
to Greenwich where the lord protector lie 
black will be burn in flush on a stage 
Greene be hang at Osbridge in rent 
the painter flee and how he die we know not 
but this above the rest be to be note 
Arden lie murder in that plot of ground 
which he by force and violence hold from reed 
and in the grass his body print be see 
two year and more after the deed be do 
gentleman we hope you will pardon this naked tragedy 
wherein no file point be foist in 
to make it gracious to the ear or eye 
for simple trust be gracious enough 
and needs no other point of gloss stuff
