we be drink so early we mistake whole saddle 
sometime a horse and than it seem to we too 
every poor jade have his whole peck and tumble 
up to his ear in clean straw and every bottle 
show at the least a dozen when the truth be sir 
there be no such matter not a smell of provender 
not so much straw as will tie up a horse tail 
nor any thing in the rack but two old cobweb 
and so much rot hay as have be a hen nest 

well these mistake must be mend Lazaro 
these apparition that abuse our sense 
and make we ever apt to sweep the manger 
but put in nothing these fancy must be forget 
and we must pray it may be reveal to we 
who horse we ought in conscience to cozen 
and how and when a parson horse may suffer 
a little grease in his tooth it be wholesome 
and keep he in a sober shuffle and his saddle 
may want a stirrup and it may be swear 
his learning lie on one side and so break it 
have ever oat in his cloakbag to prevent we 
and therefore it be a meritorious office 
to tithe he sound 

and a grazier may 
for those be pinch puckfoyst and suspicious 
suffer a mist before his eye sometime too 
and think he see his horse eat half a bushel 
when the truth be rub his gum with salt 
till all the skin come off he shall but mumble 
like a old woman that be chew brawn 
and drop they out again 

that may do well too 
and no doubt it be but venial but good Lazaro

signior Marcantonio 
till meat be ready let we sit here and prepare 
our stomach with discourse 

what you please sir 

pray you answer i to this doubt 

if I can sir 

why shall such plant as you be pleasure child 
that owe their blush year to gentle object 
tender breed and bring up in all fullness 
desire the stubborn war 

in those it be wonder 
that make their ease their god and nor their honour 
but noble general my end be other 
desire of knowledge sir and hope of tie 
discretion to my time which only show i 
and not my year a man and make that more 
which we call handsome the rest be but boy beauty 
and with the boy consume 

you argue well sir 

nor do I wear my youth as they be breeche 
for object but for use my strength for danger 
which be the liberal part of man not dalliance 
the war must be my mistress sir 

o signior 
you will find she a rough wench 

when she be win once 
she will show the sweet sir 

you can be please though 
sometime to take a tame 

it be a truth sir 
so she be handsome and not ill condition 

a soldier shall not be so curious 

I can make shift with any for a heat sir 

nay there you wrong your youth too and however 
you be please to appear to i which show well signior 
a tough soul than your few year can testify 
yet my young sir out of my own experience 
when my spring be I be able to confute you 
and say you have rather come to the shock of eye 
and bold march up to your mistress mouth 
then to the cannon 

that be as their lade be sir 

there be trench 
fit and warm for your year and safe 
than where the bullet play 

there be it I doubt sir 

you will easy find that faith but come be liberal 
what kind of woman can you make best war with 

they be all but heavy march 

fie Marcantonio 
beauty in no more reverence 

in the sex sir 
I honour it and next to honour love it 
for there be only beauty and that sweetness 
that be first mean for modesty sever it 
and put it in one woman it appear not 
it be of too rare a nature she too gross 
to mingle with it 

this be a mere heresy 

which make they ever mend for that gloss 
that cozen we for beauty be but bravery 
a outward show of thing well set no more 
for heavenly beauty be as heaven itself sir 
too excellent for object and what be see 
be but the veil then airy cloud grant this 
it may be see it be but like star in twinkle 

it be no small study in their library 
bring you to this experience but what think you 
of that fair red and white which we call beauty 

why it be our creature sir we give it they 
because we like those colour else it be certain 
a blue face with a motley nose will do it 
and be as great a beauty so we love it 
that we can give which be only beauty 
be a fair mind 

by this rule all our choice 
be to no end 

except the dull end do 

then all to you seem equal 

very true sir 
and that make equal deal I love any 
that be worth love 

how long love you signior 

till I have other business 

do you never 
love steadfast one woman 

it be a toil sir 
like ride in one ride perpetual 
it offer no variety 

right youth 
he must needs make a soldier nor do you think 
one woman can love one man 

yes that may be 
though it appear not often they be thing ignorant 
and therefore apt to that superstition 
of dote fondness yet of late year signior 
that world be well mend with they few be find now 
that love at length and to the right mark all 
stir now as the time stir fame and fashion 
be end they aim at now and to make that love 
that wise age hold ambition 
they that can reach this may love by index 
by every day survey who best promise 
who have do best who may do and who mend 
may come to do again who appear neat 
either in new stamp clothes or courtesy 
do but from hand to mouth neither nor love they these thing 
long than new be make nor that succession 
beyond the next fair feather take the city 
there they go to it by gold weight no gain from they 
all they can work by fire and water to they 
profit be all they point at if there be love 
it be show you by so dark a light to bear out 
the brack and old stain in it that you may purchase 
french velvet better cheap all love be endless 

faith if you have a mistress will she hear you 

it be but the venture of my place or swear 
I mean it but for argument as schoolman 
dispute high question 

what a world be this 
when young man dare determine what those be 
age and the best experience never can aim at 

they be thick eye then sir now the print be big 
and they may read their fortune without spectacle 

do you never love 

faith yes once after supper 
and the fit hold till midnight 

hot or shake 

to say true both 

how do you rid it 

thus sir 
I lay my hand upon my heart and bless i 
and then say over certain charm I have learn 
against mad dog for love and they be all one 
last think upon a windmill and so sleep 
and be well ever after

of speech may trouble i till I have say 
what I will quick do 

what will she say 

Come gentleman I pray you lend your ear 
and keep your voice 

signior Marcantonio 
how do you 

o the surgeon 

let i tell you 
who know as well as you you do dissemble 
it be no time to do so leave the thought 
of this vain world forget your flesh and blood 
and make your spirit a untroubled way 
to pass to what it ought 

you be not in earnest 
why I can walk sir and be well 

it be true 
that you can walk and do believe you be well 
it be the nature as your surgeon say 
of these wound for a man to go and talk 
nay merry till his last hour his minute 
for heaven sake sir sit down again 

alas 
where be the surgeon 

sir they will not come 
if they shall dress you you will die they say 
ere one tell twenty trouble not your mind 
keep your head warm and do not stir you body 
and you may live a hour 

o heaven a hour 
Alas it be too little to remember 
but half the wrong that I have do how short 
then for contrition and how least of all 
for satisfaction 

but you desire 
to satisfy 

heaven know I do 

then know 
that I be he or she or what you will 
most wrong by you your Leocadia 
I know you must remember i 

o heaven 

that lose her friend that lose her father house 
that lose her fame in lose of her sex 
with these strange garment there be no excuse 
to hinder i it be within your power 
to give i satisfaction you have time 
leave in this little piece of life to do it 
therefore I charge you for your conscience sake 
and for our fame which I will fain have live 
when both of we be dead to celebrate 
that contract which you have both seal and swear 
yet ere you die which must be hasty 
heaven know 

Alas the sting of conscience 
to deathward for our fault draw near all 
and hear what I unhappy man shall say 
first madam I desire your pardon next 
I fall my spirit fail i gentleman 
let i shake hand with you and let we be friend 
for I have do wrong upon wrong so thick 
I know not where that every man methinks 
shall be my enemy forgive i both 
last it be true o I do feel the power 
of death seize on i that I be contract 
by seal and oath to Leocadia 
I must speak fast because I fear my life 
will else be short than my speech will be 
but it be impossible to satisfy 
you Leocadia but by repentance 
though I can die and bold say 
I know not your dishonour yet that be 
your virtue and not i you know it well 
but herein lie the impossibility 
oh Theodosia Theodosia 
I be betroth to Theodosia 
before I ever see thou heaven forgive i 
she be my wife this half hour while I live 

that be I that be I I be Theodosia 
hear i a little now who have not suffer 
disgrace at all methinks since you confess 
what I so long have seek for here be with i 
Philippo too my brother 

I be glad 
all happiness to he come let i kiss thou 
beg pardon of that maid for my offence 
and let i further with a die breath 
tell in thy ear the rest of my desire 

I be afraid they will all four turn woman 
if we hold long talk 

Alas there be 
no hope for i that be Theodosia 
and that her brother I be only sorry 
I be behold to they I will search 
over the world as careless of my fortune 
as they of i till I can meet a curse 
to make these almostkilling sorrow worse Exit

a just confession from you which she have 
a happy one for i ask of this lady

within for your own fancy

within belike 

I feel myself methinks as well as ever 

Keep then your mind so too I do forgive 
the fault you do to i but here be one

neither shall she 
when I make jest of oath again or make 
my lust play with religion when I leave

Appeal to reason 
she will reprieve you from the power of grief 
which rule but in her absence hear i say 
a sovereign message from she which in duty 
and love to your own safety you ought hear 
why do you strive so whither will you fly 
you can wrest yourself away from care 
you may from council you may shift your place 
but not your person and another climb 
make you no other 

oh 

for passion sake 
which I do serve honour and love in you 
if you will sigh sigh here if you will vary 
a sigh to tear or outcry do it here 
no shade no desert darkness nor the grave 
shall be more equal to your thought then I 
only but hear i speak 

what will you say 

that which shall raise your heart or pull down i 
quiet your passion or provoke my own 
we must have both one balsam or one wound 
for know love fair since the first providence 
make i your rescue I have read you through 
and with a wonder pity look on you 
I have observe the method of your blood 
and wait on it even with sympathy 
of a like red and paleness in my own 
I know which blush be anger which be love 
which be the eye of sorrow which of truth 
and can distinguish honour from disdain 
in every change and you be worth my study 
I see your voluntary misery 
sustain in travel a disguise maid 
weary with seek and with find lose 
neglect where you hope most or put by 
I see it and have lay it to my heart 
and though it be my sister which be right 
yet be by your wrong I put off nature 
can not be glad where I be bind to triumph 
my care for you so drown respect of she 
nor do I only apprehend your bond 
but study your release and for that day 
have I make up a ransom bring you health 
preservative against chance or injury 
please you apply it to the grief myself 

humh 

nay do not think i less than such a cure 
Antonio be not and it be possible 
Philippo may succeed my blood and house 
be as deep root and as fair spread 
as MarkAntonio and in that all seek 
fortune have give he no precedency 
as for our thank to nature I may burn 
incense as much as he I ever dare 
walk with Antonio oy the selfsame light 
at any feast or triumph and never care 
which side my lady or her woman take 
in their survey I dare have tell my tale too 
though his discourse new end 

my repulse 

let not that torture you which make i happy 
nor think that conscience fair which be no shame 
it be no repulse I be your dowry rather 
for then methinks a thousand grace meet 
to make you lovely and ten thousand story 
of constant virtue which you then outreach 
in one example do proclaim you rich 
nor do I think you wretched or disgrace 
after this suffer and do therefore take 
advantage of your need but rather know 
you be the charge and business of those power 
who like best tutor do inflict hard task 
upon great nature and of noble hope 
read trivial lesson and half line to slug 
they that live long and never feel mischance 
spend more than half their age in ignorance 

it be well you think so 

you shall think so too 
you shall sweet Leocadia and do so 

good sir no more you have too fair a shape 
to play so foul a part in as the tempter 
say that I can make peace with fortune who 
who shall absolve i of my vow yet ha 
my contract make 

your contract 

yes my contract 
be I not he his wife 

sweet nothing less 

I have no name then 

Truly then you have not 
how can you be his wife who be before 
another husband 

o though he dispense 
with his faith give I can with i 

you do mistake clear soul his precontract 
do annul you and you have give no faith 
that tie you in religion or humanity 
you rather sin against that great precept 
to covet what be another sweet you do 
believe i who dare not urge dishonest thing 
remove that scruple therefore and but take 
your danger now into your judgement scale 
and weigh they with your safety think but whither 
now you can go what you can do to live 
how near you have bar all port to your own succour 
except this one that I here open love 
shall you be leave alone you be a prey 
to the wild lust of any who will look 
upon this shape like a temptation 
and think you want the man you personate 
will not regard this shift which love put on 
as virtue force but covet it like vice 
so shall you live the slander of each sex 
and be the child of error and of shame 
and which be worse even markantony 
will be call just to turn a wanderer off 
and fame report you worthy his contempt 
where if you make new choice and settle here 
there be no further tumult in this flood 
each currant keep his course and all suspicion 
shall return honour come you forth a maid 
go home a wife alone and in disguise 
go home a wait Leocadia 
go home and by the virtue of that charm 
transform all mischief as you be transform 
turn your offend father wrath to wonder 
and all his loud grief to a silent welcome 
unfold the riddle you have make what say you
