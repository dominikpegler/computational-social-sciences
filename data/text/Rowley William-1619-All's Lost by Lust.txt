Give leave Lothario 

my sovereign 

the news in brief how reply jacinta 
will she be woman will she meet our arm 
with a alternate roundure will she do 

nothing to the purpose my liege cold as Aquarius 
there she be bear and there she still remain 
I can move she to enter into pisces I 
lay the flesh to she too and the delight thereof she lean 
another way and talk all of the spirit I 
fright she with spirit too but all will not do 
she draw her knife point it to her breast swear 
she will do something but woman tongue be 
sometime long than their arm 

enough we have bethink another way 
This woo application be too mild 
it be better trust the mercy of a storm 
to haste our way than to be calm for ever 
short of the wish haven 
now draw near you tell we of a hot invasion 
the barbarous and tawny african 
intend upon our confine 

true my liege 
full threescore thousand be descry in arm 
ready to pass the straits of Gibraltar 
who watery division their afric bound 
 they our Christian Europe in Granado 
and Andalusia they spread and flourish 
their silver moon lead as it be suppose 
by some blind guide some saintish infidel 
that prophesy subjection of our Spain 
unto the moor 

they will deter we with their swarthy look 
be they the same to their similitude 
sooty as the inhabitant of hell 
who they near figure cold fear shall fly 
from we as distant as they be from beauty 
they come to sacrifice their blood to we 
if that be red a mere rubrum 
we will make so high to quench their silver moon 
and on their carcase a isthmus make 
to pass their straits again and forage there 

your forward valour speak you majestical 
but my dread liege do not your treasury 
grow thin and empty so long have you hold 
a champion resolution against the Turk 
that Spain be waste in her noble strength 
on which presume it be to be sup

and yet we undaunted julianus our treasury be 
a my unscorched we have a castle 
suppose enchant we will break the magic 
if spell there be open the forbid door 
which twenty of our predecessor have refuse 
but add each a lock to guard it more 
rather than our soldier shall want pay 
to fight our battle noble 

o my lord that be a dangerous secret only know 
to such as can divine futurity 
and they with fearful prophecy predict 
fatal event to Spain when that shall be 
break up by violence till fate have run 
her own waste period which out stay 
auspicious they promise that wreathe be keep 
in the foredoom court of destiny 
to bind we ever in a happy conquest 

tut fear fright we not nor shall hope fool we 
if need provoke we will dig supply through hell 
and her enchantment who can prefix we 
a time to see these incantation lose 
perhaps it will stay ten generation more 
when our blood royal may want succession 
if not what boot it we lose in our dust 
and memory 500 year that then this hide 
work shall be tush the weakness of our predecessor 
shall not fright we all be not deadly 
that look dangerous 

I wish no life to see that day 

nor I so many king have fear that destiny

with the strong virgin in Spain and throw she down too

such a resemblance of a daughter duty 
will make you mindful of a father love 
for such my injury must exact from you

but to increase and multiply it more 
do to itself keep in its own perfume 
say that some rapine hand have pluck the bloom 
jacinta like that flower and ravish she 
defile her white lawn of chastity 
with ugly black of lust what will you do 

o it be too hard a question to resolve 
without a solemn council hold within 
of man best understand faculty 
there must be love and fatherhood and grief 
and rage and many passion and they must all 
beget a thing call vengeance but they must sit upon it 

say this be do by he that carry 
the fair seem face of friendship to yourself 

we shall fall out 

will you in such a case respect degree 

I know not that 

say he be noble 

impossible the act ignoble the bee can breed 
no poison though it suck the juice of hemlock 

Say a king shall do  be the  less do 
by the great power do majesty extenuate a crime 

augment it rather 

Say then that Rodericke your king and master 
to quit the honour you be bring home 
have ravish your jacinta 

who have send 
a fury in this foulfair shape to vex i 
I have see that face methinks yet know it not 
how dare thou speak this treason against my king 
dare any man in the world bring i this lie 
by this have be in hell Roderick a Tarquin 

yes and thy daughter have she do her part 
shall be the second Lucrece view i well 
I be jacinta

of your big heart if you have injury do you 
revenge they and we second you

and all will be at peace 

Best in my judgement 
we wake he with the fight of his win honour 
call up the army and let they present 
his prisoner to he such a sight as that 
will brook no sorrow near it 

it be a good doctor that prescribe that physic 
I will be your patient sir show i my soldier 
and my new honour win I will true weigh they 
with my full grief they may perhaps overcome

shall all be spend in blessing over thou 
farewell jacinta take my late blessing 
I know thy soul return a thank to i 
make haste to overtake i if thou be stay 
think of Cleopatra and Brutus wife 
there be many way to end a weary life 

Come sir I stand before you 

there I come 
thy death I will venture but receive my own 
so I have my doom and I have hit too 

ha ha ha 

laugh then 〈◊〉 any  ed then 

o bloody homicide thou have slay thy daughter 

false villain have thou then so mock my woe 
to make i fatal butcher of my child 
W●● she the target to defend thy body 
forgive i my jacinta it be in i 
a innocent act of blood but tyranny 
in that black monster it be not much ill 
better my hand then a worse arm shall spill 
thy guiltless life what be thou go yet 
thy warm blood cool my sun begin to set 
nature shrink backward to her former form 
our soul climb star while these descend to worm 
see tyrant from thy further stroke we fly 
heaven do thy will I will not curse die 

So now we live behold unto none 
upon this stair we do ascend our throne 
give we our title 

long live Mulli  king of Spain 

your silence it confirm take hence their body 
give they to Christian and let they bestow 
what ceremonious funeral they please 
we must pursue the fly r  
all must be we we will have no kingdom sharer 
let chronicler write here we begin our reign 
the first of Moor that ever be king of Spain
