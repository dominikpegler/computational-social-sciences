and get your breakfast trust i I have rather 
take a fair halter wash my hand and hang he 
myself make a clean riddance of he then 

what 

then dam he to that desperate course of life 

call you that desperate which by a line 
of institution from our ancestor 
have be derive down to we and receive 
in a succession for the noble way 
of breed up our youth in letter arm 
fair mien discourse civil exercise 
and all the blazon of a gentleman 
where can he learn to vault to ride to fence 
to move his body graceful to speak 
his language pure or to tune his mind 
or manner more to the harmony of nature 
then in these nursery of nobility 

I that be when the nursery self be noble 
and only virtue make it not the mercate 
that title be not vent at the drum 
or common outcry goodness give the greatness 
and greatness worship every house become 
a academy of honour and those part 
we see depart in the practice now 
quite from the institution 

why do you say so 
or think so envious do they not still 
learn there the centaur skill the art of Thrace 
to ride or Pollux mystery to fence 
the pyrrhic gesture both to dance and spring 
in armour to be active for the war 
to study figure number and proportion 
may yield they great in counsel and the art 
grave Nestor and the wise Ulysses practise 
to make their english sweet upon their tongue 
as reverend Chaucer say 

sir you mistake 
to play sir Pandarus my copy have it 
and carry message to madam Cressid 
instead of back the brave steed of morning 
to mount the chambermaid and for a leap 
of the vault horse to ply the vault house 
for exercise of arm a bale of dice 
or two or three pack of card to show the cheat 
and nimbleness of hand mistake a cloak 
from my lord back and pawn it ease his pocket 
of a superfluous watch or geld a jewel 
of a odd stone or so twinge three or four button 
from off my lady gown these be the art 
or seven liberal deadly science 
of pagery or rather paganism 
as the tide run to which if he apply he 
he may perhaps take a degree at Tyburn 
a year the early come to read a lecture 
upon Aquinas at S Thomas a water 
and so go forth a laureate in hemp circle 

you be tart my host and talk above your season 
over what you seem it shall not come methinks 
under your cap this vein of salt and sharpness 
these striking upon learning now and then 
how long have you if your dull guest may ask it 
drive this quick trade of keep the lightheart 
your mansion palace here or hostelry 

troth I be bear to somewhat sir above it 

I easy suspect that my host your name 

they call i Goodstock 

sir and you confess it 
both in your language treaty and your bear 

yet all sir be not son of the white hen 
nor can we as the songster say come all 
to be wrap soft and warm in fortune smock 
when she be please to trick or trump mankind 
some may be coat as in the card but than 
some must be knave some varlet bawd and ostler 
as ace deuce card o'ten to face it 
out in the game which all the world be 

but 
it be in your free will as it be to choose 
what part you will sustain methinks a man 
of your sagacity and clear nostril shall 
have make another choice then of a place 
so sordid as the keep of a inn 
where every jovial tinker for his chink 
may cry my host to cram give we drink 
and do not slink but skink or else you stink 
rogue bawd and cheater call you by the surname 
and know synonyma of your profession 

but if I be no such who then be the rogue 
in understand sir I mean who err 
who tinkle then or personate Thom Tinker 
your weasel here may tell you I talk bawdy 
and teach my boy it and you may believe he 
but sir at your own peril if I do not 
and at his too if he do lie and affirm it 
no slander strike less hurt the innocent 
if I be honest and that all the cheat 
be of myself in keep this light heart 
where I imagine all the world be a play 
the state and man affair all passage 
of life to spring new scene come in go out 
and shift and vanish and if I have get 
a seat to sit at ease here in my inn 
to see the comedy and laugh and chuck 
at the variety and throng of humour 
and disposition that come justle in 
and out still as they one drive hence another 
why will you envy i my happiness 
because you be sad and lumpish carry a Load stone 
in your pocket to hang knife on or lettering 
to entice light straw to leap at they be not take 
with the alacrity of a host it be more 
and just sir my wonder why you take 
my house up fiddler hall the seat of noise 
and mirth a inn here to be drowsy in 
and lodge your lethargy in the light heart 
as if some cloud from court have be your harbinger 
or Cheapside debtbook or some mistress charge 
see your love grow corpulent give it a diet 
by absence some such mouldy passion 

it be guess unhappy

ere you shall leave i I will break my heart

and weak will if it decline to obey she 

o master Lovel you must not give credit

and of this kiss I long to kiss a queen 

there be no life on earth but be in love 
there be no study no delight no business 
no intercourse or trade of sense or soul 
but what be love I be the lazy creature 
the most unprofitable sign of nothing 
the very drone and sleep away my life 
beyond the dormouse till I be in love 
And now I can outwake the nightingale 
outwatch a usurer and outwalk he too 
stalk like a ghost that haunt about a treasure 
and all that fancy treasure it be love

when you be silent and not say a word 

o but I love the more and she may read it 
best in my silence have she be 

as melancholic 
as you be pray you why will you stand mute sir 

o thereon hang a history my host

who serve so brave in France I be his page 
and ere he die his friend I follow he

I wait on his study which be right 
he have not Arthur nor no rosicler 
no knight of the sun nor Amadis de Gaul 
Primaleon and Pantagruel public nothing 
abortive of the fabulous dark cloister 
send out to poison court and infest manner 
but great Achilles Agamemnon act 
sage Nestor counsel and Ulysses slight 
Tydides fortitude as Homer wrought they 
in his immortal fantasy for example 
of the heroic virtue or as Virgil 
that master of the epic poem limn 
pious Aeneas his religious prince 
bear his age parent on his shoulder 
rapt from the flame of Troy with his young son 
and these he bring to practise and to use 
he give i first my breed I acknowledge 
then shower his bounty on i like the hour 
that openhanded sit upon the cloud 
and press the liberality of heaven 
down to the lap of thankful man but then 
the trust commit to i at his death 
be above all and leave so strong a tie 
on all my power as time shall not dissolve 
till it dissolve itself and bury all 
the care of his brave heir and only son 
who be a virtuous sweet young hopeful lord 
have cast his first affection on this lady 
and though I know and may presume she such 
as out of humour will return no love 
and therefore may indifferent be make 
the courtingstock for all to practise on 
as she do practise on all we to scorn 
yet out of a religion to my charge 
and debt profess I have make a selfdecree 
never to express my person though my passion 
burn i to cinder

or half so read in lovecraft as I take you 
Come come you be no phoenix and you be 
I shall expect no miracle from your ash 
take some advice be still that rag of love 
you be burn on till you turn tinder

for which your two hour service you shall take

year of despair age of misery 
nor can so short a happiness but spring 
a world of fear with thought of lose it 
better be never happy then to feel

put it on and do 

or in the bless attempt that I may die 

I marry there be happiness indeed 
transcendent to the melancholy mean 
it be a fate above a monument 
and all inscription to die so a death 
for emperor to enjoy and the king 
of the rich east to pawn their region for 
to sow their treasure open all their mine 
spend all their spice to embalm their corpse 
and wrap the inch up in sheet of gold 
that fall by such a noble destiny 
and for the wrong to your friend that fear be away 
he rather wrong himself follow fresh light 
new eye to swear by if lord Beaufort change

in the etc 
notice be etc 
to the ap etc 
that the etc 
and love etc 

every man or woman keep silence pain of imprisonment 

do your endeavour in the name of love 

to make my first approach then in love 

tell we what love be that we may be sure 
there be such a thing and that it be in nature 

excellent lady I do not expect 
to meet a infidel much less a atheist 
here in love be list of so much unbelief 
to raise a question of his be 

wellcharged 

I rather think and with religion think 
have all the character of love be lose 
his line dimension and whole signature 
raze and deface with dull humanity 
that both his nature and his essence may 
have find their mighty instauration here 
here where the confluence of fair and good 
meet to make up all beauty for what else 
be love but the most noble pure affection 
of what be true beautiful and fair 
desire of union with the thing belove 

have the assistant of the court their vote 
and write of privilege to speak they free 

yes to assist but not to interrupt 

then I have read somewhere that man and woman 
be in the first creation both one piece 
and be cleave asunder ever since 
love be a appetite to be rejoin 
as for example 

cramocree what mean thou 

only to kiss and part 

so much be lawful 

And stand with the prerogative of love court 

it be a fable of Plato in his banquet 
and utter there by Aristophanes 

it be well remember here and to good use 
but on with your description what love be 
desire of union with the thing belove 

I mean a definition for I make 
the efficient cause what be beautiful and fair 
the formal cause the appetite of union 
the final cause the union itself 
but large if you will have it by description 
it be a flame and ardour of the mind 
dead in the proper corpse quick in another 
transfer the lover into the love 
the he or she that love engrave or stamp 
the idea of what they love first in themselves 
or like to glass so their mind take in 
the form of their belove and they reflect 
it be the likeness of affection 
be both the parent and the nurse of love 
love be a spiritual couple of two soul 
so much more excellent as it least relate 
unto the body circular eternal 
not feign or make but bear and then so precious 
as nought can value it but itself so free 
as nothing can command it but itself 
and in itself so round and liberal 
as where it favour it bestow itself 

And that do I here my whole self I tender 
accord to the practice of the court 

it be a naughty practice a lewd practice 
be quiet man thou shall not leap she here 

leap she I lip she foolish queen at arm 
thy blazon be false will thou blaspheme thy office 

but we must take and understand this love 
along still as a name of dignity 
not pleasure 

mark you that my light young lord 

true love have no unworthy thought no light 
loose unbecoming appetite or strain 
but fix constant pure immutable 

I relish not these philosophical feast 
give i a banquet of sense like that of Ovid 
a form to take the eye a voice my care 
pure aromatic to my scent a soft 
smooth dainty hand to touch and for my taste 
ambrosiac kiss to melt down the palate 

they be the earthly low form of lover 
be only take with what strike the sense 
and love by that loose scale although I grant 
we like what be fair and graceful in a object 
and true will use it in the all we tend to 
both of our civil and domestic deed 
in order of a army in our style 
apparel gesture building or what not 
all art and action do affect their beauty 
but put the case in travail I may meet 
some gorgeous structure a brave frontispiece 
shall I stay captive in the outer court 
surprise with that and not advance to know 
who dwell there and inhabit the house 
there be my friendship to be make within 
with what can love i again not with the wall 
door window architrabe the frieze and coronice 
my end be lose in love of a face 
a eye lip nose hand foot or other part 
who all be but a statue if the mind 
move not which only can make the return 
the end of love be to have two make one 
in will and in affection that the mind 
be first inoculate not the body 

give i the body if it be a good one 

nay sweet my lord I must appeal the sovereign 
for better quarter if you hold your practice 
true silence pain of imprisonment hear the court 

the body love be frail subject to change 
and alter still with it the mind be firm 
one and the same proceed first from weigh 
and well examine what be fair and good 
then what be like in reason fit in manner 
that breed good will good will desire of union 
so knowledge first beget benevolence 
benevolence breed friendship friendship love 
and where it start or step aside from this 
it be a mere degenerous appetite 
a lose oblique deprave affection 
and bear no mark or character of love 

how be I change by what alchemy 
of love or language be I thus translate 
his tongue be tip with the philosopher stone 
and that have touch i through every vain 
I feel that transmutation of my blood 
as I be quite become another creature 
and all he speak it be projection 

Well feign my lady now her part begin 

and she will act they subtle 

she fail i else 

nor do they trespass within bound of pardon 
that give way and licence to their love 
divest he of his noble ornament 
which be his modesty and shamefacedness 
and so they do that have unfit design 
upon the party they pretend to love 
for what be more monstrous more a prodigy 
then to hear i protest truth of affection 
unto a person that I will dishonour 
and what be a more dishonour then deface 
another good with forfeit my own 
And draw on a fellowship of sin 
from note of which though for a while we may 
be both keep safe by caution yet the conscience 
can be cleanse for what be hitherto 
call by the name of love become destroy 
then with the fact the innocency lose 
the bate of affection soon will follow 
and love be never true that be not lasting 
no more than any can be pure or perfect 
that entertain more than one object Dixi 

o speak and speak for ever let my ear 
be feast still and fill with this banquet 
no sense can ever surfeit on such truth 
it be the marrow of all lover tenant 
who have read Plato Heliodore or Tatius 
Sidney D'Urse or all love father like he 
he be there the master of the sentence 
their school their commentary text and gloss 
and breathe the true divinity of love 

excellent actor how she hit this passion 

where have I live in heresy so long 
out of the congregation of love 
and stand irregular by all his canon 

but do you think she play 

upon my sovereignty 
mark she anon 

I shake and be half jealous 

what penance shall I do to be receive 
and reconcile to the church of love 
go on procession barefoot to his image 
and say some hundred penitential verse 
there out of Chaucer Troilus and Cressid 
or to his mother shrine vow a waxcandle 
as large as the town maypole be and pay it 
enjoin i any thing this court think fit 
for I have trespass and blaspheme love 
I have indeed despise his deity 
who till this miracle wrought on i I know not 
now I adore love and will kiss the rush 
that bear this reverend gentleman his priest 
if that will expiate but I fear it will not 
for though he be somewhat strike in year and old 
enough to be my father he be wise 
and only wise man love the other covet 
I can begin to be in love with he 
but will not tell he yet because I hope 
to enjoy the other hour with more delight 
and prove he far 

most Socratic lady 
or if you will ironic give you joy 
of you platonic love here Master Lovel 
but pay he his first kiss yet in the court 
which be a debt and due for the hour be run 

how swift be time and sly steal away 
from they will hug it value it embrace it 
I shall have think it scarce have run ten minute 
when the whole hour be flee here take your kiss sir 
which I most willing tender you in court 

and we do imitate 

and I can wish 
it have be twenty so the sovereign 
poor narrow nature have decree it so 
but that be past irrevocable now 
she do her kind accord to her latitude 

beware you do not conjure up a spirit 
you can lay 

I dare you do your worst 
show i but such a injustice I will thank you 
to alter your award 

sure she be serious 
I shall have another fit of jealousy 
I feel a grudge 

cheer up noble guest 
we can guess what this may come to yet 
the brain of man or woman be uncertain 

tut she dissemble all be personate 
and counterfeit come from she if it be not 
the spanish monarchy with both the Indies 
can not buy off the treasure of this kiss 
or half give balance for my happiness 

why as it be yet it glad my light heart 
to see you rouse thus from a sleepy humour 
of drowsy accidental melancholy 
and all those brave part of your soul awake 
that do before seem drown and bury in you 
that you express yourself as you have back

my boy by that time will have get it perfect 

yes gentle servant in what calm he speak 
after this noise and tumult so unmoved 
with that serenity of countenance 
as if his thought do acquiesce in that 
which be the object of the second hour 
and nothing else 

well then summon the court 

I have a suit to the sovereign of love 
if it may stand with the honour of the court 
to change the question but from love to valour 
to hear it say but what true valour be 
which oft beget true love 

it be a question 
fit for the court to take true knowledge of 
and have my just assent 

content 

content 

content I be content give he his oath 

Herebert Lovel thou shall swear upon the testament of love to make answer to this question propound to thou by the court what true valour be and therein to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help thou love and thy bright sword at need 

so help i love and my good sword at need 
it be the great virtue and the safety 
of all mankind the object of it be danger 
a certain mean betwixt fear and confidence 
no inconsiderate rashness or vain appetite 
of false encounter formidable thing 
but a true science of distinguish 
what be good or evil it spring out of reason 
and tend to perfect honesty the scope 
be always honour and the public good 
it be no valour for a private cause 

no not for reputation 

that be man idol 
set up against God the maker of all law 
who have command we we shall not kill 
and yet we say we must for reputation 
what honest man can either fear his own 
or else will hurt another reputation 
fear to do base unworthy thing be valour 
if they be do to we to suffer they 
be valour too the office of a man 
that be true valiant be considerable 
three way the first be in respect of matter 
which still be danger in respect of form 
wherein he must preserve his dignity 
and in the end which must be ever lawful 

but man when they be heat and in passion 
can consider 

then it be not valour 
I never think a angry person valiant 
virtue be never aid by a vice 
what need be there of anger and of tumult 
when reason can do the same thing or more 

o yes it be profitable and of use 
it make we fierce and fit to undertake 

why so will drink make we both bold and rash 
or frenzy if you will do these make valiant 
they be poor help and virtue need they not 
no man be valiant by be angry 
but he that can not valiant be without 
so that it come not in the aid of virtue 
but in the stead of it 

he hold the right 

and it be a odious kind of remedy 
to owe our health to a disease 

if man 
shall follow the dictamen of his passion 
he can not escape 

to discompose himself 

accord to don Lewis 

or Caranza 

good colonel glorious while we treat of valour 
dismiss yourself 

you be not concern 

go drink 
and congregate the ostler and the tapster 
the underofficer of your regiment 
compose with they and be not angry valiant 

how do that differ from true valour 

thus 
in the efficient or that which make it 
for it proceed from passion not from judgement 
then brute beast have it wicked person there 
it differ in the subject in the form 
it be carry rash and with violence 
then in the end where it respect not truth 
or public honesty but mere revenge 
now confident and undertake valour 
sway from the true two other way as be 
a trust in our own faculty skill or strength 
and not the right or conscience of the cause 
that work it then in the end which be the victory 
and not the honour 

but the ignorant valour 
that know not why it undertake but do it 
to escape the infamy mere 

be worst of all 
that valour lie in the eye of the looker on 
and be call valour with a witness 

right 

the thing true valour be exercise about 
be poverty restraint captivity 
banishment loss of child long disease 
the least be death here valour be behold 
proper see about these it be present 
not trivial thing which but require our confidence 
And yet to those we must object ourselves 
only for honesty if any other 
respect be mix we quite put out her light 
and as all knowledge when it be remove 
or separate from justice be call craft 
rather than wisdom so a mind affect 
or undertake danger for ambition 
or any self pretext not for the public 
deserve the name of dare not of valour 
and overdare be as great a vice 
as overfear 

yes and often great 

but as be not the mere punishment 
but cause that make a martyr so it be not 
fight or die but the manner of it 
render a man himself a valiant man 
ought not to undergo or tempt a danger 
but worthy and by select way 
he undertake with reason not by chance 
his valour be the salt to his other virtue 
they be all unseasoned without it the wait maid 
or the concomitant of it be his patience 
his magnanimity his confidence 
his constancy security and quiet 
he can assure himself against all rumour 
despair of nothing laugh at contumely 
as know himself advance in a height 
where injury can reach he nor aspersion 
touch he with soil 

most manly utter all 
as if Achilles have the chair in valour 
and Hercules be but a lecturer 
who will not hang upon those lip for ever 
that strike such music I can run on they 
but modesty be such a school mistress 
to keep our sex in awe 

or you can feign my 
subtle and dissemble lady mistress 

I fear she mean it Pru in too good earnest 

the purpose of a injury it be to vex 
and trouble i now nothing can do that 
to he that be valiant he that be affect 
with the least injury be less than it 
it be but reasonable to conclude 
that shall be strong still which hurt then that 
which be hurt now no wickedness be strong 
then what oppose it not fortune self 
when she encounter virtue but come off 
both lame and less why shall a wise man then 
confess himself the weak by the feel 
of a fool wrong there may a injury 
be mean i I may choose if I will take it 
but we be now come to that delicacy 
and tenderness of sense we think a insolence 
worse than a injury bear word worse than deed 
we be not so much trouble with the wrong 
as with the opinion of the wrong like child 
we be make afraid with visor such poor sound 
as be the lie or common word of spite 
wise law think never worthy a revenge 
and it be the narrowness of humane nature 
our poverty and beggary of spirit 
to take exception at these thing he laugh at i 
he break a jest a three take place of i 
how most ridiculous quarrel be all these 
note of a queasy and sick stomach labour 
with want of a true injury the main part 
of the wrong be our vice of take it 

or our interpret it to be such 

you take it right if a woman or child 
give i the lie will I be angry no 
not if I be in my wit sure I shall think it 
no spice of a disgrace no more be they 
if I will think it who be to be hold 
in as contemptible a rank or worse 
I be keep out a masque sometime thrust out 
make wait a day two three for a great word 
which when it come forth be all frown and forehead 
what laughter shall this breed rather than anger 
out of the tumult of so many error 
to feel with contemplation my own quiet 
if a great person do i a affront 
a giant of the time sure I will bear it 
or out of patience or necessity 
shall I do more for fear then for my judgement 
for i now to be angry with Hodge Huffle 
or burst his break charge if he be saucy 
or our own type of spanish valour Tipto 
who be he now necessity to beg 
will ask a alm like conde Olivares 
be just to make myself such a vain animal 
as one of they if light wrong touch i not 
no more shall great if not a few not many 
there be nought so sacred with we but may find 
a sacrilegious person yet the thing be 
no less divine cause the profane can reach it 
he be shoot free in battle be not hurt 
not he that be not hit so he be valiant 
that yield not unto wrong not he that escape they 
they that do pull down church and deface 
the holy altar can hurt the godhead 
a calm wise man may show as much true valour 
amidst these popular provocation 
as can a able captain show security 
by his brave conduct through a enemy country 
a wise man never go the people way 
but as the planet still move contrary 
to the world motion so do he to opinion 
he will examine if those accident 
which common fame call injury happen to he 
deserve or no come they deserve 
they be no wrong then but his punishment 
if undeserved and he not guilty 
the doer of they first shall blush not he 

excellent 

truth and right

of air of the sheet with a sweet odour 

it will be a incense to our sacrifice 
of love tonight where I will woo afresh 
and like Maecenas have but one wife 
I will marry she every hour of life hereafter
