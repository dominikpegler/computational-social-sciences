
trust i my lord Dorialus I have miss of this if you have not call i I think the princess birth day have be tomorrow 

why do your lordship sleep out the day 

I marvel what the duke mean to make such a idle vow 

idle why 

be it not idle to swear to grant his daughter any thing she shall ask on her birth day she may ask a impossible thing and I pray heaven she do not ask a unfit thing at one time or other it be dangerous trust a man vow upon the discretion on his daughter 

I wonder most at the marquess she brother who be always vehement forward to have her desire grant 

he be acquaint with they before 

she be doubtless very chaste and virtuous 

So be Leucippus her brother 

she be twenty year old I wonder 
she ask not a husband 

that be a folly in she have refuse all the 
great prince in one part of the world 
she will die a maid 

she may ask but one may she 

a hundred time this day if she will 
and indeed every day be such a day for though 
the duke have vow it only on this day 
he keep it every day he can deny 
her nothing 


Come fair Hidaspes thou be 
duchess today 
be thou prepare to ask thou know 
my oath will force performance 
and Leucippus if she now ask aught that shall 
or will have performance 
after my death when by the help of heaven 
this land be thou accurse be thy race 
may every one forget thou be my son 
and so their own obedience 

mighty sir 
I do not wish to know that fatal hour 
that be to make i king but if I do 
I shall most hasty and like a son 
perform your grant to all chief to she 
remember that you ask what we 
agree upon 

be you prepare then speak 

most royal sir I be prepare 
nor shall my will exceed a virgin bound 
what I request shall both at once bring 
i a full content 

so it ever do 
thou only comfort of my feeble age 
make know thy good desire 
for I dare swear thou love i 

this be it I beg 
and on my knee the people of your land 
the lycian be through all the nation 
that know their name note to have in use 
a vain and fruitless superstition 
so much more hateful that it bear the show 
of true religion and be nothing else 
but a selfpleasing bold lasciviousness 

what be it 

many age before this 
when every man get to himself a trade 
and be laborious in that choose course 
hate a idle life far worse than death 
some one that give himself to wine and sloth 
which breed lascivious thought 
and find himself conjoin 
for that by every painful man 
to take his stain away frame to himself 
a god who he pretend to obey 
in be thus dishonest for a name 
he call he Cupid This create god 
man nature be ever credulous 
of any vice that take part with his blood 
have ready follower enough and since 
in every age they grow especial 
among your subject who do yet remain 
adorer of that drowsy deity 
which drink invent and the wing boy 
for so they call he have his sacrifice 
these loose naked statute through the land 
and in every village nay the palace 
be not free from they this be my request 
that these erect obscene image 
may be pluck down and burn and every man 
that offer to they any sacrifice may lose his life 

but be advise my fair daughter if he be 
a god he will express it upon thou my child 
which heaven avert 

there be no such power 
but the opinion of he fill the land 
with lustful sin every young man and maid 
that feel the least desire to one another 
dare not suppress it for they think it be 
blind Cupid motion and he be a god 

This make our youth unchaste I be resolve 
nephew Ismenus break the statue down 
here in the palace and command the city 
do the like let proclamation 
be draw and hasty send through the land 
to the same purpose 

sir I will break down none myself 
but I will deliver your command 
hand I will have none in it for I like it not 

go and command it pleasure of my life 
will thou aught else make many thousand suit 
they must and shall be grant 

nothing else 

but go and meditate on other suit 
some six day hence I will give thou audience again 
and by a new oath bind myself to keep it 
ask large for thyself dear than life 
in who I may be bold to call myself 
more fortunate than any in my age 
I will deny thou nothing

through all good woman heart and then we have

that I may but use my conscience in my 
own house

the plague of hell light on he may he never 
govern this kingdom here I challenge he

this thousand year have be as chaste as she 
it will have make thou honest I stay 
to hear what you will say she be by heaven 
of the most strict and blameless chastity 
that ever woman be good god forgive i 
have Tarquin meet with she she have be kill 
with a slave by she ere she have agree 
I lie with she will I may perish then 
our mother who we all must reverence 
can never exceed she for her chastity 
upon my soul for by this light she be 
a most obstinate modest creature 

what do you with she then so long Leucip 

I will tell you sir you see she be beautiful 

I see it well 

move by her face 
I come with lustful thought 
which be a fault in i 
but tell truth something more pardonable 
and for the world I will not lie to you 
proud of myself I think a prince name 
have power to blow they down flat of their back 
but here I find a rock not to be shake 
for as I hope for good sir all the battery 
that I can lay to she or of my person 
my greatness or gold can nothing move she 

it be very strange be so young and fair 

she be almost thirty sir 

how do you know her age so just 

she tell it i herself 
once when she go about to show by reason 
I shall leave woo she 

she stain the ripe virgin of the age 

if I have sin with she I will be loath 
to publish her disgrace but by my life 
I will have tell it you because I think 
you will have pardon i the rather 
and I will tell you father by this light sir 
but that I never will bestow myself 
but to your like it she now will have i 
I now will marry she 

how be that Leucippus 

sir will you pardon i one fault which yet 
I have not do but have a will to do and I will tell it 

be it what it will I pardon thou 

I offer marriage to she 

do she refuse it 

with that earnestness and almost scorn 
to think of any other after her lose mate that she 
make methinks myself unworthy of she 

you have stay too long Leucippus 

yes sir forgive i heaven what multitude 
of oath have I bestow on lie and yet they be officious lie there be no malice in they 

she be the fair creature that ever I behold 
and then so chaste it be wonderful the more I look 
on she the more I be amaze 
I have long think of a wife and one I will have 
have but that I be afraid to meet a woman 
that may abuse my age but here she be 
who I may trust too of a chastity 
impregnable and approve so by my son 
the mean of her birth will still preserve she 
in due obedience and her beauty be 
of force enough to pull i back to youth 
my son once send away who rivalship 
I have just cause to fear if power or gold 
or wit can win she to i she be i 
nephew Ismenus I have new intelligence 
your province be unquiet still 

I be glad on it 

and so dangerous that I must send the 
prince in person with you 

I be glad of that too sir will you dispatch 
we we shall wither here for ever 

you shall be dispatch within this hour 
Leucippus never wonder nor ask it must be thus 
lady I ask your pardon who virtue I have 
slubber with my tongue and you shall ever be 
chaste in my memory hereafter 
but we old man often dote to make amends for 
my great fault receive that ring 
I be sorry for your grief may it soon leave you 
Come my lord let we go 

heaven bless your grace 
one that have but so much modesty leave as to blush 
or shrink a little at his first encounter 
have be undo where I come off with honour 
and gain too they that never will be track 
in any course by the most subtle sense 
must bear it through with frontlet impudence 

gentleman this be a strange piece of justice 
to put the wretched dwarf to death because 
she dote on he be she not a woman and 
subject to those mad fegary her whole sex 
be infect with have she love you or you or I 
or all on his as indeed the more the merry still 
with they must we therefore have our head pare 
with a hatchet so she may love all the nobility 
out of the dukedom in a month and let the rascal in

I wonder from whence this of the dwarf first spring 

from a old lecherous pair of breech that lie upon a wench to keep her warm for certain they be no man work and I be sure a monkey will get one of the guard to this fellow he be no big than a small portmanteau and much about that make if it have leg
