so do it at fourscore too when the soul be 
mew up in narrow darkness 
neither see nor hear 
pish it be mere fondness in our nature 
a certain clownish cowardice that still 
will stay at home and dare not venture 
into foreign country the better than

press by a warm hand 

a cordial of kind look from the king 
let we withdraw and hear he 

yet to be marry 
what be you mute now 

thou come too hasty upon i 
put too close the colour to my eye 
I can not see it be impossible 

impossible 
it be impossible it shall be otherwise 
what can you imagine there of constancy 
where it be so much their nature to love change 
that when they say but what they be 
they excuse themselves for what they do 

Shee hardly know he yet in such a instant 

o you know not how fire fly 
when it do catch light matter woman 

no more of that 
she be yet the pretious thing in all my thought 
I if it be so I be a lose thing in the world Doran 

How 

thou will in vain persuade i to be other 
life which to other be a good that they enjoy 
to i will be a evil I shall suffer 

look on another face that be present remedy 

how ill thou do conclude 
cause there be pestilent air which kill man sudden 
in health must there be sovereign 
as sudden to cure in sickness 
it never be in nature 
I be a fool to think 
death only keep the door of ill pay loan 
when or disdain or spite 
can let i out as well 

right be I as you 
it shall trouble i no more 
to free myself of love 
than to spit out that which make i sick 

I will tell she so that she may laugh at i 
as at a prisoner threaten his guard 
he will break loose and so be make the fast 
she have charm Doran 
can fetch in a rebellious heart 
even while it be conspire liberty 
oh she have all the virtue of her sex 
and not the vice 
chaste and unsullied 
as first open lily 
or untouched bud 

chaste why do you honour i 
because I throw myself not offend a precipice 
it be her ruin to be otherwise 
though we blame those that kill themselves 
we praise not he that keep himself alive 
that deserve nothing 

and it be the least 
she triumph when she do not appear 
I have as many rival as beholder 

all that increase but our jealousy 
if you have now such qualm for that you have not 
what will you have for that you shall possess 

dull heretic know I have these 
because I have not she 
when I have she I shall have these no more 
her fancy now her virtue then will govern 
and as I watch with doubtful eye 
the waver needle in the best sundial 
till it have settle than the trouble over 
because I know when it be fix it be true 
so here my doubt be all afore i 
sure Doran crown conqueror be 
but the type of lover which enjoy and real possess 
what other have in dream 
I will send a challenge to he 

do and be think a madman 
to what purpose 
if she love he she will but hate you more 
lover in favour Brennoralt be gamester 
in good fortune the more you set they 
the more they get 

I will see she then this night 
by heaven I will 

where in the citadel 

know what and why 

he rave Brennoralt 

let i alone 
I conjure thou by the discretion 
leave betwixt we that be thou 
for i be divorce by injury of fortune 
leave i to myself 

I have do 

be there such a passage 
as thou have tell i of into the castle

and dare thou let i in 

if you my lord dare venture 

there be no sentry near it 

None 

How to the chamber afterward

a wicket to my lady secret 
one that stand up to marriage with i 

there upon thy life be secret fling he a purse 

else all punishment due to ingratitude 

enough 
I be a storm within till I be there 
oh Doran 
that that which be so pleasant to behold 
shall be such pain within 

poor Brennoralt 
thou be still the martyr of a thousand tyrant 
love honour and ambition reign by turn 
and show their power upon thou 

why let they I be still brennoralt 
even king themselves be by their 
servant rule sometime 
let their own slave govern at odd hour 
yet not subject their person or their power 

what have I get by change place 
but as a wretch which venture to the war 
seek the misery with pain abroad 
he find but wise think 
and have leave at home weep 
fortune thou have no tyranny 
beyond this usage 
will I have never hope 
or have betimes despair 
let never in the gentle thief 
or keep he but a guest 
not make he lord at all 
thus as my storm of grief 
carry my tear which shall relieve my heart 
have hurry to the thankless ocean cloud 
and shower which need not at all the courtesy 
when the poor plain have languish 
for the want and almost burst asunder 
I will have this statue place and undertake 
at my own charge to keep the water full 

these fond impression grow too strong upon i 
they be at first without design or end 
like the first element that know not what 
and why they act and yet produce strange thing 
poor innocent desire journey they know 
not whither but now they promise to themselves 
strange thing grow insolent threaten no rest 
till they be satisfy 
what difference be between these lord 
the one make love as if he by assault 
will take my heart so force it to defence 
while tother blow it up with secret mine 
and leave no place for it here he be 
Tear steal too from his eye 
as if not dare to be know 
to pass that way make it good cunning grief 
thou know thou can not dress thyself 
in any other look to make thou lovely 

Francelia if through the ignorance of place 
I have intrude on your privacy 
find out forbid path 
it be fit you pardon madam 
for it be my melancholy not I offend 

so great a melancholy will well become 
mischance such as time can repair 
those of the war be but the petty 
cure of every come hour 

why shall I not now tell she all since it be in she 
to save my life who know but she may be 
gallant so far as to undo herself 
to make another happy 
madam the accident of war 
contribute least to my sad thought 
if any such I have 
imprisonment can never be 
where the place hold what we more love 
and yet 

my lord 

in this imprisonment 

proceed my lord 

I dare not madam 

I see I do disturb you and enter upon your secret 
which when I know I can serve you in 

o most of any 
you be the cause of all 

I my lord 

you madam you alone 

Alas that it be too soon to understand 

must not you marry Almerin 

they tell i it be design 

if he have you I be for ever lose 

lose the heaven forbid they shall design so ill 
or when they shall that I shall be the cause 

ha her eye be strange kind 
she prompt i excellent 
star be propitious and I be safe 
away I will not expect it 

his passion labour for vent 

be there a hope you will not give yourself 
to Almerin 

my lord this air be common 
the walk within be pleasant 

invitation God of desire be kind 
and fill i now with language 
such as thou lend thy favorite 
when thou will give they easy victory 
and I forgive thou all thy cruelty 

Consider too 
that those who be so necessitate to use violence 
have first be violent by necessity 

but still you judge not right of the prerogative 
for oft it stand with power and law 
as with our faith and reason 
it be not still against that be above my lord 

you have of all least reason 
for will the king be unjust he can 
where there be so little to be have 

where there be least there be liberty my lord 
and it be more injury to pull hair 
from the bald then from the bushy head 

Brennoralt a word 
my lord the world have cast its eye upon you 
and mark you out one of the foremost man 
you have bury fame the early of any 
and send she still on errand 
much of the bravery of the nation 
have take up its lodging in you 
and gallant man but copy from you 

it be goodly language this what will it mean 

the lithuanian wish you well and wonder 
so much desert shall be so ill reward 

good 

while all the gift the crown be master of 
be place upon the empire 

still I take you not 

then to be plain 
our army will be proud of you 
pay the neglect score of merit double 
all that you hold here of command and what 
your fortune in this Sigismond have suffer 
repair and make it fair than it be at first 

how 
that nothing lord trifle below ill language 
how come it in thy heart to tempt my honour 

my lord 

do think cause I be angry 
with the king and state sometime 
I be fall out with virtue and myself 
draw draw or by goodness 

what mean your lordship 

draw I say 
he that will think i villain be one 
and I do wear this toy to purge the world 
of such they have save thou 
be it thou good nature thou will 
love a king the better during life 

if they be just 
they call for gracious answer 
speedy however we promise 

long live great 〈◊〉 

the 〈◊〉 sir be of the wild sort of creature 
must be rid with harsh curb and since the war 
can only make they try what can be use but 
sword where man have fall 
from not respect royalty 
unto a liberty of offend it 
what though their number equal you sir 
and now force by necessity 
like cut in narrow room 
they fly upon your face 
think you rebellion and loyalty 
be empty name and that in subject heart 
they give not both and take away the courage 
shall we believe there be no difference 
in good and bad no punishment 
nor no protection forbid it heaven 
if when great Poland honour safety too 
hang in dispute we shall not draw our sword 
why be we ever teach to wear they sir 

this late commotion in your kingdom sir 
be like a grow wen upon the face 
which as we can look on without trouble 
so take it away we can without danger 
war there have foul face and I 
must fear it where the pretext be fair 
religion and liberty 
most specious name 
which like the bill of subtle mountebank 
fill with great promise of cure all 
though by the wise pass by unread as common cozenage 
yet by the unknowing multitude 
they be still admire and flock to 

be there no way to disabuse they 

a i now too late 
the vulgar in religion be 
like unknown land 
and those that first possess they have they 
then sir consider justness of cause be nothing 
when thing be rise to the point they be 
it be either not examine or believe 
among the world 
the better cause the grecian have of old 
yet be the god themselves divide in it 
and the foul ravisher find as good protection 
as the much injure husband 
nor be you sir assure of all behind you 
for though your person in the subject heart 
stand high honour and beloved 
yet be there certain act of state 
which man call grievance abroad 
and though they bear they in the time of peace 
yet will they now perchance think to be free 
and throw they off for sir 
the common people be much like the sea 
which suffer thing to fall 
and sink unto the bottom in a calm 
which in a storm 
stir and enrage it lift and do keep up 
then time 
distemper cure more safe sir then physic 
or instant let blood religion now 
be a young mistress there for which each man will fight 
and die at least let it alone a while 
and it will become a kind of marry wife 
people will be content to live with it 
in quietness if that at least may be 
my voice be therefore sir for peace 

Were sir the question simple war or peace 
it be no more than short to be ask 
whether we will be well or ill 
since war the sickness of a kingdom be 
and peace the health 
but here I do conceive 
it will rather be whether we have not better 
endure sharp sickness for a time to enjoy 
a perfect strength then have it languish on we 
for peace and war be a incestuous line 
have still beget each other 
those man that high now have break all law 
the great one only it be twixt man and man 
what safety can they promise though they give it 
Will they not still suspect and just too 
that all those bond shall be 
break again to they so be still in fear 
and jealousy themselves they must infect 
the people for in such a case 
the private safety be a public trouble 
nor will they ever want pretext 
since he that will 
maintain it with his sword he be injure 
may say it at any time 
then sir as terrible as war appear 
my vote be for it nor shall I ever care 
how ugly my physician shall be 
so he can do the cure 

in enter physic 
I think sir none so much consider 
the doctor face as his own body 
to keep on foot the war with all the want 
be to let blood and take strong potion 
in dangerous sickness 

I see a wonder not to find my lord 
this difference in opinion the subject vbz large 
nor can we there too much dispute where when 
we err it be at a kingdom charge 
peace and war be in themselves indifferent 
and time do stamp they either good or bad 
but here the place be much considerable 
war in our own 
be like to heat within it make the body sick 
when in another country it be but exercise 
convey that heat abroad and give it health 
to that I bend my thought 
but leave it to our great counsel 
which we now assemble 
mean time exchange of prisoner only we assent to 

nothing of truce sir 

no 
we will not take up quiet at interest 
perfect peace or nothing 
cessation for short time in war 
be like small fit of health 
in dangerous sickness 
which while the instant pain seem to abate 
flatter we in debauch and worse estate 

I have not leave myself a fair retreat 
and must be now either the bless object 
of your love or subject of your scorn 

I fear some treachery 
and that my eye have give intelligence 
unless you know there will be weak defence 
you dare not think of take in a heart 
as soon as you sit down before it 

condemn my love not of such fond ambition 
it aim not at a conquest but Francelia 

they be very great in this short time 

it be ever so 
young and handsome 
have make acquaintance in nature 
so when they meet they have the less to do 
it be for age or ugliness to make approach 
or keep a distance 

when I shall see other perfection 
which at the best will be but other vanity not more 
I shall not love it 

it be still one step not to despair my lord 

do think he will fight 

troth it may be not 
nature in those fine piece do as painter 
hang out a pleasant excellence 
that take the eye which be indeed 
but a course canvas in the naked truth 
or some slight stuff 

I have a great mind to taste he 

fie a prisoner 

by this hand if I think he court my 
colonel mistress in earnest 

my lord my lord 
my lady think the jessamine walk 
will be fine the freshness 
of the morning take off the strength 
of the heat she say 

it be well 

Mew do it so I suspect vild 
we will follow he and see it he be 
so far qualify towards a soldier 
as to drink a in his chamber 

where be those key 

hark you I dare not do it 

how 

my lady will find 

scruple 
be my hope your fear 
there be no other way I shall be any thing 
in this loud world and now 
'sfoot I know she long to see he too 

do she 

do think he will desire it else 

ay but 

why let i secure it all 
I will say I find the key or steal they come 

well if you ruin all now 
here these enter the garden from the work 
that the privy walk and that the backstairs 
than you know my chamber 

yes I know your chamber 

he come not 
one wise thought more and I return 
I can in this art separate the foolish 
from the bold so far but still it taste 
of the rash 
why let it taste it taste of love too 
and to all action it give a pretty relish that 

my lord 

o here 

'sfoot you be upon our sentry 
more on this hand 

why be there here no guard 

there need none 
you present must pass a place 
whereon a army in defence 
it be so steep and straight 

it be well 

these be the step of danger 
look to your way my lord 

I do not find such difficulty 
wait i thereabouts 
so miser look upon their gold 
which while they joy to see they fear to lose 
the pleasure of the sight scarce equal 
the jealousy of be dispossess by other 
her face be like the milky way in the sky 
a meeting of gentle light without name 
heaven shall this fresh ornament of the world 
this precious loveliness 
pass with other common thing 
among the waste of time 

bless i 
it be a vision or Brennoralt 

Brennoralt lady 

Brennoralt ignorance guard i 
what be it you have do my lord 

Alas I be but in too good estate 
if I know what I do 
but why ask you madam 

it much amaze i to think 
how you come hither 
and what can bring you too in danger thus 
my honour and your own life 
nothing but save of my brother 
can make i now preserve you 

reproach i not the folly you yourself 
make i commit 
I be reduce to such extremity 
that love himself high tyrant as he be 
if he can see will pity i 

I understand you not 

will heaven you do for it be a pain to tell you 
I come to accuse you of injustice madam 
you first beget my passion 
and be content at least you seem so 
that it shall live 
yet since never will contribute unto it 
nor look upon it as if you have desire 
it be for no other end 
but for the pleasure of its ruin 

why do you labour that to make i guilty of 
a injury to you which when it be one 
all mankind be alike engage 
and must have quarrel to i 

I have do ill you chide i just madam 
I will lay it not on you but on my wretched self 
for I be teach that heavenly body 
be not malicious in their influence 
but by the disposition of the subject 
they tell i you must marry Almerin 
sure such excellency ought to be 
the recompense of virtue 
not the sacrifice of parent wisdom 
shall it not madam 

it will injure i 
be it think otherwise 

and shall he have you then 
that know you yesterday 
be there in martyrdom no just way 
but this that hold a finger in the fire 
a little time shall the crown from they 
that have endure the flame with constancy 

if the discovery will ease your thought my lord 
know Alemerin be the man I never see 

you do not marry then condemn man 
thus hear and thus receive reprieve 
one question more and I be go 
be there to latitude of eternity 
a hope for Brennoralt 

my lord 

have I place at all when you do think of man 

my lord a high one 
I must be singular do I not value you 
the world do set great rate upon you 
and you have first deserve they 

be this all 

all 

o be less kind or kind 
give i more pity or more cruelty Francelia 
I can live without this nor die 

I fear my lord 
you must not hope beyond it 

not hope 
this be not sure the body to this soul 
it be mistake shuffle in through haste 
why else shall that have so much love 
and this want love line to make that love 
receive I will raise honour to a point 
it never be 
do thing of such a victorious greatness 
she shall love i she shall 
I will deserve she though I have she not 
there be something yet in that 
madam will please you pardon my offence 
o fate that I must call thus my affection 

I will do any thing so you will think of i 
and of yourself my lord and how your stay 
endanger both 

Alas your pardon be more necessary to myself 
than life be to i but I be go 
blessing such as my wish for you in 
their ecstasy can never reach fall on you 
may every thing contribute to preserve 
your excellence my destruction 
great as the torment I have in it 

why so it be well fortune I think thou still 
I dare not call thou villain neither 
it be plot from the first 
that be certain it look that way 
humh catch in a trap 
here be something yet to trust to 
this be the entry these the stair 
but whither afterward 
he that be sure to perish on the land 
may quit the nicety of card and compass 
and safe to his discretion put to sea 
he shall have my hand to it 

look by this light it be day 

not by this by other it be indeed 

thou be such another piece of temptation 
my lord rave by this time 
a hundred to one the sentinel will discover 
they too then do I pay for nightwatch 

fie upon thou thou be as fearful as a 
young colt boil at every thing fool as 
if lover consider hour I will peep in 

I be as weary of this wench 
as if I be marry to she 
she hang upon i like a ape upon a horse 
she be as common too as a barber glass 
conscienced like a didapper 

Raguelin there be nobody within

to view the wall or trench it be but

my lord we will take the near way and 
privater here through the sally port

how can he come there else 

friend or no friend he may have

and bless my star they give i power to do 
the debt lie heavy on i 
a horse wait you there a trumpet too 
which you may keep lest he shall prate 
no ceremony it be dangerous

thy youth have triumph in one single act 
of eal the age can boast and I will stay 
to tell thou so be they now fire 
all their cannon on i 
farewell gallant Fresolin 
and may reward great as thy virtue crown thou 

a peace will come 
and than thou must be go 
and whither when you be once get upon the wing 
you will not stoop to what shall rise 
before you fly to some lure 
with more temptation garnish 

can you have doubt and I have not my fear 
by this the ready and the sweet oath I swear 
I can so secure myself of you 
but in my absence I shall be in pain 
I have cast up what it will be to stand 
the governors anger and which be more hard 
the love of Almerin 
I hold thou now but by thy own free grant 
a slight security alas it may fall out 
give thyself not know thy own worth 
or want of i thou may like one deceive 
resume the gift on better knowledge back 

if I so easy change I be 
not worth your love 
and by that loss you will gain 

but when you be irrecoverable go 
it will be slight comfort to persuade myself 
you have a fault when all that fault must be 
but want of love to i and that again 
find in my much defect so much excuse 
that it will have no worse name 
than indiscretion if I inconcerned do 
cast it up I must have more assurance 

you have too much already 
and sure my lord you wonder while I blush 
at such a growth in young perfection 

why shall I wonder madam

and be they all lock up you be a spy 
once enter in my chamber at strange hour 

the virtue of Francelia be too safe 
to need this little art of preservation 
thus to divide ourselves be to distract ourselves 
a cherubin dispatch not on earth 
the affair of heaven with great innocence 
than I will visit it be but to take a leave 
I beg 

when you be go my lord 

pish thou lie thou lie

that melt when man but take she by the hand 
eye full and quick with breath 
sweet as double violet 
and wholesome as die strawberry 
thick silken eyebrow high upon the forehead 
and cheek mingle with pale streak of red 
such as the blush morning never wear

with narrow mouth small tooth 
and lip swell as if she pout

and rustle in one chamber 

o good granivert good granivert 

with a wax candle in her hand 
look as if she have lose she way 
at twelve at night 

o any hour any hour
