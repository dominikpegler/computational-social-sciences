that comfort can express from natural love 
since thy birthjoy a mother chief gladness 
after she have undergo her curse of sorrow

present thou to my heart welcome again 

alas poor affectionate soul how her joy speak to i

the fortune common of knavish child 
to have the love mother 

what be this gentlewoman 

speak low sweet mother you be able to spoil as many 
as come within the hear if it be not 
your fortune to mar all I have much marvel 
I pray do not you teach she to rebel 
when she be in a good way to obedience 
to rise with other woman in commotion 
against their husband for six gown a year 
and so maintain their cause when they be once up 
in all thing else that require cost enough 
they be all of they a kind of spirit soon raise 
but not so soon lay mother as for example 
a woman belly be get up in a trice 
a simple charge ere it be lay down again 
so ever in all their quarrel and their course 
and I be a proud man I hear nothing of they 
they be very still I thank my happiness 
and sound asleep pray let not your tongue wake they 
if you can but rest quiet she be content 
with all condition that my fortune bring she to 
to keep close as a wife that love her husband 
to go after the rate of my ability 
not the licentious swinge of her own will 
like some of her old schoolfellow she intend 
to take out other work in a new sampler 
and frame the fashion of a honest love 
which know no want but mock poverty 
bring forth more child to make rich man wonder 
at divine providence that feed mouth of infant 
and send they none to feed but stuff their room 
with fruitful bag their bed with barren womb 
good mother make not you thing worse than they be 
out of your too much openness pray take heed on it 
nor imitate the envy of old people 
that strive to mar good sport because they be perfect 
I will have you more pitiful to youth 
especial to your own flesh and blood 
I will prove a excellent husband here be my hand 
lay in provision follow my business roundly 
and make you a grandmother in forty week 
go pray salute she bid she welcome cheerful 

gentlewoman thus much be a debt of courtesy 
which fashionable stranger pay each other 
at a kind meeting then there be more than one 
due to the knowledge I have of your nearness 
I be bold to come again and now salute you 
by the name of daughter which may challenge more 
than ordinary respect 

why this be well now 
and I think few mother of threescore will mend it 

what I can bid you welcome to be mean 
but make it all your own we be full of want 
and can welcome worth 

now this be scurvy 
and speak as if a woman lack her tooth 
these old folk talk of nothing but defect 
because they grow so full of they themselves 

kind mother there be nothing can be want 
to she that do enjoy all her desire 
heaven send a quiet peace with this man love 
and I be as rich as virtue can be poor 
which be enough after the rate of mind 
to erect temple for content place here 
I have forsake friend fortune and my country 
and hourly I rejoice in it here be my friend 
and few be the good number thy success 
however they look I will still name my fortune 
hopeful or spiteful they shall all be welcome 
who invite many guest have of all sort 
as he that traffic much drink of all fortune 
yet they must all be welcome and use well 
I will call this place the place of my birth now 
and right too for here my love be bear 
and that be the birthday of a woman joy

though my own care and my rich master trust 
lay their command both on my factorship 
this day and night I will know no other business 
but she and her dear welcome it be a bitterness 
to think upon tomorrow that I must leave she 
still to the sweet hope of the week end 
that pleasure shall be so restrain and curb 
after the course of a rich workmaster 
that never pay till Saturday night 
marry it come together in a round sum then 
and do more good you will say o fair eye Florence 
do thou but know what a most matchless jewel 
thou now be mistress of a pride will take thou 
able to shoot destruction through the blood

o soft there brother though you be a justice 
your warrant can be serve out of your liberty 
you may compel out of the power of father 
thing mere harsh to a maid flesh and blood 
but when you come to love there the soil alter 
you be in another country where your law 
be no more set by than the cackle 
of goose in Rome great capitol 

marry he she shall then 
let she agree upon love afterward

that walk upon the earth with a staff

why how can I obey and honour he 
but I must needs commit idolatry 
a fool be but the image of a man 
and that but ill make neither o the heartbreaking 
of miserable maid where love be enforce 
the best condition be but bad enough 
when woman have their choice common 
they do but buy their thraldom and bring great portion 
to man to keep they in subjection 
as if a fearful prisoner shall bribe 
the keeper to be good to he yet lie in still 
and glad of a good usage a good look 
sometime by our lady no misery surmount a woman 
Men buy their slave but woman buy their master 
yet honesty and love make all this happy 
and next to angel the most bless estate 
that providence that he have make every poison 
good for some use and set four war element 
at peace in man can make a harmony 
in thing that be most strange to humane reason 
o but this marriage what be you sad too uncle

Alas how shall I trust your love hereafter

and the main point forget we be too blame both

and faulty on both part let we lose no time now

farewell all friendly solace and discourse 
I will learn to live without you for your danger 
be great than your comfort what be become 
of truth in love if such we can trust 
when blood that shall be love be mix with lust 

the worst can be but death and let it come 
he that live joyless every day be his doom 

methinks I be even as dull now at departure 
as man observe great gallant the next day 
after a revel you shall see they look 
much of my fashion if you mark they well 
it be even a second hell to part from pleasure 
when man have get a smack on it as many holiday 
come together make your poor head idle 
a great while after and be say to stick 
fast in their finger end even so do game 
in a new marry couple for the time

to invent all the new way for great expense Brancha and mother above

and stay with she continual be it a match 
o fie what a religion have I leap into 
get out again for shame the man love best 
when his care be most that show his zeal to love 
fondness be but the idiot to affection 
that play at hotcockle with rich merchant wife 
good to make sport withal when the chest be full 
and the long ware house crack it be time of day 
for we to be more wise it be early with we 
and if they lose the morning of their affair 
they common lose the best part of the day 
those that be wealthy and have get enough 
it be after sunset with they they may rest 
grow fat with ease banquet and toy and play 
when such as I enter the heat of the day 
and I will do it cheerful 

I perceive sir

but love that be wanton must be rule a while 
by that that be careful or all go to ruin 
as fit be a government in love 
as in a kingdom where it be all mere lust 
it be like a insurrection in the people 
that raise in selfwill war against all reason 
but love that be respective for increase 
be like a good king that keep all in peace 
once more farewell 

but this one night I prithee 

Alas I be in for twenty if I stay

his absence can last five day at utmost 
why shall those tear be fetch forth can love

but it must see her face still in a fountain 
it show like a country maid dress her head 
by a dish of water come it be a old custom 
to weep for love 

now they come now they come 

the duke 

the state 

how near boy 

in the next street sir hard at hand

the best in all the city 

I have it for her sir

what be the meaning of this hurry 
can you tell mother 

what a memory 
have I I see by that year come upon i 
why it be a yearly custom and solemnity 
religious observe by the duke and state 
to St mark temple the fifteen of April 
see if my dull brain have not quite forget it 
it be happy question of thou I have go down else 
sit like a drone below and never think on it 
I will not to be ten year young again 
that you have lose the sight now you shall see 
our duke a goodly gentleman of his year 

be he old then 

about some fifty five 

that be no great age in man he be then at best 
for wisdom and for judgement 

the lord cardinal 
his noble brother there be a comely gentleman 
and great in devotion then in blood 

he be worthy to be mark 

you shall behold 
all our chief state of Florence you come fortunate 
against this solemn day 

I hope so always 

I hear they near we now do you stand easy 

exceed well good mother 

take this stool 

I need it not I thank you 

use your will then 

how like you daughter 

it be a noble state 
methinks my soul can dwell upon the reverence 
of such a solemn and most worthy custom 
do not the duke look up methought he see we 

that be every one conceit that see a duke 
if he look steadfast he look straight at they 
when he perhaps good careful gentleman 
never mind any but the look he cast 
be at his own intention and his object 
only the public good 

most likely so 

Come come we will end this argument below 

a strange affection brother when I think on it 
I wonder how thou come by it 

even as easy 
as man come by destruction which ofttimes 
he wear in his own bosom 

be the world 
so populous in woman and creation 
so prodigal in beauty and so various 
yet do love turn thy point to thy own blood 
it be somewhat too unkind must thy eye 
dwell evil on the fairness of thy kindred 
and seek not where it shall it be confine 
now in a narrow prison then be make for it 
it be allow a stranger and where bounty 
be make the great man honour it be ill husbandry 
to spare and servant shall have small thank for it 
so he heaven bounty seem to scorn and mock 
that spare free mean and spend of his own stock 

never be man misery so soon sow up 
count how true 

nay I love you so 
that I shall venture much to keep a change from you 
so fearful as this grief will bring upon you 
faith it even kill i when I see you faint 
under a reprehension and I will leave it 
though I know nothing can be better for you 
prithee sweet brother let not passion waste 
the goodness of thy time and of thy fortune 
thou keep the treasure of that life I love 
as dear as i own and if you think 
my former word too bitter which be minister 
by truth and zeal it be but a hazard 
of grace and virtue and I can bring forth 
as pleasant fruit as sensuality wish 
in all her teem long this I can do 

o nothing that can make my wish perfect 

I will that love of you be pawn to it brother 
and as soon lose that way as I can win 
sir I can give as shrewd a lift to chastity 
as any she that wear a tongue in Florence 
she have need be a good horsewoman and sit fast 
who my strong argument can not fling at last 
prithee take courage man though I shall counsel 
another to despair yet I be pitiful 
to thy affliction and will venture hard 
I will not name for what it be not handsome 
find you the proof and praise i 

then I fear i 
I shall not praise you in haste 

this be the comfort 
you be not the first brother have attempt 
thing more forbid than this seem to be 
I will minister all cordial now to you 
because I will cheer you up sir 

I be past hope 

love thou shall see i do a strange cure then 
as ever be wrought on a disease so mortal 
and near akin to shame when shall you see she 

never in comfort more 

you be so impatient too 

will you believe death she have forswear my company 
and seal it with a blush 

So I perceive 
all lie upon my hand then well the more glory 
when the work finish how now sir the news 

madam your niece the virtuous Isabella 
be light now to see you 

that be great fortune 
sir your star bless you simple lead she in 

what be this to i

beshrew you will I love you not so well 
I will go to bed and leave this deed undo 
I be the fond where I once affect 
the carefull of their health and of their ease forsooth 
that I look still but slender to my own 
I take a course to pity he so much now 
that I have none leave for modesty and myself 
this it be to grow so liberal you have few sister 
that love their brother ease above their own honesty 
but if you question my affection 
that will be find my fault niece your love be welcome 
Alas what draw that paleness to thy cheek 
this enforce marriage towards 

it help good aunt 
among some other grief but those I will keep 
lock up in modest silence for they be sorrow 
will shame the tongue more than they grieve the thought 

Indeed the ward be simple 

simple that be well 
why one may make good shift with such a husband 
but he be a fool entail he halt downright in it 

And know this I hope it be at your choice 
to take or refuse niece 

you see it be not 
I loathe he more than beauty can hate death 
or age her spiteful neighbour 

let we appear then 

how can I be bear with that obedience 
that must submit unto a father will 
if he command I must of force consent 

alas poor soul be not offend prithee 
if I set by the name of niece a while 
and bring in pity in a strange fashion 
it lie here in this breast will cross this match 

how cross it aunt 

ay and give thou more liberty 
than thou have reason yet to apprehend 

sweet aunt in goodness keep not hide from i 
what may befriend my life

not wrong secrecy or reputation 

neither of which as I have hope of fruitness 
shall receive wrong from i

I can find yet in this sweet aunt deal plain

save what the courtesy of opinion cast 
upon your mother memory and your name

wish more instruction and I have your oath 
in pledge for silence it make i talk the free 
do never the report of that fame Spaniard

and be I somewhat deaf when you speak 
it be never awhit the worse for my quietness 
it be the most sudden strange alteration 
and the most subtle that ever wit at threescore 
be puzzle to find out I know no cause for it but 
she be no more like the gentlewoman at first 
than I be like she that never lie with man yet 
and she be a very young thing where ere she be 
when she first light here I tell she then 
how mean she shall find all thing she be please forsooth 
none better I lay open all defect to she 
she be content still but the devil be in she 
nothing content she now tonight my son 
promise to be at home will he be come once 
for I be weary of my charge and life too 
she will be serve all in silver by her good will 
by night and day she hate the name of pewterer 
more than sickman the noise or disease bone 
that quake at fall of the hammer seem to have 
a fellowfeeling with it at every blow 
what course shall I think on she fret i so 

how near be I now to a happiness 
that earth exceed not not another like it 
the treasure of the deep be not so precious 
as be the conceal comfort of a man 
lock up in woman love I send the air 
of blessing when I come but near the house 
what a delicious breath marriage send forth 
the violetbed not sweet honest wedlock 
be like a banquetinghouse build in a garden 
on which the spring chaste flower take delight 
to cast their modest odour when base lust 
with all her powder painting and best pride 
be but a fair house build by a ditch side 
when I behold a glorious dangerous strumpet 
sparkle in beauty and destruction too 
both at a twinkle I do liken straight 
her beautify body to a goodly temple 
that be build on vault where carcase lie rot 
and so by little and little I shrink back again 
and quench desire with a cool meditation 
and I be as well methinks now for a welcome 
able to draw man envy upon man 
a kiss now that will hang upon my lip 
as sweet as morning due upon a rose 
and full as long after a five day fast 
she will be so greedy now and cling about i 
I take care how I shall be rid of she 
and here it begin 

o sir you be welcome home 

o be he come I be glad on it

to come and speak with i he shall know then 
the infinite wealth he have and discern right 
the greatness of his treasure by my loss

that wear his youth out in a strumpet arm 
and never spend more care upon a woman 
then at the time of lust but walk away 
and if he find her dead at his return 
his pity be soon do he break a sigh 
in many part and give she but a piece on it

to reward good thing ay and bear a conscience to it 
can thou love such a one that blow all fortune

her strange departure stand like a hearse yet 
before his eye which time will take down short

when only that which make she so have leave she 
I can love she now but I must like 
her sin and my own shame too and be guilty

then bounteous housekeeper purchase their honour 
nothing sad i so much as that in love 
to thou and to thy blood I have pick out 
a worthy match for she the great Vincentio 
high in our favour and in all man thought 

o thou destruction of all happy fortune 
unsated blood know you the name my lord 
of her abuser 

one Leantio

give she good counsel make she see her error 
I know she will hearken to you 

yes my lord 
I make no doubt as I shall take the course 
which she shall never know till it be act 
and when she wake to honour then she will thank i for it 
I will imitate the pity of old surgeon 
to this lose limb who ere they show their art 
cast one asleep then cut the disease part 
so out of love to she I pity most 
she shall not feel he go till he be lose 
then she will commend the cure

I count this do already his wrath be sure 
and speak a injury deep farewell Leantio 
this place will never hear thou murmur more 
our noble brother welcome

fix in his look nay it incline a little 
to the dark colour of a discontentment 
brother what be it command your eye so powerful 
speak you seem lose 

the thing I look on seem so 
to my eye lose for ever 

you look on i 

what a grief it be to a religious feel 
to think a man shall have a friend so goodly 
so wise so noble nay a duke a brother 
and all this certain damn 

how 

it be no wonder 
if your great sin can do it dare you look up 
for think of a vengeance dare you sleep 
for fear of never wake but to death 
and dedicate unto a strumpet love 
the strength of your affection zeal and health 
here you stand now can you assure your pleasure 
you shall once more enjoy she but once more 
alas you can what a misery it be then 
to be more certain of eternal death 
then of a next embrace nay shall I show you 
how more unfortunate you stand in sin 
than the love private man all his offence 
like enclose ground keep but about himself 
and seldom stretch beyond his own soul bound 
and when a man grow miserable it be some comfort 
when he be not further charge then with himself 
it be a sweet ease to wretchedness but great man 
every sin thou commit show like a flame 
upon a mountain it be see far about 
and with a big wind make of popular breath 
the sparkle fly through city here one take 
another catch there and in short time 
waste all to cinder but remember still 
what burn the valley first come from the hill 
every offence draw his particular pain 
but it be example prove the great man bane 
the sin of mean man lie like scatter parcel 
of a unperfect bill but when such fall 
then come example and that sum up all 
and this your reason grant if man of good life 
who by their virtuous action stir up other 
to noble and religious imitation 
receive the great glory after death 
as sin must needs confess what may they feel 
in height of torment and in weight of vengeance 
not only they themselves not do well 
but set a light up to show man to hell 

if you have do I have no more sweet brother 

I know time spend in goodness be too tedious

how dare you venture on eternal pain 
that can bear a minute reprehension 
methinks you shall endure to hear that talk of 
which you so strive to suffer o my brother 
what be you if you be take now 
my heart weep blood to think on it it be a work 
of infinite mercy you can never merit 
that yet you be not deathstruck no not yet 
I dare not stay you long for fear you shall not 
have time enough allow you to repent in 
there be but this wall betwixt you and destruction 
when you be at strong and but poor thin clay 
think upon it brother can you come so near it 
for a fair strumpet love and fall into 
a torment that know neither end nor bottom 
for beauty but the deepness of a skin 
and that not of their own neither be she a thing 
who sickness dare not visit or age look on 
or death resist do the worm shun her grave 
if not as your soul know it why shall lust 
bring man to last pain for rot dust 

brother of spotless honour let i weep 
the first of my repentance in thy bosom 
and show the bless fruit of a thankful spirit 
and if I ere keep woman more unlawful 
may I want penitence at my great need 
and wiseman know there be no barren place 
threaten more famine than a dearth in grace 

why here be a conversion be at this time brother 
sing for a hymn in heaven and at this instant 
the power of darkness groan make all hell sorry 
first I praise heaven then in my work I glory 
who be there attend without

take up those light there be a thick darkness 
when they come first the peace of a fair soul 
keep with my noble brother 

joy be with you sir

though it be hard to conquer but I have vow 
never to know she as a strumpet more 
and I must save my oath if fury fail not 
her husband die tonight or at the most 
live not to see the morning spend tomorrow 
then will I make she lawful my own 
without this sin and horror now I be chide 
for what I shall enjoy then unforbidden 
and I will not freeze in stove it be but a while 
live like a hopeful bridegroom chaste from flesh 
and pleasure then will seem new fair and fresh 

the morning so far waste yet his baseness 
so impudent see if the very sun do not blush at he 
dare he do thus much and know i alive 
put case one must be vicious as I know myself 
monstrous guilty there be a blind time make for it

I bear to her advancement in this match 
with lord Vincentio as the duke have wrought it 
to the perpetual honour of our house 
put fire into my blood to purge the air 
of this corruption fear it spread too far 
and poison the whole hope of this fair fortune 
I love her good so dear that no brother 
shall venture far for a sister glory 
than I for her preferment

and you shall play the nymph 
that offer sacrifice to appease her wrath 

sacrifice good sir 

must I be appease then 

that be as you list yourself as you see cause 

methinks it will show the more state in her deity 
to be incense 

it will but my sacrifice 
shall take a course to appease you or I will fail in it 
and teach a sinful bawd to play a goddess 

for our part we will not be ambitious sir 
please you walk in and see the project draw 
then take your choice 

I weigh not so I have one 

how much ado have I to restrain fury 
from break into curse o how painful it be 
to keep great sorrow smother sure I think 
it be hard to dissemble grief than love 
Leantio here the weight of thy loss lie 
which nothing but destruction can suffice 

cease cease religious honour do to sin 
disparage virtue reverence and will pull 
heaven thunder upon Florence holy ceremony 
be make for sacred use not for sinful 
be these the fruit of your repentance brother 
better it have be you have never sorrow 
then to abuse the benefit and return 
to worse than where sin leave you 
vow you then never to keep strumpet more 
and be you now so swift in your desire 
to knit your honour and your life fast to she 
be not sin sure enough to wretched man 
but he must bind himself in chain to it worse 
must marriage that immaculate robe of honour 
that render virtue glorious fair and fruitful 
to her great master be now make the garment 
of leprosy and foulness be this penitence 
to sanctify hot lust what be it otherways 
than worship do to devil be this the best 
amends that sin can make after her riot 
as if a drunkard to appease heaven wrath 
shall offer up his surfeit for a sacrifice 
if that be comely then lust offering be 
on wedlock sacred altar 

here you be bitter 
without cause brother what I vow I keep 
as safe as you your conscience and this need not 
I taste more wrath in it than I do religion 
and envy more than goodness the path now 
I tread be honest lead to lawful love 
which virtue in her strictness will not check 
I vow no more to keep a sensual woman 
it be do I mean to make a lawful wife of she 

he that teach you that craft 
call he not master long he will undo you 
Grow not too cunning for your soul good brother 
be it enough to use adulterous theft 
and then take sanctuary in marriage 
I grant so long as a offender keep 
close in a privilege temple his life be safe 
but if he ever venture to come out 
and so be take than he sure die for it 
so now you be safe but when you leave this body 
man only privilege temple upon earth 
in which the guilty soul take sanctuary 
than you will perceive what wrong chaste vow endure 
when lust usurp the bed that shall be pure

in silence and I find great knowledge in you 
and severe learning yet amongst all your virtue 
I see not charity write which some call 
the firstborn of religion and I wonder 
I can see it in you believe it sir 
there be no virtue can be soon miss 
or late welcome it begin the rest 
and set they all in order heaven and angel 
take great delight in a convert sinner 
why shall you then a servant and professor 
differ so much from they if every woman 
that commit evil shall be therefore keep 
back in desire of goodness how shall virtue 
be know and honour from a man that be blind 
to take a burn taper it be no wrong 
he never miss it but to take light 
from one that see we that be injury and spite 
pray whether be religion better serve 
when live that be licentious be make honest 
then when they still run through a sinful blood 
it be nothing virtue temple to deface 
but build the ruin there be a work of grace 

I kiss thou for that spirit thou have praise thy wit 
a modest way on on there 

lust be bold 
and will have vengeance speak ere it be control 

speak have thou any sense of thy abuse 
do thou know what wrong be do thou
