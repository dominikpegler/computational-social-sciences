
take every man his flagon give the oath 
to all you meet I be this day the state drunkard 
I be sure against my will and if you find 
a man at ten that be sober he be a traitor 
and in my name arrest he 

very good sir 
but say he be a sexton 

if the bell 
ring out of tune as if the street be burn 
and he cry it be rare music bid he sleep 
it be a sign he have take his liquor and if you meet 
a officer preach of sobriety 
unless he read it in Geneva print 
lay he by the heel 

but think you it be a fault 
to be find sober 

it be capital treason 
or if you mitigate it let such pay 
forty crown to the poor but give a pension 
to all the magistrate you find sing catch 
or their wife dance for the courtier reel 
and the duke himself I dare not say distemper 
but kind and in his totter chair carouse 
they do the country service if you meet 
one that eat bread a child of ignorance 
and breed up in the darkness of no drink 
in the true posture though he die in the take 
his drench it skill not what be a private man 
for the public honour we have nought else to think on 
and so dear friend copartner in my travail 
drink hard and let the health run through the city 
until it reel again and with i cry 
long live the duchess 

here be two lord what think you 
shall we give the oath to they 

fie no I know they 
you need not swear they your lord by his patent 
stand bind to take his rouse long line the duchess 

the cause of this but yesterday the court 
wear the sad livery of distrust and fear 
no smile not in a buffoon to be see 
or common jester the great duke himself 
have sorrow in his face which wait on 
by his mother sister and his fair duchess 
disperse a silent mourning through all Milan 
as if some great blow have be give the state 
or be at least expect 

Stephano 
I know as you be noble you be honest 
and capable of secret of more weight 
then now I shall deliver if that Sforza 
the present duke though his whole life have be 
but one continue pilgrimage through danger 
affright and horror which his fortune guide 
by his strong judgement still have overcome 
appear now shake it deserve no wonder 
all that his youth have labour for the harvest 
sow by his industry ready to be reap to 
be now at the stake and all his hope confirm 
or lose for ever 

I know no such hazard 
the people well affect and so wise 
his provident care have wrought that though war rage 
in most part of our western world there be 
no enemy near we 

danger that we see 
to threaten ruin be with ease prevent 
but those strike deadly that come unexpected 
the lightning be far off yet soon as see 
we may behold the terrible effect 
that it produce but I will help your knowledge 
and make his cause of fear familiar to you 
the war so long continue between 
the emperor Charles and Francis the french king 
have interest in either cause the most 
of the italian prince among which Sforza 
as one of great power be seek by both 
but with assurance have one his friend 
the other live his enemy 

it be true 
and it be a doubtful choice 

but he well know 
and have too it seem the spanish pride 
lend his assistance to the king of France 
which have so far incense the emperor 
that all his hope and honour be embark 
with his great patron fortune 

which stand fair 
for aught I yet can hear 

but shall it change 
the duke be undo they have draw to the field 
two royal army full of fiery youth 
of equal spirit to dare and power to do 
so near entrench that it be beyond all hope 
of human council they can ever be severe 
until it be determine by the sword 
who have the better cause for the success 
conclude the victor innocent and the vanquish 
most miserable guilty how uncertain 
the fortune of the war be child know 
and it be in suspense on who fair tent 
wing victory will make her glorious stand 
you can blame the duke though he appear 
perplex and trouble 

but why then 
in such a time when every knee shall bend 
for the success and safety of his person 
be these loud triumph in my weak opinion 
they be unseasonable 

I judge so too 
but only in the cause to be excuse 
it be the duchess birthday once a year 
solemnize with all pomp and ceremony 
in which the duke be not his own but she 
nay every day indeed he be her creature 
for never man so dote but to tell 
the ten part of his fondness to a stranger 
will argue i of fiction 

she be indeed 
a lady of most exquisite form 

she know it 
and how to prize it 

I never hear she taint 
in any point of honour 

on my life 
she be constant to his bed and well deserve 
his large favour but when beauty be 
stamp on great woman great in birth and fortune 
and blow by flatterer great than it be 
it be seldom unaccompanied with pride 
nor be she thatway free presume on 
the duke affection and her own desert 
she bear herself with such a majesty 
look with scorn on all as thing beneath she 
that Sforza mother that will lose no part 
of what be once her own nor his fair sister 
a lady too acquaint with her worth 
will brook it well and howsoever their hate 
be smother for a time it be more than fear 
it will at length break out 

he in who power it be 
turn all to the best 

Come let we to the court 
we there shall see all bravery and cost 
that art can boast of 

I will bear you company 

I will not go I scorn to be a spot 
in her proud train 

shall I that be his mother 
be so indulgent as to wait on she 
that owe i duty 

it be do to the duke 
and not to she and my sweet wife remember 
and madam if you please receive my council 
as Sforza be your son you may command he 
and as a sister you may challenge from he 
a brother love and favour but this grant 
consider he be the prince and you his subject 
and not to question or contend with she 
who he be please to honour private man 
prefer their wife and shall he be a prince 
and bless with one that be the paradise 
of sweetness and of beauty to who charge 
the stock of woman goodness be give up 
not use she like herself 

you be ever forward 
to sing her praise 

other be as fair 
I be sure as noble 

I detract from none 
in give she what be due be she deform 
yet be the duchess I stand bind to serve she 
but as she be to admire she never wife 
meet with a pure heat her husband fervour 
a happy pair one in the other bless 
she confident in herself he be whole she 
and can seek for change and he secure 
that it be not in the power of man to tempt she 
and therefore to contest with she that be 
the strong and the better part of he 
be more than folly you know he of a nature 
not to be play with and shall you forget 
to obey he as your prince he will not remember 
the duty that he owe you 

it be but truth 
come clear our brow and let we to the banquet 
but not to serve his idol 

I shall do 
what may become the sister of a prince 
but will not stoop beneath it 

yet be wise 
soar not too high to fall but stoop to rise 


quick quick for love sake let the court put 
her choice outside cost and bravery on 
be only think of 

all that may be have 
to please the eye the ear taste touch or smell 
be careful provide 

there be a masque 
have you hear what be the invention 

no matter 
it be intend for the duchess honour 
and if it give her glorious attribute 
as the most fair most virtuous and the rest 
it will please the duke they come 

all be in order 


you be the mistress of the feast sit here 
oh my soul comfort and when Sforza bow 
thus low to do you honour let none think 
the mean service they can pay my love 
but as a fair addition to those title 
they stand possess of let i glory in 
my happiness and mighty king look pale 
with envy while I triumph in my own 
o mother look on she sister admire she 
and since this present age yield not a woman 
worthy to be her second borrow of 
time pass and let imagination help 
of those canonize lady Sparta boast of 
and in her greatness Rome be proud to owe 
to fashion and yet still you must confess 
the phoenix of perfection never be see 
but in my fair Marcelia 

she be indeed 
the wonder of all time 

your excellence 
though I confess you give she but her own 
enforce her modesty to the defence 
of a sweet blush 

it need not my Marcelia 
when most I strive to praise thou I appear 
a poor detractor for thou be indeed 
so absolute in body and in mind 
that but to speak the least part to the height 
will ask a angel tongue and yet then end 
in silent admiration 

you still court she 
as if she be a mistress not your wife 

a mistress mother she be more to i 
and every day deserve more to be ●●●de too 
such as be cloy with those they have embrace 
may think their woo do no night to i 
but be a bridal one where Hymen light 
his torch fresh and new and those delight 
which be not to be clothe in airy sound 
enjoy beget desire as full of heat 
and jovial fervour as when first I taste 
her virgin fruit bless night and be it number 
among those happy one in which a blessing 
be by the full consent of all the star 
confer upon mankind 

my worthy lord 
the only object I behold with pleasure 
my pride my glory in a word my all 
bear witness heaven that I esteem myself 
in nothing worthy of the mean praise 
you can bestow unless it be in this 
that in my heart I love and honour you 
and but that it will smell of arrogance 
to speak my strong desire and zeal to serve you 
I then can say these eye yet never see 
the rise sun but that my vow and prayer 
be send to heaven for the prosperity 
and safety of my lord nor have I ever 
have other study but how to appear 
worthy your favour and that my embrace 
may yield a fruitful harvest of content 
for all your noble travail in the purchase 
of she that be still your servant by these lip 
which pardon i that I presume to kiss 

o swear for ever swear 

I never will seek 
delight but in your pleasure and desire 
when you be seat with all earthly glory 
and age and honour make you fit for heaven 
that one grave may receive we 

it be believe 
believe my bless one 

how she wind herself 
into his soul 

sit all let other feed 
on those gross cate while Sforza banquet with 
immortal viand take in at his eye 
I can live ever thus command the eunuch 
to sing the ditty that I last compose 
in praise of my Marcelia from whence 

from Pavia my dread lord 

speak be all lose 

the letter will inform you 

how his hand shake 
as he receive it 

this be some allay 
to his hot passion 

though it bring death I will read it 

my lord 

to doubt 
be worse than to have lose and to despair 
be but to antedate those misery 
that must fall on we all my hope depend 
upon this battle fortune in my soul 
methinks there shall be that imperious power 
by supernatural not usual mean 
to inform i what I be the cause consider 
why shall I fear the french be bold and strong 
their number full and in their counsel wise 
but then the haughty Spaniard be all fire 
hot in his execution fortunate 
in his attempt marry to victory 
ay there it be that shake i 

excellent lady

one gale of your sweet breath will easy 
disperse these cloud and but yourself there be none 
that dare speak to he 

I will run the hazard

to guard your excellency from certain danger

as a sad harbinger to tell i that 
this pamper lump of flesh must feast the worm

my lord 

sick to the death Marcelia remove 
these sign of mirth they be ominous and but usher 
sorrow and ruin 

bless we heaven 

my son 

what sudden change be this 

all leave the room 
I will bear alone the burden of my grief 
and must admit no partner I be yet 
your prince where be your obedience stay Marcelia 
I can be so greedy of a sorrow 
in which you must not share 

and cheerful 
I will sustain my part why look you pale 
where be that wont constancy and courage 
that dare the worst of fortune where be Sforza 
to who all danger that fright common man 
appear but panic terror why do you eye i 
with such fix look love counsel duty service 
may flow from i not danger 

o Marcelia 
it be for thou I fear for thou thy Sforza 
shake like a coward for myself unmoved 
I can have hear my troop be cut in piece 
my general slay and he on who my hope 
of rule of state of life have their dependence 
the king of France my great friend make prisoner 
to so proud enemy 

then you have just cause 
to show you be a man 

all this be nothing 
though I add to it that I be assure 
for give aid to this unfortunate king 
the emperor incense lay his command 
on his victorious army flesh with spoil 
and bold of conquest to march up against i 
and seize on my estate suppose that do too 
the city take the kennel run blood 
the ransack temple fall on their saint 
my mother in my sight toss on their pike 
and sister ravish and myself bind fast 
in chain to grace their triumph or what else 
a enemy insolence can load i with 
I will be Sforza still but when I think 
that my Marcelia to who all these 
be but as atom to the great hill 
must suffer in my cause and for i suffer 
all earthly torment nay even those the damn 
howl for in hell be gentle stroke compare 
to what I feel Marcelia 

good sir have patience 
I can as well partake your adverse fortune 
as I thus long have have a ample share 
in your prosperity it be not in the power 
of fate to alter i for while I be 
in spite of it I be you 

but shall that will 
to be so force Marcelia and I live 
to see those eye I prize above my own 
dart favour though compel upon another 
or those sweet lip yield immortal nectar 
be gentle touch by any but myself 
think think Marcelia what a curse thing 
I be beyond expression 

do not feed 
those jealous thought the only blessing that 
heaven have bestow on we more than on beast 
be that it be in our pleasure when to die 
beside be I now in another power 
there be so many way to let out life 
I will not live for one short minute his 
I be bear only you and I will die so 

angel reward the goodness of this woman 
all I can pay be nothing why uncalled for 

it be of weight sir that make i thus press 
upon your privacy your constant friend 
the marquis of Pescara tire with haste 
ha h business that concern your life and fortune 
and with speed to impart 

wait on he hither 
and dear to thy closet let thy prayer 
assist my counsel 

to spare imprecation 
against myself without you I be nothing 

the marquis of Pescara a great soldier 
and though he serve upon the adverse party 
ever my constant friend 


yonder he walk 
full of sad thought 

blame he not good Francisco 
he have much cause to grieve will I may end so 
and not add this to fear 

my dear Pescara 
a miracle in these time a friend and happy 
cleave to a fall fortune 

if it be 
as well in my weak power in act to raise it 
as it be to bear a part of sorrow with you 
you then shall have just cause to say Pescara 
look not upon your state but on your virtue 
when he make suit to be write in the list 
of those you favour but my haste forbid 
all compliment thus then sir to the purpose 
the cause that unattended bring i hither 
be not to tell you of your loss or danger 
for fame have many wing to bring ill tiding 
and I presume you have hear it but to give you such 
such friendly counsel as perhaps may make 
your sad disaster less 

you be all goodness 
and I give up my self to be dispose of 
as in your wisdom you think fit 

thus then sir 
to hope you can hold out against the emperor 
be flattery in yourself to your undo 
therefore the safe course that you can take 
be to give up yourself to his discretion 
before you be compel for rest assure 
a voluntary yield may find grace 
and will admit defence at least excuse 
but shall you linger doubtful till his power 
have seize your person and estate perforce 
you must expect extreme 

I understand you 
and I will put your counsel into act 
and speedy I only will take order 
for some domestical affair that do 
concern i near and with the next sun 
ride with you in the mean time my best friend 
pray take your rest 

Indeed I have travail hard 
and will embrace your counsel 

with all care 
attend my noble friend stay you Francisco 
you see how thing stand with i 

to my grief 
and if the loss of my poor life can be 
a sacrifice to restore they as they be 
I willing will lay it down 

I think so 
for I have ever find you true and thankful 
which make i love the building I have raise 
in your advancement and repent no grace 
I have confer upon you and believe i 
though now I shall repeat my favour to you 
the title I have give you and the mean 
suitable to your honour that I think you 
worthy my sister and my family 
and in my dukedom make you next myself 
it be not to upbraid you but to tell you 
I find you be worthy of they in your love 
and service to i 

sir I be your creature 
and any shape that you will have i wear 
I glad will put on 

thus than Francisco 
I now be to deliver to your trust 
a weighty secret of so strange a nature 
and it will I know appear so monstrous to you 
that you will tremble in the execution 
as much as I be torture to command it 
for it be a deed so horrid that but to hear it 
will strike into a russian flesh in murder 
or a obdurate hangman soft compassion 
and yet Francisco of all man the dear 
and from i most deserve such my state 
and strange condition be that thou alone 
must know the fatal service and perform it 

these preparation sir to work a stranger 
or to one unacquainted with your bounty 
may appear useful but to i they be 
needless impertinence for I dare doc 
whatever you dare command 

but thou must swear it 
and put into thy oath all joy or torment 
that fright the wicked or confirm the good 
not to conceal it only that be nothing 
but whensoever my will shall speak strike now 
to fall upon it like thunder 

Minister 
the oath in any way or form you please 
I stand resolve to take it 

thou must do then 
what no malevolent star will dare to look on 
it be so wicked for which man will curse thou 
for be the instrument and the bless angel 
forsake i at my need for be the author 
for it be a deed of night of night Francisco 
in which the memory of all good action 
we can pretend too shall be bury quick 
or if we be remember it shall be 
to fright posterity by our example 
that have outgo all precedent of villain 
that be before we and such as succeed 
though teach in hell black school shall never come near we 
be thou not shake yet 

I grant you move i 
but to a man confirm 

he try your temper 
what think you of my wife 

as a thing sacred 
to who fair name and memory I pay glad 
these sign of duty 

be the not the abstract 
of all that be rare or to be wish in woman 

it be a kind of blasphemy to dispute it 
but to the purpose sir 

add to her goodness 
her tenderness of i her care to please i 
her unsuspected chastity never equal 
her innocence her honour oh I be lose 
in the ocean of her virtue and her grace 
when I think of they 

now I find the end 
of all your conjuration there be some service 
to be do for this sweet lady if she have enemy 
that she will have remove 

Alas Francisco 
her great enemy be her great lover 
yet in that hatred her idolater 
one smile of she will make a savage tame 
one accent of that tongue will calm the sea 
though all the wind at once strive there for empire 
yet I for who she think all this too little 
shall I miscarry in this present journey 
from whence it be all number to a cypher 
I never return with honour by thy hand 
must have she murder 

murder she that love so 
and so deserve to be belove again 
and I who sometime you be please to favour 
pick out the instrument 

do not fly off 
what be decree can never be recall 
it be more than love to she that mark she out 
a wish companion to i in both fortune 
and strong assurance of thy zealous faith 
that give up to thy trust a secret that 
rack shall not have force from i o Francisco 
there be no heaven without she nor a hell 
where she reside I ask from she but justice 
and what I will have pay to she have sickness 
or any other accident divorce 
her pure soul from his unspotted body 
the slavish indian prince when they die 
be cheerful attend to the fire 
by the wife and slave that live they love best 
to do they service in another world 
nor will I be less honour that love more 
and therefore trifle not but in thy look 
express a ready purpose to perform 
what I command or by Marcelia soul 
this be thy late minute 

it be not fear 
of death but love to you make i embrace it 
but for my own security when it be do 
what warrant have I if you please to sign one 
I shall though with unwillingness and horror 
perform your dreadful charge 

I will Francisco 
but still remember that a prince secret 
be balm conceal but poison if discover 
I may come back then this be but a trial 
to purchase thou if it be possible 
a near place in my affection but 
I know thou honest 

it be a character 
I will not part with 

I may live to reward it 


how leave the court 

without guard or retinue 
fit a prince 

no enemy near to force he 
to leave his own strength yet deliver up 
himself as it be in bond to the discretion 
of he that hate he it be beyond example 
you never hear the motive that induce he 
to this strange course 

no those be cabinet counsel 
and not to be communicate but 
to such as be his own and sure alas 
we fill up empty place and in public 
be teach to give our suffrage to that 
which be before determine and be safe so 
signior Francisco upon who alone 
his absolute power be with all strength confer 
during his absence can with ease resolve you 
to i they be riddle 

well he shall not be 
my Oedipus I will rather dwell in darkness 
but my good lord Tiberio this Francisco 
be on the sudden strange raise 

o sir 
he take the thryve course he have a sister 
a fair one too with who as it be rumour 
the duke be too familiar but she cast off 
what promise soever pass between they 
upon the sight of this forsake the court 
and since be never see to smother this 
as honour never fail to purchase silence 
Francisco first be grace and step by step 
be raise up to this height 

but how be his absence bear 

sad it seem 
by the duchess for since he leave the court 
for the most part she have keep her private chamber 
no visitant admit in the church 
she have be see to pay her pure devotion 
season with tear and sure her sorrow be true 
or deep counterfeit pomp and state 
and bravery cast off and she that late 
rivald Poppaea in her vary shape 
or the egyptian queen now widowlike 
in sable colour as her husband danger 
strangle in she the use of any pleasure 
mourn for his absence 

it become her virtue 
and do confirm what be report of she 

you take it right but on the other side 
the darling of his mother Mariana 
as there be a antipathy between 
she and the duchess passion and as 
she have no dependence on her brother fortune 
she never appear so full of mirth 

it be strange 
but see her favourite and accompany 
to your report 

you shall scrape and I will sing 
a scurvy ditty to a scurvy tune 
repine who dare 

but if we shall offend 
the duchess have silence we and these lord 
stand by to hear we 

they in name be lord 
but I be one in power and for the duchess 
but yesterday we be merry for her pleasure 
we now will be for my lady 

signior Graccho

but you great lord and councillor of state 
who I stand bind to reverence 

Come we know 
you be a man in grace 

fie no I grant 
I bear my fortune patient serve the princess 
and have success at all time to her closet

to muster up this music on my honesty 
you shall much befriend i 

sirrah you grow saucy 

and will be lay by the heel 

not by your lordship 
without a special warrant look to your own stake 
be I commit here come those will bail i 
perhaps we may change place too 

the princess 
we must be patient 

there be no contend 

see the inform rogue 

that we shall stoop 
to such a mushroom 

thou do mistake they dare not 
use the least word of scorn although provoke 
to any thing of i go get you home 
and  servant friend and flatterer number 
how many descent you be noble look to your wife too 
the smoothchinned courtier be abroad

these arras picture of nobility 
I ever read of 

I can speak sometime 

and cover so your bitter pill with sweetness 
of princely language to forbid reply 
they be greedy swallow 

but the purpose daughter 
that bring we hither be it to bestow 
a visit on this woman that because 
she only will be think true to grieve 
the absence and the danger of my son 
proclaim a general sadness 

if to vex she 
may be interpret to do her honour 
she shall have many of they I will make use 
of my short reign my lord now govern all 
and she shall know that her idolater 
my brother be not by now to protect she 
I be her equal 

of a little thing

and for you upstart 

there be no contend 

what shall become of these 

see they well whip 
as you will answer it 

now signior Graccho

let they first know themselves and how you be 
to be serve and honour which when they confess 
you may again receive they to your favour 
and then it will show noble 

with my thanks 
the duke shall pay you his if he return 
to bless we with his presence 

there be nothing 
that can be add to your fair acceptance 
that be the prize indeed all else be blank 
and of no value as in virtuous action 
the undertaker find a full reward 
although confer upon unthankful man 
so any service do to so much sweetness 
however dangerous and subject to 
a ill construction in your favour find 
a wish and glorious end 

from you I take this 
as loyal duty but in any other 
it will appear gross flattery 

flattery madam 
you be so rare and excellent in all thing 
and raise so high upon a rock of goodness 
as that vice can reach you who but look on 
this temple build by nature to perfection 
but must bow to it and out of that zeal 
not only learn to adore it but to love it 

whither will this fellow 

pardon therefore madam 
if a excess in i of humble duty 
teach i to hope and though it be not in 
the power of man to merit such a blessing 
my piety for it be more than love 
may find reward 

you have it in my thanks 
and on my hand I be please that you shall take 
a full possession of it but take heed 
that you fix here and feed no hope beyond it 
if you do it will prove fatal 

be it death 
and death with torment tyrant never find out 
yet I must say I love you 

as a subject 
and it will become you 

farewell circumstance 
and since you be not please to understand i 
but by a plain and usual form of speech 
all superstitious reverence lay by 
I love you as a man and as a man 
I will enjoy you why do you start and fly i 
I be no monster and you but a woman 
a woman make to yield and by example 
tell it be lawful favour of this nature 
be in our age no miracle in the great 
and therefore lady 

keep of o you power 
libidinous beast and add to that unthankful 
a crime which creature want reason fly from 
be all the princely bounty favour honour 
which with some prejudice to his own wisdom 
thy lord and Rayser have confer upon thou 
in three day absence bury have he make thou 
a thing obscure almost without a name 
the envy of great fortune have I grace thou 
beyond thy rank And entertain thou as 
a friend and not a servant and be this 
this impudent attempt to taint my honour 
the fair return of both our venture favour 

hear my excuse 

the devil may plead mercy 
and with as much assurance as thou yield one 
burn lust so hot in thou or be thy pride 
grow up to such a height that but a princess 
no woman can content thou And add to that 
his wife and princess to who thou be tie 
in all the bond of duty read my life 
and find one act of i so loose carry 
that can invite a most selflovingfool 
set of with all that fortune can throw on he 
to the least hope to find way to my favour 
and what be the worst i enemy can wish i 
I will be thy strumpet 

it be acknowledge madam 
that your whole course of life have be a pattern 
for chaste and virtuous woman in your beauty 
which I first see and love as a fair crystal 
I read your heavenly mind clear and untainted 
and while the duke do prize you to your value 
can it have be in man to pay that duty 
I well may envy he but dare not hope 
to stop you in your full career of goodness 
but now I find that he be fall from his fortune 
and howsoever he will appear dote 
grow cold in his affection I presume 
from his most barbarous neglect of you 
to offer my true service nor stand I bind 
to look back on the courtesy of he 
that of all live man be most unthankful 

unheardof impudence 

you will say I be modest 
when I have tell the story can he tax i 
that have receive some worldly trifle from he 
for be ingrateful when he that first taste 
and have so long enjoy your sweet embrace 
in which all blessing that our frail condition 
be capable of be whole comprehend 
as cloy with happiness contemn the giver 
of his felicity And as he reach not 
the masterpiece of mischief which he aim at 
unless he pay those favour he stand bind to 
with fell and deadly hate you think he love you 
with unexampled fervour nay dote on you 
as there be something in you more than woman 
when on my knowledge he long since have wish 
you be among the dead and I you scorn so 
perhaps be your preserver 

bless i good angel 
or I be blast lie so false and wicked 
and fashion to so damnable a purpose 
can be speak by a humane tongue 
my husband hate i give thyself the lie 
false and accurse thy soul if thou have any 
can witness never lady stand so bind 
to the unfeigned affection of her lord 
as I do to my Sforza if thou will work 
upon my weak credulity tell i rather 
that the earth move the sun and star stand still 
the ocean keep nor flood nor ebb or that 
there be peace between the lion and the lamb 
or that the ravenous eagle and the dove 
keep in one eyrie and bring up their young 
or any thing that be averse to nature 
and I will soon credit it than that 
my lord can think of i but as a jewel 
he love more than himself and all the world 

o innocence abuse simplicity cozen 
it be a sin for which we have no name 
to keep you long in this wilful error 
read his affection here and then observe 
how dear he hold you it be his character 
which cunning yet can never counterfeit 

it be his hand I be resolve of it 
I will try what the inscription be 

pray you do so 

you know my pleasure and the hour of Marcelia death which fail not to execute as you will answer the contrary not with your head alone but with the ruin of your whole family and this write with my own hand and sign with my privy signet shall be your sufficient warrant Ludovico Sforza 
I do obey it every word be a poniard 
and reach to my heart 
she swoon 

what have I do 
madam for heaven sake madam o my fate 
I will bend her body this be yet some pleasure 
I will kiss she into a new life dear lady 
she stir for the duke sake for Sforza sake 

Sforza stand off though dead I will be he 
and even my ash shall abhor the touch 
of any other o unkind and cruel 
learn woman learn to trust in one another 
there be no faith in man Sforza be false 
false to Marcelia 

but I be true 
and live to make you happy all the pomp 
state and observance you have be he 
compare to what you shall enjoy when i 
shall be no more remember loose his memory 
and look with cheerful beam on your new creature 
and know what he have plot for you good 
fate can alter if the emperor 
take not his life at his return he die 
and by my hand my wife that be his heir 
shall quick follow then we reign alone 
for with this arm I will swim through sea of blood 
or make a bridge arch with the bone of man 
but I will grasp my aim in you my dear 
dear and best of woman 

thou be a villain 
all attribute of archvillain make into one 
can express thou I prefer the hate 
of Sforza though it mark i for the grave 
before thy base affection I be yet 
pure and unspotted in my true love to he 
nor shall it be corrupt though he be taint 
nor will I part with innocence because 
he be find guilty for thyself thou be 
a thing that equal with the devil himself 
I do detest and scorn 

thou then be nothing 
thy life be in my power disdainful woman 
think on it and tremble 

no though thou be now 
to play thy hangman part thou well may be 
my executioner and art only fit 
for such employment but never hope to have 
the least grace from i I will never see thou 
but as the shame of man so with my curse 
of horror to thy conscience in this life 
and pain in hell hereafter I spit at thou 
and make haste to make my peace with heaven 
expect thou as my hangman 

I be lose 
in the discovery of this fatal secret 
curse hope that flatter i that wrong can make she 
a stranger to her goodness all my plot 
turn back upon my self but I be in 
and must go on and since I have put off 
from the shore of innocence guilt be now my pilot 
revenge first wrought i murder be his twinbrother 
one deadly sin then help to cure another 


the spoil the spoil it be that the soldior fight for 
our victory as yet afford we nothing 
but wound and empty honour we have pass 
the hazard of a dreadful day and force 
a passage with our sword through all the danger 
that page like wait on the success of war 
and now expect reward 

hell put it in 
the enemy mind to be desperate and hold out 
yield and composition will undo we 
and what be that way give for the most part 
come to the emperor coffer to defray 
the charge of the great action as it be rumour 
when usual some thing in grace that never hear 
the canon roar tongue but at a triumph 
put in and for his intercession share 
all that we fight for the poor soldier leave 
to starve or fill up hospital 

but when 
we enter town by force and carve ourselves 
pleasure with pillage and the rich wine 
open our shrunkup vein and pour into they 
new blood and fervour 

I long to be at it 
to see these chuff that every day may spend 
a soldier entertainment for a year 
yet make a three meal of a bunch of raisin 
these sponge that suck up a kingdom sit 
batten like scarab in the nung of peace 
to be squeeze out by the rough hand of war 
and all that their whole life have heap together 
by cozenage perjury or sordid thrift 
with one gripe to be ravishd 

I will be touse 
their fair madonna be that in little dog 
monkey and parakeet consume thousand 
yet for the advancement of a noble action 
repine to part with a poor piece of eight 
war plague upon they I have see they stop 
their scornful nose first then seem to swoon 
at sight of a buff jerkin if it be not 
perfume and hide with gold yet these nice wanton 
spur on by lust cover in some disguise 
to meet some rough court stallion and be leap 
dare enter into any common brothel 
though all variety of stink contend there 
yet praise the entertainment 

I may live 
to see the tatter rascal of my troop 
drag they out of their closet with a vengeance 
when neither threaten flatter kneel howl 
can ransom one poor jewel or redeem 
themselves from their blunt woo 

my main hope be 
to begin the sport at Milan there be enough 
and of all kind of pleasure we can wish for 
to satisfy the most covetous 

every day 
we look for a remove 

for Lodowick Sforza 
the duke of Milan ay on my own knowledge 
can say thus much he be too much a soldier 
too confident of his own worth too rich to 
and understand too well the emperor hate he 
to hope for composition 

on my life 
we need not fear his come in 

on i 
I do not wish it I have rather that 
to show his valour he will put we to the trouble 
to fetch he in by the ear 

the emperor 


you make i wonder nay it be no council you may partake it gentleman who will have think 
that he that scorn our proffer amity 
when he be sue to shall ere he be summon 
whither persuade to it by base fear 
or flatter by false hope which it be uncertain 
first kneel for mercy 

when your majesty 
shall please to instruct we who it be we may 
admire it with you 

who but the duke of Milan 
the right hand of the french of all that stand 
in our displeasure who necessity 
compel to seek our favour I will have swear 
Sforza have be the last 

and shall be write so 
in the list of those you pardon will his city 
have rather hold we out a siege like Troy 
then by a feign submission he shall cheat you 
of a just revenge or we of those fair glory 
we have sweat blood to purchase 

with your honour 
you can hear he 

the sack alone of Milan 
will pay the army 

I be not so weak 
to be wrought on as you fear nor ignorant 
that money be the sinew of the war 
and what term soever he seek peace 
it be in our power to grant it or deny it 
yet for our glory and to show he that 
we have bring he on his knee it be resolve 
to hear he as a suppliant bring he in 
but let he see the effect of our just anger 
in the guard that you make for he 

I be now 
familiar with the issue all plague on it 
he will appear in some deject habit 
his countenance suitable and for his order 
a rope about his neck then kneel and tell 
old story what a worthy thing it be 
to have power and not to use it then add to that 
a tale of king Tigranes and great Pompey 
who say forsooth and wise it be more honour 
to make a king then kill one which apply 
to the emperor and himself a pardon be grant 
to he a enemy and we his servant 
condemn to beggary 

yonder he come 
but not as you expect 

he look as if 
he will outface his danger 

I be cozen 
a suitor in the devil name 

hear he speak 

I come not emperor to invade thy mercy 
by fawn on thy fortune nor bring with i 
excuse or denial I profess 
and with a good man confidence even this instant 
that I be in thy power I be thy enemy 
thy deadly and vow enemy one that wish 
confusion to thy person and estate 
and with my utmost power and deep counsel 
have they be true follow further it 
nor will I now although my neck be under 
the hangman axe with one poor syllable 
confess but that I honour the french king 
more than thyself and all man 

by saint jaques 
this be no flattery 

there be fire and spirit in it 
but not long live I hope 

now give i leave 
my hate against thyself and love to he 
free acknowledge to give up the reason 
that make i so affect in my want 
I ever find he faithful have supply 
of man and money from he and my hope 
quite sink be by his grace buoy up again 
he be indeed to i as my good angel 
to guard i from all danger I dare speak 
nay must and will his praise now in as high 
and loud a key as when he be thy equal 
the benefit he sow in i meet not 
unthankful ground but yield he his own 
with fair increase and I still glory in it 
and though my fortune poor compare to his 
and Milan weigh with France appear as nothing 
be in thy fury burn let it be mention 
they serve but as small taper to attend 
the solemn flame at this great funeral 
and with they I will glad waste myself 
rather than undergo the imputation 
of be base or unthankful 

noble speak 

I do begin I know not why to hate he 
less than I do 

if that then to be grateful 
for courtesy receive or not to leave 
a friend in his necessity be a crime 
among you Spaniard which other nation 
that like your aim at empire love and cherish 
wherever they find it Sforza bring his head 
to pay the forfeit nor come I as a slave 
pinion and fetter in a squalid weed 
fall before thy foot kneel and howl 
for a forestal remission that be poor 
and will but shame thy victory for conquest 
over base foe be a captivity 
and not a triumph I never fear to die 
more than I wish to live when I have reach 
my end in be a duke I wear these robe 
this crown upon my head and to my side 
this sword be gird and witness truth that now 
it be in another power when I shall part 
with they and life together I be the same 
my vein then do not swell with pride nor now 
they shrink for fear know sir that Sforza stand 
prepare for either fortune 

as I live 
I do begin strange to love this fellow 
and can part with three quarter of my share 
in the promise spoil to save he 

but if example 
of my fidelity to the french who honour 
title and glory be now mix with you 
as brook devour by river lose their name 
have power to invite you to make he a friend 
that have give evident proof he know to love 
and to be thankful this my crown now you 
you may restore i and in i instruct 
these brave commander shall your fortune change 
which now I wish not what they may expect 
from noble enemy for be faithful 
the charge of the war I will defray 
and what you may not without hazard force 
bring free to you I will prevent the cry 
of murder infant and of ravish maid 
which in a city sack call on heaven justice 
and stop the course of glorious victory 
and when I know the captain and the soldier 
that have in the late battle do best service 
and be to be reward ay myself 
accord to their quality and merit 
will see they large recompense I have say 
and now expect my sentence 

by this light 
it be a brave gentleman 

how like a block 
the emperor sit 

he have deliver reason 
especial in his purpose to enrich 
such as fight brave i myself be one 
I care not who know it as I wonder that 
he can be so stupid now he begin to stir 
mercy an it be thy will 

thou have so far 
outgo my expectation noble Sforza 
for such I hold thou and true constancy 
raise on a brave foundation bear such palm 
and privilege with it that where we behold it 
though in a enemy it do command we 
to love and honour it by my future hope 
I be glad for thy sake that in seek favour 
thou do not borrow of vice her indirect 
crooked and abject mean and for my own 
that since my purpose must now be change 
touch thy life and fortune the world can 
tax i of levity in my settle counsel 
I be neither wrought by tempt bribe 
nor servile flattery but force unto it 
by a fair war of virtue 

This sound well 

all former passage of hate be bury 
for thus with open arm I meet thy love 
and as a friend embrace it and so far 
I be from rob thou of the least honour 
that with my hand to make it sit the fast 
I set thy crown once more upon thy head 
and do not only style thou duke of Milan 
but vow to keep thou so yet not to take 
from other to give only to myself 
I will not hinder your magnificence 
to my commander neither will I urge it 
but in that as in all thing else I leave you 
to be your own disposer 

may I live 
to seal my loyalty though with loss of life 
in some brave service worthy Caesar favor 
and I shall die most happy gentleman 
receive i to your love and if henceforth 
there can arise a difference between we 
it shall be in a noble emulation 
who have the fair sword or dare go far 
to sight for Charles the emperor

and there we be your scholar

as far outstrip the master we will contend 
in love hereafter in the mean time pray you

yonder the proud slave be how he look now 
after his castigation 

as he come 
from a close sight at sea under the hatch 
with a she dunkirk that be shoot before 
between wind and weather 
and he have spring a leak too or I be cozen 

let we be merry with he 

how they stare at i be I turn to a owl 
the wonder gentleman 

I read this morning 
strange story of the passive fortitude 
of man in former age which I think 
impossible and not to be believe 
but now I look on you my wonder cease 

the reason sir 

why sir you have be whip 
whip signior Graccho and the whip I take it 
be to a gentleman the great trial 
that may be of his patience 

sir I will call you 
to a strict account for this 

I will not deal with you 
unless I have a beadle for my second 
and then I will answer you 

farewell poor Graccho 

better and better still if ever wrong 
can teach a wretch to find the way to vengeance 
hell now inspire i how the lord protector 
my judge I thank he whether thus in private 
I will not see he 

if I be seek for 
say I be indispose and will not hear 
or suit or suitor 

but sir if the prince 
inquire what shall I answer 

say I be rid 
abroad to take the air but by no mean 
let she know I be in court 

so I shall tell she 

within there lady 

my good lord your pleasure 

prithee let i beg thy favour for access 
to the duchess 

in good sooth my lord I dare not 
she be very private 

Come there be gold to buy thou 
a new gown and a rich one 
this will tempt i 

I once swear 
if ever I lose my maidenhead it shall be 
with a great lord as you be and I know not how 
I feel a yield inclination in i 
if you have appetite 

pox on thy maidenhead 
where be thy lady 

if you venture on she 
she be walk in the gallery perhaps 
you will find she less tractable 

bring i to she 

I fear you will have cold entertainment when 
you be at your journey end and it be discretion 
to take a snatch by the way 

prithee leave fool 
my page wait in the lobby give he sweet meat 
he be train up for his master ease 
and he will cool thou 

a brave discovery beyond my hope 
a plot even offer to my hand to work on 
if I be dull now may I live and die 
the scorn of worm and slave let i consider 
my lady and her mother first commit 
in the favour of the duchess and I whip 
that with a iron pen be write in brass 
on my tough heart now grow a hard metal 
and all his bribe approach to the duchess 
to be conceal good good this to my lady 
deliver as I will order it run her mad 
but this may prove but courtship let it be 
I care not so it feed her jealousy 


believe thy tear or oath can it be hope 
after a practice so abhor and horrid 
repentance ever can find thou 

dear lady 
great in your fortune great in your goodness 
make a superlative of excellence 
in be great in your save mercy 
I do confess humble confess my fault 
to be beyond all pity my attempt 
so barbarous rude that it will turn 
a saintlike patience into savage fury 
but you that be all innocence and virtue 
no spleen or anger in you of a woman 
but when a holy zeal to piety fire you 
may if you please impute the fault to love 
or call it beastly lust for it be no better 
a sin a monstrous sin yet with it many 
that do prove good man after have be tempt 
and though I be crooked now it be in your power 
to make i straight again 

be it possible 
this can be cunning 

but if no submission 
nor prayer can appease you that you may know 
it be not the fear of death that make i sue thus 
but a loathe detestation of my madness 
which make i wish to live to have your pardon 
I will not wait the sentence of the duke 
since his return be doubtful but I myself 
will do a fearful justice on myself 
no witness by but you there be no more 
when I offend yet before I do it 
for I perceive in you no sign of mercy 
I will disclose a secret which die with i 
may prove your ruin 

speak it it will take from 
the burden of thy conscience 

thus then madam 
the warrant by my lord sign for your death 
be but conditional but you must swear 
by your unspotted truth not to reveal it 
or I end here abrupt 

by my hope 
of joy hereafter on 

nor be it hate 
that force he to it but excess of love 
and if I ever return so say great Sforza 
no live man deserve to enjoy 
my best Marcelia with the first news 
that I be dead for no man after i 
may ever enjoy she but till certain proof 
assure thou I be lose these be his word 
fail not to kill she 
observe and honour she as if the seal 
of woman goodness only dwell in she 
this trust I have abuse and base wrong 
and if the excel pity of your mind 
can forgive it as I dare not hope it 
rather than look on my offend lord 
I stand resolve to punish it 

hold it be forgive 
and by i free pardon in thy fair life 
hereafter study to deserve this bounty 
with thy true penitence such I believe it 
against my resolution have force from i 
but that my lord my Sforza shall esteem 
my life fit only as a page to wait on 
the various course of his uncertain fortune 
or cherish in himself that sensual hope 
in death to know i as a wife afflict i 
nor do his envy less deserve my anger 
which though such be my love I will not nourish 
will stick the ardour that I have to see he 
return in safety 

but if your entertainment 
shall give the least ground to his jealousy 
to raise up a opinion I be false 
you then destroy your mercy therefore madam 
though I shall ever look on you as on 
my life preserver and the miracle 
of human pity will you but vouchsafe 
in company to do i those fair grace 
and favor which your innocence and honour 
may safe warrant it will to the duke 
I be to your best self alone know guilty 
make i appear most innocent 

have your wish 
and some thing I may do to try his temper 
at least to make he know a constant wife 
be not so slave to her husband dote humour 
but that she may deserve to live a widow 
her fate appoint it 

it be enough 
shout and flourish 
nay all I can desire and will make way 
to my revenge which shall disperse itself 
on he on she and all 

what shout be that 

all happiness to the duchess that may flow 
from the duke new and wish return 

he be welcome 

how cold she receive it 

observe their encounter 
flourish 


what you have tell i Graccho be believe 
and I will find time to stir in it 

as you see cause 
I will not do ill office 

I have stand 
silent thus long Marcelia expect 
when with more than a greedy have thou will 
have fly into my arm and on my lip 
have print a deep welcome my desire 
to glaze myself in these fair eye have bear i 
with more than human speed nor dare I stay 
in any temple or to any saint 
to pay my vow and thanks for my return 
till I have see thou 

sir I be most happy 
to look upon you safe and will express 
my love and duty in a modest fashion 
such as may suit with the behaviour 
of one that know herself a wife and how 
to temper her desire not like a wanton 
fire with hot appetite nor can it wrong i 
to love discreet 

how why can there be 
a mean in your affection to Sforza 
or any act though never so loose that may 
invite or heighten appetite appear 
immodest or uncomely do not move i 
my passion to you be in extreme 
and know no bound come kiss i 

I obey you 

by all the joy of love she do salute i 
as if I be her grandfather what witch 
with curse spell have quench the amorous heat 
that live upon these lip tell i Marcelia 
and true tell i be it a fault of i 
that have beget this coldness or neglect 
of other in my absence 

neither sir 
I stand indebt to your substitute 
noble and good Francisco for his care 
and fair observance of i there be nothing 
with which you be present can supply i 
that I dare say I want 

how 

the pleasure 
that sacred Hymen warrant we except 
of which in troth you be too great a doter 
and there be more of beast in it then man 
let we love temperate thing violent last not 
and too much dotage rather argue folly 
then true affection 

observe but this 
and how she praise my lord care and observance 
and then judge madam if my intelligence 
have any ground of truth 

no more I mark it 

how the duke stand 

as he be rout there 
and have no motion 

my lord from whence 
grow this amazement 

it be more dear my friend 
for I be doubtful whether I have a be 
but certain that my life be a burden to i 
take i bake good Pescara show i to Caesar 
in all his rage and fury I disclaim 
his mercy to live now which be his gift 
be worse than death and with all study torment 
Marcelia be unkind nay worse grow cold 
in her affection my excess of fervour 
which it be never equal grow distasteful 
but have thy wish woman thou shall know 
that I can be myself and thus shake off 
the setter of fond dotage from my sight 
without reply for I be apt to do 
something I may repent o who will place 
his happiness in most accurse woman 
in who obsequiousness engender pride 
and harshness deadly from this hour 
I will labour to forget there be such creature 
true friend be now my mistress clear your brow 
and though my heartstring crack for it I will be 
to all a free example of delight 
we will have sport of all kind and propound 
reward to such as can produce we new 
unsatisficed though we surfeit in their store 
and never think of curse Marcelia more 


and be it possible thou shall forget 
a wrong of such a nature and then study 
my safety and content 

sir but allow i 
only to have read the element of courtship 
not the abstruse and hide act to thrive there 
and you may please to grant i so much knowledge 
that injury from one in grace like you 
be noble favour be it not grow common 
in every sect for those that want to suffer 
from such as have to give your captain cast 
if poor though not think dare but approve so 
to raise a coward into name that be rich 
suffer disgrace public but receive 
reward for they in private 

Well observe 
put on we will be familiar and discourse 
a little of this argument that day 
in which it be first rumour then confirm 
great Sforza think i worthy of his favour 
I find myself to be another thing 
not what I be before I pass then 
for a pretty fellow and of pretty part too 
and be perhaps receive so but once raise 
the liberal courtier make i master of 
those virtue which I never know in myself 
if I pretend to a jest it be make one 
by their interpretation if I offer 
to reason of philosophy though absurd 
they have help to save i and without a blush 
will swear that I by nature have more knowledge 
than other can acquire by any labour 
nay all I do indeed which in another 
be not remarkable in i show rare 

but then they taste of your bounty 

true 
they give i those good part I be not bear too 
and by my intercession they get that 
which have I cross they they dare not have hope for 

all this be oracle and shall I then 
for a foolish whip learn to honour he 
that hold the wheel of fortune no that savour 
too much of the ancient freedom since great man 
receive disgrace and give thanks poor knave 
must have not spleen  though I love 
my limb as well as any man If you have now 
a humour to kick i lame into a office 
where I may sit in state and undo other 
stand I not bind to kiss the foot that do it 
though it seem strange there have be such thing see 
in the memory of man 

but to the purpose 
and then that service do make thy own fortune 
my wife thou say be jealous I be too 
familiar with the duchess 

And incense 
for her commitment in her brother absence 
and by her mother anger be spur on 
to make discovery of it this her purpose 
be trust to my charge which I decline 
as much as in i lie but find she 
determinate bend to undertake it 
though break my faith to her may destroy 
my credit with your lordship I yet think 
though at my peril I stand bind to reveal it 

I thank thy care and will deserve this secret 
in make thou acquaint with a great 
and of more moment Come into my bosom 
and take it from i can thou think dull Graccho 
my power and honour be confer upon i 
and add to they this form to have my pleasure 
confine and limit I delight in change 
and sweet variety that be my heaven on earth 
for which I love life only I confess 
my wife please i a day the duchess two 
and yet I must not say I have enjoy she 
but now I care for neither therefore Graccho 
so far I be from stop Mariana 
in make her complaint that I desire thou 
to urge she to it 

that may prove your ruin 
the duke already be as it be report 
doubtful she have play false 

there thou be cozen 
his dotage like a ague keep his course 
and now it be strong on he but I lose time 
and therefore know whether thou will or no 
thou be to be my instrument and in spite 
of the old see that say it be not safe 
on any term to trust a man that be wrong 
I dare thou to be false 

this be a language 
my lord I understand not 

you think sirrah 
to put a trick on i for the relation 
of what I know before and have win 
some weighty secret from i in revenge 
to play the traitor know thou wretched thing 
by my command thou be whip and every day 
I will have thou fresh torture if thou miss 
in the least charge that I impose upon thou 
though what I speak for the most part be true 
nay grant thou have a thousand witness 
to be depose they hear it it be in i 
with one word such be Sforza confidence 
of my fidelity not to be shake 
to make all void and ruin my accuser 
therefore look to it bring my wife hot on 
to accuse i to the duke I have a end in it 
or think what it be make man most miserable 
and that shall fall upon thou thou be a fool 
to hope by be acquaint with my course 
to curb and awe i or that I shall live 
thy slave as thou do saucy divine 
for pry in my counsel still live i 

I be catch on both side this it be for a puny 
in policy protean school to try conclusion 
with one that have commence and go out doctor 
if I discover what but now he brag of 
I shall not be believe if I fall off 
from he his threat and action go together 
and there be no hope of safety till I get 
a plummet that may sound his deep counsel 
I must obey and serve he want of skill 
now make i play the rogue against my will 


command i from his sight and with such scorn 
as he will rate his slave 

it be in his fury 

and he repent it madam 

be I bear 
to observe his humour or because he dote 
must I run mad 

if that your excellence 
will please but to receive a feel knowledge 
of what he suffer and how deep the least 
unkindness wound from you you will excuse 
his hasty language 

he have pay the forfeit 
of his offence I be sure with such a sorrow 
as if it have be great will deserve 
a full remission 

why perhaps he have it 
and I stand more afflict for his absence 
than he can be for i so pray you tell he 
but till I have digest some sad thought 
and reconcile passion that be at war 
within myself I purpose to be private 
and have you care unless it be Francisco 
that no man be admit 

how Francisco 

he that at every stage keep livery mistress 
the stallion of the state 

they be thing above we 
and so no way concern we 

if I be 
the duke I free must confess my weakness 
I shall wear yellow breech here he come 

nay spare your labour lady we know our exit 
and quit the room 

be this her privacy 
though with the hazard of a check perhaps 
this may go to the duke 

your face be full 
of fear and doubt the reason 

o best madam 
they be not counterfeit I your poor convert 
that only wish to live in sad repentance 
to mourn my desperate attempt of you 
that have no end nor aim but that your goodness 
may be a witness of my penitence 
which see will teach you how to love your mercy 
be rob of that last hope the duke the duke 
I more than fear have find that I be guilty 

by my unspotted honour not from i 
nor have I with he change one syllable 
since his return but what you hear 

yet malice 
be eagleeyed and will see that which be not 
and jealousy be too apt to build upon 
unsure foundation 

jealousy 

it take 

who dare but only think I can be taint 
but for he though almost on certain proof 
to give it hear not belief deserve 
my hate for ever 

whether ground on 
your noble yet chaste favor show unto i 
or her imprisonment for her contempt 
to you by my command my frantic wife 
have put it in his head 

have I then live 
so long now to be doubt be my favor 
the theme of her discourse or what I do 
that never tread in a suspect path 
subject to base construction be undaunted 
for now as of a creature that be i 
I rise up your protectress all the grace 
I hither to have do you be bestow 
with a shut hand it shall be now more free 
open and liberal but let it not 
though counterfeit to the life teach you 
to nourish saucy hope 

may I be blast 
when I prove such a monster 

I will stand then 
between you and all danger he shall know 
suspicion overturn what confidence build 
and he that dare but doubt when there be no ground 
be neither to himself nor other sound 

So let it work her goodness that deny 
my service brand with the name of lust 
shall now destroy itself and she shall find 
when he be a suitor that bring cunning arm 
with power to be his advocate the denial 
be a disease as kill as the plague 
and chastity a clew that lead to death 
hold but thy nature duke and be but rash 
and violent enough and then at leisure 
repent I care not 
and let my plot produce this longedfor birth 
in my revenge I have my heaven on earth 


you promise to be merry 

there be pleasure 
and of all kind to entertain the time 

your excellence vouchsafe to make choice 
of that which best affect you 

hold your prate 
learn manner too you be rude 

I have my answer 
before I ask the question 

I must borrow 
the privilege of a friend and will or else 
I be like these a servant or what be worse 
a parasite to the sorrow Sforza worship 
in spite of reason 

pray you use your freedom 
and so far if you please allow i i 
to hear you only not to be compel 
to take your moral potion I be a man 
and though philosophy your mistress rage for it 
now I have cause to grieve I must be sad 
and I dare show it 

will it be bestow 
upon a worthy subject 

take heed friend 
you rub a sore who pain will make i mad 
and I shall then forget myself and you 
lance it no further 

have you stand the shock 
of thousand enemy and outface the anger 
of a great emperor that vow your ruin 
though by a desperate a glorious way 
that have no precedent be you return with honour 
love by your subject do your fortune court you 
or rather say your courage do command it 
have you give proof to this hour of your life 
prosperity that search the best temper 
can never puff you up nor adverse fate 
deject your valour shall I say these virtue 
so many and so various trial of 
your constant mind be bury in the frown 
to please you I will say so of a fair woman 
yet I have see she equal 

good Pescara 
this language in another be profane 
in you it be unmannerly her equal 
I tell you as a friend and tell you plain 
to all man else my sword shall make reply 
her goodness do disdain comparison 
and but herself admit no parallel 
but you will say she be cross it be fit she shall be 
when I be foolish for she be wise Pescara 
and know how far she may dispose her bounty 
her honour safe or if she be averse 
it be a prevention of a great sin 
ready to fall upon i for she be not ignorant 
but true understand how much I love she 
and that her rare part do deserve all honour 
her excellence increase with her year to 
I may have fall into idolatry 
and from the admiration of her worth 
be teach to think there be no power above she 
and yet I do believe have angel sex 
the most will be such woman and assume 
no other shape when they be to appear 
in their full glory 

well sir I will not cross you 
nor labour to diminish your esteem 
hereafter of she since your happiness 
as you will have it have alone dependence 
upon her favour from my soul I wish you 
a fair atonement 

time and my submission 
may work she to it o you be well return 
say be I bless have she vouchsafe to hear you 
be there hope leave that she may be appease 
let she propound and glad I will subscribe 
to her condition 

she sir yet be froward 
and desire respite and some privacy 

she be harsh at first but ere we part seem not 
implacable 

there be comfort yet I will ply she 
each hour with new ambassador of more honour 
title and eminence my second self 
Francisco shall solicit she 

that a wise man 
and what be more a prince that may command 
shall sue thus poor and treat with his wife 
as she be a victorious enemy 
at who proud foot himself his state and country 
base beg mercy 

what be that you mutter 
I will have thy thought 

you shall you be too fond 
and feed a pride that be swell too big already 
and surfeit with observance 

o my patience 
my vassal speak thus 

let my head answer it 
if I offend she that you think a saint 
I fear may play the devil 

Well say old fellow 

and he that have so long ingross your favour 
though to be name with reverence lord Francisco 
who as you purpose shall solicit for you 
I think be too near she 

hold sir this be madness 

it may be they confer of win lordship 
I be sure he be private with she 

let i go 
I scorn to touch he he deserve my pity 
and not my anger dotard and to be one 
be thy protection else thou dare not think 
that love to my Marcelia have leave room 
in my full heart for any jealous think 
that idle passion dwell with thickskinned tradesman 
the undeserving lord or the unable 
lock up thy own wife fool that must take physic 
from her young doctor upon her back 
because thou have the palsy in that part 
that make her active I can smile to think 
what wretched thing they be that dare be jealous 
be I match to another Messalina 
while I sound merit in myself to please she 
I shall believe her chaste and will not seek 
to find out my own torment but alas 
enjoy one that but to i be a dieu 
I be too secure 

this be a confidence 
beyond example 

there he be now speak 
or be for ever silent 

if you come 
to bring i comfort say that you have make 
my peace with my Marcelia 

I have rather 
wait on you to your funeral 

you be my mother 
or by her life you be dead else 

will you be 
to your dishonour and since dotage make you 
wilful blind borrow of i my eye 
or some part of my spirit be you all flesh 
a limb of patience only no fire in you 
but do your pleasure here your mother be 
commit by your servant for I scorn 
to call he husband and myself your sister 
if that you dare remember such a name 
mew up to make the way open and free 
for the adultress I be unwilling 
to say a part of Sforza 

take her head off 
she have blaspheme and by our law must die 

blaspheme for call of a whore a whore 

o hell what do I suffer 

or be it treason 
for i that be a subject to endeavour 
to save the honour of the duke and that 
he shall not be a wittol on record 
for by postery it will be believe 
as certain as now it can be prove 
Francisco the great minion that sway all 
to meet the chaste embrace of the duchess 
have leap into her bed 

some proof vile creature 
or thou have speak thy last 

the public fame 
their hourly private meeting and even now 
when under a pretence of grief or anger 
you be deny the joy due to a husband 
and make a stranger to she at all time 
the door stand open to he to a Dutchman 
this be enough but to a right italian 
a hundred thousand witness 

will you have we 
to be her bawd 

o the malice 
and envy of base woman that with horror 
know their own defect and inward guilt 
dare lie and swear and damn for what be most false 
to cast aspersion upon one untainted 
you be in your nature devil and your end 
know your reputation sink for ever 
and not to be recover to have all 
wear your black livery wretch you have raise 
a monumental trophy to her pureness 
in this your study purpose to deprave she 
and all the shot make by your foul detraction 
fall upon her surearmed innocence 
return upon yourselves and if my love 
can suffer a addition I be so far 
from give credit to you this will teach i 
more to admire and serve she you be not worthy 
to fall as sacrifice to appease she 
and therefore live till your own envy burst you 

all be in vain he be not to be move 

she have bewitch he 

it be so past belief 
to i it show a fable 

on thy life 
provide my horse and without the port 
with care attend i 

I shall my lord 

he be come 
what crack have we next 

great sir 

Francisco 
though all the joy in woman be flee from i 
in thou I do embrace the full delight 
that I can hope from man 

I will impart 
please you to lend your care a weightysecret 
I be in labour to deliver to you 

all leave the room excuse i good pesc 
ere long I will wait on you 

you speak sir 
the language I shall use 

be within call 
perhaps we may have use of you 

we shall sir 

Say on my comfort 

comfort no your torment 
for so my fate appoint i I can curse 
the hour that give i be 

what new monster 
of misery stand ready to devour i 
let they at once dispatch i 

draw your sword then 
and as you wish your own peace quick kill i 
consider not but do it 

be thou mad 

or if to take my life be too much mercy 
as death indeed conclude all human sorrow 
cut off my nose and ear pull out a eye 
the other only leave to lend i light 
to see my own deformity why be I bear 
without some mulct impose on i by nature 
will from my youth a loathsome leprosy 
have run upon this face or that my breath 
have be infectious and so make i shun 
of all society curse be he that teach i 
discourse or manner or lend any grace 
that make the owner please in the eye 
of wanton woman since those part which other 
value as blessing be to i affliction 
such my condition be 

I be on the rack 
dissolve this doubtful riddle 

that I alone you 
of all mankind that stand most bind to love 
and study your content shall be appoint

o my heartstring 


why can thou think Eugenia that reward

the credulous duke to i prove false and cruel 
it be impossible he can be wrought 
to look on she but with the eye of dotage 
and so to serve she 

such indeed I grant 
the stream of his affection be and run 
a constant course till I with cunning malice 
and yet I wrong my act for it be justice

Indeed I do 
for if my sorrow can receive addition 
her sad fate will increase not lessen they 
she never injure i but entertain 
a fortune humble offer to her hand 
which a wise lady glad will have kneel for 
unless you will impute it as a crime 
she be more fair than I and have discretion 
not to deliver up her virgin fort 
though straight besiege with flattery vow and tear 
until the church have make it safe and lawful 
and have I be the mistress of her judgement 
and constant temper skilful in the knowledge 
of man malicious falsehood I have never 
upon his helldeep oath to marry i 
give up my fair name and my maiden honour 
to his foul lust nor live now be brand 
in the forehead for his whore the scorn and shame 
of all good woman

anger or spleen familiar to your sex 
or be it possible that you can see 
another to possess what be your due 
and not grow pale with envy 

yes of he 
that do deceive i there be no passion that 
a maid so injure ever can partake of 
but I have dear suffer these three year 
in my desire and labour of revenge

of teem woman and will hazard all 
fate can inflict on i but I will reach 
thy heart false Sforza you have trifle with i 
and not proceed with that fiery zeal 
I look for from a brother of your spirit 
sorrow forsake i and all sign of grief 
farewell for ever vengeance arm with fury

the reason sister 
of this strange metamorphosis 

ask thy fear 
thy base unmanly fear thy poor delay 
thy dull forgetfulness equal with death 
my wrong else and the scandal which can never 
be wash off from our house but in his blood 
will have stir up a coward to a deed 
in which though he have fall the brave intent 
have crown itself with a fair monument 
of noble resolution in this shape 
I hope to get access and then with shame 
hear my sudden execution judge 
what honour thou have lose in be transcend 
by a weak woman 

still my own and dear 
and yet in this you but pour oil on fire 
and offer your assistance where it need not 
and that you may perceive I lay not fallow 
but have your wrong stamp deep on my heart 
by the iron pen of vengeance I attempt 
by whore she to cuckold he that fail 
I do begin his tragedy in her death 
to which it serve as prologue and will make 
a memorable story of your fortune 
in my assure revenge only best sister 
let we not lose ourselves in the performance 
by your rash undertake we will be 
as sudden as you can wish 

upon those term 
I yield myself and cause to be dispose of 
as you think fit 

thy purpose 

there be one Graccho 
that follow you it seem upon the tract 
since you leave Milan that be importunate 
to have access and will not be deny 
his haste he say concern you 

bring he to i 
though he have lay a ambush for my life 
or apprehension yet I will prevent he 
and work my own end out 

now for my whip 
and if I now outstrip he not and catch he 
and by a new and strange way to hereafter 
I will swear there be worm in my brain 

now my good Graccho 
we meet as it be by miracle 

love and duty 
and vigilance in i for my lord safety 
first teach i to imagine you be here 
and then to follow you all be come forth my lord 
that you can wish conceal the duchess wound 
in the duke rage put home yet give her leave 
to acquaint he with your practise which your flight 
do easy confirm 

this I expect 
but sure you come provide of good counsel 
to help in my extreme 

I will not hurt you 

how hurt i such another word be thy death 
why dare thou think it can fall in thy will 
to outlive what I determine 

how he awe i 

be brief what bring thou hither 

care to inform you 
you be a condemn man pursue and seek for 
and your head rate at ten thousand ducat 
to he that bring it 

very good 

all passage 
be intercept and choice troop of horse 
scour over the neighbour plain your picture send 
to every state confederate with Milan 
that though I grieve to speak it in my judgement 
so thick your danger meet and run upon you 
it be impossible you shall escape 
their curious search 

why let we then turn roman 
and fall by our own hand mock their threat 
and dreadful preparation 

it will show noble 
but that the honour of our full revenge 
be lose in the rash action no Eugenia 
Graccho be wise my friend to not my servant 
and I dare trust he with my late secret 
we will and thou must help we to perform it 
first kill the duke then fall what can upon we 
for injury be write in brass kind Graccho 
and not to be forget 

he instruct i 
what I shall do 

what be that 

I labour with 
a strong desire to assist you with my service 
and now I be deliver of it 

I tell you 
speak my oraculous Graccho 

I have hear sir 
of man in debt that lay for by their creditor 
in all such place where it can be think 
they will take shelter choose for sanctuary 
their lodging underneath their creditor nose 
or near that prison to which they be design 
if apprehend confident that there 
they never shall be seek for 

it be a strange one 

but what infer you from it 

This my lord 
that since all way of your escape be stop 
in Milan only or what be more in the court 
whether it be presume you dare not come 
conceal in some disguise you may live safe 

and not to be discover 

but by myself 

by thou Alas I know thou honest Graccho 
and I will put thy counsel into act 
and sudden yet not to be ungrateful 
for all thy love travel to preserve i 
what bloody end soever my star appoint 
thou shall be safe good Graccho who be within there 

in the devil name what mean he Ent servant 

take my friend 
into your custody and bind he fast 
I will not part with he 

my good lord 

dispatch 
it be for your good to keep you honest Graccho 
I will not have ten thousand ducat tempt you 
be of a soft and wax like disposition 
to play the traitor nor a foolish itch 
to be revenge for your late excellent whip 
give you the opportunity to offer 
my head for satisfaction why thou fool 
I can look through and through thou thy intent 
appear to i as write in thy forehead 
in plain and easy character and but that 
I scorn a slave base blood shall rust that sword 
that from a prince expect a scarlet dye 
thou now be dead but live only to pray 
for good success to crown my undertake 
and then at my return perhaps I will free thou 
to make i further sport away with he 
I will not hear a syllable we must trust 
ourselves Eugenia and though we make use of 
the counsel of our servant that oil spend 
like snuff that do offend we tread they out 
but now to our last scene which we will so carry 
that few shall understand how it be begin 
till all with half a eye may see it be do 


the like be never read of 

in my judgement 
to all that shall but hear it it will appear 
a most impossible fable 

for Francisco 
my wonder be the less because there be 
too many precedent of unthankful man 
raise up to greatness which have after study 
the ruin of their maker 

but that melancholy 
though end in distraction shall work 
so far upon a man as to compel he 
to court a thing that have nor sense nor be 
be unto i a miracle 

troth I will tell you 
and brief as I can by what degree 
he fall into this madness when by the care 
of his physician he be bring to life 
as he have only pass a fearful dream 
and have not act what I grieve to think on 
he call for fair Marcelia and be tell 
that she be dead he break forth in extreme 
I will not say blaspheme and cry that heaven 
for all the offence that mankind can do 
will never be so cruel as to rob it 
of so much sweetness and of so much goodness 
that not alone be sacred in herself 
but do preserve all other innocent 
that have but converse with she than it come 
into his fancy that she be accuse 
by his mother and his sister thrice he curse they 
and thrice his desperate hand be on his sword 
to have kill they both but he restrain and they 
shun his fury spite of all prevention 
he will have turn his rage upon himself 
when wise his physician look on 
the duchess wound to stay his ready hand 
cry out it be not mortal 

it be well think on 

he easy believe what he wish 
more than a perpetuity of pleasure 
in any object else flatter by hope 
forget his own greatness he fall prostrate 
at the doctor foot implore their aid and swear 
provide they recover she he will live 
a private man and they shall share his dukedom 
they seem to promise fair and every hour 
vary their judgement as they find his fit 
to suffer intermission or extreme 
for his behaviour since 

as you have pity within 
support she gentle 

now be your own witness 
I be prevent 

careful I beseech you 
the gentle touch torment she and then think 
what I shall suffer o you earthy god 
you second nature that from your great master 
who join the limb of tear Hippolytus 
and draw upon himself the thunderer envy 
be teach those hide secret that restore 
to life death wound man you have a patient 
on who to express the excellence of art 
will bind even heaven your debtor though it please 
to make your hand the organ of a work 
the saint will smile to look on and good angel 
clap their celestial wing to give it plaudit 
how pale and wan she look o pardon i 
that I presume die over with bloody guilt 
which make i I confess far far unworthy 
to touch this snowwhite hand how cold it be 
this once be Cupid firebrand and still 
it be so to i how slow her pulse beat to 
yet in this temper she be all perfection 
and mistress of a heat so full of sweetness 
the blood of virgin in their pride of youth 
be ball of snow or ice compare unto she 

be not this strange 

o across he not dear daughter 
our conscience tell we we have be abuse 
wrought to accuse the innocent and with he 
be guilty of a fact 

it be now past help 

with i what be he 

he have a strange aspect 
a jew by birth and a physician 
by his profession as he say who hear 
of the duke frenzy on the forfeit of 
his life will undertake to render he 
perfect in every part provide that 
your lordship favour gain he free access 
and your power with the duke a safe protection 
till the great work be end 

bring i to he 
as I find cause I will do 

how sound she sleep

but answer i with comfort I beseech you 
do your sure judgement tell you that these lid 
that cover rich jewel then themselves 
like envious night will bar these glorious sun 
from shine on i 

we have give her sir 
a sleepy potion that will hold she long 
that she may be less sensible of the torment 
the search of her wound will put she to 

Shee now feel little but if we shall make she 
to hear she speak will fright both we and you 
and therefore dare not hasten it 

I be patient

what do you think she dream of now for sure 
although her body organ be bind fast 
her fancy can slumber 

that sir look on 
your sorrow for your late rash art with pity 
o what you suffer for it and prepare 
to meet with free confession of your guilt 
with a glad pardon 

Shee be ever kind 
and her displeasure though call on short live 
upon the least submission o you power 
that can convey our thought to one another 
without the end of eye or ear assist i 
let she behold i in a please dream 
thus on my knee before she yet that duty 
in i be not sufficient let she see i 
compel my mother from who I look life 
and this my sister partner of my be 
to bow thus low unto she let she hear we 
in my acknowledgement free confess 
that we in a degree as high be guilty 
as she be innocent bite your tongue vile creature 
and let your inward horror fright your soul 
for have belie that pureness to come near which 
all woman that posterity can bring forth 
must be though strive to be good poor rival 
and for that dog Francisco that seduce i 
in wound she to raise a temple build 
to chastity and sweetness let she know 
I will follow he to hell but I will find he 
and there live a four fury to torment he 
then for this curse hand and arm that guide 
the wicked steel I will have they joint by joint 
with burn iron sear of which I will eat 
I be a vulture fit to taste such carrion 
last 

you be too loud sir you disturb 
her sweet repose 

I be hush yet give we leave 
thus prostrate at her foot our eye bend downward 
unworthy and ashamed to look upon she 
to expect her gracious sentence 

he be past hope 

the body to will putrify and then 
we can no long cover the imposture 

which in his death will quick be discover 
I can but weep his fortune 

yet be careful 
you lose no minute to preserve he time 
may lessen his distraction 

I be no god sir 
to give a new life to she yet I will hazard 
my head I will work the senseless trunk to appear 
to he as it have get a second be 
or that the soul that be flee from it be call back 
to govern it again I will preserve it 
in the first sweetness and by a strange vapour 
which I will infuse into her mouth create 
a seem breath I will make her vein run high to 
as if they have true motion 

do but this 
till we use mean to win upon his passion 
to indure to hear she be dead with some small patience 
and make thy own reward 

the art I use 
admit no looker on I only ask 
the four part of a hour to perfect that 
I bold undertake 

I will procure it 

what stranger be this

flow strong lie to you 

from whence come that sound 
be it from my Marcelia if it be 
I rise and joy will give i wing to meet it 

nor shall your expectation be defer 
but a few minute your physician be 
mere voice and no performance I have find 
a man that can do wonder do not binder 
the duchess wish recovery to inquire 
or what he be or to give thanks but leave he 
to work this miracle
