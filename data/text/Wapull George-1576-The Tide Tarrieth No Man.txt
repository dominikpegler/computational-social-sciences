 by the mass sir so where he be 

 I tell thou that hair we shall he not miss 

 good master courage most hearty good even Salute courage 

 in faith my friend welcome all three by saint Steven 
jesus good lord how do you fare 
cover your head why be you bare 
and how sir now sir lead you your life 
which of all you three now the best thrive 

 tush man none of we can do amiss 
for we do always take time while time be 
and wherever we go like counsel we give 
tell all man that here they shall not still live 

 therein hurtful help thou do very well 
the tide tarry no man thou must always tell 

 indeed hurtful help that be my name 
but I will not that all man shall know the same 
for I be a broker the truth be so 
wherefore if man in i hurtfulness shall know 
there be few or none that with i will deal 
therefore this word hurtful I never reveal 
my name I say plain help to be 
wherefore each man for help do come unto i 
good master help help to that or this 
and of good reward you shall not miss 

 and as thou from help hurtful do throw 
so paint from profit I must forgo 
for if any man know i for profit but paint 
man will but little with i be acquaint 
my master who a good gentleman be 
think i as profitable as he can wish 
so that plain profit be think my name 
and before his face my deed show the same 

 farewell my master for I may hence walk 
for I see you two will have all the talk 

 what feign furtherance be you so coy 
will you never leave the trick of a boy 
come again I say lest I do you fetch 
and say what thou will here shall no man let 

 fetch i 

 yea fetch thou 

 marry do what thou dare 

 that will I not spare out quick with his dagger 

 good sir hold your hand and bear with his rudeness 

 nay I can nor will not suffer his lewdness 

 tush a fig for he let he do what he can 

 alas sir who be you but a merchant man 
good sir what you be we know right well 
who be your master and where you do dwell 
you profess that your master you do great further 
and yet for his good you will he glad murder 

 if so I do wish it be long of thou 
for thou thereunto baste encourage i 

 what hush I say no more of these word 
for appeach oft the appeacher disturb 
be friend again as you be at the first 
let each man say the best and leave out the worst 

 I for my part do thereunto consent and shake hand 

 then give i thy hand if thou be content 
now be we friend as at first we be 
therefore straight way thy mind let we here 

 true I mean to do even as do the rest 
for in my opinion that be the best 
and as hurt help have hurt forgo 
and paint profit be profit alone 
so I feign furtherance henceforth do mind 
to be furtherance plain leave feign behind 
other man furtherance to seek I will say 
yet will I seek my own as much as I may 

 else be thou unwise yea and a very fool 
thou learn none otherwise I trow in my school 
I be a schoolmaster for you three most fit 
who endue you with courage instead of great wit 

 to be our master will thou take in hand 
why we be as good as thou thou shall understand 

 alas poor knave what can you three do 
if you have not courage belong thereto 

 and what can courage do without help 
as much as a kitling or suckle whelp 

 and by hurtful help what be I the better 
be help to a hurt I be no great getter 

 it be folly with thou thus to contend 
we be as good as thou and so I do end 

 since that by word I can no mastery have 
I will prove what my manhood will do sir knave 

 why be thou blind may thou not see 
that again thou one we be here three 

 and what can three do against one 
I have courage and they have none 
therefore courage will claw you or you go hence 
now defend yourselves I will see your fence 

 what courage I say thy hand now stay 

 will you then consent to that which I say 

 there be no remedy but we must consent 
sometime it be good a fool mind to content 
therefore I be content to be thy inferior 
and I will from henceforth take thou for superior 

 and so will the residue I trow also 

 if you say I sir we will not say no 

 well sir than I will show you my mind 
but first I will describe you each one in his kind 
thou help art a broker between man and man 
whereby much deceit thou use now and than 
profit be one who by service in sight 
do cause his master to think he most right 
a profitable servant he think he to be 
because he be profitable while he do he see 
and feign furtherance do fain he to further 
his master and other who fain he will murder 
thus in seek wealth you all do agree 
and yet you profess other friend for to be 

 ne cuique sapit qui sibi non sapit 
this say I read whenas I go to school 
one not wise for himself be but a very fool 

 by my troth and of that opinion be I 
and in that opinion I mean for to die 

 tush why spend you time in speak of that 
while thereon you talk in vain be your chat 
for who help not himself before any other 
I count he a fool if he be my brother 
and as I count he all people do so 
therefore cease this talk and hence let we go 
for some of we may chance to meet with a chide 
because that so long from home we be bide 

 by S anne I think therein thou say well 
for I know thereof I be like to here tell 

 why man a little while break no square 

 tush help have excuse to colour that care 

 yea but already we have tarry too long 

 why then you be best go without a song 

 nay I will tarry to sing though therefore I shall die 

 my help to sing I do never deny 

 why then sir have at it courageous the song first courage cause mind of man to wish for good or ill and some by courage now and then at Tyburn make their will help profit and furtherance do fain where courage do catch in any man brain  then help in hope to have his prey full secret do wait and as the time do serve always he throw forth his bait help profit etc  profit prolong not the time to please his paint mind he pass not though master pine so he his pleasure find help profit etc  and furtherance thou last of all he come into the rout he weigh not his master thrall nor seek to help he out help profit etc Finis 
first courage cause mind of man 
to wish for good or ill 
and some by courage now and then 
at Tyburn make their will 
help profit and furtherance do fain 
where courage do catch in any man brain 
 then help in hope to have his prey 
full secret do wait 
and as the time do serve always 
he throw forth his bait 
help profit etc 
 profit prolong not the time 
to please his paint mind 
he pass not though master pine 
so he his pleasure find 
help profit etc 
 and furtherance thou last of all 
he come into the rout 
he weigh not his master thrall 
nor seek to help he out 
help profit etc 

 now courage farewell for we must be go 

 nay sir you two shall not go alone 
for I do mean to bear you company 
and so shall we be even a whole trinity 
therefore courage adowe they three go out 

 sir here be a trinity in a witness 
a man may have shape three knave by their likeness 
a trinity much like to the trinity of late 
where good wife gull break her good man pate 
in come her man to make up the number 
who have his nose shall with the steel of a scumber 
but in fine these three begin to agree 
and knit themselves up in one trinity 
and after they love like brother and brother 
for very love they do kill one another 
and then they be bury I do well remember 
in Stawton straw hat seven mile from December 
where they have not lie the space of a day 
but four of those three be thence run away 
the constable come with a back on his bill 
and because they be go he do they kill 
I courage so cleave their cushion asunder 
to see how they bleed it make i to wonder 
I myself be smite twice to the ground 
I be very sore hurt but I have not a wound 
I buskle myself as though fight I will 
and take i to my leg as fast as I can 
and so with much pain hither I do come 
but hush sir I say no more word but mum 

enter  tush talk not of that for in vain you do prate 
for there be none but fool that wealthiness do hate 

 what greediness I say why what be the matter 
master wealthiness I will say whereon do you clatter 

 what old friend courage be thou so near hand 
marry I will show thou how the matter do stand 
as I walk along through by the street 
by such way as my affair do lie 
it be my chance with a preacher to meet 
who company to have I do not deny 
and as we two together do walk 
amongst other communication we have 
the preacher break out with reproachable talk 
say that we citizen be all too bad 
some of we he say be greedy gut all 
and evil member of a common wealth 
he say we care not who we bring to thrall 
neither have we regard unto our soul health 
his talk I confess my conscience do nip 
wherefore no long I will he abide 
but sudden I give he the slip 
and cross the way to the other side 
so alone I let master preacher walk 
and here by chance I stumble in 

 and be thou so foolish for any such talk 
to cease or stay thy wealth for to win 

 serra he cry out of excessive gain 
say when any of our ware have need 
then do we hoist they up to their pain 
and common make they pay for their speed 

 I perceive that fellow be hot of the spirit 
he will not have you take time while time be 
if you follow his council he will beggar you quite 
but what answer do thou give he to this 

 why thou know my quality be such 
that by contrary talk I use no man to blame 
for although often my doing they touch 
yet my talk always to the time I frame 
when he say excessive gainer be ill 
I say for they it be a shame 
and in all thing else I please his will 
and so I feign myself without blame 

 thou do wise therein I commend thou therefore 
for whatever thou think yet say as they do 
so shall thou have their favour evermore 
and that be no blame thou shall come unto 

 yea but true his word do my conscience prick 
of i he do so unhappy guess 
I promise she he touch i unto the quick 
for that in gain I use excess 
my conscience do tell i I have do amiss 
and of long time I have go astray 
and a thousand witness the conscience be 
as Sallust in most plain word do say 

 why doltish patch be thou so unwise 
to quail for the say of such a knave 
thou know all the world will thou despise 
and beg thou may go if that nought thou have 
and how shall thou have aught 
if thy gain be not great 
Consider this well in thy mind 
remember thy house and thy wife that peat 
must still be keep in their costly kind 
therefore take the time while the time do serve 
tide tarry no man this thou do know 
if thy good decay then may thou starve 
so do thou seek thy own overthrow 

 in deed as thou say it do i behoove 
not so rash to lay my gain aside 
lest so myself a fool I do prove 
by shoot from my profit so wide 
I consider my wealth be now at good stay 
which I will be loath shall be impair 
for once rich and after in decay 
be a miserable thing as Hyemes have declare 
therefore I mean thy council to take 
lest of that misery I know the smart 
then be it to late any moan to make 
or from such foolishness to revert 
therefore courage adieu unto thou 
for it behoove i hence to depart exeunt 

 adieu wealthiness till again we see 
adieu great greediness with all my heart 
have not courage contagious now show his kind 
by encourage greediness unto evil 
which late be draw to a better mind 
and now again do follow the devil 

 lo thou neighbourhood where courage do stand 

 what no good neighbourhood give i thy hand 

 those two first syllable may be put out 
and than thou hit my name without doubt 

 why be not not good neighbourhood thy name 

 put away no good and see how it will frame 
for if thou do put away no good 
there rest no more but neighbourhood 

 then be it neighbourhood neither good nor bad 
nay though we leave the first it be good the next we have 
for leave out no put good to the rest 
then be it good neighbourhood thus I think be best 

 nay I will have they both two leave out 
because of my name man shall stand in doubt 
for if no good neighbourhood I be name 
then of all man I shall be blame 
and if that good to neighbourhood I have 
man will say I do it praise to crave 
so I will leave out both no and good 
and will be indifferent sole neighbourhood 

 then neighbourhood be it if so it shall be 
and neighbourhood what be thy errand to i 

 sir my come be for occasion two 
the first be for your council what be best to do 
in a matter which I have late begin 
if I shall proceed or else leave it undo 
the second be if I shall proceed 
that you will stand my friend if I need 

 assure thyself thereof without doubt 
therefore show i the matter thou go about 

 I thank you sir even with all my heart 
and I trust also that help will do his part 

 doubt not but that I to thou will be cleave 
therefore proceed and show he thy meaning 

 then sir this be the matter if it shall please you give ear 
I have a neighbour who dwell to i somewhat near 
who have a tenement commodious and feat 
to which tenement I bear a love very great 
this man my neighbour as far as I can learn 
have in his tenement but a short term 
four or five year or there about 
which term you know will soon be wear out 
now sir may I in reversion a lease thereof have 
I will give the landlord even what he will crave 

 and who be the landlord thereof can you tell 

 master greediness a man who you know right well 
he be one which never do money hate 

 why then speak in time lest thou be too late 
the tide tarry no man the proverb have say 
therefore see no time herein be delay 
master help here shall be to thou a stay 
for with master greediness he bear great sway 

 I will do for he what lie in i 

 and then to your pain I will glad see 

 doubt not then but thou shall have thy mind 

 as you say I wish that I may it find 
but I doubt that of my purpose I shall miss 
by reason of one thing and that be this 
my foresay neighbour which now hold the same 
have be there a long dweller of good name and fame 
and well he be belove both of young and old 
wherefore not only the neighbour with he will hold 
but also the landlord I be in great doubt 
will be therefore unwilling to put he out 
and I but a strange among they god wot 

 marry sir it be much the better for that 
for if thou be more strange and bear out of the land 
thou shall soon have it I dare take in hand 
for among we now such be our country zeal 
that we love best with stranger to deal 
to sell a lease dear whosoever that will 
at the french or dutch church let he set up his bill 
and he shall have chapman I warrant you good store 
look what a english man bid they will give as much more 
we broker of stranger well know the gain 
by they we have good reward for our pain 
therefore though thou be strange the matter be not great 
for thy money be English which must work the feat 

 in deed my money as a neighbour will agree 
with any man wheresoever it be 
and I myself will be a neighbour to 
and therefore the father I do that I do 
for if it be not to be a neighbour by they 
I wiss I will not take a house so nigh they 

 I dare say each man will be glad at his heart 
to have all his neighbour such as thou be 
what matter be it if thou thyself be speed 
though thou take thy neighbour house over his head 

 tush that be no harm but rather it be good 
for he do it only for pure neighbourhood 
see yonder come one if thou can make he thy friend 
then may thou short bring thy purpose to end 

 now master courage how do you fare 

 even glad to see that you so merry be 
furtherance you must pleasure a friend of i 

 thereto I be ready at each tide and time 
to do for he what in i do lie 
therefore let i know your mind by and by 

 serra of thy master a lease he will have 
and therein thy friendship it be he do crave 

 sir if that herein my friend you will stand 
I will give you therefore even what you will demand 

 then neighbourhood thou shall short see 
that I can do somewhat between my master and thou 
thou can never speak better to speed 
for of money now he stand in need 
to pay for a purchase of certain land 
which needs he must discharge out of hand 
therefore this time for thou well do fall 
if that thou have money to tempt he withal 

 tush man for money I will not spare 

 then need thou no whit for to care 
and if thou take pain now to walk home 
there shall thou find he sit alone 

 cock passion man hie thou away 
thou know the tide for no man will stay 

 why sir but will you not walk with we thither 

 no do help and you go before together 
and I warrant you I will not long be behind you 
for though I be absent yet I will mind you 

 then sir adieu till we meet again 
doubt not but I will consider your pain 
Come help shall we go 

 it be time I trow exiunt 

 ah sir this gear do trim fall out 
I know this lease which he go about 
wherefore I will work so on both the side 
that of both party I will obtain bribe 
I will show the old tenant how one go about 
to take his house and to thrust he out 
wherefore he will large grease i in the hand 
because his friend therein I shall stand 
the other here do promise i plain 
that he will reward i for my pain 
therefore courage farewell unto thou 
for how this gear will frame I will see 

 farewell furtherance my gentle friend 
a man may seek hell and such two not find 
I mean a friend so worthy to trust 
and a neighbour that be so honest and just 
of honesty I trow he be meet well speed 
that will take his neighbour house over his head 
I think there be no man within this place 
but he will glad such neighbour embrace 
where two such neighbour die out of one town 
the devil shall be sure to have one black gown 
as well he be worthy if I may be judge 
for in their affair he daily do trudge 
good council he give they both morning and evening 
what mean they shall work to their neighbour grieve 
he teach they how to pill and to poule 
in hope after death to have body and soul 
tush what mean I thus of soul for to speak 
in vain with such talk my brain I do break 
for soul there be none when the body be dead 
in such kind of doctrine my scholar I lead 
therefore say I take time while time be 
for after this life there be nothing but bliss 
there be no soul any pain to abide 
the teacher contrary from truth be far wide 

 o so my heart be fill with doubt 
which way I may work my worship to win 
shall I leave of courtier so jolly a rout 
and eke of lady a company so trim 
and shall I home to my cottage rude 
there to live like a country clown 
true I know not which way to conclude 
to get myself worship and renown 
to win worship I will be right glad 
therefore willing to win worship be my name 
in the country there be none such to be have 
and the court do ask great cost for the same 
so that what I shall do I know not yet 
I consider it be towards a good time 
wherein triumph be use as be most fit 
and where courtier must show themselves brave and fine 
but this I conclude as force I be 
the court for to leave and homeward to pack 
for where be the money here be the man 
if man he may be that money do lack 

 sir be you so foolish the court for to leave 
when the time be that worship you shall win 
for in time of triumph we always perceive 
the courtier worship do first begin 
therefore do you from such foolishness stay 
and fortune may chance give you as you wish 

 but the wheel of fortune as Socrates do say 
be like the snare wherewith man take fish 
and in another place Plautus do show 
a say in latin and that be this 
festo die si quid prodigeris 
profesto egere liceat nisi pepereris 
if on the holiday waste thou do use 
on the work day thou may beg unless well thou get 
so in triumph like effect ensue 
that next after waste indigence be set 

 then periander word you account lest 
who unto honour a encourager be 
honour say he immortalis est 
now sir I pray you how like you this 

 those word to be true I must needs confess 
for honour in deed be a immortal fame 
and now be the time the same to possess 
but I have not wherewith to achieve the same 
for money be he that the man must deck 
and though I have attire both costly and gay 
yet unless it be new I shall have but a geck 
therefore much better for i be away 

 tush man for money be thou not sad 
you courtier I know have jewel good store 
and money for jewel will always be have 
therefore for that matter care thou no more 

 yea but how it be have I partly do know 
and what excessive interest be pay 
therefore you may say the more be my woe 
will God that I have it never assay 

 well whatever it cost it must needs be have 
therefore withstand not thy fortunate chance 
for I will count thou fool worse than mad 
if thou will not spend money thyself to advance 
now be the time of hap good or ill 
venture it therefore while it be hot 
for the tide will not tarry for any man will 
never shall thou speed if now thou speed not 

 true this talk do encourage i so much 
that to see the court again I do pretend 
but I pray thou do thou know any such 
as use upon gauge money to lend 

 why man for that matter you need not to doubt 
of such man there be enough everywhere 
but see how lucky it do fall out 
see yonder two friend of i do appear 
there be a broker between man and man 
whenas any bargain they have in hand 
the other a merchant man now and than 
in borrow money thy friend they may stand 

 so be we in deed and what of that 
who be it that with by will any thing have 

 even i a gentleman who money do lack 
and therein your friendship will glad crave 

 therein we can help you if your pleasure it be 
and will do or else we be great to blame 
provide always that to our pain you do see 
and also put in a good pawn for the same 

 a pawn sufficient I will therefore lay 
and also your pain I will recompense well 
but I must needs have it out of the way 
although my land therefore I do sell 

 you shall have it sir so soon as you will 
and therein you shall be friendly use 
for in friendly use this fellow have skill point to furtherance 
therefore his counsel must not be refuse 
he be servant unto a merchant man 
who be partly rule after his mind 

 in deed as you say help i he can 
I doubt not but his friendship I shall find 
doubt you not sir but in pleasure i 
I will recompense your pain with the most 

 what I can do for you soon you shall see 
it be but folly thereof for to boast 

 well then it be time that hence we be pack 
for fain a end thereof I will know 

 why sir no diligence in we shall be lack 
for we be ready if that you be so 

 why then that we go I think it be best 
think you your master be now at home 

 you I know well at home he do rest 
and I guess that now he be sit alone 
therefore no long here let we stay 

 then sir adieu for I will lead the way 

 now may you see how courage can work 
and how he can encourage both to good and bad 
the merchant be encourage in greediness to lurk 
and the courtier to win worship by courage be glad 
the one be good no man will denay 
I mean courage to win worship and fame 
so that the other be ill all man will say 
that be courage to greediness which get ill name 
thus may you see courage contagious 
and eke contrarious both in i do rest 
for I of kind be always various 
and change as to my mind seem best 
between man and wife sometime I do show 
both my kindness when my pleasure it be 
the goodwife give her husband a blow 
and he for reward do give she a kiss 
the goodwife by courage be hardy and stout 
the goodman contrary be patient and meek 
and suffer himself to be call lout 
yea and worse misuse thrice in a week 
How say you good wife be it not so 
I warrant you not one that can say nay 
whereby all man here may right well know 
that all this be true which I do say 
but yet courage tell you not all that he know 
for then he must tell of each wife the name 
which be no great matter the best be but shrew 
but I will not say so for fear I have blame 

 now courage I say what news in the cost 
what good tiding abroad do thou hear 

 why what do thou hear hie thou home in post 
for I send home a gentleman to seek for thou there 

 and what be the matter that with i he will have 

 he must borrow some money his worship to save 

 tush then to tarry he will be glad 
if that he come any money to borrow 

 yea but take the time while it be to be have 
and defer not thy profit until tomorrow 
this gentleman be a courtier brave 
and now in need of money do stand 
therefore thy own ask of he thou may have 
so that thou will pleasure he out of hand 

 and be he a courtier and stand in need 
this to my purpose do right fall 
for the needy courtier my coffer do feed 
and I warrant thou that pinch he I shall 
for since I know his need to be such 
that money he must needs occupy 
I know I can ask he too much 
if I his mind will satisfy 
therefore now courage to thou adieu Fayne a go out 

 nay soft sir yet one word with you 
you tell i not yet how you do agree 
with no good neighbourhood that good man grout 

 marry sir he have go through with i 
and the old tenant he will thrust out 
but I with that matter have nought to do 
let they two now for that agree 
I know I shall never have come unto 
so much as therefore he have pay to i 
therefore I may be count mad 
if I to his proffer will not have tend 
this profitable lesson which of thou I have 
the tide tarry no man be not unremembered 

 god speed sir I pray you show i if you can 
do you not master wealthiness here about see 

 cock passion this be the gentleman man 
which at home do tarry for thou 
sir wealthiness be not hence far away 

 I be he sir what will you of i require 

 my master at home for your worship do stay 
and to speak with you he do great desire 
if it be your pleasure home to repair 
or if you will he shall hither come 
your masterships pleasure therefore declare 
and I know incontinent it shall be do 

 nay I mean homeward to hie 
for that I suppose to be the best 
and by all the mean that in i do lie 
I will fulfil your master request 

 I trust also you will consider my pain 
thereby I trust you shall not lose 
for perchance I may prefer your gain 
by mean which with my master I do use 

 as I find thou ready in further of i 
so doubt thou not but thou shall find 
i even as ready in pleasure of thou 
a word be enough thou know my mind 
therefore hence let we now take the way 

 my master think we long I dare say exiunt 

 I warrant you I will not be long behind 
I know no cause why here I shall stay 
a company of my scholar I know where to find 
therefore towards they I will take the way exiunt 

 whether shall I go or which way shall I take 
to find a christian constant and just 
each man himself a christian will make 
yet few or none that a man may trust 
but for the most part feign incline to lust 
as to insatiable covetousness most abominable 
or some other vice most vile and detestable 
it be well know what rigour do reign 
in that cruel tiger my landlord greediness 
who in my house will not let i remain 
but have thrust i out with spiteful speediness 
have no respect to my naked neediness 
but altogether regard his gain 
have bereave my live from i to my pain 
what neighbourhood be may also be see 
my neighbour suppose be my deadly foe 
what cruel chance like to mine have be 
both my house and live I must now forgo 
what neighbour be he that have serve i so 
thus cruel to take my house over my head 
wherein these forty year I have be harbour and 〈◊〉 
and now be age must thus be thrust out 
with my impotent wife charge and family 
now how I shall live I stand in great doubt 
lead and end my life in misery 
but better do so then as they live by thou very 
catch and snatch all that ever they can 
because that say they tide tarry no man 
but God grant that they in follow that tide 
lose not the tide of God mercy and grace 
I doubt that from they away it will slide 
if they still pursue the contrary race 
as daily they do God law to deface 
to their own soul hurt and to their neighbour damage 
still follow the instruction of curse courage 
I see who I seek be not here to be find 
I mean Christianity constant and just 
I doubt that in bondage he lie fast bind 
or else he be dead and lie bury in dust 
but if he be live to find he I trust 
therefore till I find he I will nowhere stay 
neither in seek of he I will make delay 

 ah sirrah I can choose but rejoice 
when I remember my little pretty boy 
my scholar I mean who all with one voice 
cry we love courage without other choice 
the young nymph I encourage and lead 
in riotous footstep so trim to tread 
that guilty and unguilty often they plead 
and be find guilty hang all save the head 
the virgin which be but tender of age 
rather than their trim attire shall assuage 
their fail for new they will lay to gauge 
to every slave peasant and page 
the grand signior which in year be ripe 
with covetous claw like the greedy gripe 
their poor brethren from their living do wipe 
and evermore dance after courage pipe 
courage never in quiet do lie 
but the tide tarry no man still he do cry 
therefore work thy will by and by 
that rich thou may be whenever thou die 

 of all misfortune i be the worst 
true I think I be accurse 
when I be a infant not full nurse 
alas for grief my heart it will burst 
I daily see woman as young as I 
which in white cap our door do go by 
I be as able as they with a man to lie 
yet my mother do still my wedding deny 
she say for wedding that I be unfit 
maid of fourteen year she say have no wit 
and so every day she say I shall tarry yet 
that will God I be put quick in the pit 
God wot we maid abide much misery 
and always keep in from have liberty 
of evil tongue we walk in jeopardy 
most people be now so full of jealousy 
if a youngman a maid do but kiss 
now say the people you may see what she be 
where if I be a wife nothing I shall miss 
but live like a lady in all joyful bliss 
I right well do know the people spite 
because that to be pleasant I have delight 
therefore past grace they say I be quite 
and a wilful wanton my name they do wright 
yet I trust in God once to see the day 
that to recompense their spite I may 
for if ever I be marry and bear any sway 
than I know what I have to say 
therefore good God make i short a wife 
or else short take away my life 

 alas pretty Parnell you may soon end this strife 
young man fit for husband in this town be rife 
and your mother ill will you may soon prevent 
if you will follow my council and intent 

 o but if my mother will thereto consent 
to be marry this night I can be content 

 but consent she or not yet be it for thou 
unto thy own preferment to see 
do thou with any young man so agree 
that he will consent thy husband to be 

 diverse there be who glad will have i 
and be their wife will trim bebrave i 
from all wrong they will defend and save i 
tush enough there be which to wife do crave i 

 then defer no time if that thou be wise 
for now to preferment thou be like to arise 
the tide tarry no man else the proverb lie 
in delay come harm thou sée with thy eye 
but by marriage all thy grief shall be ease 
and thy joy shall manifold way be increase 

 but alas my mother will so be displease 
that I know her wrath will never be appease 

 and will thou for displease of she 
thy own preferment and fortune defer 
now be thou youthful thyself to prefer 
and thy youthful beauty man heart may steer 
but youthful beauty will not always last 
the tide tarry no man but soon it be past 
therefore to wedding see thou make haste 
for now much time thou do lose in waste 

 o what comfortable word be these 
true your talk do i great please 
I will not stint but seek out always 
until that I have find some ease 
I care not what my mother do say 
this matter I will no long delay 
but a husband I will have out of the way 
and then may I bold dally and play 
no man dare i then once to control 
lest my husband chance for to scowl 
if any man use to entreat i foul 
my husband will lay he over the noll 
it do i good to think of the bliss 
which between new marry couple be 
to see their dalliance sometime iwis 
it set my tooth a edge by gisse 
true I will glad give my best frock 
and all thing else unto my smock 
to be marry in the morning by vi of the clock 
I beshrew my heart if that I do mock 
sir you will not believe how I long 
to be one of the wed throng 
my think it lie in no tongue 
to show the joy that be they among 

 it pass joy which they embrace 
they take their pleasure in every place 
like angel they do run their race 
in pass bliss and great solace 

 well sir I will no long tarry 
but some man out of hand will marry 
although from my mother mind I vary 
yet your word in mind I carry 
therefore good sir to you adieu 
until again I meet with you 
if I speed well a good coat new 
to your part may chance ensue exiunt

 his send woman we daily do see 
be a staff and a wallet unto such

who joy may be compare to i 
I have a wife beautiful and gay 
she be young pleasant proper and fine 
and pliant to please i both night and day 
for who shall I pinch for who shall I spare 
why shall I not be liberal and free 
however the world go I do not care 
I have enough for my wife and i 
and if my substance chance to decay 
I know my credit be not so ill 
but that I can borrow twenty pound always 
to serve i at my pleasure and will 
for repayment thereof no care I will take 
no matter it be if the same I may get 
while it last therewith I will merry make 
what skill it though that I come in debt 
while young I be youthful I will be 
and pass my time in youthful sort 
for as my wife here say unto i 
age do delight in no pleasant sport 
wherefore since pleasure I do love 
in youth it behoove to take the same 
nothing there from my heart shall move 
but I thereto my heart will frame 
I fear i that I tarry to long 
my wife do look for i before this 
therefore homeward I will be go 
for there be joy and heavenly bliss exiunt 

 what infidelity in he do rest 
who no time forbear to take his prey 
most like the greedy or savage beast 
who in cruelty rage both night and day 
may he not the space of one sermon stay 
what care or mind give he to god word 
who at preach thereof do i so disturb 
be the sabbath day and Paul cross 
a time and place to vex thy debtor 
or have thou greediness by i have any loss 
nay by i thou be a hundred pound the better 
I speak of the least and not of the great 
yet I never deny my debt for to pay 
but in deed I require a long day 

 tush sir this talk be all but in vain 
mean you thus the time to delay 
dispatch therefore and please i for my pain 
and towards the counter let we away 

 no haste but good stay yet a while 
or else take the pain with i for to walk 
about the quantity of half a mile 
with a friend of i that I may talk 

 for a royal I will not so far go 
therefore set your heart at quiet 

 I mean to please no sergeant so 
I be no customer for your diet 
but since to go you do not intend 
you must take pain here to tarry with i 
until for a friend of i I do send 
which I trust short my bail will be 

 neither will I with thou here remain 
therefore dispatch and let we away 
think thou that I have nought for my pain 
will either go with thou or hear for thou stay 

 and what will thou ask with i here to stay 
at one word let i that understand 

 at one word ten groat thou shall pay 
or else to the counter we must out of hand 

 that will I do with a right good will 
rather than so much thou shall get 
I will not so much thy mind fulfil 
if that my heart my hand may let 

 why then with speed let we away 
this deed thou will repent I trow 

 well wherefore now do we stay 
I be ready hence to go 

 come on then 

 Christianity I do represent 
muse not though the sword of policy I bear 
neither marvel not what be my intent 
that this failable shield of riches I wear 
greedy great will have it so everywhere 
greedy great for this cause I have name 
for that the great part use greediness which be to be blame 
as the great part will thereto must I yield 
their cruel force I may not withstand 
therefore I bear this deform sword and shield 
which I may be ashamed to hold in my hand 
but the lord deliver i from their thraldom and band 
for if the enemy assail i then be I in thrall 
because I lack such armour as be teach by S Paul 
for in stead of God word and the shield of faith 
I be deform with policy and riches vain 
and still I say as the great part say 
I be still a christian and so shall remain 
my christianity say they no damage do sustain 
but alas they be deceive their armour be not sure 
for neither policy nor riches may long time endure 
yet upon those two we great depend 
we say by policy ourselves we can save 
riches as a shield we say will defend 
and by riches we possess whatever we crave 
so that for riches we sell all that we have 
not only the body and all thing terestriall 
but also the soul which ought be celestial 

 alas I lament to hear the report 
which of we citizen in every place be spread 
it be not long since I come from the court 
where I will have be glad to have hide my head 
with the spoil of the simple there they say be feed 
so that for the covetous greediness which some citizen use 
a shameful ill report to the whole ensue 
but I must needs confess some among we there be 
for who sake the whole number bear great blame 
they abuse themselves so towards every degree 
as man without reason and past worldly shame 
neither regard they their own nor their ill name 
so they may have the chassy treasure of the world 
they pass not both with God and man to be abhor 
there be no time nor place that they will forbear 
when any of their help have most need 
then shall he pay treble for his money or ware 
or else of they he be not like to speed 
they nothing regard his poverty or need 
but who be it which yonder do stand he go towards he 
hold the sword of policy in his hand 
most certain I be that face I shall know 
sir be not your name Christianity 

 yes undoubted my name be so 
as you be faithful few embracer of verity 

 and shall the sword of policy by Christianity be bear 
true that be contrary to your nature and kind 
now be you deform like a thing forlorn 
which make i suspect of i in my mind 

 o faithful few of i have no doubt 
I be Christianity though thus deform 
and though thus abuse by the great rout 
yet by God I trust my title shall be turn 

 by the power of God I will not delay he turn the title 
to turn this title most untrue and feign 
and I will endue thou and that straight way 
with such weapon as saint Paul have ordain 

 alas in vain this pain you do take 
for as you faithful in number be few 
so the power be but small that you can make 
to resist the greedy great one who be against you 

 si deus nobiscum quis contranos 
if God be with we who may we resist 
weigh not then the number but weigh his purpose 
who rule all thing as himself do lift 
I know how greediness with the great part be use 
their pill poul pinch and spoil 
how both the simple and other with they be abuse 
they live by the fruit of other man toil 
but God be not dead neither be he asleep 
although for a time his hand he do hold 
yet do he remember his little sheep 
and will revenge the wrong do to his fold 

 let they say what they will do thou as I tell thou 
trust thou not to any knave of they all 
not a preacher of they all in thy need will uphold thou 
try they who will their devotion be small 

 thou will not believe how the knave do prate 
you citizen repent thus he do cry 
look about in time quoth he or it be too late 
for the vengeance of God at hand be full nigh 
as though he know what be in God mind 
sure it be a shame they be so suffer to lie 

 but in my talk great profit thou do find 
they be all liar as their talk do try 
by my doctrine thou haste great profit and gain 
great riches and substance thereby thou do win 
to instruct thou daily I take great pain 
which way thou shall thy riches bring in 

 thou do so in deed and thanks I thou give 
but sirrah now I remember a thing 
which make i not long since to laugh in my sleeve 
to i a young gentleman the broker do bring 
who father be dead of late as it seem 
and his land in mortgage to a merchant be lay 
wherefore it behoove the same be redeem 
for the day be at hand when the same shall be pay 
and I perceive his need to be such 
I think I will pinch he or that I go 
to give my own ask he do not great grudge 
and when I have gird he thence I he send 

 more shame for thou and such as thou be 
that with life thou be permit it be great pity 
thou be a christian with a canker heart 
and the cause of reproach to a whole city 
Christianity by thou be great abuse 
of his righteous armour thou do he bereave 
and in stead thereof by he to be use 
the armour of Satan with he thou do leave 

 why will you not have i how to invent 
which way be best to bring in my gain 

 but not in such sort to set thy intent 
that all the world of thou shall complain 

 I cry you mercy I know where you be now 
in a courtier behalf this oration you make 
of late there be one complain how 
excessive gain of he I do take 
it be the cast of they all so to say 
when prodigal their money be spend 
or if the prince will they not pay 
then on the merchant some lie they invent 

 be thou not ashamed of thy prince to speak ill 
thy own abuse do to excuse 
no marvel though the city have all man ill will 
when both in word and deed thyself thou do misuse 
sed Reginum est male audire cum besecerint 
Antisthenes do true this say recite 
it be give to prince say he though they be benevolent 
to be evil speak of which be against all right 

 sir you be best say no more than you be able to prove 
lest I make you to repent your boldness 
for if my patience you too much do move 
I may chance turn your heat into a coldness 
why I lend my money like a friend for good will 
and thereby do help man at their need 

 a friend thou be in deed though a friend but ill 
Pythagoras thy friendship have plain decree 
there be many say he who no friend do lack 
and yet of friendship they have but scant 
so thou be a friend for their money sake 
and yet thy friendship they always shall want 

 assure thou high offend 
for that so double in deal thou be 
Aristotle say by the same thou pretend 
and not so to bear a dissemble heart 
a christian ought not unto riches to yield 
for it be a thing but failable and vain 
riches be no perpetual shield 
but the shield of faith shall ever remain 
take therefore faith and god word for thy sword 
and arm Christianity in this wise 

 shall policy and riches then be abhor 
sir they be fool that they will despise 
I put case poverty shall i assail 
can god word and faith i any thing aid 
poverty against riches can never avail 
I be sure sir this may not be denay 

 we deny not but in this world riches bear the sway 
yet it not riches to be call sure 
for in God power it be to make riches decay 
whereas God word and faith shall ever endure 

 but give i riches take you god word and faith 
and see which of we shall have the better gain 

 now faithful few you here what he say 
therefore to turn the title I must be fain 

 well since it will no better be 
to God let we the cause betake 
who I trust whenas time he do see 
he will for we a deliverance make 

 come master wealthiness let we away 
what shall we here any long do 

 in deed I hold it best as you say 
therefore your saying I agree unto they two go out 

 sorry I be to see his estate 
now near he be to the fount of perdition 
God grant he repentance or it be too late 
that of his sin he may have remission 

 but alas he go the contrary way 
for of his covetousness he take no ruth 
and Aristotle I remember do say 
the covetous man can learn the truth 
wherèfore he can or will not know 
the way to reform i Christianity 
therefore from this place now I will go 
to pray unto God to show he the verity 
now faithful few adieu unto thou 
I will pray unto God for thy comfort and aid 
I beseech thou make like intercession for i 
and that my reformation be not long delay exiunt 

 doubt not thereof good Christianity 
my endeavour herein shall not be delay 
alas what be man not know the verity 
no man but a beast he may be say 
yet many there be which in the world do live 
who for Christian will needs account be 
though to all abomination themselves they do give 
and from no kind of vice be clear or free 
covetousness be account no sin 
usury be a science and art 
all way be good whereby we may win 
although it be to our neighbour smart 
whereby it appear from love we be free 
the word of the wise we nothing regard 
for without love no virtue can perfect be 
as Plato the wise have plain declare 
no good thing without love it be possible to do 
Seneca of that opinion have be 
then how many good thing do they now think you 
in who no love at all there be see 
they watch their time the simple to snare 
no time they forbear their pleasure to work 
God grant we therefore of they may beware 
for privy to snare we they daily do lurk 

 o more than wretch which so foolish haste spend 
not only thy own good but also other man 
what account shall I make for the good to i lend 
which never I be able for to recompense 
how wasteful have I with wantonness my wife 
consume our good substance and treasure 
that will to God I be out of my life 
for the remembrance thereof be grief without measure 
my wife and I now be asunder disperse 
each of we to seek our live alone 
alas our woe may not be rehearse 
unto who now shall we make our moan 
in take the time to towards we wear 
we be afeard to long to abide 
courage council in mind we do bear 
he say that for no man will tarry the tide 
but well away now which way shall I run 
I know it be folly unto God to call 
for God I know my petition will shun 
and into perdition I be now like to fall 
despair despair 
why shall I despair since God do behold 
the sinner with mercy as the scripture do say 

 but thy prodigal sin be so manifold 
that God of mercy do thou utter denay 
therefore to end thy life it be best 
thy calling for mercy be all but in vain 
by end thy life thou shall be at rest 
but if long thou live great shall be thy pain 

 well then will I seek some place where I may 
finish my life with cord or with knife 
the dispatch thereof I will not delay 
farewell now all the world but chief my wife fain a go out 

 soft stay a while and be not so rash 
think thou God unmerciful to be 
will thou trust despair even at the first dash 
have thou no faith in God mercy so free 
call upon god with repentance and faith 
by such way and mean as I will instruct thou 

 I believe God be merciful as the scripture say 

 well follow i and I will conduct thou 
o heavenly father pardon my offence 

 o heavenly father pardon my offence 

 and grant that thy mercy may to i repair 

 and grant that thy mercy may to i repair 

 also oh father banish thou hence 

 also oh father banish thou hence 

 that wicked monster of despair 

 that wicked monster of despair 

 how feel thou now thy conscience and mind 
hoy thou not of god mercy and grace 

 well God be praise that here I thou find 
how happy be I to approach this place 
despair be now flee I perfect know 
and in God mercy I firm do trust 
therefore oh lord deliver i from thrall 
and pardon i a sinner most vile and unjust 

 that be very well say if so thou do think 
and now frame thyself thy life to amend 
let despair no more into thy mind sink 
but to be a new man do thou now pretend 
and as heretofore thy mind for to please 
thou haste learned the tide will tarry no man 
so now it behoove for thy great ease 
that say after god will for to scan 
take time while time be thus I do mean 
amend thy life while here thou haste space 
to god merciful promise see that thou lean 
so shall thou enjoy the tide of his grace 

 to follow your council I will do my endeavour 
I will seek the same in all point to perform 
the effect of your word I will forget never 
and now I will hence my wife to reform 
that she and I in manner now 
may amend our life to god glory and praise 
wherefore good sir unto you adieu 
I beseech the lord to send thou good day exiunt 

 see how the time taker their fact do repent 
who no time will spare in please their will 
and although the beginning have a pleasant send 
yet of the end the taste be as ill 
for whoever it be that without measure 
do consume his substance in prodigal sort 
although he have abundance of treasure 
yet will he be a beggar and that in time short 
I marvel where authority be 
who shall see a help for the simple oppress 
many thing there be great amiss 
which by his mean must needs be redress 
his absence great disquiet my mind 
I will not cease seek until he I do find exiunt 

 out alas this tiding be ill 
my friend master greediness have end his day 
despair upon he have wrought his will 
and desperate now he be go his way 
as one enrage and out of his wit 
no remembrance of God he will have 
alas poor man he have a great fit 
before that well he be lay in his grave 
why but be greediness dead in good sadness reason with himself 
my think these news be not true which you tell 
yes true he die in a great madness 
and go with the tide boat straight into hell 
why fool greediness will never die 
so long as covetous people do live 
than you belike do think that I do lie 
I be as honest a man as any in your sleeve 
I be sure he be dead or one in his likeness 
for when he be bury I stand by 
and some say he die of the new sickness 
therefore sir think not that I do lie 
for I be as sorry for the death of the man 
as any man that live this day 
wherefore I must needs weep if I can 
but hush somebody be come this way 

 sure authority the same be even he 
I warrant you sir you need not to doubt 

 then will we handle he kind thou shall see 
therefore see that from we he escape not out 

 god save your honour and prosper your estate 
I be glad to see you approach this place 
those which say ill of you I utter do hate 
I answer for your honour in every case 

 ah crafty caitiff why dissemble thou so 
do thou think that we thou may so blind 
thy contagious doing we right well do know 
and eke thy property nature and kind 
thou be a encourager to all kind of vice 
the age to avarice and greedy desire 
the young sort lack none of thy advice 
to all such act as the devil do require 

 lo sir I think you do i mistake 
I know right well the man who you mean 
to fetch he heather good speed I will make 
I warrant you I will short be here again fain to go out 

 nay soft he be here who that we will have 
therefore you need not he for to fetch 

 yes I will fetch he for he be a very knave 
and alm it be that a rope he shall stretch still fain to go out 

 upon thyself just judgement thou do give 
Juvenal say city be well govern 
whereas such rebel be now suffer to live 
but after their desert be just punish 

 they which be rebel it behoove in deed 
that they be correct and punish so 
for they do much harm in every steed 
but I be none such I will you shall know 

 thou shall know what thou be or hence we depart 
faithful few upon he lay hold 

 by gis sir than I will cause he to smart 
therefore to touch i be not so bold 

 sir see where come correction also 

 draw near correction and thy office do 
take here this caitiff unto the jail 

 sir to do your commandment I will not fail 
come on sirrah and let we away 

 nay soft a while your wisdom stay 
hold i when you have i but you have i not yet 
and perchance ere you have i your nose I will slit 

 Think it thou with brag to make i afeard 

 you be best stand further lest I shave your beard 

 in faith sir now I will give you the check and catch he 

 o god passion will thou break my neck 
be there no man here that have a curse wife 
if he will in my stead he shall end his life 

 tush let we hence thy talk be in vain 

 sithence there be no remedy best be a short pain Exit 

 when all malefactor be due thus punish 
accord to the good and godly law 
then shall christianity due be burnish 
and to praise God we shall have cause 

 o faithful few doubt not but as we 
be able christianity estate to reform 
so his reformation in short time thou shall see 
for we for his estate do lament and mourn 
of ourselves we be not able to compass this thing 
but by this sword of God power which to we be lend 
wherefore faithful few have thou no doubt 
but we thereunto do glad consent 
for to Socrates say some respect we have 
who say a city be not to be praise 
for he greatness or building gorgeous and brave 
but for the good inhabitant which therein be place 
so we account those country but ill 
which vicious person do maintain and nourish 
although they have all thing at their will 
and although in treasure they abundant flourish 

 o noble authority by this your occasion 
great tranquillity to we shall befall 
we shall be a joy to each godly nation 
when Christianity be deliver from thrall 
for better it be unchristened to be 
than our christianity for to abuse 
the jewish infidel to God do more agree 
than such as Christianity do so misuse 
but see yonder where he do appear 
who abuse armour do great oppress 

 o Christianity unto we draw near 
that we thy abuse estate may redress 
and as free as this power unto we be lend 
here we now by force of the same 
to thou faithful few do here condiscent 
that thou christianities estate shall frame 
in such good form fashion and shape 
as the same shall not be turn again 
but shall continue in a godly rate 
from henceforth evermore to remain 

 god grant that so it may be keep 
as all Christian it may become 
and for my part it shall not be sleep 
but my duty shall straight way be do he turn the title 

 now God be praise who thus again 
have restore i to my former estate 
and have extinguish from i all pain 
God grant that now I be not find ungrate 
and God grant that all Christian may i due embrace 
in such sort as god will it be 
so shall they be sure of a rest place 
in heaven where reign all joy and bliss
