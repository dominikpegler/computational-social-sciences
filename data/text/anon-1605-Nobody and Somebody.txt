nobody then make dainty to be knight 
and indeed keep he in his know estate 

the slave ambitious and his life I hate 

how shall we bring his name in public scandal 

thus it shall be use my direction 
in court and country I be somebody 
and therefore apt and fit to be employ 
go thou in secret be a subtle knave 
and sow seditious slander through the land

deny the widow food the starve relief 
and when the wretch shall complain their wrong 
be call in question swear it be nobody 
rack rend raise prize 
buy up the best and choice commodity 
at the best hand then keep they till their prize 
be lift to their height and double rate 
and when the raiser of this dearth be seek 
though somebody do this protest and swear 
it be nobody fore judge and magistrate 
bring scandal on the rich raise mutinous lie 
upon the state and rumour in the court 
backbite and sow dissension among friend 
quarrel among neighbour and debate among stranger 
set man and wife at odds kindred at strife 
and when it come in question to clear we 
let every one protest and swear for one 
and so the blame will fall on nobody 
about it then if these thing well succeed 
you shall prevail and we applaud your speed 
see where he come I will withdraw and see 
the event and fortune of our last policy 

Come on my own servant some news some news what report have I in the country how be I talk on in the city and what fame bear I in the court

ask who they serve they will answer nobody 
your cavalier and swaggerer about the town 
that domineer in tavern swear and stare 
urge they upon some term they will turn their malice 
to i and say they will fight with nobody 
or if they fight and nobody by chance
