Were both advance upon a regal throne 
and have their temple wreathe with glitter gold

of horrid death these wreathe of gold bright flame 
that shall not only circle in their brow

I leave their fault respect unto the law 
give they as much as the other prison 
but what be he that with a downcast look 
give sign of discontentment 

madam I be a prisoner here 
but joy to see your grace at liberty 

that face and voice I oft have see and hear 
do not you sometime make abode in lee 

madam I do and those that know i call i guzzle 

then I be sure you know one mistress white 
this be the man that help i to escape 
when we be near beset with Bonner train 

it be my kinsman madam now I know he 
what cause have bring thou to this hard distress 

the cause even now allege 

have Bonner be so cruel to my friend 
before my eyelid wear the seal of sleep 
if heaven be please I will release thou guzzle 
and pay thy charge to the utmost farthing 
o my dear friend it never shall be say 
I be ungrateful where I be befriend 
and now his trouble make i call to mind 
the faithful deal of my servant fox 
see lord a man who I dismiss my service 
more through selfwill than any just offence 
yet have he quit that disgrace so well 
that I admire the strangeness of his art 
for Bonner use he as a special mean 
to seek my life which oftentimes he save 
pay my great unkindness with kind love 
many such servant may this land afford 
that use their wit to such good purpose 
here as a part of thy deserve reward 
I free give thou a hundred pound a year 
and when I die my land shall make it good 

and when fox fail you let he die in a ditch 

gramercy gentle servant now my lord 
let we bend our pace towards famous Londonbridge 
how please be the prospect of the city 
now I have be five year a stranger here 
through the same to Whitehall to her grace 
that I may see my love sovereign face
