our officer I fear neglect their charge 
our captain deal but cold with the state 

I dream my lord that Bertie and the duchess 
Were both advance upon a regal throne 
and have their temple wreathe with glitter gold 

that throne do I interpret be the stage 
of horrid death these wreathe of gold bright flame 
that shall not only circle in their brow 
but wind about their body till they waste 
and be convert to a heap of ash 
methinks this work of we go slow forward 
the air of England freeze for defect 
of burn meteor to keep it warm

in sundry place many person of several quality 
who name be tedious to relate
