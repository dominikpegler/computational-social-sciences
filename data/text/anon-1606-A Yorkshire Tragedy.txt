sue for his life number up all my friend 
to plead for pardon my dear husband life 

be it in man to wound so kind a creature 
I will ever praise a woman for thy sake 
I must return with grief my answer be set 
I shall bring news weigh heavy than the debt 
two brother one in bond lie overthrow 
this on a deadly execution
