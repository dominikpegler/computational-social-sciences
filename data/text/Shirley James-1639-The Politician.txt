it be a strange and sudden marriage 

can he not love she for the game and so forth 
but he must thus exalt she no less title 
than queen to satisfy her ambition 

it be a brave rise 

I do not prophesy 
when the honest count her husband Altomarus 
live she will bring we on our knee 

I hope 
she will love the king for it 

and in his absence 
Gotharus the king minion her old friend 
he have do this royal service beside what 
rest on account in her old husband day 
I do suspect her son Haraldus be 
get with more heat and blood than Altomarus 
age can assure she but he be dead 

be with he 
although I will make oath for her chastity 
that boy good nature be a argument 
to i Gotharus have no share in he 
he be honest of a gentle disposition 
and on my conscience do pray sometime 

no more we have a wolf by the ear what news 
from hell he can want intelligence he have 
so many friend there he be displease there be 
some goodness in that letter I will pawn 
my head that make he angry 
how his frown 
have scatter they like leaf they fly from he 
as nimble as their body have no more weight 
than their petition I will give a eyetooth 
to read but three line 

curse upon his victory 
I mean he not this safety when I wrought 
the king to send he forth to war but hope 
his active spirit will have meet some engine 
to have translate he to another world 
he be now upon return Exit 

will I have but 
the harrow of your skull my genius give i 
that paper be some good news of the prince 
I will I know it but concern he 

it be 
my wonder the king will send his son abroad 
to war the only pledge of his succession 

he have a councillor this politician 
that will prefer the prince to heaven a place 
his lordship have no hope to be acquaint with 
the prince and his great uncle duke Olaus 
will not allow these prank of state nor see 
the king betray to a concubine 
therefore it be think fit they shall be engage 
to foreign danger 
it be madam Albina 
our great man wife 

the king do seem to affect she 
before he marry she to his favourite 

do think she be honest 

I will not stake my soul on it 
but I believe she be too good for he 
although the king and she have private conference 

she look as she be discontent Exit Al 

she have cause 
in be Gotharus wife some say she love he 
most passionate 

it be her destiny 
she have he now and if she love he still 
it be not impossible she may be a martyr 
his proud and rugged nature will advance 
her patience to it 

avoid the gallery 

the king be come o my lord your pardon 

nay we must all obey 

I never like 
this fellow 

he be one of fortune minion 
the love of the choice lady of the laundry 
that be one that draw in the same team but more 
incline to the knave he be a kind of pendant 
to the king ear a everlasting parasite 
the king Albina return with he Exit 

leave we 
you be most unkind to yourself in my opinion 
you know well who I be and what I have 
advance you too neither in virgin state 
nor marriage to allow your king a favour 

sir let the humble duty of a subject 
who shall with zealous prayer solicit heaven 
for you and your fair queen 

have you be wise 
that may have be your title but the god 
of love have with his arrow so engrave 
Gotharus in your heart you have no language 
but what concern his praise scarce any think 
at liberty I do imagine when 
I have compassion of your suffering 
and give thou a fair bride to my Gotharus 
you will not lose the memory of my benefit 
but now in state and nature to reward it 
consent to return i love 

be please 
to excuse the boldness of one question 

be free Albina 

do not you love my husband 

there want no testimony beside the rest 
my give thou to he dear to my thought 
be argument I love he 

will you take 
i back again you but betray his faith 
and your own gift to tempt i to forsake he 

you be more apprehensive if you please 
he shall possess you still I but desire 
sometime a near and love conversation 
though he shall know it consider how much 
I may deserve he will be wise enough 
to love thou near the worse he be not the first 
lord that have purchase office by the free 
surrender of his wife to the king use 
it be frequent in all commonwealth to lend 
their playfellow to a friend 

o do not think 
Gotharus can be worth your love to be 
so most degenerate and lose to honour 
you have a queen to who your vow be sacred 
be just to she the blessing be yet warm 
pronounce by holy priest stain not a passion 
to wander from that beauty rich far 
than i let your soul meet and kiss each other 
that while you live the example of chaste love 
most glorious in a king and queen we may 
grow up in virtue by the spring of you 
till our topbough reach heaven 

you be resolve than 
we must be stranger shall my life depend 
on the possession of your bosom I 
shall languish and expire I see 

good heaven 
will not permit the king want so much goodness 
to think the enjoy of forbid pleasure 
can benefit his life rather let my 
ebb at some wound and wander with my blood 
by your command take from i on my knee 

rise I may kiss Albina 

ha enter Gotharus 

it have shoot 
another flame into i come you must 

what 

be a woman do it or I will complain 

to who 

thy husband 

horror 

think upon it Exit 

what will become of miserable Albina 
like a poor deer pursue to a steep precipice 
that overlook the sea by some fierce hound 
the just of a wild king do threaten here 
before i the neglect of he I love 
Gotharus my unkind lord like the wave 
and full as deaf affright i 

how now madam 
Come can you kiss 

kiss sir 

what difference 
between his touch and i now his perhaps 
be with more heat but i be soft enough 
what have he promise thou but that be no matter 
thou will be wise enough to make thy bargain 
I father all only the king shall give it 
a name he will make it master of a province 

what mean my lord 

thou think I be jealous now not I I know 
before he dote on thou and it be 
to be presume have a veil to hide 
thy blush I do mean our marriage 
thou may find out some time to meet and mingle 
story and limb it may be necessary 
and because I will be dutiful to the king 
we will converse no more abed I will be 
thy husband still Albina and wear my bud 
under my hair close like a prudent statesman 
but it be not much amiss as I advise 
before and these new premise consider 
you appear abroad with a less train your wardrobe 
will make you more suspect if it be 
too rich and some whole day to keep your chamber 
will make the king know where to find you certain 

will you have patience my lord to hear i 

the world do partly think thou honest too 
that will help much if you observe good rule 
and diet without tedious progress 
and visit of lady expert in 
night revel mask and twenty other torment 
to a estate your doctor must be leave too 
I will pay a fee to have your pulse 
feel and your hand roll up like wax by one 
who footcloth must attend while he make leg 
and every other morning come to tell 
your ladyship a story out of Aretine 
that can set you a longing for disease 
that he may cure you and your waitingwoman 
who curiosity will taste your glister 
commend the operation from her stomach 
shall you be sick and sick to death I will 
not counsel you to physic woman be 
frail thing and shall a cordial miscarry 
my conscience will be arraign and I 
may be suspect for your poisoner 
no no I thank you you be in a fine course 
to ease i wife or if you must be loose 
in the spring and fall let the king bear the charge 
he will if you apply yourself 

I be wretched 
why do you without hear thus condemn i 
the lady live not with a pure faith 
to she love lord than I have nor shall greatness 
nor death itself have power to break it 

Come 
these be but paint tear leave this have you 
prepare your last account 

they be ready sir 
never be lady slave thus like Albina 
a stipendiary worse a servile steward 
to give he a account of all my expense 

I will have it so in spite of custom heart 
while you be i accountless liberty 
be ruin of whole family now leave i exit Al 
we may talk more anon I have observe 
this privacy before search here Gotharus 
it be here from whence mutinous thought conspire 
with witty melancholy shall beget 
a strong bear mischief I will admit she be 
honest I love she not and if he tempt she 
to sin that be pay he back in his wife looseness 
from who I take my first ambition 
and must go on till we can sway the kingdom 
though we climb to it over many death I first 
practise at home my unkindness to Albina 
if she do love i must needs break her heart 

my honour lord 

most dear Haraldus welcome 
precious welcome to Gotharus heart 

the queen my mother sir will speak with you 

how excellent do those word become thou 
it be fit Haraldus mother be a queen 
thou be worth a princely fate I will attend she 

I will tell she so 

it be not a office for you 

it be my duty sir to wait upon 
my mother 

who in the court be not your servant 
you do not exercise command enough 
you be too gentle in your fortune sir 
and wear your greatness as you be not bear 
to be a prince 

my birth sure give i not 
that title I be bear with the condition 
to obey not govern 

do not wrong those star 
which early as you do salute the world 
design this glorious fate I do consult 
and in the happy minute of thy birth 
collect what be decree in heaven about thou 

those book be above my read but whatever 
my star determine of i it be but late 
I hear my mother say you be on earth 
to who I be most bind for what I be 

it be a shrewd truth if thou know all 

you have 
be more a father then a friend to we 

friend to thy mother I confess in private 
the other follow by a consequence aside 
a father my Haraldus I confess 
I be from thy nativity incline 
by a most strange and secret force of nature 
or sympathy to love thou like my own 
and let i tell thou though thy mother have 
merit enough to engage my sense 
yet there be something more in thou consider 
that raise my thought and study to advance 
thou to these pregnant hope of state methinks 
I see thou a king already 

good sir do not 
prompt i to that ambition I possess 
too much already and I can so please 
my mother travel where I shall not hear 
of these great title and it come now apt 
I shall entreat your lordship to assist i 
in a request to she I know she love you 
and will deny you nothing I will fain 
visit the university for study 
I do lose time methinks 

fie Haraldus 
and leave the court how you forget yourself 
study to be king 
I shall half repent my care 
if you permit these dull and phlegmatic 
thought to usurp they will stifle your whole reason 
catch at the sun divest he of his beam 
and in your eye wear his proud ray let day 
be when you smile and when your anger point 
shoot death in every frown covet a shade 
affect a solitude and book and forfeit 
so brave a expectation 

of what 

of Norway crown 

can there be any think 
within i so ambitious with what hope 
can it be cherish when I have no title 

I that have thus far study thy fortune 
may find a way 

the king 

be not immortal while he have physician 

what be that unsay the king be happy 
and the whole nation treasure up their hope 
in prince Turgesius who with his great uncle 
valiant Olaus 

be send to the war where it will concern they 
to think of fame and how to march to honour 
through death 

I dare not hear he 

or if they 
return 

they will be welcome to all good 
man heart and next the king none with more joy 
congratulate their safety than yourself 
I be confident my lord you will remember 
to see my mother and excuse i if 
to finish something else I have in charge 
I take my leave all good dwell with your lordship 

but that I have Marpisa faith I can 
suspect he not the issue of my blood 
he be too tame and honest at his year 
I be prodigious in love with greatness 
or if not i let he inherit but 
his mother soul she have pride enough and spirit 
to catch at flame his education 
have be too soft I must new form the boy 
into more vice and dare strange we must 
study at court how to corrupt our child 
the queen 

my expectation to speak 
with thou Gotharus be too painful to i 
I fear we be all undo do hear the news 
the prince be come back with victory 
our day will be overcast 

these eye will force 
a bright from those cloud be not you queen 

but how Turgesius and his bold uncle 
will look upon i 

let they stare out 
their eyeball be you mistress still of the 
king heart and let their gall spout in their stomach 
we will be secure 

thou be my fate 

I must confess 
I be trouble when I hear it first seem not 
you pale at their return but put on smile 
to grace their triumph now you have most need 
of woman art dissemble cunning 

my best Gotharus 

they shall find stratagem in peace more fatal 
than all the engine of the war what mischief 
will not Gotharus fly to to assure 
the fair Marpisa greatness and his own 
in be she a empire above the world 
there be a heaven in either eye that call 
my adoration such promethean fire 
as be I strike dead in my work shall thou 
but dart one look upon i it will quicken 
my cold dust and inform it with a soul 
more dare than the first 

still my resolve Gotharus 

let weak statesman think of conscience 
I be arm against a thousand sting and laugh at 
the tale of hell and other world we must 
possess our joy in this and know no other 
but what our fancy every minute shall 
create to please we 

this be harmony 
how dull be the king language I can dwell 
upon thy lip why shall not we engender 
at every sense 

now you put i in mind 
the pledge of both our hope and blood Haraldus 
be not well breed he talk too moral 
he must have other discipline and be fashion 
for our great aim upon he a crown never 
become a stoic pray let i commend 
some conversation to his youth 

he be thou enter Helga 

he shall be every way my own 

the king desire your presence madam 

I attend you will follow exit 

thou to death and triumph in 
my ruin for thy sake a thousand form 
throng in my brain that be the best which speed 
who look at crown must have no thought who bleed Exit 

this music do but add to melancholy 
I will hear no more 

he be strange move 

I can think a cause 
you be wont to fool he into mirth where be Helga 
your dear companion no device between you 
to raise his thought 

I be nothing without my fellow

without confederacy 

I will try alone

that for your unseasonable and saucy fool strike he 

that be a musical box of the ear

will you have your part 

Hormenus you may stay

it be possible 
I may fare the worse 

and wise can tell the cause why I be sad

nor I myself it be strange I shall be subject 
to a dull passion and no reason for it 

these thing be frequent 

sometime ominous 
and do portend 

if you enjoy a health 
what be in fate 

I be king 
still and I not 

we be all happy in it 
and when time shall with the consent of nature 
call you a old man from this world to heaven 
may he that shall succeed you prince Turgesius 
the glory of our hope be no less fortunate 

my son 
I be too rash to part with he 

we shall 
have think his stay a blessing and do wish 
you will not have expose such tender year 
to the rough war but your command meet with 
his duty and our obedience 

it be very 
strange we of late hear no success I hope 
this sadness be not for his loss he have 
a kinsman with he love he dear it be 
the queen enter queen and Helga 
I feel my droop thought fall off 
and my cloud fly before the wind her presence 
have a infusion to restore dead nature

all her delight in these fair eye and can not 
but think itself a exile in thy absence 
why shall we ever part but chain ourselves 
together thus

I do not think but his majesty will cuff well

I shall no more ask you a reason why 
you have be so kind to i and to my mother

that can not hide the action of a father 

I be your base seed then 

stain not thyself 
with such a name but look upon thy mother 
now make a queen 

you make she first a strumpet 
and it will ask the piety of her son 
to die upon that man that steal her honour 
why do you so undo we why do you 
betray my mother to this shame or when 
she have consent why shall both your lust 
curse my unsinning heart o I must be 
for your vice scorn though innocent 

None dare 

I shall not by your virtue have be save 
where shall I hide my life I must no more 
converse with man

I will entreat my mother we may go 
into some wilderness where we may find 
some creature that be spot like ourselves 
and live and die there be companion 
to the wild panther and the leopard yet 
they be too good for their converse we be 
by we defile their spot do make they fair 

it be time that Sueno and his companion

if the queen beauty keep her magic than 
our engine mount and day grow bright again

to injure i 

we all know you can plead 
your own defence you have a woman wit 
heaven send you equal modesty I be plain 

it will be hold a insolence in other 
and saucy boldness in the sacred presence 
thus of the king to accuse who he have please 
to take companion of his bed and though 
it will become the justice of my cause 
and honour to desire these black aspersion 
may be examine further and the author 
call to make proof of such a passionate language 
which will betray his accusation be 
but envy of my fortune I remember 
you be the king uncle and it be possible 
you may be abuse by some malicious tale 
frame to dishonour i and therefore I 
beseech you humble sir to let this pass

to the most violent man under the planet 
these soldier 

and they will cling to he like ivy 
embrace he even to death 

like breeze to cattle 
in summer they will not let he feed 

but make 
he fling unquiet 

most repineful spleeny 

ready to break the twist of his allegiance 

which they fret every day 

these put upon his young blood discontent 

dangerous 

extreme dangerous 

Swell he up 
with the allure shape of rule and empire 

and speak his strength with a proud emphasis 
you with a faint coldhearted voice be ever 
such peremptory line write to a father 

thy counsel while the danger yet aloof 

aloof take heed hill in a piece of landscape 
may seem to stand a hundred league yet measure 
there be but a inch in distance o ambition 
be a most cunning infinite dissembler 
but quick in the execution 

thy counsel 

he that aspire have no religion 
he know no kindred 

I ask for thy advice 

have you not see a great oak cleave asunder 
with a small wedge cut from the very heart 
of the same tree 

it fright i to apply it 
o my misfortune this be torment not 
a cure enter Aquinus 

Aquinus speak he gentle sir 
and leave i to encourage he in a service 
worth his attempt and needful to your safety 
noble Aquinus our good king have sense 
of the affront you suffer from his uncle 
and as he be inform for speak but 
the duty of a subject 

this be true sir 
I wear his bloody favour still I never 
take any blow so long on trust 

I know thy spirit be dare and it shall become 
my justice to reward thy suffering 
a storm now hover over my kingdom 
when the air be clear and our sky fair again 
expect nay challenge we shall recompense 
what thou have suffer for we with a bounty 
worth all thy merit in the mean time apply 
thyself to my Gotharus and be counsel Exit 

my duty 

thou have no alliance to my blood 
yet if thou think I do not flatter thou 
I feel a friendly touch of thy dishonour 
the blow it be not well do of duke Olaus 

you great man think you may do what you please 
and if you have a mind to pound we in a mortar 
we must obey 

that law be none of nature 
and this distinction of birth and royalty 
be not so firm a proof but there be man 
have sword to pierce it through and make the heart 
of those that take this privilege from their blood 
repent they be injurious 

my sword 
be quiet when he beat i 

he do not can not beat thou 

it be worse he cudgel i I feel it yet 
nor dare I strike again 

it can not be 
a tameness in thy spirit but quick thought 
that it be Olaus not that in thy heart 
there be no will to be revenge for he 
be false to nature love his injury 
but that there be no safety to return 
thy anger on his person 

you be in the right 
that fright i 

for he be not revenge 
that kill his enemy and destroy himself 
for do he own justice therefore man 
that be not slave but free these we receive 
bear and breed gentleman in fair employment 
that have and dare bid high again for honour 
when they be wrong by man above they in title 
as they be think worthy a personal wound 
in that be raise and level with the injurer 
and he that shall provoke i with his weapon 
by make i his enemy make i equal 
and on those term I kill he but there be 
another caution to wise man who ought 
to cast and make themselves secure that when 
they have return full payment for their suffering 
in fame they may be safe without a guard 

that sir be the prudence 

yet I can direct thou 
to be revenge with safety unto this 
what if I add therein thou shall do service 
that will oblige the commonwealth that groan 
with fear of innovation and make 
the king thy friend by one expense of courage 
and have name the king thus it must make 
thy thought secure from future loss and in 
the present act no danger 

sir be clear 
make good what you have promise 
and see if I be fright I have help 
many give up the ghost 

Olaus use 
thou base how much will the kingdom suffer 
if he be dead and lay into his tomb 
perhaps a year soon than nature mean 
to make his bone fit 

I dare kill he sir 
if I be sure the king will pardon i 
that in my own revenge and any other 
who he call enemy without exception 
to this I be bind in conscience sir there need 
no conjuration for this nor art 
to heighten i let i but hear the king 
will have it and secure i 

thou deserve he 
and may a statue for our great deliverer 
yet now I have think better on it we may 
save trouble in Olaus tragedy 
and kill he through another 

who 

one that 
sit heavy on the king heart and dwell in it 
such a disease as if no resolute hand 
cure he 

I will be his surgeon 

when I name he 
one that have have no will to advance thou 
to thy desert in war for all thy former 
and thy late service reward with 
a dull command of captain but incense 
by Olaus now who rule his heart less hope 
to be repair in fortune 

let he be the prince 

it be he 

it honour my attempt 
and while his father hold he disobedient 
I think he less than subject 

disobedient look there show a letter 

this be the prince hand 

but read his heart 

impious above the reach 
of common faith 
I be satisfy he must not live the way 
they will not trust i with his cup to poison it 
show i the way the king and queen 

let we study enter king and queen 

you have a faithful servant in Gotharus 

upon his wisdom we depend 

I have it 
he shall die like a soldier thus whisper 

their malice 
do only aim at i and if you please 
to give i up a sacrifice to their fury 

not for a thousand son my life and honour 
must sit with thy Marpisa

this act shall make thou great the king and queen 
look cheerful royal sir and think of honour 
to crown the merit of this captain let

we give our country be a crimson tear 
from our own heart they be a viperous brood 
gnaw through the bowel of their parent I

one heap of stone 

Gotharus on the wall
