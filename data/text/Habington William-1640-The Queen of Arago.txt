my lord let we change the subject love be wear 
so threadbare out of fashion and my faith 
so little lean to vow 

the rage of time 
or sickness first must ruin that bright fabric 
nature take pride to build 

I thank my youth then 
for the tender of your service it be the last 
good turn it do i but by this my fear 
instruct i when the old bald man call time 
come steal on i and shall steal away 
what you call beauty my neglect face 
must be enforce to go in quest for a new 
knight errant 

slander not my constant faith 
nor doubt the care fate have to stop the motion 
of envious time may it endanger so 
supreme a beauty 

sure my lord fate have 
more serious business or divine make bold 
to instruct we in a schism but grant I can 
induce myself which I despair I shall 
to hear and talk that empty nothing love 
be it now in season when a army lie 
before our city gate and every hour 
a battery expect dear my lord 
let we seal our testament and prepare for heaven 
and as I be inform by they who seem 
to know some part of the way love not the near 
path that lead thither 

madam he be but 
a coward lover who or death or hell 
can fright from we mistress and for danger now 
threaten the city how can I so arm 
myself as by your favour proof against 
all stratagem of war 

your lordship then 
shall walk as safe as if a Lapland witch 
you will not envy i the honour of 
the metaphor preserve you shotfree but 
who be your confessor yet spare his name 
his function will forgive the glory of it 
sure he be ill read in case to allow 
a marry lord the freedom of this courtship 

can you think madam that I trust my sin 
but virtue be those love I pay your beauty 
to the council of a cassock who have art 
to judge of my confession must have have 
at least a privy chamberer to his father 
we of the court commit not as the vulgar 
dull ignorant sin then that I be marry madam 
be rather safety to our love 

my heart 
how sick be I of the sudden good my lord 
call your dwarf hither 

Garaganta boy 

prithee thy pedigree 

madam what mean you 

o any thing but to divert from love 
another word of courtship and I swoon 

my ancestor be giant madam giant 
pure spanish who disdain to mingle with 
the blood of Goth or Moore their mighty action 
in a small letter nature print on 
your little servant 

how so very little 

by the decay of time and be force 
from fertile pasture to the barren hill 
of Biskay Even in tree you may observe 
the wonder which transplant to a soil 
less happy lose in groat be not the once 
huge body of the roman empire now 
a very pigmy 

but why change you not 
that so gigantic name of Brumfilldora 

spite of malignant nature I will preserve 
the memory of my forefather they shall live 
in i contract 

madam let we return 
to the love we last discourse on 

This my lord 
be much more serious what course thing be that 

I owe you sir for the pleasure of this walk 

madam it be to i the high honour 

Welcome o welcome to redeem i what 
can the best wit of woman fancy we 
have be discourse of 

sure not of love 

of that most ridiculous hobby horse love 
that fool that fool the world that spaniel love 
that fawn the more it be kick 

will you betray i 

thy lord have so protest Floriana 
vow such a altar to my beauty swear 
so many oath and such profane oath too 
to be religious in perform all 
that be impious towards heaven and to a lady 
most ruinous 

good Cleantha all your detraction 
win no belief on my suspicion 

be credulous and be abuse Floriana 
there be no vice so great as to think he virtuous 
go mount your milkwhite steed fit Lanceloi 
your little squire attend you there in suburb 
enchant castle be where lady wait 
to be deliver by your mighty hand 
go and protest there 

I thank your favour madam 

it be not so much worth sir come we will follow 

but stay Cleantha prithee what beget 
that squeamish look that scornful wry of the mouth 
when oniate part 

why thou have 
so strange a fellow in thy company 
his garb be so uncourtly I grow sick 

he be a gentleman and add to that 
make good the title 

haply he may so 
and haply he be enamour on thy beauty 

on my Cleantha 

yes dear Floriana 
yet neither danger to thy chastity 
nor blemish to thy fame custom approve it 
but I owe little to my memory 
if ere I see he among the great lady 
sure he be some suburb courtier 

he be noble 
and have a soul a thing be question much 
in most of the gay youth who you converse with 

but how disorderly his hair do hang 

yet it be his own 

how ill turn up his beard 
and for his clothes 

though not fresh every morning 
yet in the fashion 

yes in the sober fashion 
which courtier wear who hope to be employ 
and aim at business but he be not gentile 
not discompose enough to court a lady 

his thought be much more serious 

guard i fortune 
I will not have the court take notice that 
I walk one hour with that state aphorism 
each autumn to renew my youth let we 
discourse with lord who head and leg move more 
than do their tongue and to as good a sense 
who snatch from my hand a glove can sigh 
and print a kiss and then return it back 
who on my busk even with a pin can write 
the anagram of my name present it humble 
fall back and smile 

Cleantha I perceive 
there be small hope of thy conversion 
thou be resolve to live in this heresy 

yes since it be the religion of our sex 
sweet Floriana I will not yet suffer 
for unregarded truth court persecution enter Ossuna and Oniate with diverse soldier 
but what be they appear there 

we will away 

this be the place for interview you who be 
depute for this service from the lord 
Florentio use such caution as befit 
your charge however your general person safe 
the lord Decastro have pass his word 

yet it be my wonder that Florentio 
a soldier so exact practise in all 
the mystery of war and peace shall trust 
himself where the enemy faith must best secure he 

the great Decastro sir who our late king 
depute regent at his death and who 
the kingdom judge fit to marry with 
his only heir the present queen though she 
disdain his love and our desire have prove 
to time and fortune that he fear no danger 
but what may wound his honour how can then 
Florentio though he now set down before 
our city with so vast a army choose 
a place for interview by art and nature 
so fortify as where decastro faith 
make it impregnable 

distrust my lord 
be the best counselor to great design 
our confidence betray we but between 
these two be other seed of jealousy 
such as will almost force religion break 
her tie vow authorize perjury 
and make the scrupulous casuist say that faith 
be the fool virtue they both love the queen 
Decastro build on his high desert 
and vote of Arragon Florentio on 
the favour he gain from her majesty 
when here he live employ by his great master 
king of Castille 

such politic respect 
may warrant the bad statesman to dark action 
but both these general by a noble war 
resolve to try their fate 

but here my lord 
enter Sanmartino be a full period to all serious thought 
this lord be so impertinent yet still 
upon the whisper 

he be a mischief sir 
no court be safe from 

what fine trick he show 
each morning on his jennet but to gain 
a female vision from some halfopened window 
and if a lady smile by accident 
or but in scorn of he yet he kind soul 
interpret it as prophesy to some 
near favour to ensue at night 

I wonder 
what make he thought a wit 

a copper wit 
which fool let pass for currant so false coin 
such very alchemy that who vent he 
for aught but parcel ass may be in danger 
look on he and in little there see draw 
the picture of the youth be so admire 
of the spruce sir who lady and their woman 
call the fine gentleman 

what be those paper 
with such a sober brow he look upon 

nor platform nor intelligence but a prologue 
he come to whisper to one of the maid 
in the privy chamber after supper 

I praise the courage of his folly yet 
who fear can make wise 

my good lord 
brave oniate see you not the general 

he be upon entrance here and how my lord 
I see your lordship turn over paper 
what be the discovery 

it may import 
decastro knowledge never better language 
or neat wit a paper of such verse 
write by the exact hand 

in time of business 
as serious as our safety to intrude 
the dream of madman 

my judicious lord 
it with the favour of your lordship may 
concern the general such high rapture 
in admiration of the queen who he 
pretend to love how will her majesty 
smile on his suit when in the heat of business 
he not neglect this amorous way to woe she 

no man presume to advance a foot my lord 
Ossuna I desire your ear 

my lord 
I have a piece here of such elegant wit 

your pardon good my lord we le find a hour 
less serious to advise upon your paper 
and then at large we will whisper 

as you please 
my lord you will pardon the error of my duty 

the queen my lord give free access to what 
I speak of the public but when I begin 
to mention love 

how do she frown or with 
what murder scorn hear she Decastro name 
love of thy labyrinth of art what path 
leave I untrodden humble I have labour 
to win her favour and when that prevail not 
the kingdom in my quarrel vow to empty 
the vein of their great body 

sir she heart 
be mighty than misfortune though her youth 
soft as some consecrate virgin wax 
seem easy for impression yet her virtue 
hard as a rock of diamond break all 
the battery of the wave 

unkind and cruel 

she charge i tell you that a faith less moor 
who have gain honour only by the ruin 
of what we hold religious soon she 
will welcome to her bed than who to his queen 
and love have be a rebel 

how a rebel 
the people suffrage which inaugurate prince 
have warrant my action 

but she answer 
the subtle art of faction not free vote 
command her restraint 

May even those star 
who influence make i great turn their aspect 
to blood and ruin if ambition raise 
the appetite of love her beauty have 
a power more sovereign than the eastern slave 
acknowledge ever in his idol king 
to that I bow a subject but when I 
discover that her fancy fix upon 
Florentio general now of the enemy army 
I let the people use their severe way 
and they restrain she 

but my lord their guilt 
be make your crime yet all this new affliction 
disturb she not to anger but disdain 

she have a glorious spirit yet the world 
the envious world itself must justify 
that howsoever fortune yield up 
the sceptre to my power I do but kiss it 
and offer it again into her hand 

my lord the general of Castille Florentio 

he be safe welcome now let each man keep 
at a due distance I have here attend 
your lordship presence 

o my lord be we 
who love oblige to the same allegiance 
bring hither on these term 

the be term of honour 
and I yet never know to frame excuse 
where that beget the quarrel 

yet methinks 
we may have find another way to it 
we may have seek out danger where the proud 
insult moor profane our holy place 
the noise of war have be no trouble then 
but now too much it will fright the gentle ear 
of her we both be vow to serve 

that love 
which arm we both bear witness that I have 
much rather have encounter lightning than 
create the least distraction to her peace 
but since the vote of Arragon decree 
that my long service have the just claim 
to challenge her regard thus I must stand 
arm to make good the title 
this vain language 
scarce move my pity what desert can rise 
so high to merit she be each short moment 
of the long live commander lengthen to 
a age and that expose to danger mighty 
as coward frame they can you think his service 
may challenge her regard like the heavenly bounty 
she may distribute favour but it be sin 
to say our merit may pretend a title 

you talk sir like a courtier 

but my lord 
you will find a soldier in this arm which strengthen 
by such a cause may level mountain high 
as those the giant emblem of your thought 
pile up to have scale heaven 

that must be 
decide by the sword and if my lord 
our interview have no more sober end 
than a dispute so froward let we make 
the trumpet drown the noise 

you shall not want 
that music but before we yield up 
our reason unto fury I desire 
we may expostulate the ground of this 
so fatal war and bring you to that low 
obedience nature place you in 

my ear 
attend you 

where be then that humble zeal 
you owe a mistress if you can throw off 
that duty which you owe she as your queen 
what justice that fair rule of humane action 
can you pretend for take arm 

pray forward 

I will not deny for from a enemy 
I will not detract during her nonage when 
the public choice and her great father will 
enthrone you in the government you manage 
affair with prudence equal to the fame 
you gain and when your sword do fight her quarrel 
it be crown with victory 

I thank your memory 

but hence ambition and ingratitude 
draw only venom for by these great action 
you labour not to advance her state or honour 
but subtle wrought upon the people love 
a love beget by error follow still 
apparency not truth 

you construe fair 

the sun be not more visible when not 
one cloud wrinkle the brow of heaven for 
on that false strength you have in the multitude 
you swell to insolence dare court your queen 
boast your merit like some wanton tyrant 
in the vanity of a new conquest and 
when you perceive her judgement do instruct she 
to frown on the attempt profane against 
all law of love and majesty you make 
the people in your quarrel seize upon 
the sacred person of the fair queen 
story ere boast 

have you do my lord 

not yet this injury provoke my master 
to raise these mighty force for her rescue 
and name i general who aim be not 
a vain ambition but to advance her service 
ere we begin to punish take this offer 
restore the queen to liberty with each 
due circumstance that such a majesty 
may challenge free to make choice of who 
she shall advance to the honour of her bed 
if your desert bear that high rate you mention 
why shall you doubt your fortune on these term 
the king king of Castille may be induce 
to pardon the error of your ruin 

thus 
in short my answer how unlimited 
soever my power have be my reason and 
my love have circumscribe it true the queen 
stand now restrain but it be by the decree 
of the whole kingdom lest her error shall 
persuade she to some man less worthy 

how 

less worthy than myself for so they judge 
the proud subject to a foreign prince 
but when you mention love where be your blush 
what can you answer for the practise 
the queen affection when ambassador 
you lay here from Castille pretend only 
affair import both the kingdom nor 
can you my lord be tax by your discretion 
that by the humble art of love you labour 
to win so bright a beauty and a queen 
so potent your affection look not here 
without a eye upon your profit 

witness love 

no protestation if you will withdraw 
your force from our kingdom and permit 
they to our law and government that peace 
which have continue many age sacred 
stand firm between we but if not 

to arm 

pray stay my lord do not your lordship see 
the advantage I have in the place with how 
much ease I may secure my fortune from 
the great danger of your force 

ha 
it be inconsiderate in i but I trust 
to the honour of your word which you will not violate 

go safe off my lord and now be dumb 
all talk of peace we will parley in the drum 

come on you atlas of Arragon

I scorn that wealth make you thus wanton and

I will attend she here for here she give 
Decastro audience I must not lose

madam I wonder with what confidence 
you after such a injury dare endanger 
discourse with i 

I injure you my lord 
who favour I have court with more zeal 
than well my sex can warrant triumph not 
too much upon my weakness cause you have 
get victory over my heart take not delight 
to make my grief your sport 

be witty still 
and keep i for a trophy of your pride 
I hope to see that beauty at a ebb 
where will be then your overflow of servant 
you will then repent your pride 

o never never 
if you will particularize your vow to i 
you who to the title of the courtly lord 
have add that of valiant and beshrew i 
she be no good huswife of her fame that want 
a dare servant 

This perhaps may work 

if she live single he preserve her name 
and scarce admit a whisper that the jealous 
may construe point at she and if she marry 
he awe the husband if by chance or weakness 
she have offend 

this can be fiction 

then if she use but civil compliment 
to a courtier bachelor he straight be speak 
the licence and the favour and call in 
some wit into his council for the posy 
while I feel no tentation to such folly 
but with a marry lord 

how gentle madam 

our walk be privilege our whisper safe 
no fear of lay contract to my charge 
nor much of scandal and if there be cause 
who be so fond a gamester of his life 
as mere out of spleen to stake it but 
my lord I now suspect you construe ill 
that language I use to your lady when 
I tell she of your love but I presume 
you be not so dull sight as in that 
not to discern the best disguise for love 

what a suspicious ass be I how captious 
I never mistrust my own wit before 
mischief how dull be I 

pray turn your face 
away now know when worth and valour be 
lead on by love to win my favour but 
the queen 

Divine Cleantha noble lady 

Ossuna let i beg thy care though we 
brave repulse the enemy they seem 
to threaten a new assault 

command your servant

learn if they any new attempt prepare Exit Ossuna 
may it please your majesty command these many 
ear from your presence 

good my lord you who 
have power to guide your queen may make our presence 
or full or empty as you please 

then with 
your licence madam they may all with draw 

not with our licence if your usurp greatness 
will banish all attendance from our person 
I must remain alone but not a man 
stir hence with our good like 

if your will 
averse from sober council will submit 
to safe advice 

you have instruct it 
to more obedience than I guess my birth 
do ere intend but pray my lord teach i 
to know my fault and I will find amendment 
if not repentance for it 

then great madam 
I must acquaint you that the supreme law 
of prince be the people safety which 
you have infringe and draw thereby into 
the inward part of this great state a most 
contagious fever 

pray no metaphor 

you have invite war to interrupt 
with its rude noise the music of our peace 
a foreign enemy gather the fruit 
the sweat and labour of your subject plant 
in the cool shadow of the vine we prune 
he wanton lie down and rough bid 
the owner press the grape that with the juice 
his blood may swell up to lascivious heat 

my lord I answer not the effect of war 
but I must pay Castille all thankful service 
for his fair charity 

do you then madam 
reckon on mischief as a charity 

yes such a mischief as be merciful 
and I a queen oppress but how dare he 
who duty ought with reverence obey 
and not dispute the counsel of his princess 
question my action whence my lord spring this 
ill tutor privilege 

from the zeal I owe 
the honour of our nation over which 
king rule but at the courtesy of time 

you be too bold and I must tell your pride 
it swell to insolence for be your nature 
not hoodwink by your interest you will praise 
the virtue of his courage who take arm 
to a injure lady rescue 

it be ambition 
greedy to make advantage of that breach 
between you and your people arm Castille 
unpitied else you may have weep away 
the hour of your restraint 

poor err man 
can thy art raise a tempest black yet 
such as will fright thyself it can not for 
one moment cloud the splendour of my soul 
misfortune may benight the wicked she 
who know no guilt can sink beneath no fear 

your majesty mistake the humble aim 
of my address I come not to disturb 
the harmonious calm your soul enjoy may pleasure 
live there enthrone till you yourself shall woo 
death to enlarge it may felicity 
great as the idea of philosophy 
wait still on your delight May fate conspire 
to make you rich and envy 

pray my lord 
explain the riddle by the cadence of 
your language I can guess you have intent 
far gentle than your action 

if your ear 
great madam will convey into your heart 
the story of my love my love a flame 

leave off this history of love and flame 
and honest confess your fear my lord 
lest Castille shall correct you

And give my fine young general cause to wish 
he have not leave his amorous attempt 
on lady to assault our city 

but he be not wound 

not to death perhaps 
but certain we have open he a vein 
will cure the fever of his blood 

o stay 

torment and do she weep I may have fall 
down from some murder precipice to dust 
and miss the mercy of one tear though it 
will have redeem i back to life again 
accurse be that felicity that must 
depend on woman passion

art lose in the shade of death o let i find 
the holy vault where thy pale earth must lie 
there I will grow and wither 

this be strange 
my heart swell much too big to be keep in 

but if that providence which rule the world 
have to preserve the stock of virtue keep

and what if yet alive 
pray recollect your reason and consider 
my long and faithful service to your crown 
the fame of my progenitor and that 
devotion the whole kingdom bear i How 
have nature punish i that bring all 
the strength of argument to force your judgement 
I can move your love

with so much arrogance and tell a story 
so gallant for yourself as if I be

no madam humble far than the tan slave kneel 
tie to the oar I here throw down myself 
and all my victory dispose of i 
to death for what have life merit esteem 
what tie alas can I have to the world 
since you disdain my love

and ring we up each midnight to a masque 
in steed of matin and I stand prepare 
to be profess without probation

my grief but I will dissemble they yet why 
Cleantha be the sole beauteous idol

as dare attempt to marry i

thy eye but the sad world benight be 
or else their sonnet be apocryphal 
and when thou wake the lark salute the day 
break from the bright east of thy fair eye

poor drossy brain who can rhyme thy praise 
he woo in sorry prose 

half of the city

with moderation use their victory 
so far from draw blood the abstain from spoil

leave to my youth to think I may be praise 
and merit it hereafter when I shall 
owe art my beauty I shall grow perhaps 
suspicious there be small faith in poetry 

can thou think of hereafter poor Cleantha 
hereafter be that time thou be bind to pray 
against hereafter be that enemy 
that without mercy will destroy thy face 
and what be a lady then

Floriana

sorrow enough it be envy to ourselves 
to augment it by prediction 

see your lord

conduct by a unknown leader master 
the town Decastro yield up his fate 
to the prevail enemy be flee 

and shall the queen fly from her friend my lord 

you have reason madam I begin to find 
which way the gale of favour now will blow 
I will address to the most fortunate 

some music there my thought grow full of trouble 
I will recollect they 

may it please you madam 
to hear a song present i this morning 

play any thing 

cease the uncivil murmur of the drum 
nothing sound now but gentle such as may not 
disturb her quiet ear be you sure Lerma 
the obedient soldier have put up his sword 

the citizen and soldier gratulate 
each other as divide friend new meeting 
nor be there execution do but in pursuit 
of the enemy without the wall 

it be very well my lord be that your queen 

it be the queen sir 

temper like the orb 
which while we mortal weary life in battle 
move with perpetual harmony no fear 
eclipse the bright lustre of her cheek 
while we who infant be swath up in steel 
and in our cradle lull asleep by the cannon 
grow pale at danger 

I will acquaint her sir 
that you attend here 

not for a diamond 
big as our apennine she be heavenly fair 
and have not nature place she in a throne 
her beauty yet bear so much majesty 
it will have force the world to throw itself 
a captive at her foot but see she move 
I feel a flame within i which do burn 
too near my heart and it be the first that ever 
do scorch i there 

madam here be that brave soldier 
which reinforce the army of Castille 
his name as yet unknown 

and must be so 
nor do I merit name before this hour 
in which I serve your majesty enjoy 
the fortune of my sword your liberty 
and since your rebel subject have deny 
obedience here receive it from we stranger 

I know nor sir to who I owe the debt 
but find how much I stand oblige 

you owe it 
to your own virtue madam and that care 
heaven have to keep part of itself on earth 
unruin when I see the soldier fly 
send hither from Castille to force your rescue 
their general hurt almost to death I urge 
they with the memory of their former deed 
deed fame in war and so far have my voice 
speak your name power to confirm their spirit 
that they return with a brave fury and 
yield you up now your own humble Arragon 

my ignorance do still perplex i more 
and to owe thanks yet not to know to who 
nor how to express a gratitude will cloud 
the glory of your victory and make 
i miserable however 

I must penance 
my blood with absence for it boil too high aside 
when we have order your affair my name 
shall take a honour from your knowledge madam 

you have correct i sir we will expect 
the hour yourself shall name when we may serve 

I be conquer in my victory but I will try 
a new assault and overcome or die 

my lord it show a happy discipline 
where the obedient soldier yield respect 
to such severe command now when victory 
give licence to disorder 

sir our general 
the lord Florentio be a glorious master 
in the art of war and though time make he not 
wise at the expense of weakness or disease yet 
I have behold he by the easy motion 
but of his eye repress sedition 
when it contemn the frown of majesty 
for never he who by his prince smile 
stand great at court attain such love and awe 
with that fierce viper the repine people 

our kingdom owe its safety to that power 
for how deject look our magistrate 
when conquest give admittance to the soldier 
but how their fear for sooke they when they see 
you entry with such silence 

sir castile 
aim not at spoil or ruin in this war 
but to redress that insolence your queen 
do suffer under in Decostro pride 

and yet auxiliary oft turn their sword 
to ruin who they come to rescue 

the barbarous keep no faith in vow but we 
we of Castille though flatter advantage 
persuade to perjury have still observe 
friendship inviolate no nation suffer 
to which we give our oath 

you speak my lord 
your glory noble and it be our joy 
your general wound but fright we 

the surgeon 
affirm there be no danger and have licence 
his visit to the queen 

it be think however 
his love have not obey such a restraint 
though death have threaten he but in his health 
consist the common safety since those force 
Decastro in the morning do expect 
ere you the town assault be discover 
to which he flee expel the city 

sir 
we shall contemn and with ease break that army 
who general we have vanquish have win 
the city and your queen into our power 

save you my lord sir your most obedient 
and how like your good lordship the great act 
of the strange cavalier be not his conduct 
most happy for you in the late assault 

he happy supply the office of 
our general however your city have 
be we for though our spanish force may 
at first seem beat and we to retreat 
a while to animate a giddy enemy 
yet we recover by our art and patience 
what fortune give away this unknown leader 
I know not how to style he press among 
our soldier as they be return back 
after a small repulse encourage they 
though it be much superfluous and get honour 
perhaps not so deserve but it be well 

your soldier speak his glory even with wonder 

the ignorant be prone to it but sir 
I think in our whole army there fight none 
but who have equal spirit fortune may 
bestow success accord to her dotage 
I answer not for that 

this be pure Castille 
but what be his birth country quality 
and whether be he bind 

I seldom trouble 
my language with vain question some report 
it not import who be the author that 
his country Sicily his name Ascanio 
or else some sound like that that he be a lord 
but what be a island lord and that he come 
into our continent to learn man and manner 
and well he may for the allseeing sun 
behold no nation fierce in attempt 
more stay in council 

he be of a brave presence 
I never see more majesty in youth 
nor never such bold courage in a face 
so fashion to delight 

the queen commend he 
almost with wonder 

do the queen regard 
a man unknown 

his merit speak his worth 
and well may challenge a particular eye 

but he as if in that dumb oratory 
he hope to talk all the history of love 
still sixth upon she 

your most humble servant 

this be abrupt 

what most politic flea 
be get into his donship ear 

now must 
the junto sit till midnight till they rack 
some strange design from this intelligence 

nay on my honour madam 

good my lord 

benight we not so soon the short live day 
that give the russian in the winter hope 
of heat yet fail he not so sudden 
forsake the firmament stay fair madam 
that we may look on you and live 

my lord 
I fear you two be serious 

never I 
upon my conscience madam 

no I will swear 
nor none of the whole form of you at court 
unless the stratagem be for a mistress 
a fashion or some cheat match at tennis 

but happy that gentleman have business 
his face betray my judgement if he be 
not much in project 

you mistake he madam 
though he talk positive and bustle among 
the sober lord pretend to embassy 
and state design all day he be one of we 
at night he will play he will drink you guess the rest 
he will quarrel too then underhand compound 
why for a need he will jeer and speak profane 
court and then laugh at she he court madam 
forgive he his pretence to gravity 
and he be a absolute cavalier 

my lord 
he owe you for this fair certificate 
yet I fear your character be beyond his merit 

madam dissemble not so great a virtue 
nor to obey the tyranny of custom 
become the court fair hypocrite I know 
this vanity for fashion sake you wear 
and all those gaiety you seem to admire 
be but your laughter 

sir your charity 
abuse you extreme 

come you can 
disguise that wisdom which do glory in 
the beauteous mansion it inhabit madam 
this soul of i how course soever it be clothe 
take the honour to admire you soon as first 
you shine at court nor have a timorous silence 
so long deny i to profess my service 
but that I fear I may be lose in the crowd 
of your admirer 

nor can I perceive 
any strong hope now to the contrary 

nor I but give i licence to undeceive 
the world that so mistake you this young lord 
flatter his folly that indeed you be 
sick of that humour you but counterfeit 
believe you be frail and easy since if not 
his courtship be without design 

my lord 
what mean the gentleman he hope to talk i 
into a virtue I never practise yet 
and much suspect I never shall 

pray madam 
pardon his ignorance it be want of breed 

pardon your mirth fair madam and brush off 
this honour dust that soil your company 
this thing who nature careless obtrude 
upon the world to teach that pride and folly 
make titular greatness the envy but of fool 
the wise man pity 

sir your word be rude 

sure no my lord perhaps in time of yore 
they may be construe so when superstition 
worship each lord a idol now we find 
by sad experience that you be mere man 
if vice debauch you not to beast 

the place 
be privilege sir 

I know it be and therefore speak thus bold 
if you grow hot you have your grot my lord 
and in your villa you may domineer 
over the humble country gentleman who stand 
a loof and bare 

my lord leave off the combat 
you be hard match and see the lord Florentio enter Florentio and Velasco 
the queen attend his come sir will find 
a more convenient school to read this lecture 

but none so beautiful to hear i 

and be you sure my lord he dare presume 
to look up at she 

yes and she commend 
his person and his spirit 

it be too much 
to observe his person sure his spirit be great 
and well may challenge the queen memory 
I have not see he yet 

nor I my lord 

he have a fortune gentle far than i 
in envy of that service which I vow 
to Arragon heaven use a stranger arm 
in this great action I be judge a thing 
unfit for use 

your glory be the great 
your courage even oppose against your fate 
in the attempt 

but yet mistake man 
esteem the happy only valiant 
and if the queen Velasco shall smile on 
his merit and forget that love I have 
with such religion pay she but these doubt 
be impious and I sin if I but listen 
to their disloyal whisper and behold enter the queen Floriana Cleanitha etc 
she open like a rock of diamond 
to the curious search of the almost bankrupt merchant 
so do the pilot find his star when storm 
have even sink his bark divine madam 

welcome my lord but pardon i my joy 
if I must interrupt you with a sigh 
I can look upon Florentios arm 
but I must grieve it bleed for i

the treasure of those tear some captive king 
who fortune have lock up in iron want 
one such to buy his freedom madam all 
those stream of blood which flow to warm my earth 
lest it congeal to death can compare 
for value with the least drop shed for you 
by such a quarrel make inestimable 

the war I see have only be the field 
to exercise your fancy your discourse 
show that the court be keep beneath your tent 
yet can I my lord be jealous but 
it be mingle with some love 

it be a pure love 
unmixed as be the soul the world perhaps 
may judge a kingdom have enamour i 
and that your title dress you forth to raise 
my appetite up high pardon love 
if it grow envious even of your fortune 
and that I i foce to wish you have be daughter 
of some poor mountain cottager without 
all dowry but your own beauty then I may 
have show a flame untainted with ambition 
and court you but now the circumstance 
of greatness seem to challenge more than I 
have power to give and work up my love 
I serve my fortune

the trouble stream of my tempestuous state 
shall meet a perfect calm you then shall know 
how worthy I esteem your virtue

my marriage day I have vow to bring myself 
a free oblation to the holy altar 
not like a fearful debtor tender love 
to save my bond my lord I must not hear 
one whisper of a promise 

I be silent 
and use i as your vassal for a title 
more glorious I shall never covet but 

no jealousy my lord 

your majesty 
be great in mercy and I hope a stranger 
shall meet it if his speech be a offence

but let it not be sudden year shall sweat 
in preparation for his entertainment 
and poet rack invention till it reach 
such praise as will reach the victory 
of the old hero

a influence from your quarrel in the which

by which we will make it the envy of the age 

my lord what mean you 

what all fine lord mean 
who have plenty youth and title 

but my fame

will keep your council 

but will you not boast it 

I will be degrade first

may not a man take the height of thy lord spirit 
look on thou 

pray sir leave off your mirth 
and write my lord your answer 

little sir 
I never learn that pretty quality 
I can write only by word of mouth 

your place sir 

the market place

your weapon sir 

two english mastiff which 
be yet but whelp and not transport hither 
so that the time will be I know not when 

your sport be dangerous if my lord forgive you 
I must resent the affront as to myself 
and will expect a most severe account 

thou less thought angry thing than wasp farewell 

I be inform my lord that you have business 
and it be of moment 

great as that of nature 
in her most mighty work creation 
for to preserve from dissolution equal 
the gift of our first be not to hold 
your majesty in riddle it be to beg 
your pardon for a soldier doom to die 
inevitable doom unless your mercy 
step between he and death 

my lord we use 
to examine well the fact for which he be 
to suffer ere we pardon there be crime 
of that black quality which often make 
mercy seem cruel 

that be the fear which fright 
i to this paleness sure his crime be great 
but fond I presume on the service 
my fortune late do you give my vow 
never to forsake your ear with earnest prayer 
till you have grant 

will you have not vow 
for by the practice of my enemy 
my fame be among the people yet unsettle 
and my capacity for government 
hold much too feeble shall I then by this 
provoke they to disdain i I may run 
apparent hazard even of ruin now 
war so distract our kingdom but my lord 
your merit be too ponderous in the scale 
and all respect weigh light you have his pardon 

your hand on that the down on the swan bosom kiss and hold it 
not white and soft as this here be such a dew 
as drop from bounteous heaven in the morning 
to make the shadowy bank pregnant with violet 

my lord 

I kiss it and the phoenix seem 
the last of the whole race to yield a perfume 
more sweet than all his die ancestor 
breathe from their funeral pile o shrink not back 
my life be so concomitant with love 
that if you frown on either both expire 
and I must part for ever hence 

how strange appear this ecstasy my lord I fear 
your brain feel some disturbance if I cause it 
I will remove the object 

pardon madam 
the error of my fancy which oft seem 
to see thing absent if my tongue do utter 
what misbecome your ear and do not forfeit 
your servant to perpetual misery 
for want of a short patience 

no my lord 
I have the memory of your great deed 
engrave so deep no error can have power 
to raze they from a due respect you beg 
to have a pardon speak the offender name 

the offender name be love his crime high treason 
a plot how to surprise and wound your heart 
to this conspirator I have give harbour 
and vow to beg your mercy for he 

how 

and if you break your grant I will hereafter 
scorn all your sex since the most excellent 
be cruel and inconstant 

pray my lord 
go recollect your reason which your passion 
have too much scatter make i not have cause 
to hate who I will ever strive to honour 

madam you haply scorn the vulgar earth 
of which I stand compact and because 
I can add a splendour to my name 
reflective from a royal pedigree 
you interdict my language but be please 
to know the ash of my ancestor 
if intermingle in the tomb with king 
can hardly be distinguish the star shoot 
a equal influence on the open cottage 
where the poor shepherd child be rude nurse 
and on the cradle where the prince be rock 
with care and whisper 

and what hence infer you 

that no distinction be between man and man 
but as his virtue add to he a glory 
or vice cloud he 

but yet heaven have make 
subordination and degree of man 
and even religion do authorise we 
to rule and tell the subject it be a crime 
and shall meet death if he disdain obedience 

kind heaven make we all equal till rude strength 
or wicked policy usurp a power 
and for religion that exhort to obey 
only for its own ease 

I must not hear 
such insolence against majesty and yet 
this less offend than love 

if reason bend 
you not to mercy let my passion plead 
and not meet death from she in who fair quarrel 
I can each moment bring a life to the hazard 
philosophy have teach i that content 
life under the course thatch of labourer 
with much more quiet then where the fame hand 
of artist to the life have rich draw 
upon the roof the fiction of the god 
how happy then may I lengthen my life 
with some fair country girl so ignorant 
she know not her own beauty rather than 
endanger death and scorn in your denial 
and in your grant nothing but pomp and envy 

my lord be wise and study that best content 
this bold presumptuous love have cancel all 
the bond I owe your valour henceforth hope 
not for that usual favour I show stranger 
since you have thus abuse it will I may 
with safety have appear more grateful 

she be go as life from the delinquent when 
justice sheathe up her sword I fain will have 
conceal love treason but desire to obtain she 
put i to the torture till each nerve do crack 
and I confess then die upon the rack 

thy pride be such a flatterer of thy beauty 
that no man sigh by accident but thou 
do pity as enamour 

Floriana 
not so kind nature sure I have put 
the sigh of courtier in a scale and find 
some three score thousand may weigh down a feather 
I have try their tear which though of briny taste 
can only season the heart of fool not woman 
their vow be like their duel ever ground 
upon the idle quarrel 

This experience 
perhaps instruct you to but yet your pride 
I fear be over easy to believe 
it be mere to fly idleness that my lord 
have trouble you with courtship if the queen 
will make a statesman she may cure a lover 
want of employment make he dream on beauty 
and you come first to his fancy 

I begin 
to think his make love but vanity 
and a mistake in wit 

and you begin 
perhaps to fear it 

true perhaps I do 
for though we care not for the lover yet 
we love the passion though we scorn the offering 
we grieve to see it throw away and envy 
if consecrate to another woman 
have no revenge against the injury of custom 
which give man superiority but thus 
to fool he to subjection 

yet Cleantha 
I can have wish your charity have spare 
this triumph over my lord 

you see I take 
the next way to redeem he This the hour 
and this the place here he resolve to raise 
a trophy in my ruin and behold enter Sanmartino wind up his watch 
the just man of his promise not a minute 
he fail when sin be the payment 

I will endanger 
his virtue to a blush and happy 
convert a infidel 

this be my province 
nor shall you envy i the honour of 
a work of meritorious let he walk 
a while and sin with his own fancy then 
I will undertake he and if there be need 
be you prepare to assist i 

thou do build 
such fort on the opinion of thy wit 

it be a full hour and half a minute over 
and yet she not appear how we severe 
strict creditor in love stand on the minute 
but yet the payment never come unwelcome 
until the gold through age grow soul and rusty 
we stand not on a grain or two too light enter dwarf 
now your discovery 

my lord I have 
make search in every alley every arbour 
not leave a bush wherein my littleness 
can creep without due scrutiny and yet 
no whisper of taffety no dazzle 
of your bright mistress force i to a wink 
I see no mortal beauty 

sure she will not 
be so unworthy to delude i now 

but I have a more prosperous fate in love 
my lord I meet my mistress

a mistress to who beauty I have pay 
my vow most fervent vow ere since I be 
of stature fit to be a amourist 

one of the maid of honour to queen Mab 

your lordship guess near for she be one 
of the chamberer to her fairy majesty 
a lady of most subtle wit who while 
she put a handkerchief or gorget on 
her little highness hold intelligence 
abroad and order payment for the spy 
she raise faction and unite the angry 
she be much upon design 

where find you she 

walk alone under the shadow of 
a tulip and inveigh against court art 
because one of Oberon groom have get from she 
the monopoly of transport gnat 
a project she long aim at 

no more fool 
I be grow angry with my patience 
boy sing those verse be present i 
this morning 

I will creep behind a bush 
and then for voice vie with the nightingale 
if see I be so bashful 

take your way song without as the song end enter Cleantha veil 
she break forth like the morning in a cloud 
it be for the safety of my eye you veil 
the glory of your beauty which else may 
dazzle not catch the sight but I discern 
a fair Cleantha through this gloominess 
appear and speak bright madam why such silence 
o famish not my ear which greedy 
long to devour the music of your language 
be it to teach i that delight must be 
entomb in secrecy or else to show 
how mad a spendthrift I be to talk away 
the treasure of this hour Come fair unveil 

o give i leave yet to retain my blush 

deceit of timorous modesty traitor 
to love your blush be your fear be envious 
of your delight let we vanish hence and near 
to the vulgar eye again appear till we 
grow old in pleasure be transform to a vine 
or ivy so for ever to entwine

what privilege this attempt 

that tempt beauty

and to preserve your eye will it be wrinkle 
I can much easy suffer the reproach 
of age than your bold courtship if a lady 
be young and sportive use curiosity 
and perhaps art to help where nature seem 
imperfect in her work will you from the 
false argument of your own loose blood conclude 
her guilty or if she select a friend 
who innocence give warrant to her faith 
will you infer their whisper have no aim 
but that of brothel cause you find yourself 
nought but loose flesh will you turn heretic 
and thence deny the soul

more to the benefit but in your patent 
among all the privilege of a conde 
where find you lust insert without which 
till age have make you wise or impotent 
you think your honour be defective because 
your clothes be handsome and i too must we 
deform our mind be it sufficient motive 
to sin if opportunity and youth 
persuade we such as you be those foul plague 
infect the air which breathe our fame and make 
the cautious sir of the country shun we

of honour be here more than a groom may boast 
our maid be tire with yet this with a smile 
be whisper to your friend and you infer

not serve you to so fond a purpose if 
that courage you be fame for be no slander

to lose a eye there than your honour here 
if peace enamour you and the court live honest 
and hope the heir who shall succeed you may 
be you revenge destroy more chastity 
than all the tempt of such lord as you

this hour do promise i 

you will not commit 
a rape my lord

yet unresolved for force be my last refuge

little distract your conscience 

I propose 
Felicity which none can merit who 
refuse so poor a venture here I vow 
no prayer or art shall free you if you will 
hazard a life devote to your service 
I will die your martyr 

Come my lord I will free you 
from all such hazard

as will melt your soul into your lip and what 
be sweet no repentance shall be the issue enter Floriana and Oniate 
of your delight look here my lord she be you 

no halter now not tree convenient o 
a steeple will be precious for my purpose 
but Oniate be there I will fight with he

a challenge from i but return no answer 

my lord I have other business you will excuse i 

what satisfaction do man give when challenge 

accord to their spirit if they be 
regardless of their fame than they submit 
if not they fight 

what sir will you then do 

let i consider neither 

come you shall fight 

my lord I will not 

then you shall subscribe 
yourself a coward 

not for the whole world 
such a apparent lie will be a sin 
too heavy to my conscience I subscribe 
myself a coward if I shall no soldier 
will think but that my hand be counterfeit 

then you must fight 

my lord on no condition hope not for it 

then you shall swear never to speak my name 
but with respect 

hereafter if you can 
deserve it for the present I must crave 
your pardon with much mirth to laugh at you 

sir I shall meet you 

it shall contradict 
all my endeavour then 

I go sir but 

for mercy sake go with thy lord repentance 
may turn to desperation 

I will preserve he 

have you no business sir import you more 
than to hold discourse with i troth I shall pity 
you want employment 

madam what can be 
more serious 

nothing more if your design 
be to convert i for I know you hold 
all lady in a schism who be young and proud 

your pardon madam I believe in cunning 
court lady choose some petty venial error 
to set perfection off for shall you not 
usurp a handsome pride your fame will lie 
like unwall city open to the prey 
of each invade youth do you not show 
a scorn you will deserve it 

sir take heed 
hope not to win my favour by extol 
what in our better thought ourselves condemn 
I be so weary out with vow and oath 
with impious praise and most tedious flattery 
that nothing but plain speak truth can gain 
on my affection 

madam your affection 

pray sir do not comment upon the word 
it do portend no danger to you 

and if it do where be the beatitude 
for though I grant you virtue great as beauty 
can entertain and foolish I resolve 
to captivate my stock of life to a woman 
yet will I not adventure on you if 
you do not vow to perform article 

suppose the business come to article 

in the first than you shall covenant love not squint 
on every fine youth or great lord 
but look straight on i 

to the second sir 

no dotage on the court so far that my 
estate must rue it and no vanity 
be start up but my fond lady must 
be melancholy and take physic till 
she get into it 

why you envy then 
they our own trouble keep we from the expense 
and leave we to our discontent for penance 

no I will have the mind serene without 
all passion though a mask shall be present 
and you in the country I must have you wise 
to know your beauty mortal which you must 
preserve to warm my eye not aid by art 
to keep the courtier wit in exercise 
from his so practise flattery your care 
must turn with a brave scorn and when his eye 
do offer parley seem so ignorant 
as not to understand the language 

sir 
you haply will debar we our she friend too 

as secret enemy who will first betray you 

you will not allow we weary of our husband 
to send they on discovery of new world 
or if we take a toy ourselves to travel 
perhaps to Barbary or Tartary 
or the remote part 

to bedlam soon 

or if our sex shall warrant it by custom 
to play at tennis or run at the ring 
or any other martial exercise 
I fear i scrupulous sir you will condemn it 
as dangerous to my honour 

sure I shall 

I then perceive small hope of our agreement 

but I a confidence for I discern 
how much you loathe these folly you pretend 

good sir no more of this so kind mistake 
you will find some other lady more deserve it 
and I aspire not to the honour 

I will try yet far 

my lord you offer noble 

it be a step 
beneath florentio greatness whether you 
his birth consider or his place sir the queen 
by nature seat and her high desert 
where only mighty soul such as the general 
may offer to aspire 

my lord your lap 
to this proud language be so injurious that 
I must be force to purge the humour that 
the lord Florentio offer by a duel 
to show no man can have fair pretence 
to serve the queen must be allow but that 
you dare cast disregard upon this lord 
although a stranger urge i to entreat 
you will draw your sword 

it have see light and make 
way through a army when fond victory 
smile on our enemy it have do wonder 
when the thick troop of Moor invade we 
it fear no opposition 

show the effect of it 

not in a cause so trivial each small breath 
disturb the quiet of poor shallow water 
but wind must arm themselves ere the large sea 
be see to tremble pray your pardon sir 
I must not throw away my courage on 
a cause so trivial 

as you please my lord 
but to omit all circumstance you bring 
a challenge to my lord Ascanio 
the reason of the lord florentio anger 
a rivalship in love 

you speak it right 

I will bring you back his resolution 
before you have attend many minute 

sir it will be descent for my nature know 
not how to wait and if no delay 
be use it will show a fierce valour in he 
and happy prevent discovery 
for you may easy conjecture that 
a general absence soon will wake the eye 
of the suspicious soldier 

be my lord 
in readiness 

he walk not far from hence 

you shall have use then but of a short patience 

it will be grateful to we sir my lord 

and will Ascanio meet 

immediate 

I have no other way yet this be rough 
and justice whisper it be unsafe to tread it 
if to love she be sinful what be I 
How dare I call his passion to the bar 
and nourish it myself why may not he 
who have as bold a fortune entertain 
as bold a love and in the fate of war 
have outgo by service why not then 
present it to the selfsame altar but 
we can harbour both in the same port 
or he or I be shipwreck for the storm 
be raise and to appease it death must be 
the sacrifice 

my lord here be the second 
this stranger dare not meet with your great spirit 

suspect he not my lord he have a courage 
above the sense of fear well sir your answer 

my lord Ascanio can have wish his life 
may have be destine to a happy purpose 
And charge i tell your lordship that he have 
much rather have be lose with common dust 
in the cheap churchyard than endanger fame 
in this great duel 

sir explain his reason 

he call to his sad thought the mischief which 
this kingdom needs must fall into when you 
shall perish by his sword certain 
you can escape it thus provoke death 
then to what ruin may the queen who safety 
you both have labour be engage he can 
with patience almost suffer on his name 
the infamy of coward rather than 
hazard the quiet of her estate but you 

let i consider it be a idle rage 
that heat i to this quarrel let her fate 
remain unshake though she choose my foe 
into her love and bosom if she live 
above the fear of ruin I be mighty 
mighty enough though by my grief grow feeble 
and weaken too disease fright the healthy 
I will refer my cause and life to she 
and never dispute it by the sword 

my lord 

Velasco I be safe enough against 
the taint of coward Spain bear witness that 
I dare as far as honour dare give warrant 
but in this cause 

my lord you will lose the glory 
of all your former action and become 
the mirth of courtier empty thing who brawl 
not fight if you return after a challenge 
without performance 

it be a serious truth 

Moreover this young gentleman have hope 
to talk you from your resolution 
the lord Ascanio will too much exult 
if this way too he can overcome you 

it must not be sir tell my lord I wait 
his leisure 

and your lordship shall not have 
reason to think it long prepare yourself 
his only prayer be now that when he come 
there may be no discourse to take up time 
he have desire the business may be all 
what he can say have be by i deliver 

we will obey he tyrant love why be 
thy cruelty so wanton to delight 
in murder like that impious roman prince 
thou joy to smother who thou love in rose 
and stifle they with the choice perfume but 
this be no place for reason she may hold 
dispute in sober school where study raise 
the soul to knowledge here be the theater 
for the bruit part of man to fight his last 
I must redeem the laurel fortune crown 
his temple with or perish in the attempt 
my fate decree it 

here be my lord Ascanio 

why do he turn his face away as if 
he dare not look on danger do his fear 
now triumph over his courage 

put it to the trial 

he be more than mortal sure he strike like lightning 
himself not passive but I will try again 
and disenchant the sorcerer I there 
I reach he home you bleed open your doublet 
the wound perhaps be dangerous 

but a scratch 

sure I have hear that voice and see that face 
Velasco it be the king 

my lord what mean you 

some planet strike i dead and fix this arm 
a monument to tell posterity 
the treason of my error mighty sir 
show mercy to your creature that my death 
which hasty steal on i may not be 
too foul for after story 

rise Florentio 
this act can endure the name of treason 

some surgeon quick to search the wound o sir 
how do you feel yourself speak life or I 
shall sink down to my centre 

not a man 
stir hence thy sword be loyal as thy thought 
and scarce have pierce the skin o my Florentio 

my lord and king but why do you engage 
your sacred person into danger it be not well 
how many thousand life depend on you 

envy of the greatness I possess without 
the merit and desire to know those peril 
we wanton our subject cast upon 
on every weak exception wrought my youth 
into this action nor can I repent 
the experience of this waire 

but o great sir 
why do your majesty suffer this duel 
it be cruel and unkind how easy 
this hand may have commit sacrilege 
the very thought whereof like some pale vision 
congeal my blood 

search not that wound too deep 
Florentio I shall blush blush like some lady 
surprise in sin if you too far examine 

conceal it not great sir though in the speak 
poison steal through my ear be confident 
unveil your thought 

you needs must hate i then 
and will have justice to throw off that duty 
you owe i as a subject let it be 
unspeak still though smother it be death 
good heaven descend what be a army of we 
expose to certain slaughter if compare 
to the short moment that shall serve your quiet 
and shall I live and see my sovereign wear 
a sorrow on his brow 

Florentio thou 
be glorious in thy virtue So be I 
till look on the queen I grow of the sudden 
dark than midnight 

o my cruel fate 

I grow a thief a most ungrateful thief 
in my design and labour to have steal 
the jewel of thy life from thou a jewel 
myself so free have bestow upon 
the merit of thy youth 

my soul foresee this 

how just have I perish by thy sword 
how happy for my safety then have I 
be lose in my disguise or die my crime 
unknown unto the world now if I live 
I must wade through a sea of injury 
to attain a unsafe haven 

cheer yourself 
dread sir though as I give the legacy 
I breathe my last yet will I show a heart 
thankful to your great favour madam here 
behold the sovereign of Castille 

you have 
be cruel in your kindness sir to keep 
so long your sacred person hide from we 

he be your lover madam and deserve 
the title whether you observe his youth 
so beauteous nature dote upon her work 
or weigh his greatness powerful to defend you 
shall fate and all mankind conspire your ruin 
and add to that he merit you his sword 
have restore you freedom when poor I 
be judge like some old instrument of war 
unfit for service all my interest 
I here resign to the author of my fate 
my love I can which must still remain 
companion to my life but I will take heed 
my wound appear not though it inward bleed 

I wait here madam and attend your sentence 
for it be my doom 

sir I be that sad wretch 
stand tremble at the bar I know your merit 
and know a gratitude great as ere be owe 
by a injure soul relieve I due weigh 
that double tie which do oblige i you 
first when you send your soldier to my rescue 
then by expose your most sacred person 
to the danger of a war 

a trivial nothing 

what honour can come equal to my state 
as by so high a match and against your person 
the envious can find a quarrel 

madam 
all this be circumstance the politic 
busy their fancy with I bring a love 
a humble love which be of value to 
ennoble the parch labourer and force 
a empress listen to his vow Consider 
in i nothing of fortune only look 
on that to which love new create i 
if once receive your servant what be Castille 
in the comparison for prince be 
too bold if they bring wealth and victory 
to enter competition with those treasure 
a lover aim at in his mistress favour 
may I not hope your smile 

you must command it 

then give i leave to whisper to my hope 
what strange felicity I shall enjoy 

but sir consider how you give away 
to your Florentio all that claim you may 
have to i as so great a neighbour prince 

it be a gift my ignorance make which I 
be cozen in for have my eye be honour 
with sight of such a beauty safe he 
may have petition for my sceptre and 
the grant have not so soon beget repentance 

but promise of prince must not be 
by after art evade who dare punish 
the breach of oath in subject and yet slight 
the faith he have make they 

but my Florentio 
have give i back his interest 

that gift 
be like a vow extort which religion 
cancel as force from conscience 

but yourself 
be free and never by a oath make his 

my resolution ground on his service 
tie more than formal contract 

I will not urge 
you father but by these which never yet 
find passage through my eye not he nor all 
mankind contract to one heart can harbour 
a love that equal that I burn with madam 
think on it and let your thought find out that path 
which lead to mercy 

how I be dazzle 
place on a precipice by tyrant love 
the king be noble and his merit claim 
a retribution great as I can make 
he love i and yield only to Florentio 
in the priority of service my sad soul enter Florentio look on the queen sigh and go in again 
between these two I may stand distract 
but virtue guide i nor can I ere stray 
while that direct and honour beat the way 

my fortune yet forsake i not there be something 
whisper my soul that though a storm do cloud 
my morning I shall set the envy of 
my yet prevail enemy have you 
my fellow soldier not be three hour march 
from aid we when the castilian army 
make the assault we have give their fate a check 
and teach they how unsafe it be to court 
danger abroad I must entreat your courage 
to suffer for some moment a short time 
will bring we the queen answer if she yield 
as reason may persuade she we shall spare 
much loss of blood if not your valour will 
have liberty to show itself yet still 
remember that the city force to obey 
a stranger in their vote they fight for we 
do not man see the lord Ossuna since 
our fight in the morning 

he appear not since 
we leave the city to the enemy 
which have breed jealousy my lord that he 
change with the present fortune 

doubt he not 
he have a heart devote to the greatness 
and safety of his country well he may 
be lose in the number of the slay but fate 
can enforce he stoop beneath the vow 
of rescue Arragon from foreign arm enter two common soldier hale Ossuna in as a hermit 
what insolence be this unhand the man 
methinks his habit shall beget respect 

my lord we guess he be some spy he come 
skulk from the enemy camp pray guard 
your person mischief often lurk in shape 
as holly 

I allow your care and thank it 
leave he to i and for a while retire

how happy to the fortune of this war 
art thou restore I shall have fight unarm

How be my friend preserve 

by virtue of 
this sacred habit in the mist of war 
disguise I thus escape though close pursue 
by some of the queen faction to this weed 
I owe my safety 

quick throw it off 
and reinvest thy body in that steel 
with which thou still have triumph o my lord 
how oft have we all bathe in blood and sweat 
though cloud of dust find out the way to force 
back victory to our side when fortune seem 
to dote on the enemy we two have grow 
like cedar up together and make all 
seem shrub to we no man sleep secure 
but in our shadow 

yes we have be happy 

thou speak so hollow as there be a doubt 
we may not be so still 

but there be be no faith 
in humane fate a emperor do serve 
as footstool to the conqueror and be we 
better assure of destiny 

what strange 
unworthy faintness weaken his great soul 
who heretofore near understand the language 
danger speak in have one defeat lose you 
that mighty courage which have fix upon 
your name a glorious memory reassume 
yourself my lord let no degenerate fear 
benight the luster of your former act 

I call yourself and Arragon to witness 
my life have yet be such you reverend shade 
of my great ancestor need not look pale 
or blush to know my story to yourself 
to who brave youth I tie my youth a servant 
I ever have perform all office 
due to so brave a friendship 

it be confess 

and here I vow set aside those fear 
distract i as a christian I can smile 
smile like some wanton mistress upon death 
whatever shape it wear 

my lord this war 
be warrant by casuist for lawful 
but they you will say flatter the present state 
and make divinity serve humane end 
but in itself it be just a war your judgement 
give approbation to and urge i first 
to undertake therefore make good your own 
and throw off this unuseful habit 

never 

what say my friend 

by all thing sacred never 
in this I will grow old and with the weight 
of year bend to the earth in this I will breathe 
a happy air than you in all your soft 
and vary silk 

some coward devil sure 
possess he 

my lord I be instruct 
to a patience far above your injury 
nor shall your scorn or anger triumph over 
my resolution I be fix here unmoved 
as be the centre 

I be much to blame 
this may be a brave virtue pray my lord 
give i your reason why you tread this path 
so little beat by the foot of courtier 
I will not have the world mistake your aim 
and construe it to fear or melancholy 

that can shake i he who by the card 
of the world opinion steer his course shall harbour 
in no safe port but to your care my lord 
I give this free account seven winter past 
when I set sail from Sicily a storm 
over take the ship so powerful that the pilot 
give up the stern to the order of the wave 
his art and hand grow useless those kind star 
the sailor use to invoke be lose in the tempest 
and nothing but a night not to be see 
be see by we when every one begin 
to advance himself towards death as man condemn 
to the axe when hope of pardon be shut out 
I spite of the envious cloud look up to heaven 
and dart my faith thither vow to 
forsake the flatter pomp and business of 
the faithless world if I with safety may 
attain the land 

be not I there my lord 

you be 

And make no I the self same vow 

heaven have record that we both do vow it 
of the sudden night forsake we and the loud 
unruly wind flee to their unknown dwelling 
when a soft breath begin whisper to our sail 
a calm be to ensue 

my memory 
afflict i much but these be feeble vow 
make only by our fear we ought to have 
our reason undismayed when ere a promise 
can force performance 

I dispute it not 
soon as I reach the shore I court on 
those vanity which have my youth enamour 
yet still with some remorse honour betray i 
into a glorious trouble and I grow 
proud of my burden but if heaven have be 
severe to my delay in this disease 
surfeit of pomp my soul may have be call 
to her last account and oh my lord where then 
have breach of vow be safe 

these be sad thought 

but necessary when the morning loss 
make i search out a shape for flight this habit 
itself present and again redeem i 
and know I be resolve never to forsake it 
till in the vault my earth and it together 
shall wear away to dust 

my lord you have 
good title to your virtue pray retire 
into my tent this sudden change if know 
may much amaze the soldier and endanger 
the glory of the attempt I shall entreat 
your prayer since you deny your arm 

my lord may heaven direct you 

what have I obtain 
by all this sweat of business like the wind 
prosperous ambition only swell my sail 
to give i courage to encounter with 
a tempest early care and midnight fright 
faint hope and causeless fear successive 
like billow have move in i what a fool 
be humane wisdom what a beggar wealth 
how scorn he nothing that proud state we dote on 
time laugh we out of greatness and shut up 
our wide design in a dark narrow room 
whence when the valiant monarch shall creep forth 
he will like some poor coward hide his eye 
and hope to skulk away but these be thought 
and now it be time for action 

if your lordship 
will please for some few moment to retire 
into your tent her majesty in person 
will give you parley here 

in person sir 
the favour bear some omen she who in 
the tempest of misfortune still do spread 
her sail at large why do she strike they now 
the wind so prosperous this be a descent 
beneath her greatness 

I reach not my lord 
the mystery of prince but this message 
she charge i to return 

the act of prince 
be govern often by as frail a passion 
as those be of the vulgar the same rage 
that stir two footman to a fray create 
war between kingdom but the zealous subject 
gaze afar on the action of the proud 
find tower and lion in a empty cloud 
but I will obey her leisure watch you here 
till you discover she advance this way 

sir you create i and raise i up 
to the state of duke when I be common dust 
and have not fortune give i interest 
in the favour of the queen I have continue 
in the worst fate of man ingratitude 
now I can boast I have restore you back 
a love rich as the bounty you shower on i 
it be all the stock of my poor life 

sad fate 
that I must wound thou to the heart to cure 
my leprosy with thy blood Florentio search 
in the stock of woman there be some other beauty 

o no no other 

I will endow she with 
the wealth of all Castille 

poor empty nothing 

if sovereignty be the idol of thy soul 
I will divide my kingdom thou shall reign 
as independent as myself 

great sir 
continue but your favour and my star 
can afford a greatness equal it 
the treasure of the ambitious be the scorn 
of those who serious contemplate life 
my fortune high enough and now my thought 
grow temperate not for the empire of the east 
which yet retain the treasure man enjoy 
ere he grow black with sin will I have want 
this bless occasion to express the zeal 
I owe my prince here with as free a soul 
I give she to your arm as ere you throw 
a smile upon my service 

thank dear friend

possess i of the fair 

o 

the fair nature ere make for wonder

enjoy she thy king shall live who else 
be desperate beyond cure he shall be envy 
and every year as age threaten decay 
he shall regain new life from she Florentio 
believe it there be miracle in such a beauty 

sure there be enter queen Sanmar Oniate Cleantha Floriana 
and see she appear how like some heavenly vision 
that kill with too much glory 

stand still and wonder with i 

Cleantha o the prodigy and how 
will thou endure his serious face can thou 
who nothing tempt but wit parcel guilt 
and the last fashion suffer oniate 

madam I undertake he for a penance 
perhaps he be enjoin i 

it be love 
you go to shrift with then and yet how that 
young wanton idleness shall counsel you 
to this conversion still be more my riddle 

the court be full of wonder madam and 
it be handsome to do thing extravagant 

but how in the heat of war your thought shall be 
so apt for love impression 

love will dance 
as nimble to the trumpet fife or drum 
as to those many violin which play 
so loud at court Moreover it concern 
my safety I so straight be besiege 
and by so strong a Caesar 

o my lord 
I be inform with how fierce a spirit 
you do assault our lady 

pray your mercy 
and if your majesty will please to banish 
the art of make love quite from the court 
I will not be out of fashion 

for your sake 
I will contrive it so and good my lord 
will you begin the example you will see 
how soon the fine young lord will follow you 
your pardon sir have I but see your highness 
I have not lose so much of language from 
a most expressive gratitude 

madam you pay a trivial debt with too great interest 
for how contemn a slightness be my life 
until employ to serve you 

she glance this way 
and love artillery play from her eye 
unhappy bankrupt what a kingdom have 
I forfeit so often in a calm 
some vessel rich in fraught and proud in sail 
do spring a sudden leak and sink for ever 

but madam be there hope your heart can yield 
to a exchange in love my title be good 
Florentio have give up his claim 

but sir the estate be still my own nor have 
I need to sell it but decastro here 
and if your majesty will deign your presence 
unto the parley it will advance the honour 
and purpose of our meeting 

I be your servant 

my lord you see how near the safety of 
our subject touch we we can stoop thus 
beneath our majesty and enter parley 
even with a rebel 

madam it be in vain 
to hold dispute against what you will condemn 
and it be insolence to boast my power 
or speak my right now when the heart of all man 
confirm the justice of my take arm 
cast but your eye on this vast body which 
the kingdom do unite in my defence 
and see how ruinous be your error that 
must lean to foreign succour 

it be a refuge 
your practice force i to 

but will your highness 
have lend a gentle ear the safe counsel 
of he who have no crime but too much love 

my lord that word fall rude from your tongue 
and I may say unmannerly it be duty 
you owe the queen 

right sir a humble duty 
ambitious to expose my life to danger
