I tell you true sir but to every man 
I will not be so lavish of my speech 
only to you my dear and private friend 
although my wife in every eye be hold 
of beauty and of grace sufficient 
of honest birth and good behaviour 
able to win the strong thought to she 
yet in my mind I hold she the most hate 
and loathe object that the world can yield 

o m Arthur bear a better thought 
of your chaste wife who modesty have win 
the good opinion and report of all 
by heaven you wrong her beauty she be fair 

not in my eye 

o you be cloy with dainty m Arthur 
and too much sweetness glut have your taste 
and make you loathe they at the first 
you do admire her beauty praise her face 
be proud to have she follow at your heel 
through the broad street when all censure tongue 
find themselves busy as she pass along 
to extol she in the hear of you both 
tell i I pray you and dissemble not 
have you not in the time of your first love 
hug such new popular and vulgar talk 
and glorify still to see she brave deck 
but now a kind of loathe have quite change 
your shape of love into a form of hate 
but on what reason ground you this hate 

my reason be my mind my ground my will 
I will not love she if you ask i why 
I can love she let that answer you 

be judge all eye her face deserve it not 
then on what root grow this high branch of hate 
be she not loyal constant love chaste 
obedient apt to please loath to displease 
careful to live chary of her good name 
and jealous of your reputation 
be she not virtuous wise religious 
how shall you wrong she to deny all this 
good m Arthur let i argue with you 

o m Anselm grow a lover fie 
what may she be on who your hope rely 

what fool they be that seem most wise in love 
how wise they be that be but fool in love 
before I be a lover I have reason 
to judge of matter censure of all sort 
nay I have wit to call a lover fool 
and look into his folly with bright eye 
but now intrude love dwell in my brain 
and frantical have shoulder reason thence 
I be not old and yet alas I dote 
I have not lose my sight and yet be blind 
no bondman yet have lose my liberty 
no natural fool and yet I want my wit 
what be I then let i define myself 
a dotard young a blind man that can see 
a witty fool a bondman that be free 

good age youth blind seer and wise fool 
lose your free bond and set your thought to school 

it be tell i m Lusam that my son 
and your chaste daughter who we match together 
wrangle and fall at odds and brawl and chide 

nay I think so I never look for better 
this it be to marry child when they be young 
I say as much at first that such young brat 
will agree together even like dog and cat 

nay pray you m Lusam say not so 
there be great hope though they be match but young 
their virtue will have make then sympathize 
and live together like two quiet saint 

you say true there be great hope indeed 
they will have live like saint but where be the fault 

if fame be true the most fault be in my son 

you say true m Arthur it be so indeed 

nay sir I do not altogether excuse 
your daughter many lay the blame on she 

ha say you so bithmasse it be like enough 
for from her childhood she have be a shrew 

a shrew you wrong she all the town admire she 
for mildness chasteness and humility 

fore God you say well she be so indeed 
the city do admire she for these virtue 

o sir you praise your child too palpable 
she be mild and chaste but not admire so much 

I so I say I do not mean admire 

yes if a man do well consider she 
your daughter be the wonder of her sex 

be you advise of that I can tell 
what it be you call the wonder of her sex 
but she be be she I indeed she be 

what be she 

Even what you will you know best what she be 

yond be her husband let we leave this walk 
how full be bad thought of suspicion 
I love but loathe myself for love so 
yet can change my disposition 

Medice cure teipsum 

hei mihi quod mellis amor est medicabilis herbis 

all your persuasion be to no effect 
never allege her virtue nor her beauty 
my settle unkindness have beget 
a resolution to be unkind still 
my range pleasure love variety 

o too unkind unto so kind a wife 
too virtueless to one so virtuous 
and too unchaste unto so chaste a matron 

but soft sir see where my two father be 
busy talk let we shrink aside 
for if they see i they be bend to chide 

I think it be best to go straight to the house 
and make they friend again what think you sir 

I think so too 

now I remember too that be not so good 
for diverse reason I think best stay here 
and leave they to their wrangle what think you 

I think so too 

nay we will go that be certain 

i it be best it be best in sooth there be no way but to go 

yet if our go shall breed more unrest 
more discord more dissension more debate 
more wrangle where there be enough already 
it be better stay then go 

fore God it be true 
our go may perhaps breed more debate 
and then we may too late wish we have stay 
and therefore if you will be rule by i 
we will not go that be flat nay if we love 
our credit or our quiet let we not go 

but if we love their credit or their quiet we must go 
and reconcile they to their former love 
where there be strife betwixt a man and wife it be hell 
and mutual love may be compare to heaven 
for then their soul and spirit be at peace 
Come m Lusam now it be dinner time 
when we have dine the first work we will make 
be to decide their jar for pity sake

all mirth be force that she can make with i 

o misconceit how bitter be thy taste 
sweet m Arthur mistress Arthur too 
let i entreat you reconcile these jar 
odious to heaven and most abhor of man 

you be a strange sir but by your word 
you do appear a honest gentleman 
if you profess to be my husband friend

with all indifference in these discontent 
sweet husband if I be not fair enough 
to please your eye range where you list abroad 
only at come home speak i but fair 
if you delight to change change when you please 
so that you will not change your love to i 
if you delight to see i drudge and toil 
I will be your drudge because it be your delight 
or if you think i unworthy of the name 
of your chaste wife I will become your maid 
your slave your servant any thing you will 
if for that name of servant and of slave 
you will but smile upon i now and then 
or if as I well think you can love i 
love where you list only say but you love i 
I will feed on shadow let the substance go 
will you deny i such a small request 
what will you neither love nor flatter i 
o then I see your hate here do but wound i 
and with that hate it be your frown confound i 

wonder of woman why hark you m Arthur 
what be your wife a woman or a saint 
a wife or some bright angel come from heaven 
be you not move at this strange spectacle 
this day I have behold a miracle 
when I attempt this sacred nuptial life 
I beg of heaven to find i such a wife 

ha ha a miracle a prodigy 
to see a woman weep be as much pity 
as to see fox dig out of their hole 
if thou will pleasure i let i see thou less 
grieve much they say grief often shorten life 
come not too near i till I call he wife 
and that will be but seldom I will tell thou 
how thou shall win my heart die sudden 
and I will become a lusty widower 
the long thy life last the more my hate 
and loathe still increase towards thou 
when I come home and find thou cold as earth 
then will I love thou thus thou know my mind 
Come m Lusam let we in to dine 

o sir you too much affect this evil 
poor saint why be thou yoke thus with a devil 

if thou will win my heart die sudden 
but that my soul be buy at such a rate 
at such a high price as my saviour blood 
I will not stick to lose it with a stab 
but virtue banish all such fantasy 
he be my husband and I love he well 
next to my own soul health I tender he 
and will give all the pleasure of the world 
to buy his love if I may purchase it 
I will follow he and like a servant wait 
and strive by all mean to prevent his hate 

this be my son house be it best go in 
how say you master Lusam 

How go in how say you sir 

I say it be best 

ay sir say you so so say I too 

nay nay it be not best I will tell you why 
happy the fire of hate be quite extinct 
from the dead ember now to rake they up 
shall the least spark of discontent appear 
to make the flame of hatred burn afresh 
the heat of this dissension may scorch we 
which in his own cold ash smother up 
may die in silence and revive no more 
and therefore tell i be it best or no 

How say you sir 

I say it be not best 

mass you say well sir and so say I too 

but shall we lose our labour to come hither 
and without sight of our two child 
go back again nay we will in that be certain 

in quoth he do you make a doubt of that 
shall we come thus far and in such post haste 
and have our child here and both within 
and not behold they ere our back return 
it be unfriendly and unfatherly 
come m Arthur pray you follow i 

nay but hark you sir will you not knock 

be it best to knock 

I knock in any case 

it be well you put it in mind to knock 
I have forget it else I promise you 

tush be it not my son and your daughter door 
and shall we two stand knock lead the way 

Knock at our child door that be a jest 
be we such fool to make ourselves so strange 
where we shall still be bold in for shame 
we will not stand upon such ceremony 

speak in what cue sir do you find your heart 
now thou have sleep a little on thy love 

like one that strive to shun a little plash 
of shallow water and avoid it 
plunge into a river past his depth 
like one that from a small spark step aside 
and fall in headlong to a great flame 

but in such fire scorch not thyself for shame 
if she be fire thou be so far from burn 
that thou have scarce yet warm thou at her face 
but list to i I will turn thy heart from love 
and make thou loathe all of the feminine sex 
they that have know i know i once of name 
to be a perfect wencher I have try 
all sort all sect all state and find they still 
inconstant fickle always variable 
attend i man I will prescribe a method 
how thou shall win she without all peradventure 

that will I glad hear 

I be once like thou 
a fighter melancholy humorist 
crosser of arm a goer without garter 
a hatbandhater and a buskpoint wearer 
one that do use much bracelet make of hair 
ring on my finger jewel in my ear 
and now and then a wench carcanet 
that have two letter for her name in pearl 
scarf garter band wrought waistcoat gold stitch cap 
a thousand of those female foolery 
but when I look into the glass of reason straight I begin 
to loathe that female bravery and henceforth 
study to cry peccavi to the world 

I pray you to your former argument 
prescribe a mean to win my best belove 

First be not bashful bar all blush trick 
be not too apish female do not come 
with foolish sonnet to present she with 
with leg with courtesy congee and such like 
nor with pen speech or too far fetch sigh 
I hate such antic quaint formality 

o but I can watch occasion 
she dash every proffer with a frown 

a frown a fool be thou afraid of frown 
he that will leave occasion for a frown 
be I his judge all you his case bemoan 
his doom shall be ever to lie alone 

I can choose but when a wench say nay 
to take she at her word and leave my suit 

continue that opinion and be sure 
to die a virgin chaste a maiden pure 
it be my chance once in my wanton day 
to court a wench hark and I will tell thou how 
I come unto my love and she look coy 
I speak unto my love she turn aside 
I touch my love and begin with she to toy 
but she sit mute for anger or for pride 
I strive and kiss my love she cry away 
thou will have leave she thus I make she stay 
I catch my love and wring she by the hand 
I take my love and set she on my knee 
and pull she to i o you spoil my band 
you hurt i sir pray let i go quoth she 
I be glad quoth I that you have find your tongue 
and still my love I by the finger wrong 
I ask she if she love i she say no 
I bid she swear she straight call for a book 
nay then think I it be time to let she go 
I ease my knee and from her cast a look 
she leave i wonder at these strange affair 
and like the wind she trip i up the stair 
I leave the room below and up I go 
find she throw upon her wanton bed 
I ask the cause of her sad discontent 
further she lie and make room she say 
now sweeting kiss i have time and place 
so cling i too she with a sweet embrace 

be it possible I have not think till now 
that woman can dissemble m Fuller 
here dwell the sacred mistress of my heart 
before her door I will frame a frivolous walk 
and spy she with her devise some talk 

what stir be this let we step but out the way 
and hear the utmost what these people say 

thou be a knave although thou be my son 
have I with care and trouble bring thou up 
to be a staff and comfort to my age 
a pillar to support i and a crutch 
to lean on in my second infancy 
and do thou use i thus thou be a knave 

a knave I marry and a arrant knave 
and sirrah by old m Arthur leave 
though I be weak and old I will prove thou one 

sir though it be my father pleasure thus 
to wrong i with the scorn name of knave 
I will not have you so familiar 
nor so presume upon my patience 

speak m Arthur be he not a knave 

I say he be a knave 

then so say I 

my father may command my patience 
but you sir that be but my father in law 
shall not so mock my reputation 
sir you shall find I be a honest man 

a honest man 

ay sir so I say 

nay if you say so I will not be against it 
but sir you may have use my daughter better 
than to have beat she spurn she rail at she 
before our face 

I therein son Arthur 
thou show thyself no better than a knave 

I marry do he I will stand to it 
to use my honest daughter in such sort 
he show himself not better than a knave 

I say again I be a honest man 
he wrong i that shall say the contrary 

I grant sir that you be a honest man 
nor will I say unto the contrary 
but wherefore do you use my daughter thus 
can you accuse she of inchastity 
of loose demeanour disobedience or disloyalty 
speak what thou can thou object against my daughter 

accuse she here she stand spit in her face 
if she be guilty in the least of these 

o father be more patient if you wrong 
my honest husband all the blame be i 
because you do it only for my sake 
I be his handmaid since it be his pleasure 
to use i thus I be content therewith 
and bear his check and cross patient 

if in my own house I can have no place 
I will seek it elsewhere and frequent it less 
father I be now past one and twenty year 
I be past my father pamper I suck not 
nor be I dandle on my mother knee 
then if you be my father twenty time 
you shall not choose but let i be myself 
do I come home so seldom and that seldom 
be I thus bait wife remember this 
father farewell and father in law adieu 
your son have rather fast than feast with you 

well go to wild oat spend thrift prodigal 
I will cross thy name quite from my reckon book 
for these account faith it shall scathe thou somewhat 
I will not say what somewhat it shall be 

and it shall scathe he somewhat of my purse 
and daughter I will take thou home again 
since thus he hate thy fellowship 
be such a eyesore to his sight no more 
I tell thou thou no more shall trouble he 

Will you divorce who God have tie together 
or break that knot the sacred hand of heaven

what a great curse be lay upon his head 
that break the holy band of marriage 
divorce husband from their choose wife 
father I will not leave my Arthur so 
not all my friend can make i prove his foe 

I can say somewhat in my son reproof

but for my husband sake let these woe be 
for when I weep it be not for my own care 
but fear least folly bring he to despair 

sweet saint continue still this patience 
for time will bring he to true penitence 
mirror of virtue thanks for my good cheer 
a thousand thanks 

it be so much too dear 
but you be welcome for my husband sake 
his guest shall have best welcome I can make 

then marriage nothing in the world more common 
nothing more rare than such a virtuous woman 

my husband in this humour well I know 
play but the unthrift therefore it behoove i 
to be the better huswife here at home 
to save and get while he do laugh and spend 
though for himself he riot it enlarge 
my needle shall defray my household charge 

now m Anselm to she step not back 
busy yourself see where she sit at work 
be not afraid man she be but a woman 
and woman the most coward seldom fear 
think but upon my former principle 
and twenty pound to a dream you speed 

ay say you so 

beware of blush sirrah 
of fear and too much eloquence 
rail on her husband his misuse she 
and make that serve thou as a argument 
that she may soon yield to do he wrong 
be it my case my love and I to plead 
I have it at singer end who can miss the clout 
have so fair a white such steady aim 
this be the upshot now bid for the game 

fair mistress God save you 

what a circumstance do he begin with what a ass be he 
to tell she at the first that she be fair 
the only mean to make she to be coy 
he shall have rather tell she she be foul 
and bring she out of love quite with herself 
and be so she will the less have care 
upon who secret she have lay her love 
he have almost mar all with that word fair 

mistress God save you

to say God save you be the fellow mad 
once to name God in his ungodly suit

the plain broad high way and the ready path 
to travel round about by circumstance

and now have lose his opportunity 
never be such a truant in love school

I will not know but what you mean by villain 
I fain will know 

that villain be your husband 
who wrong towards you be bruit through the land 
o can you suffer at a peasant hand 
unworthy once to touch this silken skin 
to be so rude beat and buffet 
can you endure from such infectious breath 
able to blast your beauty to have name 
of such empoison hate fling in your face 

o that be good nothing be good but that 
that be the lesson that I teach he last

wound with word of shame and infamy 
o can you see your pleasure deal away 
and you to be debar all part of they 
and bury it in deep oblivion

among hungry bawd insatiable courtesan 
and can you love that villain by who deed 
your soul do sigh and your distress heart bleed 

all this as well as I can wish myself

and neither know my husband nor myself 
or else you know not man and wife be one 
if he be call a villain what be she 
who heart and love and soul be one with he

for her own credit though no love to he

I say again and I know what I do 
I will not name a man alive but you

I steal behind she till I have her fair 
then with my hand I close both her eye 
she blind thus begin to bethink she 
which of she love it be that do hoodwink she 
first she begin to guess and name a man 
that I well know but she have know far better 
the next I never do suspect till than 
still of my name I can not hear a letter 
then mad she do name Robin and then james 
till she have reckon up some twenty name 
at length when she have count up her score 
as one among the rest she hit on i

and since I swear both by her mask and fan 
to trust no she tongue that can name a man 

your great oath have some exception 
but to our former purpose you be mistress Arthur 
we will attempt another kind of woo 
and make she hate her husband if we can 

but not a word of passion or of love 
have at she now to try her patience 
God save you mistress 

you be welcome sir 

I pray you where be your husband 

not within 

who m Arthur he I see even now 
at mistress Mary the brave courtesan 

wrong not my husband reputation so 
I neither can nor will believe you sir 

poor gentlewoman how much I pity you 
your husband be become her only guest 
he lodge there and daily diet there 
he riot revel and do all thing 
nay he be hold the m of misrule 
among a most loathe and abhor crew 
and can you be a woman suffer this 

sir sir I understand you well enough 
admit my husband do frequent that house 
of such dishonest usage I suppose 
he do it but in zeal to bring they home 
by his good counsel from that course of sin 
and like a christian see they astray 
in the broad path that to damnation lead 
he use thither to direct their foot 
into the narrow way that guide to heaven 

be ever woman gull so palpable 
but mistress Arthur think you as you say 

sir what I think I think and what I say 
I will I can enjoin you to believe 

faith mistress Arthur I be sorry for you 
and in good sooth I wish it lie in i 
to remedy the least part of these wrong 
your unkind husband daily proffer you 

you be deceive he be not unkind 
although he bear a outward face of hate 
his heart and soul be both assure i 

fie mistress Arthur take a better spirit 
be not so timorous to rehearse your wrong 
I say your husband haunt bad company 
swaggerer cheater wanton courtesan 
there he defile his body stain his soul 
consume his wealth undo himself and you 
in danger of disease who vild name 
be not for any honest mouth to speak 
nor any chaste ear to receive and hear 
o he will bring that face admire for beauty 
to be more loathe than a leprous skin 
divorce yourself now while the cloud grow black 
prepare yourself a shelter for the storm 
abandon his most loathe fellowship 
you be young mistress will you lose your youth 

tempt no more devil thy deformity 
have change itself into a angel shape 
but yet I know thou by thy course of speech 
thou get a apple to betray poor Eve 
who outside bear a show of pleasant fruit 
but the vild branch on which this apple grow 
be that which draw poor Eve from paradise 
thy siren song can make i drown myself 
but I be tie unto the mast of truth 
admit my husband be incline to vice 
my virtue may in time recall he home 
but if we both shall desperate run to sin 
we shall abide certain destruction 
but he be like one that over a sweet face 
put a deform vizard for his soul 
be free from any such intent of ill 
only to try my patience he put on 
a ugly shape of black intemperance 
therefore this blot of shame which he now wear 
I with my prayer will purge wash with tear

listen a while and hear this oboe speak

here be no wall or post which I can soil within my bruise brain 
first will I therefore say 2 or 3 creed and avemary

I prithee Anselm but observe this fellow 
do not hear he he will die for love 
that misshape love thou will condemn in he 
I see in thou I prithee note he well 

be I assure that I be such a lover 
I shall be with myself quite out of love 
I prithee let we persuade he still to live 

that be a dangerous case perhaps the fellow 
in desperation will to soothe we up 
promise repentant recantation 
and after fall into that desperate course 
both which I will prevent with policy

and use that I hope to please you both

for he that live must die and she that be dead 
can be revive 

Lusam thou seek to rob i of my son my only son 

he rob i of my daughter my only daughter 

and robber be flat felon by the law 

Lusam I say thou be a bloodsucker 
a tyrant a remorseless cannibal

be I a bloodsucker or cannibal 
be I a tyrant that do thirst for blood 

i if thou seek the ruin of my son 
thou be a tyrant and a bloodsucker 

i if I seek the ruin of thy son I be indeed 

nay more thou be a dotard 
and in the right of my accurse son

God precious call i dotard 

I have cause 
just cause to call thou dotard have I not 

nay that be another matter have you cause 
than God forbid that I shall take exception 
to be call dotard of one that have cause 

my master you must leave this quarrel for quarreller be never at peace and man of peace while they be at quiet be never quarrel so you while you fall into brawl you can choose but jar here come your son accuse and your wife the accuser stand forth both Hugh be ready with your pen and ink to take their examination and confession 

it shall not need I do confess the deed 
of which this woman here accuse i 
I poison my first wife and for that deed 
I yield i to the mercy of the law 

villain thou mean my only daughter 
and in her death deprive i of all joy 

I mean she I do confess the deed 
and though my body taste the force of law 
like a offender on my knee I beg 
your angry soul will pardon i her death 

nay if he kneel do confess the deed 
no reason but I shall forgive her death 

but so the law must not be satisfy 
blood must have blood and man must have death 
I think that can be dispense withal 

if all the world else will forgive the deed 
yet will I earnest pursue the law 

I have a wife will not have use i so 
the wealth of Europe can not hire her tongue 
to be offensive to my patient ear 
but in exchange she I do prefer 
a devil before a saint night before day 
hell before heaven and dross before try gold 
never be bargain with such damage sell 

if you want witness to confirm the deed 
I hear he speak it and that to his face 
before this presence I will justify 
I will not part hence till I see he swing 

I hear he too pity but he shall die 
and like a murderer be send to hell 
to poison she and make her belly swell 

why stay you then give judgement on the slave 
who shameless life deserve a shameful grave 

death bitter pang be not so full of grief 
as this unkindness every word thou speak 
be a sharp dagger thrust quite through my heart 
as little I deserve this at thy hand 
as my kind patient wife deserve of i 
I be her torment God have make thou i 
then wherefore at just plague shall I repine 

where do thou buy this poison for such drug 
be felony for any man to sell 

I have the poison of Aminadab 
but innocent man he be not accessary 
to my wife death I clear he of the deed 

no matter fetch he fetch he bring he 
to answer to this matter at the bar

that have try both in wealth and misery 
a good wife will be careful of her fame 
her husband credit and her own good name 
and such be thou a bad wife will respect 
her pride her lust and her good name neglect 
and such be thou a good wife will be still 
Industrious apt to do her husband will 
but a bad wife cross spiteful and mad 
never keep home but always be a gad 
and such be thou a good wife will conceal 
her husband danger and nothing reveal 
that may procure he harm and such be thou 
but a bad wife corrupt chaste wedlock be vow 
on this hand virtue and on this hand sin 
this who will strive to lose or this to win 
here live perpetual joy here burn woe 
now husband choose on which hand you will go 
seek virtuous wife all husband will be bless 
fair wife be good but virtuous wife be best 
they that my fortune will peruse shall find 
no beauty like the beauty of the mind
