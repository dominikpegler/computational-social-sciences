on his marriage night and up at this hour nay if I once suspect it be as firm as if it be confirm by Alcoran or Mahomet himself have swear it I will sport myself with his distaste and sorrow

why either such a small effuse of blood 
these your slight wound or the pale fear of death

a noble eye 

why think thou bashaw 
that wound blood or death 
can force a tear from i thou noble of thy nation

can you to save he leave i to my death be this 
the just reward of all my travel 

I prize my honour and a Christian faith 
above what earth can yield shall Fez report 
unto our country shame and to the scandal 
of our religion that a barbarous moor 
can exceed we in nobleness no I will die 
a hundred thousand death first 

o my fate be ever maid thus cross 
that have so oft be bring to see my bliss 
and never taste it to meet my Spencer live after death 
to join with he in marriage not enjoy he 
to have he here free from the barbarous moor 
and now to lose he be so often raise 
unto the height of all felicity 
to make my ruin great if you needs 
will hazard your own person make i partner 
in this thy present danger take i with thou 

not for the world no live soul shall bleed

which be a moor I have express to he 
he will not see i perish 

foolish bashaw 
to jest away thy head you be all conspirator 
against our person and you all shall die

both in country and religion be embark 
at sea and under sail free from our band 
in the arm of his fair bride 
his captain and his sailor all above 
sea room and wind at will and will return 
to expose all this to voluntary danger 
for a bare verbal promise

in these two stranger for I have little hope 
to find they worthy your great character 

there must be great presumption that must force belief to that 

nay more than presumption proof 
or they will win small credit 

you have from we lady a costly jewel 
it cost ten thousand crown speak can you show it 

I keep it chary 
as i own heart because it come from you 
but hurry through the street some cheat fellow 
snatch it from my arm therefore my suit be

who can with the least honour speak for he 
the theft be so apparent 

now if she shall challenge i with the purse she give i and hang I up for my labour I shall curse the time that ever I be a courtier 

let i descend and ere I judge the felon 
survey he first it be pity for it seem 
he have a honest face the word be never 

what Besse forget yourself 

a indifferent proper man and take these course you say you will not speak nor look upon nor touch your Bess 

I can be a new Sinon and betray 
a second Troy rather than suffer this 

good outward part but in a foreign clime 
shame your own country never think of that 

I fear my heart will break 
it do so struggle for eruption forth 

when do you speak his sentence lady 

you will confirm it whatever it be 

as we be prince we will 

set forth the prisoner 

stand forward Englishman

and in thy arm throw a most constant wife 
if thou have rash swear thy oath be free 
thou be i by gift I give myself to thou 

lady we understand not this 

shall I make it plain 
this be great duke my husband 
who virtue even the barbarous moor admire 
This the man for who a thousand danger I have endure 
of who the best approve chronicler 
may write a golden legend 

my lord I know that gentleman 
for Spencer and her husband for my eye 
see they espouse in Fez that gentleman 
as I take it be captain of the negro 
the other his lieutenant 

and do not you know i 

not I sir 

I be bashaw of Barbary by the same token I sell certain precious stone to purchase the place 

lady you tell we he be the author 
of all your trouble care and fear 

I tell true his love be cause of all 
it draw i from my country in his quest 
when I despair and find he in Fez 
o do but think great duke if ever you love 
what may have buy he from you 
have my Spencer be a Eurydice 
I will have play the Orpheus 
and find he out in hell 

we now perceive 
the cause of all these error his unkindness 
ground on his rash oath which we release 
and all those virtue honour and renown 
which even the barbarous moor seem to admire 
we will dignify and raise their suffrage high 

Florence be honourable 

bring in the bashaw call venturo forth 

duke I be prisoner 
put i to ransom or to death but to death rather 
for methinks a soldier shall not outlive bondage 

bashaw joffer 
leave my embrace Bess for I of force be cast 
into his arm my noble friend 

I know you not and I can wish you do not know i now I be a prisoner a wretch a captive and such a one as I will not have my friend to know I pray stand off 

because you be in durance 
shall I not know you no 
for then the noble mind shall friend best know 
have you forget i sir 

no be I in freedom and my princely honour 
I shall then be proud to call you Spencer 
and my friend but now 

a english virtue thou shall try 
that for my life once do not fear to die 
that for his noble office do to i 
embrace he Bess dear Goodlack and the rest 
while to this prince I kneel this be the bashaw 
king Mullisheg make he great viceroy of Algiers 
I know not prince how he be fall so low 
but if myself my friend and all my fortune 
may redeem he home unto my naked skin 
I will sell myself and if my wealth 
will not amount so much I will leave myself in hostage 

it be the part 
of a most noble friend 

and in these time worthy admiration 

I wonder not the moor so grace this nation 
if all the english equal their virtue 
for this brave stranger so endear to thou 
pass to thy country ransomless and free 

royal in all thing be the duke of Florence 

such honour be not find in Barbary 
the virtue in these Christian have convert i 
which to the world I can no long smother 
accept i then a christian and a brother 

prince 
these unexpected novelty 
shall add unto the high solemnity 
of your best welcome worthy Englishman 
and you the mirror of your sex and nation 
fair english Elizabeth as well for virtue 
as admire beauty we will give you cause ere 
you depart our court to say great Fez

the fair maid never pattern in her life 
so fair a virgin and so chaste a wife
