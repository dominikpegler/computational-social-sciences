sir I be no boy I be deep in one and twenty 
the second year be approach 

a fine time 
for a youth to live by his wit then I shall think 
if ever he mean to make account of any 

wit sir 

I wit sir if it be so strange to thou 
I be sorry I spend that time to get a fool 
I may have employ my pain a great deal better 
thou know all that I have I ha get by my wit 
and yet to see how urgent thou be too 
it grieve i thou be so degenerate 
to trouble i for mean I never offer it 
my parent from a schoolboy past nineteen once 
see what these time be grow too before twenty 
I rush into the world which be indeed 
much like the art of swim he that will attain to it 
must fall plump and duck himself at first 
and that will make he hardy and adventurous 
and not stand put in one foot and shiver 
and then draw other after like a quakebuttock 
well he may make a paddler in the world 
from hand to mouth but never a brave swimmer 
bear up by the chin as I bear up myself 
with my strong industry that never fail i 
for he that lie bear up with patrimony 
look like a long great ass that swim with bladder 
come but one prick of adverse fortune to he 
he sink because he never try to swim 
when wit play with the billow that choke he 

why be it not a fashion for a father sir 
out of his yearly thousand to allow 
his only son a competent brace of hundred 
or such a toy 

yes if he mean to spoil he 
or mar his wit he may but never I 
this be my humour sir which you will find constant 
I love wit so well because I live by it 
that I will give no man power out of my mean to hurt it 
and that be a kind of gratitude to my raiser 
which great one oft forget I admire much 
this age dulness when I scarce write man 
the first degree that ever I take in thrive 
I lay intelligencer close for wench 
can give this lord or knight a true certificate 
of all the maidenhead extant how many lay 
amongst chambermaid how many amongst exchange wench 
though never many there I must confess 
they have a trick to utter ware so fast 
I know which lady have a mind to fall 
which gentlewoman new divorce which tradesman break 
the price of every sinner to a hair 
and where to raise each price which be the termer 
that will give velvet petticoat tissue gown 
which piece angel supper and half crown 
I know how to match and make my market 
can give intelligence where the pox lay ledger 
and then to see the lecher shift a point 
it be sport and profit too how they will shun 
their adore mistress chamber and run fearful 
like rat from burn house so bring I 
my client of the game still safe together 
and noble gamester love i and I feel it 
give i a man that live by his wit say I 
and never leave a groat there be the true gallant 
when I grow somewhat pursy I grow then 
in man opinion too and confidence 
they put thing call executorship upon i 
the charge of orphan little senseless creature 
who in their childhood I bind forth to feltmaker 
to make they lose and work away their gentry 
disguise their tender nature with hard custom 
so wrought they out in time there I rise ungentle 
nor do I fear to discourse this unto thou 
I be arm at all point against treachery 
I hold my humour firm if I can see thou thrive by 
thy wit while I live I shall have the more courage 
to trust thou with my land when I die if not 
the next best wit I can hear of carry they 
for since in my time and knowledge so many rich child 
of the city conclude in beggary I will rather 
make a wise stranger my executor than a foolish 
son my heir and to have my land call after my 
wit thou after my name and that be my nature 

it be a strange harsh one must I still shift then 
I come brave cheat once to my trade again 
and I will ply it hard now than ever I do for it

not a jot sir 

if I shall ask you blessing ere I go sir 
I think you will not give it i
