thou can not see that which can with reason be imagine for it the divine virtue of love have disperse themselves through the power of the world so forcible as to make they take by his influence the form and quality impress within they no doubt they can not choose but favour more of his divinity 

I do not think love have any spark of divinity in he since the end or his be be earthly in the blood be he beget by the frail fire of the eye and quench by the frail shadow of thought what reason have we then to soothe his humour with such zeal and follow his fade delight with such passion 

we have body Silvestris and humane body which in their own nature be much more wretched than beast and much more miserable than beast pursue their own ruin and since it will ask long labour and study to subdue the power of our blood to the rule of the soul than to satisfy they with the fruition of our love let we be constant in the world error and seek our own torment 

as good yield indeed submissive and satisfy part of our affection as be stubborn without ability to resist and enjoy none of they I be in worst plight since I love a nymph that mock love 

and I one that hate love 

ay one that think herself above love 

let we not dispute who mistress be most bad since they be all cruel nor which of our fortune be most froward since they be all desperate I will hang my scutcheon on this tree in honour of Ceres and write this verse on the tree in hope of my success penelopen ipsam perstes mode tempore vinces Penelope will yield at last continue and conquer 

I this fructus abest facies cum bona testae caret fair face lose their favour if they admit no lover 

but why study thou what will thou write for thy lady to read 

that which necessity make i to endure love reverence wisdom wonder at rivalem patient habe 

Come let we every one to our walk it may be we shall meet they walk exeunt 

it be time to hang up our garland this be our harvest holiday we must both sing and dance in the honour of Ceres of what colour or flower be thy make of Niobe 

or salamints which in the morning be white red at noon and in the evening purple for in my affection shall there be no staidness but in unstaidness but what be you of Nisa 

of holly because it be most holy which lovely green neither the sun beam nor the wind blast can alter or diminish but Celia what garland have you 

Mine all of cypress leave which be broad and beautiful yet bear the least fruit for beauty make the bright show be the slight substance and I be content to wither before I be wear and deprive myself of that which so many desire 

Come let we make a end lest Ceres come and find we slack in perform that which we owe but soft some have be here this morning before we 

the amorous forester or none for in the wood they have eat so much wakerobin that they can sleep for love 

alas poor soul how ill love sound in their lip who tell a long tale of hunt think they have bewray a sad passion of love 

give they leave to love since we have liberty to choose for as great sport do I take in course their tame heart as they do pain in hunt their wild heart 

Niobe your affection be but pin to your tongue which when you lift you can unloose but let we read what they have write Penelopen ipsam perstes mode tempore vinces that be for you Nisa who nothing will move yet hope make he hover 

a fond hobby to hover over a eagle 

but forester think all bird to be bunting what be the next fructus abest facies cum bona testae caret Celia the forester give you good counsel take your pennyworth while the market serve 

I hope it will be market day till my death day 

let i read to Riualem patient habe he touch you Niobe on the quick yet you see how patient he be in your constancy 

inconstancy be a vice which I will not swap for all the virtue though I throw one off with my whole hand I can pull he again with my little finger let we encourage they and write something if they censure in favourable we know they fool if angry we will say they be froward 

I will begin cedit amor rebus res age tutus eris 

Indeed better to tell star then be idle yet better idle then ill employ my this sit mihi sifacies sit bene nota mihi 

you care for nothing but a glass that be a flatterer 

then all man be glass 

some glass be true 

no man be but this be i victoriatecum stabit 

thou give hope 

he be worthy of that be patient 

let we sing and so attend on Ceres for this day although into her heart never enter any motion of love yet usual to the temple of Cupid he offer two white dove as entreat his favour and one eagle as command his power praecibusque mina regaliter addet 

what noise be this what assembly what idolatry be the modesty of virgin turn to wantonness the honour of Ceres account immortal and Erisychthon ruler of this forest esteem of no force impudent giglot that you be to disturb my game or dare do honour to any but Erisychthon it be not your fair face as smooth as lea●e nor your entice eye though they draw iron like adamant nor your file speech be they as forcible as Thessalid that shall make i any way flexible 

Erisychthon thy stern look join with thy stout speech thy word as unkempt as thy lock be able to affright man of bold courage and to make we silly girl frantic that be full of fear but know thou Erisychthon that be thy hand so unstated as thy tongue and the one as ready to execute mischief as the other to threaten it it shall neither move our heart to ask pity or remove our body from this place we be the handmaiden of divine Ceres to fair Ceres be this holy tree dedicate to Ceres by who favour thyself live that be worthy to perish 

be you addict to Ceres that in spite of Erisychthon you will use these sacrifice no immodest girl you shall see that I have neither regard of your sex which man shall tender nor of your beauty which foolish love will dote on nor of your goddess which none but peevish girl reverence I will destroy this tree in despite of all and that you may see my hand execute what my heart intend and that no mean may appease my malice my last word shall be the beginning of the first blow 

Oure alas what have he do 

ourselves I fear must also minister matter to his fury 

let he alone but see the tree pour our blood and I hear a voice 

what voice if in the tree there be anybody speak quick leave the next blow hit the tale out of thy mouth 

monster of man hate of the heaven and to the earth a burden what have chaste Fidelia commit it be thy spite Cupid that have no power to wound my unsported mind procure mean to mangle my tender body and by violence to gash those side that enclose a heart dedicate to virtue or be it that savage satire that feed his sensual appetite upon lust seek now to quench it with blood that be without hope to attain my love he may with cruelty end my life or do Ceres who nymph I have be many year in recompense of my inviolable faith reward i with unspeakable torment divine Phoebus that pursue Daphne till she be turn to a bay tree cease then to trouble she ay the god be pitiful and Cineras that with fury follow his daughter Miretia till she be change to a myrrhtree leave then to prosecute she yea parent be natural Phoebus lament the loss of his friend Cineras of his child but both god and man either forget or neglect the change of Fidelia nay follow she after her change to make she more miserable so that there be nothing more hateful than to be chaste whole body be follow in the world with lust and prosecute in the grave with tyranny who mind the free they be from vice their body be in the more danger of mischief so that they be not safe when they live because of man love nor be change because of their hate nor be dead because of their defame what be that chastity which so few woman study to keep and both god and man seek to violate if only a naked name why be we so superstitious of a hollow find if a rare virtue why be man so careless of such a exceed rareness go lady tell Ceres I be that Fidelia that so long knit garland in her honour and chase with a satire by prayer to the god become turn to a tree who body now be grow over with rough bark and who golden lock be cover with green leaf yet where mind nothing can alter neither the fear of death nor the torment if Ceres seek no revenge then let virginity be not only the scorn of savage people but the spoil but alas I feel my last blood to come and therefore must end my last breath farewell lady who life be subject to many mischief for if you be fair it be hard to be chaste if chaste impossible to be safe if you be young you will quick bend if bend you be sudden break if you be soul you shall seldom be flatter if you be not flatter you will ever be sorrowful beauty be a firm fickleness youth a feeble staidness deformity a continual sadness 

thou monster can thou hear this without grief 

yea and double your grief with my blow 

ah poor Fidelia the express pattern of chastity and example of misfortune 

ah cruel Erisychthon that not only deface these holy tree but murder also this chaste nymph 

nymph or goddess it skill not for there be none that Erisychthon care for but Erisychthon let Ceres the lady of your harvest revenge when she will nay when she dare and tell she this that I be Erisychthon 

thou be none of the god 

no a contemner of the god 

and hope thou to escape revenge be but a man 

yea I care not for revenge be a man and Erisychthon 

Come let we to Ceres and complain of this unacquainted and incredible villain if there be power in her deity in her mind pity or virtue in virginity this monster can escape exeunt 

do Erisychthon offer force to my nymph and to my deity disgrace have I stuff his barn with fruitful grain and do he stretch his hand against i with intolerable pride so it be Ceres thy eye may witness what thy nymph have tell here lie the tree hack in piece and the blood scarce cold of the fair virgin if this be thy cruelty Cupid I will no more hallow thy temple with sacred vow if thy canker nature Erisychthon thou shall find as great misery as thou show malice I be resolve of thy punishment and as speedy shall be my revenge as thy rigour barbarous tirtenae on yonder lull where never grow grain nor lease where nothing be but barrenness and coldness fear and paleness lie famine go to she and say that Ceres command she to gnaw on the bowel of Erisychthon that his hunger may be as unquenchable as his fury 

I obey but how shall I know she from other 

thou can not miss of she if thou remember but her name and that can thou not forget for that come near to the place thou shall find gnaw in thy stomach Shee lie gape and swallow enough but air her face pale and so lean that as easy thou may through the very skin behold the bone as in a glass thy shadow her hair long black and shaggy her eye sink so far into her head that she look out of the nape of her neck her lip white and rough her tooth hollow and red with rustiness her skin so thin that thou may as lively make a anatomy of her body as she be cut up with chirurgeon her maw like a dry bladder her heart swell big with wind and all her bowel like snake work in her body this monster when thou shall behold tell she my mind and return with speed 

I go fear more the sight of famine than the force 

take thou these few care of corn but let not famine so much as smell to they and let she go aloof from thou now shall Erisychthon see that Ceres be a great goddess as full of power as himself of pride and as pitiless as he presumptuous how think you lady be not this revenge apt for so great injury 

yes madam to let man see they that contend with the god do but confound themselves 

but let we to the temple of Cupid and offer sacrifice they that think it strange for chastity to humble itself to Cupid know neither the power of love nor the nature of virginity the one have absolute authority to command the other difficulty to resist and where such continual war be between love and virtue there must be some party and continual peril Cupid be never conquer and therefore must be flatter virginity have and therefore must be humble 

into my heart madam there do never enter any motion of love 

those that often say they can love or will not love certain they love do thou never see Cupid 

no but I have hear he describe at the full and as I imagine foolish first that he shall be a god blind and naked with wing with bow with arrow with freebrand swim sometime in the sea and play sometime on the shore with many other device which the painter be the poet ape have take as great pain to shadow as they to lie can I think that god that command all thing will go naked what shall he do with wing that know not where to slice or what with arrow that see not how to aim the heart be a narrow mark go hit and rather require Argus eye to take level there a blind boy to shoot at random if he be fire the sea will quench those coal or the flame turn he into cinder 

well Nisa thou shall see he 

I fear Niobe have feel he 

not I madam yet must I confess that oftentimes I have have sweet thought sometime hard conceit betwixt both a kind of yield I know not what but certain I think it be not love sigh I can and find ease in melancholy smile I do and take pleasure in imagination I feel in myself a please pain a chill heat a delicate bitterness how to term it I know not without doubt it may be love sure I be it be not hate 

Niobe be tender heart who thought be like water yield to every thing and nothing to be see 

well let we to Cupid and take heed that in your stubborness you will offend he not who by entreaty you ought to follow Diana nymph be as chaste as Ceres virgin as fair as wife how Cupid torment they I have rather you shall hear then feel but this be truth they all yield to love look not scornful my nymph I say they be yield to love this be the temple thou great god Cupid who the god regard and man reverence let it be lawful for Ceres to offer her sacrifice 

divine Ceres Cupid accept any thing that come from Ceres which feed my sparrow with ripe corn my pigeon with wholesome seed and honour my temple with chaste virgin 

then love to thou I bring these white and spotless dove in token that my heart be as free from any thought of love as these from any blemish and as clear in virginity as these perfect in whiteness but that my nymph may know both thy power and thy law and neither err in ignorance nor pride let i ask some question to instruct they that they offend not those who resist they can in virgin what do thou chief desire 

in those that be not in love reverent thought of love in those that be faithful vow 

what do thou most hate in virgin 

pride in the beautiful bitter taunt in the witty incredulity in all 

what may protect my virgin that they may never love 

that they be never idle 

why do thou so cruel torment all Diana nymph with love 

because they think it impossible to love 

what be the substance of love 

constancy and secrecy 

what the sign 

sigh and tear 

what the cause 

wit and idleness 

what the mean 

opportunity and importunity 

what the end 

happiness without end 

what require thou of man 

that only shall be know to man 

what revenge for those that will not love 

to be deceive when they do 

well Cupid entreat my nymph with favour and though to love it be no vice yet spotless virginity be the only virtue let i keep their thought as chaste as their body than Ceres may be happy and they praise 

why Ceres do you think that lust follow love Ceres lover be chaste for what be love divine love but the quintessence of chastity and affection bind by heavenly motion thou can be undo by earthly mean  by any man 

 continual sacrifice warm we with mild  we seem immodest  ●ble like stock 

Ceres  be light nor obstinacy  and faithful so shall your flame warm but not burn delight and never discomfort 

How say you my nymph do not Cupid speak like a god counsel you I will not to love but conjure you I must that you be not disdainful let we in and see how Erisicthon speed famine fly swift and have already seize on his stomach 

stay cruel Nisa thou know not from who thou fly and therefore fly I come not to offer violence but that which be inviolable my thought be as holy as thy vow and I as constant in love as thou in cruelty lust follow not my love as shadow do body but truth be weave into my love as vein into body let i touch this tender arm and say my love be endless 

and to no end 

it be without spot 

and shall be without hope 

do thou disdain love and his law 

I do not disdain that which I think be not yet laugh at those that honour it if it be 

time shall bring to pass that Nisa shall confess there be love 

then also will love make i confess that Nisa be a fool 

be it folly to love which the god account honourable and man esteem holy 

the god make any thing lawful because they be god and man honour shadow for substance because they be man 

both god and man agree that love be a consume of the heart and restore a bitter death in a sweet life 

god do know and man shall that love be a consume of wit and restore of folly a stare blindness and a blind gaze 

will thou allot i death 

no but discretion 

yield some hope 

hope to despair 

not so long as Nisa be a woman 

therein Ramis you show yourself a man 

why 

in flatter yourself that all woman will yield 

all may 

thou shall swear that we can 

I will follow thou and practise by denial to be patient or by disdain die and so be happy 

though thou have overtake i in love yet have I overtake thou in run fair Celia yield to love to sweet love 

Montanus thou be mad that have no breath almost in run so fast thou will yet spend more in speak so foolish yield to love can or if I do to thy love I will not 

the fair wolf choose the foul if he be faithful and he that endure most grief nor he that have most beauty 

if my thought be wolvish thy hope may be as thy comparison be beastly 

I will thy word be as thy look be lovely 

I will thy look be as thy affection be blind 

fair face shall have smooth heart 

fresh flower have crooked root 

woman beauty will wane and then no art can make they fair 

man folly will ever wax and then what reason can make they wise 

to be amiable and not to love be like a paint lady to have colour and no life 

to be amorous and not lovely be like a pleasant fool full of word and no desert 

what call you desert what lovely 

no lovely thing than wit no great desert than patience 

have not I a excellent wit 

if thou think so thy self thou be a excellent fool 

fool no Celia thou shall find i as wise as I do thou proud and as little to digest thy taunt as thou to brook my love 

I think Montanus that you can not deserve when I tell you what it be patience 

sweet Celia I will be patient and forget this 

then want you wit that you can be content to be patient 

a hard choice if I take all well to be a fool if find fault than to want patience 

the fortune of love and the virtue be neither to have success nor mean farewell 

farewell nay I will follow and I know not how it come to pass disdain increase desire and the far possibility stand the near approach hope 

Polypus Niobe be ever of the colour of the stone it slick to and thou ever of his humour thou talk with 

find you fault that I love 

so many 

will you have i like none 

yes one 

who shall make choice but myself 

myself 

for another to put thought into my head be to pull the brain out of my head take not measure of my affection but weigh your own the oak find no fault with the dew because it also fall on the bramble believe i Silvestris the only way to be mad be to be constant poet make their wreathe of laurel lady of sundry flower 

sweet Niobe a river run into diverse brook become shallow and a mind divide into sundry affection in the end will have none what joy can I take in the fortune of my love when I shall know many to have the like favour turtle flock by couple and breed both joy and young one 

but bee in swarm and bring forth wax and honey 

why do you covet many that may find sweetness in one 

why have Argus a hundred eye and may have see with one 

because while he sleep with some he may wake with other some 

and I love many because be deceive by the inconstancy of diverse I may yet have one 

that be but a device of Juno that know Jupiter love 

and this a rule of Venus that know man lightness 

the whole heaven have but one sun 

but star infinite 

the rainbow be ever in one compass 

but of sundry colour 

a woman have but one heart 

but a thousand thought 

my lute though it have many string make a sweet consent and a lady heart though it harbour many fancy shall embrace but one love 

the string of my heart be tune in a contrary key to your lute and make as sweet harmony in discord as you in concord 

why what string be in lady heart not the base 

there be no base string in a woman heart 

the mean 

there be never mean in woman heart 

the treble 

yea the treble double and treble and so be all my heart string farewell 

sweet Niobe let we sing that I may die with the swan 

it will make you sigh the more and live with the Salamich 

be thy tune fire 

be you death 

no but when I have hear thy voice I be content to die 

I will sing to content thou 

inconstant Niobe unhappy Silvestris yet have I rather she shall rather love all then none for now though I have no certainty yet do I find a kind of sweetness 

cruel Nisa bear to slaughter man 

coy Celia breed up in skoftes 

waver yet witty Niobe but be we all meet 

yea and meet withal if your fortune be answerable to i for I find my mistress immovable and the hope I have be to despair 

Mine in pride intolerable who bid i look for no other comfort then contempt 

i be best of all and worst this be my hope that either she will have many or none 

I fear our fortune can thrive for Erisychthon have fell down the holy tree of Ceres which will increase in her choler and in her nymph cruelty let we see whether our garland be there which we hang on that tree and let we hang ourselves upon another 

a remedy for love irremovable but I will first see whether all those that love Niobe do like in the mean season I will content myself with my share 

here be the tree o mischief scarce to be believe in possible to be pardon 

pardon it be not for Erisychthon perish with famine and be able to starve those that look on he here hang our garland something be write read i 

cedit amor rebus res age tutus eris 

and i 

sit mihi si fancy sit bene nota mihi 
now for myself 
victoriatecum stabit scilicet 

you see their posy be as their heart and their heart as their speech cruel proud and waver let we all to the temple of Cupid and entreat his favour if not to obtain their love yet to revenge their hate Cupid be a kind god who know our unsported thought will punish they or release we we will study what revenge to have that our pain proceed of our own mind than plague may also proceed from they be you all agree 

I consent but what if Cupid deny help 

then he be no god 

but if he yield what shall we ask 

revenge 

then let we prepare ourselves for Cupid sacrifice

with this distaff have I spin that my exercise may be as womanish as my affection and so do Hercules and with this halter will I hang myself if my fortune answer not my desert and so do Iphis to thou divine Cupid I present not a bleed but a bloodless heart dry only with sorrow and wear with faithful service 
this picture toffer carve with no other instrument than love pity poor Montanus

I accept your offer not without cause and wonder at your love not without pleasure but be your thought as true as your word

I know that where my arrow light there breed love but shoot every minute a thousand shaft I know not on who heart they light though they fall on no place but heart what be your mistress 

Ceres maiden my most cruel which she call constancy 

my most fair but most proud 

my most witty but most waver 

be the one cruel the other coy the three inconstant 

too cruel 

too coy 

too fickle 

what do they think of Cupid 

one say he have no eye because he hit he know not who 

the other that he have no ear to hear those that call 

the three that he have no nose for savour be not find of lover 

all that he have no taste because sweet and sour be all one 

all that he have no sense because pain be pleasure and pleasure pain 

all that he be a foolish god work without reason and suffer the repulse without regard 

dare they blaspheme my godhead which jove do worship Neptune reverence and all the god tremble at to make they love be a revenge too gentle for Cupid to make you hate a recompense too small for lover but of that anon what have you use in love 

all thing that may procure love gift word oath sigh and swoon 

what say they of gift 

that affection can not be buy with gold 

what of word 

that they be golden blast out of leaden bellows 

what of oath 

that jupiter never swear true to Juno 

what of sigh 

that deceit keep a forge in the heart of fool 

what of swoon 

Nothing but that they wish they death 

what reason give they not to love 

woman reason they will not because they will not 

well then shall you see Cupid requite their reason with his rigour what punishment do you desire that Cupid will deny 

Mine be so hard as stone will I have turn to stone that be to lover pitiless she may to all the world be senseless 

Mine be so fair and so proud will I have turn into some flower that she may know beauty be as fade as grass which be fresh in the morning be wither before night 

my divine Cupid who affection nothing can make stay let she be turn to that bird that live only by air and die if she touch the earth because it be constant the bird of paradise Cupid that draw in her bowel nothing but air she may know her heart feed on nothing but fickleness 

your revenge be reasonable and shall be grant thou Nisa who heart no tear can pierce shall with continual wave be waste in stead of thy fair hair shall thou have green moss thy face of flint because thy heart be of marble thy ear shall be hole for fish who ear be more deaf than fish thou Celia who beauty make proud shall have the fruit of beauty that be to fade while it be flourish and to blast before it be blow thy face as fair as the damask rise shall perish like the damask rise the canker shall eat thou in the bud and every little wind blow thou from the stalk and then shall man in the morning wear thou in their hat and at night cast thou at their heel thou Niobe who nothing can please but that which most displease Cupid inconstancy shall only breathe and suck air for food and wear feather for silk be more waver than air and light than feather this will Cupid do therefore when next you shall behold your lady do but send a faithful sigh to Cupid and there shall arise a thick mist which Proserpina shall send and in the moment you shall be revenge and they change Cupid prove himself a great god and they peevish girl 

with what sacrifice shall we show ourselves thankful or how may we requite this benefit 

you shall yearly at my temple offer true heart and hourly bestow all your wit in love device think all the time lose that be not spend in love let your oath be without number but not without truth your word full of allure sweetness but not of broad flattery your attire neat but not womanish your gift of more price for the fine device than the great value and yet of such value that the device seem not beggarly nor yourselves blockish be secret that work miracle be constant that bring secrecy this be all Cupid do command away 

and to this we all willing consent 
now what rest but revenge on they that have practise malice on we let i be any thing see she will not be only i 

let we not now stand wish but present seek they out use as great speed in follow revenge as we do in pursue our love certain we shall find they about Ceres tree sing or sacrifice 

but shall we not go visit Erisychthon

I yield to death but with such delight that I will not wish to live unless it be to hear thy sweet lay

not yet come to myself or if I be I dare not credit my ear love thou divine goddess vouchsafe I may honour thou and live by the imagination I have of thy word and worthiness 

I be a goddess but a lady and a virgin who love if thou embrace thou shall live no less happy than the god in heaven

if thou listen to her word thou shall not live to repent for her malice be as sudden as her joy be sweet 

thy silver hair be not so precious as her golden lock nor thy crooked age of that estimation as her flower youth 

that old man measure the hot assault of love with the cold skirmish of age 

that young cruel resemble old ape who kill by cull from the top of this rock whereon she sit will she throw thou headlong into the sea who song be the instrument of her witchcraft never smile but when she mean to smite and under the flattery of love practise the shed of blood 

what be thou which so blaspheme this divine creature 

I be the ghost of Ulysses who continual hover about these place where this Siren haunt to save those which otherwise shall be spoil stop thy ear as I do i and succour the fair but by thy folly the most infortunate Protea 

Protea what do thou hear Petulius where be Protea

be this a Siren and thou Ulysses curse be that hellish carcase and bless be thy heavenly spirit 

I shrink my head for shame o Ulysses be it not enough for thou to escape but also to teach other sing and die nay die and never sing more

I will and only love Protea and never cease to wonder at Protea 

Cupid thou have transform my nymph and incense i they to shape unreasonable i to anger immortal for at one time I be both rob of my honour and my nymph 

Ceres thy nymph be stubborn and thyself speak so imperious to Cupid somewhat stately if you ask the cause in choler sic volo sic iubeo if in courtesy quae venu ex merito poena dolenda venit they be disdainful and have their desert thou Ceres do but govern the gut of man I the heart thou seek to starve Erisychthon with thy minister famine who his daughter shall preserve by my virtue love 

thou be but a god Cupid 

no Ceres but such a god as make thunder fall out of jove hand by throw thought into his heart and to be more terrify with the sparkle of a lady eye than man with the flash of his lightning such a god that have kindle more fire in Neptune bosom than the whole sea which he be king of can quench such power have I that Pluto never die fire do but scorch in respect of my flame Diana have feel some motion of love Vesta do Ceres shall 

be thou so cruel 

to those that resist a lion to those that submit a lamb 

can thou make such difference in affection and yet shall it all be love 

yea as much as between sickness and health though in both be life those that yield and honour Cupid shall possess sweet thought and enjoy please wish the other shall be torment with vain imagination and impossible hope 

how may my nymph be restore 

if thou restore Erisychthon they embrace their love and all offer sacrifice to i 

Erisychthon do in contempt hew down my sacred tree 

thy nymph do in disdain scorn my constant love 

he slay most cruel my chaste Fidelia who blood lie yet on the ground 

but Diana have change her blood to fresh flower which be to be see on the ground 

what honour shall he do to Ceres what amends can he make to Fidelia 

all Ceres grove shall he deck with garland and account every tree holy a stately monument shall he erect in remembrance of Fidelia and offer yearly sacrifice 

what sacrifice shall I and my nymph offer thou for I will do any thing to restore my nymph and honour thou 

you shall present in honour of my mother Venus grape and wheat for sine cerere & baccho friget Venus you shall suffer your nymph to play sometime to be idle in the favour of Cupid for otiasitollas periere cupidinis arcu so much for Ceres thy nymph shall make no vow to continue virgin nor use word to disgrace love nor fly from opportunity that kindle affection if they be chaste let they not be cruel if fair not proud if love not inconstant cruelty be for tiger pride for peacock inconstancy for fool 

Cupid I yield and they shall but sweet Cupid let they not be deceive by flattery which take the shape of affection nor by lust which be clothe in the habit of love for man have as many slight to delude as they have word to speak 

those that practise deceit shall perish Cupid favour none but the faithful 

well I will go to Erisychthon and bring he before thou 

then shall thy nymph recover their fame so as they yield to love 

they shall 

a strange discourse Protea by which I find the god amorous and virgin immortal goddess full of cruelty and man of unhappiness 

I have tell both my father misfortune grow by stoutness and i by weakness his thwart of Ceres my yield to Neptune 

I know Protea that hard iron fall into fire wax soft and then the tender heart of a virgin be in love must needs melt for what shall a fair young and witty lady answer to the sweet enticement of love but 

I have hear too that heart of man stiff than steel have by love be make soft than wool and then they cry 

man have often feign sigh 

and woman forge tear 

suppose I love not 

suppose I care not 

if man swear and lie how will you try their love 

if woman swear they love how will you try their dissemble 

the god put wit into woman 

and nature deceit into man 

I do this but to try your patience 

nor I but to prove your faith but see Petulius what miraculous punishment here be for desert in love this rock be a nymph to Ceres so be this rose so that bird 

all change from their shape 

all change by Cupid because they disdain love or dissemble in it 

a fair warn to Protea I hope she will love without dissemble 

a item for Petulius that he delude not those that love he for Cupid can also change man let we in 

This go lucky that Cupid have promise to restore our mistress and Ceres that they shall accept our love 

I do ever imagine that true love will end with sweet joy though so be begin with deep sigh 

but how shall we look on they when we shall see they smile we must and perchance they will frown 

push let we endure the bend of their fair brow and the scorch of their sparkle eye so that we may possess at last the depth of their affection 

possess never doubt it for Ceres have restore Erisychthon and therefore will persuade with they nay command they 

if it come by commandment of Ceres not their own motion I rather they shall hate for what joy can there be in our life or in our love sweetness when every kiss shall be seal with a curse and every kind word proceed of fear not affection enforcement be worse than enchantment 

be thou so superstitious in love that be wont to be most careless let they curse all day so I may have but one kiss at night 

thou be worse than Silvestris he not content without absolute love thou with indifferent 

but here come Ceres with Erisychthon let we look demure for in her heart she hate we deep 

I will hallow thy wood with solemn feast and honour all thy nymph with due regard 

well do so and thank Cupid that command nay thank my foolish nymph that know not how to obey here be the lover ready at receipt how now gentleman what seek you 

nothing but what Ceres will find 

Ceres have find those that I will she have lose vain lover 

Ceres may lose that that Cupid will save true lover 

you think so one of another 

Cupid know so of we all 

you may have make i a counsel of your love 

I madam if love will admit counsel 

Cupid here be Erisychthon in his former state restore my nymph to they then shall they embrace these lover who wither out their youth 

honour be mighty Cupid that make i live 

honour be mighty Cupid that make i love 

and i 

what more lover yet I think it be impossible for Ceres to have any follow she in one hour that be not in love in the next 

Erisychthon be thou careful to honour Ceres and forget not to please her nymph the faithful love of thy daughter Protea have wrought both pity in i to grant her desire and to release thy punishment thou Petulius shall enjoy thy love because I know thou loyal 

then shall Petulius be most happy 

and Protea most fortunate 

but do you Ramis continue your constant love and you Montanus and you Silvestris 

nothing can alter our affection which increase while the mean decrease and wax strong in be weaken 

then Venus send down that shower wherewith thou be wont to wath those that do thou worship and let love by thy beam be honour in all the world and fear wish for and wonder at here be thy nymph Ceres 

who do I see Nisa 

divine Celia fair than ever she be 

my sweet Niobe 

why stare you my nymph as amaze triumph rather because you have your shape this great god Cupid that for your pride and folly change have by my prayer and promise restore you 

you see lady what it be to make a mock of love or a scorn of Cupid see where your lover stand you must now take they for your husband this be my judgement this be Ceres promise 

happy Ramis 

happy Montanus 

happy Silvestris 

why speak you not nymph this must be do and you must yield 

not I 

nor I 

nor I 

not yield then shall Cupid in his fury turn you again to senseless and shameful shape 

will you not yield How say you Ramis do your love continue be your thought constant and you Montanus and you Silvestris 

my most unspotted 

and i 

and i Cupid which nothing can alter 

and will you not yield virgin 

not I Cupid neither do I thank thou that I be restore to life nor fear again to be change to stone for rather have I be wear with the continual beat of wave then dull with the importunity of man who open flattery make way to their secret lust retain as little truth in their heart as modesty in their word how happy be Nisa which feel nothing pine yet not feel the consumption unfortunate wench that now have ear to hear their cunning lie and eye to behold their dissemble look turn i Cupid again for love I will not 

miserable Ramis unhappy to love to change the lady accurse and now lose she desperate 

nor I Cupid well can I content myself to bud in the summer and to die in the winter for more good come of the rose then can by love when it be fresh it have a sweet favour love a sour taste the rose when it be old lose not his virtue love when it be state wax loathsome the rose distil with fire yield sweet water love in extremity kindle jealousy in the rose however it be there be sweetness in love nothing but bitterness if man look pale and swear and sigh then forsooth woman must yield because man say they love as though our heart be tie to their tongue and we must choose they by appointment ourselves feel no affection and so have our thought bind prentice to their word turn i again yield I will not 

which way shall thou turn thyself since nothing will turn her heart die Montanus with shame and grief and both infinite 

nor I Cupid let i hang always in the air which I find more constant than man word happy Niobe that touch not the ground where they go but always hold thy beak in the air do never turn back to behold the earth in the heaven I see a orderly course in the earth nothing but disorderly love and peevishness turn i again Cupid for yield I will not 

I will myself be stone flower or fowl see that Nisa have a heart hard than stone a face fair than the rose and a mind light than feather 

what have we here have punishment make you perverse Ceres I vow here by my sweet mother Venus that if they yield not I will turn they again not to flower or stone or bird but to monster no less filthy to be see than to be name hateful they shall creep that now stand and be to all man odious and be to themselves for the mind they shall retain loathsome 

my sweet nymph for the honour of your sex for the love of Ceres for regard of your own country yield to love yield my sweet nymph to sweet love 

shall I yield to he that practise my destruction and when his love be hot cause i to be change to a rock 

Nisa the extremity of love be madness and to be mad be to be senseless upon that rock do I resolve to end my life fair Nisa forgive he thy change that for himself provide a hard chance 

shall I yield to he that make so small account of my beauty that he study how he may never behold it again 

fair lady in the rose do I always behold thy colour and resolve by continual gaze to perish which I can not do when thou be in thy own shape thou be so coy and swift in fly from i 

shall I yield to he that cause i have wing that I may fly far from he 

sweet Niobe the far you do seem to be from i the near I be to my death which to make it more speedy wish thou wing to she into the air and myself lead on my heel to sink into the sea 

well my good nymph yield let Ceres entreat you yield 

I be content so as Ramis when he find i cold in love or hard in belief he attribute it to his own folly in that I retain some nature of the rock he change i into 

o my sweet Nisa be what thou will and let all thy imperfection be excuse by i so thou but say thou love i 

I do 

happy Ramis 

I consent so as Montanus when in the midst of his sweet delight shall find some bitter overthwart impute it to his folly in that he suffer i to be a rose that have prickle with her pleasantness as he be like to have with my love shrewdness 

let i bleed every minute with the prickle of the rose so I may enjoy but one hour the savour love fair Celia and at thy pleasure comfort and confound 

I do 

fortunate Montanus 

I yield first in mind though it be my course last to speak but if Silvestris find i not ever at home let he curse himself that give i wing to fly abroad who feather if his jealousy shall break my policy shall nip 

my sweet Niobe fly whither thou will all day so I may find thou in my nest at night I will love thou and belove thou 

I be glad you be all agree enjoy your love and every one his delight thou Erisychthon be restore of Ceres all the lover please by Cupid she joyful I honour now lady I will make such unspotted love among you that there shall be no suspicion nor jar no unkindness nor jealousy but let all lady hereafter take heed that they resist not love which work wonder 

I will charm my nymph as they shall neither be so stately as not to stoop to love nor so light as present to yield 

here be none but be happy but do not as Hippomanes do when by Venus aid he win Atlanta defile her temple with unchaste desire and forget to sacrifice vow I will soar up into heaven to settle the love of the god that in earth have dispose the affection of man 

I to my harvest who corn be now come out of the blade into the ear and let all this amorous troop to the temple of Venus there to consummate what Cupid have command 

in the honour of Cupid and Ceres will solemnize this feast within my house and learn if it be not too late again to love but you forester be unkind that in all my malady will not visit i 

thou know Erisychthon that lover visit none but their mistress 

well I will not take it unkind since all end in kindness 

let it be so these lover mind nothing what we say 

yes we attend on Ceres
