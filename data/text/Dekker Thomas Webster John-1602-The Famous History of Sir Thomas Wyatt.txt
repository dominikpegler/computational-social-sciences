yet for you be a counsellor of note 
one of our number and of high degree 
before we any way presume to judge 
we give you leave to speak in your behalf

can be conceal without great reproach

we have swear in presence of the sacred host of heaven 
unto our late young lord to both the duke 
that no impeachment shall divert our heart 
from the impeachment of the lady jane 
to this end we have cease she in the tower 
by public proclamation make her queen 
to this end we have arm the duke with power 
give they commission under our own hand 
to pass against the lady you perform in hostile manner 
and no doubt the spleen of the undaunted spirit 
of Northumber earl will not be call 
with write of repeal 
advice in this I hold it better far 
to keep the course we run then seek change 
hazard our life our heir and the realm 

in action rove from the bent of truth 
we have no precedent thus to persist 
but the bare name of worldly policy 
if other have ground from justice and the law 
as well divine as politic agree 
they be for no cause to be disinherit 
if you not seven year since to that effect 
swear to the father to maintain his seed 
what dispensation have acquit you 
from your first sacred vow 
you will say the will extort from a child 
o let mine eye in name that sweet youth 
observe their part 
pour down tear send from my swell heart 
God mother I term child but I will go on 
say that the will be he force by no trick

but strengthen by a act of parliament 
beside this sacred proof the princely maid 
have they no will nor act to prove their right 
have birthright no privilege be a plea so strong 
as can be refell but by plain wrong 
now be you touch the lady in tower 
alas she be innocent of my claim 
trust i she will think it a most happy life 
to leave a queen and keep a lady name 
and for the duke your warrant send they forth 
let the same warrant call they back again 
if they refuse to come the realm not they 
must be regard be strong and bold 
we be the people factor save our son 
from kill one another be afraid 
to tempt both heaven and earth so I have say 

why then give order that she shall be queen 
send for the mayor her error we will forget 
hope she will forgive 

never make doubt set her ceremonious order by 
she be pure within and mild chaste without 

give order to keep fast the lady jane 
dissolve the the counsel let we leave the tower and in the city hold our audience
