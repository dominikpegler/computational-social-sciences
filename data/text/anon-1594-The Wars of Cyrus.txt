you Persian Median and hircanian 
trusty assistant assister in this happy war 
you see the band power of Asia 
who number overspread the assyrian field 
and in their passage drink main river dry 
by favour of the god and our devoir 
be overthrow and scatter through the plain 
like autumn leave before a northern wind 
Croesus be foil and flee to Lydia 
the arabian prince be whelm amid the sand 
and last the old assyrian king be slay 
now triumph in the fortune of your hand 
who fame have direct these affair 

o Cyrus when I see the lydian king 
Croesus that dastard and reproach of Asia 
shine in armour forge of indian gold 
brave mount on a prancer of Eperus 
so shameful to forsake the field and fly 
I envy that so cowardly a king 
shall use so good a armour and a horse 

Chrisandas like to Croesus be our foe 
glorious in show but cowardly in mind 

Cyrus those arm which dastard Croesus be 
and horse of pride and courage past compare 
what heart so base that will deem to fight 
may I but live to back so brave a steed 

Croesus be go and go with he his steed 
this wish of you Chrisantas be in vain 
but of two hundred horse of my own 
of gallant race and courage singular 
take you the choice and furniture withal 
the bridle bite of massy silver wrought 
the boss gold the reins of persian silk 
the saddle all embroider purple work 
arm through with plate with fine engrave gold 
and golden trapper dangle to the ground 

so live my lord and flourish still 
as I regard this honourable gift 

now lord we have get the honour of the day 
and with our foot tread down the Thracian pride 
while I do sacrifice for victory 
and choose the holy altar of the god 
do you betwixt the army part the spoil 
and glad our man with fruit of our conquest 

what portion of the gold shall we reserve 
to be employ in your highness use 

araspas none for i divide it all 
it please i to see my soldier rich Exit Cyrus 

the persian horseman that do give the charge 
shall have five hundred talent for their share 

the Median that do enforce the fight 
and second the persian man at arm 
allot to they six hundred arm coat 

the archer of Hercania serve so well 
as not to give they payment with the rest 
be open wrong to their approve desert 

you know that in the sack of assyrian tent 
we find three thousand scythian bow in store 
finish with quiver ready to the field 
let they be lot to the hyrcanian part 

and truth Chrisantas you know well 
that bow and quiver agree with archer best 
Cyrus himself you see refuse gold 
and only seek to make his fellow rich 
what rest amid the conquer spoil 
wherein his highness may be gratify 

Histaspis there be a proud assyrian tent 
wherein the king be wont to sleep and banquet in 
I think if that be offer to his hand 
Cyrus will take it in most gracious part 

but be the pride and bravery thereof 
worthy to be present to our lord 

Asia have not see a rich prize 
the cover be of blue Sydoman silk 
embroider all with pearl and precious stone 
they glimmer bright than the sun itself 
on every point of the pavilion 
there stand a princely top of phoenix plume 
which trick with spangle and with silver belie 
and every gentle murmur of the wind 
delight the day with every harmony 
the stake wherewith it be fasten to the ground 
be massy silver of the pure proof 
the rope be all of crimson silk and gold 
hang from the top with wrist of ivory 
under a vine where Bacchus bruise grape 
and twenty cubit hover in the leaf 
believe i lord when I behold the thing 
the work appear so glorious to the eye 

araspas you describe a princely thing 
worthy to be present to a king 

and here be a tent though far from such a tent 
this shall be i the owner be flee or slay 

o beauty rare and more than mortal shape 
what goddess owe this earthly tabernacle 

Nicasia sing while Panthra sit and sigh

and well be he that may he his copere 
for fair he be and full of sweet demeanour 
pleasant sharp wise and liberal 
and be he not my son I will say more 
though his remembrance make i weep outright 

noble assyrian either leave to weep 
or speak no more Cyrus be full of ruth 
and when a man of thy estate lament 
he can choose but weep for company 
dry up these tear and tell the rest 

begin to grow familiar with my son 
and with he ride a hunt in the wood 
where first the hound put up a russet bear 
at which the king fling soon his hunt dart 
and miss but i throw and pierce his heart 
then sudden a lion do arise 
at who likewise he let his javelin fly 
and hit he not which when my son perceive 
he overthrow the lion as the bear 
which do say he twice have I throw and speed 
whereat the prince snatch from his page a spear 
and in a rage murder my guiltless son 
and that which grieve i more when he be dead

and i to weep upon his naked breast 
o judge my lord if you have have a son

as in a glass I see my slaughter son 

Gobrias thou have just cause to revolt 
and we to trust thy welcome unto we 
and for the thousand horse which thou have lose 
we will requite they with a great gift 
be thou lieutenant of the arcanian 

I humble thank your royal majesty 
and here in presence of the persian lord 
adopt you heir of all my province 
my hold and castle village and town 
conditional that I may be revenge 
on this archtyrant murderer of my son 
save one daughter I have never a child 
and she endue with jewel plate and gold 
shall be bestow as you my lord think best 

assyrian I have captain worthy here 
she shall be match as beseem a princess bear 
and for revenge upon the assyrian king 
we will gird in Babylon with our high host 
or either starve they with a linger siege 
or rip his bowel with our persian sword 
but in the mean time frolic in our tent 
Histaspis lead the assyrian to our camp 
and entertain he as beseem a prince 
Armuchus and Chrisantus follow he 
araspas as I late give in charge 
be all the spoil divide equal 

it be my lord and every soldier please 
where be enclose a jewel of such worth 
as Asia hardly can afford the like 
the susian king stout abradates queen 
a woman so rich embellish 
with beauty and perfection of the mind 
as never any mortal creature be 
her hair as radiant as be Tagis sand 
and soft than the stream on which it run 
her lily cheek all die with ruddy blush 
cast such reflection to the stander by 
as do the union of ten thousand sun 
through her transparent neck the air do play 
and make it fair than a crystal glass 
and from her eye it seem nature herself 
bid every star receive his proper light 
for with her glance she cast such a brightness 
as make the night more bright than the day 
and day more fair than be Eliziur 
but when she talk so pleasant be her voice 
as be she black than the pitchy night 
she will entice the hard Massaget 
or wild Scythian in your highness camp 
and when she look upon you be she dumb 
her beauty be in stead of eloquence 
and have she neither loveliness nor wit 
the harmony she make will ravish you 
she weep and play while both her handmaid sing 
and sigh at every strain use that note 
which Orpheus sing for eruditus 
with wringed hand her wait maid keep time 
upon their mournful breast as be we flint 
we can not choose but melt to hear their song 
wherefore my lord comfort this captive dame 
and with your presence comfort her distress 

araspas will thou have i visit she 
when by her beauty I may be enthrall 

your grace may look on she and yet not love 

do thou not think that love be violent 

nay rather voluntary my gracious lord 
you know that woman beauty be like fire 
and fire do always burn each thing alike 
therefore if nature be of such great power 
shall every man by beauty be inflame 
but beauteous thing be not in equal power 
for some love that which other do abstain 
either for fear or love to prove this true 
the sister of the brother be not love 
the daughter of the father not desire 
and yet some one love any of they both 

if love be voluntary as thou say 
why can lover leave it when they will 

they may 

have you not see they weep and wail for death 
empty their purse of coin their brain of wit 
send both gift and letter to their love 

they yield too much unto affection 
it be folly and not beauty make they die 

man be in folly when they be in love 
urge i no more I will not visit she 
for by the eye love slip into the heart 
make man idle negligent 
nothing can more dishonour warrior 
then to be conquer with a woman look 
araspas I resign my part to thou 
thou shall be keeper of that Susan queen 
use she as fit a woman of such birth 
excuse i for not come to her tent 
bid she be merry with her sing maid 
and say that Cyrus will entreat her fair exeunt 

Antiochus king of Assiria 
so lord of Euphrates and Babylon 
how long will thou lament thy father death 
cast off those mourn weed 

how long will I lament my father death 
until proud Persia weep for Cyrus death 

o that will never be Cyrus be strong 
so strong my lord that be not Babylon 
fortify with victual for twenty year 
guard with soldier that will never yield 
soon will he expel you from your seat 
than you with open arm can anger he 

what be revenge but open war 
as be Antiochus a private man 
and one of you king of Assyria 
I will not fail to work his overthrow 
but you that be not touch with inward grief 
will not in that attempt be resolute 

vouchsafe oh lord to tell i what it be 
if I attempt it not then let i die 

why this it be feign I have injure thou 
and offer service to the persian king 
then be receive as late Gobrias be 
how easy may thou slay he and escape 
for in the night he walk about his camp 
without a guard even as a common man 

yet he that kill he sure be to die 

I think the fear of death will daunt he quite 
a thousand talent will I free give 
to he that undertake this enterprise 

my lord I be resolve give i the gold 
and I will venture life in this exploit 

my treasurer at arm shall give it thou 
and Ctesifon when I receive his head 
beside this sum thou shall have annual pay 
as much as thy revenue mount unto 
and where thou be by call but a knight 
I will make thou lord of many province 

as for the gold keep it till I return 
and if I die deliver it to my friend 

well Ctesiphon manage this glorious act 
let i embrace he ere I take my leave 

fare well my lord now you assyrian god 
to who we sacrifice our foeman blood 
give favour to my look faith to my speech 
that be gracious with the persian lord 
by i Assyria may be free from band 
and both the king and subject death revenge 

fare well brave mind Ctesiphon 

while this be do we will march from hence 
unto the country where Gobrias dwell 
he have a castle well replenish 
with victual man and furniture 
and as our spy give we to understand 
his only daughter stay within the hold 
not know of her father late revolt 
therefore will we surprise she unaware 
and thou shall be lieutenant in his stead 
when we have make his soldier yield the fort 

must I confess that love be violent 
by dote on my captive Panthea 
I will not love I will bridle those affect 
it can be resist I must yield 
o what a tyrant be this cruel love 
that drink my blood and make i pale and wan 
that suck my spirit and make i weak and faint 
that tear my heart and make i almost dead 
that revel in my brain and make i mad 
I be a soldier and will conquer love 
I will mount i straight give i a horseman staff 
proud love sit fast for now araspas run 
run and scarce stand oh Panthea 
thou set my idle fantasy thus a work 
and make i speak and think I know not what 
I will I may forget fair Panthea 
I can name she but I must say fair 
and that word fair make i remember she 
Panthea be ugly black ill favour fowl 
and who be so beautiful as she 
and I must weep for this misterm she 
why shall I weep ask I the reason why 
I have abuse my love weep not but die 
die not but live and enjoy thy love 
what contrariety consist in my word 
o reconcile they lovely Panthea 
thy look have make i lunatic 

I have intelligence that our lord be sick 
we come to comfort he as captive may 

o welcome Panthea shall I tell my grief 

sit still my lord 
why change you colour thus what trouble you 

Something stand by and whisper in my ear 
a kiss of Panthea will recover i 

o leave these idle word they make you worse 

nay they recover i I be half well 

so say they that be go from the world 

Panthea sit down but sit so Panthea 
as I may view thy face or else I die 

Nicasia command the music play 
it may be music will allay the fit 

Nicasia cause the music cease music play 
for it be harsh and mar the harmony 
come Panthea sit down by i and let we talk 

talk be nought turn you about and sleep 

o love 

how now my lord a soldier and lovesick 

I can keep it in it burst my heart 
for thou sweet Panthea be araspas sick 

for i my lord 

fling not away celestial Panthea 
though I be half dead I shall follow thou 

the air will hurt thou whither will thou go 

where Panthea go o frown not my fair love 

then love i not else I will more than frown 

what will a captive woman threat her love 

o give poor Panthea leave to threat herself 
I mean my tragedy shall end the love 

no lovely queen I will rather end my love 
then anger Panthea much less leather die 
and yet God know my love can never end 
be infinite in measure and in time 

what word be these that cut my ear with grief 
o Abradates little do thou know 
what misery poor Panthea do sustain 
wicked araspas perish in thy love Exit Panthea 

can I win she oh unhappy man 
araspas thou want eloquence to woo 
against chastity no eloquence prevail 
it be because I offer she no gift 
she be a queen what gift can compass she 
I shall have court she with better word 
but here do love and threaten disagree 
nothing but magic can obtain her love 
if magic will than Panthea shall be i 

Chrisantas when I look into the life 
the manner deed and quality of mind 
the graveness power and imperial part 
wherewith young Cyrus be so full adorn 
my thought foresee that he be ordain of God 
to enlarge the limit of the persian reign 

Histaspis rare it be to see those year 
so furnish with such rare experience 
as be not common in the grey hair 
beside his body have of these rare gift 
use to labour hunger thirst and cold 
give true foretoken that the prince will prove 
a famous warrior and a conqueror 

and of the sundry virtue that abound 
daily increase in her princely breast 
religion to the god exceed they all 

and reason good for of all humane work 
the care of they shall chief be prefer 

be this assyrian friend or foe to we 
that dare approach so near the persian camp 

in bend of my spear to Babylon 
and break it against the assyrian ground 
I come a friend not foe to Cyrus camp 

what reason move thou a assyrian bear 
to bear such rancour to thy country soil 

that secret I reserve for Cyrus ear 
unto who secret favour I submit 
my person honour fortune fame and life 

inform the king certain I will 
oh Persian true fortunate be you 
under subjection of so sweet a prince 
that measure all the action of his life 
by mercy justice and respect of right 

it seem the assyrian prince have injure this man 
with some notorious great indignity 

man of Assyria what will thou with i 

o gracious lord great and invincible 
receive into protection of your grace 
a wretched man undo by tyranny 
and lawless rigour of a cruel prince 

what prince be he that thou accuse thus 

the new assyrian king a man distain 
with endless mark of villainy and blood 

descend unto the purpose of thy tale 
and make thy state and fortune plain at once 

I be I be say I I be a man 
erst noble now banish reprobate 
high in favour with the assyrian prince 
till sensual rage of his unbridle lust 
do lay my state and honour in the dust 
and thus great lord begin my tragedy 
one only virgin daughter have your thrall 
of year incline now to marriage state 
her face and beauty if I seem not vain 
be equal to the best assyrian dame 
and she suppose the flower of Babylon 
the bruit of which her rare perfection run 
swift than fame through all the assyrian land 
and last rest in the prince ear 
who wound with report of beauty pride 
unable to restrain his darn desire 
a trended by a band of arm man 
invade my castle when I be at rest 
and bear my daughter thence with violate hand 
unto his palace where she do remain 
as concubine allot to his bed 
strive her desperate honour to preserve 
I come in frantic sort to Babylon 
exclaim on this villainous despite 
band the prince with many a bitter view 
my just complaint when once he understand 
he sort i out a damn bloody crew 
of rustian swearer murderer and thief 
profess man for gain and lucre sake 
to make no conscience who they slay and kill 
those man by solemn oath have vow my life 
a sacrifice unto their curse sword 
and hour by hour they seek to reave my soul 
live in hazard of continual death 
I know no home for i at Babylon 
other than my grave and doomless sepulchre 
and so for refuge to my wretched life 
I have abandon country friend and all 
and prostrate my estate at Cyrus foot 
oh puissant lord who great and conquer sword 
be forge by Mars and make for victory 
protect the life of thy unhappy thrall 
and make he follower of the persian arm 
that in the fortune of thy mighty hand 
the fall of Ctesiphon may be revenge 

o Ctesiphon this tale of thou revive 
the woeful memory of my dear son 
slaughter by that most barbarous tyrant hand 

Gobrias you have hear the assyrian tale 
what great complaint he make against the prince 
and those not causeless if his word be true 
now Cyrus be not rash credulous 
nor bind his faith on every stranger vow 
tell i Gobrias do thou simple think 
that this discourse be nought but naked truth 
or else some forge or dissemble gloze 
to sound our secret and bewray our drift 

Cyrus the disposition of this prince 
sell up and swear to endless villainy 
may prove the grief of Ctesiphon unfeigned 
upon my conscience Cyrus trust the man 
no doubt his sorrow and complaint be true 

o Cyrus so it please the immortal god 
how happy be thy servant if his word 
proceed from a vain dissemble tongue 
so be my daughter honour undefiled 
and Ctesiphon her father not exile 

be valiant Ctesiphon and follow i

be I become a vow friend to Cyrus health 
and in that resolution press to die 

live long to wail for thy pretend ill 
as free from punishment as for reward 
the life of king be guard by the god 
nor be they in the hand of mortal man 
assyrian though thy sword be at my breast 
the jealous angel that attend on we 
will snatch it from thy hand and fling it down 
and therefore muse not at this accident 

see knightly Cyrus be thus merciful 
vouchsafe this service at thy vassal hand 
give i but letter from your majesty 
to signify how fain you will have peace 
and draw your legion from Assyria 
and bear they unto Antiochus 
in the delivery I will murder he 
so high do I honour Cyrus name 
so vild think on base Antiochus 

thou shall have letter to the assyrian king 
free liberty to pass from this our camp 
and conduit money from our treasury 
attend our leisure I will send thou straight 
what virgin be it that Gobrias lead 

my daughter mighty Cyrus and your child 
for I commit she to your patronage 

then princely virgin welcome to our camp 
but why sigh you why hang you down the head 
and in your pale look bury beauty pride 
it be pity these look shall be stain with tear 

Even as a dove late rifle by the eagle 
who breast be taint with his fork talent 
so stand poor Alexandra terrify 
and almost dead to think of her escape 
if thou be Cyrus of who Asia ring 
rescue oh rescue poor Libanio 

from who fair madam shall I rescue he 

o from Antiochus that bloody king 
who when he hear my father serve your grace 
besiege his fortress with his man at arm 
where only i and that Libanio stay 
by who I live for when the hold be lose 
he be bondman and of a base birth 
will needs constrain i to put on his weed 
and he disguise as I be wont to go 
will be Gobrias daughter in my stead 
and so be think of king Antiochus 
and all the noble of his warlike camp 
but I a bondman and at his request 
who care be only to preserve my life 
send hither as a messenger from he 
to will my father who they think my lord 
to leave your camp and come to Babylon 
or else Libanio his belove child 
shall die for his so traitorlike revolt 
and die he must lest gyrus give he life 

the deed be full of honour and deceit 
if gold will pay his ransom he shall live 
and therefore Alexandra be not sad 

so shall Gobrias beat Cyrus beck 
and for his sake make lavish of his blood 

and when they know how he delude they 
I fear they will rate his ransom at his head 

then blood and death Bellona wait maid 
shall ghastly march babylon waste street 
and never be a bondmans death revenge 
as Cyrus mean for this Libanio 

give i the charm for now do Panthea sleep 
if it prevail this jewel shall be thou 

doubt not the operation of this charm 
for I have try it on Diana nymph 
and make her wanton and lascivious 
if Panthea be a goddess she must yield 

but tell i first how must it be apply 
and in what time will it begin to work 

lay it under the pillow of her bed 
and in a hour it will make she wake and yield 

I will now favour i infernal Jove 

So wake she not till she begin to smile 
now love begin to seat he in her brain 

a way I will not you be impudent 

tell i magician what import this speech 

why now she think some solicit she 

you be deceive I be not beautiful 

o give i leave to court she in her sleep 
it may be when she wake she will not love 

soft araspas if you talk she wake 

o let she wake I long to talk with she 

now begin her eye to open and she stir 

stand thou aside until I call for thou 

what dream and fond illusion have I have 
how come this word love in Panthea mind 
I love nay rather will I die then love 
and yet against my will I think on love 
oh Panthea think upon thy funeral 
for thou be wither with excessive grief 
love and deformity can agree 

if Panthea be fair and beautiful 
then love and Panthea do well agree 

araspas Panthea and herself will jar 
when she shall yield to love or what be love 
but gall and aloe to my martyr soul 
now Abradates be not in my sight 

here be araspas lovely Panthea 
for thou I will leave the field then leave thou he 
for thou I will leave the world then love thou i 
let Cyrus joy in pomp and empery 
suffice i to conquer fair Panthea 
let other glory in their ground and gold 
Panthea to i be twenty thousand world 
and without Panthea all the world be trash 

for thou araspas will I curse my star 
that suffer thou so to solicit i 
for thou I will count the world as hell 
except thou leave thus to solicit i 

how figurative be Panthea in her speech 
resemble cunning rhetorician 
who in the person of some one decease 
persuade their auditor to what they please 
I can think that these be Panthea word 
she be so fair to give so sharp reply 
but if these be the word of Panthea 
then must she change her face and seem less fair 
for know that beauty be love harbinger 
then be beauteous Panthea needs must love 

will I be change into some other shape 
that I may fright thou with my hideous look 
I in the person of myself decease 
protest this heart shall never harbour love 
but if my look be this preparative 
I will beat my face against the hapless earth 
or deep harrow it with these my tremble hand 
which I hold up to heaven to change thy mind 
or hasten death to rid i from this suit 

nay then if amorous court will not serve 
know whether thou will or not I will make thou yield 

though fortune make i captive yet know thou 
that Panthea will can never be constrain 

but torment can enforce a woman will 

then shall thy importunity enforce 
the sight of thou araspas shall constrain 
for I protest before the god of heaven 
no torment can be great in my thought 

ay say so till you feel they Panthea 

I feel more torment than thou can invent 
who add the more shall ease that I sustain 
all torment be they never so exquisite 
be but ascend step unto my end 
and death tu Panthea be a benefit 
what be thy threat but sugar promise 

then shall thou live and I will importune thou 

ay now be Panthea menace to the proof 
yet every word thou speak shall wound my heart 
and in despite of thou I will die at last 
the earnest thou be the soon too 
but to prevent it thus I will fly from thou 
Cyrus shall know Araspus villainy 

thus therefore shall I pine abandon love 
oh it be inherent to araspas soul 
and thereby claim a immortality 
so it shall never begin nor never end 
a curse magician be these thy wicked spell 

o pardon i my honourable lord 
for Panthea virtue frustrate all my art 

must magic yield to virtue wherefore then 
do thou assure i she shall be in love 

So be she be asleep as do appear 

and why not be wake speak villain speak 

reason my lord be the predominant 
her intellectual part strive against love 
and magic can command the soul 
while appetite and common sense remain 
you see I make her smile embrace the air 
and show the affect of amorous conceit 
few woman use to skirmish with such thought 
and have this Panthea be at liberty 
she will have yield to your honour suit 
but in captivity be nought but grief 
and love with grief will keep no residence 

smooth be thy word but rough and harsh thy sense 
for they import Panthea can be force 
can thou with incantation make she die 
that she be go my love may follow she 

life be adjunct unto our human form 
exempt from magic and magician 
and that be the cause we soon hurt brute beast 
than such as have the semblance of ourselves 

deceitful artisan thy word be sleight 
thy word deceitful and full of guile 
wit be a witch sweet word must conquer she 
out of my sight yet conceal this attempt 
if thou bewray it maugre all thy skill 
this sword shall send thou to eternal hell 

now be we at the bank of Euphrates 
far from the camp where soldier haunt 
and here may we under this poplar shade 
discourse upon the sweetness of our love 

you know my lord I be too young to love 

fair Alexandra if thou love not i 
thou be compact of adamant and iron 
thy year be fit for love so be thy look 

how fit soever my year be and my look 
I Alexandra be unfit to love 
be not my father with the persian king 
and I Alexendra as captive in his stead 
and give i leave to wail my hard estate 
and make a river with my flow tear 
that mingle with the stream of Euphrates 
may swift run unto my father seat 
and make he haste to great Antiochus 

nay rather sit upon this ledgy bank 
that I see thy shadow in the stream 
may feed my fancy with thy pleasant view 
if not enjoy the sweetness I desire 
and leap into the wave and drown myself 
that thou may pity Dinon be dead 

o I can pity Dinon be alive 
but that I fear my father will not come 
and then shall Alexandra suffer death 
and be dead Dinon may pity i 

love may I call thou love lo she do not frown 
her look give warrant for that appetite 
for thou I will kneel before Antiochus 
and rather than thou shall be touch by he 
I will bear thou hence as far as Tanais 
or keep thou close in these assyrian wood 

no place be secret to Antiochus 
do thou not know that king have reach hand 

I do yet know my sword be sharp and keen 
which when I draw and brandish in the air 
all Babylon will fight in my avail 
who honour i more than Antiochus 
I will not say how great thy dowry shall be 
nor boast what city I command 
let this though not a king in name 
in wealth and friend I be a emperor 

if I shall yield your honour may suppose 
that dignity and wealth shall conquer i 
therefore I blush to say I love my lord 

and when thou blush Dinon heart be fire 
therefore to quench it give a gentle grant 

my honour be preserve my grant be give 

thereof be I as chary as thyself 
and of thy love as of my proper life 
oh Alexandra thy word ravish i 
lull i asleep with sweetness of thy voice 

then shall my song be of my Dinon praise 
sleep Dinon than Libanio draw thy sword 
and manly thrust it in his slumber heart 
there be no way to save thy life but this 
and therefore fear not shall I slaughter he 
that entertain i with such amorous word 
such bounteous gift and golden promise 
when he shall know I be Libanio 
and go I can but I shall be take 
unless I slay he in his hapless sleep 
for he will quick wake and follow i 
now Dinon die alas I can strike 
this habit make i over pitiful 
Remember that thou be Libanio she kill he 
no woman but a bondman strike and fly 

now that Gobrias fortress be our own 
his daughter prisoner and his country burn 
let we march from hence to wealthy Babylon 
and muster those resolve citizen 
to meet the persian in the open field 
twice have he lead his force by our gate 
yet never dare to mount his batter ram 
or warlike engine against the rampired wall 
therefore we he no more in garrison 
but bustle out and fight for liberty 

my lord behold where Dinon slaughter lie 

Dinon thou be decide it be not he 

it be my lord I know he by his scar 

these scar be give he in my father day 
and now he be dead ere I can guerdon he 
the great honour I can do thou now 
be to lament and kiss thy liveless cheek 
and that will I perform for Dinon sake 
oh that I can revive thou with this kiss 

doubtless Gobrias daughter murder he 
I see they in the morning walk abroad 
and since they never return into the camp 

then she have do this execrable fact 
and so be flee unto her traitorous sire 
oh that a silly maid shall slaughter he 
which not a world of Persian can subdue 
be there no end of my calamity 
my father do to death by Cyrus sword 
wicked Gobrias and his daughter flee 
false Ctesiphon resolve to murder i 
and now Dinon my chief captain slay 
why run we not upon these persian 
which be the author of these misery 
Come soldier take he up and march away 
we will empty Babylon to meet our foe 
and be revenge unto the nine degree 
both of Gobrias and his family exeunt 

o Cyrus if the fortune of thy hand 
have turn my freedom to captivity 
and of a queen make i a captive dame 
yet think that virtue be not thrall to chance 
nor honour subject to unhappy time 
but like a gallant consecrate ship 
that in extreme wrath and storm of sea 
vaunt all her sail and fight the battle out 

madam the reason of these vehement term 
Cyrus do neither know nor can conject 
it since the time of your captivity 
you have not be entreat as you ought 
the god can tell it be far against my thought 

then know my great lord the man that take the charge 
to guard my honour and my person free 
long since dote on my person so 
that dote he have seek my honor wreak 
a tedious siege God know I have endure 
more hedious unto i then hasty arm 
while vild araspas with his lewd desire 
ceaseless solicit my unlawful bed 
without repulse I have quail his hope 
which he renew with charge of fresh assault 
but my denial make his purpose vain 
in fine when no entreaty can prevail 
to frame my fancy to his wicked will 
he fall to threaten from persuasion term 
and vow to purchase his desire by force 
and therefore Cyrus as thou be a king 
protect a lady honour from the spoil 
and let thy bondmaid live and die unstained 
and if there rest no other hope for i 
but havoc wreck and ruin of my fame 
oh Cyrus on thy sword let Panthea die 
and so prevent the danger of my shame 

lady how far your usage disagree 
from Cyrus meaning record be the god 
as for myself not vain be it say 
I hold my eye in bondage to my will 
and keep my thought in yoke to reason love 
my sight on beauty never surfeit 
and where her beam be likely to infect 
my judgement be a veil before my eye 
to bear such pierce fancy from my heart 
such as I be such must my follower be 
else let they pack they shall not follow i 
the man that offer to dishonour you 
shall be so thorough chastise for his fault 
as you shall rest sufficient revenge 
and knowledge i a gracious conqueror 
Histaspis carry she to your pavilion

to do you further service ere he die 

Gobrias go your page in that attire

some shameless strumpet and lascivious trull 

And have my lord forget his servant then

to who desert and courage I ascribe 
the rescue of my daughter liberty

in fearful doubt and hazard of his life 
to save her honour from the tyrant wrath 

my boy whatever thy birth and fortune be 
great do this mind and thought of honour taste 
express mark of true nobility 
and to excite thou to commend work 
which be the path that to advancement lead 
receive this chain of gold from Cyrus neck 
and wear it in the face of all the world 
not as a favour to thy person give 
but as in honour to thy virtuous mind 

great and surpass be the kingly grace 
yea far beyond the compass of my hope 
god grant i life and fortune to deserve 
this part of bounty at your royal hand 

Libanio then I have not pray in vain 
nor call upon the god with frustrate vow 
if thou once more be render to my sight

This mean I find and please my lord and king

that wake sleep or whatever else 
he feel a restless combat in his thought 
in fine more safe to commence his love 
he lead i quite beyond the assyrian camp 
and bring i to the bank of Euphrates 
there sit we down and he with amorous plea 
not only fill but cloy my weary ear 
so far that what with long continue talk 
and heat of sun reflect on the bank 
or happily with the rattle harmony 
which Euphrates his glide stream do keep 
which see I imagine that the god 
have offer this occasion to my hand 
for sweet recovery of my freedom 
short tale to make with dreadful hand I draw 
the sword that hang loose dangle by his side 
and with the full of my extend force 
I sheathe it home amid the owner rib

Gobrias have a honourable care 

Libanio now leave Alexandra weed 
that part be play and be yourself again 
that part poor boy with danger thou have play 

madam no danger can be so great 
that I will refuse for Alexandra sake 

Gobrias say be Alexandra she

my lord and king I bear no bloody sword 
nor stain with gore of Persian Cyrus heart 
a prince he be far from delight in blood 
mild lovely virtuous wise and bountiful 
able to reconcile his great foe 
and make great prince of his mean friend 

thy go be to compass Cyrus death 
how hap thy purpose end without effect 

the persian prince incline to term of truce 
and crave the friendship of Antiochus 
so please my lord the king to firm a peace 
for brief whereof his letter I present 
sign and deliver with his royal hand 
sincere tend to the same effect 
whereto if once your highness condescend 
he will withdraw his army from Assyria 
and on the covenant seal dissolve his camp 

in case the persian prince be so incline 
thy answer shall less offend my mind 
this bearer come to my camp arm with resolution to kill i and entreat more honourable then either his treachery or thou can deserve apprehend Ctesiphon 

what read my lord aright or do he feign 

that you shall know before you start again 
upon the instant purpose of his enterprise it please God to confound he with such horror of conscience that unconstrained he confess the treason and entreat pardon vow himself so far forth friend to Cyrus that for his sake he will kill Antiochus I be content to soothe the man in his villainy because I will have thou know the difference betwixt a open so and a dissemble friend I give thou this notice not because I love thou or regard thy life but because a villain shall not triumph in the murder of he who I account a honourable conquest of myself reward he accord to his merit and prepare to fight with i for thy own honour farewell 

these thankless persian who I spare from death 
requite i with the betray of my life 

what answer make traitorous Ctesiphon 

o prince my guilt be plain before my face 
and witness with a prince seal 
to slande upon denial be but vain 
where open proof convict i of offence 
I say no more but prostrate at your foot 
submit myself to mercy of my lord 

such mercy as to traitor do belong 
such and no better Ctesiphon shall find 
disarm he of his martial habiliment 
disgrade he of all title of regard 
and then refer his attachment to your prince 

this coat of arm the badge of honour win 
through praise and virtue of thy ancestor 
we rent it from that traitorous back of thou 
and as a honour stain with villainy 
in deep disdain we stamp it under foot 

this sword that once be gird unto thy side 
to be employ in service of thy prince 
now vow to gore the bowel of his grace 
we break it here upon thy traitorous head 

these square of knighthood that present the pride 
and honour due to chivalry and arm 
who prick shall force the proud courageous steed 
with thunder race to break the rider lance 
thus do we hew they from thy traitorous heel 

thou be no man of honour nor of arm 
thou have no title of gentility 
nor style of honour leave hereof to vaunt 
but be become inferior of regard 
then be the base bondman of Assyria 
or vile slave that haunt the lydian dame 

dishonour traitor now prepare thyself 
to yield thy head unto the hangman axe 

not fate but my demerit make i die 
oh now I find niltutum proditor exeunt 

I fear the fury of the persian prince 
Histaspis Cyrus fury I do fear 

and wrath of prince what be it but death 
araspas on my honour make a proof 
and never shun the presence of our lord 
a prince he be most mild and merciful 
soon mollify with vow and penitence 
and though with great impatience he endure 
your threaten violence to the Susan queen 
yet your submission and desire of grace 
will pierce he with compassion of your suit 
and purchase pardon at his royal hand 

o spiteful beauty that bewitch my mind 
and lead my fancy to such foul extreme 
I will assay the mercy of my lord 
and yield my life to hazard of his grace 

and doubt not but of Cyrus you shall find 
a pitiful and pass gracious prince 

Histaspis and the rest with draw yourselves 
only araspas stay behind with i 

my sovereign lord in tremble fear I stay 
and prostrate fall before your highness foot 
the frail affect and error of my youth 
enforce through folly of a wanton will 
have cast my life in peril of your wrath 
blind with charm of beauty I have fall 
and make my judgement subject to desire 
and in pursuit of love unbridle rage 
I have transgress the bound of honour law 
oh gracious lord impute my error past 
unto the power of proud command love 
that lead my mind and thought so far astray 
forgive those frailty of my youth oh king 
and take your servant once again to grace 
with fear of your displeasure almost slay 

force to a queen and she a captive too 
a persian lord so far mislead with lust 
intend dishonour to a silly dame 
araspas they that will be conqueror 
shall chief learn to conquer their desire 
lest while they seek dominion over other 
they prove but slave and bondman to themselves 
now where be those your big and brave dispute 
wherein you plead love be voluntary 
and fancy leave and entertain at will 
when you embrace it in such rage heat 
that where entreaty fail of your desire 
you fall from vow to violence with the dame 
araspas for the excuse of this offence 
you find no precedent in Cyrus life 

I know and grant my lord the prince abound 
with peerless gift and grace of the mind 
wherewith the god have fill his kingly breast 
there nought but virtuous motion take root 
nothing but honour harbour in that seat 
and holy thought direct his royal deed 
that so his grace may every way be find 
worthy the glory of so high a charge 
yet since these frailty that disgrace your thrall 
be humane fault and incident to mind 
where strong desire hold reason under yoke 
the wont mercy of my lord the prince 
so prone in favour to the penitent 
may mitigate the shame of this my fault 
with sweet compassion to his prince thrall 

araspas I remit thou this amiss 
although blame worthy in the high degree 
and for your try desert in martial praise 
I be content this folly to forget 
yet will I have it seem unto the world 
that my displeasure make you fly from i 
and so revolt to the assyrian arm 
there this suppose shall make you entertain 
and high favour of that graceless king 
by mean whereof full safe you may learn 
the garrison and strength of Babylon 
the utmost force and puissance of our foe 
with every purpose of Antiochus 
the time and place where he intent to fight 
then have learn the full of every thing 
in secret you may escape again to i 
with just relation of the Assyrian camp 
this service if you please to undertake 
you shall effect a singular good turn 
and reap mortal thank at Cyrus hand 

no long let araspas live and breath 
then with the utmost venture of his life 
he will perform what Cyrus shall command 
and sacred price for this extend grace 
though in the compass of this hard affair 
I leave the assyrian faction to maintain 
yet vow to bear a trusty persian heart 

then go with fortune and return with health 
and grant the god this enterprise of thou 
may end and prosper with desire effect 

and grant the god that Cyrus still may live 
happy in peace and in arm victorious 

to pacify the angry Panthea mood 
I will persuade she of araspas flight 
that he be revolt to the assyrian king enter Panthea 

ready the humble handmaid of my lord 

to calm the heat of your offend mind 
thus have I lose as brave a warrior 
as ever tread upon the persian field 

what warrior mean my lord and conqueror 

araspas who in fear of my displeasure 
I flee from i unto the assyrian camp 
and have forsake the persian colour quite 
thus madam for your sake have Cyrus do 
even lose the worthy soldier of his band 

Cyrus let not his loss perplex your mind 
if you will let i send a messenger 
unto my lord and husband Abradates 
I know for these your princely favour do 
to i his wife in this my captive plight 
he will attend your fortune in the war 
with more sincere affection love and zeal 
then ever that ungracious person do 
again my lord my husband be a knight 
as forward tread and fortunate in arm 
as ever spread his colour in the field 

be it likely abradatus will forsake 
his native prince to follow for rain arm 

the father of this king by Cyrus slay 
be high love and honourde of my lord 
this now that reign affect Panthea bed 
seek to procure a most unjust divorce 
betwixt my best belove lord and i 
who therefore bear he a immortal hate 
the star of which incurable despite 
remain so deep imprint in his thought 
that ten time bless will he think himself 
to find a fit occasion for revenge 

believe i madam if your lord be arm 
with such sore ground malice to the prince 
his help may great further my affair 
and therefore if you can procure the man 
to stand assistant to the persian arm 
you shall deserve great thanks at Cyrus hand 

Cyrus I will presume to make my lord 
a trusty follower of the persian arm 
and he your highness shall not fail to find 
a noble friend and valiant gentleman 

and madam he shall want at Cyrus hand 
no praise nor honour due to good desert exeunt 

r aaspas though thy birth and parentage 
seem deadly to the assyrian ear 
be descend of our chief foe 
who purchase gentry by our overthrow 
and in their ensign bear the assyrian arm 
yet see thou come as confederate 
in token that I love and honour thou 
receive this sword and fight courageous

and for the wrong that Cyrus offer i 
unless my destiny prevent my drift 
I will quick handsel it with Cyrus blood

for in the field wherein your father fall 
I get rich armour gold and sumptuous tent 
all which he take unto his proper use 
and give unto his special favourite 
nor have I where withal at Cyrus hand 
to heal those wound which I receive in fight 

then see thou make as deep wound in his flesh 
and so cry quittance with the covetous king 
I give thou to this sword armour and horse 
a horse as fierce as proud Bucephalus 
armour of trusty proof than Thetis find 
therefore araspas fight courageous 

albeit I have not Alexander skill 
to manage he nor yet Achilles arm 
to charge as brave yet as good a heart 
as Alexander or Achilles ever have 
and when I shrink for fear out of the field 
let i be tear in piece with that horse 
or hew to death with this bright cortelaux 

thy word araspas entice i to the field 
and make i think I shall be conqueror 
come let we march from wealthy Babylon 
and then towards Cyrus with our royal camp exeunt 

my husband mighty lord from Bactria 
where he lie legar for the assyrian king 
be come to serve under your highness flag 
and in your aid have bring two thousand horse 
back by his friend assyrian gentleman 
all which will die at conquer Cyrus foot 

be Abradates come from Bactria 
then will I leave to moan araspas loss 
and think on conquest and sweet victory 
Gobrias go with lovely Panthea 
and bring he present unto our tent 
with those brave horseman of Assyria 
you warlike and victorious man 
marshal your several band in equipage 
that abradates king of Susia 
may wonder at the hugeness of our camp 
and be the willing to league with we enter Abradates with other 
here he come and if by his aspect 
I may conjecture of his quality 
he be valiant wise trusty and liberal 

I need not ask which be the persian king 
the virtue shine in his glorious look 
say this be Cyrus and in sign of love 
will Abradates thus salute his grace 

sweet Abradates thou embrace i 
have steal my heart I love and honour thou 

fair lord be never captive gentle use 
than Panthea of this gracious conqueror 
for Panthea Cyrus i and this my train 
of which the mean soldier may take charge 
and be commander of a camp of man 
so able wise and venturous they be 
do rest for ever at your highness beck 
our horse which be graze on the plain 
in winter gallop and in icy sea 
and in the summer swim the deep stream 
swift be they in pace then lightfoot hart 
sure they be then camel plod on the way 
fierce than tiger and as 
elephant with castle on their back 
and if they be compass with arm pike 
they know which way to make their passage forth 
and when their side be paint eke with blood 
they pull their reins and look down to the ground 
as if they vaunt of their service do 
the rider be dismount they stand still 
and kneel upon the ground to take he up 
but if he chance to die they pine to death 
these be Cyrus and the rider too 
soldier as good as ever sun behold 

these horse thou speak of make i glory more 
than lydian Croesus in his heap of gold 
and of they all do Cyrus make account 
as of the strength and sinew of the war 
we have intelligence the assyrian king 
be come from Babylon to meet we straight 
therefore if Abradates favour we 
mount and away for we will assail they first 

for that come Abradates let we away 

but Abradates I will arm thou first 
see thou these pouldron they be gold 
these vanbrace and cuirass massy gold 
the gorget and thy helmet beat gold 
the belt embroider gold yet all too base 
for abradate lovely than the gold 
may never spear be break on this breast 
but that the point thereof may soon return 
and strike he dead that dare to give that charge 
this helmet shun thou from the sling sand dart 
this kiss make thou turn with victory 
as for this garland make of lofty palm 
Panthea reserve it for her conquer lord 
upon who head will Panthea fasten it 
and hang on hit neck like Hector wife 
inquire the manner of the battle past

on who head the cross bow and the sling 
will shoot and throw bullet of massy iron 
who very fall will strike aclipos down 
in midst whereof Antiochus will march 
before who do a thousand bondman draw 
a brazen wall build upon turn wheel 
to guard he sure and his concubine

will show himself or many hour expire 
his temple adorn with victorious palm 

when to the sight my lord address his band 
devout enter I Belona fame 
and there before the altar of the saint 
perfume the air with smoke of holy fire 
and breathe forth my plaint and eke my moan 
thrice I i seem the goddess turn her face 
offendinglike frown with angry brow 
against my prayer and my holy vow 
oh Cyrus if my jealous thought divine 
some dismal sequel to this fantasy 
yet pardon i see woman wit be weak 
and love abound with superstitious fear 

madam I trust the presence of your lord 
return back in triumph and renown 
shall soon remove those thought out of your mind 
so grant the god my country president 

what slaughter body do you persian bring 

Cyrus the body of the susian king 
stout Abradates by the egyptian slay 

now let my lord the prince of Persia judge 
whether unhappy Panthea fear in vain 
oh noble love who manly heart deserve 
to joy the benefit of long life 
and rich trophy to enlarge the same 
but tell we now after what sort he die 

mount aloft his chariot arm with scythe 
beat the strong Egyptian down 
a few of his familiar trusty friend 
with dreadful race insist his chariot wheel 
while the other in the battle turn back 
abandon he among the egyptian pike 
yet Abradates with the few remain 
by force and virtue of his puissant hand 
send thousand of the heathenish foe to hell 
till at the last dismount from his seat 
and round environ with his enemy 
after so many mortal wound receive 
he fall and yield up his kingly ghost 
the egyptian as their barbarous custom be 
when he be dead cut off his stout right hand 
and leave it lie by the breathless corpse 
but with a band of persian man at arm 
we rescue he and bring he to your grace 
here to receive such worthy funeral 
as fit the honour of so great a lord 

now Euphrates who sad and hollow bank 
have suck the sum of abradates blood 
which from his wound do issue with his life 
now cease thy course of thy disdain tear 
and let thy courage turn against the tide 
of mere remorse of wretched Panthea plaint 
be this the hand that plight faith to i 
the hand that aye have manage kingly arm 
and bring whole troop of mighty warrior down 
now descend from the body of my lord 
clean void of feeling sense and vital breath 
so god and cruel destiny command 
malignant of poor Panthea happiness 
live Cyrus you lord of Persia 
command my honour to posterity 
that age hence the world report may make 
that Panthea die for abradates sake she stab herself 

go be my lady peerless Panthea 
slay with self grief for abradates sake 
Nicasia loathe to live when she be go 
the pride and phoenix of Assyria 
I will not presume to touch the fatal steel 
wherein my lady sacred blood do smoke 
receive i in thy bowel Euphrates 
and let thy bottom be nicasia grave 

o Persian see if any breath remain 

Cyrus alas all sense of feel be go 
his senseless limb with stiffness overgrow 
no rub warm aught avail we 
but pale death sit as conqueror over he 

mirror of honour and true nobility 
no age no time shall ever raze thy fame 
while Euphrates do keep his run stream 
what Abradates and chaste Panthea too 
oh Abradates worthy man at arm 
oh Panthea chaste virtuous and amiable 
this office Cyrus to your wander ghost 
reserve in store to grace your funeral 
with monument of fatal ebony 
of cedar marble let and during brass 
that future world and infant yet unborn 
may kiss your tomb wherein your body lie 
and wonder at the virtue of your mind 
assyrian lord such honour thou shall have 
as never have Assyrian at his grave 
six hundred head of cattle shall be slay 
and sacrifice upon the funeral day 
twelve thousand horse be man each one 
trap all in black shall go before thy hearse 
the tower battlement of Babylon 
bend in contempt of heaven and earth and man 
those mark of pride shall be abate down 
to make a show of mourning for thy death 
such honour as you both receyude in life 
such honour shall you both receive in death
