of bloody execution and now ask 
if I be guilty therein do appear 
what justice you have use call you this law 

thou do mistake our meaning Falconbridge 
we do not ask as be ignorant 
of thy transgression but as urge thou 
to hearty sorrow for thy vile misdeed 
that heaven may take compassion on thy soul 

how charitable you will seem to be it 
I fear anon you will say it be for love 
you bind i thus and bring i to the block 
and that of mere affection you be move 
to cut my head off cunning policy 
such butcher as yourselves never want 
a colour to excuse your slaughterous mind 

we butcher thou can thou deny thyself 
but thou have be a pirate on the sea 
can thou deny but with the commonalty 
of Kent and Essex thou do rise in arm 
and twice assault the city London where 
thou twice do take repulse and since that time 
can thou deny that be flee from hence

so little do I reckon of the name 
of ugly death as be he visible 
I will wrestle with he for the victory 
and tug the slave and tear he with my tooth 
but I will make he stoop to Falconbridge 
and for this life this paltry brittle life 
this blast of wind which you have labour foe 
by jury session and I know not what 
to rob i off be of so vile repute 
that to attain that I may live my age 
I will not give the value of a point 
you can be so cruel to afflict 
but I will be as forward to endure 

go to leave of these role brave of thou 
and think upon thy soul health Falconbridge 

Submit and ask forgiveness of thy king 

what king

and pull the diadem from off his head 

thou be a traitor stop thy traitor mouth 

I be no traitor Lancaster be king 
if that be treason to defend his right 
what be it for they that do imprison he 
if insurrection to advance his sceptre 
what fault be they that step into his throne 
o God thou pour the balm upon his head 
can that pure unction be wipe off again 
thou once do crown he in his infancy 
shall wicked man now in his age depose he 
o pardon i if I expostulate 
more than become a sinful man to do 
England I fear thou will thy folly rue 

thou trifle time and do but weary we 
with dilatory question make a end 

Indeed the end of all kingdom must end 
honour and riches all must have a end 
and he that think he do the most prevail 
his head once lay there rest but a tale 
come fellow do thy office what methinks 
thou look as if thy heart be in thy hose 
pull up thy spirit it will be quick do 
a blow or two at most will serve the turn

good mistress shore this do your love procure 
this shape be secret and I hope it be sure 
the waterman that daily use the court 
and see i often know i not in this 
at lion key I land in their view 
yet none of they take knowledge of the king 
if any gallant strive to have the wall 
I will yield it gentle soft here must I turn 
here be Lombard street and here be the pelican 
and there be the phoenix in the pelican nest 
oh rare perfection of rich nature work 
bright twinkle spark of precious diamond 
of great value than all India 
be there no sun by who kind lovely heat 
the earth bring forth those stone we hold of prize 
her radiant eye deject to the ground 
will turn each pebble to a diamond 
gaze greedy eye and be not satisfy 
till you find rest where heart desire do bide 

what will you buy sir that you look on here 

your fair jewel be it not too dear 
first how this sapphire mistress that you wear 

sir it be right that will I warrant you 
no jeweller in London show a better 

no nor the like you praise it pass well 

do I no if some lapidary have the stone more will not buy it then I can demand it be as well set I think as ere you see 

it be set indeed upon the fair hand that ere I see 

you be dispose to jest but for value his majesty may wear it 

may he i'faith 

sir it be the ring I mean 

I mean the hand 

you be a merry man 
I see you come too cheap and not to buy 

yet he that offer fair than I will do shall hardly find a partner in his bargain 

perhaps in buy thing of so small value 

Rather because no wealth can purchase it 

he be too fond that will so high prize 
the thing which once be give away for love 

his hap be good that come so easy by it 

the gift so small that ask who can deny it 

o she give more that such a gift then give 
then earth ere have or world shall ever have

that have give he what you rate so high 
and yet be still the poor by the match 

that easy prove he do not know the worth 

yet have have the use of it so long 
it rather prove you over rate the thing 
he be a chapman as it seem you be 

indeed none shall adventure on the thing 
that be to be purchase only by a king 

if king love that which no man else respect 
it may be so else do I see small reason 
a king shall take delight in such course stuff
