that violet droop but now 
how it be exalt at thy smile and spread 
a virgin bosom to thou there be a rose 
will have sleep still within his bud but at 
thy presence it do open his thin curtain

to tell thou what a happiness be now 
come from heaven upon thou

thy pure devotion 
rich than cloud of incense myrrh and cassia 
and all the gum who pile make sweet our altar 
have be delightful to the god and i 
and I have leave the palace of the bless 
where many glorious virgin wait and want thou 
a fellow singer in their heavenly choir 
to visit in this form the fair Emeria 
and thank thou for thy pious sacrifice 
rise then and be confirm we mean to honour 
thy person and thy virtue 

can this roof 
be so much bless and can so great a deity 
consider my imperfect duty thus 

to assure thy thought ask fair virgin what 
thou most desire and it shall firm than 
the destiny be make thy own have thou 
a wish to this world glory to be great 
will thou enlarge thy knowledge or thy pleasure 
do thou affect to have thy life extend 
double the course of nature or thy beauty 
above the malice of disease or time 
to wither will thou see thy book of fate 
and read the various line that fall into 
thy life as to their centre speak and be 
possess if thou refuse what here be name 
thy wish will come too late Emeria 

none of all these let i be still accept 
a humble servant to the god

be say or think riches delight or harmony 
health beauty and all these not subject to 
the waste of time but in their height eternal 
lose for a pension or poor spot of earth 
favour of greatness or a hour faint pleasure 
as man in scorn of a true flame that be near

these serpent tame at first and innocent 
until man great revolt from grace release 
their duty of creation you have bring 
and arm against my life all these can I 
approach and without tremble walk upon 
play with their sting which though to i not dangerous 
I can to your destruction turn upon 
yourselves and punish with too late repentance 
but you shall live and what your malice mean 
my ruin I will turn to all your safety 
and you shall witness hence you frightful monster 
go hide and bury your deform head 
for ever in the sea from this time be 
this island free from beast of venomous nature 
the shepherd shall not be afraid hereafter 
to trust his eye withsleep upon the hill 
the traveller shall have no suspicion 
or fear to measure with his weary limb 
the silent shade but walk through every brake 
without more guard than his own innocence 
the very earth and wood shall have this blessing 
above what other christian nation boast 
although transport where these serpent live 
and multiply one touch shall soon destroy they 

see how they all obey he Archimagus 

confusion all my art be trample on 
can neither man nor beast nor devil hurt he 
support i fellowpriest I sink I feel 
the ground bend with my weight upon it ha 
the earth be loose in the foundation 
and something heavy as the world do hang 
upon my foot and weigh i to the centre 
a sire a dreadful fire be underneath i 
and all those fiend that be my servant here 
look like tormentor and all seem to strive 
who first shall catch my fall flesh upon 
their burn pike there be a power above 
our god I see too late I fall I fall 
and in my last despair I curse you all 

Patrick the king will kneel to thou 

o rise 
and pay to heaven that duty 

can forgive 
let i embrace you all and free give 
what I desire from this good man a pardon 
thou shall no more suspect i but possess 
all thy desire the ground be shut again 
where now be Archimagus how I shake 
and court this Christian out of fear not love 
once more visit our palace holy father 
the story of your son and what concern 
your escape madam we will know hereafter 
in the mean time be secure 

we be your creature 

our prayer and duty 

I suspect he still 
but fear not our good angel still be near we 
death at the last can but untie our frailty 
it be happy for our holy faith to bleed 
the blood of martyr be the church seed
