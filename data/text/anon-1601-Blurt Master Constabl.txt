a argument that either you dare not or love not to flatter 

no more than I dare or love to do wrong yet to make a chronicle of my friend noblyacted deed will stand as far from flattery in i as cowardice do from he 

'sfoot if all the wit in this company have nothing to set itself about but to run division upon i why then even burn off my ear indeed but my little mermaid signior Camillo do this that I now may describe the ninivitical motion of the whole battle and so tell what he have do and come shall I begin

I do first deliver to your most skreete and longfingered hand this head or top of all the member bare and uncombed to show how deep I stand in reverence of your naked female beauty bright and unclipped angel if I be to make a discovery of any newfound land as Virginia or so to lady and courtier my speech shall hoist up sail fit to bear up such lofty and well rig vessel but because I be to deal only with the civil city matron I will not lay upon your blush and delicate cheek any other colour than such as will give luster to your chittie face in and to that purpose our thesis be take out of that most plentiful but most precious book entitle the economical cornucopia 

the what 

the economical cornucopia thus

that she be keep under yet rule all the reins 

o again sweet signior complain 
that she be keep under what follow 

yet rule all the reins 
wife be that wife who with apt wit complain 
that she be keep under yet rule all the reins 
most pure and refine plant of nature I will not as this distinction entice take up the part as they lie here in order as first to touch your wisdom it be folly next your complain it be too common three your keep under it be above my capacity and last the reins in your own hand that be the aperse of all the very cream of all and therefore how to skim off that only only listen a wife wise no matter apt wit no matter complain no matter keep under no great matter but to rule the roast be the matter 

that rule of the roast go with i 

and i 

and i I will have a cut of that roast 

since then a woman only desire be to have the reins in her own white hand your chief practice the very same day that you be wive must be to get hold of these reins and be full get or wound about yet to complain with apt wit as though you have they not 

how shall we know signior when we have they all or not 

I will furnish your capable understanding out of my poor spanish store with the chief implement and their appurtenance observe it shall be your first and fine praise to sing the note of every new fashion at first sight and if you can to stretch that note above eela 

good 

the more you pinch your servant belly for this the smooth will the fashion sit on your back but if your good man like not this music as be too full of crotchet your only way be to learn to play upon the virginal and so nail his ear to your sweet humour if this be out of time too yet your labour will quit the cost for by this mean your secret friend may have free and open access to you under the colour of prick you lesson now because you may tie your husband love in most sweet knot you shall never give over labour till out of his purse you have dig a garden and that garden must stand a pretty distance from the city for by repair thither much good fruit may be graft 

mark that 

then in the afternoon when you address your sweet perfume body to walk to this garden there to gather a nosegay sopinwine cowslip columbine heartsease etc the first principle to learn be that you stick black patch for the rheum on your delicate blue temple though there be no room for the rheum black patch be comely in most woman and be well fasten draw man eye to shoot glance at you next your ruff must stand in print and for that purpose get poke stick with fair and long handle lest they scorch your lily sweat hand than your hat with a little brim if you have a little face if otherwise otherwise beside you must play the wag with your wanton fan have your dog call pearl or Min or why ask you or any other pretty name dance along by you your embroider muff before you on your ravish hand but take heed who thrust his finger into your fur 

we will watch for that 

once a quarter take state upon you and be chick be chick thus politic lie at your garden your lipsworn servant may there visit you as a physician where otherwise if you languish at home be sure your husband will look to your water this thickness may be increase with give out that you breed young bone and to stick flesh upon those bone it shall not be amiss if you long for peascod at ten groat the cod and for cherry at a crown the cherry
