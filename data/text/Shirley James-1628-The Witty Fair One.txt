o master fowler 

ha out with it nay and the woman but acknowledge i alive there be some hope a i 

I love thou live with a holy flame to purge the error of thy wanton youth 

I be dead again 

This make thy soul sue out so hasty a divorce 
and flee to airy dwelling have 
leave we thy cold pale figure which we have 
commission but to chamber up in 
melancholy dust where thy own worm 
like the false servant of some great man shall 
devour thou first 

I be worm meat 

we must all die 

woo some of you will do it quick that I may have company 

but be thou now to live again with we 
and that by miracle thy soul shall with thy 
body have second marriage I believe 
thou will study to keep it a chaste temple holy 
thought like fume of sacred incense hover 
about this heart than thou will learn to be 
above thy frailty and resist the flattery of 
smoothfaced lust 

this be my funeral sermon 

the burden of which sin my fear persuade i both hasten and accompany thy death 

this sorrow be unfruitful 

I have do 
may this prayer profit he will his soul be 
as sure to gain heaven as his body be here 

we must hope the best he be a inconstant young man frequent of some company have corrupt his nature and a little debauch he 

in all this sermon I have hear little commendation of our dear brother depart rich man do not go to the pithole without compliment of christian burial it seem if I have live to have make a will and bequeath so much legacy as will purchase some preacher a neat cassock I shall have die in as good estate and assurance for my soul as the best gentleman in the parish have my monument in a conspicuous place of the church where I shall have be cut in a form of prayer as if I have be call away at my devotion and so for haste to be in heaven go thither with my book and spectacle do hear lady and gentleman be it your pleasure to see i though not know i and to inform a walk business when this so much lament brother of you depart out of this world in his life I have some relation to he what disease die he of pray who be his heir yet at common law for he be warm in the possession of land thank his kind father who have be in a consumption sixteen year one day above all the rest have nothing else to do die that the young man may be a landlord accord to the custom of his ancestor 

I doubt the project 

you shall be his heir or executor at least by your dry eye sir I commend thou what a miserable folly it be to weep for one that be dead and have no sense of our lamentation wherefore be black invent to save our eye their tedious distillation it be enough to be sad in our habit they have cause to weep that have no mourn cloth it be a sign they get little by the dead and that be the great sorrow now adays you love he lady to say truth you have little cause a wild young man yet and he be alive again as that be in vain to wish you know he may perchance be more sensible and reward you with better service so you will not proclaim his weakness faith speak well of the dead hereafter and bury all his fault with he will you what be these all the guest ha what paper some elegy or epitaph who subscribe o this be your poetry 
how he die some do suppose
