I love these jest exceed 

I think thou love they better than quarrel Bessus he say so much in thy behalf and yet thou be valiant enough upon a retreat I think thou will kill any man that stop thou and thou can 

but be not this a brave combat Mardonius 

why do thou see it 

you stand with i 

I do so but methinks thou wink every blow they strike 

well I believe there be better soldier than I that never see two prince fight in list 

by my troth I think so too Bessus many a thousand but certain all that be worse than thou have see as much 

it be brave do of our king 

yes if he have not end the war I be glad thou dare talk of such dangerous business 

to take a prince prisoner in the heart of his own country in single combat 

see how thy blood curdle at this I think thou will be content to be beat in this passion 

shall I tell you true 

I 

I can willing venture for it 

umh no venture neither good Bessus 

let i not live if I do not think it be a brave piece of service then that I be so fame for 

why be thou fame for any valour 

I fame ay I warrant you 

I be very hearty glad on it I have be with thou ever since thou come of the war and this be the first word that ever I hear on it prithee who fame thou 

the christian world 

it be heathenish do of they in my conscience thou deserve it not 

yes I have do good service 

I do not know how thou may wait of a man in his chamber or thy agility in shift a trencher but otherwise no service good Bessus 

you see i do the service yourself 

not so hasty sweet Bessus where be it be the place vanish 

at Bessus desperate redemption 

Bessus desperate redemption where be that 

there where I redeem the day the place bear my name 

prithee who christen it 

the soldier 

if I be not a very mere dispose man what will become of thou one that have but a grain of collar in the whole composition of his body will send thou of a errand to the worm for put thy name upon that field do not I beat thou there in the head of the troop with a truncheon because thou will needs run away with thy company when we shall charge the enemy 

true but I do not run 

Right Bessus I beat thou out on it 

but come not I up when the day be go and redeem all 

thou know and so do I thou mean to fly and thy fear make thou mistake thou run upon the enemy and a hot charge thou give as I will do thou right thou be furious in run away and I think we owe thy fear for our victory if I be the king and be sure thou will mistake always and run away upon the enemy thou shall be general by this light 

you will never leave this till I fall foul 

no more such word dear Bessus for though I have ever know thou a coward and therefore dare never strike thou yet if thou proceed I will allow thou valiant and beat thou 

Come come our king be a brave fellow 

he be so Bessus I wonder how thou come to know it but if thou be a man of understanding I will tell thou he be vainglorious and humble and angry and patient and merry and dull and joyful and sorrowful in extremity in a hour do not think i thy friend for this for if I care who know it thou shall not hear it Bessus here he be with the prey in his foot 

thy sadness brave Tigranes take away 
from my fall victory be I become 
of so small fame that any man shall grieve 
when I overcome he they that place i here 
intend it a honour large enough 
for the most valiant live but to dare 
oppose i single though he lose the day 
what shall afflict you you be free as I 
to be my prisoner be to be more free 
than you be former and never think 
the man I hold worthy to combat i 
shall be use servile thy ransom be 
to take my only sister to thy wife 
a heavy one Tigranes for she be 
a lady that the neighbour prince send 
blank to fetch home I have be too unkind 
to she Tigranes she but nine year old 
I leave she and never see she since your war 
have hold I long and teach i though a youth 
the way to victory she be a pretty child 
then I be little better but now fame 
cry loud on she and my messenger 
make i believe she be a miracle 
she will make you shrink as I do with a stroke 
but of her eye Tigranes 
be it the course of 
Iberia to use their prisoner thus 
have fortune throw my name above Arbaces 
I shall not thus have talk for in Armenia 
we hold it base you shall have keep your temper 
till you see home again where it be the fashion 
perhaps to brag 

be you my witness earth 
need I to brag do not this captive prince 
speak i sufficient and all the act 
that I have wrought upon his suffer land 
shall I then boast where lie that foot of ground 
within his whole realm that I have not pass 
fight and conquer far then from i 
be ostentation I can tell the world 
how I have lay his kingdom desolate 
with this sole arm prop by divinity 
strip he out of his glory and have send 
the pride of all his youth to people grave 
and make his virgin languish for their love 
if I will brag shall I that have the power 
to teach the neighbour world humility 
mix with vain glory 

in deed this be none 

Tigranes no do I but take delight 
to stretch my deed as other do on word 
I can amaze my hearer 

so you do 

but he shall wrong his and my modesty 
that think i apt to boast after a act 
fit for a god to do upon his foe 
a little glory in a soldier mouth 
be well become be it far from vain 

its pity that valour shall be thus drink 

I offer you my sister and you answer 
I do insult a lady that no suit 
nor treasure nor thy crown can purchase thou 
but that thou fight with i 

though this be worse 
than that you speak before it strike not i 
but that you think to overgrace i with 
the marriage of your sister trouble i 
I will give world for ransom be they i 
rather than have she 

see if I insult 
that be the conqueror and for a ransom 
offer rich treasure to the conquer 
which he refuse and I bear his scorn 
it can be self flattery to say 
the daughter of your country set by she 
will see their shame run home and blush to death 
at their own foulness yet she be not fair 
nor beautiful those word express she not 
they say her look be something excellent 
that want a name yet be she odious 
her birth deserve the empire of the world 
sister to such a brother that have take 
victory prisoner and throughout the earth 
carry she bind and shall he let her loose 
she dare not leave he nature do she wrong 
to print continual conquest on her cheek 
and make no man worthy for she to take 
but i that be too near she and as strange 
she do for i but you will think I brag 

I do I will be swear thy valour and thy passion severe will have make two excellent fellow in their kind I know not whether I shall be sorry thou be so valiant or so passionate will one of they be away 

do I refuse she that I doubt her worth 
be she as virtuous as she will be think 
so perfect that no own of her own sex 
will find a want have she so tempt fair 
that she can wish it off she damn soul 
I will pay any ransom twentytimes 
rather than meet she marry in my bed 
perhaps I have a love where I have fix 
my eye not to be move and she on i 
I be not fickle 

be that all the cause 
think you you can so knit yourself in love 
to any other that her search sight 
can dissolve it so before you try 
you think yourself a match for i in fight 
trust i Tigranes she can do as much 
in peace as I in war she will conquer too 
you shall see if you have the power to stand 
the force of her swift look if you dislike 
I will send you home with love and name your ransom 
some other way but if she be your choice 
she free you to Ileria you must 

sir I have learn a prisoner sufferance 
and will obey but give i leave to talk 
in private with some friend before I go 

some two await he forth and see he safe 
but let he free send for who he please 
and none dare to disturb his conference 
I will not have he know what bondage be exeunt 
till he be free from i this prince Mardonius 
be full of wisdom valour all the grace 
man can receive 

and yet you conquer he 

and yet I conquer he and can have do 
have thou join with he though thy name in arm 
be great must all man that be virtuous 
think sudden to match themselves with i 
I conquer he and brave do I not 

and please your majesty I be afraid at first 

when be thou other 

of what 

that you will not have spy your best advantage for your majesty in my opinion lie too high methinks under favour you shall have lie thus

what to do 

to put your majesty in mind of a occasion you lay thus and Tigranes falsify a blow at your leg which you by do thus avoid but if you have whip up your leg thus and reach he on the ear you have make the blood run about his head 

what countryfenceschool do thou learn that at 

puff do I not take he noble 

why you do and you have talk enough on it 

talk enough 
while you confine my word by heaven and earth 
I be much better be a king of beast

throughout the world they will offend to death

Alas she be not so happy thou do know 
how she have labour since my father die 
to take by treason hence this loathe life

to pay that man nature be poor to i 
that will not let i have as many death 
as be the time that he have save my life 
that I may die they over all for he 

sir let she bear her sin on her own head 
vex not yourself

in all the innocent virtue that become 
a tender spotless maid she stain her cheek 
with mourn tear to purge her mother ill 
and among her sacred dew she mingle prayer 
her pure oblation for my safe return 
if I have lose the duty of a son 
if any pomp or vanity of state 
make i forget my natural office 
nay far if I have not every night 
expostulate with my wander thought 
if aught unto my parent they have err 
and call they back do you direct her arm 
unto this foul dissemble heart of i 
but if I have be just to she send out 
your power to compass i and hold i safe

from my own vein issue a deadly flood 
then wash my danger off with mother blood 

I never see such sudden extremity 

why will thou have i die Spaconia 
what shall I do

from other woman many a weep verse 
he will lay on and much lament those maid 
that place their love unfortunate tool light 
as I have do where they can never reach

why yes I will tell your grace they be not to fight till the word give which for my own part by my troth I be not to give

madam I will take my leave too 

good Bacurius 

madam what write his majesty to you 

o my lord 
the kind word I will keep they while I live 
here in my bosom there be no art in they 
they lie disorder in this paper just 
as hearty nature speak they 

and to i 
he write what tear of joy he shed to hear 
how you be grow in every virtuous way 
and yield all thanks to i for that dear care 
which I be bind to have in train you 
there be no prince live that enjoy 
a brother of that worth 

my lord no maid long more for any thing or feel more heat and cold within her breast than I do now in hope to see he 

yet I wonder much at this he write he bring along with he a husband for you that same captive prince 
and if he love you as he make a show 
he will allow you freedom in your choice 

and so he will my lord I warrant you 
he will but offer and give i the power 
to take or leave 

trust i be I a lady I can not like 
that man be bargain with before I choose he 

but I be not build on such wild humour 
if I find time worthy he be not less 
because he be offer 

it be true he be not will he will seem less 

I think there be no lady can affect 
another prince your brother stand by 
he do eclipse man virtue so with this 

I know a lady may and more I fear 
another lady will 

will I may see he 

why so you shall my business be great 
I will attend you when it be his pleasure 
to see you madam 

I thank you good my lord 

you will be ready madam 

yes 

I do beseech you madam send away 
your other woman and receive from i 
a few sad word which set against your joy 
may make they shine the more 

sir leave i all 

I kneel a stranger here to beg a thing 
unfit for i to ask and you to grant 
it be such another strange ill lay request 
as if a beggar shall entreat a king 
to leave his sceptre and his throne to he 
and take his rag to wander over the world 
hungry and cold 

that be a strange request 

as ill be i 

then do not utter it 

Alas it be of that nature that it must 
be utter ay and grant or I die 
I be ashamed to speak it but where life 
lie at the stake I can think her woman 
that will not take something unreasonable 
to hazard save of it I shall seem 
a strange petitioner that wish all ill 
to they I beg of ere they give i aught 
yet so I must I will you be not fair 
nor wise for in your ill consist my good 
if you be foolish you will hear my prayer 
if foul you have not power to hinder i 
he will not love you 

what be the meaning of it 

nay my request be more without the bound 
of reason yet for it be not in the power 
of you to do what I will have you grant 

why then it be idle prithee speak it out 

your brother bring a prince into this land 
of such a noble shape so sweet a grace 
so full of worth withal that every maid 
that look upon he give away herself 
to he for ever and for you to have 
he bring he and so mad be my demand 
that I desire you not to have this man 
this excellent man for who you needs must die 
if you shall miss he I do now expect 
you shall laugh at i 

trust i I can weep 
rather for I have find in all thy word 
a strange disjoint sorrow 

it be by i 
his own desire too that you will not love he 

his own desire why credit i Thalestris 
I be no common wooer if he shall woo i 
his worth may be such that I dare not swear 
I will not love he but if he will stay 
to have i woo he I will promise thou 
he may keep all his grace to himself 
and fear no ravish from i 

it be yet 
his own desire but when he see your face 
I fear it will not be therefore I charge you 
as you have pity stop those tender ear 
from his enchant voice close up those eye 
that you may neither catch a dart from he 
nor he from you I charge you as you hope 
to live in quiet for when I be dead 
for certain I shall walk to visit he 
if he break promise with i for as fast 
as oath without a formal ceremony 
can make i I be to he 

then be fearless 
for if he be a thing betwixt God and man 
I can gaze on he if I know it sin 
to love he without passion dry your eye 
I swear you shall enjoy he still for i 
I will not hinder you but I perceive 
you be not what you seem rise rise Thalestris 
if your right name be so 

Indeed it be not 
Spaconia be name but I desire 
not to be know to other 

why by i 
you shall not I will never do you wrong 
what good I can I will think not my birth 
or education such that I shall injure

if there be any in that noble heart 
to she a wretched lady and forlorn 
or for her love to you which be as much 
as nature and obedience ever give 
have pity on her beauty 

prithee stand up it be true she be too fair 
and all these commendation but her own 
will thou have never so commend she

Alas she will be at liberty 
and there be thousand reason gobrius 
that will deny it 
which if she know she will content 
be where she be and bless her virtue for it 
and i though she be close she will gobrius 
good man indeed she will 

then good sir for her satisfaction 
send for she and with reason make she know 
why she must live thus from you 

I will go bring she to i 

you be very welcome both some stool there boy 
and reach a table gentleman of the sword 
pray sit without more compliment be go child 
I have be curious in the search of you 
because I understand you wise and valiant person 

we understand ourselves sir 

nay gentleman and my dear friend of the sword 
no compliment I pray but to the cause 
I hang upon which in few be my honour 

you can hang too much sir for your honour 
but to your cause be wise and speak truth 

my first doubt be my beat by my prince 

stay there a little sir do you doubt a beat 
or have you have a beat by your prince 

gentleman of the sword my prince have beat i 

brother what think you of this case 

if he have beat he the case be clear 

if he have beat he I grant the case 
but how we can be too subtle in this business 
I say but how 

Even with his royal hand 

be it a blow of love or indignation 

it be twenty blow of indignation gentleman 
beside two blow of the face 

those blow of the face have make a new case of it 
the rest be but a honourable rudeness 

two blow of the face and give by a worse man I must confess as we swordman say have turn the business mark i brother by a worse man but be by his prince have they be ten and those ten draw ten tooth beside the hazard of his nose for ever all these have be but favour this be my flat opinion which I will die in 

the king may do much captain believe it for have he crack your skull through like a bottle or break a rib or two with cross of you yet you have lose no honour this be strange you may imagine but this be truth now captain 

I will be glad to embrace it gentleman 
but how far may he strike i 

there be another 
a new cause rise from the time and distance 
in which I will deliver my opinion 
he may strike beat or cause to be beat for these be natural to man your prince I say may beat you so far forth as his dominion reach that be for the distance the time ten mile a day I take it 

brother you err it be fifteen mile a day 
his stage be ten his beat be fifteen 

it be of the long but we subject must 
be subject to it you be wise and virtuous 

obedience ever make that noble use on it 
to which I dedicate my beat body 
I must trouble you a little further gentleman of the sword 

no trouble at all to we sir if we may 
profit your understanding we be bind 
by virtue of our call to utter our opinion 
short and discreet 

my sore business be I have be kick 

how far sir 

not to flatter myself in it all over my sword force but not lose for discreet I render it to save that imputation 

it show discretion the best part of valour 

brother this be a pretty case pray ponder on it 
our friend here have be kick 

he have so brother 

sore he say now have he sit down here 
upon the mere kick it have be cowardly 

I think it have be cowardly indeed

as kill as the plague ready to seize thou 

far be it from i to revile the king

to search out death that else will search out i 
and in a grave sleep with my innocence 
then welcome such a sin it be my fate

that as it be I never shall sway my heart 
to like another 

then I curse my birth

that thou be willing too be there no step 
to our full happiness but these mere sound 
brother and sister

and I will raze they and then blow they up 
let they be sea and I will drink they off 
and yet have unquenched fire leave in my breast 
let they be any thing but mere voice 

but it be not in the power of any force 
or policy to conquer they 

Panthaea 
what shall we do shall we stand firm here and gaze our eye out 

will I can do so
