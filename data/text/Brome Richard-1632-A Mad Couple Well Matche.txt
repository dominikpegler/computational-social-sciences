a sweet gentleman and bountiful if my lady have be bless with such a husband what a place have I have 

do you know the content mr Saveall of the familiar epistle you have bring i here 

no lady but I guess it a fair expression of the writer affection to you although he desire i to crave your pardon for the rudeness of his style it be the first that he have compose of that consequence 

ha ha ha I will trust you sir with the full knowledge of it pray read it yourself 

I find she be please and my endeavour prosperous for the young gentleman I be sorry that I delay a day in the deliver of it 

pray read it out sir for I find it so pleasant that I can hear it a whole day together 

in the first place you shall give i leave to wonder at your impudence though it be but in your dream to have a thought that I ever intend or can be draw by persuasion force or the power of witchcraft to marry you 
bless i sure if he write this the devil dictate to he 

on sir that be but his first charge 

second I be to tell you that I be warm in my uncle favour and it be not a piece a time or five piece for a piece of pleasure can undo i and so I can have change and escape the captivity of wedlock 
this can not otherwise be do but by the devil that ought he the shame 

what follow I pray there be the first and second point past mark his method 

third and last let i advise you since you be so hot upon marriage though I assure myself you love none but i and I thank you for it that you frame or dissemble a affection to some one of the city who be but comparative to yourself in blood and fortune and so you may make byuse of i as your friend and have child like i 

have you ever hear so quaint a love letter 

lady the injury do in it to yourself be unanswerable but my wrong in be his messenger I will make he answer 

excuse i sir he have do i a favour I pray inform he so with my great thanks but for what you conceive a wrong to yourself use your discretion you have no more to say to i for he at this present have you sir 

not for he but against he I will un say all that I say before intend for his good 

but I will not hear you wrong your former love and judgement of he so which make so deep impression here that I have lock his love up as a jewel in my breast and you in strive now to wrest it thence may break the cabinet I rather wish you will be a friendly mean to draw his presence hither that I myself may mild question he 

be you serious lady 

I fear I shall not rest before I see he but do not tell he that lest in this sullen humour he force his absence to afflict i more I will hold you sir no long deal for i as you can I know you have a guess at my desire 

I will do you service in it 
I guess that her desire be to do some act of revenge upon he and so it be not mortal it be but justice in she for so gross a scorn by he cast upon a well repute gentleman yet be it observe in she that she have a violent humour to do and not to do thing oftentimes wilful against all good council or persuasion she have the spirit of contradiction in she and a unalterable resolution upon sudden intention a most incorrigible will she have that will not bow nor break this cross abusive letter therefore may do good upon she however mischievous he may intend it if she mean well to he before it may the fast bring she on but it amaze i that he shall write so bear his uncle and myself in hand that he so fair love she and beseech we to negotiate with she for he shall she forgive it yet the wrong to we in his vile manner be unpardonable and so sir I come to you 

o mr Saveall 

what mischief or despite have I ever do you 
that can provoke your desperate spleen against i 
to wound my honour 

what do you mean good sir 

you have employ i base make i your

of her fair name and worth than such as ruffian 
will send to strumpet or it be such enter Wat 
can not a porter or your pander there 
serve for the lewd conveyance 
what a welcome be that 

you might safe 
have send it so and your own right hand with it 
then to have draw my just revenge upon you 

hold I beseech you and sir though I lose the widow by my error which be indeed but a mere accident let i not be so miserable make as to lose you before you hear a short examination

no more of that sweet heart farewell expect i early in the morning 

I be glad of his absence tonight lest there shall happen some combustion in the house by his unruly nephew in case he shall discover my deceit in beguile he with his own wench instead of i I do even tremble to think upon the unnatural villain that will offer so to wrong his uncle I think I have school he sufficient and beat he off at his first attempt and he to assail i again with more forcible temptation urge i to a promise 

the young gentleman be come in madam and as you foresee very high fly but not so drink as to forget your promise he be go to bed in expectation of your approach
