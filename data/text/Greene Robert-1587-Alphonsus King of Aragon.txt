Calliope thou which so oft do crake 
how that such client cluster to thy court 
by thick and threefold as not any any one 
of all thy sister may compare with thou 
where be thy scholar now become I trow 
where be they vanish in such sudden sort 
that while as we do play upon our string 
you stand still laze and have nought to do 

Melpomene make you a why of that 
I know full oft you have author red 
the high tree the soon be his fall 
and they which first do flourish and bear sway 
upon the sudden vanish clean away 

mock on apace my back be broad enough 
to bear your flout as many as they be 
that year be rare that never feel winter storm 
that tree be fertile which never want fruit 
and that same muse have heap well in store 
which never want client at her door 
but yet my sister when the surgent sea 
have ebb their fill their wave do rise again 
and fill their bank up to the very brim 
and when my pipe have ease herself a while 
such store of suitor shall my seat frequent 
that you shall see my scholar be not spend 

spend quoth you sister than we be too blame 
if we shall say your scholar all be spend 
but pray now tell i when your painful pen will rest enough 

when husbandman sheer hog 

Melpomene errato and the rest 
from thick shrub dame Venus do espy 
the mortal hatred which you joint bear 
unto your sister high Calliope 
what do you think if that the tree do bend 
it follow therefore that it need must break 
and since her pipe a little while do rest 
it never shall be able for to sound 
yes muse yes if that she will vouchsafe 
to entertain dame Venus in her school 
and further i with her instruction 
she shall have scholar which will deign to be 
in any other muse company 

most sacred Venus do you doubt of that 
Calliope will think she three time bless 
for to receive a goddess in her school 
especial so high a one as you 
which rule the earth and guide the heaven too 

then sound your pipe and let we bend our step 
unto the top of high Parnassus hill 
and there together do our best devoir 
for to describe Alphonsus warlike fame 
and in the manner of a comedy 
set down his noble valour present 

as Venus will so bid Calliope 

and as you bid your sister do agree 

my noble son since first I do recount 
the noble act your predecessor do 
in Aragon against their warlike foe 
I never yet can see thou joy at all 
but hang down thy head as malcontent 
thy youthful day in mourning have be spend 
tell i Alphonsus what may be the cause 
that make thou thus to pine away with care 
have old Carinus do thou any offence 
in reckon up these story unto thou 
what never a word but mum Alphonsus speak 
unless your father fatal day you seek 

although dear father I have often vow 
never to unfold the secret of my heart 
to any man or woman who some ere 
dwell underneath the circle of the sky 
yet do your word so conjure i dear sire 
that needs I must fulfil that you require 
then so it be among the famous tale 
which you rehearse do by our sire in war 
whenas you come unto your father day 
with sob note with sigh and blubber tear 
and much ado at length you thus begin 
next to Alphonsus shall my father come 
for to possess the diadem by right 
of Aragon but that the wicked wretch 
his young brother with aspire mind 
by secret treason rob he of his life 
and i his son of that which be my due 
these word my sire do so torment my mind 
as have I be with Ixion in hell 
the raven bird can never plague i worse 
for ever since my mind have trouble be 
which way I may revenge this traitorous fact 
and that recover which be we by right 

ah my Alphonsus never think on that 
in vain it be to strive against the stream 
the crown be lose and now in huckster hand 
and all our hope be cast into the dust 
bridle these thought and learn the same of i 
a quiet life do pass a empery 

yet noble father ere Carinus brood 
shall brook his foe for to usurp his seat 
he will die the death with honour in the field 
and so his life and sorrow brief end 
but do I know my froward fate be such 
as I shall fail in this my just attempt 
this sword dear father shall the author be 
to make a end of this my tragedy 
therefore sweet sire remain you here a while 
and let i walk my fortune for to try 
I do not doubt but ere the time be long 
I will quite his cost or else myself will die 

my noble son since that thy mind be such 
for to revenge thy father foul abuse 
as that my word may not a whit prevail 
to stay thy journey go with happy fate 
and soon return unto thy father cell 
with such a train as julius Cesar come 
to noble Rome whenas he have achieve 
the mighty monarch of the triple world 
mean time Carinus in this silly grove 
will spend his day with prayer and horizon 
to mighty jove to further thy intent 
farewell dear son Alphonsus fare you well 

and be he go then high Alphonsus hie 
to try thy fortune where thy fate do call 
a noble mind disdain to hide his head 
and let his foe triumph in his overthrow 

what loiter follow have we spy here 
presume not villain further she for to go 
unless you do at length the same repent 

villain say thou nay villain in thy throat 
what know thou skipnick who thou villain call 

a common vassal I do villain call 

that shall thou soon approve persuade thyself 
or else I will die or thou shall die for i 

what do I dream or do my dazzle eye 
deceive i be it Alphonsus that I see 
do now Medea use her wont charm 
for to delude Albinius fantasy 
or do black Pluto king of dark Avernus 
seek to flout I with his counterfeit 
his body like to Alphonsus frame be 
his face resemble much Alphonsus hue 
his noble mind declare he for no less 
it be he indeed woe worth Albinius 
who babble tongue have cause his own annoy 
why do not jove send from the glitter sky 
his thunder bolt to chastise this offence 
why do dame terra cease with greedy jaw 
to swallow up Albinius present 
what shall I fly and hide my traitorous head 
from stout Alphonsus who I so misuse 
or shall I yield tush yield be in vain 
nor can I fly but he will follow i 
then cast thyself down at his grace foot 
confess thy fault and ready make thy breast 
to entertain thy well deserve death 

what news my friend why be you so blank 
that erst before do vaunt it to the sky 

pardon dear lord Albinius pardon crave 
for this offence which by the heaven I vow 
unwitting I do unto your grace 
for have I know Alphonsus have be here 
ere that my tongue have speak so traitorous 
this hand shall make my very soul to die 

rise up my friend thy pardon soon be get 
but prithee tell i what the cause might be 
that in such sort thou erst upbraid I 
have compass the circle of the sky 
I will clog their tongue since nothing else will serve 
to keep those vild and threaten speech in 
farewell Belinus look thou to thyself 
Alphonsus mean to have thy crown ere night 

what be he go the devil break his neck 
the fiend of hell torment his traitorous corpse 
be this the quittance of Belinus grace 
which he do show unto that thankless wretch 
that runagate that rakehell yea that thief 
for well I wot he have rob i of a crown 
if ever he have spring from gentle blood 
he will not thus misuse his favourer 

that runagate that rakehell yea that thief 
stay their sir king your mouth run over much 
it ill become the subject for to use 
such traitorous term against his sovereign 
know thou Belinus that Carinus son 
be neither rakehell nor runagate 
but be thou sure that ere the darksome night 
do drive God Phoebus to his Thetis lap 
both thou and all the rest of this thy train 
shall well repent the word which you have sane 

what traitorous villain do thou threaten i 
Lay hold on he and see he do not escape 
I will teach the slave to know to who he speak 
to thou I speak and to thy fellow all 
and though as now you have i in your power 
yet doubt I not but that in little space 
these eye shall see thy treason recompense 
and then I mean to vaunt of our victory 

nay proud Albinius never build on that 
for though the god do chance for to appoint 
Alphonsus victor of Belinus land 
yet shall thou never live to see that day 
and therefore Fabius stand not linger 
but present slash off his traitorous head 

slash off his head as though Albinius head 
be then so easy to be slash off 
in faith sir no when you be go and dead 
I hope to flourish like the pleasant spring 

why how now Fabius what do you stand in doubt 
to do the deed what fear you who dare seek 
for to revenge his death on thou again 
since that Belinus do command it so 
or be you wax so dainty that you dare 
not use your sword for stain of your hand 
if it be so then let i see thy sword 
and I will be his butcher for this time 
now sir Albinius be you of the mind 
that erst you be what do you look to see 
and triumph in Belinus overthrow 
I hope the very sight of this my blade 
have change your mind into another tune 

not so Belinus I be constant still 
my mind be like to the Abeston stone 
which if it once be heat in flame of fire 
deign to become cold again 
Even so be I and shall be till I die 
and though I shall see Atropos appear 
with knife in hand to slit my thread in twain 
yet never Albinius shall persuade be 
but that Belinus he shall vanquish see 

nay then Albinius since that word be vain 
for to persuade you from this heresy 
the sword shall sure put you out of doubt 

my noble lord of Aragon I know 
you wonder much what may the occasion be 
that Laelius which erst do fly the field 
do egg you forward now unto the war 
but when you hear my reason out of doubt 
you will be content with this my rash attempt 
when first our king Flaminius I do mean 
do set upon the neapolitan 
the worst of you do know and plain see 
how far they be unable to withstand 
the mighty force of our royal camp 
until such time as froward fate we think 
although the fate ordain it for our gain 
do send a strange stout who sturdy blow 
and force alone do cause our overthrow 
but to our purpose this same martial knight 
do hap to hit upon Flaminius 
and lend our king then such a friendly blow 
as that his gasp ghost to limbo go 
which when I see and seek to revenge 
my noble lord do hap on such a prize 
as never king nor keisar get the like 

Laelius of force we must confess to thou 
we wonder all whenas you do persuade 
we to return unto the war again 
but since our marvel be increase much 
by these your word which sound of happiness 
therefore good Laelius make no tarry 
but soon unfold thy happy chance to we 

then friend and fellow soldier hark to i 
when Laelius think for to revenge his king 
on that same knight instead of mortal foe 
I find he for to be our chief friend 

our chief friend I hardly can believe 
that he which make such bloody massacre 
of stout italian can in any point 
bear friendship to the country or the king 

as for your king mile I hold with you 
he bear no friendship to Flaminius 
but hate he as bloody Atropos 
but for your country Laelius do avow 
he love as well as any other land 
yea sure he love it best of all the world 
and for because you shall not think that I 
do say the same without a reason why 
know that the knight Alphonsus have to name 
both son and heir to old Carinus who 
Flaminius sire bereave of his crown 
who do not seek the ruin of our host 
for any envy he do bear to we 
but to revenge he on his mortal foe 
which by the help of high celestial jove 
he have achieve with honour in the field 

Alphonsus man I will never persuade be 
that ere Alphonsus may survive again 
who with Carinus many year ago 
be say to wander in the stygian field 

truth noble mile these my ear have hear 
for certainty report unto i 
that old Carinus with his peerless son 
have feel the sharpness of the sister shears 
and have I not of late Alphonsus see 
in good estate though all the world shall say 
he be alive I will not credit they 
but fellow soldier wend you back with i 
and let we lurk within the secret shade 
which he himself appoint unto we 
and if you find my word to be untruth 
then let i die to recompense the wrong 

Laelius make haste soldier of Aragon 
set linger by and come and help your king 
I mean Alphonsus who while that he do 
pursue Belinus at the very heel 
be sudden environ about 
with all the troop of mighty Milan land 

what news be this and be it very so 
be our Alphonsus yet in humane state 
who all the world do judge for to be dead 
yet can I scarce give credit to the same 
give credit yes and since the Milan duke 
have break his league of friendship be he sure 
ere Cynthia the shine lamp of night 
do scale the heaven with her horn head 
both he and he shall very plain see 
the league be burst that cause long the glee 

and can the traitor harbour in his breast 
such mortal treason against his sovereign 
as when he shall with fire and sword defend 
he from his foe he seek his overthrow 
march on my friend I never shall joy at all 
until I see that bloody traitor fall 

welcome brave youth of Aragon to i 
yea welcome mile Lalius and the rest 
who prowess alone have be the only cause 
that we like victor have subdue our foe 
lord what a pleasure be it to my mind 
to see Belus which not long before 
do with his threaten terrify the god 
now scud apace from warlike Lalius blow 
the duke of Milan he increase our sport 
when doubt that his force be overweak 
for to withstand mile thy sturdy arm 
do give more credence to his frisk skip 
then to the sharpness of his cut blade 
what Fabius do to pleasure we withal 
Albinius know as well as I myself 
for well I wot if that thy tire steed 
have be as fresh and swift in foot as he 
he shall have feel yea know for certainty 
to check Alphonsus do deserve to die 
brief my friend and fellow peer in arm 
the worst of you do deserve such much praise 
as that my tongue deny for to set forth 
the demie parcel of your valiant deed 
so that perforce I must by duty be 
bind to you all for this your courtesy 

not so my lord for if our willing arm 
have pleasure you so much as you do say 
we have do nought but that become we 
for to defend our mighty sovereign 
as for my part I count my labour small 
yea though it have be twice as much again 
since that Alphonsus do accept thereof 

thank worthy mile lest all the world 
shall count Alphonsus thankless for to be 
Laelius sit down and mile sit by he 
and that receive the which your sword have win 
first for because thou Laelius in these broil 
by martial might do proud Belinus chase 
from troop to troop from side to side about 
and never cease from this thy swift pursuit 
until thou have obtain his royal crown 
therefore I say I will do thou nought but right 
and give thou that which thou well have win 
here do Alphonsus crown thou Laelius king 
of Naples town with all dominion 
that erst belong to our traitorous foe 
that proud Belinus in his regiment 
Miles thy share the Milan dukedom be 
for well I wot thy sword deserve no less 
the which Alphonsus frank give thou 
in presence of his warlike man at arm 
and if that any stomach this my deed 
Alphonsus can revenge thy wrong with speed 
now to Albinius which in all my toil 
I have both faithful yea and friendly find 
since that the god and friendly fate assign 
this present time to i to recompense 
the sundry pleasure thou have do to i 
sit down by they and on thy faithful head 
receive the crown of peerless Aragon 

pardon dear lord Albinius at this time 
it ill become i for to wear a crown 
whenas my lord be destitute himself 
why high Alphonsus if I shall receive 
this crown of you the which high jove forbid 
where will yourself obtain a diadem 
Naples be go Milan possess be 
and nought be leave for you but Aragon 

and nought be leave for i but Aragon 
yes sure yes my fate have so decree 
that Aragon shall be too base a thing 
for to obtain Alphonsus for her king 
what hear you not how that our scatter foe 
Belinus Fabius and the Milan duke 
be flee for succour to the turkish court 
and think you not that Amurack their king 
will with the mighty power of all his land 
seek to revenge Belinus overthrow 
then doubt I not but ere these broil do end 
Alphonsus shall possess the diadem 
that Amurack now wear upon his head 
sit down therefore and that receive of i 
the which the fate appoint unto thou 

thou king of heaven which by thy power divine 
do see the secret of each liver heart 
bear record now with what unwilling mind 
I do receive the crown of Aragon 

a rise Albinius king of Aragon 
crown by i who till my gasp ghost 
do part asunder from my breathless corpse 
will be thy shield against all man alive 
that for thy kingdom any way do strive 
now since we have in such a happy hour 
confirm three king come let we march with speed 
into the city for to celebrate 
with mirth and joy this blissful festival 

Welcome Belinus to thy cousin court 
who late arrival in such post pace 
do bring both joy and sorrow to we all 
sorrow because the fate have be so false 
to let Alphonsus drive thou from thy land 
and joy since that now mighty Mahomet 
have give i cause to recompense at full 
the sundry pleasure I receive of thou 
therefore Belinus do but ask and have 
for Amurack do grant whatever you crave 

thou second sun which with thy glimpse beam 
do clarify each corner of the earth 
Belinus come not as erst Midas do 
to mighty Bacchus to desire of he 
that whatsoever at any time he touch 
may turn be to gold incontinent 
nor do I come as Jupiter do erst 
unto the palace of Amphitrion 
for any fond or foul concupiscence 
which I do bear to Alcmena hue 
but as poor Saturn force by mighty jove 
to fly his country banish and forlorn 
do crave the aid of Troos king of Troy 
So come Belinus to high Amurack 
and if he can but once your aid obtain 
he turn with speed to Naples back again 

my aid Belinus do you doubt of that 
if all the man at arm of Africa 
of Asia likewise will sufficient be 
to press the pomp of that usurp mate 
assure thyself thy kingdom shall be thou 
if Mahomet say I unto the same 
for be I sure to vanquish all our foe 
and find such spoil in ransack their tent 
as never any keisar do obtain 
yet will I not set foot forth of this land 
if Mahomet our journey do withstand 

nor will Belinus for king Croesus trash 
wish Amurack to displease the god 
in pleasure i in such a trifle toy 
then mighty monarch if it be thy will 
get their consent and then the act fulfil 

you counsel well therefore Belinus haste 
and Claramount go bear he company 
with king Arcastus to the city wall 
then bend with speed unto the darksome grove 
where Mahomet this many a hundred year 
have prophesy unto our ancestor 
tell to his priest that Amurack your king 
be now select all his man at arm 
to set upon that proud Alphonsus troop 
the cause you know and can inform he well 
that make i take these bloody broil in hand 
and say that I desire their sacred god 
that Mahomet which rule all the sky 
to send i word and that most speedy 
which of we shall obtain the victory 
you Bajazet go post away apace 
to Syria Scythia and Albania 
to Babylon with Mesopotamia 
Asia Armenia and all other land 
which owe their homage to high Amurack 
charge all their king with expedition 
to gather up the choice man at arm 
which now remain in their dominion 
and on the twenty day of the same month 
to come and wait on Amurack their king 
at his chief city Constantinople 
tell they moreover that who so do fail 
nought else but death from prison shall he bail 
what heavenly music sound in my ear 
peace Amurack and hearken to the same 

now have our charm fulfil our mind full well 
high Amurack be lull fast asleep 
and doubt I not but ere he wake again 
you shall perceive Medea do not gibe 
whenas she put this practice in your mind 
sit worthy Fausta at thy spouse his foot 
Iphigina sit thou on the other side 
whatever you see be not aghast thereat 
but bear in mind what Amurack do chat 
thou which be wont in Agamemnon day 
to utter forth Apollo oracle 
at sacred Delphos Calchas I do mean 
I charge thou come all linger set aside 
unless the penance you thereof abide 
I conjure thou by Pluto loathsome lake 
by all the hag which harbour in the same 
by stink Styx and filthy Phlegeton 
to come with speed and true to fulfil 
that which Medea to thou straight shall will 

thou wretched witch when will thou make a end 
of trouble we with these thy curse charm 
what mean thou thus to call i from my grave 
shall never my ghost obtain his quiet rest 

yes Calchas yes your rest do now approach 
Medea mean to trouble thou no more 
whenas thou have fulfil her mind this once 
go get thou hence to Pluto back again 
and there inquire of the destiny 
how Amurack shall speed in these his war 
peruse their book and mark what be decree 
by jove himself and all his fellow god 
and when thou know the certainty thereof 
by fleshless vision show it present 
to Amurack in pain of penalty 

force by thy charm though with unwilling mind 
I haste to hell the certainty to find 

now peerless prince I must needs be go 
my hasty business call i from this place 
there rest nought but that you bear in mind 
what Amurack in this his fit do say 
for mark what dream madam he do prate 
assure yourself that that shall be his fate 

though very loath to let thou so depart 
farewell Medea easer of my heart 

what Amurack do thou begin to nod 
be this the care that thou have of thy war 
as when thou shall be prance of thy steed 
to egg thy soldier forward in thy war 
thou sit mope by the fire side 
see where thy viceroy grovel on the ground 
look where Belinus breathe forth his ghost 
behold by million how thy man do fall 
before Alphonsus like to silly sheep 
and can thou stand still laze in this sort 
no proud Alphonsus Amurack do fly 
to quail thy courage and that speedy 
and do thou think thou proud injurious God 
Mahu I mean since thy vain prophecy 
lead Amurack into this doleful case 
to have his princely foot in iron clap 
which erst the proud king be force to kiss 
that thou shall escape unpunished for the same 
no no assoon as by the help of jove 
I escape this bondage down go all thy grove 
thy altar tumble round about the street 
and whereas erst we sacrifice to thou 
now all the turk thy mortal foe shall be 
behold the gem and jewel of my age 
see where she come who heavenly majesty 
do far surpass the brave and gorgeous pace 
which Cytherea daughter unto jove 
do put in ure whenas she have obtain 
the golden apple at the shepherd hand 
see worth Fausta where Alphonsus stand 
who valiant courage can not daunt be 
bridle my thought and press down my rage 
in recompense of which my good intent 
I have receive this woeful banishment 
woeful say I nay happy I do mean 
if that be happy which do set one free 
for by this mean I do not doubt ere long 
but Fausta shall with ease revenge her wrong 
Come daughter come my mind foretell i 
that Amurack shall soon requite be 

Fausta what mean this sudden flight of you 
why do you leave your husband princely court 
and all alone pass through these thick grove 
more fit to harbour brutish savage beast 
then to receive so high a queen as you 
although your credit will not stay your step 
from bend they into these darkish den 
yet shall the danger which be imminent 
to every one which pass by these path 
keep you at home with fair Iphigina 
what foolish toy have tickle you to this 
I great fear some hap have hit amiss 

no toy Medea tickle Fausta head 
nor foolish fancy lead i to these group 
but earnest business egg my tremble step 
to pass all danger whatsoever they be 
I banish be Medea I which erst 
be empress over all the triple world 
be banish now from palace and from pomp 
but if the god be favourer to i 
ere twenty day I will revenge be 

I think as much when first from thick leave 
I see you trudge in such post pace 
but to the purpose what may be the cause 
of this strange and sudden banishment 

the cause ask you a simple cause god wot 
it be neither treason nor yet felony 
but for because I blame his foolishness 

I hear you say so but I great fear 
ere that your tale be bring unto a end 
you will prove yourself the author of the same 
but pray be brief what folly do your spouse 
and how will you revenge your wrong on he 

what folly quoth you such as never yet 
be hear or see since Phoebus first begin shine 
you know how he be gather in all haste 
his man at arm to set upon the troop 
of proud Alphonsus yea you well do know 
how you and I do do the best we can 
to make he show we in his drowsy dream 
what afterward shall happen in his war 
much talk he have which now I have forget 
but at the length this sure be decree 
how that Alphonsus and Iphigina 
shall be conjoin in Juno sacred rite 
which when I hear as one that do despise 
that such a traitor shall be son to i 
I do rebuke my husband Amurack 
and since my word can take no better place 
my sword with help of all Amazon 
shall make he soon repent his foolishness 

this be the cause then of your banishment 
and now you go unto Amazon 
to gather all your may den in array 
to set upon the mighty Amurack 
o foolish queen what mean you by this talk 
those prattle speech have undo you all 
do you disdain to have that mighty prince 
I mean Alphonsus count for your son 
I tell you Fausta he be bear to be 
the ruler of a mighty monarchy 
I must confess the power of Amurack 
be great his confine stretch both far and near 
yet be they not the three part of the land 
which shall be rule by Alphonsus hand 
and yet you deign to call he son in law 
but when you see his sharp and cut sword 
pierce the heart of this your gallant girl 
you will curse the hour wherein you do denay 
to join Alphonsus with Iphigina 

the god forbid that ere it happen so 

nay never pray for it must happen so 

and be there then no remedy for it 

no none but one and that you have forswear 

as though a oath can bridle so my mind 
as that I dare not break a thousand oath 
for to eschew the danger imminent 
speak good Medea tell that way to i 
and I will do it whatsoever it be 

then as already you have well decree 
pack to your country and in readiness 
select the army of Amazon 
when you have do march with your female troop 
to Naples town to succour Amurack 
and so by marriage of Iphigina 
you soon shall drive the danger clean away 

so shall we soon eschew Charybdis lake 
and headlong fall to Sulla greedy gulf 
I vow before and now do vow again 
before I wed Alphonsus I will be slay 

in vain it be to strive against the stream 
fate must be follow and the god decree 
must needs take place in every kind of cause 
therefore fair maid bridle these brutish thought 
and learn to follow what the fate assign 
when Saturn hear that Jupiter his son 
shall drive he headlong from his heavenly seat 
down to the bottom of the dark Avernus 
he do command his mother present 
to do to death the young and guiltless child 
but what of that the mother loathe in heart 
for to commit so vile a massacre 
yea jove do live and as the fate do say 
from heavenly seat drive Saturn clean away 
what do avail the castle all of steel 
the which Acrisius cause to be make 
to keep his daughter Danae clog in 
she be with child for all her castle force 
and by that child Acrisius her sire 
be after slay so do the fate require 
a thousand example I can bring hereof 
but marble stone need no colour 
and that which every one do know for truth 
need no example to confirm the same 
that which the fate appoint must happen so 
though heavenly jove and all the god say no 

Iphigina she say nought but truth 
fate must be follow in their just decree 
and therefore set all delay aside 
come let we wend unto Amazon 
and gather up our force out of hand 

since Fausta will and fate do so command 
Iphigina will never it withstand 

my fellow priest of Mahound holy house 
what can you judge of these strange miracle 
which daily happen in this sacred seat 
hark what a rumble rattle in our care 
see flake of fire proceed from the mouth 
of Mahomet that God of peerless power 
nor can I tell with all the wit I have 
what Mahomet by these his sign do crave 

thrice ten time Phoebus with his golden beam 
have compass the circle of the sky 
thrice ten time Ceres have her workman hire 
and fill her barn with fruitful crop of corn 
since first in priesthood I do lead my life 
yet in this time I never hear before 
such fearful sound nor see such wondrous sight 
nor can I tell with all the wit I have 
what Mahomet by these his sign do crave 

you can tell nor will you seek to know 
o perverse priest how careless be you wax 
as when my foe approach unto my gate 
you stand still talk of I can tell 
go pack you hence and meet the turkish king 
which now be draw to my temple ward 
tell they from i God Mahomet be dispose 
to prophesy no more to Amurack 
since that his tongue be wax now so free 
as that it needs must chat and rail at i 

o Mahomet if all the solemn prayer 
which from our childhood we have offer thou 
can make thou call this sentence back again 
bring not thy priest into this dangerous state 
for when the Turk do hear of this repulse 
we shall be sure to die the death therefore 

thou say truth go call the prince in 
I will prophesy unto they for this once 
but in such wise as they shall neither boast 
nor you be hurt in any kind of wise 

you king of Turkey Mahomet our god 
by sacred science have notice that 
you be send legate from high Amurack 
unto this place command we his priest 
that we shall cause you make as much speed 
as well you may to hear for certainty 
of that shall happen to your king and you 

for that intent we come into this place 
and since that the mighty Mahomet 
be now at leisure for to tell the same 
let we make haste and take time while we may 
for much danger happen through delay 

truth worthy king and therefore you yourself 
with your companion kneel before this place 
and listen well what Mahomet do say 

as you do will we joint will obey 

prince of Turkey and ambassador 
of Amurack to mighty Mahomet 
I needs must muse that you which erst have be 
the ready soldier of the triple world 
be now become so slack in your affair 
as when you shall with bloody blade in hand 
be hack helm in thick of your foe 
you stand still loiter in the turkish soil 
what know you not how that it be decree 
by all the god and chief by myself 
that you with triumph shall all crown be 
make haste king lest when the fate do see 
how careless you do neglect their word 
they call a counsel and force Mahomet 
against his will some other thing to set 
Send Fabius back to Amurack again 
to haste he forward in his enterprise 
and march you on with all the troop you have 
to Naples ward to conquer Aragon 
for if you stay both you and all your man 
must needs be send down straight to limbo den 

muse not brave king at Mahomet discourse 
for mark what he forth of that mouth do say 
assure yourself it needs must happen so 
therefore make haste go mount you on your steed 
and set upon Alphonsus present 
so shall you reap great honour for your pain 
and escape the scourge which else the fate ordain 

then proud Alphonsus look thou to thy crown 
Belinus come in glitter armour clad 
all ready press for to revenge the wrong 
which not long since you offer unto he 
and since we have god Mahu on our side 
the victory must needs to we betide 

worthy Belinus set such threat away 
and let we haste as fast as horse can trot 
to set upon presumptuous Aragon 
you Fabius have as Mahu do command 
to Amurack with all the speed you may 

with willing mind I hasten on my way 

And think long till that we be in fight 
Belinus haste to quail Alphonsus might 

no soon have god Phoebus brightsome beam 
both Milan land and all the part thereof 

why then I doubt not but you can resolve 
i of a question that I shall demand 

I that I can whatever that it be 

then to be brief not twenty winter past 
when these my limb which wither be with age 
be in the prime and spring of all their youth 
I still desirous as young gallant be 
to see the fashion of Arabia 
my native soil and in this pilgrim weed 
begin to travel through unkenned land 
much ground I pass and many soil I see 
but when my foot in Milan land I set 
such sumptuous triumph daily there I see 
as never in my life I find the like 
I pray good sir what may the occasion be 
that make the Milan make such mirth and glee 

this solemn joy whereof you now do speak 
be not solemnize my friend in vain 
for at that time there come into the land 
the happy tiding that they ere do hear 
for news be bring upon that solemn day 
unto our court that Ferdinandus proud 
be slay himself Carinus and his son 
be banish both for ever from Aragon 
and for these happy news that joy be make 

but what I pray do afterward become 
of old Carinus with his banish son 
what hear you nothing of they all this while 

yes too too much the Milan duke may say 
Alphonsus first by secret mean do get 
to be a soldier in Belinus war 
wherein he do behave himself so well 
as that he get the crown of Aragon 
which be get he dispossess also 
the king Belinus which have foster he 
as for Carinus he be dead and go 
I will his son be his companion 

a blister build upon that traitor tongue 
but for thy friendship which thou show i 
take that of i I frank give it thou 
now will I haste to Naples with all speed 
to see if fortune will so favour i 
to view Alphonsus in his happy state 

Fabius come hither what be that thou say 
what do god Mahu prophesy to we 
why do our viceroy wend unto the war 
before their king have notice of the same 
what do they think to play bob fool with i 
or be they wax so frolic now of late 
since that they have the lead of our band 
as that they think that mighty Amurack 
dare do no other than to soothe they up 
why speak thou not what fond or frantic fit 
do make those careless king to venture it 

pardon dear lord no frantic fit at all 
no frolic vain nor no presumptuous mind 
do make your viceroy take these war in hand 
but force they be by Mahound prophecy 
to do the same or else resolve to die 

so sir I hear you but can scare believe 
that Mahomet will charge they go before 
against Alphonsus with so small a troop 
who number far exceed king Xerxes troop 

yes noble lord and more than that he say 
that ere that you with these your warlike man 
shall come to bring your succour to the field 
Belinus Claramount and Arcastus too 
shall all be crown with crown of beat gold 
and bear with triumph round about their tent 

with triumph man do Mahu tell they so 
provost go carry Fabius present 
unto the Marshalsea there let he rest 
clap sure and safe in fetter all of steel 
till Amurack discharge he from the same 
for be he sure unless it happen so 
as he do say Mahu do prophesy 
by this my hand forthwith the slave shall die 

stay provost stay let Fabius alone 
more fit now that every lusty lad 
be buckle on his helmet than to stand 
in carry soldier to the Marshalsea 

why what be thou 
that dare once presume 
for to gainsay that Amurack do bid 

I be my lord 
the wretched man alive 
bear underneath the planet of mishap 
erewhile a soldier of Belinus band 
but now 

what now 

the mirror of mishap 
who captain be slay and all his army dead 
only except i unhappy wretch 

what news be this and be Belinus slay 
be this the crown which Mahomet do say 
he shall with triumph wear upon his head 
be this the honour which that curse god 
do prophesy shall happen to they all 
o Daedalus and be thou now alive 
to fasten wing upon high Amurack 
Mahu shall know and that for certainty 
that turkish king can brook no injury 

tush tush my lord 
I wonder what you mean 
thus to exclaim against high Mahomet 
I will lay my life that ere this day be pass 
you shall perceive his tiding all be waste 

we shall perceive accurse Fabius 
suffice it not that thou have be the man 
that first do beat those babble in my brain 
but that to help i forward in my grief 
thou seek to confirm so foul a lie 
go get thou hence and tell thy traitorous king 
what gift you have which do such tiding bring 
and now my lord since nothing else will serve 
buckle your helm clap on your steel coat 
mount on your steed take lance in your hand 
for Amurack do mean this very day 
proud Mahomet with weapon to assay 

mercy high monarch it be no time now 
to spend the day in such vain threaten 
against our god the mighty Mahomet 
more fit thou to place thy man at arm 
in battle ray for to withstand your foe 
which now be draw towards you with speed 
hark how their drum with dubadub do come 
to arm high lord and set these trifle by 
that you may set upon they valiant 

and do they come you king of Turkey 
now be the time in which your warlike arm 
must raise your name above the starry sky 
call to your mind your predecessor act 
who martial might this many a hundred year 
do keep those fearful dog in dread and awe 
and let your weapon show Alphonsus plain 
that though that they be clap up in clay 
yet there be branch spring up from those tree 
in turkish land which brook no injury 
beside the same remember with yourselves 
what foe we have not mighty Tamburlaine 
nor soldier train up among the war 
but fearful body pick from their rural flock 
which till this time be whole ignorant 
what weapon mean or bloody Mars do crave 
more will I say but horse that be free 
do need no spur and soldier which themselves 
long and desire to buckle with the foe 
do need no word to egg they to the same 
beside the same behold whereas our foe 
be march towards we most speedy 
courage my lord we be the victory 

thou pagan dog how dare thou be so bold 
to set thy foot within Alphonsus land 
what be thou come to view thy wretched king 
who traitorous head bedeck my tent so well 
or else thou hear that on top thereof 
there be a place leave vacant be thou come 
to have thy head possess the high seat 
if it be so lie down and this my sword 
shall present that honour thou afford 
if not pack hence or by the heaven I vow 
both thou and thou shall very soon perceive 
that he that seek to move my patience 
must yield his life to thou for recompense 

why proud Alphonsus think thou Amurack 
who mighty force do terrify the god 
can ere be find to turn his heel and fly 
away for fear from such a boy as thou 
no no although that mar this much while 
have fortify thy weak and feeble arm 
and fortune oft have view with friendly face 
thy army march victor from the field 
yet at the presence of high Amurack 
fortune shall change and mar that God of might 
shall succour i and leave Alphonsus quite 

Pagan I say thou great be deceive 
I clap up fortune in a cage of gold 
to make she turn her wheel as I think best 
and as for Mars who you do say will change 
he mope sit behind the kitchen door 
press at command of every scullion mouth 
who dare not stir nor once to move a whit 
for fear Alphonsus then shall stomach it 

blasphemous dog I wonder that the earth 
do cease from rent underneath thy foot 
what froward fortune happen on your side 
I hope your king in safety do abide 

I noble madam Amurack do live 
and long I hope he shall enjoy his life 
but yet I fear unless more succour come 
we shall both lose our king and sovereign 

how so king Crocon do thou speak in jest 
to prove if Fausta will lament his death 
or else have any thing happen he amiss 
speak quick Crocon what the cause may be 
that thou do utter forth these word to i 

then worthy Fausta know that Amurack 
our mighty king and your approve spouse 
prick with desire of everlasting fame 
as he be press in the thick rank 
of Arragonian be with much ado 
at length take prisoner by Alphonsus hand 
so that unless you succour soon do bring 
you lose your spouse and we shall want our king 

o hapless hap o dire and cruel fate 
what injury have Amurack my sire 
do to the god which now I know be wroth 
although unjust and without a cause 
for well I wot not any other king 
which now do live or since the world begin 
do sway a sceptre have a great care 
to please the god then mighty Amurack 
and for to quite our father great good will 
seek they thus base all his fame to spill 

Iphigina leave off these woeful tune 
it be not word can cure and ease this wound 
but warlike sword not tear but sturdy spear 
high Amurack be prisoner to our foe 
what then think you that our Amazon 
join with the force of the turkish troop 
be not sufficient for to set he free 
yes daughter yes I mean not for to sleep 
until he be free or we he company keep 
march on my mate 

how now Alphonsus you which never yet 
can meet your equal in the feat of arm 
how hap it now that in such sudden sort 
you fly the presence of a silly maid 
what have you find my arm of such a force 
as that you think your body overweak 
for to withstand the fury of my blow 
or do you else disdain to fight with i 
for stain of your high nobility 

no dainty dame I will not have thou think 
that ever thou or any other wight 
shall live to see Alphonsus fly the field 
from any king or keisar who some ere 
first will I die in thick of my foe 
before I will disbase my honour so 
nor do I scorn thou god for to stain 
my prowess with thou although it be a shame 
for knight to combat with the female sect 
but love sweet mouse have so benumb my wit 
that though I will I must refrain from it 

I think as much when first I come to war 
your noble act be fit to be write 
within the table of dame Venus sun 
then in God mar his warlike register 
whenas your lord be hack helm es abroad 
and make their spear to shiver in the air 
your mind be busy in fond Cupid toy 
Come on i'faith I will teach you for to know 
we come to fight and not to love I trow 

nay virgin stay and if thou will vouchsafe 
to entertain Alphonsus simple suit 
thou shall ere long be monarch of the world 
all christen king with all your pagan dog 
shall bend their knee unto Iphigina 
the indian soil shall be thou at command 
where every step thou set on the ground 
shall be receive on the golden mine 
rich Pactolus that river of account 
which do descend from top of Tivole mount 
shall be thy own and all the world beside 
if you will grant to be Alphonsus bride 

Alphonsus bride nay villain do not think 
that fame or riches can so rule my thought 
as for to make i love and fancy he 
who I do hate and in such sort despise 
as if my death can bring to pass his bane 
I will not long from Pluto port remain 

nay then proud peacock since thou be so stout 
as that entreaty will not move thy mind 
for to consent to be my wed spouse 
thou shall in spite of god and fortune too 
serve high Alphonsus as a concubine 

I will rather die then ever that shall hap 

and thou shall die unless it come to pass 

nay Amurack this be no time to jar 
although thy wife do in her frantic mood 
use speech which may better have be spare 
yet do thou not judge the same time to be 
a season to requite that injury 
more fit thou with all the wit thou have 
to call to mind which way thou may release 
thyself thy wife and fair Iphigina 
forth of the power of stout Alphonsus hand 
for well I wot since first you breathe breath 
you never be so nigh the snare of death 
now Amurack your high and kingly seat 
your royal sceptre and your stately crown 
your mighty country and your man at arm 
be conquer all and can no succour bring 
put then no trust in these same paltry toy 
but call to mind that thou a prisoner be 
clap up in chain who life and death depend 
upon the hand of thy most mortal foe 
then take thou heed that what some ere he say 
thou do not once presume for to gainsay 

away you fool think you your cursedcharm 
can bridle so the mind of Amurack 
as that he will stand croach to his foe 
no no be sure that if that beggar brat 
do dare but once to contrary my will 
I will make he soon in heart for to repent 
that ere such word against Amurack he spend 

then since thou do disdain my good advice 
look to thyself and if you fare amiss 
remember that Medea counsel give 
which may you safe from all those peril save 
but Fausta you as well you have begin 
beware you follow still your friend advise 
if that Alphonsus do desire of thou 
to have your daughter for his wed spouse 
beware you do not once the same gainsay 
unless with death he do your rashness pay 

no worthy wight first Fausta mean to die 
before Alphonsus she will contrary 

why then farewell but you Iphigina 
beware you do not oversqueamish wax 
whenas your mother give her consent 

the god forbid that ere I shall gainsay 
that which Medea bid i to obey 

now Amurack the proud blasphemous dog 
for so you term we which do brawl and rail 
against God mar and fickle fortune wheel 
have get the goal for all your solemn prayer 
yourself be prisoner which as then do think 
that all the force of the triple world 
be insufficient to fulfil the same 
how like you this be fortune of such might 
or have God mar such force or power divine 
as that he can with all the power he have 
set thou and thou forth of Alphonsus hand 
I do not think but that your hope so small 
as that you will with very willing mind 
yield for my spouse the fair Iphigina 
on that condition that without delay 
Fausta and you may scotfree escape away 

what think thou villain that high Amurack 
bear such a mind as for the fear of death 
he will yield his daughter yea his only joy 
into the hand of such a dunghill knight 
no traitor no for as now I lie 
clap up in iron and with bolt of steel 
yet do there lurk within the turkish soil 
such troop of soldier that with small ado 
they will set i scotfree from your man and you 

villain say thou traitor and dunghill knight 
now by the heaven since that thou do deny 
for to fulfil that which in gentle wise 
Alphonsus crave both thou and all thy train 
shall with your life requite that injury 
Albinius lay hold of Amurack 
and carry he to prison present 
there to remain until I do return 
into my tent for by high jove I vow 
unless he wax more calm out of hand 
his head among his fellow king shall stand 

no villain think not that the fear of death 
shall make i calm while I draw my breath 

now Laelius take you Iphigina 
her mother Fausta with these other king 
and put they into prison several 
for Amurack stout stomach shall undo 
both he himself and all his other crew 

o sacred prince if that the saltbrine tear 
distil down poor Fausta wither cheek 

what never a word Alphonsus be thou dumb 
or do my presence so perturb thy mind 
that for because I come in pilgrim weed 
you think each word which you do spend to i 
a great disgrace unto your name to be 
why speak thou not if that my place you crave 
I will be go and you my place shall have 

nay father stay the god of heaven forbid 
that ere Alphonsus shall desire or wish 
to have his absence who he do account 
to be the Loadstone of his life 
what though the fate and fortune both in one 
have be content to call your love son 
from beggar state unto this princely seat 
shall I therefore disdain my age sire 
no first both crown and life I will detest 
before such venom breed within my breast 
what erst I do the sudden joy I take 
to see Carinus in such happy state 
do make i do and nothing else at all 
high jove himself do I to witness call 

these word be vain I know as much before 
but yet Alphonsus I must wonder needs 
that you who year be proof to Cupid snare 
can suffer such a goddess as this dame 
thus for to shed such store of crystal tear 
believe i son although my year be spend 
her sigh and sob in twain my heart do rent 

like power dear father have she over i 
until for love I look to receive 
love back again not only be deny 
but also taunt in most spiteful sort 
which make i loathe that which I erst do love 
as she herself with all her friend shall prove 

how now Alphonsus you which have so long 
be train up in bloody broil of Mars 
what know you not that castle be not win 
at first assault and woman be not woo 
when first their suitor proffer love to they 
as for my part I shall account that maid 
a wanton wench unconstant lewd and light 
that yield the field before she venture fight 
especial unto her mortal foe 
as you be then unto Iphigina 
but for because I see you fit be 
to enter list and combat with your foe 
then court fair lady in God Cupid tent 
Carinus mean your spokesman for to be 
and if that she consent you shall agree 

what you command 
Alphonsus must not fly 
though otherwise perhaps he will deny 

then dainty damsel stint these trickle tear 
cease sigh and sob yea make a merry cheer 
your pardon be already purchase 
so that you be not over curious 
in grant to Alphonsus just demand 

thank mighty prince no curious I will be 
then do become a maid of my degree 

the god forbid that ere Carinus tongue 
shall go about to make a maid consent 
unto the thing which modesty deny 
that which I ask be neither hurt to thou 
danger to parent nor disgrace to friend 
but good and honest and will profit bring 
to thou and those which lean unto that thing 
and that be this since first Alphonsus eye 
do hap to glance upon your heavenly hue 
and see the rare perfection of the same 
he have desire to become your spouse 
now if you will unto the same agree 
I dare assure you that you shall be free 

pardon dear lord the world go very hard 
when woman kind be force for to woo 
if that your son have love i so well 
why do he not inform i of the same 

why do he not what have you clean forget 
what ample proffer he do make to you 
when hand to hand he do encounter you 

no worthy sir I have not it forget 
but Cupid can enter in the breast 
where mar before have take possession 
that be no time to talk of Venus game 
when all our fellow be press in the war 

well let that pass now can thou be content 
to love Alphonsus and become his spouse 

i if the high Alphonsus can vouchsafe 
to entertain i as his wed spouse 

if that he can what do thou doubt of that 
jason do jet whenas he have obtain 
the golden fleece by wise Medea art 
the greek rejoice when they have subdue 
the famous bulwark of most stately Troy 
but all their mirth be nothing in respect 
of this my joy since that I now have get 
that which I long desire in my heart 

but what say Fausta to her daughter choice 

Fausta do say the god have be her friend 
to let she live to see Iphigina 
bestow so unto her heart content 

thank mighty empress for your gentleness 
and if Alphonsus can at any time 
with all his power requite this courtesy 
you shall perceive how kind he do take 
your forwardness in this his happy chance 

Albinius go call forth Amurack 
we will see what he do say unto this match 
most mighty Turk I with my warlike son 
Alphonsus loathe that so great a prince 
as you shall live in such unseemly sort 
have send for you to proffer life or death 
life if you do consent to our demand 
and death if that you dare gainsay the same 
your wife high Fausta with Iphigina 
have give consent that this my warlike son 
shall have your daughter for his bedfellow 
now rest nought but that you do agree 
and so to purchase sure tranquillity 

now Amurack advise thou what thou say 
bethink thou well what answer thou will make 
thy life and death depend on thy word 
if thou deny to be Alphonsus sire 
death be thy share but if that thou consent 
thy life be save consent nay rather die

into the hand of such a beggar brat 
what Amurack thou do deceive thyself
