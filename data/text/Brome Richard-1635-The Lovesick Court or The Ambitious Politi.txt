he may command their knee but I their heart 

Stratocles Justinius Disanius sit 
my lord although our law of Thessaly 
to you as well as to ourselves be know 
and all our custom yet for order sake 
I shall lay open one to you that be when 
a king decease without issue male 
as I unfortunate must the commons 
be to elect their king provide that 
he be of noble blood a soldier and one 
that have do public service for the crown 

that make for i 

or else the son of some 
great general slay in battle for his country 
as my Adrastus be 

o my brave brother 

Twenty year sorrow for that soldier loss 
have not wear out his memory 

your grace 
forget not then soldier of fresh fame 

some other time to boast good Stratocles 

it be good you will hear the king a general 
or a general son may be elect there 
your majesty leave 

or if the sonless king 
yet have a daughter and he match she in 
his life time to a husband that be noble 
he stand immediate heir unto the crown 
against all contradiction 

now think upon my service royal sir 

now think upon my nephew royal master 
the son of brave Adrastus who be slay 
twenty year since in fight of your battle 

it be good you will hear the king the husband of 
your daughter must be elect there you leave sir 

it rest now that a speedy choice be make 
of a fit husband one that may acquire 
eudyna love and people approbation 
the people for who noise I must not rest 
till my successor be appoint to they 
be wild till this election be make 
they have in arm make their demand and wait 
my present answer 

o here they come these be the principal 4 rustic 
the head the head forsooth they call themselves 
headcarpenter headsmith headplowman and headshepherd 

nay pray approach and seem no more abash 
here then among your giddyheaded rout 
where every man be a king and wage your power 
against i in foul defiance free speak 
your grievance and your full demand 

it be humble all express in this petition 

by all mean have a care that to any question we give the king good word to his face he be another manner of man here then we take he for at home 

I sweat for it I be sure I have scarce a dry thread in my leather lining 

they make we head in the country but if our headship now with all our country care shall be hang up at court for displease of this good king for the next king good our neck will not be set right again in the next king reign I take it 

my head itch to be at home again 

my head itch to be at home again 

my head and heart both ache for fear will 
I be honest hang out of the way to be rid on it 

there you may read my lord what we before 
find will be their demand it be for a king 
that must succeed i 

and because you have 
govern they long in peace by which they thrive 
their wisdom will have you entail that piece 
on they for after time and so they nominate 
ambitious Stratocles to be your heir 

envious Disanius my merit be 
their motive 

cease your strife you have stand more incline 
to lay your choice on Philocles or Philargus 
the twinborn son of long since slay Adrastus 

may it please your majesty we be inform 
that in their travail unto Delphos both 
of they be dead 

that information 
be mere by suggestion I dare speak it 
insinuate by Stratocles they both live 
and be upon return 

will we know that 
lord Stratocles then shall pardon we he be a man 
gracious among we but 

Philargus o 
Philargus be he living 

I say Philocles 
brave Philocles be the man 

false empty weathercock 

I say lord Stratocles be the man we know 
and ought to honour 

there live yet some hope 

what strange confusion this or whither will 
you run by several way Philargus one 
another Philocles a three cry Stratocles 
in this you say you will have no king at all 
this must be reconcile or you pull ruin 
upon yourselves he who the king be please 
to give his daughter to must be your king 

all that we crave and that upon our knee 
be that the king will gracious be please 
to make a speedy choice and give we leave 
with pardon to depart and signify 
his royal pleasure to the doubtful country 

tell they they shall expect then but a month 
in which short time my daughter marriage 
shall be consummate 

the god protect your majesty 

and now my lord the commons be at peace 
let i prevail your private jar to cease 

madam the cause be i it be mine to mourn 
in chief if they be dead they be your son 
it be true and though they be your only comfort 
upon this earth you but resign to heaven 
the blessing that it lend you but to i 
they be a pair of equal lover and 
by i so equal belove and by 
the king my father so above all man respect 
that I by either have be make a queen 
which title I for ever will disclaim 
if they be dead 

o my Philargus o my Philocles 
you god I know they do not seek your counsel 
nor dare to approach your altar but with all 
due reverence and require ceremony 
and can your delphian oracle when they 
be friendly competitioner for love 
answer they but with death 

the rumor madam 
carry so little show of truth that you 
do ill to take so deep a sense of it 
much worse to expostulate as if you have 
a injury do you by the god have you

and careful councelgiver and must I 
find cause to chide you now come dry these tear

I pray thou tell it

that I myself have tell in childbed chamber 
to restore spirit to the pallid flesh 
and I have be a woman as good at it 
without vain boast be it speak as any she 
in Thessaly that ere dare undertake 
the office of a midwife and that the queen

this chatter midwife glance at the knowledge 
of some strange hide thing which like as with 
a charm she keep my governess in awe with

the lady be right virtuous yet it may 
be worth my inquisition at fit time

who name be not voice with they yet by your favour 
great madam governess he have discharge 
the office of a governor over your son 
as well as you have over the king daughter 
and they have suck more of his Helicon 
then she have of your doctrine which their breed 
together with their travel through his care 
will testify I doubt not to my honour 
that have bring forth a son of such performance 

do not I say it be Stratocles that raise 
that hideous rumor of their death among 
his wild idolator in hope to gain 
election by their ignorance and rudeness 

it be well those factious head be wrought to come 
before the king to find his clemency 
and probable that these be live 

and how they then shrink in their neck from Stratocles 
it have so lay the flame of his ambition 
that these may safe now tread out the fire 

welcome again my princely nephew welcome 

thank courteous uncle 

you interrupt i brother 

good woman cry thou mercy mother be such thing 

why what thing be we mother 

o the old nightpiece with her dark lantern by she 

you will give we leave to take 
the comfort due unto we in our age 
for which we suffer sorrow in our youth 
our child be our child young or old 

So be my horse my horse 

you have reply 
as whilom do a counsellor at law 
who say his adverse advocate have plead 
to as much purpose as a hen in the forehead 

Geron thou be welcome thou still keep thy humour 
thy travel have not change thou thou come home 
as wise as thou go out 

so whilom say 
a miser have much increase his store 
he have as much still as he have before 

enough I will give thou over 

o my dear offspring every sight of you 
be a new recompense and satisfaction 
for all the pain and travel of your birth 
in you your father memory shall live 
beyond the malice of the grave and death 
and I when my rejoice shall be full 
and can take addition free yield 
my flesh to dust shall yet be bless by those 
who shall give testimony to your virtue 

it be a sufficient spur to noble action 
to be reward but with your content 
which to procure we make our business 

Philocles 
your brow be cloud have the oracle 
adjudge against you pray let we partake 
the knowledge of the delphian decree 
and which of you stand high in the favour 
of wise Apollo to be husband to 
princess Eudyna here the kingdom heir 
what speak the oracle 

such a verdict madam 
require a o Oedipus to construe it 
I neither know it nor be solicitous 
after the meaning 

wise speak pupil 
so whilom answer a egyptian porter 
to one demand what he bear conceal 
it be therefore cover that thou shall not know 
the case be alike 

pray let we hear it 
can your tutor Geron play the Hermes 
to interpret it 

I be not enigmatical 
but all for apothegm beside I say 
as whilom Aristippus of a riddle 
it be not safe to lose what be bind 
do trouble we so much 

let i come to it 

yes by all mean for as one whilom say 
the blind be best in the dark 

my lord your trump 
be ever shoot at i blind as I be 
I perceive that and make much of your riddle 
I know both what it can and will come to 
better without the sight of it than all 
you can with all your wise construction 
and so I leave you 

not in anger garrula 

madam you know I know I must take leave 
to take a nap 

and governor Geron wait upon your mother 
trust our care with your charge 

so whilom say 
a school boy when another raise his top 
let i alone myself can keep it up 

and now let i entreat that we may hear 
the hide sentence happy so many 
may guess at the intent 

she long to hear 
which of the two be prick to be her husband 

here it be if there be any thing 

let i be clerk I hope at least to read it 
contend not for the jewel which 
ere long shall both of you enrich 
pursue your fortune for it be she 
shall make you what you seem to be 
Apollo thy great wisdom have quite fool i 

nothing but contradiction 

as how Philocles 

he command here 
contend not for the jewel we agree 
Eudyna be the jewel which shall both of you enrich 
how shall she enrich we both can she be wife to we both 
then here he bid 
pursue your fortune and we both agree 
Eudyna be that fortune too she be both 
the jewel we must not contend for and 
the fortune we must both pursue then here 
he say it be she shall make we what we seem to be 
what do we seem we be no hypocrite 
in flesh or spirit no fantastic body 
or shadow of humanity 

no Delphos be but a den of juggler which profane 
abuse divinity and pretend a god 
their patron to authorise their delusion 

nephew the god have need be cautilous 
for what they speak if you may be their judge 

what think good Justinius 

my lord here be two command 
one that you not contend to gain the jewel 
the other that you both pursue your fortune 
both these command be thus to be obey 
contend not for she as to violate 
your unexampled friendship which you be 
renown for over all Greece and both pursue 
your fortune in she without either grudge 
at other happiness in her choice 

noble Justinius thank 

This we can do 

and for the happiness which we both aspire to 
we here confirm the friendship long since plight 
which never shall be break by Philargus 

noble Philargus 

So vow Philocles 
it be not the cloudy language of the god 
shall make our breast tempestuous or stormy 
but with the same serenity and quiet 
as heretofore our heart shall mingle still 
and fortify their truce let the event 
expound their riddle if good it be our merit 
if bad we know our virtue can correct it 
mean time Philargus take the word of Philocles 
that though there be no happiness on earth 
I can esteem above Philargus friendship 
but fair eudyna love which only be 
the treasure I can covet from Philargus 
and can look to live but to enjoy it 
rather than justle with his friendship I 
will die to lose it 

noble Philocles 

you have make my vow my brother Philocles 
and friend which be above it I will seek 
and rather die than fail to gain her love 
but that and the whole kingdom in addition 
must divide our friendship or affection 
as we be twin in birth we will be in mind 
unto our late breath let Greece hereafter 
forget to mention the Tyndaride 
with their alternate deity and tell 
of two thessalian brother can refuse 
a happiness which only be not heaven 
in detestation of priority 
will not be happy because they may not share 
a individual both time and thing 

love and ambition I have hear man say 
admit no fellowship it hold not here 
these will have neither wife nor crown alone 
they each desire my love but neither can 
enjoy it unless he be the other man 
my love be double take yet must gain neither 
unless I can enjoy they both together o you god 
why make you they two person and assign 
to both but one inseparable mind 
or why be I mark out to be that one 
that love and must embrace or two or none 
oh my perplexity 

look to the princess 

madam how fare the life of goodness 

she sink dear mother sister bring your aid 

to keep the world alive give your assistance

have be so common among lady that 
the fashion stale and ugly 

so it must be 
and so by transposition of my love 
I shall be quiet and Philocles double happy 
Doris go seek my mother and perceive 
if I may see the princess 

yes my lord 

love thou be well compare to fire which where 
it do obey and serve be command 
by high power of the soul it fare 
like to the stone or jewel of a ring 
which join the orb and give it price and luster 
so glorious be that love so necessary 
but where it rule and be predominant 
it tyrannize reason be imprison 
the will confine and the memory 
the treasury of notion clean exhaust 
and all the sense slavish chain up 
to act the injunction of insult love 
parch on the beauty of a woman thou 
masculine love know by the name of friendship 
art peaceful and morigerous but that 
of woman be imperious and cruel 
why shall I then lose Philocles for Eudina 
why can I look on she and ask a reason 
o the divinity of woman sure 
there be no heaven without they if the god 
shall thrust out Jove as he depose his father 
and elect i to be their thunderer 
I will not drink nectar to forgo Eudina 

fie fie Philargus you be a sluggish lover 
I have be careful for you yea and partial 
against your brother Philocles to prefer 
your love to his and you to suffer he 
a whole hour opportunity before you 

have he be here 

and be only for you 
I have beguile he of her presence that 
till you have make first presentation 
of love to she he shall have no access 

now Philocles I suffer in thy injury 
and to proceed in it be treachery 
I will retire but that magnetic beauty 
to which be chain thousand of heart and eye 
have captive i nor must I seem to slight 
a mother care she be not the first it be know 
that of two son have best affect one 

why move you not Philargus towards the princess 

madam you see she be busy 

Stratocles 
may thy ambition hoist thou into air 
and thy loose wing like thy licentious paper 
there fail thou let fall thy vicious body 
to earth as here thy name lie to be tread on 
Philargus you be welcome 

princely madam 
that language from your gracious lip be powerful 
to save he from the grave that only live 
by your free favour 

nay my dear Philargus 
I think i near to you than that you 
shall rove at i with courtship Stratocles 
the emblem of who pride lie there in paper 
shoot from afar indeed yet like a Jove 
a selfconceited one presume to strike 
love by command into i by his letter 

I can flatter pride nor undervalue 
ability it be true that Stratocles 
have be a useful servant to the state 
but doubtless he will make as ill a master 

no more of he 

nor more be think of he 
and therefore madam by your fair command 
to avoid all courtcircumlocution 
I tender thus my service and crave hear 

you have it free 

to avoid all let 
I will withdraw myself 

the king have gracious be please in lieu 
of my slay father service and for love 
to we his son by we much undeserved 
to recommend unto your noble choice 
my brother and myself you stand doubtful 
whether to choose we to avoid dispute 
of violate friendship do implore 
the council of the oracle to direct 
you in the election but the hide sense 
in the dark sentence have perplex both you 
and we with more anxiety 

it be too true 

yet you be not prescribe your choice be free 
to take your lot in Philocles or i 
we both by strong injunction must pursue 
your sacred love yet keep our friendship true 
then thus illustrious madam 

not so low 

as low as future duty must compel i 
when you shall be my queen let i beseech 
the favour that I seek and will obtain 
equal with heavenly bliss to shine on Philocles 

that he may be your king 

may he prove so 

be all example lose 

friendship with favour may 
hold between king and subject but one throne 
can estate two king love number be one 

o my Philargus you have open now 
the meaning of the oracle I have the sense 
most perfect you have beyond example 
preserve your friendship with your brother and 
in woo for he have win i to yourself 
I be your own 

I be amid the god 
the wealth of the world the beauty of the heaven 
and power of both shall not redeem my interest 
provide that I lose not Philocles 

in that your constancy you win i more 

your importunity have prevail see Philocles 
the princess and Philargus 

o you be partial 

o help my brother speak dear Philocles 

you god how come this let i raise he up 
brother and friend speak it be Philargus call thou 

Philargus let i go it be your advantage 

let i request the cause of your disturbance 
good Philocles 

no other but myself 
honour Eudyna for who feed to danger 
upon a dish he love ought not to blame 
the meat but his unbridle appetite 

how do you now what a cold moisture 
spread over his temple here 

let i come to he 

I can read his grief 

what be that to the redress 

the delphian god medicine inventor know 
that and not I 

his grief be a jealous passion 
upon my suppose favour to Philargus 
shake it off Philocles I be thou as much 
as ere I be or he 

it be no jealousy 
only a fear Philargus have break friendship 
so my soul better part exit leave 
the other languish 

have you expire 
in that belief and I have understand it 
my shadow shall have post after you 
unto the elysian field to vindicate 
so causeless imputation 

and because 
you charge my son with partiality 
let we remove Philargus come Placilla 

you will not take he from i stay Philargus 

what will you do with both 

I may not stir 
when she who power above i countermand 
the precept of the god require my stay 

what not to give you brother Philocles 
a opportunity for equal hear 
your grace will not deny it he 

true I may not 

that spell convince all friendship above 
and must control obedience and love 
it be not to injure thou my dear Philargus 
that here I linger to oppose thy love 
but to prefer it 

what say Philocles 

to say I love you madam with a zeal 
that dare to meet the trial of martyrdom 
and suffer it for your sake may get a name 
a glorious one and a immortal crown 
yet so I shall forgo in leave you 
on earth a heaven on it the bliss 
which grieve I shall in Elysium miss 
no I will love you better than to die 
and be my own chief mourner yet must crave 
under your gracious favour leave to suffer 
more than a thousand death that be to live 
and part with my fair hope in you for ever 

what mean my Philocles 

princely madam 
consider the necessity which now 
by further search I gather from the hide 
oraculous perduit by which I be tie 
not to contend for you that be I must not 
wound friendship in Philargus but pursue 
my fortune which be to gain love from you 
for who it say not but the meaning plain 
I for Philargus shall your love obtain 
the god deal after as they please with i 
my suit be that you take Philargus 

o 
Philocles you have make a double conquest 
for you have get the victory of i 
which be before assign unto Philargus 
your fortune thus embrace you 

This now 
and with Philargus friendship be to i 
a fortune above the envy of the god 

he can disallow it he woo i for you 
and win i to himself as you have now 
sue for he 

I must not hold you then 
his title as his friendship precede i 

yet still the choice be i I may take you 
without offence to he but now he come 
and have again a equal interest 
strange love in other absence I take either 
and love each best now both at once appear 
neither be i fate let i die to one 
rather than live in this confusion 

now madam whether love do you approve 

confound i not with question they be each 
wed to other friendship either be 
more studious for the other than himself 

and ever must 

and will be 

so will I 
for both of you then for myself 

alas 

then let we continue thus with maiden love 
with modest freedom unsuspected joy 
as we have all be form in one womb 
till heaven determine of we 

to determine 
of you Eudyna be by heaven commit 
in present unto i on you depend 
the future glory and prosperity 
both of my house and kingdom it be beside 
exact of i by my near ally 
and by my subject who I must secure 
to constitute a successor and no long 
will I expect your answer than five day 
by then you must declare who be your husband 
or else expect one from myself the man 
who name I be as loath to mention 
as you to hear even Stratocles 

nay death first 

be you obedient and by the way 
take my approvement of lord Philocles 
not that I slight Philargus 

here be a mystery too 
as dark as that from Delphos he approve 
my choice of Philocles slight not Philargus 

Come both you equal brother leave she to 
her thought a while 

in all obedience 

what strange amazement have surprise you madam 
no study nor no strife can alter fate 
or the decree the god determinate 
a husband you shall have be confident 
be as you be secure of the event 
till time produce it 

madam be yourself 

yet five day for love war Jove grant I have 
by then to end the strife a peaceful grave 

will you thus offer by your own disease 
to shorten your mother day or can you pine 
and I not grieve or can grief kill i 
do you think 

a wise philosopher whilom do affirm 
that woman who have pass the fire of love 
have heart which grief can neither pierce ne move 

son your philosophy fail you as your love 
blind you for Cupid fire I know may be 
quench by old age but grief be unquenchable 
my tongue still falter with i there be my grief 
and there be not so many fathom betwixt 
a woman tongue and heart but grief may find 
the bottom but for care to keep it up 
by send down a antidote before it 

but whilom do the lovesick poet prove 
no antidote against the power of love 

forbear your whilom and your old say saw 
and since you be in love and by that love 
grow sick with the concealment 

as whilom 
the athenian boy who steal a fox do hide 
under his coat his theft from be descry 
until it tear his genitals his entrails 
I shall have say 

no more I say 
of your disease but to the cure which be 
the love of Doris how have you try she son 

by oratory epistle and by gift 
which whilom Ovid say be best of shift 

yes such a gift it may be and so fasten 

but she as whilom say anominus 
retort all with scorn injurious 

yet will you leave your whilom and go seek 
my lady governess say I will speak with she 

but whilom say Diogenes it be true 
to one that will I will not speak with you 

will you say as I say and do as you be bid 
it be not her great ladyship daughter handmaid 
shall scorn my son while I know what I know 
if you love Doris run and tell she so 

for Doris love as whilom Daedalus 
I will take wing but see I be prevent 

o garrula well find I be in quest of you 

and I be even a send for you madam 

what a imperious beldame be this but I 
must humour she send for i do you say 
for what good garrula

and say it again what what I know what I know 
you know I do and that there be no such 
distinction betwixt the honour of your birth 
and place and mine of age and knowledge but 
you may vouchsafe the summons when I send 

what need this garrula I be here you see 

you know I know and have deserve some favor 
I do not boast for what you know 

o i 
who trust those secret whereon honour rest 
to custody in mercenary breast 
do slave nobility and though they pay 
a daily ransom never redeem away 
pray let we be more private though indeed 
I love your son for his great care of i 

o do you so go forth son Geron till 
I call all shall go well I will warrant thou 

whilom so 
say a physician mean to restore 
and kill the patient be but sick before 

why garrula do you maintain a strife 
still in my grieve mind betwixt hope and fear 
can so many year of my know kindness 
win yet a confidence of secrecy 
you be as deep bind by oath too as myself 

I do confess my oath and will not break it 
yet madam as you be a woman you 
may know a break oath be no such burden 
as a great secret be beside the tickle 
a woman have to in and out with it o 
the tongue itch be intolerable and be I 
a woman of tongue as most be of my calling 
though midwife have be hold the best at secret 
councel keep it have be out I fear 

but still take heed dear garrula 

yes madam 
yet there be kindness require on your part 

have I not still be kind 

my memory serve i and but that my tongue 
now falter with i I can recount 
all the reward I have have from time to time 
since you translate i from a country housewife 
into the midwife royal what in gown 
in gold in jewel chain and ring and which 
I prize above all my syrup and my sipping 

your place of honour in the court 

what what 
I hope I have that before in the king favour 
as his queen midwife she be in Elysium 

then garrula your learned son preferment 
tutor and governor to my son 

thereby 
hang a tale madam now I come to the point 
my son affect your daughter handmaid Doris 
who slight his love I must now by your power 
obtain she for my son 

be confident 
though I confess I hold her worthless of he 

I tell he so but love have blind he 
ho Geron I say Geron come and hear 

so whilom prisoner have be call to come 
from dungeon deep to hear a black doom 

Geron be comfort by all my power 
Doris shall be your own 

then whilom as 
Ovid his Corynna sweet say o 
she come she come my joy do overflow 

now Doris what portend your haste speak maid 
be it to Geron or to i your business 

his ill look have almost make i miscarry it 
madam the princess instant desire 
your company 

but by her grace favour 
and your leave Doris I will trench so far 
on both your patience and for your good 
as to be witness of a interchange 
of some few word betwixt Geron and yourself 
why look you from he so he love you Doris 

that be more than I ere know or read by all 
he speak or write to i he clothes his word 
in fur and hood so that I can find 
the naked meaning of his business madam 

speak plain to she Geron 

to her son 

my business be the same that whilom draw 
Demosthenes to Corinth some repentance 
so I pay not too dear 

Lo you there madam 

you must speak plain son 

and be you kind Doris 

but not so kind good madam as to grant 
I know not what 

o forfeit not the praise 
that whilom Aristotle give your sex 
to be enrich with piety and pity 

I know not what to pity but your want 
of utterance it be some horrid thing 
that you desire and be ashamed to speak it 

no gentle Doris nothing but the thing 
whereby great Alexander whilom say 
he know himself a mortal and no god 
coition 

be it what it will I can 
give what I understand not you be too aloof 

there be comfort son and I will give thou instruction 
to come more close to she 

I will ease your care 
and be myself his agent he be too learned 
Geron you speak too learned as if 
you woo a muse and Doris understand not 
but by your posture what you will have I will put 
your meaning into woman word and such 
as shall be sure to speed but first I will wait 
upon the princess garrula will you go 

and thank you for my son but still I know 

nay I will do it Geron be confident 

I thank your ladyship as much as they 
who whilom whilom 

know not what to say 

he be overjoy 

go Geron lead the way 

pray trouble i no further I have say 
that if in five day space she make not choice 
of one of those who I must tell you Stratocles 
she love and I prefer before you then 
I will weigh your suit and reason and till then 
I say it again you be a trouble to i 

a trouble sir that be a time that know i 
a trouble to your enemy not you 
when this same lump of earth which now be a trouble 
stand a sole bulwark of your realm repel 
arm of foe shroud your fearful subject 
under my shield guard your field and vineyard 
from desolation your palace from ruin 
and be I now a trouble 

Stratocles 
you lose the glory of your deed by blaze 
your own renown he that commend himself 
speak upon trust and be his hearer slave 

peace envy and be thankful for thy life 
which thy tongue forfeit 

let my mildness tell you 
you be irreverent before the king 
who have not be forgetful of your worth 
nor slow in your reward then moderate 
your heat with counsel and be first assistant 
unto the public good so shall you merit 
the first regard in honour and affair 
of private nature 

So 

this oracle 
trouble i not a little I have think 
thereby to have decline this weighty care 
from my decline shoulder and have give 
my country satisfaction and myself 
in choose of a son and successor 
but I be prisoner in the labyrinth 
of the god verdict 

their sublimity 
in matter of the future seldom stoop 
to humane apprehension yet vouchsafe 
to answer our demand but chide withal 
our too much incense with obscurity 
your grace however may presume where they 
shall deign to spend a word and take a offering 
it be a certain augury of good 

thou have allay my fear Justinus come 
lead i thy brain assistance for in thou 
I find a temper that accord with i 

soldier I dare yet tell thou thou be rash 
foolish as valiant and as easy may 
for all thy lostiness be undermine 
as the base bramble boast weakness thou 
and promise ambition lead thou up 
a earthly exhalation into the air 
where with a little borrow light one moment 
thou shine the mark and wonder of all eye 
but soon consume and dart to the centre 
become the scorn of man and sport of child 

you be oath sect of cynic and have learn 
to bark philosophy 

then shall you hear 
your now adorn multitude upbraid 
your insolence and pride and gain the name 
of prophet by your downfall while one swear 
he have foretell it long another dream it 
all joint cry we never can endure he 
see what a look he have what brawny lip 
what poisonous eye and what a impudent front 

you will outrun your privilege of prate 
and suffer for it 

I be too prodigal 
of seed upon so flinty soil as thou 
be as thou be and perish 

ignorant wretch 
that out of all thy bookish theory 
know not the soul to be aerial 
and of a soar nature not unlike 
the noble falcon that will never cease 
to work above all that top she the supreme 
estate on earth and next unto the god 
be majesty and that be my present gain 
though I have all but that yet want that 
all be as none to i and since my way 
must be upon the ruin sour Disanius 
of thou and of thy glory in thy nephew 
the king dear darling for who precious sake 
I must attend five day yet be a trouble 
I will travail through your blood thyself have give i 
the quick motion by thy timely envy 
thou have set spur to the pale horse of death 
that into dust shall trample all those let 
which stand betwixt i and the thessalian crown 
upon who back I will set this rider 

my sovereign lord 

I like that compellation 
thou still i as thou wish i on who 
depend thy consequent advancement Matho 
but we but dream of sovereignty and sleep 
to the achievement something must be do 
with wakeful eye and ready hand my Matho 

now my king speak himself let but your eye 
find out the way these ready hand shall act 
the strength of your design I can perceive 
that now the labour of your jovelike brain 
be bring forth the Pallas shall inspire 
i to perform the work of my advancement 

it be not yet ripe for the delivery 
but thou shall quick have it follow i 

good madam let i be excuse the mirth 
you offer to allay or quench my sorrow 
may have be well receive at former time 
but now it be unseasonable 

yet think on it madam 
how grave Geron go and with what scorn 
the wanton girl recoil 

good speak no more on it 

then beldame garrula reason urge Doris 
show how either of his pupil grace 
in your elect Philocles or Philargus 
though to they doubtful be a sure advancement 
to she by Geron 

still you move like those 
that do in merry tale misspend their breath 
to those that be that day mark out for death 

you may not say so madam it be in you 
by take one to give new life to two 
yourself and if you will give i leave to name 
the other be it Philargus or if chance 
shall favour better Philocles or he 
let it be he that give you the first visit 

that be to fancy in ourselves a oracle 
or to give fortune power to execute 
the judgement of the delphian god 

who know 
but that his oracle will have it so 

be it for that you now send for Philargus 

say shall it be so madam or suppose so 

This please better yet than Geron woo 
prithee Placilla sing and may thy voice 
attract he that may prove the happy choice 

I will try my best in note and what they want 
I will strive to make effectual in my wish 

thank kind Placilla but the leaden weight 
of sleep oppress my eyelid and I shall not hear thou 

yet sit and let she sing you will sleep the better 

stay Philocles stay Philargus let not fury 
lead you to end that difference with your sword 
which only fit my life to satisfy 

what mean your grace 

pursue they with prevention 
before they meet again or one or both 
must perish do you not observe their challenge 
and either dare other to the field 

who madam where and when 

now here your son 
how can you ask 

because we be awake 
and see nothing 

collect your spirit madam you sleep 

it be a ominous dream then 

and of good 
I dare divine it madam and now see 
who fortune first have send to be your choice 
Philargus you have win the glorious prize 

but do the glory of the world Eudina grant it 

my affrightment shake i still 
oh my Philargus I be now inspire 
sure by a vision from the god with knowledge 
that in my choice of you or Philocles 
I shall become the ruin of you both 

it be not in fate to wound our common friendship 

it be better in myself to kill the danger 

the god avert such purpose if you 
deprive the world of your fair self than we 
both fall by necessary consequence 
but what be we This Thessaly must suffer 
the king must yield to see a new and strange 
succession appoint to his crown 
and by his subject not himself 

it be that 
Deter i yet let i prevail Philargus 
to quit i of my fear that ere I pass 
my faith unto a husband you and Philocles 
before the god your mother and myself 
once more do celebrate your vow of friendship 
and let i be excuse in this for I 
must tell you dear Philargus that though now 
my love be fix on one of you albeit 
I name not which I will not take he with 
least scruple of a fear of lose he 
again by the other spite nor leave that other 
less love by i than now he be for ever 
and though but one can be possess of i 
one friendship yet must marry we all three 

the god have speak it in you it be their 
divine injunction madam I obey it 
and dare engage as much for Philocles

and palliate their wicked mystery 

how do you brother

you will hear more of his kindness to you short 

he suspect too with much displeasure my 
unreasonable love to Philocles 
but why shall we be reason follower 
with loss of liberty which of the creature 
alley his heat towards any of his kind 
because the same belly give they be they 
observe no difference of sire or dam

if you will all obey my rule and try 
your fortune who shall have i

if your lord win the princess and become 
the king immediate heir I will be you

it have relation to some uncouth passage 
betwixt they in my lady youth I guess 

it be some smocksecret I believe but gentleman 
you know how I have lay myself out to you 

that as the princess shall bestow herself 
on either lord you will embrace his man 

right 

and to that you will hold 

yes 
this for a creed that heaven must make its choice and hold you 
of one of they before she take the other 
you understand i and now cease your strife 
when the one lord be dead I will be the other wife 
so farewell gentleman I have stay too long 

she have give we both a hint now will we take it 

you do not hear i say kill you his lord 
nor you kill he 

but she have lay a ground 
to end a strife that I shall never have find 

Varillus come our lord may be return 
and we be shend for loiter 

I must think on it 

now for my combatant the appoint ground 
be here the time draw on and the event 
foresee in my imaginary light 
of every pass project in their fight 
in the first passage each shall wound the other 
then shall they give lend pay change wound for wound 
till both of they lie faint on the ground 
hold between their tooth their doubtful life 
when I to end the question friendly come in 
and with a equal hand dispatch they both 
and so into my ambush one approach 

this be the place what be it that urge i 
so prompt to deed which be act 
will be the astonishment of heaven and earth 
applaud nowhere but in hell fair Tempe 
let it not be derive to after age 
by any uncouth mark upon thy face 
let not thy grassy lock that shall receive 
the drop of blood wither and die condemn 
the place that bear they to continual baldness 
let not the impress of our labour foot 
hold it be proportion nor that part of earth 
whereon the slay shall measure out his length 
reserve the stamp and make it monumental 
by a perpetual spring of more procere 
and big blade grass and when my soul 
have find a exit which my purpose be 
my brother sword shall open let the valley 
when he be depart sink and undermine 
the border hill that they may cover i 

he have prevent i in haste in death 
I shall prevent his happy expect 
labour and toil who for no other end 
be here arrive but to be sacrifice 
for expiation of his discontent 

let all the eye of heaven be hood only 
one star to guide his point unto my heart 
which instant shall fall and be extinct 
in my distil blood that so the god 
may not behold he may some magic spell 
instruct his arm and weapon how to slay 
my name and memory that of i there be not 
any desire on he no imputation 

my cure be only how my breast may swallow 
his point without reveal my intent 

i so it shall be a violent assay 
for provocation and then spit myself 
upon his steel 

Philargus what so quick 

what be mean by this 

that shall be my demand 

be you so changeable 

not I Philargus 

this be my resolution 
will you stain 
the reputation raise of your high valour 

I come to make experiment of none 
but what consist in suffer 

that be my part

than which not great subject of a oath 
I swear to be your nuptial sacrifice 
be you the priest I will suffer without noise 
in my display bowel you shall read 
a augury of bliss unto you both

hold hold and be not prodigal of that blood 
more precious than Pactolus golden stream 

be then your challenge but to try i only

we wish your may be such 

and that this shame 
may guard you innocent of future blame

our country loyalty with discretion 
and not release he from our power but by

I can get a word give i my daughter 
or take my kingdom too where be she tell i 

all we can say or hear be she be take 
out of her private walk by violent hand 
only we guess the master of the plot 
be Stratocles who now be miss in the court

it be a fit gloss for his foul treachery 

but what have you say for her recovery

to every coast and angle of your kingdom 
no way of find she be leave unsought 

can we find Stratocles she may be find

be spread about the court they be go to fight 

against who 

against themselves nay more that they 
have fight and both be slay 

you may as soon 
believe the arctic and antarctic pole 
can meet it opposition amid 
the firmament and joint in a fall 
extinguish both their light in Neptune bosom 

whence spring this rumor 

Stratocles be the head 
we may be confident and his man the pipe 
that have disperse it

more than your kingdom to you 

away old fool 

now you shall never know it 

for thy good will 
the king will thank thou in offer at some mirth 
to cool his grief but that it be too hot

I will so souse in our best greekish wine 
that they shall be such head o head head head 

I do approve your judgement good Disanius 
but wish you not insult over man dejection 
we find that Stracocles be much penitent 
and trouble at his trespass 

a halter still he 
for a ambitious hypocritical traitor 

the time for my eudina match draw near 
and I no long will attend on fortune 
I have decree it past recall regardless 
whether against the oracle or with it 

yet be I confident in your assertion 
you priest of Delphos

on Stratocles if she stand long doubtful 
in a fair choice 

fear not my lord that doubt 
your country head will clear he have lose they 
for ever 

o brave head I will so ring 
their ear with jewel of praise and preferment 
that they shall glare like direful comet at he 

one she shall choose of they if not I will put 
a three upon she 

with your pardon sir 
why be you for I find it be so strong 
for Philocles 

no reason urge i 
and yet I find a inclination in i 
that plead for he I can perceive you too 
be partial towards Philargus can you yield 
a reason for it 

yes sir he be my elder 

Alas but not a hour well I will remit 
my power propound and accept 
her choice of either make within the time

certain of shipwreck yet the perilous wave 
my vessel ride on seem so many grave

and if there be aught that you hold more sacred 
move not to alter my fix resolution 

that resolution be i and I conjure you 
by the selfsame respect and all that be 
or may be hollow to let i depart 
I will remove but for some few day journey 
whence you shall due hear from i but rather 
I will travail to the antipode then here 
linger the vain impediment of your joy 
in your Eudina 

travel be my design 
Eudina must be you she be a bliss 
which heaven create for you 

can a bliss 
be purchase with your absence no it will torture 
equal in fruition as in want 
be it a kingdom only we can part it 
without the quarrel of the thebean brother 
or be it heaven itself Castor and Pollux 
shall have our imitation but Eudina 
be only indivisible 

add to it this 
their sentence be erroneous that deny 
partition to the soul for we do witness 
friendship can give she a division 
and make reciprocal community 
of all her faculty but still Eudyna 
be indivisible why name I she

therefore 
you both fly off to travel several way 
Come let i tell you your courtesy be foolish 
and you unworthy to have such a fortune 
hang like a pregnant cloud over your head 
ready to be dissolve in shower upon you 
while your own madness conjure up a wind 
to blow it away 

uncle you be unjust 
I will remove to let that golden shower 
light upon Philocles 

I upon Philargus 

I can even swaddle they both for a brace of baby 
your folly make i mad will you return 
yet to the presence both of you

to be both there be neither to be there 
but to breed more perplexity in Eudyna
