the unite blood of Spain and Portugal 
now meet in we the hereditary hope 
that be but in conception now have birth 
and what be but idea till this day 
have put on essence 

joy to the prince and princess 

this hail from you we count a blessing to we 
and more than common greeting as from gentleman 
crown both in blood and virtue 

these perhaps 
see with judicial eye unto these joy 
you gain by enjoy we 

we find they great 

but great we look for a superlative 
and if there be a fit and know degree 
above compare to have be mark with thou 
we will not have a thought conceive of we 
but shall be mix with rapture and what you 
term joy transport into ecstasy 
but great 

methinks addition great enough 
for any mortal woman 

to such goodness 
your highness may have lend a attribute 
of far more weight and splendour 

teach we that 

I shall who will be weigh unto my worth 
and yet in all my poise not lose a dram 
put you the proud lady in one scale 
and i into another 

you shall mount she if pride will do it 

this beauty virtue birth 
shall unto my own centre sink myself 
and lift she unto nought save smoke and air 

nay that upon my knowledge 

fair Isabel 
instruct i modest in what I err 
and if I shall but scant you in the least 
I will make you large amends 

why even in that 
in term i but fair fair Isabel 
it be a milkmaid title every swain 
bestow it on his mistress never so mean 
your city damsel scorn the word because 
it be common in the country and shall we 
breed in the court rich glory entertain 
what be great and fair we will be term divine 
such as will give we our full character 
must search for epithet and study phrase 

examine but plain Mantuan and he will tell you what woman be 

great prince of Portugal 
observe in i thy happiness thank not heaven 
so much that thou be bear nor bear a prince 
but that thou enjoy we for that great blessing 
give thy creation thanks 

so he well may 

behold I here expose i to all eye 
to universal censure live a lady 
great in blood if any that gainsay 
Spain shall maintain it by her potency 
search Italy and all these clime beyond 
come by the Alps back and view France throughout 
produce i the most excellent German froae 
examine England which some say breed beauty 
beyond all these and prince your Portugal 
to equal this this do I boast of those 
that be not i say we ascribe our birth 
only to fortune and to nature form 
count both these accidental there be a three 
virtue remain and even in that we dare 
with any princess of the world contest 
Come your free censure lord 

madam I hold you 
in least of these not to be parallel 

in my opinion madam you so far 
exceed all these that yet my eye have see 
nay hear or read of 

o base flattery 

that unto those beforetime wonder at 
you in our age appear a miracle 
and never to be match 

we observe in you 
a kind of enforce silence mix with scorn 
your tongue have be so backward to pronounce 
so definitive a sentence 

know then madam 
I must confess although a woman son 
yet can I dissemble neither will I 
shall I be rack and torture then with pardon 
unto the prince and you thus much I think 
I not deny but you by birth be royal 
beauteous or else I shall condemn my eye 
and say they wear false light for your know virtue 
traitor he be that shall but question they 
I make this attestation yet sweet Princess 
these praise you confer upon yourself 
though they be just and true from your own tongue 
loose part of their great luster in these or i 
they will have have more sweetness better sound 
but from a tuscan tongue or portugese 
english or french or any stranger mouth 
much more harmonious relish I have hold it 
still as a maxim my best judge day 
such doubt their worth be force themselves to praise 

who fit to speak truth then truth be own tongue 

yet arrogance in truth may blemish it 

of arrogance we 

call be if you please selflove 
beside in man or woman since the first 
nature have yield dead none so absolute 
to who she make no fellow first for beauty 
if Greece afford a fair Helen Troy 
she parallel with a Polyxena 
for wisdom Rome present a Cornelia 
and Lydia a Sosipatra chastity 
Lucrece of who the roman so much boast 
do not the self same city breed a Portia 
who when she hear her husband Brutus slay 
keep from all other engine swallow fire 
and by that mean to meet with he in death 
of such I can produce yet infinite 
and madam though I must confess you rare 
and most complete perfect in all these 
yet not so choice a piece but the wide world 
may yield you a competitor 

as you be prince 
and over hope to have the sweet fruition 
of those pure gift that man so much disdain 
grant i one free demand 

speak and obtain 

his banishment from Spain and Portugal 
never hereafter to be capable 
of honour of renown place or office 
till he can find produce and set before we 
our match in face and bosom birth we set by 
but be she woman and can balance we 
in both or either he redeem his exile 
without such to return forfeit his head 
deny this prince you banish we your bed 

most unpeered lady that not for ten world 
for if a husband can a vassal be 
to such approve virtue I be he 
lord Bonavida you have from her tongue 
a express doom that can be revoke 
it be like the persian seal unalterable 
and come my divine princess he shall know 
in his just doom what zeal to you we owe 

be this truth be merit can the court find place 
for none but flatterer and must I be make 
the first example of her tyranny 
shall I be make a precedent through Spain 
to deter man from speak in the court 
what be just and honest nay we term this law 
or mere oppression what a infinite task 
be I confine too one as virtuous 
no cloister scarce but can supply i with 
and never travel further but the doubt be 
whether it harbour in so smooth a skin 
as fair a face I may with ease produce 
but where be the virtue then since few there be 
that wear both these ascription chaste and fair 
in all his twelve great labour Hercules 
be not thus task by Juno 

ill news fly apace and have pluck i by the ear already well whosoever pronounce that sentence I hope nobody hear i I will his Portugal skin be tan into spanish leather and either cut into some slovenly boot to be dabble in the dirt without a galosh or snipe into a saint Martin jerkin that never come within the scent of a perfumer shop 

have she propose to find her match for pride 
there have be then no help no hope at all 
for that have be the hard task of two 

in stead of confine have his doom be to have be coffin there have be some comfort he may have still keep his country but in plain portugese and spanish both banish 

I be sure thou hear the news 

how can I choose be in the mouth of every Diego which I no soon hear but I so seek that I may find you and so find you never hereafter to lose you for without you this be no place for i and without i no country can be a country for you and so a fig for Spain and a prune for Portugal 

I both accept and will reward thy love

first these then several country we will try 
to find out this choice piece 

that be you and I

alas poor seacalf it be not his love I angle for I fish deep stream and for a rich draught have you not hear of Bonavida fortune 

to parallel the queen in beauty and virtue which he can never do 

which he may easy do her prerogative of birth set apart what blemish do you see in i that I may not be the woman 

thou foolish girl then compare a glowworm with a star a star with the sun 

and the sun with a burn glass come come you be dimsighted father can you see with my eye and judge with my understanding your comparison will hold Ã© contrario I assure you thy hasty news

I be my own nuntius and my errand love 

I hear no hurt my further honour still 

which I be come in person to deliver 
to this rare beauty 

honour upon honour 

my fortune fly of too strong a wing to stoop so low a pitch be not Bonavida come yet 

as much as ere he will I think Valladaura a pretty piece of flesh cease he play not Esop cur lose not the substance in expectation of the shadow it be a dog trick many lady have practise bosom he do 

what this mean creature 

and he be mean so thou get profit and thy father honour by it 

be all my hope repay with scorn 

he begin to recoil clap he close to thy breast he be go else 

nay Valladaura 

have I lay out more breath 
in sacrifice vow and fruitless sonnet 
unto that be beauteous shrine than ere man do 

Come be not passionate though I know both my worth and beauty and understand what orb they move into I be not so much infect with that same courtsickness philantia or selflove to scorn the service of any generous spirit 

how neither for thy profit nor thy father honour 

in sober conference then what bound service have you ever do my beauty that may challenge the least interest in my love 

as many as man can I write myself 
and true lover ere I can write man 
pass my service as a star where she 
the bless idea of thy glorious feature 
draw by the curious work of my thought 
give i the better I put out to sea 
and there 

what do you 

for thy honour now what do at sea 

as much as any man 

that do no more than thou do thy further honour still 

somewhat I do but what let these deep wound 
undress and unbind up deliver 

they be tonguetied and can speak for blush pretty ornament for a soldier how come you by they tro honest 

as noble Hector do by he but by 
a enemy far more valiant than he 

I like that well thy further honour still 

at sea I meet with a bold man of war 
and somewhat more a Englishman o have 
your eye but fate deny that blessedness 
witness our bear and how far the thought 
of you and your rare beauty carry i 
above my strength 

I shall have say what you be force to acknowledge that my beauty have be the better man 

I be proud of that my further honour still 

all this while you be behold to my beauty and I nothing in debt to your valour which for aught I gather be nothing at all 

nothing to enter and hold single combat 
with such a dare opposite nothing to take 
these dangerous wound and bring they home undress 

it be I confess somewhat to take these wound yet in my mind he that give the cognizance have more reason to boast of it than he that wear it show i the man that give you these wound and I will commend his valour 

for give of they knight there be small honour in take of they though in my judgement but what be he 

a man who noble valour I must speak 

good reason he have pay you sound for it afore hand 

in love and honour I shall ever serve he 

so I think for you wear a livery of he cut to the skin and line with crimson have you give it he I shall have cane you for the master but pardon i I soar too high for a servingman your ear I be modest away hie to the suburb bribe some honest barbersurgeon to wash off your dishonour and hear your infamy 
that do once learn this tenet of the war 
the honour more to give than wear a scar 
each coward may do that 

it be not my fate but my own imperfection 
that make the act in itself good and laudable 
ill and distasteful be my service 
do by some other they must needs become 
and grace the owner be my word deliver 
from any tongue but i they can not choose 
but win attention have my love be breed 
in any breast but i it can not thus 
be scorn and baffle i of all the world 
be most infortunate neither act word or love 
can please your audience or compassion move 

after our tedious travel we at length 
be safe arrive in England speak what use 
have make of our long voyage 

such as traveller use for by long practice I be now at length grow perfect and the truth be I can lie in any language 

but in our quest of this rare piece of beauty 
and virtue mix to rival the great princess 
what think thou of our trial make in Spain 

I think of it as I ever do that be as of a bottle of hay and the creature you talk of a needle a very spanish needle which I fear you will never live to hit full in the eye Spain there be so many moor in it that I know you will hope of nothing less beside the most beauty of Spain have be oft in civil 

what then of Portugal 

worse than the other the woman there be for the most part like their orange the fair the outside the rot within and the founder at the heart the rough the skin the country be too hot too hot 

what of the russian then 

as of a country too cold and in cold country I know we shall have but cold comfort beside the woman go wrap in so much fur that of necessity they must have more hair than wit beside they can be wise they have so much ado to keep themselves warm and more than that what may the prince and princess think if after all our long travel we shall come home and present they with a rush 

which only take her great title of 
be worth more than herself of Italy 
then give i thy true censure 

the clean contrary way o my lord there be so many italian lock that I know it be unpossible your own key shall open they all Moreover these that be natural jealous of their woman it be probable their woman natural give they cause 

for France 

what the pox shall we speak of that know what be breed in the bone will hardly out of the flesh 

the woman of high Germany 

a place that I shall high stand for if the princess have impose on we a challenge for drink 

of the Lowcountries then 

in Flushing there be good ride but not without danger for many at a high tide have be like to have be cast away in the road at Middleborough night or day you can scarce find the exchange empty at bristle if you remember you be use but rough at sluice we be both well wash Nimmingham bid you look to your sconce and Ostend beware the cat Donhague be full of witch and have we but touch at rot or dam ten to one we have never come off sound man much ado we have to find Newport therefore if ever you come to Bergen see you make it wise 

and now there be hope I shall this Albion 
that fit bear name of his chalky cliff 
breed wondrous choice of beauty wise and lovely 
scarce to be match in all the world beside 
among which I have take particular view of one 
who have the trojan ravisher behold 
Troy have still stand the queen of love disgrace 
and she alone have gain the golden prize 
for which the three celestial beauty strive 

I grant you the face but if she shall prove rot at the heart there be the question 

I think none to be make first for her birth 
I have inquire her noble for her breed 
it have be among her equal and so far 
from least taxation to the sail of tongue 
it merit imitation of her chastity 
some proof I have make and find it like the diamond 
save by a diamond never to be wrought 
can opportunity have move word tempt 
persuasion take effect or gift prevail 
beneath my much importance she have fall 
but like a promontory rock she stand 
at all the curl ocean wrath unmoved 
tell the gust and bear every storm 
yet on such virtue be her base fix 
she be not to be shake then in her 
my travel take their period 

then I will she and you be agree that you may come to a full point and here she come now or never make a full conclusion and write finis 

daughter 
what think you of this stranger 

as a stranger 

of his carriage and compliment 

as thing for which he have travel it be easy 
for he that have the liberty of many 
ground to pick himself a choice nosegay 
and he that have travel so many country 
out of every one peculiarise what be best 
with what small difficulty may such a one 
appear complemental 

his proffer to you be large 

and the performance may perhaps prove like 
his journey long 

what think you of his person 

that there be many one can pray so well as 
he that be better benefice 

but say he have power to perform all that he have promise 

only this that I have power in myself to say 
more than I have yet either promise he or 
you to utter 

do you not hear her talk of utter for shame sir either utter your mind now to the full or else utter give it over 

madam what say you to my suit 

I needs must say sir it become you well 
grace your person and your person it 
I like both stuff and fashion 

o sweet lady 
it be good to play with such as use to sport 
but with the stay be serious 

now while they be in talk will I hold some discourse or other with the old gentlewoman because she shall not interrupt they 
may it please your old ladyship 

out of this fellow I may find perhaps 
that which his master will have loath reveal 
I will join with he in conference 

since you tax i of jest I charge you sir 
henceforth to speak all earnest or stand mute 

I vow it by my great bliss on earth 
my hope I have in you 

I will try your faith 
have you in all the country you have travel 
never make proof of lady 

yes in all 
and in each clime of many 

nay I think what I shall find you trust a stranger love as gold to court the wind if then such number 
why after all these trial make you i 
the last of all your t'sales 

last of my hope 
or period of my wish have you say 
I shall have answer then only because 
of all you be most perfect 

now you flatter 

a lord say thou 

ay and I assure your ladyship ally to the best 
grandee of Spain nay more than so 

as I confess you perfect I entreat 
let not my merit praise make you proud 
and vie your own worth I shall wonder then 
know madam that I leave my country Spain 
and there my many honour not of pleasure 
but by compulsive force unwilling 
my voyage purposely to find out you 
which ere I can I have travel kingdom through 
search court examine city nay even village 

for i 

for you for the chief paragon 
of beauty match with virtue therefore you 
for one to rival the great spanish princess 
matchless in both through half the world save you 
indeed I flatter not you be that my 
o lady may I true say that i 
no India yield save this but thou the sun 
to outshine that candle none but this clear splendour 
dim her imperfect glory you by this 
shall win yourself a name through all the world 
and purchase admiration i that so 
have prise you and esteem you mark you 
among thousand for a piece unparalleled 
before all thing my country honour friend 
that else like a poor exile forfeit all 
and lady you the cause on it if my love 
ground upon such strong opinion 
merit repulse if you will lose yourself 
and hazard i that have my head engage 
to make this good I only shall report 
the strange thing in my long search I find 
beauty with virtue mix prove both unkind 

which shall I be pray give I leave to pause 
and then expect my answer 

And have he chuse she out among so many 

yes and mean to make she a great lady to possess she of all his fortune to put down all the prime lady of Spain and for beauty and virtue to be prefer before the great princess herself 

to this shall she not willing assent 
she be no more my daughter 

now your answer 

shall this be true that you prefer this face 
before the beauty of so many climb 
and that your life and mean sole depend 
there to expose it free I shall much 
digress from honour to neglect such love 
and shall I not in unseen virtue strive 
to equal that see beauty you so praise 
I shall then much wrong that great character 
you have bestow upon i 

which you shall not 
daughter I say you shall not sir she be you 
or I disclaim she ever 

pray good mother 
a little pardon i how shall I know 
what here you promise you can there make good 

if you distrust his word cake my which will pass in Spain for more maravedi than the best squire in England for farthingtoken 

that you may know it be not lust but love 
and the true speculation I have take 
in both these adjunct that proclaim you rare 
that it be to have you denison in Spain 
be instate in my liberal fortune there 
to appear in court a foreign miracle 
and not to make you here my prostitute 
I only beg your promise that be grant 
I will back into my country tell the princess 
what here in England I have see and find 
my peace be make I will return thus far 
to fix you in that sphere a splendent star 
and this be all I crave 

it be just and honest 
in this can be no fallacy at all 

as truth then I accept it and be you 

and lady I your creature for by you 
I be new make as mistress of this contract 
accept this ring which never part withal 
but to myself in person 

not in death 
it shall with i to my grave 

to prove your constancy 
one imposition more there may be train 
lay to entrap our love to injure you 
and forfeit i therefore till my return 
which shall be with what suddenness I can 
be show unto no stranger 

these I vow 
and pray you keep this token with that care 
that I shall your command on this presume 
of which through all Hesperia you may boast 
though my face please yet shall my virtue most 

thou have lose Isabel and I gain 
i a empire by my travel I by you 
be new create be lose and go 
with this most sweet addition two in one 

a good hear and I and the old gentlewoman be both witness to the bargain 

approve no act though never so well become 
part so well beautify phrase apt language 
to the very tone and accent of the time 
but seem in i defame and rustical 
none can endure my sight all thing I do 
be construe to the worst I walk the street 
salute I all I meet none resolute i 
but look askew and point and laugh at i 
as who shall say see Petrocella scorn 
and that which wound i deep than death can 
the more I strive to make i worth her love 
so much the more unworthy she repute i 

and faith what think of Bonavida undertake 

as of the man himself most frivolous and idle 
he parallel the queen ha ha ha 

they speak of i and seal it with a smile 
that I can sink and hide i in the centre 

bold Valladaura well return from sea we hear 

of my disgrace what a swift wing have rumor 

you meet a bold and noble opposite 

have you hear that too 

but beauteous Petrocella 

she have tell all I shall be ballast 
sing up and down by minstrel gentleman 
though my success fall short of my intent 
let it meet fair construction 

it deserve no less 

your noble bear have give our modern gallant 
plainsong to descant on

thy thought be a antidote against tyranny 

bear on that confidence lose not one tear 
nor spend a sigh let guilty coward fear 

you will find a change 

your churlish nor can we look to find 
usage more gentle revenge be unconfined 

and so shall i be what the art of man 
know of torment i shall inflict and can 
This part of you be the least and first 
of infinite to come 

I dare the worst 

most divine lady in the late exile 
of your depraver Bonavida how 
do you applaud my justice 

why as justice 
to have do less shall have disgrace I more 
than all your worth can merit 

who doubt that 
he be not worthy to be style a prince 
or to partake that goodness get in you 
that shall have let slip such proud arrogance 
without severe rigour 

troth I wonder 
in what remote clime the poor exile tread 
or in what place he hope to find that piece 
his impudence dare boast of 

he be perhaps 
travel to Arabia Felix and from thence 
to bring the phoenix hither 

he shall then 
have keep his country if a phoenix live 
you make Spain bless Arabia 

I remember 
there live a spanish princess of our name 
a Isabel too and not long since 
who from her palace window steadfast 
gaze upon the sun her heir take fire 
some augur hold it as a prodigy 
I rather think she be Latona brood 
and that Apollo court her bright hair 
else envy that her tress put down he 
he scorch they off in envy not dare I 
from she derive expose i to his beam 
lest as he burn the phoenix in her nest 
make of the sweet aromatic wood 
either in love or envy he agree 
to use the like combustion upon i 

a thing much to be fear 

then royal lady 
may I advise you keep out of the sun 
and walk still in the shade by proof we see 
such meteor oft take fire 

alas poor lord 
to see what thy bold rashness bring thou to 
that thou be force to wander through the world 
to find out a black swan to rival we 
thou seek a thing that be not and thy rashness 
have just force thy exile 

fair of creature 
I bring you news lord Bonavida be return 
and new arrive at court 

be sure it be so 

most certain royal princess 

to his death if he come empty hand 

but if speed 
than he redeem his exile 

blind and dull 
have plenty breed a surfeit in you then 
or have you take possession of that treasure 
you know not how to value to the worth 
but though you can we can rate ourself 
perhaps despair have bring he back to offer 
his desperate life which if with submission 
repentance and some due acknowledgement 
may in our grace find pardon go admit he 

now let we prepare our eye for he no question 
have bring over some rare creature 

take your stand let we have of her full view 

all the delight of earth and joy above 
for ever crown your temple 

Wellcome Bonavida

the labour in vain a fire on the sign and you too my donna turn to this my preferment to this a lady in the morning and a beggar before noon here be quick work indeed a cunning man a cunning rogue if ere it be my luck to see thou preach through a pillory as one of the cast limb of your curse crew do not long since the hangman shall have you by the ear for this but I will back and lay my case open to my lady 

your only curse and now aboard for Spain 
her shame be our honour and her loss our gain 

the Spaniard be noble beyond thought or expectation noble instead of a dungeon he have furnish i with mean and send i home with a letter of his purpose friendship to my friend and now though free both from Turk and Spaniard I live slave to a more cruel nation than both my own countryman for suretyship and debt disease that many a gallant lie sick to death on have take hold on i and though I know it improbable and partly ridiculous that a false beard and a fantastical habit shall mar my creation and make i a new creature it have pass currant with some in this place and I may the bold venture on it First then to my friend sister the young lady Ferrars I think her virtuous but withal know she for a woman and dare not trust my liberty in so weak a stomach in this disguise then I will address i to she present 

thou tell i wonder cheat of my ring by a cunning man and a crafty Spaniard the cozenage be premeditate a Spaniard be he 

some don or nobleman at least he wear very good clothes 

so may a cheat or a pickpurse the better body the plain the habit paint clothes be devise for ruine feeling and sluttish wall it be the apparel of the mind crown thou withn noble 

then be he a very beggar to cheat for so poor a trifle as a ring 

it be not so much for the value of the thing as to impoverish the oath of the wearer some crafty summoner have a hand in it or it may be Bonavida plot to try my loyalty and yet it relish too much baseness to come from so noble a author however shall I see this turn coward and like a fall tower bury my beauty in my own ruin no rather like the glorious sun dissolve and scatter these cloud of infamy it be resolve I will after they to Spain your purpose Rosara 

to give you my best attendance to the last minute please you ladyship accept it 

and free pardon thou receive a few direction for our voyage 

yes this disguise will do it and for my friend her noble brother sake I will make the first tender of my service to she save you lady 

you be welcome sir will you any thing with we 

impart a secret to you 

to a woman by no mean we want discretion to keep our own 

strange have I a secret concern my life I will trust it in a woman bosom to choose and think I say it up safe too 

your reason sir 

because no wiseman will over look for any matter of worth in such a weak build 

a fellow of a bold aspect and such a one be I assure of his carriage as will much avail i in my voyage be willing to serve 

Mine own turn with all my heart this fashion to my wish what if your ladyship do want a servant I be your man your first man too and such a man as know the world 

and such a man do I want 
you have be in Spain then 
do hear no talk of a Englishman there 
one Farrers 

and one Manhurst his friend they be both prisoner and lie only for ransom 

my brother prisoner this news wing i for my voyage 

be you for any adventure lady 

thy bad news enforce i I will make that my colour at least that gentleman be my brother and cost it the last penny of my dower I will not see he want I will furnish our voyage instant 

as generous as he be valiant it be cowardice in i to dishearten she we must be gallant what habit be I best to travel in let i see a Spanish slop good easy wear but that like chambermaid they be loose and somewhat too open below 

methinks your dutch cassock be a comely wear 

it have be but now adays it grow short and short like your court allowance their tailor be good husband though they make little or no waste at all and that make your gallant stand so much upon point your buttonhose be a good wear for courtier 

why for courtier 

cause they be full of large promise outward but line with narrow and scantperformance within 

it have be a good fashion but it be old 

So be all goodness else we have nothing new but oath and disease 

no for my money give i your substantial english hose round and somewhat full afore 

now they be methinks a little too great 

the more the discretion of the landlord that build they the make room enough for his tenant to stand upright in he may walk in and out at ease without stoop but of all the rest I be clean out of love with your irish trouse they be for all the world like a jealous wife always close at a man tail out of all these will I cut and fashion that shall be and imitable will you follow 

Even where fate lead i we be all her slave 
and have no dwelling of our own 

yes grave 

I never hear a fellow since my year teach i how to distinguish ill from good to talk in this strange key how english this what be thou in thy country

I perceive 
your come be to make i think you noble 
will you persuade i deem your friend a god 
for only such make man be you a gentleman

captive to fortune and a slave to want 
I can not call these clothes I wear my own 
I do not eat but at another cost 
this air I breathe be borrow never be man 
so poor and abject I have not so much 
in all this universe as a thing to leave 
or a country I can free boast be i 
in all the world I have but one true friend 
and he be ravish from i 
my essence and my be be another 
what shall I say I be not any thing 
and I possess as little 

tell i that 
Come come I know you to be no such man 
you be a soldier valiant and renown 
your carriage try by land and prove at sea 
of which I have hear such full expression 
no contradiction can persuade you less 
and in this faith I be constant 

a mere worm 
tread on by every fate 

raise by your merit 
to be a common argument through Spain 
and speech at prince table for your worth 
your presence when you please to expose it abroad 
attract all eye and draw they after you 
and these that understand you call their friend 
and point through the street say this be he 
this that brave and noble Englishman 
who soldier strive to make their precedent 
and other man their wonder 

this your scorn 
make i appear more abject to myself 
then all disease I have taste yet 
have power to asperse upon i and yet lady 
I can say something dare I 

speak it at once 

and yet 

nay but we will admit no pause 

I know not how my phrase may relish you 
and loath I be to offend even in what be past 
I must confess I be too bold farewell 
I shall no more distaste you 

sir you do not 
I do proclaim it you do not stay I charge you 
or as you say you have be fortune scorn 
so ever prove to woman

and yet now I bethink i 

as you be a soldier 
and Englishman have hope to be redeem 
from this your scorn bondage you sustain 
have comfort in your mother and fair sister 
renown so blaze in the ear of Spain 
hope to rebreathe that air you taste first 
so tell i 

what 

your apprehension catch 
and almost be in sheaf 

lady I shall 

and in a word 

I will 

pronounce it then 

I love you 

ha ha ha 

still it be my misery 
thus to be mock in all thing 

pretty faith 

I look thus to be laugh at my estate 
and fortune I confess deserve no less 
that make i so unwilling to denounce 
my own derision but alas I find 
no nation sex complexion birth degree 
but jest at want and mock at misery 

love i 

I do I do and maugre fate 
and spite of all sinister evil shall 
and now I charge you by that filial zeal 
you owe your father by the memory 
of your dear mother by the joy you hope 
in bless marriage by the fortunate issue 
store in your womb by these and all thing else 
that you can style with goodness instant 
without evasion trick or circumstance 
nay lest premeditation answer i 
affect you i or no 

How speak you that 

without demur or pause

to sleep upon it

as if my answer please not

for my own tongue must kill i noble lady 
you have endear i to you but my vow 
be never to match with any of what state 
or birth soever till before the contract 
some one thing I impose she

or if she fail i in my first demand 
I to abjure she ever 

I be she 
that beg to be imply so name a danger 
who very face will fright all womanhood 
and manhood put in trance nay who aspect 
will ague such as shall but hear it tell

and turn they into marble these and more 
shall you but speak it I will do 

and swear to this

unkind man thou have kill i 

and my self with the same stroke 

o noble Englishman

but in this 
pray sir can you be serious 

as I will in death unto my confessor 

then I be lose 
now base than this fellow term himself 
to he that be on earth most miserable 
I be now become a vassal nay despise

for face and virtue to the peerless queen 
both these have prostitute to a slave 
to be more slave than he but shall he thus 
behold in i this passion to usurp 
triumph in my disgrace and boast abroad 
of this so poor a conquest no Petrocella recollect thyself

and where thy heart be sick complain thy heel 
let not thy see grief please he 

Home and retire why shall you strive thus 
to undo one that be already conquer

there can be aught good in thou save this 
which be the last that thou have plight i 
to one more worthy one who very shadow 
I prize above thy be one who action

to ransom such a what thou know thyself 
he I will both love and marry hence depart 
o heaven how far my tongue speak from my heart
