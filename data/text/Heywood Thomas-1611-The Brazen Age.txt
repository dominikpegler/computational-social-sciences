the like I wish 

we have find you brother royal 
and subject loyal 

they be of our line 
of which no branch do ever perish yet 
by canker blast or dry barrenness 
but Meleager let i turn to thou 
who birth the fate themselves do calculate 

pray mother how be that I have hear you say 
somewhat about my birth miraculous 
but never yet know the true circumstance 

it be thus the very instant thou be bear 
the sister that draw spin and clip our life 
enter my chamber with a fatal brand 
which hurl in the fire thus say one day one date 
betide this brand and child even be their fate 
So part they the brand begin to burn 
and as it waste so do thou consume 
which I perceive leap unto the flame 
and quench that stay thy consumption 
the brand I as a jewel have reserve 
and keep it in a casket lock as safe 
as in thy bosom thou maintain thy heart 

pray keep it well for if not with my mother 
with who dare Meleager trust his life 
but sister Deianeira now to you 
two worthy champion must this day contend 
and try their eminence in arm for you 
great Achelous and strong Hercules

and the nymph Nais bear on Pindus mount 
from whence our broad and spacious current rise 
so be we proud to cope with Hercules 
never let my stream wash Acarnania bank 
or we confine in thous our grand seat 
till by the ruin of Alcmena son 
we lodge bright Deianeira in our arm

And deck our shoulder in their honour spoil 
the Caledonian boar crush with our club 
the rude thessalian centaur sink beneath 
our juiall hand pierce hell bind Cerberus 
And buffet so long till from the foam 
the dog belch forth strong aconitum spring 
and shall a petty river make our way 
to Deianeira bed impassable

I will make thou run thy head below thy bank 
make red thy water with thy vital blood 
and spill thy wave in drop as small as tear 
if thou presume to cope with Hercules 

what be Hercules that I shall dread his name 
or what be he great than Amphitrio son 
when we assume the name of demigod 
not Proteus can transshape himself like we 
for we command our figure when we please 
sometime we like a serpent run along 
our meadowy bank and sometime like a bull 
graze on these strand we water with our stream 
we can translate our fury to a fire 
and when we swell in our fierce torrent swallow 
the champion plain and flow above the hill 
drown all the continent by which we run 
yea Hercules himself 

i Achelous 
I can do more than this love Deianeira 
swim with she on my shoulder through thy stream 
and with my huge club beat thy torrent back 
with thy own water quench the infernal fire 
thy figure serpentine flat on the earth 
and when thou be bull catch fast hold by thy horn 
and whirl thou about my head thus into air 
thou fair aetolian dame I can woo 
nor paint my passion in smooth oratory 
but fight for thou I can against Achelous 
or all the horrid monster of the earth 

when begin your proud and hostile enmity

thy terror fright not i serpent or devil I will pash thou 

fright we with fire our club shall quench thy flame 
and beat it down to hell from whence it come 

what yet more monster serpent bull and fire 
shall all alike taste great Alcides ire

I see no magic or enchant spell 
have power on virtue and true fortitude 
no sleight illusion can deceive the eye 
of he that be divine resolute

which tear from my head in shape of bull 
thus wound i take Deianeira free

which all the nymph and grace dwell near 
shall fill with redolent flower and delicate fruit 
and call it cornucopia plenty horn

of torture not the infernal with more pang 
can plague the villain than Alcides shall

shall be a pastime the three snakehaired sister 
that lash offender with their whip of steel 
shall seem to dally when with every string 
they cut the flesh like razor but the dead 
we hate to touch as cowardly and base 
and vengeance not become Hercules 
Come Deyaneria first to consummate 
our high espousal in triumphant Thebes 
that do our future labour we will pursue 
and by the assistance of the power divine 
strive to act more than Juno can assign 

in Egypt there of long time fall no rain 
for which unto the oracle they send 
answer return that till one stranger slay 
immoved shall be the marble firmament 
therefore the tyrant all these stranger kill 
that enter Egypt till Alcides come 
and with the tyrant bulk the altar fill 
at who red slaughter fall a plenteous rain 
for he that stranger and usurper be 
who bloody fate the oracle forspeak 
but for a while we let Alcides pass 
who these of Egypt will their sovereign make 
for free they from such a tyrant rage

bury the greek but must they all survive 
to threat we with invasion speak Anchises 
march they towards Troy 

in conduct of the mighty Hercules 
waste with sword and fire where ere they march 
Scamander field they have strew with carcase 
and Simois stream already purple be 
with blood of trojan 

let we give they battle 

in vain our force be disperse abroad 
nor have we order to withstand their fury 
best be we to immure ourselves in Troy 
and trust unto the virtue of our wall

their cry and lofty clamour threaten Troy 
they dog we to our gate and without speed 
and expedition they will enter with we 
come then our threaten life we will immure 
and think we in our strong build wall secure 

pursue the chase even to the gate of Troy 
then call the ingrate Laomedon to parley 

the perjure king shall pay we for the wrong 
do to Alcides in his promise steed 

better he have the monster have devour 
his beauteous daughter then to abide our fury

and now therefore he shall admit our fury 

these wall first rear at the great god expense 
we will ruin to the earth let we summon he 

we will call he to parley

to parley but to warn thou guard thy wall 
which without pause we now intend to scale 

will hear i Hercules 

I listen thy perjurious tongue too late 
scale batter mount assault sack and deface 
and leave of Troy nought save the name and place 

thus be the tyrant that but late awe Troy 
bury amid his ruin he chastise 
and we revenge the spoil of this rich town

you shall divide but first these lofty wall 
build by perjury and maintain by pride 
we will ruin to the earth who see young Priam 

he be flee and take the way to Samothrace 
with he Anchises that on Venus get 
the young Aeneas they be flee together 
and leave the spoil of all the town to we 

which shall enrich Thebes and the town of Greece 
and Telamonius to do thy valour right 
for mount first over the wall of Troy 
the first and choice of all the spoil be thou 

then let Alcides honour Telamonius 
with this bright lady fair Hesione 
sister to Priam daughter to Laomedon 
who beauty I prefer before the state 
and wealth of Troy 

receive she Telamonius 
she be thy own by gift of Hercules 

a present more delight Telamonius 
then be I make lord of high Ilium tower 
and heir unto the dead Laomedon 

I be a princess shall my father ill 
fall on my head if he offend Hercules 
he have make satisfaction with his life 
o be not so severe to stretch his punishment 
even after life have thou from death redeem i 
to give i captive and to slave my youth 
thing worse than death rather let Hercules 
expose i to the rock where first he find i 
to abide the wrath both of the sea and sun 
oh rather make my body food for monster 
then brand my birth with bondage 

fair Hesione 
I will not lose thy beauty nor thy youth 
nor part with this my honour can thou give i 
for ransom of they both our Argo cram 
with gold and gem you be my valour prize 
and shall with i to populous Salamine

to give she as a duke base concubine 
touch i not Telamonius for I divine 
I fear my brother Priam rebuild Troy 
and be the king of Asia he will revenge 
this base dishonour do Hesione 
and for his sister ravish hence perforce 
do the like outrage on some grecian queen 
in just revenge of my injurious wrong 

shall all the king in Asia or the world 
take part with Priam in that proud design 
like fate like fortune with Laomedon 
they shall abide renown Telamonius 
she be the warlike purchase of thy sword 
enjoy she as the gift of Hercules 
and now brave grecian Hero be let we towards Greece 
with all these honour spoil from Colchos bring 
and from the treasure of deface Troy 
fair Deianeira long for we in Thebes 
who we will visit next and thence proceed 
unto our future labour Cacus live 
a bloody tyrant who we must remove 
and the threeheaded Geryon sway in Spain 
notorious for his rape and outrage 
both these must perish by Alcides hand 
and when we can the earth from tyrant clear 
in the world utmost bound our pillar rear exit 

loath be we courteous auditor to cloy 
your appetite with viand of one taste 
the beauteous Venus we must next employ 
who we see mourning for Adonis last 
suppose she still for the young Adonis sad 
but cheer by Mars their old love they renew 
and she that while he live prefer the lad 
have quite forget he since the boar he slay 
Mars be in grace a meeting they devise 
jealous of all but fear most the sun 
he that see all thing from his first uprise 
and like a blab tell all that he know do 
our mortal must a while their spleen assuage 
and to the god for this act leave the stage 

I know love queen can not be long unkind 
though while I absent to teach arm in Thrace 
you take the advantage to forget your Mars 
to dote on Adonis and Anchises too 
yet those wear out let we renew our love 
and practise our first amorous dalliance 

how can I hate that be the queen of love 
or practise aught against my native power 
as I one day play with my Cupid shaft 
the wanton with his arrow raze my skin 
trust i at first I do neglect the smart 
at length it rankle and it grow unsound 
till he that now lie wound cure my wound 

Come shall we now while Vulcan ply his forge 
sweat at his anvil choke himself with dust 
and labour at his bellows kiss and toy

yet aloof 
let we observe he and great jove implore 
to qualify his pain 

as I be Philoctetes I will not leave he 
until he be immortal prince hark 
can these groan pierce heaven and move to pity

have bring on he this sad and ominous fate 
nor hence for any force or prayer remove 
but die with he who I so dear love 

his torment still increase hear o you god 
and hear pity 

down down you shadow that crown Oeta mount 
and as you tumble bear the rock along 
I will not leave a oak or stand pine 
but all these mountain with the dale make even 
that Oeta self may mourn with Hercules 
hah what be thou

and make i boil in poison for which minion 
and for by fate thou have shorten my renown 
behold this monstrous rock thy death shall crown 
so Deianeira and her squire be now 
both in their sin extinct 

what have Alcides do slay Omphale 
a guiltless queen that come to mourn his death 

torment on torment but shall Hercules 
die by a woman hand no aid i prince 
if you have in you any generous thought 
in my last fabric come toss tree on tree 
till you have rear i up a funeral pile 
which all that be mortal in i shall consume 

prince let none deny their free assistance 
in his release of torture there be for i 

my hand shall likewise help to bury he 
and of his torment give he ease by death 

thank thus I throne i in the midst of fire 
and with a dreadless brow confront my death 
olympic thunderer now behold thy son 
of who divine part make a star that Atlas 
may shrink beneath the weight of Hercules 
and stepdame Iuno glut thy hatred now 
that have be weary to command when we 
have not be weary to perform and act 
I that Busiris slay Antheus strangle 
and conquer still at thy unkind behest 
the threeshaped Geryon and the dog of hell 
the bull of Candy and the golden heart 
Augeus and the fowl of Stymphaly 
the hesperian fruit and bolt of Thermidon 
the lernaean Hydra and arcadian boar 
the lion of Nemea steed of Thrace 
the monster Cacus thousand more than these 
that Hercules in death dare thou to chide 
and show his spirit which torment can hide 
lie there thou dread of tyrant and thou skin 
invulnered still burn with thy master bone 
for these be arm which none but we can wield 
my bow and arrow Philoctetes take 
reserve they as a token of our love 
for these include the utmost fate of Troy 
which without these the greek can never destroy 
you hero all farewell heap fire on fire 
and pile on pile till you have make a structure 
to flame as high as heaven and record this 
though by the god and fate we be overthrow 
Alcides die by no hand but his own 

Juno thou have do thy worst he now defy 
what thou can more his fame shall mount the sky 
what heavenly music be this 

his soul be make a star and mount heaven 
I see great jove have not forget his son 
all that his mother be be change by fire 
but what he take of jove and be divine 
now a bright star in the high heaven must shine 

we all have see Alcides deify 
but what news bring Atreus 

a true report of Deianeira death 
who when she hear the torture of her lord 
and what effect her fatal present take 
exclaim on Nessus and to prove herself 
guiltless of treason in her husband death 
with her own hand she bold slay herself 

that noble act proclaim her innocent 
and clear all black suspicion but fair prince 
let universal Greece in funeral black 
mourn for the death of theban Hercules 

who now shall monster quel or tyrant tame 
the oppres free or fill Greece with their fame 
prince your hand take up these monument 
of his twelve labour in a marble temple 
we will erect and dedicate to he 
reserve they to his last memory 
his brazen pillar shall be fix in Gades 
on which his monumental deed we will grave 
arm with these worthy trophy let we march on 
towards Thebes that claim the honour of his birth 
his body be dead his fame shall never expire 
earth claim his earth heaven show his heavenly fire 

he that expect five short act can contain 
each circumstance of these thing we present 
methinks shall show more barrenness than rain 
all we have do we aim at your content 
strive to illustrate thing not know to all 
in which the learn can only censure right 
the rest we crave who we unlettered call 
rather to attend then judge for more than sight 
we seek to please the understand ear 
which we have hitherto most gracious find 
your general love we rather hope than fear 
for that of all our labour be the ground 
if from your love in any point we stray 
think Homer blind and blind man miss their way
