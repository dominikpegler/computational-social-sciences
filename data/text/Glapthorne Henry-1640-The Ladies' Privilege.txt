encompass mutual their gawdy neck 

you will infer that we 
shall in their imitation spend this time 
intend for a conference which concern we 
near than compliment 

why my Chrisea 
we may entwine as free since our love 
be not at age yet to conceive a sin

a lawless passion for my service

my fame shall scandal touch it you will fight 
perhaps to show your valour but I have 
a task to enjoin i which my fear possess i 
you dare not venture to accept 

by truth 
you wrong my faith and courage to suspect i 
of so extreme a cowardice have I stand the heat 
of battle till upon the mountainous pile 
of slaughter carcase the soul which leave they 
seem to ascend to heaven that your suspicion 
shall taint my honour with this base revolt 
this be not noble in you 

do not rage 
when you shall hear it you will then confess 
your confident error 

my loyalty will not 
permit that strong rebellion in my breast 
to doubt the mean falsehood in a word 
her voice can utter which shall charm the world 
to a belief some cherubin have leave 
its room in heaven to carol to the earth 
celestial anthem and I now begin 
to question my own frailty but by all 
which we call good or holy be it your will 
I shall invade inevitable death 
in its most ugly horror my obedience 
shall like a careless pilot cast this bark 
on that pale rock of ruin 

will you swear this

a form of oath so bind that no law 
or power can dispense with and I will seal 
with my best blood pray madam tell i what

shall violate I will not

you will find i very serious nay more 
I love another and I do enjoin you 
since it be a man you may overrule to assist i 
in my obtain he without who love 
I be resolute to perish 

sure I dream 
or some strange sudden death have change his frame 
to immortality for be I flesh 
and shall hear this certain my violent rage 
will pull i to some desperate act beyond 
the reach of fury these be word will infect 
rosecoloured patience clear and lovely front 
with loathsome leprosy change flame to tear 
and with unusual harshness of the sound 
deafen the genius of the world 

where be now 
the strength of soul you boast do the noise 
of the death speak cannon not affright 
your settle resolution and the voice 
of a weak woman shake your youthful blood 
into a ague since you so ill bear this 
when you shall hear the man who love have steal 
your interest you will rage more than unlimited fire 
in populous city 

sure it be she who speak 
I do enjoy yet sound untainted sense 
each faculty do with a peaceful harmony retain 
its proper organ yet she do rehearse 
she must no long love i o that word transform 
the soul of quiet into rage 
above distract madness madam tell i 
what place be this for you have lead i 
into a subtle labyrinth where I never 
shall have fruition of my former freedom

with his own nail his grave must live confine 
to the sad maze for ever

by most submissive and continue prayer 
reclaim my affection which stand fix as fate 
upon your friend Vitelli

to jest my life away Vitelli be 
the person to obtain who precious love 
I do conjure you by all tie of honour 
to employ your utmost diligence

so tame of the sudden have the feeble spirit 
of some degenerate coward fright hence 
my resolution which have give a law 
to fate itself that I must now become 
the stale to my own ruin o Chrisea 
who be so good that virtue will have sigh 
at the unwelcome spectacle have you 
appear but woman in a passion 
though of the slight consequence o do not 
abjure that saintlike temper it will be 
a change hereafter burdenous to your soul 
a sin to one who all his lifetime bless 
with peace of conscience at his die minute 
fall into mortal enmity with heaven 
and perish eternal 

my will guide my determination and you must 
in honour act your promise

thing precious to i and one cruel word 
rob i of both my friend and she Chrisea

nor tear to beg your pity

because they shine on you as recall my vow 
which I will urge no further but wish you 
regard your honour but farewell I must 
be cruel ever to my own love unjust

attract to heaven as to create a star 
and throw it a fade meteor to the earth

for perfect sorrow but as a bubble brook 
that sport and curl within its flowery bank 
till the vast sea devour it only fall 
into the abyss of mischief passion surround 
my intellectual power only my heart 
like to a rocky island do advance 
above the foe my violence of the flood

who sail against danger both of wind and tide

a nature

myself to imitation of what honour

only the air of Genoa and never taste 
foreign behaviour covet nothing more 
than certain knowledge of it as it be proper to

in novelty your Spaniard as you say 
be of a stay serious and haughty garb 
act all his word with shrug and gesture kiss 
his hand away in kindness be of diet 
spare will pick his tooth as formal 
after a orange or a clove of garlic 
which be his ordinary morsel as he will feed 
on partridge or pheasant 

it be his grace 
after his dinner sir and to confirm 
their most officious gravity a castilian 
be for some crime in Paris to be whip 
in triumph through the street and be admonish 
to be more swift of foot so a void

a title of his gravity

Corimba what answer from Vitelli do I live 
or in the kill rigour of his scorn 
must I die wretched 

sincere madam 
you be too timorous of your own desert 
or else you dare not doubt that he or any 
you be so neat yourself and dress as neat 
as any lady in the court shall hazard 
the reputation of his wit by slight 
such a accomplish beauty 

you talk 
and play the cunning flatterer to excuse 
your negligence but know affection fire 
once kindle by desire and blow by thought 
into a heat expire a thousand sigh 
which as love smoke like incense fly to heaven 
while the light fire with nimble wing do soar 
to its own sphere true lover heart who cherish 
the flame till they to ash burn and perish 

why ladybird be you so passionate the gentleman 
be a kind gentleman have all that may 
set forth a man for when I tell he how 
like a hurt deer you wound be with love 
life how he leap for joy as if the self 
same arrow which strike you have glance on he 
and as a token of his love he send you 
a bleed heart in a cornelion which 
beshrew i most unfortunate I lose 

Cornuba see 
if general Doria be within Eurione 
I have be seek thou how do thou sister 
I must demand a question that concern 
the safety of your fame 

I rest 
secure in my own innocence and no malice 
can forge a accusation which can blemish 
my mean thought with scandal 

I believe but know Eurione I be inform 
you do affect Vitelli and conjure you 
by the dear memory of our mother tell i 
if the report be certain 

shall I deny it 
my love will muster thousand blush up 
to invade my guilty cheek I must confess 
I love he so as modesty and truth 
afford i warrant 

it be ill do and childish so easy to impart 
the treasure of your liberty to keep 
of a neglect stranger 

his own worth 
deserve as noble knowledge here as many 
who borrow titular glory from the dust 
of their forget ancestor 

you defend he 
like a brave championess as if you mean 
to engage your dear pawn of life and honour 
in his protection 

say I do the even 
though most strict justice will allow as lawful 
my honourable purpose 

fie you be lead on too wild by your fancy sister 
it ill befit the greatness of your blood 
to seek to mix its pure stream with a poor 
regardless river 

he appear to i 
broad in his own dimension as the sea 
clear as a brook who crystal lip salute 
only the fresh meadow such a creature 
that be some cunning painter to express 
a angel clothe in humane shape he may 
from his derive a pattern 

but suppose my fancy 
shall oversway my judgement to affect 
Vitelli sure your manner will allow i 
by willing resignation of your choice 
the privilege of my birthright 

will you urge 
a claim so just i because you view 
the light two year before i no Chrisea 
Love a unlimited passion that admit 
no ceremonious difference this prerogative 
shall queen endeavour their unvalued dowry 
be not of worth to purchase and though here 
as it befit i I observe the distance 
due to your birth yet in love sacred court 
my place be high as you and there we may 
walk hand in hand together 

do not flatter 
your fancy with this vain conceit Vitelli 
must be no more you know I have enjoin 
the general Doria to engage his friend 
to embrace my proffer love to he 

you strive 
because you think my young and timorous flame 
unapt to encounter brave vitellis heat 
as cunning nurse do with froward babe 
fright they into a appetite but say 
all this be real think you Doria will 
so easy be persuade to renounce 
his proper interest and enthral his friend 
to a unwilling slavery 

by truth he have impawn his honour to endeavour 
what I have utter gentle girl consider 
love unresisted violence and believe 
I will not have a rival to usurp 
a corner in the kingdom of that heart 
of which I be sovereign so farewell dear soul 
consider out 

Consider out why this be such a act 
do by a cruel sister as shall taint 
that holy name with such a black reproach 
that shall a thousand pious virgin weep 
river of tear their most immaculate drop 
will not wash white her scandal hapless girl 
that in love tempest be but late toss 
and now recover in a calm art lose 

madam the duke entreat your instant company 

I shall attend his pleasure good Lactantio 
if you can meet my cousin Bonivet 
desire he visit i

my friend Vitelli here this be his hour 
I wonder he be tardy 

your lordship prevent the time with speed or else Vitelli 
have some impediment by business sir 
you be opportune welcome to deliver 
your own excuse I be about to stretch 
my invention for you 

noble friend your enemy have you engage your faith 
to any personal meeting can expect you 
but at the minute reason may dispense 
betwixt we with such a nicety 

now your friend 
arrive I must beg licence to depart 
I have some urgent business 

good Lactantio your time be your own 

I kiss your lordship hand 

friend now we be alone I safe may 
speak my conjecture I have read your look 
and in their pensive character find secret 
strange sign of sadness 

I be sad indeed 
when my remembrance tell i I have only 
verbal assurance of your friendship 

try i by any attempt who danger do surpass 
the common path of dare be it to snatch 
a fiery build when it from heaven come wrap 
in sheet of lightning to afford true proof 
of my affection and with eager haste 
such as inspire a husband to enjoy 
his spouses virgin purity I will run 
to the achievement 

these be but protest such as be get by ceremony proceed 
not from intensive zeal yet I will experience 
the truth of your affection by a trial 
of such a noble and effective weight 
which if you brave do support you will stand 
as some tall pyramid or column for 
your own memorial to tell aftertime 
the power and strength of friendship 

pray name it and it be a burden will overpress the earth 
I will be the able Atlas to sustain 
heaven on my willing shoulder 

there be a lady in who each eye sit fire and on her cheek 
victorious beauty captive to her smile 
dance in lovely triumph one who emblem 
the glory of mortality in each look 
contract the orb of lustre to a glance 
brandish beam who purity dispense 
light more immaculate than the gorgeous east 
wear when the prostrate indian do adore 
its rise brightness yet this wonder dote 
on you with such inevitable fervour 
that I in pity of her suffering come 
to entreat you love she 

who my lord 

you can appear so strange stupid not to acknowledge 
creation miracle when I point out 
her very figure you as well may seem 
when the bleak north do with congeal blast 
bind up the crizzle stream in chain of ice 
not to know winter ignorant of she 
who have she live when superstitious mist 
shade the world more grove of gamme have fame 
to her divine beauty then to all 
the race of idle deity it be Chrisea 
the fair Chrisea love you 

the fair Chrisea your lordship be merry

what I deliver with that unfeigned zeal 
that penitent do their prayer I say Chrisea 
a name who every accent sweet sound 
than quire of siren sense bereave note 
Chrisea love you infinite above 
expressive term the orator shall strive 
to paint her masculine fancy and I be bind 
to pay this homage to her best content 
as to conjure you by all sacred tie 
of honour amity and what else may serve 
to enforce the endearment with your noble love 
to gratify her fancy 

no persuasion 
can make i think this serious good my lord 
do not you love Chrisea 

more than a babe do the kind nurse that feed it with her blood 
more than I do my quiet or the joy 
of aught but bless eternity Vitelli 
no other argument can more convince 
suspicion shall it doubt my love but this 
that to procure her peace I have confine 
the greatness of my passion and give up 
to thy dispose a jewel which the earth 
and sea shall both unlade their hide wealth 
shall not have purchase from i 

these be art to puzzle my conceit my lord 
I be no such puny in the craft of love 
that I want brain to find this drift which be 
as obvious to i as your eye now you 
be home return victorious big with praise 
lade with title that sit heavy on you 
then your steel corslet in hot fight coniemne 
affinity with i to who you have hear 
the fair Eurione have resign her heart 
and by this circumvention shall I court 
at your entreat her sister may pretend 
a righteous cause for a unjust revolt 
for be it otherwise your temper can not 
brook your chrisea change without a start 
into a sudden fury 

this language I understand not by my honour friend 
this iteration may disperse your doubt 
I do again conjure you by all right

Chrisea noble shall I have your answer

the privilege of my liberty this body 
I do confess your captive and it have suffer 
a honourable thraldom but my mind 
remain unbounded as the air or fire 
be from their sphere Eurione have win 
by the subdue valour of her look 
that in a field of fancy not of blood 
and ere another shall usurp her right 
in the defence I will die her willing martyr 

I judge what serious value 
your boast friendship will retain in the test 
draw your bright weapon know that I do hate 
baseness as much as cowardice and since 
you slight a lady for who priceless love 
king may resign their crown and humble fall 
like bare foot pilgrim prostrate at the shrine 
of such a beauty sure if in this sword 
death have a residence your life shall find it 
and not survive to boast the cruel triumph of her refusal 

sir your sword can excite a tremble in my blood 
the glister splendour cherish my sight 
like polish crystal henceforth name of friend 
be no more know betwixt we then a dream 
thus I expire it I may now regain 
my honour forfeit in the general cause 
by this particular combat 

shall my fate yield i the conquest yet his death will not 
beget Chrisea quiet but augment 
her grief and hate against i stay forbear 
I feel a palsy in my vein and can 
manage this little instrument of death 
my sinew put on infancy again 
and have no vigour in they o Vitelli 
I be so full of passion I have scarce 
room leave to vent a sigh a i of lead 
hang on my heart and with its weight have crack 
the feeble courage 

noble soul his grief 
work more compunction in i than his sword 
do sudden anger can I grant what you 
request no brandmarked slave shall fulfil 
soon his master most severe command 
than I will you but this abrogate all law 
of friendship duty if you have vow this act 
you may as safe disannul the oath 
as shall you in some desperate fury swear 
to be your father murderer 

bid i first renounce 
my allegiance to my honour sell my faith 
I owe my native country my Vitelli 
I feel a humour in my brain which strive 
for passage at my eye will see i weep 
Consider friend deny my request 
thou do undo a lady who may claim 
the privilege of all heart deprive the world 
of such a gem that shall old nature strive 
to frame her second it will quite exhaust 
her glorious treasury then in her ruin 
my life and honour be forfeit think this 
and be thy heart obdurate as a rock 
of adamant this thought join with my tear 
will soon than the blood of goat dissolve it 
to gentle softness 

your eye be move advocate they speak 
such a overflow language that my love 
then in its own cause a most partial judge 
allow my mercy freedom to pronounce 
sentence on your side you have prevail 
I will serve Chrisea as her pleasure shall 
dispose my will and fortune 

I begin to feel my spirit quicken and my blood 
receive its noble temper dear Vitelli 
thy nobleness do prompt thou to a act 
shall write thy friendship high in the list 
of sacred amity than mother love 
go to my best Chrisea she expect 
to know by thou the truth of my success 
tell she I be more happy in her bliss 
than if I have enjoy her constant love 
so leave i love I may perhaps transgress 
manhood again and shall thou see i weep 
twice thou will judge my former flood of tear 
a feign passion

balm to his wound while I do bleed die 

noble general I come to gratulate the happy choice 
you have make in fair Chrisea she be a lady 
that though she be a stranger to my blood 
my judgement will allow as rich a virtue 
as ever glorify the sex 

it will be a sacrilegious error not to admit 
your character for truth but in our love 
a thousand hide cause do produce 
alternate change my return have settle 
my thought on new resolve and I must suit 
my affection to they 

how perhaps because 
you be return triumphant with your bay 
grow upon your brow you do reject 
the love before you sue for it be not noble 
so to abase a lady who bright fame 
although untainted as a crystal rock 
must pass a popular censure if you who 
do with such earnestness pretend her match 
shall on the sudden scorn it 

I be not bind 
to give you reason why but know my mind 
which your contest can alter fix 
on what I have relate

the world do credit in you this affront 
shall all her other friend sit idle gazer 
on her disgrace shall stir i to attempt 
a ample satisfaction from your heart 
though you have multitude of great glory 
heap on your head or be defence with legion 
to affright i from the adventure 

sir your courage be just than your quarrel do you think 
I wear a sword only for ornament

Come let not this dishearten you your French 
be a thing easy get and when you have it 
as hard to shake it off run in your blood 
as it be your mother language but there be 
a observation far more necessary 
to improve your judgement still let your discourse 
concern the foreign business and be sure 
to applaud outlandish fashion and take off from 
what be native as if you shall hear 
any commend the Genoa garb or state 
answer in France in Naples or in Spain 
no matter where so it be far enough 
from hence they be more politic more witty 
every way more deserve this will speak 
infinite judicious when to praise 
our own domestic manner be as if 
a man shall praise himself and be account 
a self conceit gull for it 

very good this be a rule I will put in practice I 
thank to my inclination can speak ill 
of my own father signior 

signior still you betray your igorance why signior 
mounsiver have a far more airy and harmonious sound 
there be music in the letter still polish your phrase 
with particle of language which till I have teach you 
perfect answer with a shrug or nod 
or any foreign gesture such a silence 
will be esteem for gravity and become you better 
than volubility of speech do some 
who tongue be gentleman usher to their wit 
still go before it and when you do speak 
let it not be as now you do of news 
abroach ten day before and quite drink of 
but what affair be act then in France 
what in the english court and still remember 
to extol they infinite and if any answer 
comparative with our own a serious laughter 
will not become you ill to show how much 
you slight their error 

better still I like this slight humour infinite but how 
if they shall talk of our italian dame 
I be bind to be their champion for I have hear 
stranger report and I hold their opinion 
our courtesan excel all other nation 

that show those stranger judgement and confirm 
what I will have you understand in England 
where public house be prohibit 
there be the brave lass there some donsella 
that be the last night you shall for two ducat 
tomorrow be a sailor when there 
your citizen wife girl fresh as air and wholesome 
as precious candy wife will meet their gamester 
at a convenient tavern rob their husband 
without a scruple and supply their friend 
while the good innocent cuckold pay a price 
for their own horn 

excellent excellent 
Genoa I do defy thy costive girl 
I will henceforth love these english spark of gold 
will I be there it shall go hard but I 
will graft on their alderman Coxecomb 

they be graft fast already sir beside 
they never get child but their hench boy on 
their sergeant wife after some city feast 
when the provoke spirit of white broth and 
custard inflame their blood what Genoa burgess 
dam res be so bold courage I will tell you 
and mark how base and sordid it appear 
to have our cellar stuff with Corsic wine 
yet for this foolish sin call temperance 
tantalise and never taste it while your dutch 
your noblespirited German will carouse 
a score of goblet to provoke this stomach 
to his bread and butter do nothing but by discreet 
counsel of drink not match his daughter to 
a man he see not drink first scarce say prayer 
till he be full of liquor which inflame 
the mind to generous action 

commend they and will be glad to imitate 

your english 
deserve as large applause who to say truth 
outdrink the dutch as be the common proverb 
the Dutchman drink his button off the english 
doublet and all away then mark their carriage 
if two fall out and strike and be by company 
part though one wear in his face the badge 
of his dishonour which excite he to 
as brave revenge not daunt he for he will straight 
call out his enemy to a single duel 
scorn his life concern the land law 
which do forbid those combat and never part 
till one be slay and the survivor sure 
as death to hang for it 

excellent I love a man that care not for hang 

then to their further glory which take off 
all the disgrace of halter they be sure 
ere they be scarce cold to be chronicle 
in excellent new ballad which be sing 
in the street among boy and girl collier and carman 
be buy as great memorial of their fame 
which to perpetuate they be common stick up 
with as great triumph in the tipple house 
as they be scutcheon 

better yet I will give 
a hundred ducat to be chronicle 
in such a historical canto who compose they 

they have their special poet for that purpose 
such as still drink small beer and so be apt 
to spit out lamentable stuff then for their clothes 
they hate a cut domestic but imitate 
the french precise gallant wear their long 
Parisian breeches with five point at knee 
who tag concur with their harmonious spur 
afford rare music then have they doublet 
so short in the waste they seem as it be beget 
upon their doublet by their cloak which to save stuff 
be but a year growth long than their skirt 
and all this magazine of device be furnish 
by your french tailor what country man be you 

a genoese 

fie change he Monsieur 
you have hear a spanish count vbz 
late arrive without any advice how will you salute he 

thus sir after our italian fashion 

that be too vulgar 
you must accost he thus with a state face 
as if your beard have be turn up that morning 
by advice of all the barber in the city 
as you have dress you in a lookingglass 
proper to none but the duke privy counselor 
pronounce your besolos manas with a grace 
as if you be the son and heir apparent 
to the adelantado of Castille 

Adorni this be no time for mirth 
your noble general have slay lord Bonivet 
and for the act be a prisoner 

Dares the state bereave he of his liberty 
without who most unwearied valour 
it have be betray to slavery 

you know lord bonivet alliance to the duke 

alliance death a thousand bonivet 
and duke and state weigh not 
a scruple poise with his full worth 

he be to be try in the morning without noise 
for fear of mutiny and it be suppose 
that if some virgin lady do not claim 
her privilege and beg his life he will suffer 

if the maid that beg must be above fifteen 
it be shrewd doubt where she will be find 

all our virgin ought if they have virtue to contend 
for such a glory but if all be squeamish 
may all the daughter of our best burgher run 
away with soldier and become sutler wife 

or else when they have a masculine itch upon they 
and will taste man may they be wed to eunuch 

else be force to keep their maidenhead 
till they be musty and not merchantable 
to young brother with addition of wealthy portion 

may they when they will strive to mend their face to allure a suitor want paint and blackpatch to stop the cranny of their cheek may their pomatum be mix with hogsgrease that they may be abominable even in the nose of jew may the greensickness reign in their blood and may they be debar of oat meal and claywall and fall to ratsbane 

May their parent turn most precise precisian 
and forbid they the sight of play or they may never 
dance unless be to a bagpipe or a crowd 

may they want silk for gown and if they seek 
supply from Naples let they instead be furnish 
with their disease may milliner break and featherman 
may my aunt die sudden and bury with her 
all her devise may there be no earth 
find to make lookingglass that they come to use of 
kitchenwench dress their head by the reflection of a 
pail of water or in a pewter chamber vessel

the state as soon will call the enemy 
into their city as pretend the least 
danger to their support column which

best bulwark burn their navy and surrender 
themselves to present slavery

stand on pontilio I can fetch a lady 
of excellent quality shall beg your lordship

Come gentleman let we in brave soul do hate

I be very sorry that his fate have cast 
such a disastrous chance upon his life 
but his desert will blunt the edge of justice 
and mitigate the severity which will 
question the safety of his life 

it be in your mercy 
to dash the law proceed gracious madam 
the privilege that our country give your sex 
can hope for no employment that will raise 
a great trophy to your fame than this 
to ransom he who constancy and truth

that you esteem not worthy your entreat 
to save it from kill ruin sacred love 
thou miracle of mature and delight 
of all who know humanity with some 
religious arrow pierce her flinty breast 
some pious shaft on who subdue point 
pity and amorous softness gentle sit 
reduce this stray schismatic to the first 
unspotted pureness of her constant faith 
and we will pay a thousand cloud of sigh 
as incense to thy altar

thy holy fry 

o madam 
what heart so barbarous do not at love smile 
put off the native fierceness beast with beast 
observe his law the lion who big breath 
affright the tremble people of the wood 
be his hoarse accent to be understand 
they will appear to be affection grove 
the nightingale that on lascivious wing 
fly from the poplar to the tremble beech 
and on each bough chant melancholy note 
have hea humane utterance will proclaim 
those pensive strain the music of his love 
and can you be less sensible of a power 
that be so great than creature bar the use 
of sacred reason and discourse 

this be to seek to pacify the sea 
with tear Vitelli you mistake your friend 
value not at so dear a rate his life 
as to receive a being tributary 
to my unasked entreaty beside I shall 
envy the state prerogative who mercy 
be in remit his unwilling fault 
but a become thankfulness and shall 
be censure as too partial to my own 
affection shall I strive to be his wife 
who hand be purple with the innocent blood 
of my late murder kinsman 

This concern 
as near i as you but by just truth 
though I be engage by my particular choice 
to my Vitelli be I sure the general 
will not contemn my offer and so blast 
my future fame I will disclaim all eye 
of former fancy and implore his safety 

this be a sweetness 
which I can wish you what have beget 
this strange desertion of your faith true love 
be once receive into the soul convert 
into its very essence do become 
the same eternal substance can you then 
tear from the tender cabinet of your breast 
your very heart this cruelty exceed 
the depth of tyranny but est assure 
if Doria suffer by your proud contempt 
I be free then from my promise and will soon 
warm a empoison scorpion in my arm 
then yield my mean thought to you who be 
by evident circumstance though not by fact 
my friend the general murderess 

This Vitelli 
be not a mean to win i to your friend 
but more avert i from he it inflame 
my mind with holy fire to court your love 
there be a evident beauty in your soul 
equal to true honour I will cherish 
this bravery in you if your masculine fancy 
engage you thus constant to a friend 
you will be a loyal husband fare you well 
be still thus noble and be happy 

my sister 
have lose all sense of pity dear Vitelli 
there be no wretchedness oppress earth 
equal to we love thus the tyrant play 
afflict innocence by unusual way 

it be like yourself my noble lord but see 
the duke approach let your soul expect 
a equal hear 

bear back room for the duke and senate what 
cuckold be that will have his coxcomb break bear back there 

cite in the prisoner 

he be here my lord 

I be sorry that 
you for who head the gratitude of the state 
decree triumphant bay shall be enforce 
to stand here a delinquent but the law 
must as a straight and uncorrupted stream 
enjoy its usual freedom my lord 
we be not meet here to arraign a prisoner 
who guilt do speak his sentence but a person 
not only most unblemished in his fame 
but one to who our country owe its life 
who with his dear blood have balm the wound 
which mischief giantoffspring raise war 
cut in the bosom of the commonwealth 

we all confess his worth 

yet this brave youth 
this patron of our liberty all his honour 
his blood and title his defensive bay 
that will have guard his victorious front 
from blast of lightning lay aside be come 
to tender satisfaction to the law 
he have offend and since judgement be 
the immediate act of justice it must pass 
to save impartial censure on his life 
as on the wretched malefactor for 
his former merit can take away 
his present fault for who ere be guilty 
undo the privilege of his desert and blood 
for if great man offend pass unpunished 
the common people who do use to sin 
by their example fearless will run on 
into licentious wickedness 

your grace deliver 
the intention of the state no oracle 
can have explain the meaning of our law 
with more integrity 

yet my good lord 
I speak not this that my particular vengeance 
because slay he my kinsman have the least 
aim at his life which I will strive to cherish 
as my own health or as the city peace 
for magistrate ought to behold their crime 
not the committer as the poet feign 
of wise Tiresias to want eye and only 
have see understanding for a judge 
be guilty of the fault he do not punish 
and if reward and triumph do adorn 
desert it be just that shame and punishment 
shall wait on vice and how much more worthy 
the person be that act they so far sharp 
shall be the penalty inflict on he 

and when the law 
use its utmost rigor it be the crime 
and not the man it sentence 

in brief we must 
decline his merit and forget 
our gratitude and since his hand be dip 
in civil blood his life must expiate what 
his arm unfortunate commit 

my lord 
the service which I have do the state 
be but my natural duty I achieve they 
to gain i fame and glory and you safety and 
shall esteem they traitor to honour if their intercession 
be a protection for my crime I mean not 
to plead to save a disrespect life 
cause I fear death a sea encompass rock 
be not less timorous of the assault wave 
than I of the grim monster but there be 
a fame survive which I will be loath 
shall tell posterity I tame yield 
my head to the axe and die because my spirit 
dare not desire to live to quit this scandal 
I hope what I can urge in my defence 
shall have indifferent hear 

speak free 

know then my intention 
be not by excuse to extenuate my fact 
which I confess most horrid and will I pay 
a thousand shower of sorrow can this hand 
reedify that goodly from of flesh 
which it demolish but my priceless fame 
in who dear cause I slay he will to justice 
bold proclaim I do no more than what 
the truth I owe my reputation tell i 
be right in point of honour 

but the law 
do disallow it as unjust and that 
must be your judge and not that idle breath 
which you abusive term honour 

your law can without partiality pronounce 
judgement against i for they do acquit 
that man of guilt that to defend his life 
be force to slay his enemy my act 
carry the same condition since my fame 
who safety urge i to kill he be my life 
my immortal life as far transcend this 
as the soul do the body for the sword 
return that to its primitive matter dust 
and there it rest forget but a wound 
strike upon reputation leave a brand 
so self diffusive be dishonour guilt 
even to posterity and do revive 
after it have suffer martyrdom 

yet this 
can excuse your fact for civil reason 
allow a reparation for the loss 
of fame but give no man a lawful licence 
to snatch the privilege from the hand of justice 
which will dispose it equal 

this strictness destroy all 
right of manhood since a coward 
may fearful rely on this suffrage 
of law affront even valour self consider 
that the most cunning pilot can steer man 
brittle vessel betwixt these dangerous rock 
of law and honour safe sail by this 
and on that suffer ship wrack for suppose 
I have with patience bear this scandalous name 
of a degenerate coward I not only have 
nip the bud valour of my youth 
as with a kill frost but leave a shame inherent 
to our family disgrace 
my noble father memory defame 
nay coward my ancestor who dust 
will he break through the marble to revenge 
to i this fatal infamy 

Well urge and resolute 

nay more yourselves 
that hate the deed be do will have detest 
the doer worse have it not be perform 
withdraw my charge in the army as from one 
protest for a coward I may then 
have abjure the trade of war in which I have be nurse

of precious honour that hang on my soul

of the exact beauty must I suffer 
the law stern rigor

with circumstance your wrong opinion but in brief 
religious conscience utter disclaim 
a act so barbarous to take man life 
be to destroy heaven image and if those

severe torture on they who deface 
the stamp of prince in their coin can they appear 
as guiltless who rude hand disgrace 
the great creator image and commit 
treason against awful nature o my lord 
collect your serious temper and put off 
the over ween fantasy of youth
