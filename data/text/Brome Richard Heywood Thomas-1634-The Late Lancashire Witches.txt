be ever sport of expectation 
thus cross in the height 

tush these be accident all game be subject to 

so you may call they 
chance or cross or what else you please

as thing transcend nature

a hare a witch or rather a devil I think 
for tell i gentleman be it possible 
in such a fair course and no covert near 
we in pursuit and she in constant view 
our eye not wander but all bent that way 
the dog in chase she ready to be cease 
and at the instant when I dare have lay 
my life to gauge my dog have pinch she than 
to vanish into nothing 

somewhat strange but not as you enforce it 

make it plain 
that I be in a error sure I be 
that I about i have no borrow eye 
they be my own and match 

she may find some muse as then not visible to we 
and escape that way 

perhaps some fox have earth there 
and though it be not common for I seldom 
have know or hear the like there squat herself 
and so her escape appear but natural 
which you proclaim a wonder 

well well gentleman be you of your own faith but what I see 
and be to i apparent be in sense

a four to make we a full mess of guest 
at master generous table

I dare call truth till now 

but wheresoever I lie it be no matter for that 
I pray you say and say truth be not you three now

I think you be a witch master whetstone 

how a witch gentleman I hope you do not mean to abuse i though at this time if report be true there be too many of they here in our country but I be sure I look like no such ugly creature

no such kind of people I pray you tell i gentleman do never any one of you know my mother 

why be your mother a witch 

I do not say as witch go nowadays for they for the most part be ugly old beldame but she be a lusty young lass and by her own report by her beauty and fair look bewitch my father 

it seem then your mother be rather a young wanton wench than a old wither witch 

you say right and know withal I come of two ancient family for as I be a whetstone by the motherside so I be a byblow by the father 

it appear then by your discourse that you come in at the window 

I will have you think I scorn like my granam 
cat to leap over the hatch 

he have confess himself to be a bastard 

and I believe it as a notorious truth 

howsoever I be beget here you see I be 
and if my parent go to it without fear or wit 
what can I help it

what because he have read a little scrivener latin he never proceed far in his accidence than to mentiri non est meum and that be such a hard lesson to learn that he stick at mentiri and can never reach to non est meum since a mere Ignaro and not worth acknowledgement 

be these then the best part he can boast of 

as you see he now so shall you find he ever all in one strain there be one only thing which I wonder he leave our 

and what may that be 

of the same affinity with the rest 
at every second word he his common boast 
either of his aunt or his uncle

of long since banish hospitality 

in that you please i not but gentleman 
I hope to be beholden unto you all

wherein good sir 

I ever study plainness and truth withal

dull as his name and what for kindred sake 
we note not or at least be loath to see 
be unto such wellknowing gentleman 
most gross visible if for my sake 
you will but seem to wink at these his want 
at least at table before we his friend 
I shall receive it as a courtesy 
not soon to be forget

shall I entreat you so much 

o sir you may command we 

in the mean time 
prepare your stomach with a bowl of sack 
my cellar can afford it now mr Arthur 
pray free speak your thought 

I come not sir 
to press a promise from you take it not so 
rather to prompt your memory in a motion 
make to you not long since 

be not about 
a manor the best part of your estate 
mortgage to one slip no advantage 
which you will have redeem 

true sir the same 

and as I think I promise at that time 
to become bind with you or if the usurer 
a base yet the best title I can give he 
perhaps shall question that security 
to have the money ready be not so 

it be to that purpose we discourse 

provide to have the write in my custody 
else how shall I secure my own estate 

to deny that I shall appear to the world 
stupid and of no brain 

your money be ready 

and I remain a man oblige to you 
beyond all utterance 

make then your word good 
by speak it no further only this 
it seem your uncle you trust in so far 
have fail your expectation 

sir he have not that he be unwilling or unable 
but at this time unfit to be solicit 
for to the country wonder and my sorrow 
he be much to be pity 

why I entreat you 

because he be late become the sole discourse 
of all the country for of a man respect 
for his discretion and know gravity 
as master of a govern family 
the house as if the ridge be fix below 
and groundfill lift up to make the roof 
all now turn topsyturvy 

strange but how 

in such a retrograde and preposterous way 
as seldom have be hear of I think never 

can you discourse the manner 

the good man in all obedience kneel unto his son 
he with a austere brow command his father 
the wife presume not in the daughter sight 
without a prepare courtesy the girl she 
expect it as a duty chide her mother 
who quake and tremble at each word she speak 
and what be as strange the maid she domineer 
over her young mistress who be awe by she 
the son to who the father creep and bend 
stand in as much fear of the groom his man 
all in such rare disorder that in some 
as it breed pity and in other wonder 
so in the most part laughter 

How think you may this come 

it be think by witchcraft 

they that think so dream 
for my belief be no such thing can be 
a madness you may call it dinner stay 
that do the best part of the afternoon 
we will spend about your business 

nay but understand i neighbour doughty 

good master Seely I do understand you and over and over understand you so much that I can even blush at your fondness and have I a son to serve i so I will conjure a devil out of he 

Alas he be my child

and find they do i good on my own part 
indeed they do reclaim i from those error 
that may impeach his fortune but I fear 
the unquiet strife within he hurt himself 
and waste or weaken nature by the breach 
of moderate sleep and diet and I can 
no less than grieve to find my weakness 
to be the cause of his affliction 
and see the danger of his health and be
