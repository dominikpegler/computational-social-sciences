i find Eumenides in all thing both variety to content and satiety to glut save only in my affection which be so stay and withal so stately that I can neither satisfy my heart with love nor my eye with wonder my thought Eumenides be stitch to the star which be as high as I can see thou may imagine how much high they be then I can reach 

if you be enamour of any thing above the moon your thought be ridiculous for that thing immortal be not subject to affection if allure or enchant with these transitory thing under the moon you show yourself senseless to attribute such lofty title to such love trifle 

my love be place neither under the moon nor above 

I hope you be not sot upon the man in the moon 

no but settle either to die or possess the moon herself 

be Endymion mad or do I mistake do you love the moon Endymion 

Eumenides the moon 

there be never any so peevish to imagine the moon either capable of affection or shape of a mistress for as impossible it be to make love fit to her humour which no man know as a coat to her form which continue not in one bigness while she be measure cease of Endymion to feed so much upon fancy that melancholy blood must be purge which draw you to a dotage no less miserable than monstrous 

my thought have no vein and yet unless they be let blood I shall perish 

but they have vanity which be reform you may be restore 

o fair Cynthia why do other term thou unconstant who I have ever find unmoveable injurious time corrupt manner unkind man who find a constancy not to be match in my sweet mistress have christen she with the name of waver wax and wane be she inconstant that keep a settle course which since her first creation alter not one minute in her move there be nothing think more admirable or commendable in the sea than the ebb and flow and shall the moon from who the sea take this virtue be account fickle for increase and decrease flower in their bud be nothing worth till they be blow nor blossom account till they be ripe fruit and shall we then say they be changeable for that they grow from seed to leaf from leaf to bud from bud to their perfection then why be not twig that become tree child that become man and morning that grow to evening term waver for that they continue not at one stay I but Cynthia be in her fullness decay as not delight in her great beauty or wither when she shall be most honour when malice can object any thing folly will make that a vice which be the great virtue what thing my mistress except be in the pride of her beauty and latter minute of her age that wax young again tell i Eumenides what be he that have a mistress of ripe year and infinite virtue great honour and unspeakable beauty but will wish that she may grow tender again get youth by year and never decay beauty by time who fair face neither the summer blaze can scorch nor winter blast chap nor the number of year breed alter of colour such be my sweet Cynthia who time can touch because she be divine nor will offend because she be delicate o Cynthia if thou shall always continue at thy fullness both god and man will conspire to ravish thou but thou to abate the pride of our affection do detract from thy perfection think it sufficient if once in a month we enjoy a glimpse of thy majesty and then to increase our grief thou do decrease thy gleam come out of thy royal robe wherewith thou dazzle our eye down into thy swath clout beguile our eye and then 

stay there Endymion thou that commit idolatry will straight blaspheme if thou be suffer sleep will do thou more good than speech the moon hear thou not or if she do regard thou not 

vain Eumenides who thought never grow high than the crown of thy head why trouble thou i have neither head to conceive the cause of my love or a heart to receive the impression follow thou thy own fortune which creep on the earth and suffer i to fly to i who fall though it be desperate yet shall it come by dare farewell 

without doubt Endymion be bewitch otherwise in a man of such rare virtue there can not harbour a mind of such extreme madness I will follow he lest in this fancy of the moon he deprive himself of the sight of the sun 

treacherous and most perjure Endymion be Cynthia the sweetness of thy life and the bitterness of my death what revenge may be devise so full of shame as my thought be replenish with malice tell i Floscula if falseness in love can possible be punish with extremity of hate as long as sword fire or poison may be hire no traitor to my love shall live unrevenged Were thy oath without number thy kiss without measure thy sigh without end forge to deceive a poor credulous virgin who simplicity have be worth thy favour and better fortune if the god sit unequal beholder of injury or laugher at lover deceit then let mischief be as well forgive in woman as perjury wink at in man 

madam if you will compare the state of Cynthia with your own and the height of Endymion his thought with the meanness of your fortune you will rather yield than contend be between you and she no comparison and rather wonder than rage at the greatness of his mind be affect with a thing more than mortal 

no comparison floscula and why so be not my beauty divine who body be deck with fair flower and vein be vine yield sweet liquor to the dull spirit who ear be corn to bring strength and who hair be grass to bring abundance do not frankincense and mirth breath out of my nostril and all the sacrifice of the god breed in my bowel infinite be my creature without which neither thou nor Endymion nor any can love or live 

but know you not fair lady that Cynthia govern all thing your grape will be but dry husk your corn but chaff and all your virtue vain be it not Cynthia that preserve the one in the bud and nourish the other in the blade and by her influence both comfort all thing and by her authority command all creature suffer then Endymion to follow his affection though to obtain she be impossible and let he flatter himself in his own imagination because they be immortal 

loath I be Endymion thou shall die because I love thou well and that thou shall live it grieve i because thou love Cynthia too well in these extremity what shall I do Floscula no more word I be resolve he shall neither live nor die 

a strange practice if it be possible 

yes I will entangle he in such a sweet net that he shall neither find the mean to come out nor desire it all allurement of pleasure will I cast before his eye insomuch that he shall slake that love which he now vow to Cynthia and burn in i of which he seem careless in this languish between my amorous devise and his own loose desire there shall such dissolute thought take root in his head and over his heart grow so thick a skin that neither hope of preferment nor fear of punishment nor counsel of the wise nor company of the worthy shall alter his humour nor make he once to think of his honour 

a revenge incredible and if it may be unnatural 

he shall know the malice of a woman to have neither mean nor end and of a woman delude in love to have neither rule nor reason I can do it I must I will all his virtue will I shadow with vice his person ah sweet person shall he deck with such rich robe as he shall forget it be his own person his sharp wit ah wit too sharp that have cut off all my joy shall he use in flatter of my face and devise sonnet in my favour the prime of his youth and pride of his time shall be spend in melancholy passion careless behaviour untamed thought and unbridle affection 

when this be do what then shall it continue till his death or shall he dote for ever in this delight 

ah Floscula thou rend my heart in sunder in put i in remembrance of the end 

why if this be not the end all the rest be to no end 

yet suffer i to imitate Juno who will turn Jupiter lover to beast on the earth though she know afterward they shall be star in heaven 

affection that be breed by enchantment be like a flower that be wrought in silk in colour and form most like but nothing at all in substance or savour 

it shall suffice i if the world talk that I be favour of Endymion 

well use your own will but you shall find that love get with witchcraft be as unpleasant as fish take with medicine unwholesome 

they that be so poor that they have neither net nor hook will rather poison dough then pine with hunger and she that be so oppress with love that she be neither able with beauty nor wit to obtain her friend will rather use unlawful mean then try untolerable pain I will do it 

then about it poor Endymion what trap be lay for thou because thou honour one that all the world wonder at and what plot be cast to make thou unfortunate that study of all man to be the faithful 

now our master be in love up to the ear what have we to do but to be in knavery up to the crown 

o that we have sir Tophas that brave squire in the midst of our mirth & ecce autem will you see the devil 

epi 

here sir 

I brook not this idle humour of love it tickle not my liver from whence the lovemonger in former age seem to infer they shall proceed 

love sir may lie in your lung and I think it do and that be the cause you blow and be so pursy 

tush boy I think it but some devise of the poet to get money 

a poet what be that 

do thou not know what a poet be

why fool a poet be as much as one shall say a poet but soft yonder be two wren shall I shoot at they

stay your courage valiant knight for your wisdom be so weary that it stay itself 

why sir Tophas have you forget your old friend

because Amicitia as in old annual we find be inter pares now my pretty companion you shall see how unequal you be to i but I will not cut you quite off you shall be my half friend for reach to my middle so far as from the ground to the waist I will be your friend 

learned but what shall become of the rest of your body from the waist to the crown 

my child quod supra vos nihil ad vos you must think the rest immortal because you can reach it 

nay I tell you my master be more than a man 

and thou less than a mouse 

but what be you two 

I be Samias page to Endymion 

and I Dares page to Eumenides 

of what occupation be your master 

occupation you clown why they be honourable and warrior 

then be they my prentice 

thou and why so 

I be the first that ever devise war and therefore by Mars himself give i for my arm a whole armoury and thus I go as you see clothe with artillery it be not silk milksop nor tissue nor the fine wool of care but iron steel sword flame shot terror clamour blood and ruin that rock asleep my thought which never have any other cradle but cruelty let i see do you not bleed 

why so 

common my word wound 

what then do your blow 

not only confound but also confound 

how dare thou come so near thy master epi sir Tophas spare we 

you shall live you Samias because you be little you Dares because you be no big and both of you because you be but two for common I kill by the dozen and have for every particular adversary a peculiar weapon 

may we know the use for our better skill in war 

you shall here be a burbolt for the ugly beast the blackbird 

a cruel sight 

here be the musket for the untamed or as the vulgar sort term it the wild mallard 

o desperate attempt 

nay my master will match they 

i if he catch they 

here be a spear and shield and both necessary the one to conquer the other to subdue or overcome the terrible trout which although he be under the water yet tie a string to the top of my spear and a engine of iron to the end of my line I overthrow he and then herein I put he 

o wonderful war Dares do thou ever hear such a dolt 

all the better we shall have good sport hereafter if we can get leisure 

leisure I will rather lose my master service then his company look how he strut but what be this call you it your sword 

no it be my scimitar which I by construction often study to be compendious call my smiter 

what be you also learned sir 

learned I be all mar and Ars 

nay you be all mass and ass 

mock you i you shall both suffer yet with such weapon as you shall make choice of the weapon wherewith you shall perish be I all a mass or lump be there no proportion in i be I all ass be there no wit in i epi prepare they to the slaughter 

I pray sir hear we speak we call you mass which your learning do well understand be all man for master maris be a man then as as you know be a weight and we for your virtue account you a weight 

the latin have save your life the which a world of silver can not have ransom I understand you and pardon you 

well sir Tophas we bid you farewell and at our next meeting we will be ready to do you service 

I thank you Dares I thank you but especial I thank you both 

wise Come next time we will have some pretty gentlewoman with we to walk for without doubt with they he will be very dainty 

Come let we see what our master do it be high time 

now will I march into the field where if I can encounter with my foul enemy I will withdraw myself to the river and there fortify for fish for there rest no minute free from fight 

behold Floscula we have meet with the woman by chance that we seek for by travel I will break my mind to she without ceremony or circumstance lest we lose that time in advice that shall be spend in execution 

use your discretion I will in this case neither give counsel nor consent for there can be a thing more monstrous than to force affection by sorcery neither do I imagine any thing more impossible 

tush Floscula in obtain of love what impossibility will I not try and for the win of Endymion what impiety will I not practise Dipsas who as many honour for age as wonder at for cunning listen in few word to my tale and answer in one word to the purpose for that neither my burn desire can afford long speech nor the short time I have to stay many delay be it possible by herb stone spell incantation enchantment exorcism fire metal planet or any practice to plant affection where it be not and to supplant it where it be 

fair lady you may imagine that these hoary hair be not void of experience nor the great name that go of my cunning to be without cause I can darken the sun by my skill and remove the moon out of her course I can restore youth to the age and make hill without bottom there be nothing that I can not do but that only which you will have i do and therein I differ from the god that I be not able to rule heart for be it in my power to place affection by appointment I will make such evil appetite such inordinate lust such curse desire as all the world shall be fill both with superstitious heat and extreme love 

unhappy Tellus who desire be so desperate that they be neither to be conceive of any creature nor to be cure by any art 

this I can breed slackness in love though never root it out what be he who you love and what she that he honour 

Endymion sweet Endymion be he that have my heart and Cynthia too too fair Cynthia the miracle of nature of time of fortune be the lady that he delight in and dote on every day and die for ten thousand time a day 

will you have his love either by absence of sickness aslake will you that Cynthia shall mistrust he or be jealous of he without colour 

it be the only thing I crave that see my love to Endymion unspotted can be accept his truth to Cynthia though it be unspeakable may be suspect 

I will undertake it and overtake he that all his love shall be doubt of and therefore become desperate but this will wear out with time that tread all thing down but truth 

let we go 

I follow 

o fair Cynthia o unfortunate Endymion why be not thy birth as high as thy thought or her beauty less than heavenly or why be not thy honour as rare as her beauty or thy fortune as great as thy desert sweet Cynthia how will thou be please how possess will labour patient of all extremity obtain thy love there be no mountain so steep that I will not climb no monster so cruel that I will not tame no action so desperate that I will not attempt desire thou the passion of love the sad and melancholy mood of perplex mind the not to be express torment of rack thought behold my sad tear my deep sigh my hollow eye my break sleep my heavy countenance will thou have i vow only to thy beauty and consume every minute of time in thy service remember my solitary life almost these seven year who have I entertain but my own thought and thy virtue what company have I use but contemplation who have I wonder at but thou nay who have I not contemn for thou have I not creep to those on who I may have tread only because thou do shine upon they have not injury be sweet to i if thou vouchsafe I shall bear they have I not spend my golden year in hope wax old with wish yet wish nothing but thy love with Tellus fair Tellus have I dissemble use she but as a cloak for my affection that other see my mangle and disorder mind may think it be for one that love i not for Cynthia who perfection allow no companion nor comparison 
in the midst of these distemper thought of i thou be not only jealous of my truth but careless suspicious and secure which strange humour make my mind as desperate as thy conceit be doubtful I be none of those wolf that bark most when thou shine bright but that fish thy fish Cynthia in the flood Aranis which at thy wax be as white as the drive snow and at thy wane as black as deep darkness I be that Endymion sweet Cynthia that have carry my thought in equal balance with my action be always as free from imagine ill as enterprise that Endymion who eye never esteem any thing fair but thy face who tongue term nothing rare but thy virtue and who heart imagine nothing miraculous but thy government yea that Endymion who divorce himself from the amiableness of all lady the bravery of all court the company of all man have choose in a solitary cell to live only by feed on thy favour account in the world but thyself nothing excellent nothing immortal thus may thou see every vain sinew muscle and artery of my love in which there be no flattery nor deceit error nor art but soft here come Tellus I must turn my other face to her like janus lest she be as suspicious as Juno 

yonder I espy Endymion I will seem to suspect nothing but soothe he that see I can obtain the depth of his love I may learn the height of his dissemble Floscula and Dipsas withdraw yourselves out of our sight yet be within the hear of our salute how now Endymion always solitary no company but your own thought no friend but melancholy fancy 

you know fair Tellus that the sweet remembrance of your love be the only companion of my life and thy presence my paradise so that I be not alone when nobody be with i and in heaven itself when thou be with i 

then you love i Endymion 

or else I live not Tellus 

be it not possible for you Endymion to dissemble 

not Tellus unless I can make i a woman 

why be dissemble join to their sex inseparable as heat to fire heaviness to earth moisture to water thinness to air 

no but find in their sex as common as spot upon dove mole upon face caterpillar upon sweet apple cobweb upon fair window 

do they all dissemble 

all but one 

who be that 

I dare not tell for if I shall say you then will you imagine my flattery to be extreme if another then will you think my love to be but indifferent 

you will be sure I shall take no vantage of your word but in sooth Endymion without more ceremony be it not Cynthia 

you know tellus that of the god we be forbid to dispute because their deity come not within the compass of our reason and of Cynthia we be allow not to talk but to wonder because her virtue be not within the reach of our capacity 

why she be but a woman 

no more be Venus 

Shee be but a virgin 

no more be Vesta 

she shall have a end 

so shall the world 

be not her beauty subject to time 

no more than time be to stand still 

will thou make she immortal 

no but incomparable 

take heed Endymion lest like the wrestler in Olimpia that strive to lift a impossible weight catch a incurable strain thou by fix thy thought above thy reach fall into a disease without all recure but I see thou be now in love with Cynthia 

no Tellus thou know that the stately cedar who top reach unto the cloud never bow his head to the shrub that grow in the valley nor ivy that climb up by the elm can ever get hold of the beam of the sun Cynthia I honour in all humility who none ought or dare adventure to love who affection be immortal and virtue infinite suffer i therefore to gaze on the moon at who be it not for thyself I will die with wonder 

Come Samias do thou ever hear such a sigh the one for Cynthia the other for Semele and both for moon shine in the water 

let they sigh and let we sing how say you gentlewoman be not our master too far in love 

their tongue happy be dip to the root in amorous word and sweet discourse but I think their heart be scarce tip on the side with constant desire 

How say you Favilla be not love a lurcher that take man stomach away that they can eat their spleen that they can laugh their heart that they can fight their eye that they can sleep and leave nothing but liver to make nothing but lover 

away peevish boy a rod be better under thy girdle than love in thy mouth it will be a forward cock that crow in the shell 

alas good old gentlewoman how it become you to be grave 

Favilla though she be but a spark yet be she fire 

and you scintilla be not much more than a spark though you will be esteem a flame 

it be good sport to see the fight between two spark 

let they to it and we will warm we by their word 

you be not angry Favilla 

that be scintilla as you list to take it 

that that 

this it be to be match with girl who come but yesterday from make of baby will before to morrow be account matron 

I cry your matronship mercy because your pantofle be high with cork therefore your foot must needs be high in the instep you will be my elder because you stand upon a stool and I on the flower 

good good 

let they alone and see with what countenance they will become friend 

nay you think to be the wise because you mean to have the last word 

step between they lest they scratch in faith gentlewoman see we come out to be merry let not your jar mar our jest be friend how say you 

I be not angry but it spite i to see how short she be 

I mean nothing till she will needs cross i 

then so let it rest 

I be agree 

and I yet I never take any thing so unkind in my life 

it be I have the cause that never offer the occasion 

excellent and right like a woman 

a strange sight to see water come out of fire 

it be their property to carry in their eye fire and water tear and torch and in their mouth honey and gall 

you will be a good one if you live but what be yonder formal fellow 

sir Tophas sir Tophas of who we tell you if you be good wench make as though you love he and wonder at he 

we will do our part 

but first let we stand aside and let he use his garb for all consist in his grace 

epi 

at hand sir 

how like thou this martial life where nothing but blood besprinkle our bosom let i see be our enemy fat 

pass fat and I will not change this life to be a lord and yourself pass all comparison for other captain kill and beat and there be nothing you kill but you also eat 

I will draw out their gut out of their belly and tear the flesh with my tooth so mortal be my hate and so eager my unstaunched stomach 

my master think himself the valiant man in the world if he kill a wren so warlike a thing he account to take away life though it be from a lark 

epi I find my thought to swell and my spirit to take wing in so much that I can continue within the compass of so slender combat 

This pass 

why be he not mad 

no but a little vain glorious 

epi 

sir 

I will encounter that black and cruel enemy that bear rough and unhewed lock upon his body who sire throw down the strong wall who leg be as many as both we on who head be place most horrible horn by nature as a defence from all harm 

what mean you master to be so desperate 

honour incit i and very hunger compel i 

what be that monster 

the monster Ouis I have say let thy wit work 

I can imagine it yet let i see a black enemy with rough lock it may be a sheep and ouis be a sheep his sire so strong a ram be a sheep sire that be also a engine of war horn he have and four leg so have a sheep without doubt this monster be a black sheep be it not a sheep that you mean 

thou have hit it that monster will I kill and sup with 

Come let we take he off sir Tophas all hail 

welcome child I seldom cast my eye so low as to the crown of your head and therefore pardon i that I speak not all this while 

no harm do here be fair lady come to wonder at your person your valour your wit the report whereof have make they careless of their own honour to glut their eye and heart upon you 

report can but injure i for that not know full what I be I fear she have be a niggard in her praise 

no gentle knight report have be prodigal for she have leave you not equal nor herself credit so much have she tell yet no more than we now see 

a good wench 

if there remain as much pity towards woman as there be in you courage against your enemy then shall we be happy who hear of your person come to see it and see it be now in love with it 

love i lady I easy believe it but my tough heart receive no impression with sweet word Mars may pierce it Venus shall not paint on it 

a cruel say 

there be a girl 

will you cast these lady away and all for a little love do but speak kind 

there come no soft syllable within my lip custom have make my word bloody and my heart barbarous that pelt word love how waterish it be in my mouth it carry no sound hate horror death be speech that nourish my spirit I like honey but I care not for the bee I delight in music but I love not to play on the bagpipe I can vouchsafe to hear the voice of woman but to touch their body I disdain it as a thing childish and fit for such man as can digest nothing but milk 

a hard heart shall we die for your love and find no remedy 

I have already take a surfeit 

good master pity they 

pity they epi no I do not think that this breast shall be pester with such a foolish passion what be that the gentlewoman carry in a chain 

why it be a squirrel 

a squirrel o god what thing be make for money 

be not this gentleman overwise 

I can stay all day with he if I fear not to be shend 

be it not possible to meet again 

yes at any time 

then let we hasten home 

sir Tophas the god of war deal better with you than you do with the god of love 

our love we may dissemble digest we can but I doubt not but time will hamper you and help we 

I defy time who have no interest in my heart come epi let i to the battle with that hideous beast love be pap and have no relish in my taste because it be not terrible 

indeed a black sheep be a perilous beast but let we in till another time 

I shall long for that time 

no rest Endymion still uncertain how to settle thy step by day or thy thought by night thy truth be measure by thy fortune and thou be judge unfaithful because thou be unhappy I will see if I can beguile myself with sleep and if no slumber will take hold in my eye yet will I embrace the golden thought in my head and wish to melt by muse that as ebony which no fire can scorch be yet consume with sweet savour so my heart which can be bend by the hardness of fortune may be bruise by amorous desire on yonder bank never grow any thing but lunary and hereafter I will never have any bed but that bank o Endymion Tellus be fair but what avail beauty without wisdom nay Endymion she be wise but what avail wisdom without honour Shee be honourable Endymion belie she not I but how obscure be honour without fortune be she not fortunate who so many follow yes yes but base be fortune without majesty thy majesty Cynthia all the world know and wonder at but not one in the world that can imitate it or comprehend it no more Endymion sleep or die nay die for to sleep it be impossible and yet I know not how it come to pass I feel such a heaviness both in my eye and heart that I be sudden benumb yea in every joint it may be weariness for when do I rest it may be deep melancholy for when do I not sigh Cynthia I so I say Cynthia 

little do thou know Endymion when thou shall wake for have thou place thy heart as low in love as thy head lie now in sleep thou may have command Tellus who now in stead of a mistress thou shall find a tomb these eye must I seal up by art not nature which be to be open neither by art nor nature thou that lie down with golden lock shall not awake until they be turn to silver hair and that chin on which scarce appear soft down shall be fill with bristle as hard as broom thou shall sleep out thy youth and flower time and become dry hay before thou know thyself green grass and ready by age to step into the grave when thou wake that be youthful in the court when thou lay thou down to sleep the malice of Tellus have bring this to pass which if she can not have entreat of i by fair mean she will have command by menace for from her gather we all our simples to maintain our sorcery fan with this hemlock over his face and sing the enchantment for sleep while I go in and finish those ceremony that be require in our art take heed you touch not his face for the fan be so season that who so it touch with a leaf shall present die and over who the wind of it breathe he shall sleep for ever 

let i alone I will be careful what hap have thou Endymion to come under the hand of Dipsas o fair Endymion how it grieve i that that fair face must be turn to a wither skin and taste the pain of death before it feel the reward of love I fear tellus will repent that which the heaven themselves seem to rue but I hear Dipsas come I dare not repine lest she make i pine and rock i into such a deep sleep that I shall not awake to my marriage 

how now have you finish 

yea 

well then let we in and see that you do not so much as whisper that I do this for if you do I will turn thy hair to adder and all thy tooth in thy head to tongue come away come away 

be the report true that Endymion be strike into such a dead sleep that nothing can either wake he or move he 

too true madam and as much to be pity as wonder at 

as good sleep and do no harm as wake and do no good 

what make you tellus to be so short the time be Endymion only be 

it be a old say madam that a wake dog do afar off bark at a sleep lion 

it be good Eumenides that you take a nap with your friend for your speech begin to be heavy 

contrary to your nature Semele which have be always account light 

what have we here before my face these unseemly and malapert overthwart I will tame your tongue and your thought and make your speech answerable to your duty and your conceit fit for my dignity else will I banish you both my person and the world 

pardon I humble ask but such be my unspotted faith to Endymion that whatsoever seem a needle to prick his finger be a dagger to wound my heart 

if you be so dear to he how happen it you neither go to see he nor search for remedy for he 

I have see he to my grief and seek recure with despair for that I can imagine who shall restore he that be the wonder to all man your highness on who hand the compass of the earth be at command though not in possession may show yourself both worthy your sex your nature and your favour if you redeem that honourable Endymion who ripe year foretell rare virtue and who unmellowed conceit promise ripe counsel 

I have have trial of Endymion and conceive great assurance of his age than I can hope of his youth 

but timely madam crook that tree that will be a cammock and young it prick that will be a thorn and therefore he that begin without care to settle his life it be a sign without amendment he will end it 

presumptuous girl I will make thy tongue a example of unrecoverable displeasure Corsites carry she to the castle in the desert there to remain and weave 

shall she work story or poetry 

it skill not which go to in both for she shall find example infinite in either what punishment long tongue have Eumenides if either the soothsayers in Egypt or the enchanter in Thessaly or the philosopher in Greece or all the sage of the world can find remedy I will procure it therefore dispatch with all speed you Eumenides into Thessaly you Zontes into Greece because you be acquaint in Athens you Panthon to Egypt say that Cynthia send and if you will command 

on bow knee I give thank and with wing on my leg I fly for remedy 

we be ready at your highness command and hope to return to your full content 

it shall never be say that Cynthia who mercy and goodness fill the heaven with joy and the world with marvel will suffer either Endymion or any to perish if he may be protect 

your majesty word have be always deed and your deed virtue 

here be the castle fair Tellus in which you must weave till either time end your day or Cynthia her displeasure I be sorry so fair a face shall be subject to so hard a fortune and that the flower of beauty which be honour in court shall here wither in prison 

Corsites Cynthia may restrain the liberty of my body of my thought she can and therefore do I esteem myself most free though I be in great bondage 

can you then feed on fancy and subdue the malice of envy by the sweetness of imagination 

Corsites there be no sweet music to the miserable then despair and therefore the more bitterness I feel the more sweetness I find for so vain be liberty and so unwelcome the follow of high fortune that I choose rather to pine in this castle than to be a prince in any other court 

a humour contrary to your year and nothing agreeable to your sex the one common allure with delight the other always with sovereignty 

I marvel Corsites that you be a captain who shall sound nothing but terror and suck nothing but blood can find in your heart to talk such smooth word for that it agree not with your call to use word so soft as that of love 

lady it be unfit of war to discourse with woman into who mind nothing can sink but smoothness beside you must not think that soldier be so rough hew or of such knotty mettle that beauty can allure and you be beyond perfection enchant 

good Corsites talk not of love but let i to my labour the little beauty I have shall be bestow on my loom which I now mean to make my lover 

let we in and what favour Corsites can show Tellus shall command 

the only favour I desire be now and then to walk

Non formosus erat sed erat facundus Ulysses

quicquid conabar dicere versus erat epi I feel all Ovid the art amandi lie as heavy at my heart as a load of log o what a fine thin hair have Dipsas what a pretty low forehead what a tale and stately nose what little hollow eye what great and goodly lip how harmless she be be toothless her finger fat and short adorn with long nail like a bitter in how sweet a proportion her cheek hang down to her breast like dug and her pap to her waste like bag what a low stature she be and yet what a great foot she carry how thrifty must she be in who there be no waste how virtuous be she like to be over who no man can be jealous 

stay master you forget yourself 

o epi even as a dish melt by the fire so do my wit increase by love 

pithy and to the purpose but what begin you to nod 

good epi let i take a nap for as some man may better steal a horse then another look over the hedge so diverse shall be sleepy when they will fain take rest 

whoever see such a woodcock love Dipsas without doubt all the world will now account he valiant that venture on she who none dare undertake but here come two wag 

thy master have sleep his share 

I think he do it because he will not pay i my board wage 

it be a thing most strange and I think my will never return so that we must both seek new master for we shall never live by our manner 

if you want master join with i and serve sir Tophas who must needs keep more man because he be towards marriage 

what epi where be thy master

why in marry Dipsas he shall have every day twelve dish of meat to his dinner though there be none but Dipsas with he four of flesh four of fish four of fruit

for fish these crab carp lump and pout 

excellent for of my word she be both crabbish lumpish and carp 

for fruit these fretter meddler artichoke and lady long thus you see he shall fare like a king though he be but a beggar 

Well epi dine thou with he for I have rather fast than see her face but see thy Ma be asleep let we have a song to wake this amorous knight 

agree 

content 

sleep be a bind of the sense love a lose 

let we hear he awhile 

there appear in my sleep a goodly owl who sit upon my shoulder cry twit twit and before my eye present herself the express image of Dipsas I marvel what the owl say till at the last I perceive twit twit to it to it only by contraction admonish by this vision to make account of my sweet Venus 

sir Tophas you have oversleep yourself 

no youth I have but sleep over my love 

love why it be impossible that into so noble and unconquered a courage love shall creep have first a head as hard to pierce as steel than to pass to a heart arm with a shirt of male 

ay but my master yawn one day in the sun love creep into his mouth before he can close it and there keep such a tumble in his body that he be glad to untruss the point of his heart and entertain love as a stranger 

if there remain any pity in you plead for i to Dipsas 

plead nay we will press she to it let we go with he to Dipsas and there shall we have good sport but sir Tophas when shall we go for I find my tongue voluble and my heart venturous and all myself like myself 

Come dare let we not lose he till we find our master for as long as he live we shall lack neither mirth nor meat 

we will travice will you go sir 

I praesequar 

father your sad music be tune on the same key that my hard fortune be have so melt my mind that I wish to hang at your mouth end tell my life end 

these tune gentleman have I be accustom with these fifty winter have no other house to shroud myself but the broad heaven and so familiar with i have use make misery that I esteem sorrow my chief solace and welcome be that guest to i that can rehearse the sad tale or the bloody tragedy 

a strange humour may I inquire the cause 

you must pardon i if I deny to tell it for know that the reveal of grief be as it be a renew of sorrow I have vow therefore to conceal they that I may not only feel the depth of everlasting discontentment but despair of remedy but whence be you what fortune have thrust you to this distress 

I be go to Thessaly to seek remedy for Endymion my dear friend who have be cast into a dead sleep almost these twenty year wax old and ready for the grave be almost but new come forth of the cradle 

you need not for recure travel far for who so can clear see the bottom of this fountain shall have remedy for any thing 

that methinks be unpossible why what virtue can there be in water 

yes whosoever can shed the tear of a faithful lover shall obtain any thing he will read these word engrave about the brim 

have you know this by experience or be it place here of purpose to delude man 

I only will have experience of it and then shall there be a end of my misery and then will I tell the strange discourse that ever yet be hear 

ah Eumenides 

what lack you gentleman be you not well 

yes father but a qualm that often come over my heart do now take hold of i but do never any lover come hither 

lustre but not lover for often have I see they weep but never can I hear they see the bottom 

come there woman also 

some 

what do they see 

they all weep that the fountain overflow with tear but so thick become the water with their tear that I can scarce discern the brim much less behold the bottom 

be faithful lover so scant 

it seem so for yet hear I never of any 

ah Eumenides how be thou perplex call to mind the beauty of thy sweet mistress and the depth of thy never die affection how oft have thou honour she not only without spot but suspicion of falsehood and how hardly have she reward thou without cause or colour of despite 
how secret haste thou be these seven year that have not nor once dare not to name she for discontent she how faithful that have offer to die for she to please she unhappy Eumenides 

why gentleman do you once love 

once I father and ever shall 

be she unkind and you faithful 

Shee of all woman the most froward and I of all creature the most fond 

you dote then not love for affection be ground on virtue and virtue be never peevish or on beauty and beauty love to be praise 

ay but if all virtuous lady shall yield to all that be love or all amiable gentlewoman entertain all that be amorous their virtue will be account vice and their beauty deformity for that love can be but between two and that not proceed of he that be most faithful but most fortunate 

I will you be so faithful that your tear may make you fortunate 

yea father if that my tear clear not this fountain then may you swear it be but a mere mockery 

So say every one yet that weep 

ah I faint I die ah sweet Semele let i alone and dissolve by weep into water 

this affection seem strange if he see nothing without doubt this dissemble pass for nothing shall draw i from the belief 

father I plain see the bottom and there in white marble engrave these word ask one for all and but one thing at all 

o fortunate Eumenides for so have I hear thou call thyself let i see I can discern any such thing I think thou dream 

ah father thou be not a faithful lover and therefore can not behold it 

then ask that I may be satisfy by the event and thyself bless 

ask so I will and what shall I do but ask and who shall I ask but Semele the possess of who person be a pleasure that can come within the compass of comparison who golden lock seem most curious when they seem most careless who sweet look seem most allure when they be most chaste and who word the more virtuous they be the more amorous they be account I pray thou fortune when I shall first meet with fair Semele dash my delight with some light disgrace least embrace sweetness beyond measure I take a surfeit without recure let she practise her accustom coyness that I may diet my self upon my desire otherwise the fullness of my joy will diminish the sweetness and I shall perish by they before I possess they 
why do I trifle the time in word the least minute be spend in the get of Semele be more worth than the whole world therefore let i ask what now Eumenides whether be thou draw have thou forget both friendship and duty care of Endymion and the commandment of Cynthia shall he die in a leaden sleep because thou sleep in a golden dream ay let he sleep ever so I slumber but one minute with Semele love know neither friendship nor kindred 
shall I not hazard the loss of a friend for the obtain of she for who I will often lose myself fond Eumenides shall the entice beauty of a most disdainful lady be of more force than the rare fidelity of a try friend the love of man to woman be a thing common and of course the friendship of man to man infinite and immortal tush Semele do possess my love I but Endymion have deserve it I will help Endymion I find Endymion unspotted in his truth I but I shall find Semele constant in her love I will have Semele what shall I do father thy grey hair be ambassador of experience which shall I ask 

Eumenides release Endymion for all thing friendship except be subject to fortune love be but a eye worm which only tickle the head with hope and wish friendship the image of eternity in which there be nothing movable nothing mischievous as much difference as there be between beauty and virtue body and shadow colour and life so great odds be there between love and friendship 
love be a chameleon which draw nothing into the mouth but air and nourish nothing in the body but lung believe i Eumenides desire die in the same moment that beauty sicken and beauty fade in the same instant that it flourish when adversity flow than love ebb but friendship stand stiff in storm time draw wrinkle in a fair face but add fresh colour to a fast friend which neither heat nor cold nor misery nor place nor destiny can alter or diminish o friendship of all thing the most rare and therefore most rare because most excellent who comfort in misery be always sweet and who counsel in prosperity be ever fortunate vain love that only come near to friendship in name will seem to be the same or better in nature 

father I allow your reason and will therefore conquer my own virtue shall subdue affection wisdom lust friendship beauty mistress be in every place and as common as hare in Atho bee in Hybla fowl in the air but friend to be find be like the phoenix in Arabia but one or the Philadelphi in Arays never above two I will have Endymion sacred fountain in who bowel be hide divine secret I have increase your water with the tear of unspotted thought and therefore let i receive the reward you promise Endymion the true friend to i and faithful lover to Cynthia be in such a dead sleep that nothing can wake or move he 

do thou see any thing 

I see in the same pillar these word when she who figure of all be the perfect and never to be measure always one yet never the same still inconstant yet never waver shall come and kiss Endymion in his sleep he shall then rise else never this be strange 

what see you else 

there come over my eye either a dark mist or upon the fountain a deep thickness for I can perceive nothing but how be I delude or what difficult nay impossible thing be this 

methinks it easy 

good father and how 

be not a circle of all figure the perfect 

yes 

and be not Cynthia of all circle the most absolute 

yes 

be it not impossible to measure she who still work by her influence never stand at one stay 

yes 

be she not always Cynthia yet seldom in the same bigness always waver in her wax or wane that our body may the better be govern our season the daily give their increase yet never to be remove from her course as long as the heaven continue they 

yes 

then who can it be but Cynthia who virtue be all divine must needs bring thing to pass that be miraculous go humble thyself to Cynthia tell she the success of which myself shall be a witness and this assure thyself that she that send to find mean for his safety will now work her cunning 

how fortunate be I if Cynthia be she that may do it 

how fond be thou if thou do not believe it 

I will hasten thither that I may entreat on my knee for succour and embrace in my arm my friend 

I will go with thou for unto Cynthia must I discover all my sorrow who also must work in i a contentment 

may I now know the cause 

that shall be as we walk and I doubt not but the strangeness of my tale will take away the tediousness of our journey 

let we go 

I follow 

I marvel Corsites give i so much liberty all the world know his charge to be so high and his nature to be most strange who have so ill entreat lady of great honour that he have not suffer they to look out of window much less to walk abroad it may be he be in love with i for Endymion hard heart Endymion except what be he that be not enamour of my beauty but what respect thou the love of all the world Endymion hate thou alas poor Endymion my malice have exceed my love and thy faith to Cynthia quench my affection quench Tellus nay kindle they afresh in so much that I find scorch flame for dead ember and cruel encounter of war in my thought in steed of sweet parlay ah that I may once again see Endymion accurse girl what hope have thou to see Endymion on who head already be grow grey hair and who life must yield to nature before Cynthia end her displeasure wicked Dipsas and most devilish tellus the one for cunning too exquisite the other for hate too intolerable thou be command to weave the story and poetry wherein be show both example and punishment of tattle tongue and thou have only embroider the sweet face of Endymion devise of love melancholy imagination and what not out of thy work that thou shall study to pick out of thy mind but here come Corsites I must seem yield and stout full of mildness yet temper with a majesty for if I be too flexible I shall give he more hope than I mean if too froward enjoy less liberty than I will love he I can and therefore will practise that which be most contrary to our sex to dissemble 

fair Tellus I perceive you rise with the lark and to yourself sing with the nightingale 

my lord I have no playfellow but fancy be bar of all company I must question with myself and make my thought my friend 

I will you will account my thought also your friend for they be such as be only busy in wonder at your beauty and wisdom and some such as have esteem your fortune too hard and diverse of that kind that offer to set you free if you will set they free 

there be no colour so contrary as white and black nor element so disagree as fire and water nor any thing so opposite as man thought and their word 

he that give Cassandra the gift of prophesy with the curse that speak she never so true she shall never be believe have I think poison the fortune of man that utter the extremity of their inward passion be always suspect of outward perjury 

well Corsites I will flatter myself and believe you what will you do to enjoy my love 

set all the lady of the castle free and make you the pleasure of my life more I can do less I will not 

these be great word and fit your call for captain must promise thing impossible but will you do one thing for all 

any thing sweet Tellus that be ready for all 

you know that on the lunary bank sleep Endymion 

I know it 

if you will remove he from that place by force and convey he into some obscure cave by policy I give you here the faith of a unspotted virgin that you only shall possess i as a lover and in spite of malice have i for a wife 

remove he Tellus yes Tellus he shall be remove and that so soon as thou shall as much commend my diligence as my force I go 

stay will yourself attempt it 

i Tellus as I will have none partaker of my sweet love so shall none be partner of my labour but I pray thou go at your best leisure for Cynthia begin to rise and if she discover our love we both perish for nothing please she but the fairness of virginity all thing must be not only without lust but without suspicion of lightness 

I will depart and go you to Endymion 

I fly tellus be of all man the most fortunate 

simple Corsites I have set thou about a task be but a man that the god themselves can perform for little do thou know how heavy his head lie how hard his fortune but such shift must woman have to deceive man and under colour of thing easy entreat that which be impossible otherwise we shall be cumber with importunity oath sigh letter and all implement of love which to one resolve to the contrary be most loathsome I will in and laugh with the other lady at Corsites sweat 

will thy master never awake 

no I think he sleep for a wager but how shall we spend the time sir Tophas be so far in love that he pine in his bed and come not abroad 

but here come epi in a pelt chafe 

a pox of all false proverb and be a proverb a page I will have he by the ear 

why be thou angry 

why you know it be say the tide tarry no man

a monstrous lie for I be tide two hour and tarry for one to unlose i 

alas poor epi 

poor no no you base conceit slave I be a most complete gentleman although I be in disgrace with sir Tophas 

be thou out with he 

ay because I can get he a lodging with Endymion he will fain take a nap for forty or fifty year 

a short sleep consider our long life 

be he still in love 

in love why he do nothing but make sonnet 

can thou remember any one of his poem 

ay this be one the beggar love that know not where to lodge at last within my heart when I sleep he creep I wake and so my fancy begin to fadge 

that be a very long verse 

why the other be short the first be call from the thumb to the little finger the second from the little finger to the elbow and some he have make to reach to the crown of his head and down again to the soul of his foot it be set to the tune of the black Saunce ratio est because Dipsas be a black saint 

very wise but pray thou epi how be thou complete and be from thy master what occupation will thou take 

no my heart I be a absolute Microcosmus a petty world of myself my library be my head for I have no other book but my brain my wardrobe on my back for I have no more apparel than be on my body my armoury at my finger end for I use no other artillery than my nail my treasure in my purse sie omnia mea mecum porto 

good

a brave resolution but how will thou spend thy time 

not in any melancholy sort for my exercise I will walk horse 

too bad 

why be it not say it be good walk when one have his horse in his hand 

worse and worse but how will thou live 

by angle oh it be a stately occupation to stand four hour in a cold morning and to have his nose bite with frost before his bait be mumble with a fish 

a rare attempt but will thou never travel 

yes in a western barge when with a good wind and lusty pug one may go ten mile in two day 

thou be excellent at thy choice but what pastime will thou use none 

yes the quick of all 

what dice 

no when I be in haste xxj game at chess to pass a few minute 

a life for a little lord and full of quickness 

tush let i alone but I must needs see if I can find where Endymion lie and then go to a certain fountain hard by where they say faithful lover shall have allthing they will ask if I can find out any of these ego et magister meus erimus in tuto I and my master shall be friend he be resolve to weep some three or four pailful to avoid the rheum of love that wamble in his stomach 

shall we never see thy master dare 

yes let we go now for to morrow Cynthia will be there 

I will go with you but how shall we see for the watch 

tush let i alone I will begin to they master God speed you

so methinks for they smell all of drink like a beggar beard 

but I pray sir may we see Endymion 

no we be command in Cynthia name that no man shall see he 

no man why we be but boy 

mass neighbour he say true for if I swear I will never drink my liquor by the quart and yet call for two pint I think with a safe conscience I may carouse both 

pithy and to the purpose 

tush tush neighbour take i with you 

this will grow hot 

let they alone 

if I say to my wife wife I will have no raisin in my pudding she put in currant small raisin be raisin and boy be man Even as my wife shall have put no raisin in my pudding so shall there no boy see Endymion 

learned 

let master constable speak I think he be the wise among you 

you know neighbour it be a a old say see child and fool speak true 

true 

well there you see the man be the fool because it be provide from the child 

good 

then say I neighbour that child must not see Endymion because child and fool speak true 

o wicked application 

scurvy bring about 

nay he say true and therefore till Cynthia have be here he shall not be uncover therefore away 

a watch quoth you a man may watch 7 year for a wise word and yet go without it their wit be all as rusty as their bill but come on Ma Const shall we have a song before we go Const with all my heart 

I be come in sight of the lunary bank without doubt Tellus dote upon i and cunning that I may not perceive her love she have set i to a task that be do before it be begin Endymion you must change your pillow and if you be not weary of sleep I will carry you where at ease you shall sleep your fill it be good that without more ceremony I take he least be espy I be entrap and so incur the displeasure of Cynthia who common set watch that Endymion have no wrong 
what now be your mastership so heavy or be you nail to the ground not stir one whit then use all thy force though he feel it and wake what stone still turn I think to earth with lie so long on the earth do not thou Corsites before Cynthia pull up a tree that forty year be fasten with root and wreathe in knot to the ground do not thou with main force pull open the iron gate which no ram or engine can move have my weak thought make brawnfallen my strong arm or be it the nature of love or the quintessence of the mind to breed numbness or litherness or I know not what languish in my joint and sinew be but the base string of my body or do the remembrance of Tellus so refine my spirit into a matter so subtle and divine that the other fleshy part can work while they muse rest thyself rest thyself nay rent thyself in piece Corsites and strive in spite of love fortune and nature to lift up this dull body heavy than dead and more senseless than death 
but what be these so fair fiend that cause my hair to stand upright and spirit to fall down hag out alas nymph I crave pardon ay i out what do I here 

you see Pythagoras what ridiculous opinion you hold and I doubt not but you be now of another mind 

madam I plain perceive that the perfection of your brightness have pierce through the thickness that cover my mind in so much that I be no less glad to be reform then ashamed to remember my grossness 

they be thrice fortunate that live in your palace where truth be not in colour but life virtue not in imagination but execution 

I have always study to have rather live virtue then paint god the body of truth than the tomb but let we walk to Endymion it may be it lie in your art to deliver he as for Eumenides I fear he be dead 

I have allege all the natural reason I can for such a long sleep 

I can do nothing till I see he 

coin Floscula I be sure you be glad that you shall behold Endymion 

I be bless if I may have he recover 

be you in love with his person 

no but with his virtue 

what say you Semele 

madam I dare say nothing for fear I offend 

belike you can speak except you be spiteful but as good be silent as saucy Panelion what punishment be fit for Semele in who speech and thought be only contempt and sourness 

I love not madam to give any judgement yet sith your highness command I think to commit her tongue close prisoner to her mouth 

agree Semele if thou speak this twelvemonth thou shall forfeit thy tongue behold Endymion alas poor gentleman have thou spend thy youth in sleep that once vow all to my service hollow eye grey hair wrinkle cheek and decay limb be it destiny or deceit that have bring this to pass if the first who can prevent thy wretched star if the latter I will I may know thy cruel enemy I favour thou Endymion for thy honour thy virtue thy affection but to bring thy thought within the compass of thy fortune I have seem strange that I may have thou stay and now be thy day end before my favour begin but who have we here be it not Corsites 

it be but more like a leopard than a man 

awake he how now Corsites what make you here How come you deform look on thy hand and than thou see the picture of thy face 

miserable wretch and accurse how be I delude madam I ask pardon for my offence and you see my fortune deserve pity 

speak on thy offence can deserve great punishment but see thou rehearse the truth else shall thou not find i as thou wish i 

madam as it be no offence to be in love be a man mortal so I hope can it be no shame to tell with who my lady be heavenly your majesty commit to my charge fair tellus who beauty in the same moment take my heart captive that I undertake to carry her body prisoner since that time have I find such combat in my thought between love and duty reverence and affection that I can neither endure the conflict nor hope for the conquest 

in love a thing far unfit the name of a captain and as I think the tough and unsmoothed nature of Corsites but forth 

feel this continual war I think rather by parley to yield then by certain danger to perish I unfold to Tellus the depth of my affection and frame my tongue to utter a sweet tale of love that be wont to sound nothing but threat of war Shee too fair to be true and too false for one so fair after a nice denial practise a notable deceit command i to remove Endymion from this Caban and carry he to some dark cave which I seek to accomplish find impossible and so by fairy or fiend have be thus handle 

how say you my lord be not Tellus always practise of some deceit in sooth Corsites thy face be now too foul for a lover and thy heart too fond for a soldier you may see when warrior become wantoness how their manner alter with their face be it not a shame Corsites that have live so long in mar his camp thou shall now be rock in Venus cradle do thou we be Cupid quiver at thy girdle and make lance of look well Corsites rouse thyself and be as thou have be and let Tellus who be make all of love melt herself in her own looseness 

madam I doubt not but to recover my former state for tellus beauty never wrought such love in my mind as now her deceit have despite and yet to be revenge of a woman be a thing than love itself more womanish 

these spot gentleman be to be wear out if you rub they over with this lunary so that in place where you receive this main you shall find a medicine 

I thank you for that the god bless i from love and these pretty lady that haunt this green 

Corsites I will Tellus see your amiable face 

how spiteful Semele laugh that dare not speak 

can you not stir Endymion with that double strength of you 

not so much as his finger with all my force 

Pythagoras and gyptes what think you of Endymion what reason be to be give what remedy 

madam it be impossible to yield reason for thing that happen not in compass of nature it be most certain that some strange enchantment have bind all his sense 

what say you gyptes 

with Pythagoras that it be enchantment and that so strange that no art can undo it for that heaviness argue a malice unremovable in the enchantress and that no power can end it till she die that do it or the heaven show some mean more than miraculous 

o Endymion can spite itself devise a mischief so monstrous as to make thou dead with life and live be altogether dead where other number their year their hour their minute and step to age by stair thou only haste thy year and time in a cluster be old before thou remember thou be young 

no more floscula pity do he no good I will any thing else may and I vow by the unspotted honour of a lady he shall not miss it but be this all Gyptes that be to be do 

all as yet it may be that either the enchantress shall die or else be discover if either happen I will then practise the utmost of my art in the mean season about this grove will I have a watch and the first live thing that touch Endymion to be take 

Corsites what say you will you undertake this

Eumenides have tell such strange tale as I may well wonder at they but never believe they 

the other old man what a sad speech use he that cause we almost all to weep Cynthia be so desirous to know the experiment of her own virtue and so willing to ease Endymion hard fortune that she no soon hear the discourse but she make herself in a readiness to try the event 

we will also see the event but whist here come Cynthia with all her train let we sneak in among they 

Eumenides it can sink into my head that I shall be signify by that sacred fountain for many thing be there in the world to which those word may be apply 

good madam vouchsafe but to try else shall I think myself most unhappy that I ask not my sweet mistress 

will you not yet tell i her name 

pardon i good madam for if Endymion awake he shall myself have swear never to reveal it 

well let we to Endymion I will not be so stately good Endymion not to stoop to do thou good and if thy liberty consist in a kiss from i thou shall have it and although my mouth have be here tofore as untouched as my thought yet now to recover thy life though to restore thy youth it be impossible I will do that to Endymion which yet never mortal man can boast of heretofore nor shall ever hope for hereafter 

madam he begin to stir 

soft Eumenides stand still 

ah I see his eye almost open 

I command thou once again stir not I will stand behind he 

what do I see Endymion almost awake 

Endymion Endymion be thou deaf or dumb or have this long sleep take away thy memory ah my sweet Eudimion see thou not Eumenides thy faithful friend thy faithful Eumenides who for thy safety have be careless of his own content speak Endymion Endymion Endymion 

Endymion I call to mind such a name 

have thou forget thyself Endymion then do I not marvel thou remember not thy friend I tell thou thou be Endymion and I Eumenides behold also Cynthia by who favour thou be awake and by who virtue thou shall continue thy natural course 

Endymion speak sweet Endymion know thou not Cynthia 

o heaven who do I behold fair Cynthia divine Cynthia 

I be Cynthia and thou Endymion 

Endymion what do I here what a grey beard hollow eye wither body decay limb and all in one night 

one night thou have here sleep forty year by what enchantress as yet it be not know and behold the twig to which thou lay thy head be now become a tree call thou not Eumenides to remembrance 

thy name I do remember by the sound but thy favour I do not yet call to mind only divine Cynthia to who time fortune destiny and death be subject I see and remember and in all humility I regard and reverence 

you have good cause to remember Eumenides who have for thy safety forsake his own solace 

be I that Endymion who be wont in court to lead my life and in joust turney and arm to exercise my youth be I that Endymion 

thou be that Endymion and I Eumenides will thou not yet call i to remembrance 

ah sweet Eumenides I now perceive thou be he and that myself have the name of Endymion but that this shall be my body I doubt for how can my curl lock be turn to grey hair and my strong body to a die weakness have wax old and not know it 

well Endymion arise a while sit down for that thy limb be stiff and not able to stay thou and tell what have thou see in thy sleep all this while what dream vision thought and fortune for it be impossible but in so long time thou shall see thing strange 

fair Cynthia I will rehearse what I have see humble desire that when I exceed in length you give i warning that I may end for to utter all I have to speak will be troublesome although happy the strangeness may somewhat abate the tediousness 

well Endymion begin 

methinks I see a lady pass fair but very mischievous who in the one hand carry a knife with which she offer to cut my throat and in the other a lookingglass wherein see how ill anger become lady she refrain from intend violence she be accompany with other damsel one of which with a stern countenance and as it be with a settle malice engrave in her eye provoke she to execute mischief another with visage sad and constant only in sorrow with her arm cross and watery eye seem to lament my fortune but dare not offer to prevent the force I start in my sleep feel my very vein to swell and my sinew to stretch with fear and such a cold sweat bedew all my body that death itself can not be so terrible as the vision 

a strange sight Gyptes at our better leisure shall expound it 

after long debate with herself mercy overcome anger and there appear in her heavenly face such a divine majesty mingle with a sweet mildness that I be ravish with the sight above measure and wish that I may have enjoy the sight without end and so she depart with the other lady of which the one retain still a unmoveable cruelty the other a constant pity 

poor Endymion how be thou affright what else 

after she immediate appear a age man with a beard as white as snow cry in his hand a book with three leaf and speak as I remember these word Endymion receive this book with three leaf in which be contain counsel policy and picture and with that he offer i the book which I reject wherewith move with a disdainful pity he rend the first leaf in a thousand shiver the second time he offer it which I refuse also at which bend his brow and pitch his eye fast to the ground as though they be fix to the earth and not again to be remove then sudden cast they up to the heaven he tear in a rage the second leaf and offer the book only with one leaf I know not whether fear to offend or desire to know some strange thing move i I take the book and so the old man vanish 

what do thou imagine be in the last leaf 

there I portray to life with a cold quake in every joint I behold many wolf bark at thou Cynthia who have grind their tooth to bite do with strive bleed themselves to death there may I see ingratitude with a hundred eye gaze for benefit and with a thousand tooth gnaw on the bowel wherein she be breed treachery stand all clothe in white with a smile countenance but both her hand bathe in blood envy with a pale and meager face who body be so lean that one may tell all her bone and who garment be so totter that it be easy to number every thread stand shoot at star who dart fall down again on her own face there may I behold drone or beetle I know not how to term they creep under the wing of a princely eagle who be carry into her nest seek there to suck that vein that will have kill the eagle I muse that thing so base shall attempt a fact so barbarous or dare imagine a thing so bloody and many other thing madam the repetition whereof may at your better leisure seem more please for bee surfeit sometime with honey and the god be glut with harmony and your highness may be dull with delight 

I be content to be diet therefore let we in Eumenides see that Endymion be well tend lest either eat immoderate or sleep again too long he fall into a deadly surfeit or into his former sleep 
see this also be proclaim that whosoever will discover this practice shall have of Cynthia infinite thanks and no small reward 

ah Endymion none so joyful as Floscula of thy restore 

yes Floscula let Eumenides be somewhat glad and do not that wrong to the settle friendship of a man as to compare it with the light affection of a woman ah my dear friend Endymion suffer i to die with gaze at thou 

Eumenides thy friendship be immortal and not to be conceive and thy good will Floscula better than I have deserve but let we all wait on Cynthia I marvel Semele speak not a word 

because if she do she lose her tongue 

but how prosper your love 

I never yet speak word since your sleep 

I doubt not but your affection be old and your appetite cold 

no Endymion thou have make it strong and now be my spark grow to flame and my fancy almost to frenzy but let we follow and within we will debate all this matter at large 

epi love have justle my liberty from the wall and take the upper hand of my reason 

let i then trip up the heel of your affection and thrust your goodwill into the gutter 

no epi love be a lord of misrule and keep Christmas in my corpse 

no doubt there be good cheer what dish of delight do his lordship feast you withal 

first with a great platter of plumporridge of pleasure wherein be stew the mutton of mistrust 

excellent love lap 

then come a pie of patience a hen of honey a goose of gall a capon of care and many other viand some sweet and some sour which prove love to be as it be say of in old year dulce venenum 

a brave banquet 

but epi I pray there feel on my chin some thing prick i what do thou feel or see 

there be three or four little hair 

I pray thou call it my beard how shall I be trouble when this young spring shall grow to a great wood 

o sir your chin be but a quiller yet you will be most majestical when it be full fledge but I marvel that you love Dipsas that old crone 

agnosco veteris vestigia flammae I love the smoke of a old fire 

why she be so cold that no fire can be her thought 

it be a old goose epi that will eat no oat old cow will kick old rat gnaw cheese and old sack will have much patch I prefer a old coney before a rabbit sucker and a ancient hen before a young chicken peeper 

argumentum ab antiquitate my master love antic work 

give i a pippin that be wither like a old wife 

good sir 

then a contrario sequitur argumentum give i a wife that look like a old pippin 

nothing have make my master a fool but flat scholarship 

know thou not that old wine be best 

yes 

and thou know that like will to like 

I 

and thou know that Venus love the best wine 

So 

then I conclude that Venus be a old woman in a old cup of wine for est Venus in vinis ignis in igne fuit 

o lepidum caput oh mad cap master you be worthy to win Dipsas be she as old again for in your love you have wear the nap of your wit quite off and make it threadbare but soft who come here 

my solicitor 

all hail sir Tophas how feel you yourself 

stately in every joint which the common people term stiffness do Dipsas stoop will she yield will she bend 

o sir as much as you will wish for her chin almost touch her knee 

master she be bend I warrant you 

what condition do she ask 

she have vow she will never love any that have not a tooth in his head less than she 

how many have she 

one 

that go hard master for then you must have none 

a small request and agreeable to the gravity of her year what shall a wise man do with his mouth full of bone like a channel house the turtle true have never a tooth 

thy master be in a notable vain that will lose his tooth to be like a turtle 

let he lose his tongue to I care not 

nay you must also have no nail for she long since have cast she 

that I yield to what a quiet life shall Dipsas and I lead when we can neither bite nor scratch you may see youth how age provide for peace 

how shall we do to make he leave his love for we never speak to she 

let i alone Shee be a notable witch and have turn her maid Bagoa to a aspen tree for betray she secret 

I honour she for her cunning for now when I be weary of walk on two leg what a pleasure may she do i to turn i to some goodly ass and help i to four 

nay then I must tell you the troth her husband Geron be come home who this fifty year have have her to wife 

what do I hear have she a husband go to the sixteen and tell he desire be dead and will he to dig his grave o heaven a husband what death be agreeable to my fortune 

be not desperate and we will help you to find a young lady 

I love no grissel they be so brittle they will crack like glass or so dainty that if they be touch they be straight of the fashion of wax animus maioribus instat I desire old matron what a sight will it be to embrace one who hair be as orient as the pearl who tooth shall be so pure a watchet that they shall stain the true turquis who nose shall throw more beam from it then the fiery carbuncle who eye shall be environ about with redness exceed the deep coral and who lip may compare with silver for the paleness such a one if you can help i to I will by piecemeal curtal my affection towards Dipsas and walk my swell thought till they be cold 

wise provide How say you my friend will you angle for my master cause 

most willing 

if we speed he not short I will burn my cap we will serve he of the spade and dig a old wife out of the grave that shall be answerable to his gravity 

youth adieu he that bring i first news shall possess my inheritance 

what be thy master land 

know you not that my master be libre tenens Samias what be that 

a freeholder but I will after he 

and we to hear what news of Endymion for the conclusion 

who will have think that Tellus be so fair by nature so honourable by birth so wise by education will have enter into a mischief to the god so odious to man so detestable and to her friend so malicious 

if Bagoa have not bewray it how then shall it have come to light but we see that gold and fair word be of force to corrupt the strong man and therefore able to work silly woman like wax 

I marvel what Cynthia will determine in this cause 

I fear as in all cause hear of it in justice and then judge of it in mercy for how can it be that she that be unwilling to punish her deadly foe with disgrace will revenge injury of her train with death 

that old witch Dipsas in a rage have understand she practise to be discover turn poor Bagoa to a aspen tree but let we make haste and bring tellus before Cynthia for she be come out after we 

let we go 

Dipsas thy year be not so many as thy vice yet more in number then common nature do afford or justice shall permit have thou almost these fifty year practise that detest wickedness of witchcraft be thou so simple as for to know the nature of simple of all creature to be most sinful 
thou have threaten to turn my course awry and alter by thy damnable art the government that I now possess by the eternal god but know thou Dipsas and let all the enchanter know that Cynthia be place for light on earth be also protect by the power of heaven breath out thou may word gather thou may herb find out thou may stone agreeable to thy art yet of no force to appall my heart in which courage be so root and constant persuasion of the mercy of the god so ground that all thy witchcraft I esteem as weak as the world do thy case wretched 
this noble gentleman Geron once thy husband but now thy mortal hate do thou procure to live in a desert almost desperate Endymion the flower of my court and the hope of succeed time have thou bewitch by art before thou will suffer he to flourish by nature 

madam thing past may be repent not recall there be nothing so wicked that I have not do nor any thing so wish for as death yet among all the thing that I commit there be nothing so much torment my rent and ransack thought as that in the prime of my husband youth I divorce he by my devilish art for which if to die may be amends I will not live till to morrow if to live and still be more miserable will better content he I will wish of all creature to be old and ugly 

Dipsas thou have make this difference between i and Endymion that be both young thou have cause i to wake in melancholy lose the joy of my youth and he to sleep not remember youth 

stay here come Tellus we shall now know all 

I will to Cynthia thou can make as good a excuse in truth as to i thou have do by wit 

truth shall be my answer and therefore I will not study for a excuse 

be it possible tellus that so few year shall harbour so many mischief thy swell pride have I bear because it be a thing that beauty make blameless which the more it exceed fairness in measure the more it stretch itself in disdain thy devise against Corsites I smile at for that wit the sharp they be the shrewd they be but this unacquainted and most unnatural practice with a vile enchantress against so noble a gentleman as Endymion I abhor as a thing most malicious and will revenge as a deed most monstrous 
and as for you Dipsas I will send you into the desert among wild beast and try whether you can cast lion tiger boar and bear into as dead asleep as you do Endymion or turn they to tree as you have do Bagoa but tell i Tellus what be the cause of this cruel part far unfitting thy sex in which nothing shall be but simpleness and much disagree from thy face in which nothing seem to be but softness 

divine Cynthia by who I receive my life and be content to end it I can neither excuse my fault without lie nor confess it without shame yet be it possible that in so heavenly thought as you there can fall such earthly motion as i I will then hope if not to be pardon without extreme punishment yet to be hear without great marvel 

Say on tellus I can imagine any thing that can colour such a cruelty 

Endymion that Endymion in the prime of his youth so ravish my heart with love that to obtain my desire I can not find mean nor to recite they reason 
what be she that favour not Endymion be young wise honourable and virtuous beside what mettle be she make of be she mortal that be not affect with the spice nay infect with the poison of that not to be express yet always to be feel love which break the brain and never bruise the brow consume the heart and never touch the skin and make a deep scar to be see before any wound at all be feel my heart too tender to withstand such a divine fury yield to love madam I not without blush confess yield to love 

a strange effect of love to work such a extreme hate How say you Endymion all this be for love 

I say madam then the god send i a woman hate 

that be as bad for then by contrary you shall never sleep but on tellus let we hear the end 

feel a continual burn in all my bowel and a burst almost in every vain I can not smother the inward fire but it must needs be perceive by the outward smoke and by the fly abroad of diverse spark diverse judge of my scald flame 
Endymion as full of art as wit mark my eye in which he may see almost his own my sigh by which he may ever hear his name sound aim at my heart in which he be assure his person be imprint and by question wring out that which be ready to burst out when he see the depth of my affection he swear that my in respect of he be as fume to Aetna valley to Alps ant to eagle and nothing can be compare to my beauty but his love and eternity thus draw a smooth shoe upon a crooked foot he make i believe that which all of our sex willing acknowledge I be beautiful and to wonder which indeed be a thing miraculous that any of his sex shall be faithful 

Endymion how will you clear yourself 

madam by my own accuser 

Well tellus proceed but brief least take delight in utter thy love thou offend we with the length of it 

I will madam quick make a end of my love and my tale find continual increase of my torment thought and that the enjoy of my love make deep wound then the enter into it I can find no mean to ease my grief but to follow Endymion and continual to have he in the object of my eye who have i slave and subject to his love 
but in the moment that I fear his falsehood and fry myself most in my affection I find ah grief even than I lose myself I find he in most melancholy and desperate term curse his star his state the earth the heaven the world and all for the love of 

of who Tellus speak bold 

madam I dare not utter for fear to offend 

speak I say who dare take offence if thou be command by Cynthia 

for the love of Cynthia 

for my love Tellus that be strange Endymion be it true 

in all thing madam Tellus do not speak false 

what will this breed to in the end well Endymion we shall hear all 

I see my hope turn to mishap and a settle dissemble towards i and a unmoveable desire to Cynthia forget both myself and my sex fall unto this unnatural hate for know your virtue Cynthia to be immortal I can not have a imagination to withdraw he And find my own affection unquenchable I can not carry the mind that any else shall possess what I have pursue for though in majesty beauty virtue and dignity I always humble and yield myself to Cynthia yet in affection I esteem myself equal with the goddess and all other creature accord to their state with myself for star to their bigness have their light and the sun have no more and little pytcher when they can hold no more be as full as great vessel that run over thus madam in all truth have I utter the unhappiness of my love and the cause of my hate yield whole to that divine judgement which never err for want of wisdom or envy for too much partiality 

How say you my lord to this matter but what say you Endymion have Tellus tell troth 

madam in all thing but in that she say I love she and swear to honour she 

be there such a time whenas for my love thou do vow thyself to death and in respect of it loathe thy life speak Endymion I will not revenge it with hate 

the time be madam and be and ever shall be that I honour your highness above all the world but to stretch it so far as to call it love I never dare there have none please my eye but Cynthia none delight my ear but Cynthia none possess my heart but Cynthia I have forsake all other fortune to follow Cynthia and here I stand ready to die if it please Cynthia such a difference have the god set between our state that all must be duty loyalty and reverence nothing without it vouchsafe your highness be term love my unspotted thought my languish body my discontent life let they obtain by princely favour that which to challenge they must not presume only wish of impossibility with imagination of which I will spend my spirit and to myself that no creature may hear soft call it love and if any urge to utter what I whisper then will I name it honour from this sweet contemplation if I be not drive I shall live of all man the most content take more pleasure in my age thought then ever I do in my youthful action 

Endymion this honourable respect of thou shall be christen love in thou and my reward for it favour persevere Endymion in love i and I account more strength in a true heart then in a wall city I have labour to win all and study to keep such as I have win but those that neither my favour can move to continue constant nor my offer benefit get to be faithful the god shall either reduce to truth or revenge their treachery with justice Endymion continue as thou have begin and thou shall find that Cynthia shine not on thou in vain 

your highness have bless i and your word have again restore my youth methinks I feel my joint strong and these mouldy hair to moult and all by your virtue Cynthia into who hand the balance that weigh time and fortune be commit 

what young again than it be pity to punish Tellus 

ah Endymion now I know thou and ask pardon of thou suffer i still to wish thou well 

Tellus Cynthia must command what she will 

Endymion I rejoice to see thou in thy former estate 

good Floscula to thou also be I in my former affection 

Endymion the comfort of my life how be I ravish with a joy matchless save only the enjoy of my mistress 

Endymion you must now tell who Eumenides shrine for his saint 

Semele madam 

Semele Eumenides be it Semele the very wasp of all woman who tongue sting as much as a adder tooth 

it be Semele Cynthia the possess of who love must only prolong my life

humble thank madam now only do I begin to live 

a hard choice madam either to be marry if I say nothing or to lose my tongue if I speak a word yet do I rather choose to have my tongue cut out than my heart distemper I will not have he 

speak the parrot she shall nod hereafter with sign cut off her tongue nay her head that have a servant of honourable birth honest manner 〈◊〉 true love will not be persuade 

he be no faithful I  or then will he have ask his mistress 

have he not be faithful he have never see into the fountain and so lose his friend and mistress 

thy own thought sweet Semele witness against thy word for what have thou find in my life but love and as yet what have I find in my love but bitterness madam pardon Semele and let my tongue ransom she 

thy tongue Eumenides what shall thou live want a tongue to blaze the beauty of Semele well Semele I will not command love for it can be enforce let i entreat it 

I be content your highness shall command for now only do I think Eumenides faithful that be willing to lose his tongue for my sake yet loath because it shall do i better service madam I accept of Eumenides 

I thank you Semele 

ah happy Eumenides that have a friend so faithful and a mistress so fair with what sudden mischief will the god daunt this excess of joy sweet Semele I live or die as thou will 

what shall become of tellus Tellus you know Endymion be vow to a service from which death can remove he Corsites cast still a lovely look towards you how say you will have your Corsites and so receive pardon for all that be past 

madam most willing 

but I can tell whether Corsites be agree

then so much of Endymion as his picture come to possess and play withal 

ah my sweet Tellus my love shall be as thy beauty be matchless 

now it rest Dipsas that if thou will forswear that vile art of enchant Geron have promise again to receive thou otherwise if thou be wed to that wickedness I must and will see it punish to the uttermost 

madam I renounce both substance and shadow of that most horrible and hateful trade vow to the god continual penance and to your highness obedience 

how say you Geron will you admit she to your wife 

I with more joy than I do the first day for nothing can happen to make i happy but only she forsake that lewd and detestable course Dipsas I embrace thou 

and I thou Geron to who I will hereafter recite the cause of these my first folly 

well Endymion nothing rest now but that we depart thou have my favour tellus she friend Eumenides in paradise with his Semele Geron content with Dipsas 

nay soft I can handsome go to bed without Bagoa 

well sir Tophas it may be there be more virtue in i than myself know of for Endymion I awake and at my word he wax young I will try whether I can turn this tree again to thy true love 

turn she to a true love or false so she be a wench I care not 

Bagoa Cynthia put a end to thy hard fortune for be turn to a tree for reveal a truth I will recover thou again if in my power be the effect of truth 

Bagoa a bots upon thou
