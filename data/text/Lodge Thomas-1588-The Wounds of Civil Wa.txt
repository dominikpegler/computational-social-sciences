grave senator and father of this state 
our strange protraction and unkind delay 
where weighty war do call we out to fight 
our factious wit to please aspire lord 
you see have add power unto our foe 
and hazard rich Phrigia and Bithynia 
with all our asian hold and city too 
thus Sulla seek to be general 
who be invest in our consul pall 
have force murder in a quiet state 
the cause whereof even Pompey may complain 
who seek to advance a climb friend 
have lose by death a sweet and courteous son 
who now in Asia but Mithridates 
laugh at these fond dissension I complain 
while we in wrangle for a general 
forsake our friend forestall our forward war 
and leave our legion full of dalliance 
wait our idle will at Capua 
fie roman shall the glory of your name 
the wondrous beauty of this Capitol 
perish through Sulla insolence and pride 
as if that Rome be rob of true renown 
and destitute of warlike champion now 
Loe here the man the rumor of who fame 
have make Hiberia tremble and submit 
see Marius that in manage estate 
through many care and trouble he have pass 
and spend his youth upon who reverend head 
the milkwhite pledge of wisdom sweet spread 
he six time consul fit for peace or war 
sit droop here content to brook disgrace 
who glad to fight through folly of his foe 
sigh for your shame while you abide secure 
and I that see and shall recure these wrong 
through Pompey late vacation and delay 
have leave to publish he for general 
that merit better title far than these 
but noble now the final day be come 
when I your tribune study for renown 
pronounce and publish Marius general 
to lead our legion against Mithridates 
and crave grave father sign of your content 

believe i noble roman and grave senator 
this strange election and this new make law 
will witness our unstable government 
and dispossess Rome of her empery 
for although Marius be renown in arm 
famous for prowess and grave in warlike drift 
yet may the sunshine of his former deed 
nothing eclipse our Sulla dignity 
by lot and by election he be make 
chief general against Mithridates 
and shall we then abridge he of that rule 
it be injury to Sulla and to Rome 
nor will the height of his all dare mind 
brook to the death so vile and foul disgrace 

why Pompey as if the senate have not power 
to appoint dispose and change their general 
Rome shall belike be bind to Sulla rule 
who haughty pride and swell thought puff up 
foreshow the reach to proud Tarquin state 
be not his linger to our roman loss 
at Capua where he brave it out with feast 
make know think you unto the senate here 
yes Pompey yes and hereof be we sure 
if roman state on Sulla pride shall lie 
Rome conquest will to Pontus region fly 
therefore grave and renown senator 
pillar that bear and hold our rule aloft 
you stately true and rich pyramid 
descend into the depth of your estate 
then shall you find that Sulla be more fit 
to rule in Rome domestical affair 
then have the conquest of Bithynia 
which if once get he will but by death forgo 
therefore I say Marius our general 

Lo thus we strive abroad to win renown 
and nought regard at home our wane state 
Brutus I say the many brave exploit 
the warlike act that Sulla have achieve 
show he a soldier and a roman too 
who care be more for country than himself 
Sulla will brook that in so many war 
so hard adventure and so strange extreme 
have bear the palm and prize of victory 
thus with dishonour to give up his charge 
Sulla have friend and soldier at command 
that first will make the tower of Rome to shake 
and force the stately Capitol to dance 
year any rob he of his just renown 
then we that through the caspian shore have run 
and spread with ship the oriental sea 
at home shall make a murder of our friend 
and massacre our dear countryman 

the power of Sulla nought will veil against Rome 
and let i die Lucretius ere I see 
our senate dread for any private man 
therefore renown Sulpitius send for Sulla back 
let Marius lead our man in Asia 

the law the senate whole do affirm 
let Marius lead our man in Asia 

Cynna affirm the senate censure just 
and say let Marius lead the legion forth 

honour and victory follow Marius step 
for he do Granius wish to fight for Rome 

why then you sage and ancient sire of Rome 
Sulpitius here again do publish forth 
that Marius by the senate here be make 
chief general to lead the legion out 
against Mithridates and his competitor 
now victory for honour of Rome follow Marius 

Sage and imperial senator of Rome 
not without good advisement have you see 
old Marius silent during your discourse 
yet not for that he fear to plead his cause 
or raise his honour tread down by age 
but that his word shall not allure his friend 
to stand on strict term for his behoof 
six time the senate by election have 
make Marius consul over warlike Rome 
and in that space nor Rome nor all the world 
can ever say that Marius be untrue 
these silver hair that hang upon my face 
be witness of my unfeigned zeal 
the cymbrian that erewhile invade France 
and hold the roman empire in disdain 
lay all confound under Marius sword 
fierce Scipio the mirror once of Rome 
who loss as yet my inward soul bewail 
be ask who shall succeed and bear his rule 
even this quoth he shall Scipio armour bear 
and therewithal clap i upon the back 
if then grave lord my former pass youth 
be spend in bring honour into Rome 
let then my age and latter date of year 
be seal up for honour unto Rome 

Sulla what mean these arm and warlike troop 
these glorious ensign and these fierce alarm 
it be proud do to brave the Capitol 

these arm Sulpitius be not bear for hate 
but maintenance of my confirm state 
I come to Rome with no seditious thought 
except I find too froward injury 

but wisdom will you do forbear 
to yield these flight suspicion of contempt 
where as this senate study high affair 

what serious matter have these lord in hand 

the senator with full decree appoint 
old Marius for their captain general 
to lead thy legion into Asia 
and fight against the fierce Mithridates 

to Marius jolly stuff why then I see 
your lordship mean to make a babe of i 

it be true Sulla the senate have agree 
that Marius shall those band and legion bear 
which you now hold against Mithridates 

Marius shall lead they then if Sulla say not no 
and I shall bea consul shadow then 
trustless senator and ingrateful roman 
for all the honour I have do to Rome 
for all the spoil I bring within her wall 
thereby for to enrich and raise her pride 
repay you i with this ingratitude 
you know unkind that Sulla wound helm 
be never hang up or once distain with rust 
the Marcian that before i fall amain 
and like to winter hail on every side 
unto the city Nuba I pursue 
and for your sake be thirty thousand slay 
the hippinian and the Samnite Sulla bring 
as tributary unto famous Rome 
ay where do Sulla ever draw his sword 
or lift his warlike hand above his head 
for roman cause but he be conqueror 
and now unthankful seek you to disgrade 
and tear the plume that Sulla sword have win 
Marius I tell thou Sulla be the man 
disdain to stoop or vail his pride to thou 
Marius I say thou may nor shall not have 
the charge that unto Sulla do belong 
unless thy sword can tear it from my heart 
which in a thousand fold impale the same 

and Sulla hereof be thou full assure 
the honour whereto my undaunted mind 
and this grave senate have enhance i 
thou nor thy follower shall derogate 
the expense of year that Marius have overpass 
in foreign broil and civil mutiny 
have teach he this that one unbridle foe 
my former fortune never shall overgo 

Marius I smile at these thy foolish word 
and credit i shall laugh outright I fear 
if that I know not how thy froward age 
do make thy sense as feeble as thy joint 

Sulla Scylla Marius year have teach 
he how to pluck so proud a younker plume 
and know these hair that dangle down my face 
in brightness like the silver Rhodope 
shall add so haughty courage to my mind 
and rest such pierce object against thy eye 
that mask in folly age shall force thou stoop 

and by my hand I swear ere thou shall maze i so 
my soul shall perish but I will have thy beard 
say grave senator shall Scylla be your general 

no the senate I and Rome herself agree 
there be none but Marius shall be general 
therefore Scylla these dare term unfit 
beseem not thou before the Capitol 

beseem not i senator advise you 
Scylla have vow who vow the heaven record 
who oath have pierce and search the deep vast 
I and who protestation reign on earth 
this Capitol wherein your glory shine 
be never so press and throng thou with scarlet gown 
as Rome shall be with heap of slaughter soul 
before that Scylla yield his title up 
I will mate her street that peer into the cloud 
burnish with gold and ivory pillar fair 
shine with jasper jet and ebony 
all like the palace of the morning sun 
to swim within a sea of purple blood 
before I lose the name of general 

these threat against thy country and these lord 
Scylla proceed from forth a Traitor heart 
who head I trust to see advance up 
on high top of all this Capitol 
as erst be many of thy progeny 
before thou vaunt thy victory in Rome 

graybeard if so thy heart and tongue agree 
draw forth thy legion and thy man at arm 
rear up thy standard and thy steel crest 
and meet with Scylla in the field of Mars 
and try who fortune make he general 

I take thy word Marius will meet thou there 
and prove thou Scylla a traitor unto Rome 
and all that march under thy traitorous wing 
therefore they that love the senate and Marius 
now follow he 

and all that love Scylla come down to he 
for the rest let they follow Marius 
and the devil himself be their captain 

Scylla I come to thou 

Scylla Lucretius will die with thou 

thank my noble lord of Rome 

stay Scylla hear Anthony breath forth 
the plead plaint of sad decline Rome 

Anthony thou know thy honey word do pierce 
and move the mind of Scylla to remorse 
yet neither word nor plead now must serve 
whenas my honour call i forth to fight 
therefore sweet Anthony be short for Sulla haste 

for Sulla haste oh whither will thou fly 
tell i my Scylla what do thou take in hand 
what war be these thou stir up in Rome 
what fire be this be kindle by thy wrath 
a fire that must be quench by roman blood 
a war that will confound our empery 
and last a act of foul impiety 
Brutus beast will break the mutual law of love 
and bird affection will not violate 
the senseless tree have concord among themselves 
and stone agree in link of amity 
if they my Scylla brook not to have jar 
what then be man that against themselves do war 
thou will say my Scylla honour stir thou up 
be it honour to infringe the law of Rome 
thou will say perhaps the title thou have win 
it be dishonour for thou to forgo 
oh be there any height above the high 
or any better than the best of all 
be thou not consul be thou not lord of Rome 
what great title shall our Scylla have 
but thou will hence thou will fight with Marius 
the man the senate I and Rome have choose 
think this before thou never lift aloft 
and let fall thy warlike hand down 
but thou do raze and wound thy city Rome 
and look how many slaughter soul he slay 
under thy ensign and thy conquer lance 
so many murder make thou of thyself 

enough my Anthony for thy honey tongue 
wash in a syrup of sweet conservative 
drive confuse thought through Sulla mind 
therefore suffice thou I may nor will not hear 
so farewell Anthony honour call i hence 
Scylla will fight for glory and for Rome 

see noble Anthony the trustless state of rule 
the stall hold of matchless sovereignty 
now fortune bear Rome into the cloud 
to throw she down into the low hell 
for they that spread her glory through the world 
be they that tear her proud triumphant plume 
the heartburning pride of proud Tarquinius 
root from Rome the sway of kingly mace 
and now this discord new set abroach 
shall ease our consul and our senate down 

unhappy Rome and roman thrice accurse 
that oft with triumph fill your city wall 
with king and conquer ruler of the world 
now to eclipse in top of all thy pride 
through civil discord and domestic broil 
oh roman weep the tear of sad lament 
and rent your sacred robe at this exchange 
for fortune make our Rome a band ball 
toss from her hand to take the great fall 

o whence proceed these foul ambitious thought 
that fire man heart and make they thirst for rule 
have sovereignty so much be witch the mind 
of roman that their former busy care 
which erst do tire in seek city good 
must now be change to ruin of her wall 
must they that rear her stately temple up 
deface the sacred place of their god 
then may we wail and wring our wretched hand 
sith both our god our temple and our wall 
ambition make fell fortune spiteful thrall exit all 

why whither fly you roman 
what mischief make this flight 
stay good my friend stay dear countryman

what will you leave your chieftain roman there 
and lose your honour in the gate of Rome 
what shall our country see and Scylla rue 
these coward thought so fix and firm in you 
what be you come from Capua to proclaim 
your heartless treason in this happy town 
what will you stand and gaze with shameless look 
while Marius butcher knife assail our throat 
be you the man the hope the stair of state 
be you the soldier press for Asia 
be you the wonder legion of the world 
and will you fly these shadow of resist 
well roman I will perish through your pride 
that think by you to have return in pomp 
and at the least your general shall prove 
even in his death your treason and his love 
Lo this the wreath that shall my body bind 
while Scylla sleep with honour in the field 
and I alone within these colour shut 
will blush your dastard folly in my death 
so farewell heartless soldier and untrue 
that leave your Scylla who have love you Exit 

why fellow soldier shall we fly the field 
and careless forsake our general 
what shall our vow conclude with no avail 
first die sweet friend and shed your purple blood 
before you lose the man that will you good 
then to it brave italian out of hand 
Scylla we come with fierce and deadly blow 
to venge thy wrong and vanquish all thy toe 

you roman soldier fellow mate in arm 
the blind fold mistress of incertain chance 
have turn these traitorous chimer from the top 
and seat Scylla in the chief place 
the place beseem Scylla and his mind 
for be the throne where matchless glory sit 
empale with fury threaten blood and death 
begird with famine and those fatal fear 
that dwell below amid the dreadful vast 
tut Sulla sparkle eye shall dim with clear 
the burn brand of their consume light 
and master fancy with a forward mind 
and mask repine fear with awful power 
for man of base mettle and conceit 
can conceive the beauty of my thought 
I crown with a wreath of warlike state 
imagine thought more great than a crown 
and yet befit well a roman mind 
then gentle minister of all my hope 
that with your sword make way unto my wish 
harken the fruit of your courageous fight 
in spite of all these roman basilisk 
that seek to quell we with their currish look 
we will to Pontus we will have gold my heart 
those oriental pearl shall deck our brow 
and you my gentle friend you roman peer 
kind Pompey worthy of a consul name 
you shall abide the father of the state 
while these brave lad Lucretius and I 
in spite of all these brawl senator 
will shall and dare attempt on Asia 
and drive Mithridates from out his door 

i Scylla these be word of much worth 
fit for the master of so great a mind 
now Rome must stoop for Marius and his friend 
have leave their arm and trust unto their heel 

but Pompey if our spanish jennet foot 
have learn to post it of their mother wind 
I hope to nip upon the grey beard heel 
till I have crop his shoulder from his head 
as for his son the proud aspire boy 
his beardless face and wanton smile brow 
shall if I catch he deck yond Capitol 
the father son the friend and soldier all 
that fawn on Marius shall with fury fall 

and what event shall all these trouble bring 

This Scylla in fortune will exceed a king 
but friend and soldier with disperse band 
go seek out Marius fond confederate 
some post along those unfrequented path 
that track by nook unto the neighbour sea 
murder i Marius and maintain my life 
and that his favorite in Rome may learn 
the difference betwixt my fawn and frown 
go cut they short and shed their hateful blood Ex Soul 
to quench these fury of my froward mood 

Loe Scylla where our senator approach 
perhaps to gratulate thy good success 

I that perhaps be fit place there 
but my Lucretius these be cunning lord 
who tongue be tip with honey to deceive 
as for their heart if outward eye may see they 
the devil scarce with mischief may agree they 

good fortune to our consul worthy Scylla 

and why not general against the king of Pontus 

and general against the king of Pontus 

sirrah your word be good your thought be ill 
each milk white hair amid this mince beard 
compare with million of thy treacherous thought 
will change their hue through vigour of thy hate 
but do not pity make my fury thrall 
this sword shall finish hate thy life and all 
I pray thou Granius how do Marius 

as he that bide a thrall to thou and fate 
live in hope as I and other do 
to catch good fortune and to cross thou too 

both blunt and bold but too much mother wit 
to play with fire where fury stream about 
curtail your tale fond man cut of the rest 
but here I will dissemble for the best 

Scylla my year have teach i to discern 
betwixt ambitious pride and princely zeal 
and from thy youth these peer of Rome have mark 
a rash revenge hammer in thy brain 
thy tongue adorn with flow eloquence 
and yet I see imprint in thy brow 
a fortunate but froward governance 
and though thy rival Marius mate late 
by backward work of his wretched fate 
be fall yet Scylla mark what I have see 
even here in Rome the fencer Spectacus 
have be as fortunate as thou thyself 
but when that Crassus sword assay his crest 
the fear of death do make he droop for woe 

you see in Rome this brawl fencer die 
when Spectacus by Crassus be subdue 
why so but sir I hope you will apply 
and say like Spectacus that I shall die 
thus peevish eld discourse by a fire 
amid their cup will prate how man aspire 
be this the greeting roman that you give 
unto the patron of your monarchy 
Lucretius shall I play a pretty jest 

what Scylla will what roman dare withstand 

a brief and please answer by my head 
why tell i Granius do thou talk in sport 

no Scylla my discourse be resolute 
not coin to please thy fond and curse thought 
for be my tongue betray with please word 
to feed the humour of thy haughty mind 
I rather wish the rot shall root it out 

the brave brawler that I ever hear 
but soldier since I see he be oppress 
with crooked choler and our artist teach 
that fret blood will press through open vein 
let he that have the keen sword arrest 
the graybeard and cut off his head in jest 
soldier lay hand on Granius 

be this the guerdon then of good advice 

no but the mean to make fond man more wise 
tut I have wit and carry warlike tool 
to charm the scold prate of wanton fool 
tell i of fencer and a tale of fate 
no Scylla think of nothing but a state 

why Scylla I be arm the worst to try 

I pray thou then Lucretius let he die 
beshrew i lord but in this jolly vain 
it be pity but the prate fool be slay 
I fear i Pluto will be wroth with i 
for to detain so grave a man as he 

but seek not Scylla in this quiet state 
to work revenge upon a age man 
a senator a sovereign of this town 

the more the cedar climb the soon down 
and do I think the proud man in Rome 
will winch at that which I have wrought or do 
I will and can control his insolence 
why senator be this the true reward 
wherewith you answer prince for their pain 
as when this sword have make our city free 
a brave mate shall thus distemper i 
but Lepidus and fellow senator 
I be resolve and will not brook your taunt 
who wrong Scylla let he look for stripe 

ay but the mild passion show the man 
for as the leaf do beautify the tree 
the pleasant flower bedeck the paint spring 
even so in man of great reach and power 
a mild and piteous thought augment renown 
old Anthony do never see my lord 
a swell shower that do continue long 
a climb tower that do not taste the wind 
a wrathful man not waste with repent 
I speak of love my Scylla and of joy 
to see how fortune lend a pleasant gale 
unto the spread sail of thy desire 
and love thou must counsel thou withal 
for as by cut fruitful vine increase 
so faithful counsel work a prince peace 

thou honey talk father speak thy mind 

my Scylla scarce those tear be dry up 
that roman matron weep to see this war 
along the holy street the hideous groan 
of murder man infect the weep air 
thy foe be flee not overtake yet 
and doubtful be the hazard of this war 
yea doubtful be the hazard of this war 
for now our legion draw their wasteful sword 
to murder who Even roman citizen 
to conquer who Even roman citizen 
then if that Scylla love these citizen 
if care of Rome if threat of foreign foe 
if fruitful counsel of thy forward friend 
may take effect go fortunate and drive 
the king of Pontus out of Asia 
lest while we dream on civil mutiny 
our wary foe assail our city wall 

my long conceal thought mark Anthony 
must seek discovery through thy pliant word 
believe i Scylla civil mutiny 
must not obscure thy glory and our name 
then sith that factious Marius be suppress 
go spread thy colour amid the asian field 
meanwhile myself will watch this city weal 

Pompey I know thy love I mark thy word 
and Anthony thou have a please vain 
but senator I hammer in my head 
with every thought of honour some revenge 
speak what shall Scylla be your general 

we do decree that Scylla shall be general 

and wish you Sulla weal and honour too 

we wish both Sulla weal and honour too 

then take away the scandal of this state 
banish the name of tribune out of town 
proclaim false Marius and his other friend 
foe man and traitor to the state of Rome 
and I will wend and work so much by force 
as I will master false Mithridates 

the name of tribune have continue long 

so shall not Lepidus if he withstand i 
sirrah you see the head of Granius 
watch you his hap unless you change your word 
Pompey now please i Pompey grant my suit 

lictor proclaim this our undaunted doom 
we will that Marius and his wretched son 
his friend Sulpitius Claudius and the rest 
behold for traitor and acquit the man 
that shall endanger there unlucky line 
and henceforth tribune name and state shall cease 
grave senator how like you this decree 

Even as our consul wish so let it be 

then Lepidus all friend in faith for i 
so leave I Rome to Pompey and my friend 
resolve to manage those our asian war 
frolic brave soldier we must foot it now 
Lucretius you shall bide the brunt with i 
Pompey farewell and farewell Lepidus 
mark Anthony I leave thou to thy book 
study for Rome and Sulla royalty 
but by my sword I wrong this graybeard head 
go sirrah place it on the Capitol 
a just promotion fit for Sulla foe 
lording farewell come soldier let we go Exit 

Scylla farewell and happy be thy chance 
who war both Rome and roman must advance 

my lord the course of your unstaid fate 
make weak through that your late unhappy fight 
withdraw our will that fain will work your weal 
for long experience and the change of time 
the innocent suppression of the just 
in lean to forsake man relief 
do make we fear lest our unhappy town 
shall perish through the angry roman sword 

lord of Minturnum when I shape my course 
to fly the danger of pursue death 
I leave my friend and all alone attain 
in hope of succour to this little town 
rely on your courtesy and truth 
what foolish fear do then amaze you thus 

o Marius thou thyself thy son thy friend 
be banish and exile out of Rome 
proclaim for traitor rest of your estate 
adjudge to death with certain warrantise 
shall then so small a town my lord as this 
hazard their fortune to supply your want 

why citizen and what be Marius 
I tell you not so base as to despair 
yea able to withstand ingratitude 
tell i of foolish law decree at Rome 
to please the angry humour of my foe 
believe i lord I know and be assure 
that magnanimity can never fear 
and fortitude so conquer silly fate 
as Scylla when he hope to have my head 
may hap ere long on sudden lose his own 

a hope beseem Marius but I fear 
too strange to have a short and good event 

why sir Pausanius have not you behold 
Campania plain fulfil with great foe 
than be that wanton milksop nature scorn 
base mind man to live in perfect hope 
who thought be shut within your cottage eaves 
refuse not Marius that must favour you 
for these be part of unadvised man 
with present fear to lose a perfect friend 
that can will may control command subdue 
that brave boy that thus bewitch you 

how glad will we succour you my lord 
but that we fear 

what the moonshine in the water 
thou wretched stepdame of my fickle state 
be these the guerdon of the great mind 
to make they hope and yet betray their hap 
to make they climb to overthrow they straight 
accurse thy wreak thy wrath thy bale thy wheel 
that make i sigh the sorrow that I feel 
untrodden path my foot shall rather trace 
than wrest my succour from inconstant hand 
rebound rock shall rather ring my ruth 
than these campanian pile where terror bide 
and nature that have lift my throne so high 
shall witness Marius triumph if he die 
but she that give the lictor rod and axe 
to wait my six time consulship in Rome 
will not pursue where erst she flatter so 
Minturnum then farewell for I must go 
but think for to repent you of your no 

nay stay my lord and deign in private here 
to weight a message of more better worth 
your age and travel must have some relief 
and be not wroth for great man than we 
have fear Rome and roman tyranny 

you talk it now like man confirm in faith 
well let i try the fruit of your discourse 
for care my mind and pain my body wrong 

then Favorinus shut his lordship up 
within some secret chamber in the state 
meanwhile we will consult to keep he safe 
and work some secret mean for his supply 

be trusty lord if not I can but die Exit Ma 

poor hapless roman little wot thou 
the weary end of thy oppress life 

why my Pausanius what import these word 

o Lucius age have print in my thought 
a memory of many trouble past 
the great town and lord of Asia 
have stand on tickle term through simple truth 
the rhodian record weil can witness this 
then to prevent our mean of overthrow 
find out some stranger that may sudden 
enter the chamber where as Marius lie 
and cut he short the present of who head 
shall make the roman praise we for our truth 
and Scylla press to grant we privilege 

a barbarous act to wrong the man that trust 

in country cause in justice prove just 
Come Lucius let not silly thought of right 
subject our city to the roman might 
for why you know in Marius only end 
Rome will reward and Scylla will be friend 

yet all succession will we discommend exeunt 

the way ward lady of this wicked world 
that lead in luckless triumph wretched man 
my roman friend have force our desire 
and frame our mind to brook too base relief 
what land or libyan desert be unsought 
to find my father Marius and your friend 
yea they who true relent can never touch 
these fierce numidian hear our mishap 
weep flood of moan to wail our wretched fate 
thus we that erst with terror do attaint 
the bactrian bound and in our roman war 
enforce the barbarous borderer of the Alps 
to tremble with the terror of our look 
now fly poor man affright with our harm 
seek amid the desert rock and den 
for he that whilom in our Capitol 
even with a beck command Asia

unsheathe thy sword conduct these warlike man 
to Rome unhappy mistress of our harm 
and there since tyrant power have thou oppress 
and rob thou of thy father friend and all 
so die undaunted kill of thy foe 
that be the offspring of these wretched woe 

why how now Marius will you mate we thus 
that with content adventure for your love 
why noble youth resolve yourself on this 
that son and father both have friend in Rome 
that seek old Marius rest and your relief 

Lectorius friend be geason now adays 
and grow to fume before they taste the fire 
adversity bereave man avail 
they fly like feather dally in the wind 
they rise like bubble in a stormy rain 
swell in word and fly faith and deed 

how fortunate be thou my lovely lord 
that in thy youth may reap the fruit of age 
and have lose occasion holdfast now 
may learn hereafter how to entertain she well 
but sudden hope do swarm about my heart 
be merry roman see where from the coast 
a weary messenger do post he fast

for in his forehead I behold the scar 
wherewith he mark still his barbarous swain 

o stay he good Lectorius for i seem

you minister of Sulla mad conceit 
will consul think you stoop to your control 
these young citizen my fellow lord 
bind to maintain both Marius and his son 
crave but their due and will be hold as good 
for privilege as those of old age 
for they be man conform to feat of arm 
that have both wit and courage to command 
these favorite of Octavius what with age 
and palsy shake their javelin in their hand 
like heartless man attaint all with fear 
and shall they then overtop the youth 
no nor this consul nor mark Anthonie 
shall make my follower faint or lose their right 
but I will have they equal with the best 

why then the senate name who reverence 
have blaze our virtue amid the western I will

so many pen to write these many wrong

why Anthony seal up those sugar lip 
for I will bring my purpose to effect 

do Cynna like to interrupt i then 

i Cynna sir will interrupt you now 
I tell thou mark old Marius be at hand 
the very patron of this happy law 
who will revenge thy cunning eloquence 

I talk not I to please or he or thou 
but what I speak I think and practice too 
it be better Scylla learn to mend in Rome 
than Marius come to tyrannize in Rome 

nay Marius shall not tyrannize in Rome 
old citizen as Scylla late ordain 
king Tullius law shall take their full effect 
the best and age man shall in their choice 
both bear the day and firm election 

o brave Octavius you will beard i then 
the elder consul and old Marius friend 
and these italian freeman must be wrong 
first shall the fruit of all thy honour fail 
and this my poniard shall dispatch thy life 

such insolence be never see in Rome 
nought want here but name to make a king 

strike villain if thou list for I be press 
to make as deep a furrow in thy breast 

the young man voice shall prevail my lord 

and we will firm our honour by our blood 

o false ambitious pride in young and old 
hark how the heaven our folly have control 

what shall we yield for this religious fear 

if not religious fear what may repress 
these wicked passion wretched citizen 
o Rome poor Rome unmeet for these misdeed 
I see contempt of heaven will breed a cross 
sweet Cynna govern rage with reverence 
o fellow citizen be more advise 

we charge you consul now dissolve the court 
the god contemn this brawl and civil jar 

we will submit our honour to their will 
you ancient citizen come follow i 

high jove himself have do too much for thou 
else shall this blade abate thy royalty 
well young italian citizen take heart 
he be at hand that will maintain your right 
that enter in these fatal gate of Rome 
shall make they tremble that disturb you now 
you of Preneste and of Formiae 
with other neighbour city in Campania 
prepare to entertain and succour Marius 

for he we live for he we mean to die 

have these Minturnian then so cruel 
presume so great injustice against their friend 

i Marius all our noble have decree 
to send thy head a present unto Rome 

a Tantal present it will prove my friend 
which with a little smart stress will end 
old Marius life when Rome itself at last 
shall rue my loss and then revenge my death 
but tell i jailer can thou be content 
in be Marius for to brook this wrong 

the high estate your lordship once do wield 
the many friend that fawn when fortune smile 
your great promotion and your mighty wealth 
these be I Marius will amate i so 
as loss of they will vex i more than death 

be lordship then so great a bliss my friend 

no title may compare with princely rule 

be friend so faithful pledge of delight 

what better comfort than be faithful friend 

be wealth a mean to lengthen life content 

where great possession bide what care can touch 

these stale of fortune be the common plague 
that still mislead the thought of simple man 
the shepherd swain that midst his country coat 
delude his break slumber by his toil 
think lordship sweet where care with lordship dwell 
the trustful man that build on trothless vow 
who simple thought be cross with scornful nay 
together weep the loss of wealth and friend 
so lordship friend wealth spring and perish fast 
where death alone yield happy life at last 
o gentle governor of my content 
thou sacred chieftain of our Capitol 
who in thy crystal orb with glorious gleam 
lend look of pity mix with majesty 
see woeful Marius careful for his son 
careless of lordship wealth or worldly mean 
content to live yet live still to die 
who nerve and vein who sinew by the sword 
must lose their working through distemper stroke 
but yet who mind in spite of fate and all 
shall live by fame although the body fall 

why mourn Marius this recureless chance 

I pray thou jailer will thou glad die 

if needs I will 

yet be you loath to try 

why noble lord when good friend fortune fail 
what more than death may woeful man avail 

who call for death my friend for all his scorn 
with Aesop slave will leave his bush of thorn 
but since these traitorous lord will have my head 
their lordship here upon this homely bed 
shall find i sleep breathe forth my breath 
till they their shame and I my fame attain by death 
live gentle Marius to revenge my wrong 
and sirrah see they stay not overlong 
for he that erst have conquer kingdom many 
disdain in death to be subdue by any 

the most undaunted word that ever be 
the mighty thought of his imperious mind 
do wound my heart with terror and remorse 

it be desperate not perfect nobleness 
for to a man that be prepare to die 
the heart shall rent the sleep shall leave the eye 
but say Pedro will you do the deed

ah my Pausanius I have often hear 
that yonder Marius in his infancy 
be bear to great fortune than we deem 
for be scarce from out his cradle creep 
and sport pretty with his compeer 
on sudden seven young eagle soar amain 
and kind perch upon his tender lap 
his parent wonder at this strange event 
take counsel of the soothsayer in this 
who tell they that these sevenfold eagles flight 
fore figure his seven time consulship 
and we ourselves except bewitch with pride 
have see he six time in the Capitol 
accompany with rod and axe too 
and some divine instinct so press i 
that sore I tremble till I set he free 

the like assault attaint my wander mind 
see our bootless war with matchless fate 
let we entreat he to forsake our town 
so shall we gain a friend of Rome and he 
but mark how happy he do awake

choke the river of my restless eye 
or be their rage restrain with matchless ruth 
see how amaze these angry lord behold 
the poor confuse look of wretched Marius 
Minturnian why delay your headsman thus 
to finish up this ruthful tragedy 

far be it Marius from our thought or hand 
to wrong the man protect by the god 
live happy Marius so thou leave our town 

and must I wrestle once again with fate 
or will these prince dally with my age 

no matchless roman thy approve mind 
that erst have alter our ambitious wrong 
must flourish still and we thy servant live 
to see thy glory like the swell tide 
exceed the bound of fate and roman rule 
yet leave we lord and seek some safe shed 
where more secure thou may prevent mishap 
for great pursuit and trouble thou await 

you piteous power that with successful hope 
and gentle counsel thwart my deep despair 
old Marius to your mercy recommend 
his hap his life his hazard and his son 
Minturnian I will hence and you shall fly 
occasion of those trouble you expect 
dream not on danger that have fold my life 
lording adieu from wall to wood I wend 
to hill dale rock my wrong for to commend Exit 

fortune vouchsafe thy many care to end exeunt 

you man of Rome my fellow mate in arm 
who three year prowess policy and war 
one hundred three score thousand man at arm 
have overthrow and murder in the field 
who valour to the empire have restore 
all Grecia Asia and jonia 
with Macedonia subject to our foe 
you see the froward custom of our state 
who measure not our many toil abroad 
sit in their cell imagine our harm 
replenish our roman friend with fear 
yea Scylla worthy friend who fortune toil 
and stratagem these stranger may report 
be by false Cynna and his factious friend 
revile condemn and cross without a cause 
yet roman Marius must return to Rome 
of purpose to upbraid your general 
but this undaunted mind that never droop 
this forward body form to suffer toil 
shall haste to Rome where every foe shall rue 
the rash disgrace both of myself and you 

and may it be that those seditious brain 
imagine these presumptuous purpose 

and may it be why man and will thou doubt 
where Scylla deign these danger to averse 
sirrah except not so misdoubt not so 
see here Ancharius letter read the line 
and say Lucretius that I favour thou 
that dare but suspect thy general 

the case conceal have move the more misdoubt 
yet pardon my presumption worthy Scylla 
that to my grief have read these hideous harm 

tut my Lucretius fortune ball be toss 
to form the story of my fatal power 
Rome shall repent babe mother shall repent 
air weep cloudy sorrow shall repent 
wind breathe many sigh shall repent 
to see those storm conceal in my breast 
reflect the hideous flame of their unrest 
but word be vain and can quell our wrong 
brief period serve for they that needs must post it 
Lucullus since occasion call i hence 
and all our roman senate think it meet 
that thou pursue the war I have begin 
as by their letter I be certify 
I leave thou fimbrias legion to conduct 
with this proviso that in rule still 
you think on Scylla and his courtesy 

the weighty charge of this continue war 
though strange it seem and over great to wield 
I will accept it so the army please 

happy and fortunate be Lucullus our general 

if he be Sulla friend else not at all 
for otherwise the man be ill best 
that gain glory straight shall lose his head 
but soldier since I needy must to Rome 
Basillus virtue shall have recompense 
Lo here the wreath Valerius for thy pain 
who first do enter Archilous trench 
this pledge of virtue sirrah shall approve 
thy virtue and confirm i in thy love 

happy be Scylla if no foe to Rome 

I like no if from such a simple groom 
I will be happy in despite of state 
and why because I never fear fate 
but come Arcathius for your father sake 
enjoin your fellow prince to their task 
and help to succour these my weary bone 
tut blush not man a great state than thou 
shall pleasure Scylla in more base sort 
Aristion be a jolly timber man 
fit to conduct the chariot of a king 
why be not squeamish for it shall go hard 
but I will give you all a great reward 

humble by fate like wretched man we yield 

Arcathius these be fortune of the field 
believe i these brave captive draw by art 
and I will think upon their good desert 
but stay you stranger and respect my word 
fond heartless man what folly have I see 
for fear of death can prince entertain 
such bastard thought that now from glorious arm 
vouchsafe to draw like ox in a plough 
Arcathius I be sure Mithridates 
will hardly brook the scandal of his name 
it be better in Picaeo to have die 
Aristion than amid our legion thus to draw 

I tell thou Scylla captive have no choice 
and death be dreadful to a caitiff man 

in such imperfect metal as be you 
but roman that be still allure by fame 
choose rather death than blemish of their name 
but I have haste and therefore will reward you 
go soldier with as quick dispatch as may be 
hasten their death and bring they to their end 
and say in this that Scylla be your friend 

o ransom thou our life sweet conqueror 

fie foolish man why fly you happiness 
desire you still to lead a servile life 
dare you not buy delight with little pain 
well for thy father sake Arcathius 
I will prefer thy triumph with the rest 
go take they hence and when we meet in hell 
then tell i prince if I do not well 
Lucullus thus these mighty foe be down 
now strive thou for the king of Pontus crown 
I will to Rome go thou and with thy train 
pursue Mithridates till he be slay 

with fortune help go calm thy country woe 
while I with these seek out our mighty foe 

thou that have walk with troop of flock friend 
now wander amid the labyrinth of woe 
thy best repast with many sigh end 
and none but fortune all these mischief know 
like to these stretch mountain clad with snow 
no sunshine of content my thought approach 
high spire their top my hope no height do know 
but mount so high as time their tract reproach 
they find their spring where winter wrong my mind 
they weep their brook I waste my cheek with tear 
o foolish fate too froward and unkind 
mountain have peace where mournful be my year 
yet high as they my thought some hope will borrow 
but when I count the evening end with sorrow 
death in Minturnum threaten Marius head 
hunger in these numidian mountain dwell 
thus with prevention have mischief flee 
old Marius find a world of many hell 
such as poor simple wit have oft repine 
but I will quell by virtue of the mind 
long year misspend in many luckless chance 
thought full of wrath yet little worth succeed 
these be the mean for those who fate advance 
but I who wound be fresh my heart still bleed 
live to entreat this bless boon from fate 
that I may die with grief to live in state 
six hundred son with solitary walk 
I still have seek for to delude my pain 
and friendly echo answer to my talk 
rebound the accent of my ruth again 
she courteous nymph the woeful roman please

sweet nymph draw near thou kind and gentle echo echo 
what help to ease my weary pain have I I 
what comfort in distress to calm my grief grief

with deep despair late overtake whole Oly 
and will the heaven be never well appease appease

nought better fit old Marius mind then war than war 
then full of hope say echo shall I go go 
be any better fortune than at hand at hand 
then farewell echo gentle nymph farewell farewell

then to the downfall of my happiness 
then to the ruin of this city Rome 
but if my inward ruth be lay in sight 
my stream of tear shall drown my foe despite 

courage lord Anthony if fortune please 
she will and can these trouble soon appease 
but if her backward frown approach we nigh 
resolve with we with honour for to die 

no storm of fate shall bring my sorrow down 
but if that fortune list why let her frown 

where state be oppress by cruel tyrant be 
old Anthony there be no place for thou 
hark by this thunder noise of threaten drum 
Marius with all his faction hither come 

then like a traitor he shall know ere long 
in levy arm he do his country wrong 

and have we get the goal of honour now 
and in despite of consul enter Rome 
then rouse thou Marius leave thy ruthful thought 
and for thy many toil and care sustain 
afflict thy foe with twice as many pain 
go soldier seek out Bebius and his friend 
Attilius Munitorius with the rest 
cut off their head for they do cross i once 
and if your care can compass my decree 
remember that same fugitive mark Anthony 
who fatal end shall be my fruitful peace 
I tell thou Cynna nature arm beast 
with just revenge and dare in their kind 
sufficient warlike weapon of defence 
if then by nature beast revenge their wrong 
both heaven and nature grant i vengeance now 
yet while I live and suck this subtle air 
that dare breathe coolness to my light 
the register of all thy righteous act 
thy pain thy toil thy travel for my sake 
shall dwell by kind impression in my heart 
and I with link of true unfeigned love 
will lock these roman favorite in my breast 
and live to hazard life for their relief 

my lord your safe and swift return to Rome 
make Cynna fortunate and well apay 
who through the false suggestion of my foe 
be make a coffer of a consul here 
lo where he sit command in his throne 
that wrong Marius i and all these lord 

to quite his love Cynna let i alone 
how fare these lord that lump pout proud 
imagine how to quell i with their look 
no welcome sir be Marius think so base 
why stand you look baby in my face 
who welcome i he Marius make his friend 
who lour on i he Marius mean to end 

happy and fortunate thy return to Rome 

and long Marius live with fame in Rome 

I thank you courteous lord that be so kind 

but why endure your grace that brave mate 
to sit and face we in his robe of state 

my son he be a consul at the least 
and gravity become Octavius best 
but Cynna will in yonder empty seat 
you will for Marius freedom once entreat 

avaunt thou traitor proud and insolent 
how dare thou press new civil government 

why master consul be you grow so hot 
he have a present cool card for you 
be therefore well advise and move i not 
for though by you I be exile from Rome 
and in the desert from a prince seat 
leave to bewail ingratitude of Rome 
though I have know your thirsty throat have long 
to baine themselves in my distil blood 
yet Marius sir have pity join with power 
lo here the imperial ensign which I wield 
that wave mercy to my wisher well 
and more see here the dangerous troth of war 
that at the point be steel with ghastly death 

thou exile threaten thou a consul then 
lictor go draw he hence such brave mate 
be not to boast their arm in quiet state 

go draw i hence what not relent Octavius 

my lord what heart in with revenge 
can leave this lozel threaten murder thus 
vouchsafe i leave to taint that traitor seat 
with flow stream of his contagious blood 

the father son I know he by his talk 
that scold in word when finger can walk 
but jove I hope will one day send to Rome 
the bless patron of this monarchy 
who will revenge injustice by his sword 

such brave hope such curse argument 
so strict command such arrogant control 
suffer i Marius that be consul now 
to do thou justice and confound the wretch 

Cynna you know I be a private man 
that still submit my censure to your will 

then soldier draw this traitor from the throne 
and let he die for Cynna will it so 

I now my Cynna noble consul speak 
Octavius your check shall cost you dear 

and let i die for Cynna will it so 
be then the reverence of this robe contemn 
be these associate of so small regard 
why then Octavius willing consent 
to entertain the sentence of his death 
but let the proud traitor work his will 
I fear no stroke but here will sit i still 
since justice sleep since tyrant reign in Rome 
Octavius long for death to die for Rome 

then strike he where he sit then hale he hence 

heaven punish Cinna pride and thy offence 

now be he fall that threaten Marius 
now will I sit and plead for Marius 

thou do i justice Cynna for you see 
these peer of Rome have late exile i 

your lordship do injustice to accuse 
those who in your behalf do not offend 

we grieve to see the age Marius 
stand like a private man in view of Rome 

then bid he sit and lo a empty place 
revoke his exile firm his government 
and so prevent your far detriment 

we will account both Marius and his friend 
his son and all his follower free in Rome 
and since we see the dangerous time at hand 
and here of Sulla confidence and haste 
and know his hate and rancor to these lord 
and he create for consul to prevent 
the policy of Scylla and his friend 

then both confirm by state and full consent 
the rod and axe to Marius I present 
and here invest thou with the consul pall 

long fortunate and happy life betide 
old Marius in his sevenfold consulship 

and so let Marius live and govern Rome 
as curse Scylla never look on Rome 

then place in consul throne you roman state 
recall from banishment by your decree 
install in this imperial seat to rule 
old Marius thank his friend and favorite 
from who this final favour he require 
that see Scylla by his murderous blade 
bring fierce sedition first to head in Rome 
and force law to banish innocent 
I crave by course of reason and desert 
that he may be proclaim as erst be I 
a traitor and a enemy of Rome 
let all his friend be banish out of town 
then cut off the branch where trouble spring 
Rome shall have peace and plenty in her wall 

in equity it needs must be my friend 
that one be guilty of our common harm 
and since that Marius be account free 
Scylla with all his friend must traitor be 

my father reason roman be of force 
for if you see and live not too secure 
you know that in so great a state as this 
two mighty foe can never well agree 

then let we seek to please our consul first 
and then prepare to keep the exile out 
Cynna as Marius and these lord agree 
firm this edict and let it pass for i 

then roman in the name of all this state 
I here proclaim and publish this decree 
that Scylla with his friend ally and all 
be banish exile traitor unto Rome 
and to extinguish both his name and state 
we will his house be raze to the ground 
his good confiscate this our censure be

the frolic citizen of forest lung 
their lay and merry note on perch bough 
when sudden appear in the east 
seven mighty eagle with their talent fierce 
who wave oft about our consul head 
at last with hideous cry do scare away 
when sudden old Marius all aghast 
with reverent smile determine with a sigh 
the doubtful silence of the stander by 
roman say he old Marius now must die 
these seven fair eagle bird of mighty jove 
that at my birth day on my cradle sit

sedition murder and conspiracy 
imagine with unpartial heart at last 
what fruit proceed from these contentious brawl 
your street where erst the father of your state 
in robe of purple walk up and down 
be strew with mangle member stream blood 
and why the reason of this ruthful wrack 
be your seditious innovation 
your fickle mind incline to foolish change 
ungrateful man while I with tedious pain 
in Asia seal my duty with my blood 
make the fierce Dardanian faint for fear 
spread my colour in Galatia 
dip my sword in the enetan blood 
and forage the field of Phocida 
you call my foe from exile with his friend 
you do proclaim i traitor here in Rome 
you raze my house you do deface my friend 
but brawl wolf you can bite the moon 
for Scylla live so forward to revenge 
as woe to those that seek to do i wrong 
I now be enter Rome in spite of force 
and will so hamper all my curse foe 
as be he tribune consul lord or knight 
that hate Scylla let he look to die 
and first to make a entrance to my ire

and for my sake establish peace in Rome 
and pardon these repentant citizen 

Pompey I love thou Pompey and consent

you fight it out in hope that I will faint 
but sirrah now betake you to your book 
entreat the god to save your sinful soul 
for why this carcase must in my behalf 
go feast the raven that serve our augur turn 
methinks I see already how they wish 
to bait their beak in such a jolly dish 

Scylla thy threat and scoff amate i not 
I pray thou let thy murderer have i hence 
for Carbo rather like to die by sword 
than live to be a mock stock to thou 

the man have have good soldier take he hence 
it will be good to alter his pretence 
but be advise that when the fool be slay 
you part the head and body both in twain 
I know that Carbo long to know the cause 
and shall thy body for the raven thy head for daw

but whether press these mince senator

dictator power and place who majesty 
shall cross the courage of rebellious mind 
what think you roman will you condescend

must humble their opinion to their lord 
and if my friend and citizen consent

I speak not this as though I wish to reign 
but for to know my friend and yet again 
I merit roman far more grace than this

and that I may with kindness quite their love 
my countryman I will prevent the cause 
against all the false encounter of mishap 
you name i your dictator but prefix 
no time no course but give i leave to rule 
and yet exempt i not from your revenge 
thus by your pleasure be set aloft 
straight by your fury I shall quick fall 
no citizen who read Sulla mind 
must form my title in another kind 
either let Scylla be dictator ever 
or flatter Scylla with these title never 

perpetual be thy glory and renown 
perpetual lord dictator shall thou be 

hereto the senate frank do agree 

then so shall Scylla reign you senator 
then so shall Scylla rule you citizen 
as senator and citizen that please i 
shall be my friend the rest can disease i 
but see whereas Lucretius be return 
welcome brave roman where be Marius 
be these Prenestian put unto the sword 

the city noble Scylla raze be 
and Marius dead not by our sword my lord 
but with more constancy than Cato die 

what constancy and but a very boy 
why then I see he be his father son 
but let we have this constancy describe 

after our fierce assault and their resist 
our siege their sally out to stop our trench 
labour and hunger rain in the town 
the young Marius on the city wall 
vouchsafe a interparle at the last 
wherein with constancy and courage too 
he bold arm his friend himself to death 
and spread of his colour on the wall 
for answer say he can not brook to yield 
or trust a tyrant such as Scylla be 

what do the brainsick boy upbraid i so 
but let we hear the rest Lucretius 

and after great persuasion to his friend 
and worthy resolution of they all 
he first do sheathe his poniard in his breast 
and so in order die all the rest 

now by my sword this be a worthy jest 
yet silly boy I needs must pity thou 
who noble mind can never mate be 
believe i countryman a sudden thought 
a sudden change in Scylla now have wrought 
old Marius and his son be man of name 
nor fortune laugh nor lour their mind can tame 
and when I count their fortune that be past 
I see that death confirm their fame at last 
then he that strive to manage mighty thing 
amid his triumph gain a trouble mind 
the great hope the great harm it bring 
and poor man in content their glory find 
if then content be such a pleasant thing 
why leave I country life to live a king 
yet king be god and make the proud stoop 
you but themselves be still pursue with hate 
and man be make to mount and then to droop 
such chance wait upon incertain fate 
that where she kiss once she quell twice 
then who so live content be happy wise 
what motion move this philosophy 
o Scylla see the ocean ebb and float 
the springtime wane when winter draw nigh 
ay these be true and most assure note 
inconstant chance such tickle turn have leave 
as who so fear no fall must seek content 

while grave thought of honour shall allure thou 
what make Scylla muse and mutter thus 

I that have pass amid the mighty troop 
of arm legion through a world of war 
do now bethink i Flaccus on my chance 
how I alone where many man be slay 
in spite of fate be come to Rome again 
and so I wield the reverend style of state 
yea Scylla with a beck can break thy neck 
what lord of Rome have dare as much as I 
yet Flaccus know thou not that I must die 
the labour sister on the weary loom 
have draw my web of life at length I know 
and man of wit must think upon their tomb 
for beast wit careless step to Lethe 
where man who thought and honour climb on high 
live with fame must learn with fame to die 

what let we my lord in govern this state 
to live in rest and die with honour too 

what let i Pompey why my courteous friend 
can he remain secure that wield a charge 
or think of wit when flatterer do commend 
or be advise that careless run at large 
no Pompey honey word make foolish mind 
and pour the great wit with error blind 
Flaccus I murder Anthony thy friend 
roman some here have lose at my command 
their father mother brother and ally 
and think you Scylla think these misdeed 
be think not on your grudge and mislike 
yes countryman I bear they still in mind 
then Pompey be I not a silly man 
to leave my rule and trust these roman then 

your grace have small occasion of mistrust 
nor seek these citizen for your disclaim 

but Pompey now these reach plume of pride 
that mount up my fortune to the cloud 
by grave conceit shall straight be lay aside 
and Scylla think of far more simple shrowd 
for have try occasion in the throne 
I will see if she dare frown when state be go 
Loe senator the man that sit aloft 
now deign to give inferior high place 
Loe here the man who Rome repine oft 
a private man content to brook disgrace 
roman lo here the axe rod and all 
I will master fortune lest she make i thrall 
now who so list accuse i tell my wrong 
upbray i in the presence of this state 
be none these jolly citizen among 
that will accuse or say I be ingrate 
then will I say and bold boast my chance 
that nought may force the man who fate advance 

what mean Scylla in this sullen mood 
to leave his title on the sudden thus 

consul I mean with calm and quiet mind 
to pass my day while happy death I find 

what great wrong than leave thy country so 

both it and life must Scylla leave in time 

yet during life have care of Rome and we 

oh wanton world that flatter in thy prime 
and breathe balm and poison mix in one 
see how these waver roman wish my reign 
that whilom l be seek and seek to have i slay 
my countryman this city want no store 
of father warrior to supply my room 
so grant i peace and I will die for Rome

o Scylla these be stale of destiny 
by some upbraid to try thy constancy 
my friend these scorn of you perhaps will move 
the next dictator shun to yield his state 
for fear he find as much as Scylla do 
but Flaccus to prevent their further wrong 
vouchsafe some lictor may attach the man 
and do they right that thus complain abuse

to cool his heat and make the wanton chaste 

we thank your mastership come neighbour let we jog faith this news will set my daughter Dorothy a gog exeunt cum lictore 

grave senator and roman now you see 
the humble bent of Sulla change mind 
now will I leave you lord from courtly train 
to dwell content amid my country cave 
where no ambitious humour shall approach 
the quiet silence of my happy sleep 
where no delicious jouissance or toy 
shall tickle with delight my temper ear 
but weary out the linger day with toil 
tire my vein and furrow of my soul 
the silent night with slumber steal on 
shall lock these careful closet of my eye 
o have I know the height of happiness 
or bend my eye upon my mother earth 
long since o Rome have Scylla with rejoice 
forsake arm to lead a private life 

but in this humbleness of mind my lord 
whereas experience prove and be do meet 
how happy be these fair italian field 
if they be grace with so sweet a sun 
then I for Rome and Rome with i require 
that Scylla will abide and govern Rome 

o Flaccus if the arabian phoenix strive 
by nature warning to renew her kind 
when soar nigh the glorious eye of heaven 
she from her cinder do revive her sex 
why shall not Scylla learn by she to die 
that erst have be the phoenix of this land 
And draw near the sunshine of content 
perish obscure to make your glory grow 
for as the high tree do shield the shrub 
from post Phlegon warmth and breathe fire 
so mighty man obscure each other fame 
and make the best deserver fortune game 
but ah what sudden fury do affright 
what apparitious fantasy be these 
o let i rest sweet lord for why methinks 
some fatal spell be sound in my ear 

subsequitur tua ●ors privari lumine scillam 
numina Parcarumiam iam fera precipiunt 
precipiunt fera iam parcarum numina scillam 
lumine privari mors tua subsequitur 
Elysium petis o foelix & fatidici astri 
praescius heroas o petis innumeros 
innumeros petis o heroas praescius astri 
fatidici & foelix o petis Elysium 

ergóne post dulces annos properantia fata 
ergóne iam tenebrae pramia lucis erunt 
attamen ut vitae fortunam gloria mortis 
vincat in extremo funere cantet olor 

how fare my lord what dreadful thought be these 
what doubtful answer on a sudden thus 

Pompey the man that make the world to stoop 
and fetter fortune in the chain of power 
must droop and draw the chariot of fate 
along the darksome bank of Acheron 
the heaven have warn i of my present fall 
o call Cornelia forth let Scylla see 
his daughter Fulvia ere his eye be shut 

why Scylla where be now thy wont hope 
in great hazard of unstaid chance 
what shall a little bite blast of pain 
blemish the blossom of thy wont pride 

my Flaccus worldly joy and pleasure fade 
in constant time like to the fleet tide 
with endless course man hope do overbear 
nought now remain that Scylla fain will have 
but last fame when body lie in grave 

how fare my lord how do my gentle Scylla 

ah my Cornelia pass happy now 
free from the world ally unto the heaven 
not curious of incertain chance now 

word full of woe still add to my grief 
a cureless cross of many hundred harm 
o let not Rome and poor Cornelia lose 
the one her friend the other her delight 

Cornelia man have power by some instinct 
and gracious revolution of the star 
to conquer kingdom not to master fate 
for when the course of mortal life be run 
than Clotho end the web her sister spin 
Pompey lord Flaccus fellow senator 
in that I feel the faintful dew of death 
steep my eye within their chilly wet 
the care I have of wife and daughter both 
must on your wisdom happy rely 
with equal distribution see you part 
my land and good betwixt these lovely twain 
only bestow a hundred thousand sesterce 
upon my friend and fellow soldier 
thus have make my final testament 
come Fulvia let thy father lay his hand 
upon thy lovely bosom and entreat 
a virtuous boon and favour at thy hand 
fair roman maid see that thou wed thy fair 
to modest virtuous and delightful thought 
let Rome in view thou behold thy sire 
honour Cornelia from who fruitful womb 
thy plenteous beauty sweet do appear 
and with this lesson lovely maid farewell 

o tedious and unhappy chance for i 

content thou Fulvia for it needs must be 
Cornelia I must leave thou to the world 
and by those love that I have lend thou oft 
in mutual wedlock rite and happy war 
Remember Scylla in my Fulvia still 
consul farewell my Pompey I must hence 
and farewell Rome and fortune now I bless thou 
that both in life and death will not oppress i die 

o hideous storm of never daunt fate 
now be those eye who sweet reflection cool 
the smother rancour of rebellious thought 
clad with the sable mantle of the night 
and like the tree that rob of sun and shower 
mourn desolate without leaf or sap 
so poor Cornelia late bereave of love 
sit sigh hapless joyless and forlorn 

go be the flower that do adorn our field 
flee be those sweet reflection of delight 
dead be my father Fulvia dead be he 
in who thy life for who thy death must be 

lady to tire the time in restless moan 
be tedious unto friend and nature too 
suffice you that Scylla so be dead 
as fame shall sing his power though life be flee 

then to conclude his happiness my lord 
determine where shall be his funeral 

Even there where other noble be inter 

why Lepidus what roman ever be 
that merit so high a name as he 
then why with simple pomp and funeral 
will you entomb so rare a paragon 

a urn of gold shall hem his ash in 
the vestal virgin with their holy note 
shall sing his famous though too fatal death 
I and my Fulvia with disperse hair 
will weight upon this noble roman hearse 

and Fulvia clad in black and mournful pale 
will weight upon her father funeral 

Come bear we hence this trophy of renown 
who life who death be far from fortune frown
