old man be the true lover young man be inconstant and wag with every wind we never move but be as true as steel 

but in woman matter as weak as water as weak as water 

beside sweet love but do I court a shadow to see whither love will carry a man let i see I can find in my heart to bestow a ring upon my sweetheart but that I be loath to part with it hem I will get but one child and that shall be a boy lest have too many child I undo my heir and my good be divide o sweet Selina oh amiable Selina sure I be not old 

I have it signior Gasparo pray let i begin with my merchant if you love i and if you like it second i 

go to Gorgon let we see thy window 

old man walk with a staff and creep along the street hold their head below their girdle falter in their speech foam at mouth and breathe ten time in a furlong and be ready to spit their lung on every man threshold 

God save you sir 

God a mercy honest Gorgon 

I cry you mercy sir I will assure you sir I take you for master Rufaldo the old merchant 

why and be not I be not the fellow drink I be Rufaldo 

it may be some kin to he but not that Rufaldo I mean you be young a fair deal 

I be that Rufaldo the merchant that bury my wife late and have one daughter Hilaria ancient acquaintance with Cornelio and your master Antonio 

o sir you must excuse i for that 

be thy name Gorgon 

what else sir honest Gorgon I 

do I know thou to be Gorgon what shall I be face out of myself why thou varlet who be I if not Rufaldo 

why sir it be plain you have no grey hair in your head your cheek be scarlet a wanton youthful eye Rufaldo have a head like frost his eye sink into his hollow a rugged brow a hoary beard and all his body not worth a drop of blood a very crazy old mealmouthed gentleman you be young at least by thirty year 

I will assure thou I be Rufaldo when I rise in the morning 

you have not sleep since have you 

no 

it be the more strange I have hear of some that have be change in a dream but never wake before this be strange nay admirable 

young change be sure thou do not mock 

I be a very knave then if you be Rufaldo I hope your worship know I have be bind to my good behaviour 

alter young ha I will I be and yet methinks I be lively than I be I feel my joint pliable as wax and my voice be strong too but tell i honest Gorgon be it possible for a old man to be young again 

nay I see you will not believe i well sir I will be bold to report the wonder abroad and astonish all your friend 

nay stay honest Gorgon ha young no grey hair stay who be here 

ha it be not he I will speak to he no it be in vain I will see if he know i he pass by 

Gasparo what do not he know i too 

sir I shall know you be you not signior Petrucchio the dance master 

trick passage I be Rufaldo old Rufaldo 

Rufaldo indeed be old but you be young you do retain his countenance I will swear you be he but you be young far 

it be so I be change I be young than I be I be that Rufaldo believe I know you to be a learned gentleman name Gasparo I be tell afore I be alter but not to trouble you with many question only one Gasparo be it a thing possible for a old man to be young again I know it be admirable but be it possible you be a scholar 

possible o yes there be no question for we see by experience stag cast their old horn and prove vigorous snake cast off their old coat eagle renew their age your plant do it familiar the phoenix when she be old burn herself to ash from thence revive a young phoenix again possible I have hear some old man have be twice child sir therefore this not impossible 

it be very strange I be not yet confident 

there be receipt in physic sir to keep they young save that time run on a little beforehand with they yes and to make young since it be hard to make alive when they be dead than to make young when they be alive and physic do revive some out of all question though not so familiar as kill for that they do with a little study marry I think if it be as gainful to the physician to restore as to destroy he will practise the art of recovery very faithful 

why do you think it will not prove as gainful 

oh by no mean for where a old man will give a hundred pound to have forty or fifty year wipe off the old score of his life his wife or next heir will join rather than fail to outbid he half on it to put he out of debt quite and to send his old leak vessel into mare mortuum 

well well but if I be young I have take no physic for it 

if nay it be past if and and too you be certain restore let i see you look like one of four or six and thirty not a minute above and so much a man may take you for 

well I know not what to say to it there be some power in love have bless i now Selina be thou gracious 

be you in love nay the wonder be not so great who can express the power of love I have read of a painter name Pygmalion that make the picture of a woman so to the life that he fall in love with it court it lie in bed with it and by power of love it become a softnatured wench indeed and he beget I know not how many child of she well sir Selina can choose but be mad for you 

not mad Gasparo I will be loath to be trouble with she and she be mad 

yes and she be mad in love there be no harm in it she can be too mad in love your cornucopia may be abate at pleasure beside sir the best moral man say love itself be a madness and the mad your wife be the more sure you may be she love you 

no no I love no madness on any condition for fear of be hornmad 

why sir madness be not such a discredit as the age go you know there be many mad fashion and what man but some time may be mad be not your great man mad that when they have enough will pawn their soul for a monopoly beside mad lord what do you think of lady at some time of the moon you may spell they in their name madam you have mad courtier that run mad after citizen wife the citizen be mad too to trust they with their ware who have be so deep in their wife book before your justice of peace be some time mad too for when he may see well enough he will suffer any man to put out his eye with a bribe some lawyer be often starkmad and talk wild no man be able to endure their term 

prithee madcap leave I be almost mad to hear thou 

well my old young Rufaldo if you marry Selina I shall have a pair of glove I hope and you will let i dance at your wedding 

that thou shall boy and I will dance myself too hey 

farewell credulity ha ha with what a greediness do old man run out of their wit it be a good recreation to see with what pleasure he suffer himself to be gull faith Gasparo play out thy hand now thou be in methinks I have a excellent appetite to make myself merry with the simplicity of this age let i see it be spring and I mean to give my head a purgation it may beat off the remembrance of my lose love Felice a pox of melancholy I will act two or three part if I live in spite of it and if I die then 

signior Gasparo my master will speak with you the project too I meet the youth strut like a gentleman usher it be my invention 

but I give it polish Gorgon 

I confess you take off the roughcast but it be Gorgon head bring forth the project from my jove brain come this Minerva

who I a wit I think you have more wit than to make such a question all the town take i for a wit here be a pate have craker in it and flash 

and thou say the word we will join in a project of wit to make a ass of the world a little it shall make we merry if it take no other way will join 

by this hand any project of wit what be it good Gasparo the project 

can be close 

as midnight to a bawd or a pair of truss to a irish man buttock 

go to thou shall now then excuse i to thy master I will present furnish myself with new lodging and expect to hear from i short my brave delphic I have it in embrio and I shall soon be deliver 

if I fail call i spidercatcher

god in shepherd weed again 
a hundred pretty nymph apace

sometime we dance a fairy round 
hand in hand upon the ground 
shepherd pipe garland crown 
with our harmless bosom drown 

walk unto the silver brook 
you shall need no other hook 
to catch the dance fish withal 
but a song or madrigal 

when the cloud let fall their shower 
we have at hand a hundred bower 
where under sweetbriar safe be we 
and honeydropping woodbine tree 
here in spite of storm we tell 
story of love of Philomel 
of Paris and the golden ball 
of echo and Narcissus fall

but sure you be exempt from such 
a misery what then

and have no other tomb but air
