Parmenio I can tell whether I shall more commend in Alexander victory courage or courtesy in the one be a resolution without fear in the other a liberality above custom Thebes be raise the people not rack tower throw down body not thrust aside a conquest without conflict and a cruel war in a mild peace 

Clytus it become the son of Philip to be none other than Alexander be therefore see in the father a full perfection who can have doubt in the son a excellency for as the moon can borrow nothing else of the sun but light so of a fire in who nothing but virtue be what can the child receive but singular it be for Turk to stain each other not for Dyamorde in the one to be make a difference in goodness in the other no comparison 

you mistake i Parmenio if while I commend Alexander you imagine I call Philip into question unless happy you conjecture which none of judgement will conceive that because I like the fruit therefore I heave at the tree or covet to kiss the child I therefore go about to poison the teat 

ay but Clytus I perceive you be bear in the east and never laugh but at the sun rise which argue though a duty where you ought yet no great devotion where you may 

we will make no controversy of that which there ought to be no question only this shall be the opinion of we both that none be worthy to be the father of Alexander but Philip nor any meet to be the son of Philip but Alexander 

soft Clytus behold the spoil and prisoner a pleasant sight to we because profit be join with honour not much painful to they because their captivity be ease by mercy 

fortune thou do never yet deceive virtue because virtue never yet do trust fortune sword and fire will never get spoil where wisdom and fortitude bear sway o Thebes thy wall be raise by the sweetness of the harp but raze by the shrillness of the trumpet Alexander have never come so near the wall have Epaminondas walk about the wall and yet may the theban have be merry in their street if he have be to watch their tower but destiny be seldom foresee never prevent we be here now captive who neck be yoke by force but who heart can not yield by death Come Campaspe and the rest let we not be ashamed to cast our eye on he on who we fear not to cast our dart 

madam you need not doubt it be Alexander that be the conqueror 

Alexander have overcome not conquer 

to bring all under his subjection be to conquer 

he can subdue that which be divine 

Thebes be not 

virtue be 

Alexander as he tender virtue so he will you he drink not blood but thirst after honour he be greedy of victory but never satisfy with mercy in fight terrible as become a captain in conquest mild as beseem a king in all thing then which nothing can be great he be Alexander 

then if it be such a thing to be Alexander I hope it shall be not miserable thing to be a virgin for if he save our honour it be more than to restore our good and rather do I wish he preserve our fame then our life which if he do we will confess there can be no great thing than to be Alexander 

Clytus be these prisoner of whence these spoil 

like your majesty they be prisoner and of Thebes 

of what calling or reputation 

I know not but they seem to be lady of honour 

I will know madam of whence you be I know but who I can tell 

Alexander I be the sister of Theagines who fight a battle with thy father before the city of Chyeronie where he die I say which none can gainsay valiant 

lady there seem in your word spark of your brother deed but worse fortune in your life than his death but fear not for you shall live without violence enemy or necessity but what be you fair lady another sister to Theagines 

no sister to Theagines but a humble handmaid to Alexander bear of a mean parentage but to extreme fortune 

well lady for so your virtue show you whatsoever your birth be you shall be honourable entreat Athens shall be your Thebes and you shall not be as abject of war but as subject to Alexander Parmenio conduct these honourable lady into the city charge the soldier not so much as in word to offer they any offence and let all want be supply so far forth as shall be necessary for such person and my prisoner 
Hephestion it rest now that we have as great care to govern in peace as conquer in war that while arm cease art may flourish and join letter with lance we endeavour to be as good philosopher as soldier know it no less praise to be wise than commendable to be valiant 

your majesty therein show that you have as great desire to rule as to subdue and needs must that common wealth be fortunate who captain be a philosopher and who philosopher be a captain 

I serve in steed of a master a mouse who house be a tub who dinner be a crust and who board be a bed 

then be thou in a state of life which philosopher commend a crumb for thy supper a hand for thy cup and thy clothes for thy sheet for natura paucis contenta 

Manes it be pity so proper a man shall be cast away upon a philosopher but that Diogenes that dog shall have mane that dogbolte it grieve nature and spite art the one have find the so dissolute absolute I will say in body the other so single singular in mind 

be you merry it be a sign by the trip of your tongue and the toy of your head that you have do that today which I have not do these three day 

what be that 

dine 

I think Diogenes keep but cold cheer 

I will it be so but he keep neither hot nor cold 

what then luke warm that make mane run from his master last day 

Manes have reason for his name foretell as much 

my name how so sir boy 

you know that it be call mons à movendo because it stand still 

good 

and thou be name manes à manendo because thou run away 

pass reason I do not run away but retire 

to a prison because thou will have leisure to contemplate 

I will prove that my body be immortal because it be in prison 

as how 

do your master never teach you that the soul be immortal 

yes 

and the body be the prison of the soul 

true 

why then thus to make my body immortal I put it to prison 

o bad 

excellent ill 

you may see how dull a fast wit be therefore Psyllus let we go to supper with Granichus Plato be the best fellow of all philosopher give i he that read in the morning in the school and at noon in the kitchen 

and i 

ah sir my master be a king in his parlour for the body and a god in his study for the soul among all his man he commend one that be a excellent musician then stand I by and clap another on the shoulder and say this be a pass good cook 

it be well do Granichus for give i pleasure that go in at the mouth not the ear I have rather fill my gut than my brain 

I serve Apelles who feed i as Diogenes do manes for at dinner the one preach abstinence the other commend counterfeit when I will eat meat he paint a spit and when I thirst oh faith he be not this a fair pot and point to a table which contain the banquet of the god where be many dish to feed the eye but not to fill the gut 

what do thou then 

this do he then bring in many example that some have live by favour and prove that much easy it be to fat by colour and tell of bird that have be fat by paint grape in winter and how many have so feed their eye with their mistress picture that they never desire to take food be glut with the delight in their favour then do he show i counterfeit such as have forfeit with their filthy and loathsome vomit and with the riotous Bacchanal of the god Bacchus and his disorderly crew which be paint all to the life in his shop to conclude I fare hardly though I go rich which make i when I shall begin to shadow a lady face to draw a lamb head and sometime to set to the body of a maid a shoulder of mutton for semper animus meus est in patinis 

thou be a god to i for can I see but a cook shop paint I will make my eye fat as butter for I have nought but sentence to fill my maw as plures occidit crapula quàm gladius musateiunantibus amica repletion kill delicate and a old saw of abstinence Socrates the belly be the head grave thus with say not with meat he make a gallimaufry 

but how do thou then live 

with fine jest sweet air and the dog alm 

well for this time I will staunch thy gut and among pot and platter thou shall see what it be to serve Plato 

for joy of Granichus let we sing 

my voice be as clear in the evening as in the morning 

another commodity of emptiness 

I have never such ado to warn scholar to come before a king first I come to Chrysippus a tall lean old mad man will he present to appear before Alexander he stand stare on my face neither move his eye nor his body I urge he to give some answer he take up a book sit down and say nothing Melissa his maid tell i it be his manner and that oftentimes she be fain to thrust meat in to his mouth for that he will rather starve than cease study well think I see bookish man be so blockish and so great clerk such simple courtier I will neither be partaker of their commons nor their commendation from thence I come to Plato and to Aristotle and to diverse other none refuse to come save a old obscure fellow who sit in a tub turn towards the son read greek to a young boy he when I will to appear before Alexander he answer if Alexander will fain see i let he come to i if learn of i let he come to i whatsoever it be let he come to i why say I he be a king he answer why I be a philosopher why but he be Alexander I but I be Diogenes I be half angry to see one so crooked in his shape to be so crabbed in his say So go my way I say thou shall repent it if thou come not to Alexander nay smile answer he Alexander may repent it if he come not to Diogenes virtue must be seek not offer and so turn himself to his cell he grunt I know not what like a pig under a tub but I must be go the philosopher be come 

it be a difficult controversy Aristotle and rather to be wonder at then believe how natural cause shall work supernal effect 

I do not so much stand upon the apparition be see in the moon neither the demonium of Socrates as that I can by natural reason give any reason of the ebb and flow of the sea which make i in the depth of my study to cry out oh ens entium miserere mei 

Cleanthes and you attribute so much to nature by search for thing which be not to be find that while you study a cause of your own you omit the occasion itself there be no man so savage in who rest not this divine particle that there be a omnipotent eternal and divine mover which may be call God 

I be of this mind that that first mover which you term God be the instrument of all the moving which we attribute to nature the earth which be mass swim on the sea season divide in themselves fruit grow in themselves the majesty of the sky the whole firmament of the world and whatsoever else appear miraculous what man almost of mean capacity but can prove it natural 

these cause shall be debate at our philosopher feast in which controversy I will take part with Aristotle that there be naturanaturans and yet not God 

and I with Plato that there be deus optimus maximus and not nature 

here come Alexander 

I see Hephestion that these philosopher be here attend for we 

they be not philosopher if they know not their duty 

but I much marvel Diogenes shall be so dogged 

I do not think but his excuse will be better than melippus message 

I will go see he Hephestion because I long to see he that will command Alexander to come to who all the world be like to come Aristotle and the rest sithence my come from Thebes to Athens from a place of conquest to a palace of quiet I have resolve with myself in my court to have as many philosopher as I have in my camp soldier my court shall be a school wherein I will have use as great doctrine in peace as I do in war discipline 

we be all here ready to be command and glad we be that we be command for that nothing better become king then literature which make they come as near to the god in wisdom as they do in dignity 

it be so Aristotle but yet there be among you yea and of your bring up that seek to destroy Alexander Calisthenes Aristotle who treason against his prince shall not be bear out with the reason of his philosophy 

if ever mischief enter into the heart of Calisthenes let Calisthenes suffer for it but that Aristotle ever imagine any such thing of Calisthenes Aristotle do deny 

well Aristotle kindred may blind thou and affection i but in king cause I will not stand to scholar argument this meeting shall be for a commandment that you all frequent my court instruct the young with rule confirm the old with reason let your life be answerable to your learn jest my proceed be contrary to my promise 

you say you will ask every one of they a question which yesternight none of we can answer 

I will Plato of all beast which be the subtle 

that which man hitherto never know 

Aristotle how shall a man be think a god 

in do a thing unpossible for a man 

Crisyppus which be first the day or the night 

the day by a day 

in deed strange question must have strange answer Cleanthes what say you be life or death the strong 

life that suffer so many trouble 

Crates how long shall a man live 

till he think it better to die then live 

Anaxarchus whether do the sea or the earth bring forth most creature 

the earth for the sea be but a part of the earth 

Hephestion methinks they have answer all well and in such question I mean often to try they 

it be better to have in your court a wise man then in your ground a golden i therefore will I lean war to study wisdom be I Alexander 

so will I be I Hephestion but come let we go and give release as I promise to our Theban thrall 

thou be fortunate Aristotle that Alexander be thy scholar 

and all you happy that he be your sovereign 

I can like the man well if he can be content to be but a man 

he seek to draw near to the god in knowledge not to be a God 

let we question a little with Diogenes why he go not with we to Alexander Diogenes thou do forget thy duty that thou go not with we to the king 

and you your profession that you go to the king 

thou take as great pride to be peevish as other do glory to be virtuous 

and thou as great honour be a philosopher to be think courtlike as other shame that be courtier to be account philosopher 

these austere manner set aside it be well know that thou do counterfeit money 

and thou thy manner in that thou do not counterfeit money 

thou have reason to contemn the court be both in body and mind too crooked for a courtier 

as good be crooked and endeavour to make myself straight from the court as to be straight and learn to be crooked at the court 

thou think it a grace to be opposite against Alexander 

and thou to be jump with Alexander 

let we go for in contemn he we shall better please he then in wonder at he 

Plato what do thou think of Diogenes 

to be Socrates furious let we go 

behold mane where thy master be seek either for bone for his dinner or pin for his sleeve I will go salute he 

do so but mum not a word that you see mane 

then stay thou behind and I will go with Psyllus 

all hail Diogenes to your proper person 

all hate to thy peevish condition 

o dog 

what do thou seek for here 

for a man and a beast 

that be easy without thy light to be find be not all these man 

call man 

what beast be it thou look for 

the beast my man Manes 

he be a beast in deed that will serve thou 

So be he that beget thou 

what will thou do if thou shall find mane 

give he leave to do as he have do before 

what be that 

to run away 

why have thou no need of mane 

it be a shame for Diogenes to have need of mane and for mane to have no need of Diogenes 

but put the case he be go will thou entertain any of we two 

upon condition 

what 

that you shall tell i wherefore any of you both be good 

why I be a scholar and well see in philosophy 

and I a apprentice and well see in paint 

well then Granichus be thou a painter to amend thy ill face and thou Psyllus a philosopher to correct thy evil manner but who be that mane 

I care not who I be so I be not mane 

you be take tardy 

let we slip aside gravickiis to see the salutation between mane and his master 

Manes thou know the last day I throw away my dish to drink in my hand because it be superfluous now I be determine to put away my man and serve myself quia non egeo tui velte 

master you know a while ago I run away so do I mean to do again quia'scio tibi esse argentum 

I know I have no money neither will I have ever a man for I be resolve long sithence to put away both my slave money and mave 

So be I determine to shake off both my dog hunger and Diogenes 

o sweet consent between a crowd and a jew harp 

Come let we reconcile they 

it shall not need for this be their use now do they dine one upon another 

how now mane be thou go from thy master 

no I do but now bind myself to he 

why you be at mortalliars 

in faith no we break a bitter jest one upon another 

why thou be as dogged as he 

my father know they both little whelp 

well I will hie i after my master 

why be it supper time with Diogenes 

ay with he at all time when he have meat 

why then every man to his home and let we steal out again anon 

where shall we meet 

why at ala vendibili suspensa badera non est epus 

o Psyllus habeo te leco parentis thou bless I 

stand aside sir boy till you be call Hephestion how do you like the sweet face of Campaspe 

I can but commend the stout courage of Timeclea 

without doubt Campaspe have some great man to her father 

you know Timoclea have Theagines to her brother 

Timoclea still in thy mouth be thou not in love 

not I 

not with Timoclea you mean wherein you resemble the lapwing who cry most where her nest be not and so you lead i from espy your love with Campaspe you cry Timoclea 

can I aswell subdue kingdom as I can my thought or be I as far from ambition as I be from love all the world will account i as valiant in arm as I know myself moderate in affection 

be love a vice 

it be no virtue 

well now shall thou see what small difference I make between Alexander and Hephestion and sith thou have be always partaker of my triumph thou shall be partaker of my torment I love Hephestion I love I love Campaspe a thing far unfit for a macedonian for a king for Alexander why hang thou down thy head Hephestion blush to hear that which I be not ashamed to tell 

may my word crave pardon and my counsel credit I will both discharge the duty of a subject for so I be and the office of a friend for so I will 

speak Hephestion for whatsoever be speak Hephestion speak to Alexander 

I can tell Alexander whether the report be more shameful to be hear or the cause sorrowful to be believe what be the son of Philip king of Macedon become the subject of Campaspe the captive of Thebes be that mind who greatness the world can not contain draw within the compass of a idle allure eye Will you handle the spindle with Hercules when you shall shake the spear with Achilles be the warlike sound of drum and trump turn to the soft noise of lyre and lute the neigh of barb steed who loudness fill the air with terror and who breathe dim the sun with smoke convert to delicate tune and amorous glance o Alexander that soft and yield mind shall not be in he who hard and unconquered heart have make so many yield but you love ah grief but who Campaspe ah shame a maid forsooth unknown unnoble and who can tell whether immodest who eye be frame by art to enamour and who heart be make by nature to enchant ay but she be beautiful yea but not therefore chaste ay but she be comely in all part of the body yea but she may be crooked in some part of the mind ay but she be wise yea but she be a woman beauty be like the blackberry which seem red when it be not ripe resemble precious stone that be polish with honey which the smoth they look the soon they break it be think wonderful among the sea man that mugil of all fish the swift be find in the belly of the bret of all the slow and shall it not seem monstrous to wise man that the heart of the great conqueror of the world shall be find in the hand of the weak creature of nature of a woman of a captive hermine have fair skin but foul liver sepulchre fresh colour but rot bone woman fair face but false heart Remember Alexander thou haste a camp to govern not a chamber fall not from the armour of Mars to the arm of Venus from the fiery assault of war to the maidenly skirmish of love from display the eagle in thy ensign to set down the sparrow I sigh Alexander that where fortune can not conquer folly shall overcome but behold all the perfection that may be in Campaspe a hair curl by nature not art sweet allure eye a fair face make in despite of Venus and a stately port in disdain of Juno a wit apt to conceive and quick to answer a skin as soft as silk and as smooth as jet a long white hand a fine little foot to conclude all part answerable to the best part what of this though she have heavenly gift virtue and beauty be she not of earthly metal flesh and blood you Alexander that will be a God show yourself in this worse than a man so soon to be both oversee and overtake in a woman who false tear know their true time who smooth word wound deep than sharp sword there be no surfeit so dangerous as that of honey nor any poison so deadly as that of love in the one physic can prevail nor in the other counsel 

my case be light Hephestion and not worthy to be call love if reason be a remedy or sentence can salve that sense can conceive little do you know and therefore slight do you regard the dead ember in a private person or live coal in a great prince who passion and thought do as far exceed other in extremity as their calling do in majesty a eclipse in the sun be more than the fall of a star none can conceive the torment of a king unless he be a king who desire be not inferior to their dignity and then judge Hephestion if the agony of love be dangerous in a subject whether they be not more than deadly unto Alexander who deep and not to be conceive sigh cleave the heart in shiver who wound thought can neither be express nor endure cease then Hephestion with argument to seek to refel that which with their deity the god can resist and let this suffice to answer thou that it be a king that love and Alexander who affection be not to be measure by reason be immortal nor I fear i to be bear be intolerable 

I must needs yield when neither reason nor counsel can be hear 

yield Hephestion for Alexander do love and therefore must obtain 

suppose she love not you affection come not by appointment or birth and then as good hate as enforce 

I be a king and will command 

you may to yield to lust by force but to consent to love by fear you can 

why what be that which Alexander may not conquer as he list 

why that which you say the god can resist love 

I be a conqueror she a captive I as fortunate as she fair my greatness may answer her want and the gift of my mind the modesty of she be it not likely then that she shall love be it not reasonable 

you say that in love there be no reason and therefore there can be no likelihood 

no more Hephestion in this case I will use my own counsel and in all other thy advice thou may be a good soldier but never good lover call my page sirrah go present to Apelles and will he to come to i without either delay or excuse 

I go 

in the mean season to recreate my spirit be so near we will go see Diogenes and see where his tub be Diogenes 

who call 

Alexander how happen it that you will not come out of your tub to my palace 

because it be as far from my tub to your palace as from your palace to my tub 

why then do thou owe no reverence to king 

no 

why so 

because they be no god 

they be god of the earth 

yea god of earth 

Plato be not of thy mind 

I be glad of it 

why 

because I will have none of Diogenes mind but Diogenes 

if Alexander have any thing that may pleasure Diogenes let i know and take it 

then take not from i that you can give i the light of the world 

what do thou want 

nothing that you have 

I have the world at command 

and I in contempt 

thou shall live no long than I will 

but I shall die whether you will or no 

how shall one learn to be content 

unlearn to covet 

Hephestion be I not Alexander I will wish to be Diogenes 

he be dog but discrete I can tell how sharp with a kind of sweetness full of wit yet too too wayward 

Diogenes when I come this way again I will both see thou and confer with thou 

do 

but here come Apelles how now Apelles be Venus face yet finish 

not yet beauty be not so soon shadow who perfection come not within the compass either of cunning or of colour 

well let it rest unperfect and come you with i where I will show you that finish by nature that you have be trifle about by art 

lady I doubt whether there be any colour so fresh that may shadow a countenance so fair 

sir I have think you have be command to paint with your hand not to gloze with your tongue but as I have hear it be the hard thing in paint to set down a hard favour which make you to despair of my face and then shall you have as great thank to spare your labour as to discredit your art 

mistress you neither differ from yourself nor your sex for know your own perfection you seem to dispraise that which man most commend draw they by that mean into a admiration where feed themselves they fall into a ecstasy your modesty be the cause of the one and of the other your affection 

I be too young to understand your speech though old enough to withstand your devise you have be so long use to colour you can do nothing but colour 

Indeed the colour I see I fear will alter the colour I have but come madam will you draw near for Alexander will be here anon Psyllus stay you here at the window if any inquire for i answer non lubet esse domi 

it be always my master fashion when any fair gentlewoman be to be draw within to make i to stay without but if he shall paint jupiter like a bull like a swan like a eagle then must Psyllus with one hand grind colour and with the other hold the candle but let he alone the better he shadow her face the more will he burn his own heart and now if a man can mere with mane who I dare say look as lean as if Diogenes drop out of his nose 

and here come mane who have as much meat in his maw as thou have honesty in thy head 

then I hope thou be very hungry 

they that know thou know that 

but do thou not remember that we have certain liquour to confer withal 

ay but I have business I must go cry a thing 

why what have thou lose 

that which I never have my dinner 

foul lubber will thou cry for thy dinner 

I mean I must cry not as one will say cry but cry that be make a noise 

why fool that be all one for if thou cry thou must needs make a noise 

boy thou be deceive cry have diverse signification and may be allude to many thing knave but one and can be apply but to thou 

profound mane 

we cynic be mad fellow do thou not find I do quip thou 

no very why what be a quip 

we great girder call it a short say of a sharp wit with a bitter sense in a sweet word 

how can thou thus divine divide define dispute and all on the sudden 

wit will have his swing I be bewitch inspire inflame infect 

well then will not I tempt thy gibe spirit 

do not Psyllus for thy dull head will be but a grindstone for my quick wit which if thou whet with overthwart peristi actum est de te I have draw blood at one brain with a bitter bob 

let i cross myself for I die if I cross thou 

let i do my business I myself be afraid lest my wit shall wax warm and then must it needs consume some hard head with fine and pretty jest I be sometime in such a vain that for want of some dull pate to work on I begin to gird myself 

the god shield i from such a fine fellow who word melt wit like wax 

well then let we to the matter in faith my master mean tomorrow to fly 

it be a jest 

be it a jest to fly shall thou fly so soon thou shall repent it in earnest 

well I will be the crier 

o be o be o be all manner of man woman or child that will come to morrow into the market place between the hour of nine and ten shall see Diogenes the cynic fly 

I do not think he will fly 

tush say fly 

fly 

now let we go for I will not see he again till midnight I have a back way into his tub 

which way call thou the backway when every way be open 

I mean to come in at his back 

well let we go away that we may return speedy 

I shall never draw your eye well because they blind i 

why then paint i without eye for I be blind 

be you ever shadow before of any 

no and will you can so now shadow i that I may not be perceive of any 

it be pity but that so absolute a face shall furnish Venus temple among these picture 

what be these picture 

this be Leda who jove deceive in likeness of a swan 

a fair woman but a foul deceit 

this be Alcmene unto who jupiter come in shape of Amphitrion her husband and beget Hercules 

a famous son but a infamous fact 

he may do it because he be a God 

nay therefore it be evil do because he be a God 

this be Danae into who prison jupiter drizzle a golden shower and obtain his desire 

what gold can make one yield to desire 

this be Europa who jupiter ravish this Antiopa 

be all the god like this jupiter 

there be many god in this like jupiter 

I think in those day love be well ratify among man on earth when lust be so full authorize by the god in heaven 

nay you may imagine there be woman pass amiable when there be god exceed amorous 

Were woman never so fair man will be false 

Were woman never so false man will be fond 

what counterfeit be this Apelles 

this be Venus the goddess of love 

what be there also love goddess 

this be she that have power to command the very affection of the heart 

how be she hire by prayer by sacrifice or bribe 

by prayer sacrifice and bribe 

what prayer 

vow irrevocable 

what sacrifice 

heart ever sigh never dissemble 

what bribe 

rose and kiss but be you never in love 

no nor love in i 

then have you injury many 

how so 

because you have be love of many 

flatter perchance of some 

be it not possible that a face so fair and a wit so sharp both without comparison shall not be apt to love 

if you begin to tip your tongue with cunning I pray dip your pencil in colour and fall to that you must do not that you will do 

Parmenio I can tell how it come to pass that in Alexander now a day there grow a unpatient kind of life in the morning he be melancholy at noon solemn at all time either more sour or severe than he be accustom 

in king cause I rather love to doubt then conjecture and think it better to be ignorant then inquisitive they have long ear and stretch arm in who head suspicion be a proof and to be accuse be to be condemn 

yet between we there can be no danger to find out the cause for that there be no malice to withstand it it may be a unquenchable thirst of conquer make he unquiet it be not unlikely his long ease have alter his humour that he shall be in love it be not impossible 

in love Clytus no no it be as far from his thought as treason in we he who ever wake eye who never tire heart who body patient of labour who mind unsatiable of victory have always be note can so soon be melt into the weak conceit of love Aristotle tell he there be many world and that he have not conquer one that gape for all gall Alexander but here he come 

Parmenio and Clitus I will have you both ready to go into Persia about a ambassage no less profitable to i than to yourselves honourable 

we be ready at all command wish nothing else but continual to be command 

well then withdraw yourselves till I have further consider of this matter 
now we will see how Apelles go forward I doubt i that nature have overcome art and her countenance his cunning 

you love and therefore think any thing 

but not so far in love with Campaspe as with Bucephalus if occasion serve either of conflict or of conquest 

occasion can want if will do not behold all Persia swell in the pride of their own power the scythian careless what courage or fortune can do the egyptian dream in the soothsay of their augur and gape over the sinoak of their beast entrails all these Alexander be to be subdue if that world be not slip out of your head which you have swear to conquer with that hand 

I confess the labour fit for Alexander and yet recreation necessary among so many assault bloody wound intolerable trouble give i leave a little if not to sit yet to breath and doubt not but Alexander can when he will throw affection as far from he as he can cowardice but behold Diogenes talk with one at his tub 

one penny Diogenes I be a cynic 

he make thou a beggar that first give thou any thing 

why if thou will give nothing nobody will give thou 

I want nothing till the spring dry and the earth perish 

I gather for the god 

and I care not for those god which want money 

thou be a right cynic that will give nothing 

thou be not that will beg anything 

Alexander king Alexander give a poor cynic a groat 

it be not for a king to give a groat 

then give i a talon 

it be not for a beggar to ask a talon away Apelles 

here 

now gentlewoman do not your beauty put the painter to his trump 

yes my lord see so disorder a countenance he fear he shall shadow a deform counterfeit 

will he can colour the life with the feature and methinks Apelles be you as cunning as report say you be you may paint flower aswell with sweet smell as fresh colour observe in your mixture such thing as shall draw near to their savour 

your majesty must know it be no less hard to paint savour then virtue colour can neither speak nor think 

where do you first begin when you draw any picture 

the proportion of the face in just compass as I can 

I will begin with the eye as a light to all the rest 

if you will paint as you be a king your majesty may begin where you please but as you will be a painter you must begin with the face 

Aurelius will in one hour colour four face 

I marvel in half a hour he do not four 

why be it so easy 

no but he do it so homely 

when will you finish Campaspe 

never finish for always in absolute beauty there be somewhat above art 

why shall not I by labour be as cunning as Apelles 

God shield you shall have cause to be so cunning as Apelles 

methinks four colour be sufficient to shadow any countenance and so it be in the time of Phydias 

then have man few fancy and woman not so many favor for now if the hair of her eye brow be black yet must the hair of her head be yellow the attire of her head must be different from the habit of her body else will the picture seem like the blazon of ancient armoury not like the sweet delight of new find amiableness for as in garden knot diversity of odour make a more sweet savour or as in music diverse string cause a more delicate consent so in paint the more colour the better counterfeit observe black for a ground and the rest for grace 

lend i thy pencil Apelles I will paint and thou shall judge 

here 

the coal break 

you lean too hard 

now it black not 

you lean too soft 

this be awry 

your eye go not with your hand 

now it be worse 

your hand go not with your mind 

nay if all be too hard or soft so many rule and regard that one hand one eye one mind must all draw together I have rather be set of a battle then blot of a board but how have I do here 

like a king 

I think so but nothing more unlike a painter well Apelles Campaspe be finish as I wish dismiss she and bring present she counterfeit after i 

I will 

now Hephestion do not this matter cotton as I will Campaspe look pleasant liberty will increase her beauty and my love shall advance her honour 

I will not contrary your majesty for time must wear out that love have wrought and reason wean what appetite nurse 

how stately she pass by yet how sober a sweet consent in her countenance with a chaste disdain desire mingle with coyness and I can tell how to term it a curse yield modesty 

let she pass 

so she shall for the fair on the earth 

I shall be hang for tarry so long 

I pray God my master be not fly before I come 

away Manes my master do come 

where have you be all this while 

nowhere but here 

who be here sithence my come 

nobody 

ungracious wag I perceive you have be a loiter be Alexander nobody 

he be a king I mean no mean body 

I will cudgel your body for it and then will I say it be nobody because it be no honest body away in 
unfortunate Apelles and therefore unfortunate because Apelles have thou by draw her beauty bring to pass that thou can scarce draw thy own breath and by so much the more have thou increase thy care by how much the more thou have show thy cunning be it not sufficient to behold the fire and warm thou but with Satyrus thou must kiss the fire and burn thou o Campaspe Campaspe art must yield to nature reason to appetite wisdom to affection can Pygmalion entreat by prayer to have his ivory turn into flesh and can Apelles obtain by plaint to have the picture of his love change to life be paint so far inferior to carve or do thou Venus more delight to be hew with chisel then shadow with colour what Pigmalion or what Pyrgoteles or what Lysippus be he that ever make thy face so fair or spread thy fame so far as I unless Venus in this thou envy my art that in colour my sweet Campaspe I have leave no place by cunning to make thou so amiable but alas she be the paramour to a prince Alexander the monarch of the earth have both her body and affection for what be it that king can obtain by prayer threat and promise will not she think it better to sit under a cloth of estate like a queen than in a poor shop like a huswife and esteem it sweet to be the concubine of the lord of the world than spouse to a painter in Athens yes yes Apelles thou may swim against the stream with the crab and feed against the wind with the dear and peck against the steel with the cockatrice star be to be look at not reach at prince to be yield unto not contend with Campaspe to be honour not obtain to be paint not possess of thou oh fair face oh unhappy hand and why do thou draw it so fair a face o beautiful countenance the express image of Venus but somewhat fresh the only pattern of that eternity which jupiter dream of asleep can not conceive again wake blush Venus for I be ashamed to end thou now must I paint thing unpossible for my art but agreeable with my affection deep and hollow sigh sad and melancholy thought wound and slaughter of conceit a life post to death a death gallop from life a waver constancy a unsettle resolution and what not Apelles and what but Apelles but as they that be shake with a fever be to be warm with clothes not groan and as he that melt in a consumption be to be recure by colices not conceit so the feed canker of my care the never die worm of my heart be to be kill by counsel not cry by apply of remedy not by reply of reason and sith in case desperate there must be use medicine that be extreme I will hazard that little life that be leave to restore the great part that be lose and this shall be my first practice for wit must work where authority be not assoon as Alexander have view this portraiture I will by devise give it a blemish that by that mean she may come again to my shop and then as good it be to utter my love and die with denial as conceal it and live in despair 

this be the place the day the time that Diogenes have appoint to fly 

I will not lose the flight of so fair a foul as Diogenes be though my master cudgel my nobody as he threaten 

what Psyllus will the beast wag his wing today 

we shall hear for here come Manes manes will it be 

be he be best be as cunning as a bee or else short he will not be at all 

how be he furnish to fly have he feather 

thou be a ass capon goose and owl have feather he have find Dedalus old waxen wing and have be piece they this month he be so broad in the shoulder o you shall see he cut the air even like a tortoise 

methinks so wise a man shall not be so mad his body must needs be too heavy 

why he have eat nothing this sevennight but cork and feather 

touch he mane 

he be so light that he can scarce keep he from fly at midnight 

see they begin to flock and behold my master bustle himself to fly 

you wicked and bewitch athenian who body make the earth to groan and who breathe infect the air with stench come you to see Diogenes fly Diogenes come to see you sink you call i dog so I be for I long to gnaw the bone in your skin you term mean hater of man no I be a hater of your manner your life dissolute not fear death will prove your death desperate not hope for life what do you else in Athens but sleep in the day and surfeit in the night back god in the morning with pride in the evening belly god with gluttony you flatter king and call they god speak truth of yourselves and confess you be devil from the bee you have take not the honey but the wax to make your religion frame it to the time not to the truth your filthy lust you colour under a courtly colour of love injury abroad under the title of policy at home and secret malice creep under the name of public justice you have cause Alexander to dry up spring and plant vine to sow rocket and weed endive to shear sheep and shrine fox all conscience be seal at Athens swear come of a hot mettle lie of a quick wit flattery of a flow tongue undecent talk of a merry disposition all thing be lawful at Athens either you think there be no god or I must think you be no man you build as though you shall live for ever and surfeit as though you shall die tomorrow none teach true philosophy but Aristotle because he be the king schoolmaster o time oh man oh corruption in manner Remember that green grass must turn to dry hay when you sleep you be not sure to wake and when you rise not certain to lie down look you never so high your head must lie level with your foot thus have I fly over your disorder life and if you will not amend your manner I will study to fly further from you that I may be near to honesty 

thou rave Diogenes for thy life be different from thy word do not I see thou come out of a brothel house be it not a shame 

it be no shame to go out but a shame to go in 

it be a good deed mane to beat thy master 

you be as good eat my master 

have thou make we all fool and wile thou not fly 

I tell thou unless thou be honest I will fly 

dog dog take a bone 

thy father need fear no dog but dog thy father 

we will tell Alexander that thou reprove he behind his back 

and I will tell he that you flatter he before his face 

we will cause all the boy in the street to hiss at thou 

in deed I think the athenian have their child ready for any vice because they be athenian 

why master mean you not to fly 

no mane not without wing 

everybody will account you a liar 

no I warrant you for I will always say the athenian be mischievous 

I care not it be sport enough for i to see these old huddle hit home 

nor I 

Come let we go and hereafter when I mean to raise upon anybody open it shall be give out I will fly 

Campaspe it be hard to judge whether thy choice be more unwise or thy chance unfortunate do thou prefer but stay utter not that in word which make thy ear to glow with thought tush better thy tongue wag than thy heart break have a painter creep further into thy mind then a prince Apelles then Alexander fond wench the baseness of thy mind bewray the meanness of thy birth but alas affection be a fire which kindle aswell in the bramble as in the oak and catch hold where it first light not where it may best burn lark that mount aloft in the air build their nest below in the earth and woman that cast their eye upon king may place their heart upon vassal a needle will become thy finger better than a lute and a distaff be fit for thy hand then a sceptre aunt live safe till they have get wing and juniper be not blow up till it have get a high top the mean estate be without care as long as it continue without pride but here come Apelles in who I will there be the like affection 

gentlewoman the misfortune I have with your picture will put you to some pain to sit again to be paint 

it be small pain for i to sit still but infinite for you to draw still 

no madam to paint Venus be a pleasure but to shadow the sweet face of Campaspe it be a heaven 

if your tongue be make of the same flesh that your heart be your word will be as your thought be but such a common thing it be among you to commend that oftentimes for fashion sake you call they beautiful who you know black 

what may man do to be believe 

whet their tongue on their heart 

so they do and speak as they think 

I will they do 

I will they do not 

why will you have they dissemble 

not in love but their love but will you give i leave to ask you a question without offence 

so that you will answer i another without excuse 

who do you love best in the world 

he that make i last in the world 

that be a God 

I have think it have be a man but who do you honour most Apelles 

the thing that be like you Campaspe 

my picture 

I dare not venture upon your person but come let we go in for Alexander will think it long till we return 

we hear nothing of our embassage a colour belike to blear our eye or tickle our ear or inflame our heart but what do Alexander in the mean season but use for tantara sol fa La for his hard couch down bed for his handful of water his stand cup of wine 

Clytus I mislike this new delicacy and please peace for what else do we see now then a kind of softness in every man mind bee to make their hive in soldier helmet our steed furnish with foot clothes of gold instead of saddle of steel more time to be require to scour the rust of our weapon then there be wont to be in subdue the country of our enemy since Alexander fall from his hard armour to his soft robe behold the face of his court youth that be wont to carry devise of victory in their shield engrave now posy of love in their ring they that be accustom on trot horse to charge the enemy with a lance now in easy coach ride up and down to court lady in steed of sword and target to hazard their life use pen and paper to paint their love yea such a fear and faintness be grow in court that they wish rather to hear the blow of a horn to hunt than the sound of a trumpet to fight o Philip be thou alive to see this alteration thy man turn to woman thy soldier to lover glove wear in velvet cap in steed of plume in grave helmet thou will either die among they for sorrow or confound they for anger 

cease Permenio lest in speak what become thou not thou feel what like thou not truth be never without a scratch face who tongue although it can be cut out yet must it be tie up 

it grieve i not a little for Hephestion who thirst for honour not ease but such be his fortune and nearness in friendship to Alexander that he must lay a pillow under his head when he will put a target in his hand 
but let we draw in to see how well it become they to tread the measure in a dance that be wont to set the order for a march 

I have now Campaspe almost make a end 

you tell i Apelles you will never end 

never end my love for it shall be eternal 

that be neither to have beginning nor end 

you be dispose to mistake I hope you do not mistrust 

what will you say if Alexander perceive your love 

I will say it be no treason to love 

but how if he will not suffer thou to see my person 

then will I gaze continual on thy picture 

that will not feed thy heart 

yet shall it fill my eye beside the sweet thought the sure hope thy protest faith will cause i to embrace thy shadow continual in my arm of the which by strong imagination I will make a substance 

well I must be go but this assure yourself that I have rather be in thy shop grind colour then in Alexander court follow high fortune 
foolish wench what have thou do that alas which can be undo and therefore I fear i undo but content be such a life I care not for abundance o Apelles thy love come from the heart but Alexander from the mouth the love of king be like the blow of wind which whistle sometime gentle among the leaf and straight way turn the tree up by the root or fire which warm afar off and burn near hand or the sea which make man hoist their sail in a flatter calm and to cut their mast in a rough storm they place affection by time by policy by appointment if they frown who dare call they unconstant if bewray secret who will term they untrue if fall to other love who tremble not if he call they unfaithful in king there can be no love but to queen for as near must they meet in majesty as they do in affection it be requisite to stand aloof from king love love and lighten 

now Apelles gather thy wit together Campaspe be no less wise than fair thyself must be no less cunning then faithful it be no small matter to be rival with Alexander 

Apelles you must come away quick with the picture the king think that now you have paint it you play with it 

if I will play with picture I have enough at home 

none perhaps you like so well 

it may be I have paint none so well 

I have know many fair face 

and I many better boy 

I have bring my son Diogenes to be teach of thou 

what can thy son do 

you shall see their quality dance sirrah 

the better the worse 

the music very good 

the musician very bid who only study to have their string in tune never frame their manner to order 

now shall you see the other tumble sirrah 

to see a wag that be bear to break his neck by destiny to practise it by art 

this dog will bite i I will not be with he 

fear not boy dog eat no thistle 

I marvel what dog thou be if thou be a dog 

when I be hungry a mastiff and when my belly be full a spaniel 

do thou believe that there be any god that thou be so dogged 

I must needs believe there be god for I think thou a enemy to they 

why so 

because thou have teach one of thy son to rule his leg and not to follow learning the other to bend his body every way and his mind no way 

thou do nothing but snarl and bark like a dog 

it be the next way to drive away a thief 

now shall you hear the three who sign like a nightingale 

I care not for I have hear a nightingale sing herself 

sing sirrah 

Loe Diogenes I be sure thou can not do so much 

but there be never a thrush but can 

what have thou teach mane thy man 

to be as unlike as may be thy son 

he have teach i to fast lie hard and run away 

how say thou Perim will thou be with he 

ay so he will teach i first to run away 

thou need not be teach thy leg be so nimble 

how say thou Milo will thou be with he 

nay hold your peace he shall not 

why 

there be not room enough for he and i both to tumble in one tub 

well Diogenes I perceive my son brook not thy manner 

I think no less when they know my virtue 

farewell Diogenes thou need not have scrape root if thou will have follow Alexander 

nor thou have follow Alexander if thou have scrape root 

I fear i Apelles that thy eye have blab that which thy tongue dare not what little regard have thou while Alexander view the counterfeit of Campaspe thou stand gaze on her countenance if he espy or but suspect thou must needs twice perish with his hate and thy own love thy pale look when he blush thy sad countenance when he smile thy sigh when he question may breed in he a jealousy perchance a frenzy o love I never before know what thou be and now haste thou make i that I know not what myself be only this I know that I must endure intolerable passion for unknown pleasure dispute not the cause wretch but yield to it for better it be to melt with desire then wrestle with love cast thyself on thy careful bed be content to live unknown and die unfound o Campaspe I have paint thou in my heart paint nay contrary to my art imprint and that in such deep character that nothing can raze it out unless it rub thy heart out 

it shall go hard but this peace shall bring we some pleasure 

down with arm and up with leg this be a world for the nonce 

sweet youth if you know what it be to save your sweet blood you will not so foolish go about to spend it what delight can there be in gash to make foul scar in fair face and crooked maim in straight leg as though man be bear goodly by nature will of purpose become deform by folly and all forsooth for a new find term call valiant a word which breed more quarrel than the sense can commendation 

it be true lay a featherbed have no fellow good drink make good blood and shall pelt word spill it 

I mean to enjoy the world and to draw out my life at the wiredrawer not to curtail it off at the cutler 

you may talk of war speak big conquer world with great word but stay at home where in steed of alarm you shall have dance for hot battle with fierce man gentle skirmish with fair woman these pewter coat can never sit so well as satin doublet believe i you can conceive the pleasure of peace unless you despise the rudeness of war 

it be so but see Diogenes pry over his tub Diogenes what say thou to such a morsel 

I say I will spit it out of my mouth because it shall not poison my stomach 

thou speak as thou be it be no meat for dog 

I be a dog and philosophy rate i from carrion 

uncivil wretch who manner be answerable to thy calling the time be thou will have have my company have it not be as thou say too dear 

I remember there be a thing that I repent i of and now thou haste tell it indeed it be too dear of nothing and thou dear to nobody 

down villain or I will have thy head break 

will you couch 

avaunt cur come sweet lay let we go to some place and possess peace but first let we sing there be more pleasure in tune of a voice then in a volley of shot 

now let we make haste lest Alexander find we here 

methinks Hephestion you be more melancholy than you be accustom but I perceive it be all for Alexander you can neither brook this peace nor my pleasure be of good cheer though I wink I sleep not 

melancholy I be not nor well content for I know not how there be such a rust creep into my bone with this long ease that I fear I shall not scour it out with infinite labour 

yes yes if all the travail of conquer the world will set either thy body or i in tune we will undertake they but what think you of Apelles do you ever see any so perplex he neither answer direct to any question nor look steadfast upon any thing I hold my life the painter be in love 

it may be for common we see it incident in artificer to be enamour of their own work as Archidamus of his wooden dove Pygmalion of his ivory image Arachne of his wooden swan especial painter who play with their own conceit now covet to draw a glance eye than a roll now a wink still mend it never end it till they be catch with it and then poor soul they kiss the colour with their lip with which before they be loath to taint their finger 

I will find it out page go speedy for Apelles will he to come hither and when you see we earnest in talk sudden cry out Apelles shop be on fire 

it shall be do 

forget not your lesson 

I marvel what your device shall be 

the event shall prove 

I pity the poor painter if he be in love 

pity he not I pray thou that severe gravity set aside what do you think of love 

as the macedonian do of their herb beet which look yellow in the ground and black in the hand think it better see than touch 

but what do you imagine it to be 

a word by superstition think a God by use turn to a humour by self will make a flatter madness 

you be too hard heart to think so of love let we go to Diogenes Diogenes thou may think it somewhat that Alexander come to thou again so soon 

if you come to learn you can not come soon enough if to laugh you be come too soon 

it will better become thou to be more courteous and frame thyself to please 

and you better to is less if you dare displease 

what do thou think of the time we have here 

that we have light be and lose much 

if one be sick what will thou have he do 

be sure that he make not his physician his heir 

if thou may have thy will how much ground will content thou 

as much as you in the end must be content withal 

what a world 

no the length of my body 

Hephestion shall I be a little pleasant with he 

you may but he will be very perverse with you 

it skill not I can be angry with he Diogenes I pray thou what do thou think of love 

a little worse than I can of hate 

and why 

because it be better to hate the thing which make to love than to love the thing which give occasion of hate 

why be not woman the best creature in the world 

next man and bee 

what do thou dislike chief in a woman 

one thing 

what 

that she be a woman 

in my opinion thou be never bear of a woman that thou think so hardly of woman but not come Apelles who I be sure be as far from thy thought as thou be from his cunning Diogenes I will have thy cabin remove near to my court because I will be a philosopher 

and when you have do so I pray you remove your court further from my cabin because I will not be a courtier 

but here come Apelles Apelles what piece of work have you now in hand 

none in hand if it like your majesty but I be devise a platform in my head 

I think your hand put it in your head be it nothing about Venus 

no but some thing about Venus 

Apelles Apelles look about you your shape be on fire 

ay i if the picture of Campaspe be burn I be undo 

stay Apelles no haste it be your heart be on fire not your shop and if camp hang there I will she be burn but have you the picture of Campaspe belike you love she well that you care not though all be lose so she be safe 

not love she but your majesty know that painter in their last work be say to excel themselves and in this I have so much please myself that the shadow as much delight i be a artificer as the substance do other that be amorous 

you lay your colour gross though I can not paint in your shop I can spy into your excuse be not ashamed Apelles it be a gentleman sport to be in love call hither Campaspe methinks I may have be make privy to your affection though my counsel have not be necessary yet my countenance may have be think requisite but Apelles forsooth love under hand yea and under Alexander nose and but I say no more 

Apelles love not so but he live to do as Alexander will 

Campaspe here be news Apel be in love with you 

it please your majesty to say so 

Hephestion I will try she to Campaspe for the good quality I know in Apelles and the virtue I see in you I be determine you shall enjoy one the other how say you Campaspe will you say I 

your handmaid must obey if you command 

think you not Hephestion that she will fain be command 

I be no thought catcher but I guess unhappy 

I will not enforce marriage where I can compel love 

but your majesty may move a question where you be willing to have a match 

Hephestion these party be agree they will have i both priest and witness Apelles take Campaspe why move you not Campaspe take Apelles will it not be if you be ashamed one of the other by my consent you shall never come together but dissemble not Campaspe do you love Apelles 

pardon my lord I love Apelles 

Apelles it be a shame for you be love so open of so fair a virgin to say the contrary do you love Campaspe 

only Campaspe 

two love worm Hephestion I perceive Alexander can subdue the affection of man though he conquer their country love fall like dew aswell upon the low grass as upon the high cedar spark have their heat ant their gall fly their spleen well enjoy one another I give she thou frank Apelles thou shall see that Alexander make but a toy of love and lead affection in setter use fancy as a fool to make he sport or as a minstrel to make he merry it be not the amorous glance of a eye can settle a idle thought in the heart no no it be child game a life for seamster and scholar the one prick in clout have nothing else to think on the other pick fancy out of book have little else to marvel at go Apelles take with you your Campaspe Alexander be cloy with look on that which thou wonder at 

thank to your majesty on bend knee you have honour Apelles 

thank with bow heart you have bless Campaspe 

page go warn Clitus and Parmenio and the other lord to be in a readiness let the trumpet sound strike up the drum and I will present into Persia how now Hephestion be Alexander able to resist love as he lift 

the conquer of Thebes be not so honourable as the subdue of these thought 

it be a shame Alexander shall desire to command the world if he can not command himself but come let we go I will try whether I can better bear my hand with my heart than I can with my eye and good Hephestion when all the world be win and every country be thou and i either find i out another to subdue or of my word I will fall in love
