what felicity can man have more than in i 
wherein ought he to have more joy and consolation 
what thing will make his conscience more quiet to be 
then to study that thing which be his salvation 
I pass all the science it need small probation 
and if you be desirous my name for to know 
Theology I be call the knowledge of God law 
but who do not study i chief for lucre and gain 
and also thereby to have rich and easy live 
but who to preach poor in study i be fain 
and thereby to salvation the sinful wretch to bring 
nay they have rather to be pay here then to abide god reward 
but such do not remember or believe Daniel 
say the convert of a soul shall shine above the angel 
so many will not study i but for money 
and thereby to live lordly and in wealth 
the bishop the priest and the doctor of divinity 
will give over their study not regard their soul health 
and use some other thing for as it appear 
the artificer do leave his art and occupy 
and become a minister for money and easy live 
such as do study have live by i 
ought to be a lantern and a spectacle to other 
whereby they may be allure all sinfulness to fly 
but many of they do use a unchristianly order 
for money they will handle full cruel their neighbour 
be not this a hindrance to the knowledge of God word 
without they amend God will strike they with his sword 

many do embrace and study i daily 
but will you know why and also to what end 
forsooth for great live and also for money 
not to help the needy therewith they do intend 
but vain on their carcase to consume and spend 
and the rest to revenge malice wicked they do spare 
thus to live at pleasure be their delight and care 
but the most part care not for i neither i regard 
so much they be lead with the blind love of money 
vile money before science and knowledge be prefer 
all good science and knowledge I represent true 
which do heal the mind as medicine do the body 
quemadmodum corpus medicina sic animum curate philosophia 
et vita sine literis mors est & hominis sepultura 
what worthy theology I be glad to see you hear 
he must needs confess you be my head and pear 
for as man through i have necessary live 
even so both body and soul to heavenly joy you bring 

 your argument from i do not much disagree 
for nothing be almost do unless it be for money 
for the wicked rich man and the lover of money 
regard but for gain neither you nor i 
Terence the unlearned brief describe 
homine imperito nunquam iniustius 
qui nisi quod ipse fecit nihil rectum putat 
so they have money they care not for we a gnate 

art bonae ubique sunt in praecio nec possunt à fortuna eripi 
good art be everywhere esteem and have in price 
and can not be take away by fortune true 
my name be call art wherein be use much vice 
all occupation and art which daily now be wrought 
by i be represent throughout the whole earth 
every one for money i daily have seek 
and all for private gain as plain appear 
who do embrace i thereby to suppress death 
for a common wealth few use i in deed 
and to bring up their household godly and the poor to feed 
what husband man be he that abate the price of corn 
nay he rather buy and keep his own in store 
many merchant man that be right simple bear 
with unsatiable gain increase more and more 
he will not abate his price for help of the poor 
who will not prevent his neighbour with buy thing over his head 
all this be for money so that love and charity be dead 
but do I not see here the most worthy theology 
and also science and knowledge next he in degree 

 to we you be welcome art most necessary 
no good order in the land can be without we three 

 even as I at the first lament the inordinate love 
of money which now of every one be esteem 
the same to be too true you both I have hear prove 
o judas judas thereby thyself thou have damn 
thou have be better money never have handle 
and also such as have have in money their consolation 
without the mercy of God shall have everlasting damnation 

 dives vix bone a pretty say and true 
the rich man be scant good this be the meaning 
and money make pleasure this sentence do show 
pecunia effectrix multarum & magnarum voluptatum 

 and again it be write the second de finibus 
pecunia voluptatis perimitur maximae 
the meaning whereof I may thus discuss 
most great pleasure be bring forth for money 
then if money bring pleasure pleasure bring forth sin 
and sin bring damnation unless God grace we win 

 well see every one be so far out of frame 
and give themselves so much to the love of money 
let we walk as we ought in praise God name 
beseech God to send they his favour and mercy 
oh lord bless thy people from everlasting misery 
Christ have but twelve apostle and one betray his master 
even judas the bag carrier for money he play the traitor 

 accord to your godly will I be content likewise 
let we not with money commit oh lord any vice 

 and as you both have say I be please therewith 
oh lord keep thy people in thy faith love and truth 

hoyghe hoyghe for money more sweet than honey 
who will not for i take pain 
each lord and knight for i will fight 
and hazard to be slay 
I wax of such force that no earthly corpse 
but embrace i out of measure 
the doctor the draper the ploughman the carter 
in i have their joy and pleasure 
money be my name all over be my fame 
I dwell with every degree 
though great be their live yet can they do nothing 
without the presence of i 
many for my sake work while their heart ache 
yet never think themselves weary 
the smith and the shoemaker the minstrel the dancer 
with i will drink and be merry 
but the churl and the covetous of i be so jealous 
that I can not get out of their sight 
but the serve man the spender the usurer and the lender 
do send i abroad day and night 
I be worship and honour and as a god be esteem 
yea many love i better than God 
no soon come I to town but many bow down 
and come if I hold up the rod 
what need I further show that every one do know 
I do but waste my wind 
for servant and prentice will privy rob their master 
to i they have such a mind 

 o worthy money thy absence have be long 
my sorrow in thy absence can not be speak with tongue 
for you money be only the pain I do take 
will I flatter or dissemble unless it be for your sake 
 what adulation or flattery more welcome to i 

than any man this month that I do hear or see 
a true saying no doubt blandiloquio nihil nocentim 
then fair speak or flattery nothing be more pernicious 
Nemo svam turpitudinem perspicit sed sibi cuique adulator est 
no man to see his filthiness be press 
but every one to himself be a very flatterer 
and thou will flatter also to have money for thy labour 

 do you think I will flatter or fain any man 
unless for your sake nay beshrew i then 
such as love themselves and love their own way best 
must needs be flatter therein and then they be at rest 
they must be hold up and flatter in their evil 
and for you I care not how many I send to the devil 

 oh what pain be this that I feel at my heart 
my pain be as great as though I be smite with a dart 
what ail i what ail i thus sudden to be sick 
I think I shall die without remedy of physic 

 be of good cheer sir of this I be sure 
you can die so long as the world do endure 
Come hither mischievous help money be almost dead 
come quick in the mischief and help to hold his head 

 what need you call thus hasty unless you have more need 
money may be sick but he will never be dead 
but to help at a mischief I be as quick as the best 
oh my lord and master to help you I be press 
 welcome mischievous help I be never so sick before 

help to hold my stomach I swell now more and more 
I must either vomit or else I shall burst in two 
what wicked disease be this that trouble i so 

 none can make i believe it be any thing else 
but pleasure the occasion that thus your belly swell 
you be so fraught with pleasure that I do perfect know 
you will never be in quiet till he be rid from your maw 
therefore provoke yourself to vomit he quick 
and than you will be at quiet even by and by 

 now I believe true that pleasure be the occasion 
of all my great sickness malady and passion 
therefore as thou have say certain and true it be 
for money bring all pleasure that any can wish 
now I will assay to vomit if I can 
therefore either of you play now the pretty man 

 let he hold your head and I will hold your stomach 
and I hope with speed you shall have very good luck 
I hope he be come for I feel he at my throat 

great sorrow pain and grief it be to i god wot 
I will not for all the world be in such pain again 
as many as love i of he will be glad and fain 

 I must needs take money for the father of i pleasure 
the most part I be sure will love i out of measure 

 well my son well forget not to do thy feat 
I must needs get i hence my pain do make i sweat 

 money be to i such a sure friend 
that see he be go I will not tarry behind 

 in what case be the world be it not for money 
without joy and pleasure better be dead then alive 
to live like dome god who will not be weary 
to satisfy man nature with pleasure I can contrive 
but I contain they at this time and hour 
hawk and hunt shout and fish 
eat and drink dice and card 
ride and run swim and sing 
dance and leap with all kind of play 
banquet with fine meat and wine of all sort 
dally with fair woman with other kind of sport 
all fine apparel that make the heart joy 
with musical instrument both with man and boy 
thus no sport or joy wherein man have solace 
but I do contain they though money bring they to pass 

 you say true pleasure no tongue can express 
what comfort and joy in you contain be 

what thing be this that make i thus to swell 
I promise you even now I be perfect well 
I be in a strange case whatever the matter be 
there be no other way but short I must die 

 there will none believe I dare ioberd my hand 
that pleasure shall die so long as the world do stand 
therefore take no care nor yet lament or moan 
for sudden it come and sudden it will be go 

 I be never able to abide it if it last long 
I fry in my fit the pain be so strong 

 even as you be the occasion of the sickness of your father 
so be your son sin to you I be sure 
so that you will I think be soon ease of your pain 
if you can avoid sin from you by any mean 

 none in the world I think can guess better 
for as money be to i even so be I sin father 
therefore to be at ease and to be rid of that lobber 
help now all my friend for love of money and pleasure 

 I can choose but help you have so conjure we now 
for money and pleasure none but will take pain I trow 
he be not worthy to live I make god a vow 
that will not work his heart out for both you 

 oh help help quick I never stand in more need 
I be so full of sin I shall burst without quick speed 

I be afraid of nothing but only of my dagger 
lest in the time of my birth it will have stick my father 
and then for my grandfather few will have care 
if you my father pleasure have be slay or kill 
yea marry sir now my think I be more at liberty 
I can not once turn i in my father belly 
my father need not care in what company he do eat 
I have make his throat so wide he can not be choke with meat 

 although my pain be great yet now I may be glad 
that I have to my son such a pretty fine lad 

 if I be now a lad what be you then 
a boy of my age will never make man 
and although I be young yet be I well grow 
no child of six year old be so big in all this town 

 well my son sin accord to thy nature and name 
all that love money and i see that you do frame 
to all sinful live and all other wickedness 
I need not bid thou for I know well thy goodness 

 I have ever to you pleasure bear such love 
that to depart with you my heart do i move 

 he have as much need to bid i do this 
as to make a dog hold up his leg when he do piss 
and as sin be the child of pleasure in every nation 

Even so my son and heir be endless damnation 
 by the mass I care not what sin I commit 
so that thereby I may purchase pleasure and profit 
it be a hard thing that I will not do for money 
I will cut my father throat if I may get money thereby 

 that be my boy that I need not teach thou more 
or ever he have money he commit sin before 
out alas master what thing be in my belly 
such pain as these will quick make i weary 
who who be able to abide this grief or pain 
even now in my belly but now in my reins 
now in my buttock and now at my heart 
the pain be so great that I suffer grievous smart 
I hold twenty pound it will turn to the gout 
even now at my heart and now at the sole of my foot 
out alas my neck my side and my back 
out alas my head asunder begin to crack 

 I pray you sin be quiet and be content a while 
for I do think very yourself you do beguile 
your pain be none other I dare be bold to say 
but only damnation whereof you be so full 
therefore to avoid he you must take pain to assay 
and to help you therein with all my power I will 
do not make such moan sin for your child damnation 
be the only occasion of all your grief and passion 

 the whoreson head be so great and he so ill favour make 
that I must needs be rip I be great afraid 

 be content sin I will call for more aid 
ho swift to sin come away in haste 
sin be so sick I be afraid he will burst 

 even as your grandfather do and your father by you also 
we will have with speed your son damnation I trow 

 that ill favour knave be like none of we 
no more than a sow to a cow or a sheep to a goose 
now for a midwife I will give twenty pound 
hold i up sir for now I begin to sound 

it be the heavy lobber that ever man do bear 
they say sin be heavy but he be heavy I swear 
how say you master be not this a well favour baby 
that I sin have bring forth so painful 
he be the worst favouredst knave that ever be bear 
it must needs be good ground that bring forth such good corn 
when I look on he methinks he to be to evil favour 
yet the crow think her black bird of all other the fair 
but I can not love he if I shall be hang 
thou be never like son of i to be kiss 

 I be fearful damnation through sin procreate 
to such as in sin have all their felicity 
and die without repentance I shall be annex 
but the repentant sinner that obtain god mercy 
shall enjoy the heaven far separate from i 
therefore father sin to thou be due honour 
that in bring forth of i thou take such pain and labour 

 in faith much good do it you and they to who you shall be marry 
I wis they be better marry a sow that her pig have new farrow 

 now farewell sin of i you stand no more in need 
do but beck when you lack i and I will come with all speed 

 in your necessity I be glad that we be here 
I can be long out of your company I swear 

 fare well most sweet father I be loath to depart 
so soon to be trudge it grieve i at the heart 

 now fair evil most sour soon to be sorry I can choose 
your go grieve i so much that the snot drop out of my nose 
have I not see and feel the bear of he myself 
I will have think sure he have be some changeling or else 
happy be they that be match with my son damnation 
they be better lie all their life in a dungeon or prison 
he be so sure a companion as I know but few 
who happen once in his company shall it never eschew 
my grandfather money have hatch a goodly litter 
a honest kindred can nowhere be find 
pleasure sin and damnation of all other most bitter 
who do not love we that with the love of money be drown 
none but be my servant that live and tread on ground 
the great power that be the low state of all 
to be my servant can not choose and also still shall 
and be it any marvel why I so many servant have 
none with fine quality with i can compare 
therefore in my sight every one be but a slave 
what of with your cap sir it become you to stand bare 
none can forswear themselves in trade for ware 
no pick of purse can be at market or fair 
no theft or robbery no murder or kill 
can be without i ne yet whoredom or swear 
no pride no sloth no gluttony can be use 
no perjury without i neither envy nor hatred 
as my quality be good so my personage be proper 
I be neither too high nor too low to great nor so small 
no thick no thin no short no long 
they decent appertain as you may see all 
if I be high I be the worst to fall 
if I be low they will take i for a boy 
therefore to behold my person you can not choose but joy 

 oh oh oh oh my friend sin I be never so merry 
in hear thy quality I can not be weary 
in thy genealogy sin I do more rejoice 
then can be think with heart or speak with tongue or voice 
but my chief comfort be thy son man damnation 
whereby they be exclude from eternal salvation 

 why you evil fast knave how come your friendship in 
they be well favour babe that be of your kin 

 oh sin oh to see thou it do i good 
thy word sin oh thy word do comfort my heart blood 
through money and pleasure my kingdom do increase 
therefore to be merry why shall I cease 

 then I and my son damnation be nobody with you 
sin and damnation belike bring a man to heaven 
be thy kingdom diminish through we think thou 
you bottle nose knave I will see your nose even 
I wis you have be as good to have set i in the number 
I do not so much pleasure you but I will work you as much cumber 
for I do never increase thy kingdom so much before 
but now I will diminish it twenty time more 
how can money and pleasure bring man unto hell 
without sin and damnation sir good face i tell 
nay I will be go I will tarry no long here 
I will turn all your mirth into sorrowful cheer 

 I know I will make he soon change his note 
I will make he sing the black sanctus I hold he a groat 

 oh my friend sin do not leave i thus 
for without thou and thou own son damnation 
my kingdom will decay through my ancient enemy jesus 
for without man company I can have no consolation 
all have be my own but for Christ death and passion 
therefore without thy help and thy son damnation 
without company in hell I shall for ever make my moan 

 you may laugh well enough that sin and the devil be fall out 
but we will fall in again or ever it be long 
stand back in the mischief or I will hit you on the snout 
it be high time that you have end your song 

 come hither my son gluttony and pride 
persuade my friend sin with i to stick and abide 

our lord and master I pray you turn back again 
our father can not be merry if you his company refrain 
thou can thy lery pope to call i lord and master 
for I be thy chief head and thou be of i a member 

 I pray thou for our sake once back again to turn 
for thy depart will cause he still to mourn 

 thou thy dog and cat thou evil favour knave 
use i so again and your nose from your face I will have 

 we pray you most hearty to forgive that be past 
and we never hereafter will misuse you again 
if you forsake our father for sorrow he will brace 
therefore from your fury we hope you will abstain 

 of all the three devil thou have the most manner 
for thy sake once again I will comfort thy father 
snottynose Sathanas disable i no more 
lest you have more ado than you have before 
well Satan kingdom by i shall be increase 
and through my son damnation that it shall never be empty 

 I will not have you to take all the pain alone 
I myself will entice many to pride 
that in hell our habitation they continual may groan 
to help you at all time I will be at your side 

 and I will allure they to fine fare and gluttony 
that their delight may be fill the belly 
early up at drink and late up at banquet 
so that all their joy shall be in drunkenness and surfeit 
they shall spend on their own belly more than shall suffice 
but the poor from their door hungry shall arise 

 oh oh oh my babe my chicken and my friend sin 
many one through thou the kingdom of hell shall win 
oh for joy and gladness I can not stand or sit 
upon these cheerful word I must needs dance a fit 

 yea but one thing snotty nose will be very hard 
where shall we get a pipe to play the devil a galliard 

 before you turn back I do both cry and weep 
but now through thy comfort I can dance without a pipe 
I do now perceive money be so belove 
that of many above god he be esteem and honour 
and the world be give so much to delicacy and pleasure 
that sin and damnation increase out of measure 

 we give you most hearty thanks oh sin our master 
who return again have comfort our father 

 if you have not return for aught we can have do 
our father without doubt will have fall in a swoon 

 if the devil have die who shall have be his heir 

 no my friend no none can possess my chair 
for as God be without end and his joy endless 
even so be I king of everlasting darkness 

 now if they be wise they will care for no such a friend 
to procure they to pain that never shall have end 

 even as the joy of heaven do pass all other pleasure 
even so the pain of hell exceed all other be sure 
the great torment and pain that be on the earth 
be joy and pleasure in respect of pain of hell 
the scripture make mention thereof as plain appear 
there be gnaw and gnash of tooth as the damn shall tell 

 much good do it you snotty nose I long not for your cheer 
I beshrew you and your babe if thereof you spare 
it be better be poor and after in heaven to dwell 
then to be rich on the earth and after live in hell 

 well let we talk no more of the pain and sorrow 
but see we be prepare in that place to dwell 
let we take pain both even and morrow 
to enlarge our dominion the kingdom of hell 
I be so esteem throughout the world wide 
that they have rather dwell in hell then lay i aside 

 and I begin with many to be in such favour 
that the preacher can not allure they what so he do say 
in their throat and belly be all their joy and pleasure 
no whit regard the last fearful day 

 as either of you contain one sin particular 
even so I contain all sin general 
therefore goodman snotty nose if you reward i well 
I and my son damnation shall send enough to hell 

 whatsoever thou will have I will not thou deny 

 then give i a piece of thy tail to make a flap for a fly 
for if I have a piece thereof I do very believe 
the humble bee sting shall never i grieve 

 no my friend no my tail I can not spare 
but ask what thou will beside and I will it prepare 

 then your nose I will have to stop my tail behind 
for I be cumber with colic and let out of wind 
and if it be too little to make thereof a case 
than I will be so bold to borrow your face 

 now I perceive well you be dispose to be merry 
but ask i any thing that be meet for to give 
and in satisfy you thereof I will not tarry 
to make you my chief officer it will not i grieve 
sure you be thereof you may i believe 
beside if any friend of you of i do stand in steed 
the best thing in hell shall be his in his need 

 woe be to my friend if they stand need of you 
or any thing you have in that most pleasant place 
I will not wish that friendship to either horse or cow 
for there they shall be sure of small favour or grace 
be not here master think you a amiable face 
happy may they be which with he shall dwell always 
but thrice happy than which godly end their day 

 now my friend sin see I have see you 
take here my blessing and so I bid thou adieu 

 be not they think you of all other most happy 
which shall for ever and ever be in the devil company 
it be better be a posthorse that rest night nor day 
or else to be a galley slave then with the devil to play 
well I be sure I have yet much to do 
for if my father pleasure have much work in hand 
I must needs travail through every land 
I can not well tell what thing to do first 
my head be so full of toy wherewith I think it will burst 
if I go to my grandfather first than my father will be angry 
and if I see my father before I see my son 
than he will take the matter I tell you sorrowful 
therefore give i counsel what be best to be do 
if I shall go to my grandfather where shall I find he 
in the poor man purse he do seldom abide 
but in the beggar cloak I may chance to have he 
I shall not find where he be unless I have a guide 
I be a wise young man that fear to find money 
in the covetous churl coffer I shall have he by and by 
I be sure to find he at the goldsmith stall 
if there I miss he I shall never find he at all 

 who may be compare to i in degree 
who be more happy than learning with money 
learn at the first to riches i prefer 
and money be the cause that I be now honour 
learn with money I be of all man call 
who be not desirous my favour to win 
for my money and riches my learning be esteem 
very few or none but at my table have be 
the learned Seneca these word have express 
iners malorum remedium ignorantia est 
then if you counterpoise i learning with money 
of all evil and mischief I be the best remedy 

learning may aswell counsel where money do want 
but riches cause the common sort to esteem counsel best 
for if a rich man well apparel have a fine tongue to descant 
he shall be take for learned though he know never a letter 
my learning as good as you I dare be bold to compare 
yet there be great difference between our estimation 
but if your attire as i be be course and as bare 
than he shall be best esteem that have best condition 
my name be learn without money in poor degree god wot 
I have not to help my need either penny or groat 
and though I have no money at this time present 
yet I thank God through my knowledge and learning 
I ever have enough wherewith I be content 
so that contentation make i as rich as a king 
the difference between our two live be this only 
you live idle in pleasure and I in study take pain 
which you can not away with but think it a misery 
but if with labour I have sufficient I be right glad and fain 
who will not be content with poverty to have sufficient gain 
Surely to live godly with poverty I have rather 
than be damn in sin with continual pleasure 
 I will not say but that riches be a great occasion 

that we do live wanton and out of God fear 
but learning do cause we to bridle our affection 
therefore learning rule my riches everywhere 

 who so be rich do fall into many annoysome lust 
but the godly poor always in God do put his trust 
if you do rule your good and bestow they as you ought 
few fellow you have as I by proof have try 
of many learned rich I crave but can get nought 
but the poor sort unlearned have give i to feed 
many that be learned and riches have withal 
be more out of frame then some who nothing have at all 
their learning make they think with their riches to be so strong 
that they will oppress their neighbour be it never so wrong 

 well if you lack live be bold to come to i 
for I can be content to bestow where be need 
and especial upon such as godly learn be 
I thank God I have wherewith the poor to feed 
what learn with money I be glad to see you here 
I stand need of your counsel in diverse case 
wherefore if you will help i I will recompense you I swear 
I have many froward matter in hand in sundry place 
I have money enough to defend i in maugre their face 
many beggarly knave have good matter against i 
but here be one will do well enough my old friend money 

 cuique sva ducitur natura as here it may appear 
for the evil be wrought by the instrument accord to nature 
this man be give natural to oppress the poor 
and money be the instrument that make he so bold 
many be give natural to consume in keep a whore 
some natural in drink to spend their gold 
nihil est tam munitum quod auro non expugnetur 
thou think thou lack nothing see thou be full of treasure 
who in marry their child have any respect 
to learning and honesty but only to riches 
nay the one they do embrace the other they neglect 
well hereof a pretty answer be make by Themistocles 
one ask he whether it be better his daughter to marry 
to a rich man not honest or to a honest poor man 
and he answer again both quick and wise 
ego inquit malim virum qui pecunia quàm quae egeat viro pecunia 
I have rather say he to have if I can 
a man that lack money than money that lack a man 

 what prattle fellow be this that be so talkative 
it seem he be learn but yet he can not thrive 

 yea sure he be learned of who it be great pity 
he have no certain live nor yet any money 

 in faith then he may dance among beggar well enough 
thou be best give up thy learning and help to hold the plunge 

 do you set so little by my knowledge and learning 
 who will esteem thou unless thou have live 

 the example of the philosopher may well be apply 
that kiss his gown for come into the emperor chamber 

this gentleman of thou shall not be esteem 
unless he have riches if thy word may be believe 
for even now thou say I be not deaf of hear 
who will esteem i unless I have a live 
there be none other difference between this gentleman and i 
but that he do abound in riches and I in poverty 

 believe he not sir for you be ever a good gentleman 
if you stand need of i you shall find i your friend 
there be nothing but I will do it for you if I can 
nay try i when you list you shall i faithful find 

 as long as he need not thou will help he at a inch 
but if in poverty he fall than friendship will quench 
for it be the nature of the churlish rich man 
to be friend to such as of he stand no need 
but if his riches fail farewell friendship than 
he will not then bid he with he once to feed 
if I have your estate sir by proof you shall see 
all the crouch you have have shall then be do to i 

 your wise word have bring this sentence to mind 
write in terrio tusculanorum where you may it find 
omnes cum secundae tum maximè secum meditari oporter quo pacto aduersam aerumnam ferant 
it be meet for all man when they be in prosperity 
to meditate how to suffer trouble in adversity 

 if you mark it as well as here you have it place 
they will be the less grievous to you come they never so fast 
I promise you I will not change my estate with this man live 

to have his riches and money for my knowledge and learning 
 marry I be agree I intend not to change it 

to make such a bargain I be out of my wit 
 I have in my learning more perfect consolation 
than thou have or can have in all thy gold and riches 
for I may carry it with i in any country or nation 
and the more I spend thereof the more it will increase 
but the more thou spend the more it do diminish 
thus no man that hear we but may perceive well 
that my learning thy riches and treasure do excel 

 I may carry money enough with i wherever I go 
which will i help and succour both in well and woe 
 you can not carry your money but it must needs consume 

and perhaps be steal or lose before it be half do 
many one of their money as they have travail 
have be spoil some hurt therefore and some also murder 

 I can have meat and drink in every place for money 
but if I have none at all I shall go to bed hungry 

 for that I be partaker with either of you both 
to disallow any of you I will be very loath 
but learn before riches ought to be prefer 
although the most part money more regard 

 I be the better esteem as every one do know 
I be take for a honest man wherever I go 
and he shall be for a abject rascal and slave 
to who each one will say pack hence thou beggarly knave 

 some that do not know i perhaps will say so 
but where I be know I trust my usage be such 
that they be very sorry when thus I do go 
and when I come again of i they make much 
but thou among thy neighbour be so belove 
and though they flatter thou for fear to thy face 
they will curse thou assoon as thy back from they be turn 
and call thou canker churl in every place 

 I will I know they which speak such word of i 
they be but beggarly knave I dare lay a wager 
I will hoist they at the next term and they shall not know why 
then shall you see the villain begin to crouch and flatter 
but yet for all that my money and my riches 
get i all the pleasure I can desire or wish 

 these word of pleasure be write by Cato 
malorum esca voluptas qua homines capiuntur ut pisces hamo 
pleasure be the meat of evil man thus mean the text and book 
wherewith man be catch as fish with the hook 
and again he have write read the same who list 
nulla capitalior pestis quam corporis voluptas hominibus à natura data est 
there be no great plague give to man by nature 
then be of the body the desire or pleasure 

 and Sallust in few word thereof write thus 
in regno voluptatis virtuti non est locus 
in the kingdom of pleasure there be no place for virtue 
for pleasure bring loathsomeness as Pliny do show 
nulla est adeo quae non assiduitate svi fastidium pariat voluptas 

no pleasure but with much use bring loathsomeness 
 nay that be not true for the more money I have 
the more I desire so god i help and save 

 Juvenalis word herein do thou right hit 
crescit amor nummi quantum ipsa pecunia crescit 
the love of money increase as much as money itself 
to what mischief bring we this vile and wicked pelf 
money make no man rich unless there be contentation 
but the poor man content be rich I say 
as in ultimo paradoxo I find a good probation 
contentum svis rebus esse maximae sunt certissimaeque divitiae 
the most great and certain riches that be 
have he that be content with that which be his 
therefore thou be most poor as I may well define 
for thou be not content with that which be thou 
egens est qui non satis habet and be cvi nihil satis potest esse 
he be poor that have not enough or who nothing will satisfy 
and in primo paradoxo thou be trim paint 
and such as thou be as be never satisfy 
nunquam expletur nec satiatur cupiditatis sitis 
neque solum ea quae habent libidine augendi cruciantur sed etiam amittendi metu 
the thirst of desire be never satisfy nor fill 
and these good they have to increase their desire 
whereby they be not only grievous torment 
but also to lose they they have as great a fear 

 Horace do verify your say I be sure 
say crescentem pecuniam cura sequitur 
and eloquent Cicero say in this phrase 
virtuti qui pra diti sunt soli sunt divites 
they be only rich that with virtue be adorn 
so that without virtue a man can not be enrich 
be it not for my learning I shall be more covetous 
therefore learning be to be prefer before any thing 
literae pulcherrimae sunt divitiae hominis 
the most fair riches of man be knowledge and learning 

 open eiusmodi parandae quae navi fracta simul cum dno quaeant enatare 
these riches of man be chief to be get 
which may swim to land with his master when the ship be break 

 well I have no learning to defend my cause withal 
but here be a friend will plead my matter in Westminster hall 

 godliness be great riches if a man be therewith content 
God for the godly will prepare that he shall have sufficient 

 thou be unhappy and bear in a evil hour 
that have no money nor for any can labour 
 do you see how he esteem this poor and simple wight 

perhaps he be more accept than thou in god sight 
he think none be happy but such as have money 
I will prove this man rich than thou by and by 
for he will be content with sufficient cloth and food 
and thou be not satisfy with twenty man good 
in opiae nauca desunt avaritiae omnia say Horatius 
few thing to the needy but all want to the covetous 
thou represent dives who have all his pleasure here 
but he represent Lazarus who now have heavenly cheer 
beware lest through thy riches thou have not endless pain 
the faithful and content wight in the end shall heaven attain 

 for Christ sake I suffer this poverty meek 
the cross of Christ I embrace most willing 
the rich for the most part be so hard heart 
that nothing I can get wherewith to be relieve 
yet God do open the heart of the poor sort 
that I have always sufficient myself to comfort 
it be a world to see how greedy they be of money 
for have a hundred pound they will not part with a penny 
but they will not stick vain to consume and spend 
a noble at a shot upon a feign friend 
God grace I fear i from such hard heart be pass 
that will not give the four score part of that they spend in waste 
neither learning nor money I be call wherever I go 
whereby I do suffer much pain hunger and woe 
therefore good gentleman I beseech you of your goodness 
give i your charity my body to refresh 
and though I be not able God will pay it certain 
at the last day with treble fold again 

 god forbid I shall from the poor withdraw my hand 
for then I shall not be able before the lord to stand 
what we give to the poor that we give to Christ 
to give to the needy poor God grant we always press 

 you take yourself I perceive in this case to be afterward 
therefore you shall be to high office prefer 

 good honest man relieve i I ask it for Christ sake 
if you know my need you will then some pity take 
give i of your abundance but one groat or penny 
and you shall receive it with gain at the last true 

 god help thou god help thou my own neighbour be very poor 
never a day but one or other be ever at my door 
I have never so much to do with money in my life 
God help thou good man I have a household and a wife 

 duae res sunt quae maxim homines ad maleficium impellunt luxury & avaritia 
two thing chief do man to mischief bring 
lechery and covetousness oh vile and sinful sting 
thou have even now enough thy neighbour to oppress 
but thou have not one penny on this poor man to spare 
if thou shall give he twelve penny what have thou the less 
God have harden thy heart and cast thy up I fear 

 if I shall diminish my money but one groat 
I shall not be quiet these two day I wot 
well come to my house tonight or to morn 
and I will see if I can spare thou a dish full of corn 

 of money pleasure and sin he be now entice 
I pray god with damnation he be not infect 
well walk thou in thy vocation whatever thou have 
praise thy god so long as life do last 

 what pain and trouble soever we bide here 
I pray God we be patient and the live God fear 
no pain we do suffer of heaven can be worthy 
the joy be so great no tongue can express 
therefore I care not for live never so painful 
for repent in Christ I shall have joy endless 
God reward you good gentleman for your good almose deed 
I have sufficient three day my hungry corpse to feed 

 for that I know God have send you riches 
great knowledge wisdom and learning withal 
beware of pleasure the mother of sin doubtless 
for if she once catch you to sin you shall be thrall 
it be write in the second de finibus 
Nemo est dignus nomine hominis qui unum totum diem velit esse be voluptate 
he be not worthy the name of a man be sure 
which spend the whole day in voluptuousness and pleasure 

 I thank God of such riches as I have 
but so long as I live it shall be my servile slave 
to lend to the needy to give to the poor 
to suffer none go empty that come to my door 
to bring up my household in god fear and faith 
and to be a example to such as like have 
and if you will be content hear with i to come 
you shall not want live as long as I have some 

 I thank you most hearty of your large promise 
I will wait upon you as my bind duty be

and they that find she be set by the heel for their labour 
there be a man kill and twenty witness by

and when I have speak every one hold his peace

and the thing she play for do after so prosper 
that her belly be full as late do appear 
and she fear lest thereby she shall be slander 
kill her child after she be deliver 
but as she convey it by some it be spy 
and so it be find whereby the truth be try 

 what this matter be not so great well for money sake 
that she have no harm myself will undertake 
they that shall give evidence shall be all tongue tie 
and the twelve man shall find her guiltless let she not be afraid 

 for a whore to have a child it be but a small matter 
and after it be bear the same to kill and murder 
be not my grandfather money of great power and might 
that such a crooked matter so quick can make straight 

 who be that that knock in such great post haste 

 one that without my lord help away be like to be cast 

 let he come in let i hear his matter 
if he come from money he shall not lose his labour 

 o my lord as I come by a hedge the last night 
of a few rag and clothes I chance to have a sight 
which when I have view with i I they take 
which be not worth a crown I dare swear on a book 
and I have a rich neighbour that threat i very sore

 I trust sir you will not go against your word 

 get thou hence prate knave I can do thou no good 

 god have mercy on we without a man have money

they shall starve and hang before of such I have compassion 

 through he you shall see none after will come 
unless they have money either more or some 
be not my grandfather money think you of great power 
that can save from hang such abominable whore 
that against all nature her own child do kill 
thus you may do for money what mischief you will 
and yonder poor knave that do steal for his need

because he lack money shall be hang for that deed 
you may see my grandsire be a man of renown

nay make it not so strange for the best of you all 
do love he so well you will come at his call 

 methinks I do hear one knock at the door

 knock soft in the mischief who make you so bold 

 I be William with the two wife I have bring my lord gold 
 let he in let he in I will his matter hear 
I will dispatch he quick he need not to fear 

my lord from money I have bring you such a token 
that I trust from my trouble I shall soon be holpen

 I have two wife I must needs confess 
I have to many by one I have rather have less 
to say truth to my first wife I have most right 
but I can not love she I swear by this light 
I marry she only for her good and riches 
she be a old crust none will marry she for love 
her mouth will slaver ever when I do she kiss 
therefore to take another my mind do i move 
who be both young and honest as her deed do well prove 
but the bishop do trouble i whereby I know well 
he will have i again with that old jade to dwell 

 a tire jade by thou I think she have not be 
for she be proper a jade that have be over ride 
and because thou have spare she now she be fresh and lusty 
therefore high her out for a hackney and she will bring thou money 

 the devil shall ride she if I set she out to hire 
I will she be with he in the midst of hell fire 

 have thou any riches by she any land or wood 

 I have three hundred pound by she beside her other good 

 she may be very glad that on thou her good do spare 
that will let she forth to be the devil hackney mare 

 so I be rid on she I care not where she be 

 thou shall be speed herein even as thou do require 
I will find mean with witness to be prove 
that she before her marriage to another be betroth 
whereby with thy young wife thou shall live at ease 
thou may thank money my old friend I wiss 
or else thou may trust i I will not have do this 

 I thank you sir hearty for the pain you have take 
I will remember you every year with a Christmas capon 

 these be goodly old angel take heed you do not lose they 
have not they pretty wing that can fly into your bosom 

 I will keep they safe enough I must needs love they 
it be a crooked matter that I will not make straight for they 

 there be some jolly suitor do not you hear he knock 
soft sir soft lest you break the lock 

 let he in quick whatsoever he be 
if money have send he he be welcome to i 

 come near to my lord and tell he your matter 
do my grandfather money will you come hither 

 I think I have come in vain unless he have send i 
sir here be a dozen portague if you will help i 

 now I be ready to hear thou tell it out along 
I will help thou without doubt be it right or wrong 

 either right or wrong thy matter must needs be 
therefore thou may speak thou speed I will warrant thou I 

 there be a poor knave by i have a piece of ground 
not worth by year past three or four pound 
and I have at the villain such hate and spite 
that I will have it from he although it be his right 
the land lie so handsome at the back side of my house 
that I be as greedy thereof as cat of a mouse 

 by what right and title do you the same claim 

 his name be Nicholas we be both of one name 
but no kin at all I be sure he be to i 
yet though my title be nought I will weary he with money 
the law be open I be sure for every man 
marry let he make his plea as well as he can 
do not many give over their title in a year 
some for want of money and some for very fear 

 be here all the title you have good man Nchol 
thou care not so thou have it what become of thy fall 

 so that I have it I care not for hereafter 
when I be dead and rot it will be good for my child 

 it be a good wind that blow no man too evil 
but happy be those child who father go to the devil 
no good plea herein I think thou can invent 

 do you not think that I have feign a dissent 
and thereby claim a right that never be before 
the rich may soon overcome the moneyless and the poor 
and yet that I shall lose it I sure be afraid 
unless you cause judgement the next term to be stay 
 I will get it stay I have thou now promise 

but in the mean space see that you have write forge 
and also false witness two or three at the jest 
who may swear if need be thou have buy his interest 
and this way thou be sure to have thy desire 
go about thy business dry wood soon catch fire 

 marry sir this be the way that must needs prevail 
I thank you sir hearty for tell i this tale

how do thou with the bishop when he do oppose thou

he care not though at length he go to the devil 
so that with money he may his bag fill

and I send he to damnation and he send he to hell quick 
and when he be there he have get a proper place

to match my son with such I pass not of a fly 
my throat for want of drink begin to be dry 
who be it that call i to drink some good ale 
forsooth I will be with you by and by 
it be sir Laurence livingles twenty pound to a 
he will tipple at it solemn as long as it be stale 
and the rather I think it be he because of his talk 
for he say before his go that all the pot shall walk 
o woe woe that ever on the earth I live 
woe be to that hour when I first be deliver 
my guilty conscience prick i day by day 
judas I be call that do my master betray 
I do see Christ miracle and hear his predication 
o that I have have grace to be with the rest in salvation 
I want God grace and his especial favour 
whereby I hang myself and die in despair 
and now the time be past any mercy to crave 
one half hour to live I will desire but to have 
well it will not be nothing will help i now 
wherever I do go damnation do i follow 
woe worth that money that ever it be make 
by which occasion my master be betray 
but have I have grace to have ask mercy therefore 
and repent my fault as Peter do before 
I shall have be pardon as other summer be 
and account no sinner God will have mercy 
so that they ask mercy so long as they do live 
all which time he be ready their sin to forgive 
woe therefore to i and to all that have so die 
for without remedy now I be for ever damn 
o what have belly pleasure bring i unto 
to hell torment to a place of everlasting woe 
woe woe and woe again to i for evermore 
that consume so much on myself and nothing on the poor 
poor Lazarus be at my door who hunger be so great 
that he therewith soon die not have for to eat 
when I with all fine fare like a glutton be serve 
and like a greedy cormorant with belly full farce 
not suffer one morsel to Lazarus to be give 
and yet be there more spoil than a hundred will eat certain 
to feed the dog therewith I be much better content 
or else some relief to he I will have send 
the silly and dumb dog do he more good than I 
for they lick his sore oh woe therefore to i 
and then he die full soon who death please God so well 
that in Abraham bosom he aye shall rest and dwell 
and I then die also without any repentance 
whereby I have get God wrath and heavy vengeance 
for I be a damn soul for ever in torment and pain 
my pleasure on the earth have bring i to this gain 
and though the torment be so vehement and the fiery flame so great 
yet I can have a drop of water to quench and cool my heat 
I deny poor Lazarus to give he meat and food 
and now he deny i to help or do i good 
a woeful change to i to he it be not so 
for he from pain to pleasure past and I from weal to woe 
for if I be on the earth as I be once before 
I will spare from myself and give it to the poor 
what be I the better now for all my joy and pleasure 
and what be he worse now for all his pain and hunger 
if have all my pleasure at the last I have be save 
my former pleasure have be vain none do they there regard 
and if in cruel torment all my life I have lie 
yet in respect they all be joy to this eternal pain 
damnation damnation be come woe to we therefore 
alas alas that we have this foresee before 

 come come you woeful wight it be folly now to prate 
to speak complain or else of matter to debate 
away unto that doleful place whereas the devil lie 
the best cheer that you shall have there be groan and gnash of tooth 
of money thou so greedy be thy master to betray 
and after in despair thou make thyself away 
and thou do pamper up thy gorge and poor do not regard 
wherefore thy last assure hope be hell for thy reward 
where be now thy money wherefore sell thou thy master 
where be now thy fare wherein thou have thy pleasure 
you will not take heed while that you be live 
therefore you must pay for it in hell without end 
I think if on the earth you be alive again 
you will not from your pleasure for all this refrain 
for the most part on the earth do live so wicked 
that they think there be no hell to punish sin true 
in money they have great love in pride they do exceed 
in gluttony and lechery their life they do still lead 

 o if I be on the earth and be alive again 
I will be a spectacle to all that there remain 
oh vain love of money oh most stink pride 
the remembrance of such sin I can not now abide 

 if I have but one hour in flesh and blood to live 
I will a thousand turn from sin I certain believe 
woe worth the pleasure past that work i now such care 
whereby I be a damn soul good folk of i beware 

 away away you wretched soul to hell you must needs go 
and such as die as you have do shall dwell with you also 

what heart but must lament 
to hear the rueful dolour of those two damn wight 
what hard and stony heart but will hereat repent 
and pray continual yea both day and night 
who die without repentance thus damnation they dite 
therefore happy be they what trouble soever they have 
which trust and die in jesus Christ through who God will they save 
here have you have inordinate love 
which man have to money although it work his woe 
but such as have any grace this will they stir and move 
to cast their love from money and other pleasure also 
for fear they dwell with the devil their cruel and mortal foe 
to late then to repent as judas and dives do 
there be no help in hell for then God mercy be hide 
therefore I be come call godly admonition 
warn you to repent before your breath be go 
for fear you bring yourself to endless damnation 
but then there be no hope although you cry and groan 
therefore how happy be they that have time to make their move 
now cast away your pride and also the love of money 
for fear you shall not when you will as late you do see 

 I be to the godly a precious jewel and virtue 
who can without i virtue be in good favour 

 humility or clemency be my name true 
bless say Christ be the meek for they shall obtain mercy 
we may learn humility of Christ our master and head 
who bear his cross meek whereon he be kill 

 who can live without charity to God honour and glory 
who without i can die in god favour 
charity be enemy to all hatred and fury 
I cause the rich to help the needy and the poor 

 for that you be all three the especial gift of God 
without who none can be a perfect and godly wight 
let we pray therefore the sin that God forbid 
we may cast away with speed most wicked in his sight 
the inordinate love of money and pride in which many delight 
and all other sin which lead we to damnation 
and that we repent and die in Christ whereby we have salvation 

 let we pray for the queen majesty our sovereign governor 
that she may reign quiet accord to god will 
whereby she may suppress vice and set forth God glory and honour 
and as she have begin godly so to continue still 

 let we not forget to pray for the honourable counsel 
that they maintain justice and all wrong to expel 

 and all the high estate and commons of this region 
with all that be here present to have everlasting salvation
