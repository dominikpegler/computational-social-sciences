victorious prince summon to appear 
within the continent of Africa 
from sevenfold Nilus to Taprobany 
where fair Apollo dart forth his light 
play on the sea 
from Cadiz land where stout Hercules 
emblaze his trophy on two post of brass 
to Tanais who swift decline flood 
environ rich Europa to the north 
all fetch from out your court by beauty to this coast 
to seek and sue for fair Angelica 
sith none but one must have this happy prize 
at which you all have level long your thought 
set each man forth his passion how he can

over who climate never hang a cloud 
but smile Titan light the horizon 
Egypt be i and there I hold my state

that wanton Venus manth upon her fist 
force i to cross and cut the atlantic sea 
to oversearch the fearful ocean 
where I arrive to eternize with my lance 
the matchless beauty of fair Angelica 
nor tilt nor tourney but my spear and shield 
resound on their crest and sturdy helm 
top high with plume like mar his burgonet 
enchase on their curate with my blade 
that none so fair as fair Angelica 
but leave these such glory as they be 
I love my lord let that suffice for i 

Cuba my seat a region so enrich 
with favour sparkle from the smile heaven 
as those that seek for traffic to my coast 
account like that wealthy paradise 
from whence flow Gyhon and swift Euphrates 
the earth within her bowel have enwrap 
as in the massy storehouse of the world 
million of gold as bright as be the shower 
that wanton jove send down to Danae 
march from thence to manage arm abroad 
I pass the triple part regiment 
that froward Saturn give unto his son 
erect statue of my chivalry 
such and so brave as never Hercules

but leave these such glory as they be 
I love my lord let that suffice for i 

and I my lord be Mandricard of Mexico 
who climate fair than Tiberius

and rich than the plot Hesperides 
or that same I will wherein Ulysses love

so will she like the land of Mexico 
as Paphos and brave cypress set aside

such as transport jason to the fleece 
come from the south I furrow Neptune sea 
Northeast as far as be the freeze Rhine 
leave fair Voya cross up Danuby 
as high as Saba who enhance stream

but leave these such glory as they be 
I love my lord let that suffice for i 

the border land seat here in ken 
who shore be sprinkle with rich orient pearl 
more bright of hue than be the Margaret 
that Caesar find in wealthy Albion 
the sand of Tagus all of burnish gold 
make Thetis never proud on the cliff 
that overpeer the bright and golden shore 
than do the rubbish of my country sea 
and what I dare let say the Portugal 
and Spaniard tell who man with mighty fleet 
come come to subdue my island to their king to their king 
fill our sea with stately argosy 
calvar and magars hulk of burden great 
which Brandemart rebate from his coast 
and send they home ballast with little wealth 
but leave these such glory as they be 
I love my lord let that suffice for i 

lord of the south and prince of esteem 
viceroy unto the state of Africa 
I be no king yet be I princely bear 
descend from the royal house of France 
and nephew to the mighty Charlemagne 
surname Orlando the county palatine 
swift fame that sound to our western sea 
the matchless beauty of Angelica 
fair than be the nymph of Mercury 
who when bright Phoebus mount up his coach 
and tract Aurora in her silver step 
and sprinkle from the fold of her lap 
white lily rose and sweet violet 
yet thus believe i prince of the south 
although my country love dear than pearl 
or mine of gold may well have keep i back 
the sweet converse with my king and friend 
leave all for love may well have keep i back 
the sea by Neptune hoist to the heaven 
who dangerous flaw may well have keep i back 
the savage moor and anthropophagi 
who land I pass may well have keep i back 
the doubt of entertainment in the court 
when I arrive may well have keep i back 
but so the fame of fair Angelica 
stamp in my thought the figure of her love 
as neither country king or sea or cannibal 
can by despair keep Orlando back 
I list not boast in act of chivalry 
a humour never fit with my mind 
but come there forth the proud champion 
that have suspicion in the palatine 
and with my trusty sword Durandell 
single I will register upon his helm 
what I dare do for fair Angelica 
but leave these such glory as they be 
I love my lord 
Angelica herself shall speak for i 

daughter thou hear what love have here allege 
how all these king by beauty summon here 
put in their plea for hope of diadem 
of noble deed of wealth and chivalry 
all hope to possess Angelica 
sith father will may hap to aim amiss 
for parent thought in love oft step awry 
choose thou the man who best content thou 
and he shall wear the afric crown next i 
for trust i daughter like of who thou please 
thou satisfy my thought shall be at ease 

king of the south viceroy of Africa 
sith father will hang on his daughter choice 
and I as erst princess Andromache 
seat amid the crew of Priam son 
have liberty to choose where best I love 
must free say for fancy have no fraud 
that far unworthy Angelica 
of such as deign to grace she with their love 
the sultan with his seat in Babylon 
the prince of Cuba and of Mexico 
who wealthy crown may win a woman will 
young Brandemard master of all the isle 
where Neptune plant have his treasury 
the worst of these man of so high import 
as may command a great dame than I 
but fortune or some deep inspire fate 
Venus or else the bastard brat of Mars 
who bow command the motion of the mind 
have send proud love to enter such a plea 
as nonsuit all your princely evidence 
and flat command that maugre majesty 
I choose Orlando county palatine 

how like Marsillus of his daughter choice 

as fit Marsillus of his daughter spouse 

high thou wrong we king of Africa 
to brave thy neighbour prince with disgrace 
to tie thy honour to thy daughter thought 
who choice be like that greekish giglot love 
that leave her lord prince Menelaus 
and with a swain make escape away to Troy 
what be Orlando but a straggle mate 
banish for some offence by Charlemagne 
skip from his country as Anchises son 
and mean as he do to the Carthage queen 
to pay her ruth and ruin for her love 

injurious Cuba ill it fit thy gree 
to wrong a stranger with discourtesy 
be not the sacred presence of Angelica 
prevail with i as Venus smile with Mars 
to set a Supersedeas of my wrath 
soon shall I teach thou what it be too brave 

And french man be not against the law of arm 
in place of parley for to draw a sword 
untaught companion I will learn you know 
what duty long to such a prince as he 

then as do Hector fore Achilles tent 
trot his courser soft on the plain 
proud dare forth the stout youth of Greece 
so who stand high in his own conceit 
and think his courage can perform the most 
let he but throw his gauntlet on the ground 
and I will pawn my honour to his gage 
he shall ere night be meet and combat 

shame you not prince at this bad agree 
to wrong a stranger with discourtesy 
believe i lord my daughter have make choice 
and maugre he that think he most aggrieve 
she shall enjoy the county palatine 

but will these prince follow my advice 
and enter arm as do the greek against Troy 
nor he nor thou shall have Angelica 

let he be think a dastard to his death 
that will not sell the travel he have pass 
dear than for a woman foolery 
what say the mighty Mandricard 

I vow to hie i home to Mexico 
to troop myself with such a crew of man 
as shall so fill the down of Africa 
like to the plain of watery Thessaly 
whenas a Eastern gale whistle aloft 
have overspread the ground with grasshopper 
then see Marsillus if the palatine 
can keep his love from fall to our lot 
or thou can keep thy country free from spoil 

why think you lord with haughty menace 
to dare i out within my palace gate 
or hope you to make conquest by constraint 
of that which never can be get by love 
pass from my court make haste out of my land 
stay not within the bound Marsillus hold 
lest little brook these unfitting brave 
my choler overslip the law of arm 
and I inflict revenge on such abuse 

I will beard and brave thou in thy proper town 
and here ensconce myself despite of thou 
and hold thou play till Mandricard return 
what say the mighty sultan of Egypt 

that when prince Menelaus with all his mate 
have ten year hold their siege in Asia 
fold their wrath in cinder of fair Troy 
yet for their arm grow by conceit of love 
their trophy be but conquest of a girl 
then trust i lord I will never manage arm 
for woman love that be so quick lose 

tush my lord why stand you upon term 
let we to our sconce and you my lord to Mexico 

I sir ensconce you how you can see what we dare 
and thereon set your rest 

boast not too much Marsillus in thyself 
nor of contentment in Angelica 
for Sacrepant must have Angelica 
and with her Sacrepant must have the crown 
by hook or crook I must and will have both 
ah sweet revenge incense their angry mind 
till all these prince welter in their blood 
the crown do fall to county Sacrepant 
sweet be the thought that smother from conceit 
for when I come and set i down to rest 
my chair present a throne of majesty 
and when I set my bonnet on my head 
methinks I fit my forehead for a crown 
and when I take my truncheon in my fist 
a sceptre then come tumble in my thought 
my dream be princely all of diadem 
honour methinks the title be too base 
mighty glorious and excellent 
I these my glorious genius sound within my mouth 
these please the care and with a sweet applause 
make i in term coequal with the god 
then these Sacrepant and none but these 
and these or else make hazard of thy life 
let it suffice I will conceal the rest 
sirrah 

my lord 

my lord how base be this slave bring up 
that know no title fit for dignity 
to grace his master with hyperbole 
my lord why the base baron of fair Africa 
deserve as much yet county Sacrepant 
must he a swain salute with name of lord 
sirrah what think the emperor of my colour 
because in field I wear both blue and red at once 

they deem my lord your honour live at peace 
as one that be neuter in these mutiny 
and covet to rest equal friend to both 
neither envious to prince Mandricard 
nor wish ill unto Marsillus 
that you may safe pass where ere you please 
with friendly salutation from they both 

ay so they guess but level far awry 
for if they know the secret of my thought 
my emblem sort to another sense 
I wear not these as one resolve to peace 
but blue and red as enemy to both 
Blue as hate king Marsillus 
and red as in revenge to Mandricard 
foe unto both friend only to myself 
and to the crown for that be the golden mark 
which make my thought dream on a diadem 
see not thou all man presage I shall be king 
Marsillus send to i for peace 
Mandrecard put of his cap ten mile of 
two thing more and then I can miss the crown 

o what be those my good lord 

first must I get the love of fair Angelica 
now be I full of amorous conceit 
not that I doubt to have what I desire 
but how I may best with my honour woo 
write or entreat fie that fit not 
send by ambassador no that be too base 
flat command I that be for Sacrepant 
say thou be Sacrepant and art in love 
and who in Africa dare say the county nay 
o Angelica fair than Chloris when in all her pride 
bright Maia son entrap her in the net 
wherewith Vulcan entangle the god of war 

your honour be so far in contemplation of Angelica 
as you have forget the second in attain to the crown 

that be to be do by poison prowess or any mean of treachery to put to death the traitorous Orlando but who be this come here stand close 

I be send on embassage to the right mighty and magnificent alias the right proud and pontifical the county Sacrepant for Marsillus and Orlando know he to be as full of prowess as policy and fear lest in lean to the other faction he may great prejudice they they seek first to hold the candle before the devil and know he to be a thrasonical madcap they have send i a gnathonical companion to give he lettuce fit for his lip now sir know his astronomical humour as one that gaze so high at the star as he never look on the pavement in the street but whist Lupus est in fabula 

sirrah thou that ruminate to thyself a catalogue of privy conspiracy what be thou 

God save your majesty 

my majesty come hither my well nutriment knave who take i to be 

the mighty Mandricard of Mexico 

I hold these salutation as ominous for salute i by that which I be not he presage what I shall be for so do the lacedaemonian by Agathocles who of a base potter wear the kingly diadem but why deem thou i to be the mighty Mandricard of Mexico 

marry sir 

stay there be thou never in France 

yes if it please your majesty 

so it seem for there they salute their king by the name of sir monsieur but forward 

such spark of peerless majesty 
from those look flame like lightning from the east 
as either Mandricard or else some great prince 

methinks these salutation make my thought to be heroical but say to who be thou send 

to the county Sacrepant 

why I be he 

it please your majesty to jest 

whatever I seem I tell thou I be he 

then may it please your honour the emperor Marsillus together with his daughter Angelica and Orlando entreat your excellency to dine with they 

be Angelica there 

there my good lord 

sirrah 

my lord 

villain Angelica send for i 
see that thou entertain that happy messenger 
and bring he in with thou 

prince of France the sparkle light of fame 
who glory bright than the burnish gate 
from whence Latona lordly son do march 
when mount on his coach tinsel with flame 
he triumph in the beauty of the heaven 
this be the place where Rodamant lie hide 
here lie he like the thief of Thessaly 
which scud abroad and search for his prey 
and be get straight he gallop home 
as one that dare not break a spear in field 
but trust i prince I have gird his fort 
and I will sack it or on this castle wall 
I will write my resolution with my blood therefore drum sound a parley 

who be that trouble our sleep 

why sluggard see thou not Lycaon son 
the hardy ploughswain unto mighty jove 
have trace his silver furrow in the heaven 
and turn home his overwatched team 
give leave unto Apollo chariot 
I tell thou sluggard sleep be far unfit 
for such as still have hammer in their head 
but only hope of honour and revenge 
these call i forth to rouse thy master up 
tell he from i false coward as he be 
that Orlando the county palatine 
be come this morning with a band of french 
to play he huntsup with a point of war 
I will be his minstrel with my drum and fife 
bid he come forth and dance it if he dare 
let fortune throw her favor where she list 

Frenchman between half sleep and awake 
although the misty veil strain over Cynthia 
hinder my sight from nothing all thy crew 
yet for I know thou and thy straggle groom 
can in conceit build castle in the sky 
but in your action like the stammer greek 
which breathe his courage bootless in the air 
I wish thou well Orlando get thou go 
say that a sentinel do suffer thou 
for if the round or court of guard shall hear 
thou or thy man be bray at the wall 
Charles wealth the wealth of all his western mine 
find in the mountain of transalpine France 
may not pay ransom to the king for thou 

brave sentinel if nature have enchase 
a sympathy of courage to thy tale 
and like the champion of Andromache 
thou or thy master dare come out the gate 
maugre the watch the round or court of guard 
I will attend to abide the coward here 
if not but still the craven sleep secure 
pitch his guard within a trench of stone 
tell he his wall shall serve he for no proof 
but as the son of Saturn in his wrath 
pash all the mountain at Typheus head 
and topsy turuie turn the bottom up 
so shall the castle of proud Rodamant 
and so brave lord of France let we to the fight 

the fox be escape but here be his case 
I miss he near it be time for he to trudge 
how now my lord of Aquitaine 

my lord the court of guard be put unto the sword 
and all the watch that think themselves so sure 
so that not one within the castle breath 

Come then let we post amain to find out Rodamant 
and then in triumph march unto Marsillus 

I marvel Medor what my father mean 
to enter league with county Sacrepant 

madam the king your father wise enough 
he know the county like to Cassius 
sit sad dump aim Caesar death 
yet cry ave to his majesty 
but madam mark a while and you shall see 
your father shake he off from secrecy 

so much I guess for when he will I shall 
give entertainment to the dote earl 
his speech be end with a frown smile 

madam see where he come I will be go 

how fare my fair Angelica 

well that my lord so friendly be in league as honour will he with Marsillus 

Angelica shall I have a word or two with thou 

what please my lord for to command 

then know my love I can paint my grief 
nor tell a tale of Venus and her son 
report such a catalogue of toy 
it fit not Sacrepant to be effeminate 
only give leave my fair Angelica 
to say the county be in love with thou 

pardon my lord my love be overpass 
so firm be Orlando print in my thought 
as love has leave no place for any else 

why overween damsel see thou not 
thy lawless love unto this straggle mate 
have fill our Africa region full of blood 
and will thou still persevere in thy love 
tush leave the palatine and go with i 

brave county know where sacred love unite 
the knot of gordian at the shrine of jove 
be never half so hard or intricate 
as be the band which lovely Venus tie 
sweet be my love and for I love my lord 
seek not unless as Alexander do 
to cut the ploughswain trace with thy sword 
or slice the slender fillet of my life 
or else my lord Orlando must be i 

stand I on love stoop I to Venus lure 
that never yet do fear the god of war 
shall man report that county Sacrepant 
hold lover pain for pine passion 
shall such a Siren offer i more wrong 
than they do to the prince of Ithaca 
no as he his care so county stop thy eye 
go to your needle lady and your clout 
go to such milksop as be fit for love 
I will employ my busy brain for war 

let not my lord denial breed offence 
love do allow her favor but to one 
nor can there sit within the sacred shrine 
of Venus more than one install heart 
Orlando be the gentleman I love 
and more than he may not enjoy my love 

damsel be go fancy have take leave 
where I take hurt there have I heal myself 
as those that with Achilles lance be wound 
fetch help at self same point spear 
beauty begin brave and beauty have repulse 
and beauty get you go to your Orlando 

my lord have love amate he who thought 
have ever be heroical and brave 
stand you in dump like to the Myrmidon 
trap in the tress of Polixena 
who amid the glory of his chivalry 
sit daunt with a maid of Asia 

think thou my thought be lunacy of love 
no they be brand fire in Pluto forge 
where sit Tisiphone temper in flame 
those torch that do set on fire revenge 
I loud the dame but brave by her repulse 
hate call i on to quittance all my ill 
which first must come by offer prejudice 
unto Orlando her belove love 

o how may that be bring to pass my lord 

thus thou see that Medor and Angelica 
be still so secret in their private walk 
as that they trace the shady lawn 
and thick shadow grove 
which well may breed suspicion of some love 
now than the french no nation under heaven 
be soon touch with sting of jealousy 

and what of that my lord 

hard by for solace in a secret grove 
the county once a day fail not to walk 
there solemn he ruminate his love 
upon those shrub that compass in the spring 
and on those tree that border in those walk 
I will sly have engrave on every bark 
the name of Medor and Angelica 
hard by I will have some roundelay hang up 
wherein shall be some posy of their love 
fraught so full of fiery passion 
as that the county shall perceive by proof 
Medor have win his fair Angelica 

be this all my lord 

no for thou like to a shepherd shall be clothe 
with staff and bottle like some country swain 
that tend his flock feed upon these down 
there see thou buzz into the county eat 
that thou have often see within these wood 
base Medor sport with Angelica 
and when he hear a shepherd simple tale 
he will not think it be feign 
then either a mad mood will end his love 
or worse betide he through fond jealousy 

excellent my lord see how I will play the shepherd 

and mark thou how I play the carver 
therefore be go and make the ready straight 

thus all alone and like a shepherd swain 
as Paris when Oenone loud he well 
forget he be the son of Priamus 
all clad in grey sit pipe on a reed 
so I transform to this country shape 
haunt these grove to work my master will 
to plague the palatine with jealousy 
and to conceit he with some deep extreme 
here come the man unto his wont walk 

Orgalio go see a sentinel be place 
and bid the soldier keep a court of guard 
so to hold watch till secret here alone 
I meditate upon the thought of love 

I will my lord 

fair queen of love thou mistress of delight 
thou gladsome lamp that wait on Phoebe train 
spread thy kindness through the jar orb 
that in their union praise thy last power 
thou that have stay the fiery Phlegon course 
and make the coachman of the glorious wain 
to droop in view of Daphne excellence 
fair pride of morn sweet beauty of the even 
look on Orlando languish in love 
sweet solitary grove whereas the nymph 
with pleasance laugh to see the satyr play 
witness Orlando faith unto his love 
Tread she these land kind Flora boast thy pride 
seek she for shade spread cedar for her sake 
fair Flora make her couch amid thy flower 
sweet crystal spring wash you with rose 
when she long to drink ah think my heaven 
ah heaven that know my thought 
smile joy in she that my content have wrought 

the heaven of love be but a pleasant hell 
where none but foolish wife imprison dwell 

Orlando what contrarious thought be these 
that flock with doubtful motion in thy mind 
heaven smile and tree do boast their summer pride 
what Venus write her triumph here beside 

yet when thy eye have see they heart shall rue 
the tragic chance that short shall ensue 

Angelica ah sweet and heavenly name 
life to my life and essence to my joy 
but soft this gordian knot together counite 
a Medor partner in her peerless love 
unkind and will she bend her thought to change 
her name her writing ah foolish and unkind 
no name of she unless the brook relent 
to hear her name and Rhodanus vouchsafe 
to raise his moisten lock from out the reed 
and flow with calm alongst his turn bound 
no name of she unless Zephyrus blow 
her dignity alongst Ardenia wood 
where all the world for wonder do await 
and yet her name for why Angelica 
but mix with Medor not Angelica 
only by i be loud Angelica 
only for i must live Angelica 
I find her drift perhaps the modest pledge 
of my content have with a secret smile 
and sweet disguise restrain her fancy thus 
figure Orlando under Medor name 
fine drift fair nymph Orlando hope no less 

poor hapless man these thought contain the hell 

ah false Angelica what have we more 

what dare Medor court my Venus 
what may Orlando deem 
Aetna forsake the bound of Sicily 
for now in i thy restless flame appear 
refuse contemn disdain what worse than these 
Orgalio 

my lord 

boy view these tree carve with true love knot 
the inscription Medor and Angelica 
and read these verse hang up of their love 
now tell i boy what do thou think 

by my troth my lord I think Angelica be a woman 

and what of that 

therefore unconstant mutable have their love hang in their eyelid that as they be get with a look so they be lose again with a wink but here be a shepherd it may be he can tell we news 

what messenger have Ate send abroad 
with idle look to listen my lament 
sirrah who wrong happy nature so 
to spoil these tree with this Angelica 
yet in her name Orlando they be bless 

I be a shepherd swain thou wander knight 
that watch my flock not one that follow love 

as follow love why dare thou dispraise my heaven 
or once disgrace or prejudice her name 
be not Angelica the queen of love 
deck with the compound wreath of Adonis flower 
she be 
then speak thou peasant what be he that dare 
attempt to court my queen of love 
or I shall send thy soul to Charon charge 

brave knight since fear of death enforce still 
in great mind submission and relent 
know that this Medor who unhappy name 
be mix with the fair Angelica 
be even that Medor that enjoy her love 
you cave bear witness of their kind content 
yond meadow talk the action of their joy 
our shepherd in their song of solace sing 
Angelica do none but Medor love 

Angelica do none but Medor love 
shall Medor then possess Orlando love 
dainty and gladsome beam of my delight 
delicious brow why smile your heaven for those 
that wander make you prove Orlando foe 
lend i your plaint you sweet arcadian nymph 
that wont to wail your new depart love 
thou weep flood leave Orpheus wail for i 
and Titan niece gather all in one 
those fluent spring of your lament tear 
and let they flow alongst my faintful look 

now be the fire late smother in suspect 
kindle and burn within his angry breast 
now have I do the will of Sacrepant 

foemineum servile genus crudele superbum 
discourteous woman nature fair ill 
the woe of man that first create curse 
base female sex spring from black Ate loin 
proud disdainful cruel and unjust 
who word be shade with enchant will 
worse than Medusa mate all our mind 
and in their heart sit shameless treachery 
turn a truthless vile circumference 
o can my fury paint their fury forth 
for hell be no hell compare to their heart 
too simple devil to conceal their art 
bear to be plague unto the thought of man 
bring for eternal pestilence to the world 
o femmenelle in genio de toute it sede 
comet vulge mute fachilment 
contrario zero propria de la fede 
o infelice miserate crede

thus lording when our banquet be do 
and Orlando espouse to Angelica 
we will furrow through the move ocean 
and cheer frolic with great Charlemagne
