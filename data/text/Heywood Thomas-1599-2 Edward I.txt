be this the aid our cousin Burgundy 
and the great constable of France assure we 
have we march thus far through the heart of France 
and with the terror of our english drum

I cheer my firm persuasion with your hope 
and gild they with my best oratory 
I frame my speech still fit as I sound 
the temper of his humour to be wrought upon

muddy and methinks ever through his eye

and one that do intend no good to you 
and he will come and yet he want power 
he will fain come but may not leave the siege 
he hope he shall but yet he know not when 
he purpose but some impediment

disguise with a cushion on his head 
a drawer apron for a herald coat 
And tell the count the king of England crave 
one of his worthy honour dogkennel 
to be his lodging for a day or two 
with some such other tavern foolery 
with that this filthy rascal greasy rout 
brace out in laughter at this worthy jest 
neigh like horse thus the count saint Paul 
regard his promise to your majesty 

Will no man thrust the slave into a sackbut 

now by this light be I but near the slave with a black Jack I will beat out his brain 

if it please your highness but to say the word

where peace shall yield he more than he can win 
we covet peace and we will purchase it 
at any rate that reason can demand

king Edward hope of my conjoin with he 

and I will keep i still here in S Quintin 
pretend mighty matter for his aid 
but not perform any on my word

so much as page or lackey to attend thou 
as who shall say thy presence be munition 
and strength enough to answer our expect 
summer be almost spend yet nothing do 
and all by dalliance with uncertain hope 

my force lay before the city Nuse 
from which I can not rise but with dishonour 
unless upon some composition have 

there be no such exception in your letter 
why smile lord scale 

my man report my lord 
the composition that the duke there make 
be mere compulsion for the citizen 
drive he from thence perforce 

I think so much 
we shall not yet have see your excellence 
but that your heel be better than your hand 

lord scale thou do i wrong to slander i 

let that pass it shall be see my lord 
that we be able of ourself to claim 
our right in France without or your assistance 
or any other but the help of heaven 

I make no question of it yet the constable 
press with no such occasion as I be 
may have excuse we both if he have please 

accuse he not your city as we come 
be even as much to be condemn as he 
they give we leave to lie within the field 
and scarce will afford we meat for money 
this be small friendship in respect of that 
you have engage your honour to perform 
but march we forward as we be determine 
this be S Quintin where you say my lord 
the constable be ready to receive we 

so much he signify to i by letter 

well we shall see his entertainment forward 
fly to our main battle bid they stand 
there be treason plot speak to i lord scale 
or if there be no power of life remain

two of our common soldier slay beside 
this be hard welcome but it be not you 
at who the fatal engineer do aim 
my breast the level be though you the mark 
in which conspiracy answer i duke 
be not thy soul as guilty as the earl 

perish my soul king Edward if I know 
of any such intention yet I do and grieve that it 
have speed no otherwise 

Howard and Sellinger 
what be there hope of life in none of they 

the soldier be both slay outright my lord 
but the lord scale a little be recover 

convey his body to our pavilion 
and let our surgeon use all diligence 
they can devise for safeguard of his life 
while we with all extremity of war 
go plague S Quintin Howard fetch on our power 
we will not stir a foot till we have she wne 
just vengeance on the constable of France 
o God to woo we first to pass the sea 
and at our come thus to halt with we 
I think the like thereof be never see 
but where be the duke 

go as it seem my lord 
step secret away as one that know 
his conscience will accuse he if he stay 

a pair of most dissemble hypocrite 
be he and this base earl on who I vow 
leave king Lewis unprejudiced in peace 
to spend the whole measure of my kindle rage 
their street shall sweat with their effuse blood 
and this bright sun be darken with the smoke 
of smoulder cinder when their city lie 
bury in ash of revengeful fire 
on who pale superstcies in the stead 
of parchment with my lance I will draw these line 
Edward of England leave this memory 
in just revenge of hateful treachery 
lord Howard have you do as I command 

our battle be dispose and on the brow 
of every inferior servitor my lord 
you may behold destruction figure 
greedy thrust to begin the fight 
but when no long they may be restrain 
and that the drum and trumpet both begin 
to sound war cheerful harmony behold 
a flag of truce upon the wall be hang 
and forth the gate do issue meek pace 
three man whereof the constable be one 
the other two the gunner and his mate 
by who gross oversight as they report 
this sudden chance unwitting befall 

bring forth the constable the other two 
see they safe guard till you know our pleasure 
now my lord Howard how be it with scale 

well my dread sovereign now his wound be dress 
and by the opinion of the surgeon

I be the glad but unfaithful earl 
I do not see how yet I can dispense 
with thy submission this be not the welcome 
your letter send to England promise i 

right high and mighty prince condemn i not 
that be as innocent in this offence 
as any soldier in the english army 
the fault be in our gunner ignorance 
who take you for Lewis king of France 
that likewise be within the city ken 
make that unlucky shot to beat he back 
and not of malice to your majesty 
to knowledge which I bring they with myself 
and thirty thousand crown within this purse 
send by the burgher to redeem your lack

to quit their death those two that come with thou 
shall both be cram into a cannon mouth 
and so he shoot into the town again 
it be not like but that they know our colour 
and of set purpose do this villainy 
nor can I be persuade thorough 
but that our person be the mark they aim at 
yet be we well content to hold you excuse 
marry our soldier must be satisfy 
and therefore first shall be distribute 
these crown among they than you shall return 
and of your best provision send to we 
thirty wain load beside twelve ton of wine

their peace be make otherwise I will proclaim 
free liberty for all to take the spoil

and thus he say by i when be it see 
that ever Lewis pretend hurt to England 
either by close conspirator send over 
to undermine your state or open 
by take arm with purpose to invade 
nay when be it that Lewis be ever hear 
so much as to detract from Edward name 
but still have do he all his due of speech 
by blaze to the world his high desert 
of wisdom valour and his heroic birth 
whence be it then that Edward be incense 
to render hate for love for amity stern war 
not of himself we know but by the mean 
of some infectious counsel that like mud 
will spoil the pure temper of his noble mind 
it be the duke and that pernicious rebel 
earl of S Paul have set abroach these war 
who of themselves unable to proceed 
will make your grace the instrument of wrong 
and when you have do what you can for they 
you shall be sure of nothing but of this

to do your grace all office of love 
and what commodity may spring thereby 
to both the realm your grace be wise enough 
without my rude suggestion to imagine 
beside much bloodshed for this present time 
will be prevent when two such personage 
shall meet together to shake hand in peace 
and not with shock of lance and curtleaxe 
that Lewis be willing I be his substitute 
and he himself in person if you please 
not far from hence will signify as much 

sir withdraw and give we leave a while 
to take advisement of our counselor 
what say you lord unto this proffer truce 

in my conceit let it not be slip my lord 

will not be dishonour have land 
so great a army in these part of France 
and not to fight before we do return 

how can it when the enemy submit 
and of himself make tender of allegiance 

i that be the question whether he will yield 
and do king Edward fealty or no 

what talk you lord he shall subscribe to that 
or no condition I will accept at all 

let he be bind my lord to pay your grace 
towards your expense since your come over 
seaventie fine thousand crown of the sun 
and yearly after fifty thousand more 
during your life with homage there withal 
that he do hold his royalty from you 
and take his offer it will not be amiss

and so thou have thy answer to requite 
thy pain herein we give to thou this cup 

health and increase of honour wait on Edward 

lord Howard bring the Frenchman on his way 

king Lewis be one that never be precise 
but now lord Howard and Tom Sellinger 
there be a task remain for you to do 
and that be this you two shall be disguise 
and one of you repair to Burgundy 
the other to the constable of France 
where you shall learn in secret if you can

or how they take this our accord with France 
somewhat it give i you will bring from thence

to think you have be at so great a charge 
and toil your royal self so far from home 
upon the unconstant promise of those man 
that both dissemble with your grace and i 

brother of France you may condemn we right 
not only of great wrong and toil sustain 
but of exceed folly if incite 
we have presume to enter these dominion 
upon no other reason then the word 
and weak assistance of the earl S Paul 
or Burgundy persuasion it be our right 
that wing the body of compose war 
and though we listen to their flattery 
yet so we shape the course of our affair 
as of ourself we may be able find 
without the trust to a break staff 

I know your majesty have more discretion 
but this be not the occasion of our meeting 
if you be please to entertain a peace 
my kingly brother in the sight of these 
and of the alldiscovering eye of heaven 
let we embrace for as my life I swear 
I tender England and your happiness 

the like do I by you and warlike France 
but princely brother ere this knot be knit 
there be some few condition to be sign 
that do I be as ready as yourself 

fair brother let we hear they what they be 

herald repeat the article 

first it be covenant that Lewis king of France accord to the custom of his predecessor shall do homage to king Edward king of England as his sovereign and true heir to all the dominion of France 

How as his sovereign that be to depose 
and quite bereave he of his diadem 
will kingly Lewis stoop to such vassalage 

Bourbon and if he will not let he choose 

brother have patience Bourbon seal your lip 
and interrupt not these high consequent 
forward herald what be else demand 

second it be covenant that Lewis king of France shall pay unto Edward king of England immediate upon the agreement betwixt their majesty seaventie five thousand crown of the sun towards the charge king Edward have be at since his arrival in these part of France 

mort dieu he will neither leave he crown nor coin 

Bourbon I say be silent herald read on 

third and last it be covenant that over and beside those seaventie five thousand crown of the sun now present to be pay Lewis king of France shall yearly hereafter during the life of Edward king of England pay fifty thousand crown more without fraud or guile to be tender at his majesty castle common call the tower of London 

nay bind he that he bring his lordship a couple of 
capon too every year beside 
here be a peace indeed far worse than war 

brother of France be you resolve to do 
accord as you hear the covenant draw 

brother of England mount your royal throne 
for subject weal and glory of my god 
and to deal just with the world beside 
know your title to be lineal 
from the great Edward of that name the three 
your predecessor thus I do resign 
give my crown and sceptre to your hand 
as a obedient liegeman to your grace 

the same do I deliver back again 
with as large interest as you have before 
now for the other covenant 

those my lord 
shall likewise be perform with expedition 
and ever after as you have prescribe 
the yearly pension shall be true pay 

swear on this book king Lewis so help you God 
you mean no otherwise than you have say 

so help i God as I dissemble not 

and so help he i as I intend to keep 
unfeigned league and truce with noble France 
and kingly brother now to consummate 
this happy day feast in our royal tent 
english and french be one so it be mean 

a peace conclude say thou be it not so 

my lord I do assure you it be so 

and thou affirm the like say do thou not 

I do my lord and that for certainty 

I have find it now the villain constable 
have secret with Edward thus compact 
to join our king and he in amity 
and thereby doubtless get into his hand 
such land and dukedom as I aim at 
and leave i disappoint in my hope 
a plague upon such crafty cozen 
now shall I be a mark for they to aim at 
and that boil slave to triumph in my toil 

it be so for it can be no otherwise 
Burgundy have be privy to this plot 
conspire with Lewis and the english king 
to save his own stake and assure himself 
of all those seigneury I hope for 
and thereupon this close peace be contrive 
now must the constable be as a butt 
for all their bullet to be level at 
hell and hot vengeance light on Burgundie 
for this his subtle secret villainy 

well fellow for thy pain take that 
leave i alone for I be much displease 

and get thou go my friend there be for thy pain to Howard 
so leave i to myself 

fare you well sir I hope I have pepper you 

and so I think have I my constable 

now constable this peace this peace 
what think you of it man 

nay rather what think Burgundy 

I think he that do contrive the same 
be little less than a dissemble villain 

dog bite thyself come on come on 
have not you play john for the king 
to save yourself sir 

ay be thou good at that 
adieu sir I may chance to hit you pat 

you may sir I perhaps may be before you 
and for this cunning through the nose to bore you 

so Sellinger we then perceive by thou 
the duke be pass angry at our league 

ay my dread lord beyond comparison 
like a mad dog snatch at every one 
that pass by shall I but show you how 
and act the manner of his tragic fury 

no stay a while methinks I hear thou say 
they mean to greet we by their messenger 

they do my lord 

what and the constable too 

my sovereign yes 

but how take he the news 

faith even as discontent as may be 
but be a more deep melancholist 
and sullen of temper then the duke 
he chaw his malice fume and froth at mouth 
utter but little more than what we gather 
by his disturb look and rivel front 
save that now and then his boil passion 
damn up as in a furnace find vent 
break through his severe lip into short puss 
and then he mumble forth a word or two 
as do a toothless monk when he be at matin 

o it be sport alone to note their carriage 

sport my lord will you but hear i speak 
and if I do not weary you with laughter 
never trust Tom Sellinger more upon his word 

I pray thou peace by this it shall appear 
one of their messenger be come go see 
upon my life we shall have some devise 
of new dissimulation how now Tom 

it be as your highness do suppose my lord 
here be a messenger from Burgundy 

excellent good admit he present 
and brother of France let i entreat your grace 
to stand aside a little in my tent 
lest find we together he refrain 
to tell the message he be send about 
so sure I be persuade we shall find 
some notable piece of knavery set a foot 

with all my heart urge he speak loud enough 
that I my lord may understand he too 

fear not I have the method in my mind 
what it be you my lord of Conte welcome 
how do the valiant duke in health I hope 

in health my lord of body though in mind 
somewhat distemper that your grace have join 
in league with his profess enemy 

How say you that my lord pray you speak out 
for I of late by reason of a cold 
be somewhat thick of hear 

thus my lord 
your grace demand if the duke be well 
I answer you he be in health of body 
though inward in mind somewhat perplex 
that you without his knowledge have take truce 
with childish lewes that heartless king of France 

with who I pray you a little loud sir 

with childish lewes that heartless K of France 

I now do understand you be it that 
he take unkind why if he have come 
with his expect force as he promise 
I have be still uncapable of peace 
but he deceive i the fault be he 

no my good lord the fault be not in he 
but in that lewd pernicious counterfeit 
that crafty fore the constable of France 
who counsel he to keep he at his siege 
say it will be more dishonourable 
to rise from thence than any way profitable 
to meet your majesty beside my lord 
it have be prove since how much the constable 
hate your proceed by that wilful shot 
be make against you from S Quintin wall 
which though he seem to colour with fair speech 
the truth be they do level at yourself 
and grieve when they hear you be not slay 

may I be bold to credit your report 

the duke upon his honour bid i say 
that it be true and there withal quoth he 
tell noble Edward if he will recant 
and fall from Lewes again know it be 
more for his dignity to be sole king 
and conquer France as do his ancestor 
then take a fee and so be satisfy 
that I be ready with twelve thousand soldier 
all well appoint and not only will 
deliver he the constable of France 
that he may punish he as he see good 
but seat he in the throne imperial 
which now another base do usurp 

speak that again I hear not your last word 

but seat you in the throne imperial 
which now another base do usurp 

I thank his honour for his good regard 
please you stay till we have pause upon it 
and you shall have our answer to the duke 
tom Sellinger receive he to your tent 
and let he taste a cup of Orleans wine 
now my kingly brother have you hear this news 

so plain my lord that I scarce hold myself 
from step forth hear my royal name 
so much profane and slubber as it be 
but I do weigh the person like himself 
from whence it come a sly dissembler 
and spite my anger I be force sometime 
to smile to think the duke do hang his friend 
behind his back who to his face he smooth 

but we shall have far better sport anon 
Howard tell i that another messenger 
be come in posthaste from the constable 
as you have begin with patience hear the rest 

no more ado I will to my place again 
remember that you still be deaf my lord 

I warrant you Howard call in the messenger 

health to the victorious king of England 

tell he he must strain out his voice aloud 
for I be somewhat deaf and can hear 

his majesty request you to speak out 
because his hear be of late decay 

the worthy earl S Paul 

Come near i 

the worthy earl S Paul greet noble Edward 
And give your grace to understand by i 
that whereas Charles that paint sepulchre 
and most disloyal duke of Burgundy 
have but usurp the habit of a friend 
be in heart your deadly enemy 
as well appear in his false breach of promise 
and that whereas he never mean himself 
to send you aid but likewise be the mean 
to hinder my lord well affect duty 
allege you desire his company 
but that you may betray he to his king 
beside whereas it will be proud my lord 
that he do hire the gunner of S Quintin 
for a large sum of money to discharge 
three several piece of great ordnance 
upon your come to that curse town 
to slay your majesty in which regard 
if it will please you to revoke from France 
and think of Burgundy as he deserve 
the duke with expedition bid i say 
that he will put the earl into your hand 
whereby you may revenge his treacherous purpose 
and aid you too with twice five thousand man 
and seat you like a conqueror in France 

can it seem possible that two such friend 
so firm knit together as they be 
shall on a sudden now be such great foe 

the earl my lord can never abide the duke 
since his last treason against your sacred person 
before saint Quintin come to open light 

be that the cause of their dissension then 

it be my lord 

well I will think upon it 
and you shall have our answer by and by 
cousin Howard take he aside 
but let he be keep from the other sight 

sir will you walk in my lord will take advice 
and so dispatch you back again unto the earl 

here be buy of villainy who shall have all 
fraud with deceit deceit with fraud outface 
I will the devil be there to cry swoopstake 
but how intend your grace to deal with they 

faith in their kind I be the steel you see 
against the which their envy be strike 
the sparkle of hypocrisy fly forth 
it be not amiss to quench they in their blood 

my lord here be letter to your majesty one from the duke of Burgundy the other from the constable 

more villainy a thousand crown to nothing 

can there be more than be already broach 
we think they have already do so well 
as this may serve to bring they both to hell 

no no they be indifferent well load 
but yet their fraught not full see other ware 
other provision to prepare their way 
the very same my lord which they pretend 
in love to you against my life and crown 
the same they undertake to do for i 
against your safety urge if I please 
that they will join their force both with i 
and in your back return to Calais cut the throat 
of you and all your soldier 

o damnable 
but that I see it figure in these line 
I will have swear there have be nothing leave 
for their pernicious brain to work upon 

a traitor be like a boldfaced hypocrite 
that never will be bring unto a nonplus 
so long as he have liberty to speak 

the way to cure they be to cut they off 
call forth their messenger once more to we 

both of they my lord 

yes both together 
we will see if they have grace to blush or no 
at that their master shame now to attempt 

what be his majesty of France so near 
And monsieur Rosse the earl secretary 
I fear some hurt depend upon his presence 

how come it that I see the french king here 
I and the lord of county too methinks 
pray God our message be not make a scorn

which he intend for our benefit 

no more than he be willing to perform 

know you his handwriting if you see it 

I do my lord 

be this his hand or not 

I can say but that it be his hand 

how come it then that underneath his hand 
my death be seek when you that be his mouth 
tune to our ear a quite contrary tale 
the like read you decipher in this paper 
concern treacherous waver Burgundy 
unless you grant they can divide themselves 
and of two shape become four substance 
how be it I shall have their knightly aid 
and yet by they be utter destroy 

and I to be protect by their mean 
and yet they shall conspire against my life 

what call you this but vile hypocrisy 

nay peasantlike unheard of treachery 

my lord upbraid not i with this offence 
I do protest I know of no such letter 
nor any other intention of the duke 
more than before be utter in my message
