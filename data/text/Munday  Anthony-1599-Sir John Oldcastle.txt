which may break out into rebellious arm 
when the king be go perchance before he go 
note as a instance this one perilous fray 
what faction may have grow on either part 
to the destruction of the king and realm 
yet in my conscience sir john Oldcastle 
innocent of it only his name be use 
we therefore from his highness give this charge 
you master mayor look to your citizen 
you master sheriff unto your shire and you 
as justice in every one precinct 
there be no meeting when the vulgar sort 
sit on their alebench with their cup and can

my noble lord no more than what you know

grievous complaint have pass between the lip 
of envious person to upbraid the clergy 
some carp at the live which we have 
and other spurn at the ceremony 
that be of ancient custom in the church 
among the which lord Cobham be a chief 
what inconvenience may proceed hereof 
both to the king and to the common wealth 
may easy be discern when like a frenzy 
this innovation shall possess their mind 
these upstart will have follower to uphold 
their damn opinion more than Harry shall 
to undergo his quarrel against the french 

what proof be there against they to be have 
that what you say the law may justify 

they give themselves the name of protestant 
and meet in field and solitary grove 

be ever hear my lord the like till now 
that thief and rebel 'sblood heretic 
plain heretic I will stand to it to their tooth 
shall have to colour their vile practise 
a title of such worth as protestant enter one with a letter 

o but you must not swear it ill become 
one of your coat to rap out bloody oath 

pardon he good my lord it be his zeal 
a honest country prelate who lament 
to see such foul disorder in the church 

there be one they call he sir john Oldcastle 
he have not his name for nought for like a castle 
do he encompass they within his wall 
but till that castle be subvert quite 
we never shall be at quiet in the realm 

that be our suit my lord that he be take 
and bring in question for his heresy 
beside two letter bring i out of Wales 
wherein my lord Herford write to i 
what tumult and sedition be begin 
about the lord Cobham at the assize there 
for they have much ado to calm the rage 
and that the valiant Herbert be there slay 

a fire that must be quench well say no more 
the king anon go to the counsel chamber 
there to debate of matter touch France 
as he do pass by I will inform his grace 
concern your petition master butler 
if I forget do you remember i 

I will my lord offer he a purse 

not for a recompense 
but as a token of our love to you 
by i my lord of the clergy do present 
this purse and in it full a thousand angel 
pray your lordship to accept their gift 

I thank they my lord bishop for their love 
but will not take their money if you please 
to give it to this gentleman you may 

sir than we crave your furtherance herein 

the best I can my lord of Rochester 

nay pray you take it trust i but you shall 

be you all three upon new market heath 
you shall not need strain curtsy who shall have it 
sir john will quick rid you of that care 

the king be come fear you not my lord 
the very first thing I will break with he 
shall be about your matter enter K Harry and Huntington in talk 

my lord of Suffolk 
be it not say the clergy do refuse 
to lend we money towards our war in France 

it be my lord but very wrongful 

I know it be for Huntington here tell i 
they have be very bountiful of late 

and still they vow my gracious lord to be so 
hope your majesty will think of they 
as of your love subject and suppress 
all such malicious error as begin 
to spot their call and disturb the church 

God else forbid why Suffolk be there 
any new rupture to disquiet they 

no new my lord the old be great enough 
and so increase as if not cut down 
will breed a scandal to your royal state 
and set your kingdom quick in a uproar 
the kentish knight lord Cobham in despite 
of any law or spiritual discipline 
maintain this upstart new religion still 
and diverse great assembly by his mean 
and private quarrel be commence abroad 
as by this letter more at large my liege 
be make apparent 

we do find it here 
there be in Wales a certain fray of late 
between two nobleman but what of this 
follow it straight lord Cobham must be he 
do cause the same I dare be swear good knight 
he never dream of any such contention 

but in his name the quarrel do begin 
about the opinion which he hold my hege 

how if it do be either he in place 
to take part with they or abet they in it 
if brabble fellow who in kindle blood 
seethe in their fiery vein will needs go fight 
make their quarrel of some word that pass 
either of you or you among their cup 
be the fault you or be they guilty of it 

with pardon of your highness my dread lord 
such little spark neglect may in time 
grow to a mighty flame but that be not all 
he do beside maintain a strange religion 
and will not be compel to come to mass 

we do beseech you therefore gracious prince 
without offence unto your majesty 
we may be bold to use authority 

as how 

to summon he unto the arch 
where such offence have their punishment 

to answer personal be that your meaning 

it be my lord 

how if he appeal 

he can my lord in such a case as this 

not where religion be the plea my lord 

I take it always that ourself stand out 
as a sufficient refuge unto who 
not any but might lawful appeal 
but we will not argue now upon that point 
for sir john Oldcastle who you accuse 
let i entreat you to dispense awhile 
with your high title of preeminence in scorn 
report do never yet condemn he so 
but he have always be repute loyal 
and in my knowledge I can say thus much 
that he be virtuous wise and honourable 
if any way his conscience be seduce 
to waver in his faith I will send for he 
and school he private if that serve not 
then afterward you may proceed against he 
butler be you the messenger for we 
and will he present repair to court exeunt 

how now my lord why stand you discontent 
in sooth methinks the king have well decree 

yea yea sir john if he will keep his word 
but I perceive he favour he so much 
as this will be to small effect I fear 

why then I will tell you what you be best to do 
if you suspect the king will be but cold 
in reprehend he send you a process too 
to serve upon he so you may be sure 
to make he answer it howsoever it fall 

and well remember I will have it so 
a sumner shall be send about it straight exit 

yea do so in the mean space this remain 
for kind sir john of Wrotham honest Jack 
methinks the purse of gold the bishop give 
make a good show it have a tempt look 
beshrew i but my finger end do itch 
to be upon those ruddock well it be thus 
I be not as the world do take i for 
if ever wolf be clothe in sheep coat 
than I be he old huddle and twang i'faith 
a priest in show but in plain term a thief 
yet let i tell you too a honest thief 
one that will take it where it may besp 
and spend it free in good fellowship 
I have as many shape as Proteus have 
that still when any villainy be do 
there may be none suspect it be sir john 
beside to comfort i for what be this life 
except the crabbed bitterness thereof 
be sweeten now and then with lechery 
I have my doll my concubine as it be 
to frolic with a lusty bounce girl 
but while I loiter here the gold may escape 
and that must not be so it be my own 
therefore I will meet he on his way to court 
and shrive he of it there will be the sport Exit 

God help God help there be law for punish 
but there be no law for our necessity

than there be house to relieve they at 

faith housekeeping decay in every place 
even as saint Peter write still worse and worse

it be a hard world the while 

if a poor man come to a door to ask for god sake they ask he for a licence or a certificate from a justice 

faith we have none but what we bear upon our body our maim limb God help we 

and yet as lame as I be I will with the king into France if I can crawl but a shipboard I have rather be slay in France than starve in England

my gracious lord unto your majesty 
next unto my god I owe my life 
and what be i either by nature gift 
or fortune bounty all be at your service 
but for obedience to the pope of Rome 
I owe he none nor shall his shaveling priest

and fill our ear with frivolous complaint 
be this the duty you do bear to we 
be it not sufficient we do pass our word 
to send for he but you misdoubt it 
or which be worse intend to forestall 
our regal power must likewise summon he 
This savour of ambition not of zeal 
and rather prove you malice his estate 
than any way that he offend the law 
go to we like it not and he your officer 
that be employ so much amiss herein 
have his desert for be insolent enter Huntington 
so Cobham when you please you may depart 

I humble bid farewell unto my liege exit 

farewell what be the news by Huntington 

sir Roger Acton and a crew my lord 
of bold seditious rebel be in arm 
intend reformation of religion 
and with their army they intend to pitch 
in ficket field unless they be repulse 

so near our presence dare they be so bold 
and will proud war and eager thirst of blood 
who we have think to entertain far off 
press forth upon we in our native bound 
must we be force to handsel our sharp blade 
in England here which we prepare for France 
well a god name be it what be their number say 
or who be the chief commander of this rout 

their number be not know as yet my lord 
but it be report sir john Oldcastle 
be the chief man on who they do depend 

how the lord Cobham 

yes my gracious lord 

I can have tell your majesty as much 
before he go but that I see your grace 
be too much blind by his flattery 

Send post my lord to fetch he back again 

traitor unto his country how he smooth 
and seem as innocent as truth itself 

I can think it yet he will be false 
but if he be no matter let he go 
we will meet both he and they unto their woe 

This fall out well and at the last I hope exeunt 
to see this heretic die in a rope 

once more my lord of Cambridge make rehearsal 
how you do stand entitle to the crown 
the deep shall we print it in our mind 
and every man the better be resolve 
when he perceive his quarrel to be just 

then thus lord Scroop sir Thomas grey and you 
monsieur de chartres agent for the french 
this Lionel duke of Clarence as I say 
three son of Edward England king the three 
have issue Philip his sole daughter and heir 
which Philip afterward be give in marriage 
to Edmund Mortimer the earl of march 
and by he have a son call Roger Mortimer 
which Roger likewise have of his descent 
Edmund Roger Anne and Elinor 
two daughter and two son but those three 
die without issue anne that do survive 
and now be leave her father only heir 
my fortune be to marry be too 
by my grandfather of king Edward line 
so of his surname I be call you know 
Richard Plantagenet my father be 
Edward the duke of York and son and heir 
to Edmund Langley Edward the three first son 

so that it seem your claim come by your wife 
as lawful heir to Roger Mortimer 
the son of Edmund which do marry Philip 
daughter and heir to Lionel duke of Clarence 

true for this Harry and his father both 
harry the first as plain do appear 
be false intruder and usurp the crown 
for when young Richard be at Pomfret slay 
in he the title of prince Edward die 
that be the elder of king Edward son 
William of Hatfield and their second brother 
death in his nonage have before bereave 
so that my wife derive from Lionel 
three son unto king Edward ought proceed 
and take possession of the diadem 
before this Harry or his father king 
who fetch their title but from Lancaster 
forth of that royal line And be thus 
what reason be it but she shall have her right 

I be resolve our enterprise be just 

Harry shall die or else resign his crown 

perform but that and Charles the king of France 
shall aid you lord not only with his man 
but send you money to maintain your war 
five hundred thousand crown he bid i proffer 
if you can stop but Harry voyage for France 

we never have a fit time than now 
the realm in such division as it be 

beside you must persuade you there be due 
vengeance for Richard murder which although 
it be defend yet will it fall at last 
and now as likely as another time 
sin have have many year to ripen in 
and now the harvest can be far off 
wherein the weed of usurpation 
be to be crop and cast into the fire 

no more earl Cambridge here I plight my faith 
to set up thou and thy renown wife 

Gray will perform the same as he be knight 

and to assist you as I say before 
Charters do gauge the honour of his king 

we lack but now lord Cobham fellowship 
and then our plot be absolute indeed 

doubt not of he my lord his life be pursue 
by the incense clergy and of late 
bring in displeasure with the king assure 
he may be quick win unto our faction 
who have the article be draw at large 
of our whole purpose 

that have I my lord 

we shall not now be far off from his house 
our serious conference have beguile the way 
see where his castle stand give i the writing 
when we be come unto the speech of he 
because we will not stand to make recount 
of that which have be say here he shall read enter Cob 
our mind at large and what we crave of he 

a ready way here come the man himself 
boot and spur it seem he have be ride 

well meet lord Cobham 

my lord of Cambridge 
your honour be most welcome into Kent 
and all the rest of this fair company 
I be new come from London gentle lord 
but will you not take Cowling for your host 
and see what entertainment it afford 

we be intend to have be your guest 
but now this lucky meeting shall suffice 
to end our business and defer that kindness 

business my lord what business shall you have 
but to be merry we have no delicate 
but this I will promise you a piece of venison 
a cup of wine and so forth hunter fare 
and if you please we will strike the stag ourselves 
shall fill our dish with his wellfed flesh 

that be indeed the thing we all desire 

my lord and you shall have your choice with i 

nay but the stag which we desire to strike 
live not in Cowling if you will consent 
and go with we we will bring you to a forest 
where run a lusty herd among the which 
there be a stag superior to the rest 
a stately beast that when his fellow run 
he lead the race and beat the sullen earth 
as though he scorn it with his trample hoof 
aloft he bear his head and with his breast 
like a huge bulwark countercheck the wind 
and when he stand still he stretch forth 
his proud ambitious neck as if he mean 
to wound the firmament with fork horn 

it be pity such a goodly beast shall die 

not so sir john for he be tyrannous 
and gore the other deer and will not keep 
within the limit be appoint he 
of late he be break into a several 
which do belong to i and there he spoil 
both corn and pasture two of his wild race 
alike for stealth and covetous encroach 
already be remove if he be dead 
I shall not only be secure from hurt 
but with his body make a royal feast 

How say you then will you first hunt with we 

faith lord I like the pastime where be the place 

peruse this writing it will show you all 
and what occasion we have for the sport he read 

call you this hunt my lord be this the stag 
you fain will chase harry our dread king 
so we may make a banquet for the devil 
and in the stead of wholesome meat prepare 
a dish of poison to confound ourselves 

why so lord Cobham see you not our claim 
and how imperious he hold the crown 

besides you know yourself be in disgrace 
hold as a recreant and pursue to death 
this will defend you from your enemy 
and establish your religion through the land 

notorious treason yet I will conceal aside 
my secret thought to sound the depth of it 
my lord of Cambridge I do see your claim 
and what good may redound unto the land 
by prosecute of this enterprise 
but where be man where be power and furniture 
to order such a action we be weak 
Harry you know be a mighty potentate 

tut we be strong enough you be belove 
and many will be glad to follow you 
we be the light and some will follow we 
beside there be hope from France here be a ambassador 
that promise both man and money too 
the commons likewise as we hear pretend 
a sudden tumult we will join with they 

some likelihood I must confess to speed 
but how shall I believe this be plain truth 
you be my lord such man as live in court 
and high have be favour of the king 
especial lord Scroop who oftentimes 
he make choice of for his bedfellow 
and you lord grey be of his privy council 
be not this a train to entrap my life 

then perish may my soul what think you so 

we will swear to you 

or take the sacrament 

nay you be noble man and I imagine 
as you be honourable by birth and blood 
so you will be in heart in thought in word

my lord of Rochester on good advice 
I see my error but yet understand i 
I mean not error in the faith I hold

therefore your lordship without more to do 
must be a mean to help i to escape 

what mean thou heretic

I beseech you good my lord of Rochester be favourable to my lord and master 

the inner room be very hot and close 
I do not like this air here in the tower

club club club 

murder murder murder 

down with he they fight 

a villain traitor 

you cowardly rogue sir john escape 

who be so bold as dare to draw a sword 
so near unto the entrance of the tower 

this ruffian servant to sir john Oldcastle be like to have slay my lord 

Lay hold on he 

stand off if you love your pudding 

help help help m lieutenant help 

who be that within some treason in the tower upon my life look in who be that which call enter Roch bind 

without your cloak my lord of Rochester 

there now it work then let i speed for now be the fit time for i to escape away exit 

why do you look so ghastly and affright 

Oldcastle that traitor and his man 
when you have leave i to confer with he 
take bind and strip i as you see 
and leave i lie in his inner chamber 
and so depart and I 

and you never say that the lord Cobham man 
do here set upon you like to murder you 

and so he do 

it be upon his master than he do 
that in the brawl the traitor may escape 

where be this Harpoole 

here he be even now 

where can you tell they be both escape 
since it so happen that he be escape 
I be glad you be a witness of the same 
it may have else be lay unto my charge 
that I have be consent to the fact 

Come search shall be make for he with expedition the haven lay that he shall not escape and hue and cry continue through England to find this damn dangerous heretic exeunt 

in my opinion Scroop have well advise 
poison will be the only apt mean 
and fit for our purpose to dispatch he 

but yet there may be doubt in their delivery 
Harry be wise therefore earl of Cambridge 
I judge that way not so convenient 

what think you then of this I be his bedfellow 
and unsuspected nightly sleep with he 
what if I venture in those silent hour 
when sleep have seal up all mortal eye 
to murder he in bed how like you that 

herein consist no safety for yourself 
and you disclose what shall become of we 
but this day as you know he will aboard 
the wind so fair and set away for France 
if as he go or enter in the ship 
it may be do than it be excellent 

why any of these or if you will 
I will cause a present sit of the council 
wherein I will pretend some matter of such weight 
as needs must have his royal company 
and to dispatch he in the council chamber 

tush yet I hear not any thing to purpose 
I wonder that lord Cobham stay so long 
his counsel in this case will much avail we 

what shall we rise thus and determine nothing 

that be a shame indeed no sit again 
and you shall have my counsel in this case 
if you can find no way to kill this king 
than you shall see how I can further you 
Scroope way by poison be indifferent 
but yet be bedfellow unto the king 
and unsuspected sleep in his bosom 
in my opinion that be the likely way 
for such false friend be able to do much 
and silent night be treason fit friend 
now Cambridge in his set hence for France 
or by the way or as he go aboard 
to do the deed that be indifferent too 
yet somewhat doubtful may I speak my mind 
for many reason needless now to urge 
marry lord grey come something near the point 
to have the king at council and there murder he 
as Caesar be among his dear friend 
none like to that if all be of his mind 
tell i o tell i you bright honour stain 
for which of all my kindness to you 
be you become thus traitor to your king 
and France must have the spoil of Harry life 

o pardon we dread lord all kneel 

How pardon you that be a sin indeed 
drag they to death which just they deserve they lead they away 
and France shall dear buy this villainy 
so soon as we set foot on her breast 
God have the praise for our deliverance 
and next our thanks lord Cobham be to thou 
true perfect mirror of nobility exeunt 

sir you be welcome to this house to such as here be with all my heart but by the mass I fear your lodging will be the worst l have but two bed and they be both in a chamber and the carrier and his daughter lie in the one and you and your wife must lie in the other
