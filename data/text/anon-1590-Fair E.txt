what mean fair Britain mighty conqueror 
so sudden to cast away his staff 
and all in passion to forsake the tilt 

my lord this triumph we solemnise here 
be for mere love to your increase joy 
only expect cheerful look for all 
what sudden pang then move your majesty 
to dim the brightness of the day with frown 

ah good my lord misconstrue not the cause 
at least suspect not my displease brow 
I amorous do bear to your intent 
for thank and all that you can wish I yield 
but that which make i blush and shame to tell 
be cause why thus I turn my conquer eye 
to coward look and beat fantasy 

since we be guiltless we the less dismay 
to see this sudden change possess your cheer 
for if it issue from your own conceit 
breed by suggestion of some envious thought 
your highness wisdom may suppress it straight 
yet tell we good my lord what thought it be 
that thus bereave you of your late content 
that in advice we may assist your grace 
or bend our force to revive your spirit 

ah marquis Lubeck in thy power it lie 
to rid my bosom of these thrall dump 
and therefore good my lord forbear awhile 
that we may parley of these private care 
who strength subdue i more than all the world 

we go and wish thou private conference 
public affect in this accustom peace 

now marquis must a conqueror at arm 
disclose himself thrall to unarm thought 
and threaten of a shadow yield to lust 
no soon have my sparkle eye behold 
the flame of beauty blaze on this piece 
but sudden a sense of miracle 
imagine on thy lovely mistress face 
make i abandon bodily regard 
and cast all pleasure on my wound soul 
then gentle marquis tell i what she be 
that thus thou honour on thy warlike shield 
and if thy love and interest be such 
as just may give place to my 
that if it be my soul with honour wing 
may fly into the bosom of my dear 
if not close they and stoop into my grave 

if this be all renown conqueror 
advance your droop spirit and revive 
the wont courage of your conquer mind 
for this fair picture paint on my shield 
be the true counterfeit of lovely Blanch 
princess and daughter to the king of Dane 
who beauty and excess of ornament 
deserve another manner of defence 
pomp and high person to attend her state 
than marquis Lubeck any way present 
therefore her virtue I resign to thou 
already shrine in thy religious breast 
to be advance and honour to the full 
nor bear I this a argument of love 
but to renown fair Blanch my sovereign child 
in every place where I by arm may do it 

ah marquis thy word bring heaven unto my soul 
and have I heaven to give for thy reward 
thou shall be throne in no unworthy place 
but let my uttermost wealth suffice thy worth 
which here I vow and to aspire the bliss 
that hang on quick achievement of my love 
thyself and I will travel in disguise 
to bring this lady to our Britain court 

let William but bethink what may avail 
and let i die if I deny my aid 

then thus the duke Dirot and the earl Dimach 
will I leave substitute to rule my realm 
while mighty love forbid my be here 
and in the name of sir Robert of Windsor 
will go with thou unto the danish court 
keep William secret marquis if thou love he 
bright Blanch I come sweet fortune favour i 
and I will laud thy name eternal 

Come daughter we must learn to shake off pomp 
to leave the state that erst beseem a knight 
and gentleman of no mean descent 
to undertake this homely miller trade 
thus must we mask to save our wretched life 
threaten by conquest of this hapless isle 
who sad invasion by the conqueror 
have make a number such as we subject 
their gentle neck unto their stubborn yoke 
of drudge labour and base peasantry 
sir Thomas Goddard now old Goddard be 
Goddard the miller of fair Manchester 
why shall not I content i with this state 
as good sir Edmund Trofferd do the flail 
and thou sweet Em must stoop to high estate 
to join with i that thus we may protect 
our harmless life which lead in great port 
will be a envious object to our foe 
that seek to root all Britain gentry 
from bear countenance against their tyranny

wherein true gentry be the only mean 
that make we differ from base miller bear

nor thirst in soul for former sovereignty

now requisite now that I know thy mind 
something incline to favour Manvile suit 
a gentleman thy lover in protest 
and that thou may not be by love deceive 
but try his meaning fit for thy desert 
in pursuit of all amorous desire 
regard thy honour let not vehement sigh 
nor earnest vow import fervent love 
render thou subject to the wrath of lust 
for that transform to former sweet delight 
will bring thy body and thy soul to shame 
chaste thought and modest conversation 
of proof to keep out all enchant vow 
vain sigh force tear and pitiful aspect 
be they that make deform lady fair

or unjust to the marquis Lubeck 
I will as do the constant lady Penelope 
undertake to effect some great task 

what of all this 

the next time that sir Robert shall come 
in his wont sort to solicit i with love 
I will seem to agree and like of any thing 
that the knight shall demand so far forth 
as it be no impeachment to my chastity 
and to conclude point some place for to meet the man 
for my conveyance from the Denmark court 
which determine upon he will appoint some certain time 
for our departure whereof you have intelligence 
you may soon set down a plot to wear the english crown 
and then

I honour you with such religious zeal 
as may become a honourable mind 
nor may I make my love the siege of Troy

to wrong my chaste determination

incense with more than ordinary love 
be such for to deprive thou of thy life 
thou have not live to brave i as thou do wretch as thou be 
wherein have Valingford offend thou 
that honourable bond which late we do confirm

till now too much abuse by thy villainy 
I be enforce to cancel all those band 
by hate he which I so well do love 

subtle thou be and cunning in thy fraud 
that give i occasion of offence 
thou pick a quarrel to excuse thy shame 
why Valingford be it not enough for thou 
to be a rival betwixt i and my love 
but counsel she to my no small disgrace 
that when I come to talk with she of love 
she shall seem deaf as feign not to hear 

but have she Mountney use thou as thou say 

thou know too well she have 
wherein thou can not do i great injury 

then I perceive we be delude both 
for when I offer many gift of gold and jewel 
to entreat for love she have refuse they with a coy disdain 
allege that she can not see the sun 
the same conjecture I to be thy drift 
that feign so she may be rid of i

and let the prisoner under several guard 
be keep apart until you hear from we 
let this suffice you know my resolution 
if William duke of saxon be the man 
that by his answer send we he will send 
not word but wound not parley but alarm 
must be decider of this controversy 
Rosilio stay with i the rest begone exeunt 

all but Demarch go shroud you out of sight 
for I will go parley with the prince myself 

shall Zweno by this parley call you forth 
upon intent injurious to deal 
this offer too much opportunity 

no no Demarch that be a breach 
against the law of arm therefore begone 
and leave we here alone exeunt 
I see that Zweno be master of his word 
Zweno William of Saxony greet thou 
either well or ill accord to thy intent 
if well thou wish to he and Saxony 
he bid thou friendly welcome as he can 
if ill thou wish to he and Saxony 
he must withstand thy malice as he may 

William for other name and title give I none 
to he who be he worthy of those honour 
that fortune and his predecessor leave 
I ought by right and human courtesy 
to grace his style with duke of Saxony 
but for I find a base degenerate mind 
I frame my speech accord to the man 
and not the state that he unworthy hold 

herein Zweno do thou abase thy state 
to break the peace which by our ancestor 
have heretofore be honourable keep 

and shall that peace for ever have be keep 
have not thyself be author of the breach 
nor stand it with the honour of my state 
or nature of a father to his child 
that I shall so be rob of my daughter 
and not unto the utmost of my power 
revenge so intolerable a injury 

be this the colour of your quarrel Zweno 
I well perceive the wise man may err 
and think you I convey away your daughter Blanch 

be thou so impudent to deny thou do 
when that the proof thereof be manifest 

what proof be there 

thy own confession be sufficient proof 

do I confess I steal your daughter Blanch 

thou do confess thou have a lady hence 

I have and do 

why that be Blanch my daughter 

nay that be Mariana 
who wrongful thou detain prisoner 

shameless persist in thy ill 
thou do maintain a manifest untruth 
as she shall justify unto thy tooth 
Rosilio fetch she and the marquis hither 

it can be I shall be so deceive 

I hear this night among the soldier 
that in their watch they take a pensive lady 
who at the appointment of the lord Dirot be yet in keep 
what she be I know not 
only thus much I overhear by chance 

and what of this 

it may be Blanch the king of Denmark daughter 

it may be so but on my life it be not 
yet Demarch go and fetch she straight 

please your highness here be the marquis and Mariana 

see here duke William your competitor 
that be consent to my daughter escape 
let they resolve you of the truth herein 
and here I vow and solemn protest 
that in thy presence they shall lose their head 
unless I hear where as my daughter be 

oh marquis Lubeck how it grieve i 
that for my sake thou shall endure these bond 
be judge my soul that feel the martyrdom 

duke William you know it be for your cause 
it please thus the king to misconceive of i 
and for his pleasure do i injury 

may it please your highness 
here be the lady you send i for 

away Demarch what tell thou i of lady 
I so detest the deal of their sex 
as that I count a lover state to be the base 
and vile slavery in the world 

what humour be these here be a strange alteration 

see duke William be this Blanch or no 
you know she if you see she I be sure 

Zweno I be deceive yea utter deceive 
yet this be she this same be lady Blanch 
and for my error here I be content 
to do whatsoever Zweno shall set down 
ah cruel Mariana thus to use 
the man which love and honour thou with his heart 

when first I come into your highness court 
and William often import i of love 
I do devise to ease the grief your daughter do sustain 
she shall meet sir William mask as I it be 
This put in proof do take so good effect 
as yet it seem his grace be not resolve 
but it be I which he convey away 

may this be true it can be but true 
be it lady Blanch which I convey away 
unconstant Mariana 
thus to deal with he which mean to thou nought but faith 

pardon dear father my folly that be past 
wherein I have neglect i duty 
which I in reverence ought to show your grace 
for lead by love I thus have go astray 
and now repent the error I be in 

stand up dear daughter though thy fault deserve 
for to be punish in the extreme sort 
yet love that cover multitude of sin 
make love in parent wink at child fault 
suffice Blanch thy father love thou so 
thy folly past he know but will not know 
and here duke William take my daughter to thy wife 
for well I be assure she love thou well 

a proper conjunction as who shall say 
late come out of the fire 
I will go thrust myself into the flame 
let mistress nice go saint it where she list 
and coy acquaint it with dissemble face 
I hold in scorn the foolery that they use 
I be free will never subject myself 
to any such as she be underneath the sun 

refuse thou to take my daughter to thy wife 
I tell thou duke this rash denial 
may bring more mischief on thou than thou can avoid 

conceit have wrought such general dislike 
through the false deal of Mariana 
that utter I do abhor their sex 
they be all disloyal unconstant all unjust 
who try as I have try 
and find as I have find 
will say there be no such creature on the ground 

unconstant knight though some deserve no trust 
there be other faithful love loyal and just 

how now lord Valingford what make these woman here 

here be two woman may it please your grace 
that be contract to one man 
and be in strife whether shall have he to their husband 

stand forth woman and say 
to whether of you do he first give his faith 

to i forsooth

speak Manvile to whether do thou give thy faith 

to say the troth this maid have first my love 

yea Manvile but there be no witness by 

thy conscience Manvile a hundred witness 

she have steal a conscience to serve she own turn 
but you be deceive i'faith he will none of you 

in deed dread lord so dear I hold her love 
as in the same I put my whole delight 
but some impediment which at that instant happen 
make i forsake she quite 
for which I have her father frank consent 

what be the impediment 

why she can neither hear nor see 

now she do both maiden how be you cure 

pardon my lord I will tell your grace the troth 
be it not impute to i as discredit 
I love this Manvile so much that still methinks 
when he be absent do present to i 
the form and feature of that countenance 
which I do shrine a idol in my heart 
and never can I see a man methinks 
that equal Manvile in my partial eye 
nor be there any love between we lose 
but that I hold the same in high regard 
until repair of some unto our house 
of who my Manvile grow thus jealous 
as if he take exception I vouchsafe 
to hear they speak or see they when they come 
on which I straight take order with myself 
to void the scruple of his conscience 
by counterfeit that I neither see nor hear 
any way to rid my hand of they 
all this I do to keep my Manvile love 
which he unkind seek for to reward
