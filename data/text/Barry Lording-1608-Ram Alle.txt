close by the widow will I rest all night 
as for my breath I have crotchet and devise 
lady rank breath be often help with spice 

Come straw apace lord shall I never live 
to walk to church on flower o it be fine 
to see a bride trip it to church so light 
as if her new chopine will scorn to bruise

because a little heat make it to spread 
and open wide his leaf 

thou be quite wide 
a marigold do open wide all day 
and shut most close at night I hope thou know

methinks a young clear skin country gentlewoman 
that never see baboon lion or courtier 
may prove a handsome wife or what do you say 
to a citizen daughter that never be in love 
with a player that never learn to dance 
that never dwell near any inn a court 
may not she in time prove a honest wife 
faith take a maid and leave the widow master 
of all meat I love not a gape oyster
