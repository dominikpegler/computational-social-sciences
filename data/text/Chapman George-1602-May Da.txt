think thou I consider not all this he shall come in disguise wench and do thou devise for our mirth what ridiculous disguise he shall come in and he shall assume it 

what a magnifico of the city and one of the senate think thou he will not see into that inconvenience 

no more than no senator for in this case my assurance be that Cupid will take the scarf from his own eye and hoodwink the old buzzard while two other true turtle enjoy their happiness get thou in I beseech thou love tell thy gold and say thy prayer enter Lorenzo now for a far fetch it device to fetch over my lovesquire exit 

I see he within earshot well may beauty inflame other riches may tempt other but for i my ear and my eye be proof against all the siren and Venus in all the sea of the world beauty be a whore riches a bawd and I will trust none a you 

what ail poor Angelo 

nay mistress Frank if you prove disloyal once farewell all constancy in woman 

how now man what be the matter 

o sir be you so near I shall trust your experience in woman the better while I live 

I pray thou why so 

say true sir do you never solicit your lovesuit to fair mistress Francischina 

never I protest Angelo 

upon my life it be a strange thing I will have swear all Italy can not so sudden have fasten a favour upon she I look for a siege of Troy at least to surprise the turret of her continence but to yield at the first sight of her assailant colour and before any cannon be mount afore she it be one of the loose part of a modest woman that ever I hear of 

how say thou do not I tell thou as much beware of a old colt while you live he can tell when to strike I warrant you 

woman and feather now fie on that affinity 

Alas Angelo a feeble generation soon overcome God know the honest mind the soon overcome 

God my life what light huswife will yield at first to a stranger and yet do this whirligig stand upon term of honour forsooth tender her reputation as the apple of her eye she have a jealous and a cut husband envious neighbour and will die many death rather then by any friend open access to she be whip naked with the tongue of scandal and slander and a whole sanctuary of such ceremony 

o she do worthy in that Angelo and like a woman of honour thou have paint her perfection in her fault thou find and tickle i with her appetite 

and to avoid all sight of your entrance you must needs come in some disguise she say so much she tender your high credit in the city and her own reputation forsooth 

how come in some disguise 

a toy a very toy which run in her head with such curious foot sir because if there be any resemblance of your person see to enter her house your whole substantial self will be call in question any other man she say may better adventure with the least thing change about they than you with all as if you be the only note muttonmonger in all the city 

well Angelo heaven forgive we the sin of our youth 

that be true sir but for a paltry disguise be a magnifico she shall go snick up 

soft good Angelo soft let we think on it a little what disguise will serve the turn say she 

faith I know not what disguise she will have for you she will have you come like a calf with a white face I think she talk of tinker pedlar porter chimneysweeper fool and physician such as have free egress and regress into man house without suspicion 

out upon they will she have i undergo the shame and hazard of one of those abject 

i'faith I tell she so a squire of that worship one of the senate a grave justicer a man of wealth a magnifico 

and yet by my troth for the safeguard of her honour I will do much methinks a friar weed be nothing 

out upon it that disguise be wear thread bare upon every stage and so much villainy commit under that habit that it be grow as suspicious as the vile if you will hearken to any take such a transformance as you may be sure will keep you from discovery for though it be the stale refuge of miserable poet by change of a hat or a cloak to alter the whole state of a comedy so as the father must not know his own child forsooth nor the wife her husband yet you must not think they do it earnest to carry it away so for say you be stuff into a motley coat crowd in the case of a base viol or button up in a cloakbag even to your chin yet if I see your face I be able to say this be signior Lorenzo and therefore unless your disguise be such that your face may bear as great a part in it as the rest the rest be nothing 

good reason in faith Angelo and what shall I then smurch my face like a chimney sweeper and wear the rest of his smokiness 

I will tell you sir if you be so mad to condescend to the humour of a foolish woman by consideration that jove for his love take on he the shape of a bull which be far worse than a chimney sweeper I can fit you rare

o let i hug thou Angelo 

a bed as soft as her hair sheet as delicate as her skin and as sweet as her breath pillow imitate her breast and her breast to boot hippocras in her cup and nectar in her lip ah the god have be beast for less felicity 

no more good Angelo no more how shall I requite the happiness thou will bring i too haste any mind of marriage
