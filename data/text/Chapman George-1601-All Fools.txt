can ownself cause in subject so a like 
as you two be produce effect so unlike 
one like the turtle all in mournful strain 
wail his fortune the other like the lark 
mount the sky in shrill and cheerful note 
chant his joy aspire and both for love 
in one love raise by his violent heat 
moist vapour from the heart into the eye 
from whence they drown his breast in daily shower 
in the other his divide power infuse 
only a temperate and most kindly warmth 
that give life to those fruit of wit and virtue 
which the unkind hand of a uncivil father 
have almost nip in the delightsome blossom 

o brother love reward our service 
with a most partial and injurious hand 
if you consider well our different fortune 
Valerio love and joy the dame he love 
I love and never can enjoy the sight 
of she I love so far from conquer 
in my desire assault that I can come 
to lay no battery to the fort I seek 
all passage to it so strong keep 
by straight guard of her father 

I dare swear 
if just desert in love measure reward 
your fortune shall exceed Valerio far 
for I be witness be your bed fellow 
both to the daily and the nightly service 
you do unto the deity of love 
in vow sigh tear and solitary watch 
he never serve he with such sacrifice 
yet have his bow and shaft at his command 
love service be much like our humorous lord 
where minion carry more than servitor 
the bold and careless servant still obtain 
the modest and respective nothing gain 
you never see your love unless in dream 
he Hymen put in whole possession 
what different star reign when your love be bear 
he force to wear the willow you the horn 
but brother be you not ashamed to make 
yourself a slave to the base lord of love 
be get of fancy and of beauty bear 
and what be beauty a mere quintessence 
who life be not in be but in seem 
and therefore be not to all eye the same 
but like a cozen picture which one way 
show like a crow another like a swan 
and upon what ground be this beauty draw 
upon a woman a most brittle creature 
and will to God for my part that be all 

but tell i brother do you never love 

you know I do and be belove again 
and that of such a dame as all man deem 
honour and make i happy in her favour 
exceed fair she be not and yet fair 
in that she never study to be fair 
than nature make she beauty cost she nothing 
her virtue be so rare they will have make 
a Aethiop beautiful at least so think 
by such as stand aloof and do observe she 
with credulous eye but what they be indeed 
I will spare to blaze because I love she once 
only I find her such 〈◊〉 for her sake 
I vow eternal war against their whole sex 
inconstant shuttlecock love fool and 〈◊〉 
man rich in dirt and title soon win 
with the most vile than the most virtuous 
find true to none if one among whole hundred 
chance to be chaste she be so proud withal 
way ward and rude that one of unchaste life 
be oftentimes approve a worthy wife 
undress sluttish nasty to their husband 
sponge up adorn and paint to their lover 
all day in ceaseless uproar with their household 
if all the night their husband have not please they 
like hound most kind be beat and abuse 
like wolf most cruel be kindly use 

fie thou profane the deity of their sex 

brother I read that Egypt heretofore 
have temple of the riches frame on earth 
much like this goodly edifice of woman 
with alabaster pillar be those temple 
uphold and beautify and so be woman 
most curious glaze and so be woman 
cunning paint too and so be woman 
in outside wondrous heavenly so be woman 
but when a stranger view those phane within 
in stead of god and goddess he shall find 
a paint fowl a fury or a serpent 
and such celestial inner part have woman 

Rinaldo the poor fox that lose his tail 
persuade other also to lose they 
thyself for one perhaps that for desert 
or some defect in thy attempt refuse thou 
revile the whole sex beauty love and all 
I tell thou love be nature second son 
cause a spring of virtue where he shine 
and as without the sun the world great eye 
all colour beauty both of art and nature 
be give in vain to man so without love 
all beauty breed in woman be in vain 
all virtue bear in man lie bury 
for love inform they as the sun do colour 
and as the sun reflect his warm beam 
against the earth beget all fruit and flower 
so love fair shine in the inward man 
bring forth in he the honourable fruit 
of valour wit virtue and haughty thought 
brave resolution and divine discourse 
oh it be the paradise the heaven of earth 
and do thou know the comfort of two heart 
in one delicious harmony unite 
as to joy one joy and think both one thought 
live both one life and therein double life 
to see their soul meet at a interview 
in their bright eye at parley in their lip 
their language kiss and to observe the rest 
touch embrace and each circumstance 
of all love most unmatched ceremony 
thou will abhor thy tongue for blasphemy 
oh who can comprehend how sweet love taste 
but he that have be present at his feast 

be you in that vain too Valerio 
it be fit you shall be about your charge 
how blow and cart go forward I have know 
your joy be all employ in husbandry 
your study be how many load of hay 
a meadow of so many acre yield 
how many ox such a close will fat 
and be your rural service now convert 
from pan to Cupid and from beast to woman 
o if your father know this what a lecture 
of bitter castigation he will read you 

my father why my father do he think 
to rob i of myself I hope I know 
I be a gentleman though his covetous humour 
and education have transform i bailie 
and make i overseer of his pasture 
I will be myself in spite of husbandry 
and see bright heaven here come my husbandry 〈◊〉 eam 
here shall my cattle graze here nectar drink 
here will I hedge and ditch here hide my treasure 
oh poor Fortunio how will thou triumph 
if thou enjoy this happiness with my sister 

I be in heaven if once it be come to that 

and methinks it be my heaven that I be past it 
and shall the wretched machevilian 
the covetous knight your father see this sight 
lusty Valerio 

'sfoot sir if he shall 
he shall perceive ere long my skill extend 
to something more then sweaty husbandry 

I will bear thou witness thou can skill of dice 
card tennis wench dance and what not 
and this be something more than husbandry 
thou be know in ordinary and tobacco shop 
trust in tavern and in vault house 
and this be something more than husbandry 
yet all this while thy father apprehend thou 
for the most tame and thrifty groom in Europe 

well he have venture on a marriage 
will quite undo he do his father know it 

know it alas sir where can he bestow

but his inquisitive father will hear of it

and do your father understand so much 

that be the motion sir I be entreat 
your son to make to he because I know 
he be well speak and may much prevail 
in satisfy my father who much love he 
both for his wisdom and his husbandry 

indeed he be one can tell his tale I tell you 
and for his husbandry 

o sir have you hear 
what thrifty discipline he give my brother 
for make choice without my father knowledge 
and without riches you will have admire he 

nay nay I know he well but what be it 

that in the choice of wife man must respect 
the chief wife riches that in every course 
a man chief lodestar shall shine out of riches 
love nothing hearty in this world but riches 
cast off all friend all study all delight 
all honesty and religion for riches 
and many such which wisdom sure he learn 
of his experient father yet my brother 
so soothe his rash affection and presume 
so high on my father gentle nature 
that he be resolve to bring she home to he 
and like enough he will 

and like enough 
your silly father too will put it up 
a honest knight but much too much indulgent 
to his presume child 

what a difference 
do 〈◊〉 itself betwixt he and you 
have your son use you thus 

my son alas 
I hope to bring he up in other fashion 
follow my husbandry set early foot 
into the world he come not at the city 
nor know the city art 

but dice and wench 

acquaint himself with no delight but get 
a perfect pattern of sobriety 
temperance and husbandry to all my household 
and what be his company I pray not wench 

wench I 〈◊〉 be swear he never smell a wench breath 
yet but methinks it be fit you seek he out a wife 

a wife Rinaldo 
he dare not look a woman in the face 

'sfoot hold he to one your son such a sheep 

it be strange in earnest 

well sir though for my thriftless brother sake 
I little care how my wrong 〈◊〉 take it 
yet for my father quiet if yourself 
will join hand with your wife and towards son 
I shall deserve it some way 

good Rinaldo 
I love you and your father but this matter 
be not for i to deal in and it be needless 
you say your brother be resolve presume 
your father will allow it 

see my father since you be resolute not to move he sir 
in any case conceal the secret absconditse 
by way of a atonement let i pray you will 

upon my honour 

thank sir 

God save thou honourable knight Gostanzo 

friend Marc Antonio welcome and I think 
I have good news to welcome you withal 

he can hold 

what news I pray you sir 

you have a forward valiant elder son 
but wherein be his forwardness and valour 

I know not where in you intend he so 

Forward before valiant behind his duty 
that he have dare before your due consent 
to take a wife 

a wife sir what be she 

one that be rich enough her hair pure amber 
her forehead mother of pearl her fair eye 
two wealthy diamond her lip mine of ruby 
her tooth be orient pearl her neck pure ivory 

jest not good sir in a affair so serious 
I love my son and if his youth reward i 
with his contempt of my consent in marriage 
it be to be fear that his presumption build not 
of his good choice that will bear out itself 
and be bad the news be worse than bad 

what call you bad be it bad to be poor 

the world account it so but if my son 
have in her birth and virtue hold his choice 
without disparagement the salt be less 

sit the wind there blow there so calm a gale 
from a contemn and deserve anger 
be you so easy to be disobey 

what shall I do if my enamour son 
have be so forward I assure myself 
he do it more to satisfy his love 
than to incense my hate or to neglect i 

a pass kind construction suffer this 
you open he door to any villainy 
he will dare to sell to pawn run ever riot 
despise your love in all and laugh at you 
and that knight competency you have get 
with care and labour he with lust and idleness 
will bring into the stipend of a beggar 
all to maintain a wanton whirligig 
worth nothing more than she bring on her back 
yet all your wealth too little for that back 
by heaven I pity your decline state 
for be assure your son have set his foot 
in the right pathway to consumption 
up to the heart in love and for that love 
nothing can be too dear his love desire 
and how insatiate and unlimited 
be the ambition and the beggarly pride 
of a dame hoist from a beggar state 
to a state competent and plentiful 
you can be so simple not to know 

I must confess the mischief but alas 
where be in i the power of remedy 

where in your just displeasure cast he off 
receive he not let he endure the use 
of their inforce kindness that must trust he 
for meat and money for apparel house 
and every thing belong to that estate 
which he must learn with want of misery 
since pleasure and a full estate have blind 
his dissolute desire 

what shall I do 
if I shall banish he my house and sight 
what desperate resolution may it breed 
to run into the war and there to live 
in want of competency and perhaps 
taste the unrecoverable loss of his chief limb 
which while he have in peace at home with i 
may with his spirit ransom his estate 
from any loss his marriage can procure 

be it true ne let he run into the war 
and lose what limb he can better one branch 
be lop away than all the whole tree shall perish 
and for his want better young want then old 
you have a young son at Padua 
I like his learning well make he your heir 
and let your other walk let he buy wit 
at his own charge not at his father if you lose he 
you lose no more than that be lose before 
if you recover he you find a son 

I can part with he 

if it be so and that your love to he be so extreme 
in needful danger ever choose the least 
if he shall be in mind to pass the sea 
your son Rinaldo who tell i all this 
will tell i that and so we shall prevent it 
if by no stern course you will venture that 
let he come home to i with his fair wife 
and if you chance to see he shake he up 
as if your wrath be hard to be reflect 
that he may fear hereafter to offend 
in other dissolute course at my house 
with my advice and my son good example 
who shall serve as a glass for he to see 
his fault and mend they to his precedent 
I make no doubt but of a dissolute son 
and disobedient to send he home 
both dutiful and thrifty 

o Gostanzo 
can you do this you shall preserve yourself 
a perfect friend of i and i a son 

Remember you your part and fear not i 
rate he revile he and renounce he too 
speak can you do it man 

I will do all I can 

alas good man how nature overweigh he 

God save you sir 

Rinaldo all the news 
you tell i as a secret I perceive 
be pass common for your father know it 
the first thing he relate be the marriage 

And be extreme move 

beyond all measure 
but I do all I can to quench his fury 
tell he how easy it be for a young man 
to run that amorous course and though his choice 
be nothing rich yet she be gentle bear 
well qualify and beautiful but he still 
be quite relentless and will needs renounce he 

my brother know it well and be resolve 
to trail a pike in field rather than bide 
the more fear push of my vex father fury 

Indeed that be one way but be no more mean 
leave to his fine wit then to incense his father 
with a more violent rage and to redeem 
a great offence with great 

so I tell he 
but to a desperate mind all breath be lose 

go to let he be wise and use his friend 
among who I will be foremost to his father 
without this desperate error he intend 
join to the other I will not doubt to make his 
Easie return into his father favour 
so he submit himself as duty bind he 
for father will be know to be themselves 
and often when their anger be not deep 
will paint a outward rage upon their look 

all this I tell he sir but what say he 
I know my father will not be reclaim 
he will think that if he wink at this offence 
it will open door to any villainy 
I will dare to sell to pawn and run all riot 
to laugh at all his patience and consume 
all he have purchase to a honour purpose 
in maintenance of a wanton whirligig 
worth nothing more than she wear on her back 

the very word I use to incense his father 
but good Rinaldo let he be advise 
how will his father grieve shall he be maim 
or quite miscarry in the ruthless war 

I tell he so but better far say he 
one branch shall utter be lop away 
than the whole tree of all his race shall perish 
and for his want better young want than eld 

by heaven the same word still I use to his father 
why come this about well good Rinaldo 
if he dare not endure his father look 
let he and his fair wife come home to i 
till I have qualify his father passion 
he shall be kind welcome and be sure 
of all the intercession I can use 

I thank you sir I will try what I can do 
although I fear I I shall strive in vain 

well try he try he 

thank sir so I will 
see this old politic dissemble knight 
now he perceive my father so affectionate 
and that my brother may hereafter live 
by he and he with equal use of either 
he will put on a face of hollow friendship 
but this will prove a excellent ground to sow 
the seed of mirth among we 〈◊〉 go seek 
Valerio and my brother and tell they 
such news of their affair as they will admire 

how happy be your fortune above i 
both still be wood and court still so feed 
on the delight of love that still you find 
a appetite to more where I be cloy 
and be bind to love sport care not for they

there be no man eye fix on i but do pierce 
my husband soul if any take my welfare 
he straight doubt treason practise to his bed 
fancy but to himself all likelihood 
of my wrong to he and lay all on i 
for certain truth yet seek he with his best 
to put disguise on all his jealousy

which otherwise I shall not dream upon 
yet live he still abroad at great expense 
turn mere gallant from his farmer state

run race with the 〈◊〉 of the court 
feast they at home and entertain they costly 
and then upbraid i with their company

in deed such love be like a smoky fire 
in a cold morning though the fire be cheerful

and dote indulgence show to he still 
that thus have teach your son to be no son

of your whole house in kind regard whereof 
I have advise you for your credit sake 
and for the tender welfare of your son 
to frown on he a little if you do not 
but at first parley take he to your favour 
I protest utter to renounce all care 
of you and you and all your amity 
they say he be wretched that out of himself 
can draw counsel to his proper weal 
but he be thrice wretched that have neither counsel 
within himself nor apprehension 
of counsel for his own good from another 

well I will arm myself against this weakness 
the best I can I long to see this Helen 
that have enchant my young Paris thus 
and his like to set all our poor trope on fire 

here come my son withdraw take up your stand 
you shall hear odds betwixt your son and I 

tell he I can not do it shall I be make 
a foolish novice my purse set a broach 
by every cheat come you seven to lend 
my money and be laugh at tell he plain 
I profess husbandry and will not play 
the prodigal like he against my profession 

here be a son 

a admirable spark

'sfoot let he lead 
a better husband life and live not idle 
spend his time his coin and self on wench

from this and that brave gallant and such gallant 
as I protest I see but through a grate 

and what be this message

of payment and disfurnish of mean present 
if I will do he the kind office therefore 
to trust he but some sevennight with the keep 
of forty crown for I he deep swear 
as he be a gentleman to discharge his trust 
and that I shall eternal endear he 
to my wish service he protest and contest

to be deceive by breath I will turn thou lose 
to the most cunning cheater of they all 

'sfoot he be not ashamed beside to charge i 
with a late promise I must yield in deed 
I do to shift he with some contentment 
make such a frivall promise 

ay well do 
promise be no fetter with that tongue 
thy promise past unpromise it again 
wherefore have man a tongue of power to speak 
but to speak still to his own private purpose 
beast utter but one sound but man have change 
of speech and reason even by nature give they 
now to say one thing and another now 
as best may serve their profitable end 

by’r lady sound instruction to a son 

nay sir he make his claim by debt of friendship 

tush friendship be but a term boy the fond world 
like to a dote mother glaze over 
her child imperfection with fine term 
what she call friendship and true humane kindness

respect but mere rusticity and clownery 

better and better

will take so ill so sleight a fault as this 

call you it sleight nay though his spirit take it 
in high manner than for your love sake 
I will have wish he yet I make a doubt 
have my son do the like if my affection 
will not have turn to more spleen than your father 
and yet I qualify he all I can 
and doubt not but that time and my persuasion 
will work out your excuse since youth and love 
be the unresisted organy to seduce you 
but you must give he leave for father must 
be win by penitence and submission 
and not by force or opposition 

alas sir what advise you i to do 
I know my father to be high move 
and be not able to endure the breath 
of his express displeasure who hot flame 
I think my absence soon will have quench

to come a little soon that you may 
have see a handsome sight but let that pass 
the short be that your sister Gratiana 
shall stay no long here

Repent you then so soon your favour to she 
and to my brother 

not so good Rinaldo

into a place whereto your sister enter

my house a kind receipt for your kind brother

than she have cause to like of 

what be the matter

well sir such compliment perhaps may cost 
marry Fortunio the set on 
nor can I keep my knowledge he that late 
before my face I can not get to look 
upon your sister by this light now kiss she

that my opinion of he be the same 
that it be ever it will be a mean 
to bridle this fresh humour breed in he 

let i then school he foot I will rattle he up

Is to remove the cause carry the object 
from his late tempt eye 

Alas sir whither 
you know my father be incense so much

place she with some friend 
but for a time till I reclaim your father

with the fine slight and policy of the world 
as I myself be 

I will go fetch she straight 
and this jest thrive it will make we princely sport 
but you must keep our counsel second all 
which to make likely you must needs sometime 
give your son leave as if you know it not 
to steal and see she at my father house

if you shall not restrain he by good counsel 

I will have a eye on he I warrant thou 
I will in and warn the gentlewoman to make ready

heaven heaven I see these politician 
out of blind fortune hand be our most fool 
it be she that give the lustre to their wit 
still plod at traditional device 
but take they out of they to present action 
a man may grope and tickle they like a trout 
and take they from their close dear hole as fat 
as a physician and as giddyheaded 
as if be miracle heaven have take from they 
even that which common belong to fool 
well now let we note what black ball of debate 
Valerio wit have cast betwixt Cornelio 
and the enamour courtier I believe 
his wife and he will part he jealousy 
have ever watch occasion of divorce 
and now Valerio villainy will present it 
see here come the twincourtier his companion 

Rinaldo well encounter 

why what news 

most sudden and infortunate Rinaldo 
Cornelio be incense so against his wife 
that no man can procure her quiet with he 
I have assay he and make Marc Antonio 
with all his gentle rhetoric second i 
yet all I fear i will be cast away 
see see they come join thy wit good Rinaldo 
and help to pacify his yellow fury 

with all my heart I consecrate my wit 
to the wish comfort of distress lady 

will any man assure i of her good behaviour 

who can assure a jealous spirit you may be afraid of the shadow of your ear and imagine they to be horn if you will assure yourself appoint keeper to watch she 

and who shall watch the keeper 

to be sure of that be you her keeper 

Well say and share the horn yourself 
for that be the keeper fee 

but say I be go out of town and must trust other how shall I know if those I trust be trusty to i 

marry sir by a singular instinct give natural to all you marry man that if your wife play legerdeheel though you be a hundred mile off yet you shall be sure instant to find it in your forehead 

sound doctrine I warrant you I be resolve i'faith 

then give i leave to speak sir that have all this while be silent I have hear you with extreme patience now therefore prick up your 〈◊〉 and vouchsafe i audience 

good boy a i honour 

pray what be you sir 

I be here for default of better of counsel with the fair Gazetta and though herself have be best able to defend herself if she have be here and will have please to put forth the buckler which nature have give all woman I mean her tongue 

excellent good boy 

yet since she either vouchsafe it not or think her innocence a sufficient shield against your jealous accusation I will presume to undertake the defence of that absent and honourable lady who swear knight I be and 〈◊〉 she of all that name for lady be grow a common name to their whole sex which sex I have ever love from my youth and shall never cease to love till I want wit to admire 

a excellent speak boy 

give ear Cornelio here be a young 〈◊〉 send to persuade thou 

well sir let he say on 

it be a heavy case to see how this light sex be tumble and toss from post to pillar under the unsavory breath of every humourous peasant Gazetta you say be unchaste disloyal and I wot not what alas be it her fault be she not a woman do she not suck it as other of her sex do from her mother breast and will you condemn that as her fault which be her nature Alas sir you must consider a woman be a unfinished creature deliver hasty to the world before nature have set to that 〈◊〉 which shall have make they perfect fault they have no doubt but be we free turn your eye into yourself good signior Cornelio and weigh your own imperfection with she if she be wanton abroad be not you want at home if she be 〈◊〉 be not you 〈◊〉 if she be high set be not you take down if she be a courtesan be not you a cuckold 

out you rogue 

on with thy speech boy 

you do not well Cornelio to discourage the bashful youth 

Forth boy I warrant thou 

but if our own imperfection will not teach we to bear with they yet let their virtue persuade we let we endure their bad quality for their good allow the prickle for the rose the brack for the velvet the pare for the cheese and so forth if you say they range abroad consider it be nothing but to avoid idleness at home their nature be still to be do keep they a do at home let they practise one good quality or other either sow sing play chide dance or so and these will put such idle toy out of their head into you but if you can find they variety of business within door yet at least imitate the ancient wise citizen of this city who use careful to provide their wife garden near the town to plant to graft in as occasion serve only to keep they from idleness 

everlasting good boy 

I 〈◊〉 your knavery sir and will yet have patience 

Forth my brave Curio 

as to her unquietness which some have rude term shrewishness though the fault be in she yet the cause be in you what so calm as the sea of it own nature art be never able to equal it your dice table nor your bowl alley be not comparable to it yet if a blast of wind do but cross it not so turbulent and violent a element in the world so nature in lieu of woman scarcity of wit have endue they with a large portion of will if they may without impeach enjoy their will no quiet creature under heaven but if the breath of their husband mouth once across their will nothing more tempestuous why then sir shall you husband across your wife will thus consider the law allow they not will at all at their death because it intend they shall have their will while they live 

answer he but that Cornelio 

all shall not serve she turn I be think of other matter 

thou have half win he wag ply he yet a little further 

now sir for these cuckooish song of you of cuckold horn graft and such like what be they but mere imaginary toy breed out of your own head as your own and so by tradition deliver from man to man like scarecrow to terrify fool from this earthly paradise of wedlock coin at first by some spend poet superannuated bachelor or some that be scarce man of their hand who like the fox have lose his tail will persuade other to lose they for company again for your cuckold what be it but a mere fiction show i any such creature in nature if there be I can never see it neither can I ever find any sensible difference betwixt a cuckold and a christian creature to conclude let poet coin or fool credit what they list for my own part I be clear of this opinion that your cuckold be a mere chimera and that there be no cuckold in the world but those that have wife and so I will leave they 

it be excellent good sir I do take you sir do you see to be as it be bastard to the saucy courtier that will have i father more of your fraternity do you see and so be instruct as we hear to second that villain with your tongue which he have act with his tenure piece do you see 

no such matter a my credit sir 

well sir be as be may I scorn to set my head against you do you see when in the mean time I will firk your father whether you see or no 

God my life Cornelio 

have at your father i'faith boy if he can find he 

see he come here he have miss he 

how now my heart what not a wench among you 
it be a sign you be not in the grace of wench 
that they will let you be thus long alone 

well Dariotto glory not too much 
that for thy brisk attire and lip perfume 
thou play play the stally on ever where thou come 
and like the husband of the flock run through 
the whole town hear and no man bed secure 
no woman honour unattempted by thou 
think not to be thus fortunate for ever 
but in thy amorous conquest at the last 
some wound will slice your mazer Mars himself 
fall into 〈◊〉 snare and so may you 

Alas alas faith I have but the name 
I love to court and win and the consent 
without the act obtain be all I seek 
I love the victory that draw no blood 

o it be a high desert in any man 
to be a secret lecher I know some 
that like thyself be true in nothing else 

And methinks it be nothing if not tell 
at least the joy be never full before 

well Dariotto thou have as good confess 
the sun shine broad upon your practise 
Vulcan will wake and intercept you one day 

why the more jealous knave and coxcomb he 
what shall the shake of his bed a little 
put he in motion it become he not 
let he be dull and stall and then be quiet 
the way to draw my custom to his house 
be to be mad and jealous it be the sauce 
that whet my appetite 

or any 〈◊〉 
sine periculo 〈◊〉 lusus 
they that be jealous use it still of purpose 
to draw you to their house

I be of that opinion who will steal 
out of a common orchard let i gain 
my love with labour and enjoy it with fear 
or I be go 

what Dariotto here 
foot dare thou come near Cornelio house 

why be the bull run mad what ail he trow 

I know not what he ail but I will wish you 
to keep out of the reach of his sharp horn 
for by this hand he will gore you 

and why i 
more than thyself or these two other whelp 
you all have baste he as well as I 
I wonder what be the cause 

nay that he know 
and swear withal that wheresoever he meet you 
he will mark you for a marker of man wine 

pray heaven he be not jealous by some tale 
that have be tell he late do you never 
attempt his wife have no love harbinger 
no look no letter pass betwixt you and she 

for look I can answer I bestow they 
at large and careless much like the sun 
if any be so foolish to apply they 
to any private fancy of their own 
as many do it be not my fault thou know 

well Dariotto this set face of thou 
if thou be guilty of offence to he 
come out of very want of wit and feeling 
what danger haunt thou for Cornelio 
〈◊〉 a tall man I tell you and it be best

his patience or his pardon for past doubt 
thou die if he but see thou

as certain for all these sly disguise 
time will strip truth into her nakedness 
thou have good plea against he to confess 
the honour action and to claim his pardon 

it be true for all be do he deep swear 
out of his heart 

he have much faith the while 
that swear a thing so quite against his heart 

why this be policy 

well see you repair 
to Gratiana daily and enjoy she 
in her true kind and now we must expect 
the resolute and ridiculous divorce 
Cornelio have sue against his wedlock

why if I have be so mind as you think I can have fling his patofle down the stair or do he some other disgrace but I wink at it and draw on the good fool more and more only to bring he within my compass 

why this be policy in grain 

and now shall the world see I be as wise as my father 

be it come to this then will I make a speech in praise of this reconcilement include therein the praise and honour of the most fashionable and authentical horn stand close gentle and be silent 

come on let we hear his wit in this potable humour 

the course of the world like the life of man be say to be divide into several age as we into infancy childhood youth and so forward to oldage so the world into the golden age the silver the brass the iron the leaden the wooden and now into this present age which we term the horned age not that but former age have injoyde this benefit as well as our time but that in we it be more common and nevertheless precious it be say that in the golden age of the world the use of gold be not then know a argument of the simplicity of that age lest therefore succeed age shall hereafter impute the same fault to we which we lay upon the first age that we live in the horn age of the world shall not understand the use the virtue the honour and the very royalty of the horn I will in brief sound the praise thereof that they who be already in possession of it may bear their head aloft as be proud of such lofty accoutrement and they that be but in possibility may be ravish with a desire to be in possession 
a trophy so honourable and unmatchable powerful that it be able to raise any man from a beggar to a emperor fellow a duke fellow a nobleman fellow alderman fellow so glorious that it deserve to be wear by most opinion in the most conspicuous place about a man for what worthy crest can you bear then the horn which if it may be see with our mortal eye what a wonderful spectacle will there be and how high they will ravish the beholder but their substance be incorporal not fall under sense nor mix of the gross concretion of element but a quintessence beyond they a spiritual essence invisible and everlasting 
and this have be the cause that many man have call their be in question whether there be such a thing in verum nacura or not because they be not to be see as though nothing be that be not to be see whoever see the wind yet what wonderful effect be see of it it drive the cloud yet no man see it it rock the house bear down tree castle steeple yet who see it in like sort do your horn it swell the forehead yet none see it it rock the cradle yet none see it so that you plain perceive sense be no judge of essence the moon to any man sense seem to be horn yet who know not the moon to be ever perfect round so likewise your head seem ever to be round when in deed they be oftentimes horn for their original it be unsearchable natural they be not for there be beast bear with horn more than with tooth create they be not for ex nihilo nihil sit then will you ask i how come they into the world I know not but I be sure woman bring they into this part of the world howsoever some doctor be of opinion that they come in with the devil and not unlike for as the devil bring sin into the world but the woman bring it to the man so it may very well be that the devil bring horn into the world but the woman bring they to the man 
for their power it be general over the world no nation so barbarous no country so proud but do equal homage to the horn Europa when she be carry through the sea by the saturnian bull be say for fear of fall to have hold by the horn and what be this but a plain show to we that all Europa which take name from that Europa shall likewise hold by the horn so that I say it be universal over the face of the world general over the face of Europe and common over the face of this country what city what town what village what street nay what house can quit itself of this prerogative I have read that the lion once make a proclamation through all the forest that all horn beast shall depart forthwith upon pain of death if this proclamation shall be make through our forest lord what press what run what fly will there be even from all the part of it he that have but a bunch of flesh in his head will away and some foolish fearful will imagine the shadow of his ear to be horn alas how desert will this forest be leave 
to conclude for there force it be irrefutable for be they not inevitable then may either properness of person secure a man or wisdom prevent be or greatness exempt or riches redeem they but present experience have teach we that in this case all these stand in no stead for we see the proper man take part of they the best wit can avoid they for then shall poet be no cuckold nor can money redeem they for then will richman fine for their horn as they do for office but this be hold for a maxim that there be more rich cuckold then poor last for continuance of the horn it be undeterminable till death neither do they determine with the wife death howsoever ignorant writer hold opinion they do for as when a knight die his lady still retain the title of lady when a company be cast yet the captain still retain the title of captain so though the wife die by who this title come to her husband yet by the courtesy of the city he shall be a cuckold during life let all ignorant ass prate what they list 

notable wag come sir shake hand with he 
in who high honour you have make this speech 

and you sir come join hand you be one among they 

very well do now take your several wife 
and spread like wildgoose though you now grow tame 
live merry together and agree 
horn can be keep off with jealousy
