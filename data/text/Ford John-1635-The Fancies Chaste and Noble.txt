betwixt the abject lowness of a poverty

to plenty which now buy it

what ail thou man be merry hang up jealousies 

who ay I jealous no no here be no cause 
in this place it be a nunnery a retirement 
for meditation all the difference extant 
but puzzle only bar belief not ground it 
rich service in place soft and fair lodging 
variety of recreation exercise 
of music in all change neat attendance 
princely nay royal furniture of garment 
satiety of garden orchard water work 
picture so ravish that range eye 
may dwell upon a dotage of conceit 
without a single wish for lively substance 
the great world in a little world of fancy 
be here abstract no temptation proffer 
but such as fool and mad folk can invite to 
and yet 

and yet your reason can answer 
the objection of your fear which argue danger 

danger dishonour Troylo be my sister 
in safety from those charm I must confess 
I can live here for ever 

but you can not 
I can assure you for it be then scarce possible 
a door may open to thou hardly a loophole 

my presence then be usher to her ruin 
and loss of she the fruit of my preferment

to lodge it in the inmost of thy bosom 
where memory may not find it for discovery 
by our firm truth of friendship I require thou

in nature first that impotence since second 
and render more infirm by a fatal breach 
receive in fight against the turkish galley 
be make uncapable of any faculty 
of active manhood more than what affection 
proper unto his sex must else distinguish 
so that no help of art can warrant life 
shall he transcend the bound his weakness limit 

on I attend with eagerness 

it be strange 
such natural defect at no time check 
a full and free sufficiency of spirit 
which flow both in so clear and fix a strength 
that to confirm belief it seem where nature 
be in the body lame she be supply 
in fine proportion of the mind a word 
conclude all to a man his enemy 
he be a dangerous threaten but to woman 
however pleasurable no way cunning 
to show ability of friendship other 
than what his outward sense can delight in 
or charge and bounty court with 

good good Troylo 
o that I have a lusty faith to credit it 
though none of all this wonder shall be possible 

as I love honour and a honest name 
I falter not my Livio in one syllable 

news admirable it be it be so pish I know it 
yet he have a kind heart of his own to girl 
young handsome girl yes yes so he may 
it be grant he will now and then be piddle 
and play the wanton like a fly that dally 
about a candle flame then scorch his wing 
drop down and creep away ha 

Hardly that too 
to look upon fresh beauty to discourse 
in a unblushing merriment of word 
to hear they play or sing and see they dance 
to pass the time in pretty amorous question 
read a chaste verse of love or prattle riddle 
be the height of his temptation

our soul must live in 

so belike the marquess 
store some new grace some special close employment 
for who your kind commend by deputation 
please think on to oblige and Livio charity 
descend on Romanello liberal above my mean to thank 

Sienna sometime 
have be inform how glad there do pass 
a treaty of chaste love with Castamela 
from this good heart it be in i a error 
wilful and causeless it be confess that hinder 
such honourable prosecution 
even and equal better thought consider 
how much I wrong the gentle course which lead you 
to vow of true affection we of friendship 

sit the wind there boy leave formal circumstance proceed you dally yet 

then without plea 
for countenance what have be injurious 
on my part I be come to tender real 
my sister a love wife to you free take her 
right honest man and as you live together 
may your increase of year prove but one spring 
one last flourish youth she be your own 
my hand shall perfect what be require to ceremony 

brother this day be mean a holiday 
for feast on every side 

the newturned courtier 
proffer most frank but withal leave out 
a due consideration of the narrowness 
our short estate be bound in some politic 
as they rise up like Livio to perfection 
in their own competency gather also 
grave supplement of providence and wisdom 
yet he abate in he you use a triumph 
in your advantage it smell of state 
we know you be no fool 

sooth I believe he 

else it be imposture 

folly rank and sense less 

enjoin a oath at large 

since you mean earnest 
receive in satisfaction I be resolve 
for single life there be a time be Livio 
when indiscretion blind forecast in i 
but recollection with your rule of thriftiness 
prevail against all passion 

you will be court 
courtship be the child of coyness Romanello 
and for the rule it be possible to name they 

a single life be not burden but to draw 
in yoke be chargeable and do require 
a double maintenance Livio very word 
for he can live without a wife and purchase 
by our lady so you do sir send you joy on it 
these rule you see be possible and answer 

full answer be late mate to this already 
my sister be only thou 

where live the creature 
your pity stoop to pin upon your servant 
not in a nunnery for a year probation 
fie on such coldness there be bowrds of fancy 
ravish from troop of fairy nymph and virgin 
cull from the downy breast of queen their mother 
in the titanian empire far from mortal 
but these be tale troth I have quite abandon 
all love humour 

here be scorn in riddle 

be there another marquess in Sienna 
more potent than the same who be vicegerent 
to the great duke of Florence our grand master 
be the great duke himself here and will lift up 
my head to fellow pomp among his noble 
by falsehood to the honour of a sister 
urge i instrument in his seraglio 
I will tear the wardrobe of a outside from he 
rather than live a pandar to his bribery 

so will the he you talk to Romanello 
without a noise that be singular 

she be a countess 
Flavia she but she have a earl her husband 
though far from our procurement 

Castamela 
be refuse then 

never design my choice 
you know and I know Livio more I tell thou 
a noble honesty ought to give allowance 
when reason intercede by all that be manly 
I range not in derision but compassion 

intelligence fly swift 

pretty swift 
we have compare the copy with the original 
and find no disagreement 

so my sister 
can be no wife for Romanello 

no no 
one no once more and ever this your courtesy 
foil i a second sir you bring a welcome 
you must not part without it scan with pity 
my plainness I intend nor gall nor quarrel 

far be it from i to press a blame great lady

present a civil part Romanello 
by the next footpost thou will hear some news 
of alteration if I send come to i

no more of these complaint and clamour 
have we nor enemy abroad 
nor wake sycophant

by which they watch to lay advantage open 
to vulgar descant but among ourselves 
some who we call our own must practise scandal 
out of a liberty of ease and fullness 
against our honour we shall quick order 
strange reformation sir and you will find it 

when servant servant slave once relish licence 
of good opinion from a noble nature 
they take upon they boldness to abuse 
such interest and lord it over their fellow 
as if they be exempt from that condition 

he be unfit to manage public matter 
who know not how to rule at home his household 
you must be jealous puppy of a boy too 
raise uproar bandy noise among young maiden 
keep revel in your madness use authority 
of give punishment a fool must fool you 
and this be all but pastime as you think it
