shame and dishonour to the roman name 
a triumph hold at Alexandria 
only to honour Cleopatra pride 

ah Marcus this egyptian queen be make 
to be the ruin of Antonius 

to be the pleasure of Antonius 

how can you jest Canidius on a theme 
so sad 

how Plancus can you prophecy 
so sad on so merry a occasion 
as be the love of lady 

let Canidius 
have his own way Munatius it be in vain 
to talk to he 

will you can let i have 
Antonius his way upon condition 
I suffer you to censure grave of it 
and prophesy my ruin but my lord 
you be as good be merry too and take 
your share of pleasure in the aegyptian court 
you will do no good with these persuasion 
he love the queen and will do so in spite 
of our morality 

it be too too true 
that face of she that beauty in the bud 
not full blow in year of innocence 
if any year of she be innocent 
set off with no adulterism of art 
nor clothe with state and pompous majesty 
but in a fortune cloud and distress 
a wretched prisoner in her brother court 
yet then I say that charm face can move 
the manly temper of wise Julius Caesar 
that mar in heat of all his active war 
when he pursue the fly Pompey hither 
his sword yet reek in Pharsalus slaughter 
at sight of she become a dote lover 
and can we think that our Antonius 
a man not master of that temperance 
that Caesar have can find a strength to guard 
his soul against that beauty now set off 
with so much wealth and majesty 

no sure 
I do not think Antonius be a eunuch 
nor can I have believe he have be worthy 
to be a successor in Caesar power 
unless he have succeed he in she 
great Julius noble act in war and state 
assure the world that he be wise and valiant 
but if he have not fall in love with she 
I shall have much suspect his good nature 

nay then Canidius it shall be you 

or what indeed be greatness in the world 
if he that do possess it may not play 
the wanton with it this egyptian queen 
be a state beauty and ordain by fate 
to be possess by they that rule the world 
great Pompey son enjoy her first and pluck 
her virgin blossom when that family Plutarch 
who ruin fill the world be overthrow 
great Julius next come in as conqueror 
to have his share and as he do in power 
succeed he in Cleopatra love 
now our Antonius take his turn and think 
that all the legion all the sword that come 
to make his greatness up when Julius die 
can give no great privilege to he 
then power to be the servant to this queen 
thus whosoever in Rome be conqueror 
his laurel wreath be Cleopatra love 
and to speak just of she nature teem 
to build this woman for no mean height 
her soul be full of greatness and her wit 
have charm as many as her beauty have 
with majesty beyond her sex she rule 
her spacious kingdom and all neighbour prince 
admire her part how many language 
speak she with elegance ambassador 
from the aethiopian Arab troglodyte Plut 
from the hebrew syrian Mede and parthian 
have in amazement hear this learned queen 
without the aid of a interpreter 
in all their several tongue return their answer 
when most of her dull predecessor king 
since Ptolemaeus Philadelphus time 
scarce understand the egyptian tongue and some 
have quite forget the macedonian 

how well Canidius descant on this theme 

I will lay my life it please he the man 
be deep in love and pity it be he have 
so great a rival as Antonius 

well use your wit upon i but I doubt 
if any man can search your secret thought 
it be envy not morality that make 
you tax his love how grave ere you talk 

but can Canidius think it shall be just 
in our Antonius to forsake for she 
his lawful wife the good Octavia 

then like a Roman let i answer Marcus 
be it become a care worthy of we 
what woman Antony enjoy have we 
time to dispute his matrimonial fault 
that have already see the breach of all 
Rome sacred law by which the world be bind 
have we endure our consul state and power 
to be subject by the lawless arm 
of private man or senator proscribe 
and can we now consider whether they 
that do all this may keep a wench or no 
it be the crime of we and fate itself 
that Antony and Caesar can usurp 
a power so great beyond which we can suffer 
no more worth think of nor be it to we 
any great fortune if Antonius 
be honest of his body 

have we then 
who have be great magistrate quite lose 
all show of liberty and now not dare 
to counsel he 

a show of liberty 
when we have lose the substance be best keep 
by seem not to understand those fault 
which we want power to mend for my own part 
I love the person of Antonius 
and through his great looseness can discern 
a nature here honest than Caesar 
and if a war do grow betwixt they as sure 
ambition will ere long find out a cause 
although Octavia have not be neglect 
rather than Rome shall still obey two lord 
can wish that all be Anthony alone 
who will I think be bring more easy 
than Caesar to resign the government 

will I can think that either will do so 
here come her servant Mardio enter Mardio 

noble lord 
the queen by i entreat your company 
at supper with the lord Antonius 

Mardio return our humble service 
we will instant attend she now my friend 
can you a while put off austerity 
and rigid censure to be free merry 

it may be so we will try what wine can do exeunt 

Glaucus let more of this perfume be get 

I have enough in readiness or else 
it will be too late to think on it now the queen 
be upon entrance 

Charmio be thou sure 
those taper stand just as the queen command 

it be the same order that Antonius 
when last he feast here so much admire 
and say amongst all the curiosity Plutarch 
that he have see the place of those light 
do not the least affect he 

though the roman 
in power and warlike state exceed we far 
yet in our court of Egypt they may learn 
pleasure and bravery but be thou sure 
that all thing here be well 

as exquisite 
as the queen wish will have it hark they come 

to say my lord that you be welcome hither 
be to disparage you who have the power 
to make yourself so whatever you see 
in Egypt be your own 

what Egypt hold 
if I be judge not all the world beside 
can equalise 

will it please you take 
your place and these your noble roman friend 

father Achoreus sit you near to i 
your holy order and great age which show 
the god have love you well may just challenge 
a reverence from we 

great Julius Caesar 
do love my father well he oft be please 
at hour of leisure to confer with he 
about the nature of our Nile of all 
the mystery of religion and the wonder 
that Egypt breed 

he have a know soul 
and be a master of philosophy 
as well as war 

how like the spangle sky 
these taper make the higharched roof to show 
while Cleopatra like bright Cynthia 
in her full orb more guild the cheerful night 
she be still at full yet still methinks she vex 
and grow more fair and more majestical 

my lord you roman who victorious arm 
have make you master of the world possess 
such full and high delight in Italy 
that our poor Egypt can present no pleasure 
worth your acceptance but let i entreat 
you will be free merry and forgive 
your entertainment 

it be a entertainment 
that may invite and please the god methinks 
Jove shall descend while Cleopatra here 
disguise for love as once for fear he be 
when bold Typheous scale the starry sky 
and all the god disguise in Egypt lurk 
love be a noble cause than fear to bring he 
and such a love as thou 

if I can think 
that ere great Jove do play such feat as those 
I will now believe that he be here disguise 
and take the noble shape of Anthony 

this compliment so far transcend it leave 
no answer for a wit so dull as i 
not he that know how to acquire 
but to enjoy be bless 
nor do our happiness consist 
in motion but in rest 
the god pass man in bliss because 
they toil not for more height 
but can enjoy and in their own 
eternal rest delight 
then prince do not toil nor care 
enjoy what you possess 
which while you do you equalise 
the god in happiness 

Minutius Plancus I be think now 
how Hannibal be charm at Capua 
when that delicious place have mollify 
his rough and cruel soul and make he learn 
the lesson of soft love and luxury 

there be no cause Marcus for such a thought 
for our Antonius in the heat of all 
his active life know how to revel well 

let this soft music cease and loud sound 
this second course be i call in Lucilius 
fair Cleopatra for addition Plutarch 
to what thou hold the worldcommand Rome 
present these crown and by my hand invest 
thou Cleopatra queen of wealthy Cyprus 
of Coelosyria and Phoenicia 
blush not my love nor let Rome bounty force 
thy modesty these crown from thy fair brow 
receive more lustre than they can bestow 

I think he need not great fear she blush 

no Marcus no alas these petty kingdom 
though too too great to be so ill bestow 
be not the scope of her ambitious aim 

my lord I dare not make excuse or plead 
unworthiness where once Antonius wisdom 
have make election to confer his favour 

Admire not friend the godlike power of Rome 
be more declare by what it give away Plutarch 
then what it hold but these be still our own 
and Cleopatra Rome deserve friend 

I can choose but think how fit a state 
for Cleopatra Cyprus kingdom be 
and shall believe that it be ominous 
that noble Julius Caesar after all 
those four rich triumph which he hold at Rome 
when he resolve with like magnificence 
to build a temple to the goddess Venus 
from who his house derive their pedigree 
within his stately temple to express 
the image of that goddess he set up 
fair Cleopatra figure in the place 
suppose she to be the queen of love 
you know my lord Antonius this be true 
and Cyprus ever be fair Venus I will 

it be well observe noble Canidius 

fill i some wine health to the cyprian queen 

drink it to i Canidius and I thank thou 
let it go round my friend 

I ever think 
myself much bind to brave Canidius 
since I be happy in his company 

how fit it be no other cyprian queen 
but Cleopatra shall the poet know 
who fancy now shall raise that kingdom high 
more amorous now will Paphos mountain show 
and all those flowery mead the field of love 
over which no wind but western ever blow 
the air itself will yield a sweet breath 
while Cleopatra reign the cyprian queen 

how amorous in his language he be grow 

the time I fear Minutius will require 
a rough language short we shall hear 
assoon as any news can come from Rome 

but long ago be I enforce to know 
that Cleopatra be the queen of love 
when first I meet thou in Cilicia plut 
and down the silver stream of Cydnus thou 
in Venus shape come sail while the air 
be ravish with thy music and the wind 
in amorous gale do kiss thy silken sail 
thy maid in grace habit do attend 
and boy like Cupid paint quiver bear 
while thousand Cupid in those starry eye 
stand ready draw to wound the stout heart 

you come like mar himself in threaten arm 
to ruin i and my poor country then 
I take that shape because I know no strength 
no power on earth be able to resist 
the conquer fury of Antonius 

that face of thou resist i and do 
so sweet conquer I be proud to yield 
and more rejoice in that captivity 
than any Roman in a triumph do enter Hipparchus 
how now what news with thou 

letter from Rome my lord 

from who 

Geminius 

tomorrow we will peruse they no affair 
of what import or height soever shall have 
power to disturb the pleasure of this night 
our theme tonight be love which oft have make 
the thunderer himself a while lie by 
the weary burden of his government 
Come lead away 
it be fit to read they now 
none know what gain a little time may be 

you may peruse they Titius lead away exeunt 
can no affair of what import soever 
break one night pleasure well Antonius 
the totter state thou hold must be support 
by noble virtue or it can stand 

Cyprus Phoenicia Coelosyria 
three wealthy kingdom get with Roman blood 
and our forefather valour give away 
as the base hire of a adulterous bed 
be Cyprus conquer by the sober virtue 
of Marcus Cato to be thus bestow 

this act will please young Caesar 

it will displease 
the senate Marcus and antonius friend 

Alas he know not what true friendship mean 
but make his friend his slave and which be worse 
slave to his lust and vice can he else 
slight our advice so man who Rome have see 
wear her high honour and of birth 
as great as he unless he change his mind 
I shall believe my friendship be ill place 
and strive to place it better 

this last act 
will quick be at Rome 

they have enough 
already noble Plancus think you not 
it will be censure that the roman name 
be much dishonour by that base surprise Dio Cass Plutarch 
of Artavasdes the armenian king 
who through the street of Alexandria 
he lead in triumph bind with golden chain 
force the captive king if all his threat 
can have enforce so much prostrate to adore 
proud Cleopatra as if all his act 
and all the honour of his arm be due 
to she and not to Rome Calvisius too Plutarch 
in senate late accuse he for bestow 
on Cleopatra that so far renown 
and famous library of Pergamus 
in which there be two hundred thousand book 
how many such wild action have she charm 
enforce his weakness to 

his testament 
which now at Rome the vestal virgin keep 
of which we two be privy to the seal 
shall it be know will stir all roman hate 
will his body though he die at Rome Dio Plutarch 
to be inter at Alexandria 
but if a war betwixt he and Caesar grow 
as needs it must although not yet declare 
for Caesar now be levy man and money 
through Italy Spain France and Germany 
against what foe can his design be bend 
but our Antonius if a war I say 
betwixt they shall happen tell i noble Titius 
what shall we do 

fight for Antonius 

true friend be he himself or be there hope 
or possibility he can be so 
but shall our valour toil in sweat and blood 
only to gain a roman monarchy 
for Cleopatra and the effeminate rout 
of base Canope shall her timbrel fright 
Rome Capitol and her advance pride 
tread on the neck of captive senator 
or which be more shall the earth imperial seat Dio 
remove from Rome to Egypt swarthy sand 
for who can tell if mad Antonius 
have promise she as Caius Marius once 
promise the Samnite to transfer the state 

it may be so his dotage be enough 
to grant it she her pride enough to ask it 
Manutius plancus in this whole discourse 
thou speak my very thought no more here come 
Lucilius whither so fast enter Lucilius 

my lord 
down to the fort to wait upon the consul 
the Roman consul both Titus Domitius Dio Sueton 
and Caius Sassius be from Rome arrive 
here at Pelusium what the matter be 
Is not yet know 

we will go along with thou 
this now begin to look like business Marcus exeunt 

it be not the place nor marble wall that make 
a senate lawful or decree of power 
but convocation of the man themselves 
the sacred order by true magistrate 
then Rome be here here both her consul be 
here be her axe and her falces bear 
and no small number of that sacred order 
be here assist when the barbarous Gaul 
have take Rome when all the senate flee 
and with Camillus their dictator then 
at Veii live Rome then at Veii be 
as now in Egypt father know the face 
of your assembly know your lawful power 
consult decree and act whatever may be 
happy and prosperous for the commonwealth 

while power of law while reverence of the senate 
and due respect to a consul dignity 
can give protection to the consul person 
we do maintain thy cause Antonius 
against proud Caesar faction now since law 
be put to silence and the senate force 
the consul sacred privilege infringe 
by rage and lawless arm we be expel 
and suffer banishment to be restore 
and reendenize by thy conquer sword 
now just draw it fate approve thy cause 
and on thy conquest set a glorious prize 
great than all thy former war can give 
Sextus Pompeius Marcus Lepidus 
be ruine both and all competitor 
be take away fortune have leave but one 
to share the world with thou nor can thou share 
the world with he his pride will bar thy right 
and Caesar glory dim Antonius light 
thou can not shine unless alone thou shine 
or all the world or nothing must be thou 

the consulship that be design to thou 
the senate have revoke and decree 
against Cleopatra war but mean against thou 
what will their malice dare Antonius 
have fortune frown thy king and province 
revolt from thou that dare now provoke 
thy grow fortune and assist god 
their injury have make thy quarrel just 
be speedy then and lose no time of action 

Caesar be needy his italian soldier Dio plutarch 
be apt to mutiny for want of pay 
and may with ease be tempt to revolt 

we need they not our strength be great far 
than Caesar be our preparation ready 
nought but delay can question our success 
shall we decree the war 

stay noble roman 
before we publish a decree or show 
the reason our arm so just take 
weigh but with i the mean and strength we have 
know worthy friend it be no desperate war 
your valour be engage in brief thus 
our Roman strength be nineteen legion 
ten king in person will attend our camp 
the king of Africa Comagena Thrace Plutarch 
upper Cilicia Paphlagonia 
of Cappadocia Pontus Palestine 
of rich Arabia and Galatia 
our strength at sea five hundred fight ship 
well rig and man our treasury be full 
and twenty thousand talent to the war 
do Cleopatra free contribute 
why speak I more the crown of all my strength 
our love and spirit be the injury 
on which we ground our just and lawful war 
be brief these Caesar unjust hold 
those province and army all that late Dio Plutarch 
belong to Pompey and to Lepidus 
refuse to divide they or deliver 
the moiety which appertain to i 
though oft demand by my friend at Rome 
and letter from myself beside he levy 
both man and money over all Italy 
which country as you know by our agreement 
belong to both and shall be hold in common 

most true 

these wrong be past all sufferance 
thy war be but defensive to regain 
thy own unjust take 

the war be just 

and Caesar the beginner of these broil 
from who the wrong first spring most just may 
be judge a enemy to the peace of Rome 

if fortune aid we in a cause so just 
and we return victorious noble roman 
I make a vow and let it be record 
within two month after the war be end Dio 
I will lay down the government I hold 
and free then resign my power again 
unto the senate and the people of Rome 

let it be six month rather for two month Dio 
will be too short a time to settle it 

Sossius speak well my lord 

let it be so 
and all the god assist i as I mean 
a just and true performance 

all the god 
preserve Antonius father of his country 

author and champion of our liberty 

let they believe that list for i I think 
the resignation of a power so great 
will be a temperance too great for he 
ere to express 

or if he will he must 
take leave of Cleopatra and her pride 
will hardly grant he that 

nor will I fight 
to make her mistress of the world and he 
have you consider noble friend of what 
we late speak 

and be resolve Marcus 
the friend and follower we shall bring with we 
will make we welcome guest to Caesar side 
it seem the city favour Caesar much 
that both the consul flee from Rome for fear 
nor be our action base the scorn and wrong 
well have endure at Cleopatra hand Plutarch 
will tempt a moil to fury and both side 
stand equal yet 

come let we away it be time Dio 

Egypt farewell 

farewell Antonius exeunt 

how sudden the scene be change here 
from love and banquet to the rough alarm 
and threaten noise of war 

the change Seleucus 
be not so sudden as you speak this storm 
have be expect long the two great lord 
of all the roman world Antonius 
and Caesar have in heart be enemy 
these many year and every man have wonder 
it have be withhold so long consider 
how much complain have be daily make 
by they their friend and faction against each other 
who cause be just let the god determine 

no other justice than ambition 
make they to draw their sword no other cause 
then that the world can endure two sun 

the thing that trouble i Seleucus be 
I hear it speak in the court the queen 
herself in person will associate 
antonius to the war 

I hear that rumour 
but hope it be not true how naked 
and in what great confusion will this land 
be leave and what addition can her person 
among so many Roman legion 
bring to Antonius 

let we inquire 
the certainty I fain will be resolve 

I necessity must know before 
the queen can go that order may be take 
about the fort I keep what strength she mean 
to leave within it in her absence 

true 
that reason will excuse thou for inquire exeunt 

noble Canidius I will entrust no more 
nor use more circumstance for I know 
to who I have refer my business 
and trust your wisdom 

royal Cleopatra 
I be so fortify with reason now Plutarch 
that maugre Sossius and Domitius 
with all their best persuasion I will prevail 
you shall not stay behind fear it not madam 

brave Roman wear this jewel for my sake 
and be possess of Cleopatra love 
second my suit there lie not in my power 
a thing to grant I shall deny Canidius 

the favour madam you can give have power 
to oblige the great monarch of the world 

be ready worthy friend he will straight be here Exit Can 
none but Canidius have the power to work 
Antonius in this action which the rest 
will all oppose I know a thing on which 
my state my hope and fortune all depend 
he must persuade Antonius to take 
i with he to the war for if I stay 
behind he here I run a desperate hazard 
for shall Octavia interpose herself 
in this great war as once before she do 
and make her brother and her husband friend 
where be Cleopatra then but here he come 

sweet Cleopatra I shall plead excuse 
for leave thou awhile but that the cause 
be of a nature so immense and high 
and bring effect of such advantage home 
that thou I know art please it shall be so 
and with a patience can resolve to bear 
so small a absence that my wish return 
may call thou mistress of the subject world 

can Antonius then be fortunate 
if Cleopatra go Is there in i 
so bad a omen do I think there be 
not for the world will I desire to bear 
you company but rather die at home 

far be my thought from give entertainment 
to such fond dream I will not venture thou 

my life and fortune both depend on you 
as much in Egypt will my danger be 
as in your army and my torment more 
to die each hour for fear and to remain 
in sad suspense till messenger can bring 
the news so far but if my company 
distaste my lord I can wish his grief 

can Cleopatra think her heavenly presence 
can be distasteful or not value more 
than all joy else part from thou I think 
all place sad all land disconsolate 
before this life I prize thy company 
but must not have it now do not entreat 
I have deny it to myself already 
and in the camp shall be ashamed to rise 
from Cleopatra arm when war rough noise 
shake all the world when king and senator 
be venture life and fortune in my service 
o stay behind and let thy presence make 
Egypt a place to which I will desire 
of Caesar fortune conquer to retire 

if that shall happen which the god avert 
what land alas can comfort i or lend 
a safe retreat to vanquish Antony 
thou will disdain to draw a wretched breath 
and I as much shall scorn captivity 
but I have think the roman Antony 
have love so great a queen with noble love 
not as the pleasure of his wanton bed 
or mistress only of some loose hour 
but as a partner in his high care 
and one who soul he think be fit to share 
in all his danger all his deed of honour 
without that love I shall disdain the other 

do not mistake i noble queen I know 
thy breast be full of high heroic worth 

how can you think it so that can so long 
in time of peace and pleasure recreate 
yourself with i in Egypt court yet now 
when honour call reject my company 

I shall desire it rather than my life 
but that my Roman friend be all against it 
see here they come if they agree it be do 
now noble friend on who oraculous counsel 
and matchless valour my whole fate depend 
speak what you think shall Cleopatra go 
in person to the war or stay behind 

I have deliver my opinion 
and so have my colleague 

what think Canidius 

I think it be fit my lord the queen who bounty 
have bring so great assistance to the war 
shall not be leave behind beside her presence 
will much encourage her egyptian soldier 
of which a great part of the fleet consist Plutarch 

it be true Canidius 

let not my sex 
disparage i for which of all those king 
that now in person serve antonius 
have more experience in affair of weight 
than I my lord which have so long be privy 
to your high counsel and in love to you 
and your design who shall compare with i 

what think you friend you hear Canidius 

if you be please I will subscribe 

and I 
since thing go so 

my wish be effect 

Titius and Plancus be both flee to Caesar 

you shall not need their help my lord at all 

come let we away 

my strength be ready all 
and wait but your command 

Look like Bellona 
Canidius return you to your charge 
and bring those sixteen cohort down to sea Plutarch 
meet i at Samos with they both the consul 
shall go along with i great father mar 
and all you god that from the sky behold 
the Roman labour who propitious aid 
advance my fortune to so great a height 
make perfect that which you yourselves begin 
this be the sword last work the judge hour 
of nation fate of i and Caesar power 
on which the star and destiny attend 
and all the fortune of mankind depend exeunt 

that dire portent send from the wrathful god 
threaten the astonish world what plague be those 
which in the sky prodigious face I read 
tumultuous nature teem with monstrous birth 
as if the throw will break her labour womb 
what ruin less than chaos shall involve 
the mourn face of nature what great fate 
what kind of mischief be it o you god 
why do you add to wretched man a care 
so past their strength to bear to let they know 
by sad presage their ensue woe 
unknown and secret let your vengeance be 
and none foresee their follow misery 
but hope as well as fear Jove hide thy doom 
keep shut o fate your adamantine book 
let not the painful curiosity 
of humane knowledge search your secret counsel 
and read your purpose to nourish so 
a kill fear before the danger grow 

that comet be go 

it move direct upward 
and do not vanish till it seem to reach 
the firmament 

what talk you of my son 

that comet father over the grecian sea 

it be a strange one both for form and greatness 
and bode some mischief wheresoever it light 
the god avert it from our Egypt coast 

Pinnarius Scarpus have receive news 
that Italy and Rome itself be fill 
with prodigy a ugly owl of late

Alas my son there need no prodigy 
to show the certain loss of Italy 
for on both side do Roman eagle stand 
and Rome must bleed who ere be conqueror 
beside her liberty for ever lose 
when this sad field be fight but that be not all 
what clime so far what region so remote 
but that the roman fortune reach thither 
all nation share in this 

what have thou get 
by all thy conquest Rome by all the blood 
which thy ambition through the world have shed 
but raise a power which now thou can not rule 
nourish a lion to devour thyself 

will none but Roman blood may quench the fire

I will go within and make a offering 
to great Osiris Exit Achoreus 

well may it succeed 
Egypt will flourish if Antonius conquer 

if he shall fall the fury of the war 
will light on Egypt most and we shall rue 
that ere Antonius love this hapless land

and fear behold it on those fruitful plain 
that southward lie from Alexandria 
where never rain be know to fall before 〈◊〉

a purple die upon those verdant field 
and in the cloud that horrid noise be hear 
that meet army make beat of drum 
shrill trumpet sound armour against armour clash 
as if the blood that fall drop from the wound Dio

what heaven be please to send we much endure 

true son and let a wise man place his strength 
within himself nor trust to outward aid 
that whatsoever from the god can come 
may find he ready to receive their doom exeunt 

it be not Antonius worthy soldier

what he can claim you have perform already 
and serve he true while he be to you 
a general to Rome a magistrate 
you be discharge from all obedience 
you owe to he by fate itself and may 
nay ought to follow he who Roman fate 
appoint your general the noble Caesar 
great Julius heir not to his name alone 
but spirit and fortune which have both appear 
in this so great and final a defeat 
give to Antonius before we know not 
to who the god and fortune have assign 
our service soldier now they have declare 
and let we follow where they please to lead 
for faith be impious strive to sustain 
that side who fall the god themselves ordain 

Caesar Caesar Caesar 

your judgment guide you right for can you think 
so small a strength as we can raise again 
the desperate state of fall Antonius 
under who ruin all those legion sink 
what madness be it soldier to prefer 
a hopeless civil war before the weal 
and peace of Rome and desperate provoke 
the prosperous fortune of victorious Caesar 
I have already to Cornelius Gallus Dio 
by letter signify our purpose 
who send from Caesar now be march hither 
to join his strength with we but hark his drum 
give notice of his come

ah hail Cornelius Gallus 
most wish for a most happy arrive

sole lord of all 

ay and my soldier 
with Paraetonium be at Caesar service 
whither be Antonius flee 

hither to Egypt 
with Cleopatra it be a victory 
so strange give away as not the like 
in former time I think have ere be hear 
on which especial so great a price 
as the sole sway of all the world depend 
the fleet encounter both while with the camp 
on either shore stand to behold the fight Dio 
here the caesarian there the antonian fleet 
with equal hope come on with fury equal 
and long maintain a sharp and cruel fight 
with mutual slaughter while the ocean face 
be force to lose his colour and receive 
a crimson die the ship Antonius have 
be tall and slow do like castle move 
but Caesar small yet quick and active stir Dio Florus Plutarch 
on every side with all advantage 
long fortune doubt and bright victory 
know not which way to lean but keep they both 
in equal balance till Antonius 
himself at last betray his glorious hope 
for when his mistress Cleopatra flee Plutarch Dio Florus 
although a while within his manly breast 
the roman honour strive against wanton love 
love get the conquest and Antonius 
flee after she leave his soldier there 
to sell their life in vain who many hour 
though he be flee make good the naval fight 
and have Antonius stay it may be fear 
Caesar have not prevail at last the fleet 
want their admiral though not without 
much slaughter flee or yield all to Caesar 

but what become of all his strength on land 

nay there be the wonder there be Antonius madness 
and such a madness as will strike amazement 
to all that hear it tell after his flight 
he never return though in the camp he have 
under the conduct of Canidius 
and other captain nineteen legion 
fresh and unfought which may with reason hope 
have he be there to have recover all 
they still remain encamp and though oft 
solicit by Caesar to revolt 
be keep from yield by Canidius 
in hope of Antony return until 
Canidius fear his own soldier mind Plutarch 
and Caesar anger flee away by night 
they then despair yield all to Caesar 
who by this time I think be arrive in Egypt 
about Pelusium 

will you view the town 

with all my heart noble Pinnarius exeunt 

Antonius then with Cleopatra flee 
to Alexandria 

it be certain Caesar 

they say the vanquish queen most cunning Dio 
fear it seem to be exclude else 
from her own kingdom feign herself victorious 
land in Egypt with triumphant song 
her ship all crown with laurel to deceive 
the credulous people where be enter once 
she leave unpractised no strange tyranny 
and as we hear to win the parthan king 
unto her side behead Artavasdes Dio 
king of Armenia and the parthian so 
who be her prisoner that Artavasdes 
who Anthony so base have surprise 

Caesar it be fit to take Pelusium 
before we march to Alexandria 

it be our intent good Titius not to leave 
a town of that import behind our back 
go Proculeius summon it and know 
whether the governor will yield or no Exit Proc 
what news with thou 

Caesar a messenger 
from Cleopatra crave admittance 

bring he 
queen Cleopatra to great Caesar wish 
all health and victory and humble proffer 
herself and all her fortune to his service Dio 
in token of which she here present by i 
this crown and sceptre 

brave and ominous 

humbly entreat Caesar noble favour 
to she and she the rest of her desire 
so please it Caesar to peruse the same 
this letter hold 

I warrant a loveletter 

but tell i first where be Antonius 

I will true tell though it may seem to some 
incredible that great Antonius 
a man of late in conversation 
so free and full of jollity in a strange 
deep melancholy have retire himself Plut Strabo lib 17 
to Pharos I will where like athenian Timon 
who do profess a hatred to mankind 
and flee all company he live alone 
and on the solitary shore have build 
a little house to feed his frantic humour 
and imitate that Timon life who name 
he take unto himself no friend at all 
nor servant be admit to his presence 
but only two Roman Lucilius 
and Aristocrates the grecian 

not Cleopatra than I doubt the man 
grow weary of these worldly vanity 

I never hear of such a change as this 
give i the letter I will peruse it now he read 

here the woman write 
that for her liberty and to confirm 
the crown of Egypt to herself and child 
to gratify my favour she have hide Dio Plutarch 
within her palace a great mass of gold 
unknown to Antonius 

it be like enough 
for Cleopatra rich and long have be 
beside the sacrilege she late do 
in rob all the temple of the god 
about these part 

I will not lose this gold 
nor willing let Cleopatra die 
before her person have adorn my triumph 

that will be hard to bring to pass and must 
be wrought with subtlety you must not send 
a threaten message back for if you do 
all be lose her life her gold and all be vanish 
for Cleopatra as in all her act 
it have appear be of a wondrous spirit 
of a ambition great than her fortune 
have ever be though she so long have sway 
a sovereignty over half the Roman world 
tread on the neck of humble king and rule 
Antonius as her slave her haughty spirit 
will never stoop so much as to a thought 
of such captivity 

I do not mean 
to let she know my mind or once suspect 
if I can help it but I have it now 
Thyreus come hither I must now rely 
upon thy wisdom care and diligence 
in a employment that concern i near 
but I be confident go with this fellow Dio Plutarch 
to Alexandria use to the queen 
thy best and most persuasive oratory 
tell she I love she and extreme dote 
on her admire beauty thou be wise 
and need not great instruction the success 
I do not doubt the woman credulous 
and think all man be bind to be in love 
with that ensnare face if thou perceive 
she will be wrought on win she to betray 
Antonius to my hand the way to woo her 
I leave good Thyreus to thy eloquence 
and cunning work of it spare thy reply to Euph 
bid he come hither commend my hearty love 
to Cleopatra bid she fear no ill 
from i at all what I desire from she 
my free man Thyreus have commission 
to utter to herself Epaphroditus 
so see he well reward 

health to Caesar exeunt Epa and Euph 
the governor be stout and do resolve 
to stand the extreme hazard of the war 
before he yield Pelusium 

let he rue 
his stubborn loyalty soldier make ready 
for the assault it be shame so small a town 
shall stay our fortune in the full career exeunt 
here bury do I lie thou gentle wave Callimahi epigr de Timone 
keep hateful man from tread Timon grave 
reader be go inquire no more of i 
a curse upon thou whatsoever thou be 

good good o Timon Athens never can boast 
a wise philosopher but thou thou know 
the nature of all man that all be false 
true Timon true they be all knave indeed 
thou wise hate that wicked thing call man 
who other force philosopher admire 
and call a noble creature and partaker 
of divine nature they be fool fool Timon 
all other sect be fool and I will follow 
no sect but thou I be a Timonist 
that be not enough Timon himself I be 
yonder he sit see Aristocrates 
how much unlike that great Antonius 
who person late so many legion guard 
so many king attend as their lord 

Antonius where thou be deceive Lucilius 
that be Timon man 

how can thou jest at this 
this woeful passion which alone be enough 
to melt his foe and Caesar into tear 

we feed this foolish passion to give way 
and keep aloof thus I will go to he Timon 

ha what be thou be go I say from i 
get you to Caesar man I hate you all 

I hate thou Timon do thou think it be love 
have bring i hither I be come to vex thou 

o welcome what be thy name be it Alcibindes 

have thou forget i 

do thou hate all man 

why do thou think i so unnatural 
to love a man but may we not love woman 

yes they may be belove provide always 
that they be false 

true Timon wicked woman 
may be belove because they ruin man 

right right and now I better think upon it 
I will set no gallow or gibbet up 
as I intend once for man to come 
and hang themselves I will keep a bawdy house 

a better way by far it will ruin more 
I wonder Timon at that foolish plot 
that I have hear that in thy garden once 
in Athens thou do set up gallow 
for man in discontent to hang themselves 
how few think thou will be so mad to do it 
but to a wench they will come and then the office 
that thou shall have will be of more account 
for where have you a man of any fashion 
that now adays turn hangman but a pandar 
be on employment that befit a statesman 
a thing require good part and gravity 

I will try that course but it be too slow a plot 
o for a speedy way to kill the world 
I have do somewhat in my day my war 
and bloody battle be not make in vain 
for I be once Antonius and a roman 
as in the war of Troy Pythagoras 
before that transmigration of his soul 
have be Euphorbus 

thou be like he still 

and when I be triumvir first at Rome 

that be a time indeed than I can hear 
of those good deed which must be still a comfort 
to your good conscience though they be past 
when Rome be fill with slaughter flow with blood 
but they perchance be knave that be proscribe 
and may have do more mischief have they live 

no they be honest man I look to that 

it be well and careful 

behold the list 
but one among the rest most comfort i 
that talk fellow Cicero that use 
to tax the vicious time and be forsooth 
a lover of his country 

out upon he 
than he be right serve for be it fit 
in a well govern state such man shall live 
as love their country have it not be for he 
Catiline plot have thrive 

it be true I be sure 
Caesar be on that side he favour it 

yes Caesar understand himself there be hope 
that this young Caesar too will prove as good 
a patriot as ere his father be 

he will do reason man he be of nature 
cruel enough in that proscription 
it do appear but now he will reign alone 

o for such faction as be then afoot 
to rend the state and fill the world with slaughter 

o let i hug thou Alcibiades 

be that he yonder what strange shape be that 

none talk with he but Aristocrates 
who follow his own way and suit just 
with his conceit think to reclaim he so 

the news that I shall bring will make he worse 
and fright that little reason that be leave 
quite from his breast 

it can so Canidius 
perchance to hear the extremity of all 
will cure his fit it can make he worse 
for death itself be better and more noble 

how weak a thing be man that seat his hope 
in fortune slippery and unconstant favour 
and seek no sure strength to guard his soul 
want a strong foundation he be shake 
with every wind overthrow by every storm 
and what so frequent as those storm in fortune 
who fair weather never bring assurance 
of perpetuity but come what will 
I will tell he all 

do good Canidius 

well Alcibiades I be resolve 
I will to the war again and either conquer 
my enemy or take a course to starve 
and kill up my own soldier and so be 
revenge on somebody one of these two 
may easy be bring to pass how think thou 

yes yes but let we to court and there consult 
see who come here now for our bawdy project 
here be a servant I must needs prefer 
well verse in bawdry master of the art 
Come near brave Mardio come 

my business 
be not to you 

mark he but well and tell i 
how he will execute the place 

my lord 
the queen entreat your presence at the palace 
the grieve queen who in your absence pine 
who suffer in your grief 

Well urge old eunuch 

ha what of she will she revolt to Caesar 

she be far from that my lord 

what be it he say 

he say the constitution of her body 
can hold out unless you visit she 

the queen shall know it Aristocrates 

do you not say she pine and languish sir 
and what be the difference tell your tale yourself 

what do she say do she not hate i man 

o no my lord she love you as her life 
no spite of fortune that she have endure 
or can hereafter fear grieve she so much 
as do your absence and strange melancholy 

well Mardio thou be fit for the place 

my lord Antonius 

ha more man upon we 

I come to bring thou heavy news Antonius 
the force all which thou do leave encamp 
at Actium horse and foot be go to Caesar 
and all the auxiliary king no strength 
at all be leave thou but what here thou have 
at Alexandria 

ha 

This sink into he 

it make a deep impression in his passion 

and may perchance expel his other fit 

all you here yet then I have friend I see 
but tell i can you be so merciful 
as to forgive that most unmanly fit 
I have be in o I be all in blush 

my lord take better comfort 

dear friend 
I will be proof against any fortune now Plutarch 
come let we together to the court and there 
drown sadness in rich cup of Meroe wine 
and laugh at fortune malice for your sight 
more cheer my spirit than her frown can dull they 

madam all drug with pain and torment kill 
that kill with speed no easy way to death 
be wrought but by a slow and linger course 
where nature strength be by degree subdue 
and yield so decay insensible 
no art at all can make a drug that be quick 
and gentle too no poison but the asp 
of all the mortal brood of Libya snake 
kill with a sudden and yet easy death 
as if bring forth to contradict our skill 
by envious nature who disdain frail man 
shall hope to find her secret whole out 
none but that serpent madam can effect Plutarch 
what you desire of which I here have bring 

leave it good Glaucus leave the potion too 
it be quick thou say 

yes madam but too painful 
and violent 

well leave they both with i Exit Glaucus 
let none adventure on prosperity 
but with a spirit still prepare to die 
let they keep certain death still in their power 
that dare be great and happy nought but that 
free state when they be fall Well do wise 
and liberal nature on mankind bestow 
a gift so sovereign as power to die 
a antidote against fortune cruelty 
that be the dear preservative that must 
control the spite of fortune and redeem 
a woeful life from loathe servitude 
one venom be gentle other rough and cruel 
but it be not safe to trust my honour so 
on doubtful prop the poison both may fail 
or differ far from what vain fame report 
their operation it be experience 
that must confirm i Mardio be return 

here be two man madam condemn for murder 
to cruel death and be to die tomorrow 

come near both and tell i dare you die Dio 

great queen necessity strict law impose Plutarch 
that doom upon we in force action 
courage can have no trial 

dare you die 
a less dishonourable way to escape 
the common hangman hand and from a queen 
receive your death and that a easy death 

most willing great queen we be prepare 

give they their lot Mardio the short lot 
be to die first 

that lot be i 

the asp shall be thy fate now asp confirm 
what fame report of thou stay thou thy draught 
till he be dead feel thou no pain 

a faintness seize i and I will sleep 

how gentle he lie down and scarce strive 
against his death at all 

I think he be dead 
already sure he feel but little pain 
I be confirm 

he be dead and stiff already 

we will try no more as for thy draught of poison 
thus we discharge thou of it and from death 
doom by the law our royal pardon free thou 
publish it Mardio 

the god preserve 
royal and gracious Cleopatra life exeunt 

I be resolve nought but the libyan asp 
shall be renown for Cleopatra death 
thou precious worm that can redeem alone 
the loss of honour at a rate so easy 
that kill as gentle as the hand of age 
and be miscall a plague of Africa 
since thou alone make barren Africa envy 
by other land though fruitful want thou 
who across the sea and hence at high price 
transport the asp as choice merchandise 
on thou I trust one gentle touch of thou 
can free this life from loathe servitude 
from Caesar triumph the base people mock 
proud Livia scorn and mad Octavia spite 
but why be all my thought turn to despair 
why think I now of death methinks my genius 
check this cold fear and fortune chide tell i 
I be ungrateful to distrust she now 
my race of life and glory be not run 
nor Cleopatra fortune yet arrive 
at that great height that must eternize she 
and fix her glorious name above the star 
I long to hear what answer Caesar send 
I do not know his temper but he be young 
and why shall I despair be Cupid fire 
extinguish quite be all his arrow spend 
or be this beauty that can boast the conquest 
of Julius Caesar and great Antony 
so wane now it can move the temper 
of one who youth make fit for Cupid conquest 

madam your gift be more gracious receive 
and Caesar with a smile brow return 
all seem love and friendship he have send 
his freedman Thyreus to attend your highness 
and to impart his counsel to your ear 

he be welcome to we what be great Caesar will 

Caesar best wish royal Cleopatra 
none but your fair self can ratify 
no power on earth can give what Caesar want 
but you great queen for let your majesty 
give credit to poor Thyreus though the mean 
of all the servant that attend on Caesar 
there be none about he be more near in trust 
to who he be please to impart his thought 
and secret wish nothing but your love 
can crown his happiness 

we be no subject 
for Caesar mock though in our worst of fortune 

you be the queen of fortune and still hold 
a last sceptre over that fickle goddess 
fickle to other to you true and constant 
your radiant light lend that blind goddess eye 
and guide she to your service make all 
action nay loss step to great honour 
the late defeat at Actium which your error 
perchance miscall a loss be fortune labour 
to make you great and remove your brightness 
which be ill place as diamond coarse set 
from old Antonius to young Caesar love 
a fit sphere for those fair eye to shine in 

without these court Thyreus if great Caesar 
please to embrace our friendship we and Egypt 
shall do he faithful service 

mighty queen 
if my rude speech have err I humble beg 
that you will please to think it zeal in i 
to do my master service and such service 
as he esteem the best to gain your love 
I oft have hear he let your majesty 
not be offend with that truth I utter 
ravish with fame of your perfection 
and noble spirit call Antonius happy 
who fortune bring to Egypt to behold 
that queen who he so much desire to see 
but when his eye behold your portraiture 
draw by a skilful and a faithful hand 
he oft will say it be a likely seat 
to hold those grace such perfection 
be fit for none but Caesar to admire 

there be a Caesar love i once but I 
be not so proud to think it be my merit 
though he will say I do deserve far more 
than he can utter that great Julius 
who name and action fill the triple world 

though all in he be great yet nothing great 
than his adopt so divine a heir 
This Caesar madam for your dear love 
beside that power and greatness which the world 
both know and fear bring such a youth and beauty 
to plead for he as in a mean estate 
may move a princess love which that your eye 
may better read I here from he present 
his true and most unflattered portraiture 

the fair form that ere these eye behold 
where all the best of each best model meet 
Cupid sweet smile lodge in the eye of Mars 
Ganymede cheek the imperial brow of Jove 
where love and majesty be proud to dwell 

his age great queen be yet not thirty year 

I never till now see beauty but Thyreus 
may we repose a confidence in thou 
as our true friend we will deserve thy love 

to do divine Cleopatra service 
be all poor Thyreus pride in serve you 
I best discharge my duty to my master 

then brief thus because I will not have 
any take notice of long privacy 
betwixt thou and i and instant we expect 
Antonius here I will devise some mean 
how to deserve great Caesar love and act 
what he shall thank we for meanwhile stay here 
with we good Thyreus for we can yet 
dispatch thou with that message we intend 

I will attend your highness 

till anon 
farewell good Thyreus but be near about we 
what more than this can all the fate contrive 
what more than Caesar love can I have wish 
on which all power all state and glory wait 
but o the weak and fluctuate state 
of humane frailty still too much depress 
or raise too much betwixt fear and flatter hope 
but hence base fear a princely confidence 
fit Cleopatra mind and beauty better 
my dear lord 

ah sweet Cleopatra 
in this embrace and this ambrosiac kiss 
I be again possess of all my wealth 
of all my fortune have the angry god 
purpose to wreak their fury full on i 
they have not leave my life so sweet a comfort 

possess of you I stand above the reach 
of fortune threaten or proud Caesar power 
nought but your grief and melancholy have 
power to deject my spirit 

thy true worth 
deserve a happy friend that can bestow 
not take alone his happiness from thou 
in thy sweet love and these my faithful friend 
I still be happy I have lose no friend 
all that be go from i to Caesar side 
ingrateful Titius and Domitius 
Plancus Silanus Dellius and Hipparchus 
be fortune friend not i 

let we in and feast 
this day we will dedicate to mirth and freedom 
to crown your welcome hither 

sweet speak 
let not a woman teach we soldier 
to be magnanimous 

thy feast we will style 
the feast of fellowdyer for no band Plutarch 
no tie of friendship be so firm as that 
they live in love that mean to die together exeunt 

grave Arius in thy trouble look I read 
fear for thy native Alexandria 
but banish fear and know thy power with Caesar 
if they obey our summons none shall die 
but though to the utmost they resist thy will 
shall rule our justice 

humble Arius 
be too much honour in great Caesar favour 

we give but what we owe a debt so great 
as i to thou can never be overpay 
great Alexander who victorious hand 
found that city who eternize name 
for ever honour it though in great deed 
he pass our glory far shall not exceed 
Caesar in piety he oft will say 
he ought a better be to his master 
then to father one mere natural 
the other mental and divine far 
who be that 

Fergusius the philosopher 
condemn to death by you 

dispatch he then 

he crave a word with Arius ere he die 

what be it brother 

ah good Arius Plutarch 
wiseman if true wise save wise man still 

most mighty Caesar 

Arius no more 
I know what thou desire Fergusius live 
that thou know he have save thou 

victory 
and fame still wait on Caesar 

let we away 
and march with speed to Alexandria 

Caesar your horse be weary it be not fit 
too much to toil they for I fear a sally 
from Alexandria 

they dare not man 

Antonius be strong in wellprovided 
and skilful horseman and despair of favour 
since twice you have refuse his proposition 
will put another valour into he 

what conquest can Antonius hope for here 

his hope as near as I conjecture they 
be to break through your troop and get to sea 
for yet he have a fleet that may transport he 
to other land to gather new supply 
but any fortune will prove high far 
to he then stay here without all hope 
to be shut up in a besiege town 
in my opinion let your march be slow 
and gentle that the horse may be refresh 
and we prevent the worst 

let it be so exeunt 

how formless be the form of man the soul 
how various still how different from itself 
how false call queen of this little world 
when she be a slave and subject not alone 
unto the body temperature but all 
the storm of fortune 

what occasion 
make thou thus offer at philosophy 

where have thou live thou shall not know the occasion 
the fit and change of Antonius 
be theme enough how strange a love soul 
be the late hater of mankind become 

that be not strange he be out of breath with curse 
and now it be time to stop his mouth with kiss 
but what can he conceive of this same Thyreus 
that hold such secret conference with she 

he can choose but see it 

unless love 
have blind he she carry it so plain 
well I shall think if there be knavery in it 
as knavery there must be that Cleopatra 
be not so subtle as we take she for 

he must be tell it if he will not see 
upon my life there be some plot of treason 
which yet may be discover 

here they come 
let we go fetch Antonius if we can 

Pelusium shall be render up to Caesar Dio Plutarch 
by our command to our lieutenant there 
Seleucus who obedience we not doubt 

noble of queen you make imperial Caesar 
as much a debtor to your courtesy 
as he be already captive to your beauty 

nor do we wrong Antonius at all 
in give up a town which be our own 
it may be think it be do to weaken he 
alas Antonius be already fall 
so low that nothing can redeem he now 
nor make he able to contest with Caesar 
he have not only lose his army strength 
but lose the strength of his own soul and be not 
that Antony he be when first I know he 
I can do Caesar now no great service 
though I shall never want a heart to do it 
but we shall quick see the event of thing 
Antonius now be desperate and put 
his hope upon the fortune of one sally 
which will be sudden perform before 
that thou can bear a message back to Caesar 

hand on that Thyreus there to prison with he 

to prison 

yes away with he I say Plutarch 

Caesar will not have use your messenger 
so ill 

thou be not messenger to i 

for my sake dear lord 

o for your sake 
I cry you mercy lady bear he hence Exit Thyreus 
I have forget that Thyreus be your servant 
but what strange act shall he perform for you 
be it to help you to a happy friend 

can you suspect it be my true love 
so ill bestow can he for who dear sake 
a queen so high bear as I prefer 
love before fame and fond do neglect 
all name of honour when false Fulvia 
and proud Octavia have the name of wife Plutarch 
requite i thus ungrateful Anthony 
for now the fury of a wrong love 
just provoke my speech 

o Cleopatra 
it be not Thyreus but this heart of i 
that suffer now deep wound with the thought 
of thy unconstancy do fortune leave 
one only comfort to my wretched state 
and that a false one for what conference 
can thou so oft and in such privacy 
with Caesar servant hold if true to i 
which with the rack I can enforce from he 
but that I scorn to do 

you do not scorn 
to wrong with base unworthy jealousy 
a faithful heart but if you think i false 
here sheath your sword make i the subject rather 
of manly rage then childish jealousy 
it be a noble crime and fit far 
for you to act easy for i to suffer 
for live suspect I nor can nor will 
the lovely asp which I with care have keep 
and be intend a preservative 
against Caesar cruelty I now must use 
against Antonius baseness a worse foe 
than Caesar be farewell till death approve 
that I be true and you unjust in love 

stay Cleopatra dear love forgive i 
let not so small a wind have power to shake 
a love so grow as we I do not think 
that thou be false my heart give no consent 
to what my tongue so rash utter 
nor can I have outlive so sad a thought 
let Thyreus be release and send to Caesar 
now be the time to sally forth my lord 
the foe be tire with march and your horse 
be ready all and wait the signal only 
the least delay lose the action 

I come Canidius dear love farewell 
Few hour will tell thou what Antonius be exeunt 

how timorous be guilt how be my thought 
distract sad now on every side 
my danger grow for shall Antonius 
return in safety home and know what pass 
betwixt i and Thyreus I have lose his heart 
and can choose but fear he if he die 
I be not confident of Caesar love 
it be but a servant tongue I build upon 
it be best to make all sure within there Eira 

madam 

be all thing ready in the tomb 

yes madam Carmio be there and Mardio 

then thither will I go if fate contrive 
a future state of happiness for i 
it be my castle if my death they doom 
I be possess already of a tomb Exit 

defeat be my troop my fleet revolt 
the sea and land be lose and nothing now 
be leave Antonius but a roman hand 
a sword and heart to die you true servant 
who faith and manly constancy upbraid 
this wicked age and shall instruct the next 
take from a wretched hand this legacy 
fortune have make my will and nought but this 
can I bequeath you Carry it to Caesar 
if he be noble it contain enough 
to make you happy than Antonius can 
my glass of life and empire now be run 
and from this hand expect a period 

my lord take fair hope 

fie fie Lucilius 
lose not thy former merit in persuade 
a man who once thou love to such a shame 
as to prefer a loathe captivity 
before a noble death 
thy look speak grief Dio 
speak Eros where be the queen 

she be dead my lord Plutarch 
when those unhappy tiding come to she 
of your defeat she straight shut up herself 
within her tomb and die 

o Cleopatra 
why have I linger thus that thou a woman 
shall teach so old a soldier how to die 
fortune I blame not thou I have enjoy 
what thou can give and on the envy top 
of thy proud wheel have long unshake stand 
who king have serve and Rome herself obey 
who all the zone of earth diffuse globe 
that know inhabitant have know and fear 
nor be my fall so much degenerate 
my strength no arm but Roman arm subdue Plutarch 
and none but monarch of the world succeed 
glut with life and empire now I go 
free and undaunted to the shade below 
here Eros take this sword perform the promise 
which thou have make to kill i whensoever 
I shall command make no reply in word 

I will be true or die stand fair your Eros 
will be your usher to the elysian field kill himself 

what have thou do unfaithful faithful Eros Dio Plutarch 
too kind cruel false virtuous 
I will trust no more to be no more direct 
by such example but we must be speedy 
the gate ere this time be set open to Caesar 
fair Cleopatra I be come now 
to dwell with thou and ever to behold 
thy heavenly figure where nor time nor death 
shall make divorce of our eternal love 
thus thus I come to thou unfaithful sword 
I never know thou slow in give death 
till this sad hour some friendly hand lend aid 
and with another wound release my soul 
where be my lord Antonius o sad sight 
the queen enclose in her tomb desire 
to take her last leave of you 

be she live 
it be welcome news convey i quick friend Plutarc Dio exeunt 
o quick thither that I may expire 
that breath that be leave in Cleopatra arm 

go you Epaphroditus and besiege 
the palace to surprise Antonius

go present to Cleopatra tomb 
woe she with all your art and eloquence 
with all assurance of Caesar love 
to leave that place and yield her person to he 
spare no attempt of force or policy 
to draw she thence for you the citizen 
of Alexandria cheer your faint heart 
I will mediate in your behalf to Caesar 
to spare the city 

thank to the most noble 
and good Agrippa 

here he come himself 

the paleness of your fear declare your guilt 
but that though never so great shall not exceed 
our clemency to let you know it be 
your happiness to be subdue by we 
mercy shall rule our just severity 
first for your founder Alexander sake Plutarch Dio 
next for the love of reverent Arius 
our master here who goodness far outweigh 
all your offence and rebellion 

Caesar in goodness as in greatness bear 
equality with Jove 

hail mighty Caesar 

what be he 

Achoreus Osiris priest 
a good and holy man 

we dare believe thou 
and therefore welcome he 

please it great Caesar 
to give Achoreus leave to wait on he 
into the ancient temple of our god 
to show the egyptian rite and mystery 
and all the deity that we adore 

most willing Achoreus I will see Dio 
god but not ox 

he have blank the priest 

I fain will see great Alexander hearse Sueton· 
the mansion once of so divine a soul 
a spirit great than the world itself 
who the world fear but can not satisfy 

within the vault of our pyramid 
his body yet all whole may Caesar see 
and all the body of our Ptolemy 

I will see king only not dead carcase Sueton Dio 
but see Epaphroditus be return 

speak man where be Antonius 

slay my lord 

how slay what hand dare do it 

his own hand 

that be our fear cruel Antonius 
too cruel to thyself to Rome and i 
how white a day have all the people lose 
how great might Caesar happiness have be 
have but the fate permit i to lay 
these conquer arm aside and once again 
embrace thou dear Antonius as a friend 
thou worthy aider of my infant fortune Plutarch 
thou brave revenger of great Julius death 
witness these tear though I be force to war 
while thou prefer foreign love before 
Caesar alliance do reject my kindred 
and scorn my love I still can honour thou 
but since too cruel fate deny to i 
so great a happiness as to express 
this love to thou alive let thy dear ghost 
behold my piety and see the honour 
Caesar will do to thy sad funeral 

most royal caesarlike dissimulation 

I hope however it will serve our turn Lucilius 
now be the fit time 

what man be these 

two of Antonius true servant Caesar 
who bring a letter from their die lord 

let i peruse it well it shall be grant 
your life and fortune both be safe and since 
we ever love fidelity you shall 
if so you like be welcome to our service 

it be our desire our life and fortune ever 
shall do great Caesar true and faithful service 
as they before do to Antonius 

where do he die 

in Cleopatra arm 
by she with rope let up into the tomb 
after his deadly wound 

be she there still 
now I shall know speak Gallus what be the news 

we come and call at Cleopatra tomb Dio Plutarch 
who from above make answer and deny 
to yield herself but upon Caesar word 
when I with best persuasion strive to win she 
and hold her talk awhile while Proculeius 
on other side the tomb espy a place 
that open stand by which the queen receive 
die Antonius which he scale enter 
behind the queen but have he not be speedy 
she there have slay herself a maid of she 
spy Proculeius enter and aloud 
cry out o queen thou be surprise alive 
she draw a short poniard be restrain 
by Proculeius who both hold her hand 
and speak her fair at last obtain so much 
by strong persuasion of your clemency 
he draw she thence and get she to the palace 
where now she be and Proculeius stay 
but her desire be still to speak with you 
till when from we she will admit no comfort 

we will in person present go see she 
protect i Pallas against false Venus charm exeunt 
know mischief have their cure but doubt have none 
and better be despair then fruitless hope 
mix with a kill fear my thought be now 
more black and baleful than this sad attire 
if Caesar come I do not fear his chide 
I have a certain antidote against that 
it be not his anger but his love afflict 
my doubt soul whether that love will prove 
feign or true yet may straight appear 
he be not so old nor I so ignorant 
but that his action gesture word and look 
will make his heart lie open to my view 

how sweet a sorrow dwell upon that brow 
how will she look in smile dalliance 
o pardon i thou powerful god of love 
that dare presume to tempt thy deity 
forgive my confidence I now excuse 
Antonius weakness but stay there my heart 
my virtuous Livia be more fair than she 

hail mighty prince for that high name the god Dio Plutarch 
who reave i of it have bestow on thou 

rise Cleopatra Caesar victory 
take nought from you 

o let i never rise 
till Caesar grant my suit 

good queen stand up 
and free speak what you desire 

I beg 
a boon but small which Caesar never deny 
his great enemy 

and can you think 
I shall deny it you do but express it 

that thou will kill i Caesar I have live 
these many year too long I shall have die Dio 
when that great worthy that renown Caesar 
be base murder in Rome Capitol 
survive he be my unhappiness 
but I have live to see his son inherit Dio 
his state and empire and control the world 

be cheery Cleopatra fear no wrong 
at Caesar hand 

death be no wrong at all 
I have deserve it sir 

but can you think 
that we who clemency so many man 
and stubborn enemy so oft have prove 
shall now at last be cruel to a queen 
but we must chide you that so long together 
have side with Antonius and with he 
conspire the wrack of Rome 

that be soon excuse 
if it be a crime to love antonius Dio Plutarch 
which I confess I do and his large favour 
true deserve it think it be not my 
but fate own crime that first allot i 
to his protection have your share of rule 
in Egypt lie I have be Caesar friend 

beside with man and money you give aid 
to Caius Cassius in Philippi field 
who murder Caesar in the Capitol 

Caesar as false as truth itself be true 
I be accuse to Antonius Plutarch Appian 
for that before but in Cilicia 
I quick clear those causeless jealousy 
witness thou glorious star which the great soul 
of noble Julius when he leave the earth 
add to heaven how innocent I be 
from any fault in that but Caesar know Dio 
against thy father not the act alone 
but even suspicion shall be purge with death 
I can no long live 

what have I do 
I fear my rashness have too far betray Dio 
my thought to Cleopatra gentle queen 
be comfort expect at Caesar hand 
nothing but love and friendship do not wrong 
my goodness with unjust suspicion 
all former grievance be quite forget 
your port and state shall be maintain at full 
your household servant not diminish 
Epaphroditus see the queen attend 
as fit her stare and honour and till next 
we visit you rest with a full assurance 
of our best love and friendship 

all the payment 
that my poor fortune can return to Caesar 
be thank and service 

Epaphroditus 

Caesar they whisper 

yes whisper on you can overreach 
my jealousy no sign of love at all exit Caesar 
no smile nor amorous glance I be deceive 
and mere cozen by base Thyreus 
but I must hide my fear and clear this brow 
the better to effect my purpose 

how fare your majesty 

never so well 
as now I be I do not think great Caesar 
have be so full of love and courtesy 

o madam Caesar the unexampled mirror 
of royalty and do as far exceed 
all petty king in goodness as in power 
and if my humble service in aught 
may give content to royal Cleopatra 
I shall be proud to be command still 

thank good Epaphroditus 
that love be true that be show in misery 
but what have I forget I have a note 
of some particular I mean to give 
to Caesar hand and quite forget it here 
nor will I trust the carriage of a thing 
of so great consequence to every hand 

will you command my service 

I shall rest 
indebt to your love Caesar will thank you 
it much concern both his estate and i Dio 
be speedy good Epaphroditus for 
I long to hear his answer 

fear not madam 
a quick performance it rejoice i 
to see she look so cheery again Exit epa 

so now my trouble be remove I come 
I come my dear lord Antonius 
never till now thy true and faithful love 
my much abuse lord do not disdain 
or blush to acknowledge Cleopatra name 
when tear and blood have wash her spot soul 
be thou alive again not all the world 
shall shake my constancy or make divorce 
betwixt thou and i but since too late alas 
my tear of sorrow come I will follow thou 
and beg thy pardon in the other world 
all crime be there for evermore forget 
there Ariadne pardon Theseus falsehood 
Dido forgive the perjure prince of Troy 
and Troilus repentant Cressida 
though false to thou alive I now be come 
a faithful lover of thy dust and comb Exit 

Marcus Agrippa I have here provide 
as Caesar give in charge two libyan psyl 
all Africa yield not fit for his purpose 

they look like likely one 

they have be prove 
and have already on my soldier 
when they be bite by serpent do strange cure 
past all belief or hope recall flee life 
back to his mansion and beyond the power 
of Aesculapius have suck and charm 
the mortal venom from their die limb 
these two Agrippa in their infancy 
their doubt sire to try their lawful birth Plinius Solinus Lucanus 
as eagle try their eaglet against the sun 
expose to mortal serpent and be so 
confirm in what they seek the tremble snake 
dare not assault the infant 

here he come 

be those the man 

yes Caesar 

carry they 
to Cleopatra palace let they wait 
near to Epaphroditus what be the news 
how fare the queen 

never more cheery sir 
her look express her hope nor in her word 
can she conceal her inward cheerfulness 
but one thing sir she say she have forget 
which near do concern both you and she 
and that in such a cause she dare not trust 
a common messenger request i 
to give it to your hand 

she have deceive thou 
and all of we the worst that I can fear 
be come to pass o run Epaphroditus 
I will follow thou with all the speed I can 
but all too late I fear our speed will come exeunt 

this be my second coronation day 
but noble than the first and full far 
of real honour and magnificence 
nor till this pompous hour be Cleopatra 
a perfect queen alas I do not sway 
a sceptre over fortune or command 
as now I do the destiny themselves 
I wear a paint honour a mere shadow 
of royal state and such a feeble crown 
as war can threaten treason undermine 
and every puff of fortune blow it off 
my state be constant now my thought above 
the fear of danger or oppose foe 

what new addition have she get off state 

I can tell nor can I guess her meaning 

Glaucus and Mardio leave the room a while 
Come hither girl I will no long hide 
my joy from you in such attire as this 
I go to meet my dear Antonius 

madam he be dead 

Alas thou be deceive 
he live my Charmio in the other world 
and stay for i I have be too too slack 
in come to he this that here lie dead 
be but the house that lodge my dear lord 
that earthly mansion that do once contain 
the kind noble and the true soul 
that ever live and this our second meeting 
be far more sweet and full of noble love 
then when we first meet in Cilicia 
when our magnificence and pomp do fill 
the world with wonder and astonishment 
why weep you girl be it to see your mistress 
great than ere in glory if you love i 
you will weep to see great Cleopatra lead 
a wretched captive through the street of Rome 
before proud Caesar chariot mock and flout 
and from a queen become Octavia drudge 
no no my girl I will be still myself 
and from this seat of state look down in scorn 
on Rome and Caesar threat as thing below i 

nor here shall my attendance leave you madam 
I will wait upon you to the elysian shade 

nor will poor Charmio be leave behind 

my earthly race be run and I descend 
as great a ghost as theban Semele 
when her ambitious love have seek and meet 
the thunderer embrace when no pile 
of earthly wood but Jove celestial fire 
consume her beauty relic and send down 
her soul from that majestic funeral 
farewell thou fade remnant of my love 
when I be go I will leave these earthly part 
to keep thou company never to part 
but dwell together and dissolve together 
Come asp possess thy mansion free feed 
on these two hill upon who snowy top 
the wing Cupid oft have take stand 
and shoot from thence the proud heart on earth 
corruption now and rottenness must seize 
this once admire fabric and dissolve 
this flesh to common element again 
when skilful nature be she strict bind 
to search through all her storehouse will be pose 
to tell which piece be Cleopatra once 
sweet asp I feel thy touch and life begin 
from these cold limb to take her gentle flight 
a slumber seize i farewell my girl 
thus let the roman find i dead and know 
maugre the power of Rome and Caesar spleen 
that Cleopatra live and die a queen 

she be dead and Eira too I hear a noise 
there be no dally now I must be speedy 
and use the common and sure way to death 

we come too late and all in vain I fear 
our care have be 

here lie her servant bleed 
not dead speak Charmio how die the queen 

a death that well beseem her royal birth 〈◊〉 

see Caesar see the mark upon her breast 
and here the fatal author 

it be the asp 
be speedy now and use your utmost power sueton Dio 
you skilful psyl call back this royal soul 
to her fair seat and take from Caesar bounty 
above your wish suck thou the wound place 
and mutter thou thy strong charm to fright 
pale death from thence and you infernal god 
if ere to humane prayer you can lend 
a exorable ear it be Caesar beg 
Caesar who sword have send to your black shade 
a hundred thousand soul and still have power 
to enlarge your empire beg in lieu of all 
but restitution of one soul alone 

how royal she die 

no conquer prince 
do ever find a noble way to death 
have feeble Perseus know so brave a course 
he have redeem his captive life from shame 
and not deprive the conqueror of fame 

be there no hope 

she be go past all recovery 

we will no long strive against destiny 
though thou be dead yet live renown for ever 
and let this action speak thou to the world 
a foe not shame Caesar victory 
no other crown or sceptre after thou 
shall Egypt honour thou shall be the last 
of all the reign race of Ptolomey 
and all and more than what thy letter crave 
will Caesar grant with dead Antonius 
in rich state than ere proud Memphis see Sueton Dio Plutarch 
her king inter shall Cleopatra lie 
thy die figure carve in fair stone 
shall my triumphant chariot wear for all 
to gaze and wonder at thy form and worth 
Egypt no more a kingdom now a province 
Cornelius Gallus be thy government 
and here let Caesar sheath the civil sword 
who fatal edge these twenty year have rip 
the bleed entrails of afflict Rome 
here let our labour end advance brave friend 
our prosperous eagle home to Italy 
to reap the fruit of all our war and toil 
and fill great Rome with conquer Egypt spoil
