now be the time noble Vitellius 
for you and you most honour Pollio 
to make that service you have do complete 
to royal Agrippina brief thus 
the two commander of the praetorian camp 
Crispinus Rufus and that Lucius Geta 
must be displace and some of near trust 
to her design advance in their room 
or else our power will never be full they love 
Britannicus too well this be the thing 
the empress wish let your eloquence 
and wisdom further it in Caesar ear 

fear we not Pallas but what successor 
have we to take their charge 

one must take all 
you may pretend the inconvenience 
of two commander and so take from Caesar 
all jealousy of the plot 

who shall it be 

Burrhus Afranius a wise valiant man 
belove and honour by the soldier 
none can except against he and the change 
will not displease the camp nor can his merit 
make he less thankful to she know well 
it be in her power to make it otherwise 
but the advance of such able man 
as Seneca and Burrhus will take off 
all envy from the empress and ourselves 
then we with praise have wrought our purpose 
and make our party strong while Seneca 
shall sway the senate Burrhus rule the camp 
to her design but I will presume no far 
to instruct your wisdom or much less to doubt 
your true affection to the state and honour 
of Agrippina who will then have power 
to make more large requital to her friend 
in which most high and happy rank you two 
be chief seat she acknowledge 
herself indebt to your eloquence 
noble Vitellius who in senate late 
you prove her marriage lawful and be censor 
depose Silanus from his praetorship 
who shall have marry young Octavia 
to you brave Pollio who persuasion 
have be the cause young Nero now enjoy 
that happy marriage which Silanus lose 
but most of all she owe to both your pain 
in cause Caesar to adopt she Nero 

it be hard to work at first Caesar stick at it 
allege that the claudian family 
never adopt any and beside 
when Lucius Geta and Crispinus Rufus 
in love they bear to young Britannicus 
tell he that that adoption to the world 
will be ridiculous by precedent 
we do refute it show how Tiberius 
have a son and nephew both alive 
adopt the issue of Germanicus 

my lord it be noble carry this design 
that now we have in hand though not so hard 
to work will prove as advantageous 
be you with Caesar I will go satisfy 
the empress of your love 

farewell brave Pallas exeunt Vitel and Pol 

farewell my lord go flatter senator 
go use your best persuasive eloquence 
while I alone upon your envy rise 
while I enjoy in Agrippina love 
the fruit of your obsequious diligence 
what though my birth be humble and my style 
but one of Caesar freedman though I boast not 
patrician blood nor in my gallery 
display old rank of noseless ancestor 
or earcrop image if I enjoy 
whatever high nobility can give 
respect and power the state can witness it 
the senate fear i and in flattery 
have sue to Caesar to confer on i 
praetorian and quaestorian ornament 
which I at last vouchsafe to accept 
when my command alone have doom to death 
the noble of that order man who name 
old Rome have boast of who virtue raise 
she to that envy height that now she hold 
their murder stupid Caesar rather choose 
to take upon himself then question i 
let dull patrician boast their airy title 
and count i base while I commend their life 
and for the furtherance of my high intent 
make noble man my hate instrument 
but ha Narcissus yes there come a man 
that be my rival once who I fear more 
than all the lord of Rome my fellow free man 
that know our way of power that not the senate 
but Caesar chamber do command the world 
and rule the fate of man but fortune be turn 
and he not worth my regard or fear 
in master he I feel my great strength exit 

not look upon i be I fall so low 
do I in equal place with this proud man 
nay far above he sway the state and rule 
great Caesar heart while Messalina live 
and be not there content o punishment 
of my ambitious aim but cause the death 
of that loose empress to bring in the expulse 
Aelia Petina and instead of her 
have let this tigress Agrippina in 
this dragon spirit to devour we all 
except proud Pallas her adulterer 
what unavoided danger every way 
threaten this life for if young Nero reign 
I die that seek to cross his mother match 
if ere Britannicus do reign I die 
that cause his mother death what shall I do 
where shall I lean for safety better trust 
the innocent goodness of Britannicus 
then Agrippina fierce and cruel nature 
nor can I hope more goodness from her son 
that may give long respite to my fear 
beside it bear the great show of justice 
and honest service to my royal master 
since we must fall it be some happiness 
to fall the honest way if we may call 
that honesty at all or real virtue 
to which necessity enforce we 
and we by fortune not election practise 
here come two friend of young Britannicus 
hail Lucius Geta hail Crispinus Rufus 

Narcissus hail 

brave roman your be come 
fit to ease my overburden breast 
of weighty thought which I dare free trust 
unto your noble ear 

you may Narcissus 
trust truth with we 

or any honest secret 

what be it you will with we 

you know my lord 
and I must needs confess I be a mean 
of Messalina death but all the god 
can witness with i how unwilling 
I lend a hand to that sad action 
and but for Caesar safety which I prize 
above my life and fortune and which then 
I think endanger much by her hold act 
nought in the world can ere have move i to it 

what hence will you infer 

then know my lord 
how little I respect my private end 
to do the public service and can lose 
myself for Caesar good it may be think 
when the most hopeful prince Britannicus 
shall wear that wreath which all the world adore 
to i it may be fatal as a foe 
unto his mother but I rather wish 
myself for ever lose then that brave prince 
shall not succeed his father 

how succeed 
what fear be there of that 

what power on earth 
can bar his right while we command the camp 
I will rather see which all the god avert 
Rome rend again with civil broil than he 
shall lose unjust the imperial throne 

you be true and noble friend and here I vow 
to join with you and use my uttermost power 
to advance the honour of Britannicus 

what danger threaten it 

do you not know 
to who the son of Agrippina marry 

yes 

and that honour be enough for he 
without adoption too be his aim private 
and that his crafty mother do not cast 
a way for he to the succession 

it be strange do of Caesar I confess 

they make the faction strong and cunning 
increase the train of Nero and displace 
the faithful servant of Britannicus 
wise Seneca recall from banishment 
by Agrippina mean not for the love 
she bear his virtue but to make he she 
that Seneca authority may gain 
the people love to her ambitious son 
of who young year he take tuition 

I think no less 

beside to make the match 
for her young Nero with Octavia 
noble Silanus die who may have prove 
a faithful prop to Claudius family 

in blood that fatal marriage be begin 
I fear the omen Agrippina fierce 
and cruel nature have too much be see 
in this short time Lollia Paulina niece 
to Cotta Messalinus and late wife 
to Caius Caesar for no other cause 
then aim once at Claudius marriage 
be banish Italy her good be seize 
and but five million of sesterce leave she 
of all her great estate but there the malice 
of this fell woman stay not now we hear 
a tribune be dispatch away to kill 
the banish lady and bring back her head 

o barbarous cruelty 

yet more I fear 
since her Domitius be adopt now 
I fear she will short aim at high blood 

we will guard the life of young Britannicus 

and I will be vigilant for Caesar safety 
when all her end be wrought his death be next 

here come the youthful hope of Rome and we 

tell i my friend be not I Caesar son 

my lord who dare to question it 

I be sure 
I be his elder son and while I live 
I think that Caesar have not lack a heir 
but I at last have find a elder brother 
Domitius be adopt Caesar son 
his name be Nero now I can tell 
what be my fault 

excellent youth how much 
beyond his year he apprehend his wrong 

fear not sweet prince though Agrippina son 
be two year elder than yourself the senate 
will never judge that a adopt son 
shall in succession be prefer before 
the true and natural heir 

you ever love i 
pray do so still 

while we have breath my lord 
you shall command our life 

how unaware 
have feeble Caesar wrought a snare to catch 
his own unhappy life in grow sweet prince 
grow up to strengthen the imperial house 
and curb the furious malice of thy foe 

brother Britannicus hail 

Haile to you 
Domitius Aenobarbus 

do you scorn 
my salutation or not know my name 

that be your father name and why not you 

how be that proud boy exeunt Brit and reliq 

well let they go my lord 
it be not the brain of young Britannicus 
that can give birth to this minurious scorn 
though for his year the boy be capable 
but ripe head than his there go his counsel 
Crispinus Rufus and that Lucius Geta 
who swell the youth with boast hope and think 
their power can give protection to his pride 
I will make they see their error and perceive 
one breath of i can blow they from their strength 
this news I will bear to Agrippina straight 
Come prince Britannicus shall find anon 
what feeble prop his pride have lean upon exeunt 

you be my judge 

your poor servant madam 

nay that must be your office you have read 
my commentary over and I look for 
a faithful censure I be sure my lord 
you have both learning able to discern 
and such integrity as will not flatter 
speak Seneca I see they look on you 
how do you like they 

royal Agrippina 
such and so good they be that able man 
may bold speak and not offend the truth 
nor you at all the style be full and princely 

stately and absolute beyond whatever 
these eye have see and Rome who majesty 
be there describe in after time shall owe 
for her memorial to your learned pen 
more than to all those fade monument 
build with the riches of the spoil world 
when rust shall eat her brass when time strong hand 
shall bruise to dust her marble palace 
triumphal arch pillar obelisk 
when Julius temple Claudius aqueduct 
Agrippa bath and Pompey theater 
nay Rome itself shall not be find at all 
historian book shall live those strong record 
those deathless monument alone shall show 
what and how great the roman empire be 

the act be noble not the present world 
alone shall owe to Agrippina worth 
as for her gracious government it do 
but future age shall acknowledge more 
to the rich labour of her royal pen 

the wise prince never seek to raise 
their present state alone but to preserve 
themselves immortal by a endless fame 
for memory of i beside these book 
if that our augur fail not in their skill 
or flatter not that German colony 
which I of late deduct over the Rhine 
to ubium for evermore the name 
of Agrippina colony shall bear 

that act though great declare your power alone 
your wealth and greatness but these learned book 
express your wisdom and for these you owe 
nothing at all to fortune 

thus I mean 
to spend all time which from affair of state 
and business of our empire can be spare 

be she already turn our emperor 

those wretch have too narrow soul who think 
that person great and eminent in state 
can spare no time to purchase same by writing 
but what they steal from action and employment 
as if no mind be large enough for both 
who be more full of action and more fit 
to rule nay rule the world than Julius Caesar 
yet he be of my mind 

o strange male spirit 
can there be find no other parallel 
but Julius Caesar to a woman mind 

yet Julius be too blame he toil too much 
to get his honour and too much debar 
his nature the free use of princely pleasure 
sure Lucius Sylla have a ample mind 
it be Sulla character that Sallust give he 
a free and great enjoyer of his pleasure 
yet how industrious his action speak 
he find fit time to rule the roman world 
and write both greek and latin commentary 

the soul of Sylla and of Caesar both 
I think have enter she 

well worthy friend 
you do approve my way of write then 

yes gracious madam and because you name 
great Julius to we I be think now 
that as in blood so in your style of write 
there be some nearness 

Seneca I thank you 
but I confess your positive approbation 
please i as well as that comparison 

do not your majesty esteem his book 

indifferent well a good loose careless way 
I think direct with Asinius Pollio 
have Caesar live he will have mend it 
the man have far more in he then that show 

yet under favour madam some have think 
those commentary hardly can be mend 
a style so strong naked and beautiful 
free from affect word and from all gloss 
or dress of oratory as in stead 
of lead other in a way to write 
it quite discourage the able man 
so Hirtius think and that fame Cicero 
the great master of Rome eloquence 

be those your author then that Hirtius 
be Caesar servant partial in his heart 
or else he flatter he for Cicero 
they be so far out of his tedious strain 
he can not censure they 

yet able man 
can true censure of another style 
then what themselves have use 

he be not able 
no not in oratory have I rule 
Rome and her senate then as now I do 
not all the oration that ever Cicero 
make in the senate shall have save one hair 
of a offendor or condemn a mouse 

how confident she be in censure 

I be amaze but let she have her way 
forgive my silence noble Cicero 
here thy defence be vain but what I spare 
the tongue of all posterity shall speak 

the tribune madam be return and bring 
Lollia Paulina head 

let he come in 

your pleasure great Augusta be perform 

let i peruse this face ha it be much change 
her tooth shall make i sure they do not grow Dio 
the common way I be confirm it be she 
reward he Pallas 

the god preserve 
Augusta Agrippina 

o pale death 
thou mock of beauty and of greatness too 
be this the face that once in Caesar love 
be Agrippina rival and dare hope 
as much against i as my unquestioned power 
have wrought on she be this that beauty once 
that wear the riches of the world about it 
for who attire all land all sea be search 
all creature robe This this be that Paulina 
who Cajus Caesar serve who Rome adore 
and the world fear 

such a sight methinks 
shall make she sad think of humane frailty 

take hence the head lest in her death she gain 
a great conquest over i than her life 
can ever do to make i shed a tear 
I will not wrong the justice I have do 
so much as to lament it now you know 
my friend she have a spirit dangerous 
and though my nature can have pardon she 
reason of state forbid it which then tell i 
great ruin have be wrought by foolish pity 

will she have such a nature but it be now 
too late to give her counsel 

so let all 
that dare contest with Agrippina fall enter servant 

Caesar be come to visit you 

now friend 
Vitellius Pollio Pallas second i 

how fare my Agrippina 

wondrous well 
when I be bless with Caesar company 

that shall be oft my love when Rome affair 
and public business will give i leave 

I will partake myself of those affair 
rather than want your presence 

I believe it 

thou shall it be only for thy dear sake 
I love my fortune thy sweet fellowship 
make light the burden of my government 

to ease great Caesar care shall ever be 
the height of my desire before you come 
my heart be sad I send for these my friend 
to impart the reason to they 

sad for what 

weigh the trouble of a princely state 
and all the danger that still threaten it 

danger 

Shee strike upon the fit string 
no passion reign in he so much as fear 

we be devise of the fit mean 
to give your state security you know 
your strong guard be the praetorian camp 

most true 

that camp command now by two 
may be by captain too ambitious strife 
divide into faction and so make 
less serviceable shall your safety need they 

Caesar remember when that bold attempt 
of Silius be how the praetorian camp 
be by their general strife in mutiny 
and have not one be choose for that day 
to rule they all Caesar have not be safe 

wise man in calm provide for storm to come 
none know how dangerous the time may prove 
though now the state be safe and may the god 
to Caesar honour long preserve it so 

what new design be this that all of they aside 
second so ready and I be not 
acquaint with it if it prove mischievous 
I thank the empress for my ignorance 

Burrhus Afranius be a worthy man 
fit for the place and faithful wellbeloved 
by all the soldier such a change my lord 
none can except against let he take all 

whatever her end may be this proposition 
for noble Burrhus sake I must approve 

it be true my love I make no question 
of Burrhus worth and fitness for the place 
but what offence have Geta and Crispinus 
be ever accuse of or what just suspicion 
be there of they 

I will not be unjust 
to accuse guiltless man although I price 
thy safety Caesar equal to my life 
I know no crime of note they have commit 

Caesar it be no loss to they at all 
they both have plenteous fortune to retire to 

and in so near a cause who dare examine 
great Caesar counsel or inquire the reason 

shall Burrhus have it Caesar speak thy pleasure 
or if my care offend I shall hereafter 
forbear to meddle 

no sweet Agrippina 
since thou will have it so go Pallas draw 
the warrant straight and seal it in our name 
let Geta and Crispinus be remove 
and Burrhus take possession present 
this day my love the Britain prisoner 
send from Ostorius Scapula and late 
arrive at Rome shall be in public show 
there thou shall see that brave barbarian prince 
that bold Caractacus who stubborn spirit 
so many year contemn the roman power 
he now be take 

it be a victory 
send from the god to honour Claudius reign 

have he be base take or at first 
yield himself as he have get no honour 
but be forget in his fall and nought 
have ever be mention of he but his death 
so have thy glory Caesar be far less 

not warlike Syphax the numidian king 
stubborn Jugurtha nor great Perseus 
ere bring to Rome by their captivity 
more real honour then this Britain prince 

nor do we price our name Britannicus 
fetch from that island less than Scipio 
his honour name of Africanus prize 

thy style oh Caesar be the great far 
draw from the conquest of another world 
which nature mean by interpose cold 
and stormy sea to guard from latian arm 

great Julius Caesar do but only show 
that land to we who conquest be reserve 
by heaven decree to honour Claudius name 

Caesar let we sit together one tribunal 
will hold we both 

it shall be so my love 
thou as myself shall pardon or condemn 

my love dear Otho fain will bid thou stay 
but danger now forbid it for my lord 
return by this time homeward from the palace 

we must obey the time necessity 
sweet Poppaea though I part from thou 
with such a sadness as will lose by all 
comparison and can be express 
but by itself to say that otho part 
from fair Poppaea be more tragical 
than soul from body honour from a man 

I can methinks flatter my fear to keep 
thou ever here 

and I can scorn all fear 
and danger too if thou command i stay 

no go my love and wary let we meet 
that we may often meet but why shall still 
our high bliss want freedom 

it be my fair one 
the envy of the god who think the state 
of man will equal they if great joy 
be easy to obtain and therefore still 
in horrid danger wrap their dear gift 
as all the poet ancient fable teach 
firebreathing bull do guard the colchian fleece 
a wake dragon keep the golden fruit 
but thou Poppaea in my thought a prize 
of great value and more lustre far 
then that which draw the bold thessalian forth 
so far from Greece or make Alcmena son 
invade the hesperide be keep from i 
by strong guard the awful roman law 
those law resist our love 

o where be Otho 
then when my virgin blossom be the hope 
of thousand noble youth have thou be see 
Poppaea bed and beauty have be thou 
and with a lawful uncontrolled flame 
have meet thy wish in those delight which now 
we be enforce to steal 

must it be so 
for ever then 

it must while Rufus live 

nor can I blame bless Rufus if he strive 
to keep that wealth which if it lay beyond 
the indian Ganges scythian Tanais 
or horn Ammon scorch and thirsty sand 
will draw the roman monarch to forsake 
his world imperial seat there to enjoy 
and think those banish that remain at Rome 
if I be Caesar and condemn by fate 
to want Poppaea love I shall be poor 
no other dear prerogative can that 
high wreath bestow but only power to make 
thou i without a rival I may then 
with boldness take thou from Crispinus arm 

but can that act be lawful 

can thou doubt it 
where two love meet can marriage be unlawful 
of which love be the soul the very form 
that give it be no dead outward ty 
but nature strong and inward sympathy 
can make a marriage which the god alone 
have power to breed in we and therefore they 
have only power to tie so sweet a knot 
I be thy mate nor do thy father when 
he give that snowy hand unto another 
ought but rebel against the god decree 

thou be to good a advocate and I 
too partial for a judge 

be constant to i 
till fortune give a bold privilege 
and warrant to our love of which I have 
receive such fair presage as I can 
despair meanwhile by stealth I must behold 
those starry eye and think myself most happy 
in that though no man know my happiness 

can man count those delight a happiness 
which they conceal 

yes those that true love enter Fulvia 

madam my lord be come 

farewell dear otho 

farewell love guard thou till we meet again exit 

Come Lucius study to forget it now 
and let we be true merry my Poppaea 
bid Lucius Geta welcome my colleague 
that be but still my friend 

you be most welcome 

thank fair lady 

but my lord what mean 
that speech of you that Lucius Geta once 
be your colleague and be not 

I tell thou 
great Agrippina have command Caesar 
to command Pallas to command we two 
To quit our charge and sudden resign 
the government of the praetorian camp 
〈◊〉 Burrhus hand at which he storm but I 
am merry far and light than before 
we may live free now Caesar have take 
〈◊〉 weighty burden from my weary neck 
Thank his goodness 

thank his sottishness 
it be that have pleasure you ah friend it needs 
must grieve all noble heart that can love justice 
and pity suffer innocence to see 
the harmless year of young Britannicus 
expose to all the malice of his foe 
and stupid Caesar make the instrument 
to ruin his own son while his great power 
by other be abuse against himself 
and his posterity 

I do believe it 

his servant all that to himself be true 
or faithful to his son be murder now 
or else displace by she our truth be the cause 
that we have lose our place 

it be no matter 
we lose no honour by our truth and since 
while we have power we faithful discharge 
our trust to Caesar let we not long strive 
to guard he against his will but take his gift 
he give we ease and freedom to retire 
and taste the sweet of privacy and there 
enjoy our life free from the glorious noise 
and trouble of a court instead of wait 
on Caesar now on thou I will bestow 
that time my fair Poppaea and attend 
on thy delight thou will not cast i off 
as Caesar do 

she can promise you 
I know her heart better than you in that 

none can describe the sweet of country life 
but those bless man that do enjoy and taste they 
plain husband man though far below our pitch 
of fortune place enjoy a wealth above we 
to who the earth with true and bounteous justice 
free from war care return a easy food 
they breathe the fresh and uncorrupted air 
and by clear brook enjoy untroubled sleep 
their state be fearless and secure enrich 
with several blessing such as great king 
may in true justice envy and themselves 
will count too happy if they true know they 

it be true Crispinus great monarch oft 
have in the midst of all their careful glory 
desire such life as those plain people lead 

let we enjoy that happiness than Lucius 
the country sport and recreation 
and friend as innocent as we with who 
we need not fear the strength of rich wine 
in draw out our secret but well fill 
at suppertime may hold a free discourse 
of Caesar weakness of the wealth and pride 
of his freedman how lordly Pallas rule 
how fierce and cruel Agrippina be 
what slave the roman senate be become 
and yet next morn awake with confidence 

all this my lord you may discourse at Rome 
if you can wise choose your company 

Well say Poppaea thou be a woman right 
thou love the city well 

I can blame she 
such beauty seek no corner but may well 
become the imperial city of the world 

Come Lucius Geta let we go in and laugh 
at our proud enemy enjoy their malice 
and drown our care in rich falernian wine 
as ancient as Opimius consulship 

here come a man Crispinus I believe 
be sorry for this change 

I think so Lucius 

Haile noble roman 

Haile to you Narcissus 
How dare you venture a salute on we 
or make a visit to such guilty man 

guilty my lord in what 

in be wrong 
those that be wrong in court be make offender 

I must confess my lord it be a wrong 
to you and your colleague to be displace 
but you have spirit great enough to scorn 
that injury and pity he that do it 
I mean that suffer his proud foe to do it 
rather against himself than you the wrong 
must fall on Caesar and his hapless house 
blind by fate and near his fall he throw 
away the best supporter of his state 

the thought of that as I be true Narcissus 
afflict i more than my own loss can do 

for i I think myself well free from trouble 
be it not for fear of poor Britannicus 

I do believe it noble lord but you 
be now discharge and may retire with safety 
my part be yet to play a part of danger 
and I will act it brave here I vow 
by all the god no fear shall make i shrink 
till I have once more right Claudius 
against the lust and treason of a wife 
nor do I boast of Messalina death 
it be the time necessity that make 
i then to show my power that power perchance 
be yet as much nor shall the lordly Pallas 
though swell with Agrippina lustful favour 
and back by her authority he think 
himself sole ruler in the imperial house 
find that Narcissus be so fall in spirit 
but that I dare attempt as much as then 
great Caesar safety be as much in danger 
as then it be his nuptial bed as stain 
and I will die or take the same revenge 
that then be take all their plot and treason 
will I reveal to Caesar and pursue it 
with such a dauntless constancy that if 
the god forget not to be just this day 
proud Agrippina and her minion fall 
the young Britannicus shall stand secure 
in his high birthright Messalina ghost 
shall then perchance although she hate i now 
forgive the hand that cause her overthrow 

brave resolve Narcissus 

you shall do 
a act that all good man shall thank you for 
will you go in and taste my wine 

not now 
I come but only to reveal my purpose 
to you who noble wish may befriend it 
and when occasion serve may true witness 
my just intent this hour I be expect 
by Caesar in his garden there I will put 
my life upon the hazard every minute 
may breed a change and all delay have danger 
for Caesar upon those discovery 
that I already have make to he utter 
some word last night at supper in his wine 
of which I fear that Agrippina take 
too great a notice therefore speed must help we 
farewell my lord 

farewell the god assist thou exeunt 

so rich a bondage be Poppaea love 
that I be base if I shall with for freedom 
nay more ingrate shall I desire to change 
so sweet a care for quietness itself 
shall I suppose that state which some dull soul 
call calm content be half so rich so free 
as be these pine this captivity 
be there in love no care no sigh no fear 
there be in love no happiness at all 
what bliss what wealth do ever the world bestow 
on man but care and fear attend it 
yet who so base as to be free from those 
will throw away the high bliss on earth 
let silly shepherd who poor narrow soul 
not much exceed the beast they tend and feed 
that know like they no far region 
than some few field no large bound of pleasure 
then satisfaction of bare nature needs 
be still secure since they have nought to lose 
and rest content because they never know 
what city be and gorgeous palace 
shall monarch who be teach to know the extent 
of nature wealth and what the world afford 
forgo their glorious fortune because they want 
that wretched thing which only ignorance 
and low contempt can give security 
shall I forgo my fair Poppaea love 
because some care some fear and sigh attend it 
when every smile of she can recompense 
a thousand such be too much poorness in i 
have I never see those starry eye of she 
more hapless far my ignorance have be 
I have like wretched man that be bear blind 
never know there be a sun to guild the world 
but to enjoy her love without all fear 
without all rival be a bliss beyond 
mortality the god will envy i 
she be now another man that may be think 
the great bar to Otho happiness 
but I have frame in my jealous thought 
a great bar then that young Nero Caesar 
in who acquaintance I of late have find 
so near a room as fair presage tell we 
be like to wear the imperial wreath he power 
may take she for i from Crispinus arm 
but then perchance I lose she more than ever 
or shall he see she now to rival i 
I be undo he be amorous and oft 
solicit i to let he see my mistress 
I for that friendship which I dare not lose 
dare not deny his importunity 
and therefore to prevent what may ensue 
for yet he never hear Poppaea name 
I have make love to the fair free woman 
young act of mean rank but such a face 
as whosoever have not see Poppaea 
will think this act nature masterpiece 
on she will I divert young Nero love 
and to that purpose I have get her picture 
but here he come enter Nero 

what Otho still retire 
where live the face that breed this melancholy 
there be no other cause can do it I know 
thou be not busy with affair of state 
I prithee let i see she a friend counsel 
may ease thy passion 

it be not fit a prince 
shall stoop so low as to the passion 
of private man 

the name of friend admit 
of no such distance 

sir no man who you 
be please to call a friend deserve that name 
unless he know himself to be your servant 

Come prithee leave thy fool and be plain 
where there be no familiarity 
society be lose why be thou fearful 
to let i see she whosoever she be 

Sr I can give you a plain common reason 
if she be foul she be not worth your sight 
if fair you be too great a rival for i 
but yet know sir I be so free from those 
unworthy fear that I dare trust my life 
my love and all I have into your hand 

speak like a friend and thou may safe do it 
then first behold her picture and by that 
find whether she be worth the sight or no 

can any mortal beauty be so sweet 

I will there be not 

sure the painter flatter 

o no he have not art enough to reach 
the glory of it be the substance here 
how dull will this now lovely table show 
see how his greedy eye devour the picture 
he be catch he be catch Cupid I thank thou now 

I never see true beauty till this hour 
but wherefore do thou wish there be no substance 
so sweet as this why will thou be deprive 
of such a happiness but I perceive 
it be thy fear come let it not be so 
I but desire to see whether the painter 
have err or no and do not think my Otho 
that I will wrong thy love so much or make 
my wife Octavia jealous 

sir however 
my life my love and fortune all be you exeunt 

your majesty may yet prevent it all 
and just throw upon the traitor head 
that ruin which so bold threaten you 
and your too much abuse family 
yet Caesar may be safe if he will use 
that power the god have put into his hand 

what course Narcissus can we run to make 
the people sensible of our estate 
what danger threaten we and how our justice 
be force to meet the treason of a wife 

let not too vain a care of popular breath 
or what the vulgar may surmise outweigh 
the safety of your person and your house 
but I be most assure that all the world 
except yourself have long observe their plot 
and if they see your waken justice now 
arise to censure Agrippina death 
they will not think the execution do 
too soon on she these humble knee o Caesar 
which for your safety I so oft have bow 
before the god now to your sacred self 
I bow entreat that you will be safe 
and not believe the god by miracle 
will work for you while you neglect yourself 

arise Narcissus it be the unhappy fate 
of prince ever as Augustus Caesar 
be wont to say the people never believe 
that treason be complot against their person 
until those treason take effect and then 
too late perchance they pity and believe 

but be the wise Augustus therefore slow 
or timorous to cut offender off 
fear he the people whisper Caesar no 
he well know to use the sword he have 
he have not else live till time gentle hand 
dissolve in peace his long felicity 
and make the world by such continuance 
of power believe he be a god on earth 

but some offender be too great to suffer 
the common course of justice against such 
wise prince have forbear to draw the sword 
and rather seek some way of policy 
how to ensnare they 

Caesar those be way 
as much unfit for prince as unsafe 
as many monarch have in dangerous time 
be ruine quite by go way too low 
though they have seem subtle as proud subject 
have be undo by play prince part 
and as this high and open way befit 
the power and person of earth great monarch 
so it befit the time necessity 
you have already Caesar show your sword 
and if you strike not now you do not right 
yourself at all but only arm your foe 
with plot of mischief to prevent their own 
and hasten on your quick destruction 
you have already threaten and those speech 
by Agrippina and her minion Pallas 
be overhear who like see snake will now 
bestir themselves in a more desperate fury 
I have already cast my own poor life 
into the utmost hazard but alas 
that be a thing not now considerable 
the god above can tell how willing 
for Caesar safety I will sacrifice 
this life make i the chief instrument 
impose what part of this exploit you please 
upon Narcissus hand and if I fail 
to execute I will not refuse to die 

o my Narcissus I have find thy faith 
in other service it be resolve 
their pride shall feel my justice thou shall see 
how soon I will secure myself and thou exeunt 

we be discover Pallas all our drift 
be sound by Narcissus and by he 
lay open to Caesar who dissemble yet 
the knowledge of it seek a sudden way 
to ruin both of we nor have we fear 
so soon as feel his fury have not wine 
betray his thought to we you know last night 
what speech Caesar in his drunkenness 
let fall before we and it be late tell i 
that meeting young Britannicus he weep 
confess that he have wrong he and there vow 
a quick redress what counsel shall we take 

we have no time for counsel but must act 
as soon as think we go not now to work 
but to prevent a mischief and our cure 
must be as strong and quick of operation 
as our disease be dangerous and sudden 
that bird that see the snare and will be catch 
deserve his death and since that Caesar know 
his purpose be discover as Narcissus 
have before this inform he that we hear it 
he will quick act what else he have defer 
no way be leave we but to meet the danger 
and for prevention first attempt to do 
that which we fear to suffer 

by what mean 
shall we procure his death for poison slow 
perchance may fail to lend a timely help 
unto our safety and too quick a venom 
may make the fact suspect 

shall the fact 
be never so much suspect your estate 
will be more safe than now it be but who 
will dare to utter it when Caesar dead 
and your own son the emperor for so 
my confidence assure i it will be 
therefore be speedy madam for your danger 
where fame where life and empire all be threaten 
give you no nice election so it be do 
no matter how 

thou have confirm i Pallas 
the way be resolve already there be late 
the fair mushroom send from Lybia 
that ere these eye behold a meat which he 
affect with greediness in one of those 
Caesar shall meet his death if that shall fail 
his chief physician Xenophon be i 
but be thing sting and ready to confirm 
the empire upon Nero 

it be the best 
and happy time before Britannicus 
be grow to ripe year while yet he wear 
his childish robe and Nero have be show 
to all the people in triumphal weed 
but when the deed be do place wary 
your guard about the palace gate and keep 
Britannicus within while Nero back 
by Seneca and Burrhus by the camp 
and senate be salute emperor 
and all be settle sure 

how fit a time 
to work his own destruction Caesar choose 
to tempt with threaten Agrippina fury 

be Nero fire 

extreme I at first 
seem melancholy to lose act so 
and he seem loath to wrong i but at last 
when his desire be high I cunning 
withdraw my interest and give way to he 
which he have take for the great favour 
that ever man can do he and I hope 
it have endear he strong 

thou will grow 
a happy man 

it be the best way to rise 
the wench be fair and of behaviour 
wanton enough to make the arrant novice 
a perfect scholar in the school of Venus 
Seneca himself rather will give way 
that he shall satisfy his lust on she 
then seek the adultery of noble woman 

but gentleman have you not hear the news 
there be a great combustion in the palace 
as I have be inform thief be fall out 
the two proud freeman Pallas and Narcissus 
be clash against each other 

I be glad on it 
I hope some curious roguery will come on it 
those be the fellow that have rule the state 
these many year and trample on the life 
of noble man Caesar credulous weakness 
but yet methinks Narcissus shall not dare 
now to contest with Pallas he have get 
too great a start of he and be too near 
acquaint with the empress 

so they say 

have a fine time on it who will think the rogue 
shall be so ambitious as to court a empress 

it be her ambition to be make the wife 
of Claudius that first make she prostitute 
herself so low and court this fellow love 
who she perceive to have a rule power 
over his dote master to ambition 
she sacrifice her honour it be well know 

and he by do of the empress take 
the sure way of keep Caesar love 

yes there be no doubt of that you know the proverb 

Well meet my lord I come to find you out 

what be the news Anicetus 

great my lord 
Caesar be wondrous sick it be think to death 
the Pallas be by soldier guard round 
a great and frequent senate be assemble 
the consul and the priest be make vow 
for Caesar safety 

Claudius be old 

there have be other way to end a prince 
beside old age but what be that to we 
come let we away and show our forwardness 
to joy or mourning as occasion serve 
I be prepare for both 

and so be I 

both must be do if Caesar die our grief 
must last but till the successor be know 
and than we must rejoice 

it be true 

but I 
shall have true cause of joy if Nero reign exeunt 

shall I not see my father ere he die 

good Xenophon 

good madam pardon i 
nothing be now so great a enemy 
to his disease as noise and company 
he be late fall into a gentle slumber 
deep sleep his fever will not let he take 
I will certify your highness when he wake 
and wait upon you 

thank good Xenophon exeunt 

I long to hear what favour Nero find 
in the praetorian camp how Caesar death 
be by the soldier and the senate take 
welcome my dear Pallas what be the news 

madam as good as Jove himself can send 
no soon in the camp be Caesar death 
divulge but Burrhus enter to his charge 
and Nero with he who by all the cohort 
be present salute emperor 
only some few be silent and a while 
stand still expect young Britannicus 
but when they see their expectation 
be all in vain and none but Nero come 
fear at last to lose the donative 
which Burrhus promise they in Nero name 
they join themselves unto the great part 

Britannicus within the palace here 
be safe enough for come forth today 
the senate have scarce hear of Caesar death 
for we conceal it till all thing be ready 

now in a princely chariot mount high 
guard by Burrhus and the soldier 
Nero set forward to the senate house 
but have pass the camp you need not fear 
the senate madam 

Pallas thou be ever 
a messenger of lucky news to i 
a safe contriver of the high plot 
a happy instrument thou have deserve 
whatever thou have enjoy though thou have taste 
that which a Caesar sue to taste and buy 
the world in recompense 
Pallas if ever Pallas 
have any fire that can advance his thought 
to high and great exploit he kindle it 
at your celestial beauty as from heaven 
Prometheus steal that active fire by which 
he dare himself adventure to create 
the noble creature man what act on earth 
what undertake shall he tremble at 
who Agrippina favour animate 
and what have I be but a piece of earth 
cold dull and useless have I not be quicken 
by your etherial touch Agrippina 
the happiness 
of this high day have make thou eloquent 

the love of royal Agrippina can 
inspire the dull soul with life and language 
when the idalian queen be please to grace 
a shepherd boy more than his humble thought 
can hope or wish the ravish tongue forget 
that rural language which before it use 

ah Pallas what a glorious change be here 
how be the lowness of our late despair 
turn to the height of joy and happiness 

quick resolution well pursue will cure 
the sad state 

go thou and hear more news 
while I dispose of thing about the palace exeunt 

may all the god accept our sacrifice 
and be propitious to the vow that we 
have vow for Caesar safety 

let the great 
divine and sacred Nero Claudius 
the care of heaven sole ruler of the earth 
and Rome high father not forsake his world 
so soon to increase the number of the god 

exile to the consul and this sacred senate 
great Claudius Caesar dead in who high throne 
with one consent the soldier have agree 
to seat young Nero his adopt son 
and do by i entreat your suffrage 
father conscript to ratify their choice 

let not young Nero year disparage he 
nor trouble you since happy precedent 
may well be show grave father great Augustus 
of glorious memory no more in debt 
to year than he begin to rule the state 
with what success not one in all this noble 
and great assembly can be ignorant 
but weigh with i the difference of the time 
the state be settle and have flourish long 
in peaceful government no civil rent 
no faction now nor army be a foot 
to stain with latian blood Philippi plain 
to die the arctic and sicilian sea 
and through all region bear the unnatural wound 
of bleed Rome no such affright name 
as Marcus Brutus Cassius Lepidus 
great Pompey son or fierce Antonius 
arm with the power of half the Roman world 
stand to oppose he o you god how great 
how many danger have beset the state 
when young Augustus manage it yet he 
withstand and vanquish all those difficulty 
and why shall Nero our elect prince 
age like Augustus not be able now 
to sway a peaceful sceptre for the right 
to this high wreath although Britannicus 
be bear the natural son of Claudius 
a prince of hope enough and may by some 
be think much wrong in this election 
yet weigh it right and no wrong be do 
for Nero be adopt but beside 
the claim of his adoption he be bear 
a true heir to our imperial house 
spring up from the loin of great Augustus Caesar 
Britannicus from Livia son alone 

nor be the year of young Britannicus 
so ripe as his to govern 

Seneca 
have wise show his undoubted right 
and I with joy approve the soldier choice 

the god preserve Nero our emperor 

now be the height of all my wish reach

or else deny the love he swear to i 
if ere he wear the world imperial wreath 
his power must fetch Poppaea from her husband 
nor be the deed so envious other prince 
have do the like and yet not tax in story 

beside he know Crispinus never love he 
and be a enemy to his adoption 
against he perchance he will the soon grant it 
Agrip this be the day that set a glorious crown 
on all my great design this day declare 
my power and make the tremble world to know 
that Agrippina only can bestow 
the roman empire and command the wheel 
of suffer fortune hold in her hand 
the fate of nation be there not a name 
above Augusta to inform the world 
how great I be what Roman deity 
shall I assume the petty goddess 
will all resign but that they blush think 
their style and altar be too mean for i 
●acinion Juno shall be proud to share 
her glory all with i and think her power 
grace with my fellowship will bright shine 
or leave her name and be adore by i 

my Nero be return hail Nero Caesar 

Haile great and dear Augusta best of mother 
to who sole care and goodness Caesar owe 
all those rich honour that he wear today 
and will acknowledge ever 

bright still 
for many year let this bless day return 
that do bestow for my dear lord and husband 
the never enough lament Claudius 
too true a solace on my grieve soul 
this be that Caesar now on who my hope 
and comfort all rely 

this be that Caesar 
who in obedience and true filial love 
to Agrippina will for ever strive 
with virtuous emulation to excel 
her most admire and exemplary goodness 

how well this piety become they both 

long live great Nero Caesar 

thank good Pallas 
we be indebt to thy faithful service 
and therefore till we find some great mean 
to make requital still retain that office 
which in our father Claudius time thou hold 
be still our steward of the imperial house 

he have deserve it 

for the funeral 
of our dead father in what state and order 
they shall be celebrate we refer 
to you dear mother 

let the order of they 
be like Augustus Caesar let he have 
a censor funeral with divine honour 
and put among the number of the god 
nor shall our grandmother great Livia 
with her Tiberius to Augustus show 
more piety or more magnificence 
than we to our divine Claudius exeunt 

if we be bind to think the god consider 
this humane world why be we not as well 
bind to believe the great member of it 
on who the fate of all the rest depend 
shall be their great care why shall the god 
extend their narrow providence and show 
their power in wood and rural village 
yet think the imperial family of Rome 
not worth their care at all for if they have 
where sleep their justice when great Claudius 
be murder by his servant and his wife 
and they adore and honour by the state 
for act that accurse deed what right 
can all the subject world receive from thence 
what good can dwell upon the earth with safety 
proud Pallas thou have get the victory 
over poor Narcissus and may safe triumph 
with thy false empress for no law can reach 
the height you soar at now but yet take heed 
that very crime the same impiety 
that aid you in your foul enterprise 
to vanquish i and justice on my side 
may one day pull you down 

Alas Narcissus 
too true Rufus thou and I foresee 
this fatal storm against Claudius woeful house 
Britannicus be now the object grow 
of all man pity 

in the wrong he do 
into his hopeful son he need must see 
his own destruction weave but if Claudius 
when I detect all their plot to he 
have be of nature quick and resolute 
he have prevent all and escape his murder 
it be certain he be poison 

Rome itself 
I fear will rue that sad adoption 
and in the wrong of young Britannicus 
will bear too deep a share while the fierce rule 
of Agrippina last 

what better hope 
do Nero promise we 
those that be near Xiphilin 
and inward with his nature do suspect 
in he all seed of vice and tyranny 
though smother for a time at least not hurtful 
while he refrain from meddle with the state 
that his night ramble revel drink feast 
and cruel sport that he be delight in 
be vice of his nature not his youth 

it be true Narcissus I of late have hear 
many begin to fear the prophecy 
of Aenobarbus his detest sire Xiphilin 
that nothing good can be beget betwixt he 
and Agrippina too too true alas 
such prophecy of some of our late prince 
have prove to Rome as that Augustus make 
of the slowjawed Tiberius and Tiberius 
of his successor Caius who he name 
a Phaeton to the unhappy world 

all that I hope for be a wretched life 
if that be not too much for i to hope 
into Campania will I go but there 
if death pursue i Caesar arm be long 
and I be arm for any accident 
let none but with a spirit prepare to die 
dare to adventure on prosperity 

Rufus and I be both resolve to leave 
the city too we be not safe within it 
but far perchance remove from her sight 
we may escape fell Agrippina spite 

ah Lucius Geta I be now enforce 
to that retirement which we late talk of 
because my danger move i not before 
fresh cause be give i now I will not breathe 
the air of Rome for all the wealth within it 

what cause be that Crispinus speak 

Poppaea 
that be my wife be carry from my house 
and divorce from i by command from Caesar 

the prince begin his reign most hopeful 

do you not wonder how I bear it thus 

I must confess the loss be wondrous great 

true have she be my chaste and faithful wife 
the loss have be beyond all estimation 
nor can a manly spirit have bear the wrong 
but she be none of i her heart my Lucius 
as I have since discover long ago 
be give to wanton Otho and with he 
it be thought she steal she close adulterous hour 
for on that Otho Nero have bestow she Xiphilin ex Dione 
want her heart that gawdy piece of earth 
that man call beauty I shall soon have scorn 
though Caesar warrant have not come at all 
shall we be go my friend 

with all my heart 
it be my fear Poppaea will have cause 
your stay too long 

I will put she from my thought 

farewell my lord all happiness attend 
your country life though I can hope for none 

farewell Narcissus may the god protect thou exeunt Otho 

thus great monarch oft have give away 
what they themselves never see nor ever know how 
to value true Nero have bestow 
a gift unknown on i which I that taste 
how sweet it be will not again forgo 
for all his empire wealth 

nor will I change 
my Otho love for great Augustus state 

there to enjoy where both extreme love 
be such a happiness as I have hear 
some do observe it seldom do befall 
a marry pair or if it do that bliss 
endure not long so envious be the fate 
but that be a dream my love I do not fear 

thou need not fear Poppaea constancy 
though Caesar be thy rival 

sweet I do not 
I dare not wrong thy truth or take so much 
from my own happiness as to suspect 
thy constant mind at all but Caesar power 
be of extent as large as man desire 
it be that that make thou i and nought but that 
that give can take my happiness away 
thou have a face Poppaea that will clear 
a ravisher from guilt that will excuse 
the treason of a friend and make my wrong 
no stain to Caesar be honour though the god 
or Cato be his judge 

Caesar will not 
he love thou well beside a noble mind 
will scorn to taste the fruit of force love 

a long besiege be as forcible 
as a assault and win the fort as sure 
though not so soon 

nay spare your argument 
I can look through they thou be fearful otho 
that I shall long to see the court alas 
I have no such ambition to be know 
to Agrippina or Octavia 

mistake i not sweet love I be so far 
from jealousy of thou that it be my purpose 
to make it my request that thou will go 
and see great Caesar court nor do I think 
Octavia will be jealous or that danger 
that once befall the fair Calphurnia 
who Agrippina banish Italy 
because that Claudius Caesar praise her beauty 
shall fall on thou 

it shall not fall on i 
I will no see the court fie Otho fie 
how wretched in strive to conceal 
thy jealousy thou do betray it to i 
why do thou tell i so of Caesar power 
Octavia wrath Calphunia banishment 
through Agrippina envy it be thy love 
better than all these subtle trick will keep 
my thought at home 

it shall appear to thou 
I do not fear at all or if I do 
it be not the fail of thy constancy 
enjoy what freedom thou desire Poppaea 
now for a little while excuse my absence 
I must forsake thou though unwilling 
Caesar I fear expect my return 
long before this love have beguile the time 
and make my stay seem short than it be 
but I shall think till I return again 
the hour be long till then farewell Poppaea Exit 

I find his fear already my estate 
be better far before Rufus Crispinus 
be grave and know not wantonness enough 
to make he jealous as this Otho do 
that too unlawful love which then I show 
to Otho be the mother of these fear 
be old Seleucus the magician come enter Fulvia 

madam he wait without 

go call he hither 
Seleucus be the master of his art 
all his prediction hitherto have prove 
most true and certain why shall I desire 
to know my future fate and hasten woe 
shall it prove ill before the time of woe 
but it be a longing that I can check enter Seleucus 
welcome Seleucus have you find it out 

madam your scheme be draw and there I find 
the star allot another husband to you 

another after otho 

yes a three 

what shall he be 

the great prince on earth 

ha Caesar 

yes it must be Caesar madam 
and it be as true as if the oracle 
of Jove and Phoebus have foretell it both 

This Caesar that now live 

I can no further 
instruct you madam what you hear be true 

drink this Seleucus for my sake farewell 
to be Augusta be the great gift 
the fate can give nor do it seem to i 
a thing so much unlikely Otho fear 
perchance be fatal if it be in vain 
his care will be nor can he then accuse 
i but the fate that overrule my love 

it be decree Silanus must not live 
the imperial blood that run within his vein 
be there no other cause be crime enough 
he be descend in the same degree 
that Nero be from great Augustus loin 
and some have late whisper that his age 
be more mature for sovereignty than Nero 
beside thou know his brother Lucius 
that shall have marry young Octavia 
by we be hunt to his death and he 
may meditate revenge 

you need not fear 
a spirit so sluggish as Silanus be 
your brother Caius Caesar in the midst 
of all his fear and jealousy to which 
he sacrifice so many noble branch 
of your imperial house contemn Silanus 
as one in who there be no spirit or danger 
and call he nothing but the golden beast 

we can tell if time of trouble come 
how much that beast by courage of attendant 
and confluence of soldier may be change 
he be proconsul now of Asia 
and may here after if the people shall 
malign our government bring power against we 

if you will have it so Publius celerius 
and Aelius now go for Asia 
have undertake there to poison he 

let it be do but Pallas first of all 
let a centurion be dispatch into 
Campania to kill Narcissus there Xiphilin 
he must not live that do contrive our ruin 
and know I fear the mean by which we escape it 
by our command it shall be warrant 
but tell i Pallas ere thou go be all 
the German soldier come 

madam they be 
you have a royal guard 

go dear Pallas 
dispatch celerius into Asia 
and the centurion to Campania Exit Pallas 
now Agrippina be herself and all 
the power and dignity she hold her own 
I do not owe it to a marriage bed 
or poor dependence on a husband love 
where every minion may have rival i 
there be no power no state at all but what 
be independent absolute and free 
beside my proper and peculiar guard 
two lictor by the senate be assign 
distinct from Caesar and the consul state 
to wait on i that all the world at last 
the imperial power may in a woman know 
I be a empress but never reign till now exit 

Come sit my friend they here be free welcome 
that bring free jovial heart far hence be all 
sad look sour gesture and censorious thought 
they fit not Nero table kiss i act 
and smile upon the feast 

Caesar command 
be warrant strong enough 

and thou shall find 
no rigid Cato here 

true great Caesar 
let such sour Scaurus sit at home and write 
against the pleasure of this happy age 
dull satyr such as water or the lees 
of tuscan wine beget let they admire 
those old penurious time when Curius feed 
on leek and onion when Fabritius 
feast the frugal senate with hang beef 
and rusty bacon and in earthen pot 
drink small etrurian wine let they be still 
such as themselves will make themselves unworthy 
to taste the plenty that Rome now enjoy 

why do our fame ancestor so far 
extend their conquer arm and strive to get 
the riches of the world but that their nephew 
may now enjoy they it be ingratitude 
to their rich labour shall we scorn to use 
what they have get or if the use of it 
in we be riot sure it be avarice 
in they that toil so much to purchase it 

which of those rigid censor that declaim 
against the vice of the time and tax 
Rome as luxurious now will call it virtue 
in a rich citizen who storehouse 
be fraught with the best provision his chest crowd 
his cellar full of rich campanian wine 
yet he himself to drink the course lees 
to feed on acorn pulse and crab to wrong 
his nature and defraud his genius 
it be say the fury keep pine Tantalus 
from taste those delicious fruit he see 
such will the Roman virtue be shall she 
affright her son the master of the world 
from taste that which they themselves possess 

it be true those former age be most frugal 
we thank they for it the better be our fare 
let those that list now when they have no need 
still imitate and boast their hungry virtue 
while we poor sinner be content with pheasant 
numidian hen and lybian purple wing 
wild goat boar hare thrush and mushroom 
oyster and mullet and such vicious meat 

fill i some wine Montanus melancholy 
and silent now 

Caesar I be but listen 
to hear Petronius good morality 

Otho I know can be melancholy 
he be a bridegroom and but new possess 
of that fair treasure he have court 
so long well Otho I must have a sight 
of fair Poppaea such I know she be 

Shee be unworthy of great Caesar sight 

a round go Anicetus bring the lot 
because that no respect of power shall let 
the freedom of our mirth whoever draw 
the long cut shall be our king tonight 
and be obey whatever he shall command 
I will resign my chair to he come draw enter Anicetus they draw 
it be I that be your king 

I shall believe 
that fortune have her eye 

in get crown 
Nero thy fortune be too good for i 

I know none envy i 

no envy can 
redress my wrong 
I will begin with Otho 
I do command thou send by Anicetus 
some trusty token that immediate 
may fetch Poppaea hither to the banquet 

it shall be do this ring will fetch she hither 
I ever though it will come to this 

thy plot 
of bring act in I see have fail 

I care not much he will at last have see she 

thou will not frown my act though thou see 
another beauty here 

no royal Caesar 
nor shall you hear i envious or detract 
although I know Poppaea be a lady 
who beauty do as far excel poor act 
as Cynthia do the lesser star or Venus 
the other seanymph 

free speak fair act 

here you shall find the saying do not hold 
that woman be detractor from each other 

mean time begin a health 

so please it Caesar 
to great Augusta Agrippina health 

let it go round and now Petronius 
I come to thou I do command thou write 
a satire present against those pleasure 
thou do so late praise against the attire 
and costly diet of this notorious age 
this be thy task 

I must obey the king 
and now be the fit time for such a satire 
I never find my virtue of that strength 
as to contemn good victual but upon 
a well fill stomach 

give he wine to heighten it 

I have write already a satiric poem 
in a grave angry way where I complain 
that Rome excess corruption luxury 
ruin the present government and betwixt 
Caesar and Pompey cause a civil war 
listen and hear my castigation 
now all the world victorious Rome have win 
all land all sea the morn and evening sun 
nor be content the ocean be furrow over 
with arm ship if any farhid shore 
Or land there be whence burnish gold be bring 
it be their foe by impious war they seek 
fate fit so for wealth old know delight 
they scorn and vulgar bareworn pleasure slight 
pearl in the assyrian lake the soldier love 
bright polish earth in hue with purple strive 
Numidia marble bring the scythian yield 
his early fleece the Arab spoil their field 
but see more ruin yet and great wound 
of injure peace the mauritanian ground 
and libyan Ammon far wood to get 
wild beast be search who tooth a price must set 
upon their death fierce tiger fetch from far 
and stalk stately on the theater 
be feed with humane slaughter to delight 
the people eye after the persian rite 
alas I shame to speak it and display 
the ruinthreatening fate they cut away 
manhood from growth spoil youth for venery 
soften their nature to keep back thereby 
in spite of time their age herself in kind 
abuse nature seek but can find 
they dote on catamite weak bend ham 
unnerve body and a thousand name 
of new attire loose hair of man in who

the wealth that all the spacious world contain 
by lawless arm the roam soldier gain 
their gluttony grow witty guilthead catch 
at sea alive be to their table bring 

no more my furious satirist thou have chide 
the time sufficient 

if you be please 
I have obey 

well I perceive Petronius 
a man may write a satire and yet be 
no Scaurus Curius or Fabritius 

a satirist shall be the contrary 
and know those vice which he mean to tax 

brother Britannicus thy task be next 
stand up and sing a song 

give i some time 
I can do it extempore what subject 

choose that yourself 

then give i leave to sing 
my own misfortune how I come to lose 
the roman sceptre 

how that will not fit 
a feast of mirth 

no let they laugh that win 

a good smart youth 

this must not be endure 
I must be free from this continual fear 
then be excuse be merry gentleman 
I wonder Anicetus stay so long 
but see they come be this Poppaea Otho 

it be she great Caesar 

wonder of her sex 
bright paragon of Rome all beauty yet 
that I have see have be but foil to set 
a great lustre on this star of light 

his eye be fix his change look do speak 
a depth of passion or my jealous fear 
dazzle my eye too much 

it be so she be lose 
if ever lady be a tennis ball 
it be this she be bandy so from one to other 

must then another reap the envy fruit 
of my injustice must Poppaea be 
my crime that take she from her other lord 
to be his pleasure 

be great Caesar sad 

no Otho still she show more fair and fair 
I can check my love sit fair lady 
and with your lustre grace our feast I see 
thou be a most incomparable judge 
in beauty otho and be I to choose 
a wife again I will trust no eye but thou 

will I may serve you Sr in any thing 

but tell i thy opinion in one question 
which do thou think the noble in a prince 
if he will use his power and do a act 
that may be think unjust to do it for friendship 
or satisfaction of his own delight 

Sr have you make the case a private man 
for the delight of prince as themselves 
we must count sacred I can soon resolve it 

let it be so for it be the same in justice 

I think it noble then to do it for friendship 
for friendship ever be hold honourable 
but satisfaction of our own delight 
a thing of weakness rather than of honour 

I see his drift 

Augustus Caesar then 
and I by power have do the self same act 
but in the cause I have excel Augustus 
for he to satisfy his own hot love 
from Claudius Nero take fair Livia 
I from Crispinus take a bright beauty 
to show myself no lover but a friend 
do not mistake i Otho and suppose 
I do repent the favour I have do 
I know it be well bestow 

it be such a favour 
that I confess great Caesar as no tongue 
can be enough expressive so it be hard 
to find a heart that be large enough to pay 
sufficient thanks in thought but pious man 
have still acknowledge that no thanks of we 
can equalise the bounty of the god 
and prince be like they shall I think less 
I shall both wrong the giver and the gift 

in value she aright thou show thyself 
as wise as just I wish thou joy of she 
but fair lady since it be so late 
before you grace our feast I can think 
that I have entertain you yet at all 
the scene shall therefore change another room 
shall bid Poppaea welcome to the court 

yet Caesar and his mother well agree 

the god continue it but Vitellius 
I fear the sequel Agrippina fierce 
and haughty disposition will too much 
provoke her son it be think and he too forward 
to throw all nature off 

I think so too 
and therefore I can wish that Agrippina 
will go a gentle way she must not build 
too much upon her merit though we know 
it be she that put the sceptre in his hand 
for vicious nature where they once begin 
to take distaste and purpose no requital 
the great debt they owe the more they hate 

beside she will find it hard far to work 
her end upon a son than it be to rule 
a dote husband 

time will show it all 
and we ere long shall know which way to lean 

will Agrippina sit today with Caesar 
on his tribunal to give audience 
to those armenian ambassador 

there be no doubt she will but I have spoil 
that state I hope for I have counsel Nero 
that if she come he shall arise and meet she 
as if he do it in respect and duty 
defer the audience of the ambassador 
I hope she will not understand our drift 

pray heaven she do not for you know her fierceness 

it will be Rome disgrace the senate shame 
and my great crime if the ambassador 
that come to plead their country cause at Rome 
shall see a woman perch up with Caesar 
into the chare to give they audience 
and sit command over the roman ensign 
it be not the custom of our ancestor 
to see such sight 

true Lucius Seneca 
our ancestor have no such kind of woman 
she in her heart be a man and you mistake 
if you esteem she only Caesar mother 
not his colleague and partner in the empire 
or more than so 

I be not so ingrateful 
to hate the woman since I know it be 
her favour that repeal my banishment 
but I dislike these thing that foreign state 
in her unseemly carriage shall behold Xiphilin 
the shame of Rome and will she keep a temper 
fit the quality of her sex and place 
I shall admire the bravery of her mind 

long live great Nero Caesar the chief care 
of heaven and high sovereign of the earth 
the prince of Armenia Vologese 
and Tiridates greet your majesty 
by we and do congratulate the honour 
which since divine Claudius leave the earth 
to make a god in heaven be fall on you 
and to your high tribunal do refer 
the controversy that be now betwixt they 

my mother be come defer the embassador 
as it be appoint Seneca 

I will 

hail dear mother 

wherefore rise Caesar 
from his tribunal when affair of state 
be bring before he 

no respect can be 
too much for i to give great Agrippina 

excuse i Caesar if it be respect 
it be now unseasonable take your seat 
I will fit with you myself and here the affair 
of these armenian ambassador 

we have defer the business a while 
and think upon a fit time to hear it 

if you arise because the audience 
be end or defer upon just reason 
it be not respect to i that make you rise 
as you allege at first but I have find it 
the reason that defer this audience 
be Agrippina come 

this I fear 

it be carry ill of Caesar at the first 

I see thou blush Nero and may just 
to call that reverence which be affront 
be a dissemble not befit Caesar 
and to affront a mother so deserve 
be not the duty that befit Nero 

can near Agrippina think she Nero 
will ever do a act that may be judge 
affront to she 

this be thou know it Nero 
and so do thy adviser Seneca 
from he it come no other senator 
dare to have counsel my disgrace but he 

never will Seneca so much oblige 
to Agrippina royal favour wish 
or council her disgrace 

o Seneca 
philosophy never teach ingratitude 
if you have think the place unfit for i 
you may have tell i private before 
not use this trick which howsoever it hold 
in stoicism I be sure be nought in state 

Shee pay he home 

her spirit can brook 
the least appearance of a injury 

Caesar I will leave thou now nor shall my presence 
be any hindrance to thy state affair 

I will go along with you 

for Seneca 
I will short teach he new philosophy 

she be full of anger but it move not i 
since what I do be just and for the honour 
of Rome and Caesar honest action 
will be enough protection to themselves 

take the best course to prevent her fury 

ah noble Burrhus it must be hereafter 
our great care to curb that woman pride 
and what we can remove she from all rule 
and government of state for Agrippina 
be of too hot and fierce a disposition 

what shall we do it be pity to incense 
her son against she 

the god forbid that we 
shall strive to make the prince unnatural 
but to prevent this inconvenience 
I will persuade young Caesar not with purpose 
to wrong his mother somewhat to abate 
her dangerous greatness to remove from her 
part of her guard of German soldier 
and to displace her wicked counsellor 
that insolent and lordly freedman Pallas 

you need not use persuasion to your pupil 
the god forgive it if I judge amiss 
to stand against his mother I much fear 
he will too quick hate she for no reason 
to state belong but because she grow 
imperious over he and strive to curb 
his lust and riot those those Seneca 
I fear be seed of future tyranny 
and for his love as if the fate decree 
to make his passion all preposterous 
his virtuous wife noble Octavia 
the only instance in this wicked age 
of woman great and good be loathe by he 

that most afflict i can we find a cure 
for that disease all other malady 
a ripe age will in some part redress 
and I will strive to change they by degree 
and get he to forsake his loose associate 
but let we first endeavour to remove 
fierce Agrippina from all rule of state 

I will join with you and use my best endeavour 

shall I that be a emperor be check 
control and baffle in my palace thus 
I will remove this mother far from i 
and give command to Burrhus to provide 
that house that be Antonia for she 
the palace shall be free to my delight 
I make no doubt but that the people know 
and hate her pride and will the less repine 
at what I do against she I have tell she 
for she provoke i past all patience 
part of my mind already she shall rue 
perchance too late the fierceness she have show 

ingrateful Nero be thy mother power 
so soon offensive grow can thou so soon 
cast off all filial duty and forget 
what I deserve from thou will thou deprive 
i of all power that give all power to thou 
do I so wicked for thou procure 
the height of human state that thou shall take 
all state from i with great wickedness 
o wrong Claudius this sad punishment 
my bloody treason and ingratitude 
to thy offend mane just pay 
by the most love and most injure lord 
the worst of wife be more belove than now 
the best of mother by a wicked son 
I will make he know what hand it be that raise 
his fortune to this height but wherefore weep 
my dear Octavia 

what accurse fate 
pursue the woeful claudian family 

dear daughter speak thy grief 

be I bestow 
or rather lose in marriage to advance 
upon my brother ruin Nero state 
to be by he despise hate and make 
a base freedwoman slave 

what free woman 

act thy Nero concubine my mistress 
that dare within the palace to contest 
nay to revile Octavia 

she dare not 
nor shall she do it I will slit the strumpet nose 
if she dare speak against thou 

you can mother 
Nero delight in none but she his soul 
in act live on she he do bestow 
that love that be due to i but i he loathe 
o dismal love o fatal marriage 

take comfort sweet Octavia I will redress 
thy wrong or venture my own fall with thou 

you have complain I see Octavia 
be there a chide towards 

have thy guilt 
and the unkind wrong thou have already do 
unthankful Nero to thy virtuous wife 
arm thou with such a impudence that now 
thou can prevent she just accuse thus 

how be this 

methinks although thou have no spark 
of goodness leave thou yet in policy 
thou shall not dare maintain a base bear strumpet 
against thy lawful wife great Claudius daughter 

methinks in policy you may remember 
you speak to Caesar not a child 

it be true 
thou have forget the duty of a child 

I will be better know if I be cross 
in my delight I will be bold to cross 
you in your pleasure too 

o heaven what pleasure 
what joy or study have I ever have 
but to prefer thou Nero be my care 
and all my labour thus requite now 
let not too vain and foolish confidence 
of what thou be make thou presume to wrong 
thy mother and thy wife or thou shall know 
the empire lawful heir be yet alive 
the wrong Britannicus be grow up 
to take his right and to revenge the wrong 
which he and all his family sustain Xiphilin 
I will go myself to the praetorian camp 
and plead his cause before the soldier 
there let onehanded Burrhus and that base 
unthankful exile Seneca appear 
against the daughter of Germanicus 

yes plead the cause of young Britannicus 
and when you have do provide a advocate 
to plead your own 

go so abrupt from we 
slight he my anger so 

madam I fear 
you take too harsh a way his look be wild 
and full of rage my sad misgive soul 
tell i some mischief be work in his thought 

fear not Octavia we will take the best 
and sure course to prevent the ill 
that may ensue and if mature advice 
and council can bridle he we will use 
another mean to curb his insolence 
I have already by my bounty make 
most of the tribune and centurion 
my guard be strong and shall be vigilant 
over the safety of Britannicus 
as my own person there be no open act 
of mischief can be on the sudden wrought 

the god I hope will guard our innocence 

my fear have be too slow and it be high time 
that Agrippina thunder threat have wake 
my sleep mischief which shall now no more 
study disguise but appear in bold 
and open act with Caesar stamp upon they 
fearless of vulgar whisper jealousy 
upon thy death Britannicus a price 
no less than Rome imperial wreath be set 
the deed when do will privilege itself 
and make the power of Nero strong enough 
to warrant his misdeed who dare revenge 
or blame the offence that free i from a rival 
but I shall leave a worse and near far 
behind my mother Agrippina live 
she live my rival nay my partner still 
nay more than that my queen and governess 
I be no prince no man nothing at all 
while Agrippina live must 〈◊〉 then live 
to make i nothing must the name of mother 
outweigh a sceptre can the name of husband 
protect she Claudius no her own example 
shall teach i state but first Britannicus 
must be remove his death assure my state 
and make i able to contest with she 
that gentle poison which Locusta give he 
if poison it be while we do vain fear 
the people talk have keep my fear alive 
where be this hag 

Caesar 

witch beat she 
fiend fury devil 

mercy mercy Caesar 

I will hew thy curse carcase into atom 
thou give Britannicus a antidote 
in stead of poison 

it be a gentle poison 
and such as you command i to make 
hold Caesar hold I will redeem all yet 

do it or die make i a poison strong 
a quick and speed one 

it shall be do 
no soon taste but it shall destroy 

I will see the trial of it and reward 
thy service well but if Britannicus 
out live this day this day shall be thy last 

it be the will of Caesar soldier 
you must be all discharge from guard she 
but you shall have allowance and thus much 
I will promise for your comfort you shall be 
the next that be ascribe into the list 
of the praetorian camp 

thank noble Burrhus 

go Anicetus give command that straight 
that house which be Antonia be prepare 
for Agrippina and her family 
Caesar will have the palace to himself 

do Agrippina know it 

not yet I think 
be there displeasure then betwixt she and Caesar 

I know not you will excuse my haste my lord 
I must take leave 

I like not these new turn 
I come to visit she but now I will spare 
my hail this morn whither so fast my lord 

to visit Agrippina 

stay I will tell you 
there be some difference betwixt she and Caesar 
her guard be take away I part now 
from Burrhus who discharge they she herself 
shall be remove from the imperial palace 

I like not that I will spare my visit then 

Otho will lose his wife then 

yes no doubt 
and I believe must leave the city too 
Nero extreme fire and he will have she 
alone poor Otho must not rival Caesar 
nor indeed be it fit that the husband 
shall make the adulterer a cuckold 

do thou believe Petronius that this change 
please Poppaea 

yes I warrant she 
Shee think her beauty never can have do she 
a great service 

but she seem to love 
Otho extreme 

I confess Montanus 
I think her appetite stand well to Otho 
for it be a rascal of a win carriage 
and curious feature but she have enjoy he 
sometime already and that passion 
which you call love do move in a degree 
so low and feeble it be soon swallow up 
in the deep torrent of ambition 
Poppaea proud nor can that breast of she 
harbour a love so strong but it must yield 
to pride her quality predominant 

what can she be but Nero concubine 
I see not what high honour lie in that 

you can tell what she may be in time 

she can be Augusta that high name 
Octavia while she live will keep he dare not 
forsake that wife however he do affect she 
to who he may be say to owe the empire 

for my own part I know not how it will go 
but I dare swear Poppaea ere this time 
have ask and hear what the chaldaean say 
about her fortune our fine dame of Rome 
must still be tamper with that kind of cattle 
their dog their monkey and themselves do nothing 
without the advice of such a cunning man 
have thou see Otho late 

yes today 

how do he look upon the business 

faith somewhat sad but Caesar seem to use he 
so wonderful kind that he can think 
he be wrong at all 

prithee let we find he out exeunt 

no long steward of the imperial house 
be great benefit so soon forget 
by wicked prince it be and ever be 
the fate of court monarch unjust hate 
acknowledgement what power what honour now 
do Nero hold but what he owe to i 
my merit nay my wickedness which do 
to he increase the merit for this heart 
have bleed the more for my ingratitude 
to my best master Claudius his sad wrong 
another now revenge o Narcissus 
perchance the conquest that I get over thou 
when we two strive about the successor 
to Claudius Caesar will hereafter prove 
more fatal to the conqueror then he 
that lose the day thou in Campania 
die happy though hunt to thy death 
by we and carry to thy grave the honour 
of aid the just side o royal empress 
I fear our care to raise unthankful Nero 
will prove at last our own destruction 
my place loss I weigh not but for fear 
it prove a step to your dishonour madam 

it be for my sake that thou have lose it Pallas 
with i my friend be hate o sad fate 
that follow impious action well perchance 
and happy may I have live if wrong 
Britannicus have reign o will the loss 
of this unworthy life can yet procure 
that injure prince his due 

can fortune turn 
the course of thing so strange that you madam 
the prince his mother and his raiser too 
shall wish the other reign 

it can it can 
this be the power and justice of the god 
that when we think ourselves most safe in ill 
can frustrate all our confidence and make 
that power which seem to be our prop to be 
our only cause of ruin we be child 
vice make we child like to they we cry 
for knife to hurt ourselves with and the god 
to punish we oft grant what we desire 

what doleful noise be this 

ay i I fear 

o dismal day o wretched family 
fly back bright Phoebus to the eastern shore 
or hide thy head thou have at Rome behold 
a feast more black then ere Mycenae see 
Oh dear brother sweet Britannicus 

Britannicus 

murder Britannicus 
poison at Nero table 

break my heart 
the great woe that can befall be come

on i o glorious name of banishment 
yet welcome now since fair Poppaea lose 
I thank thou Nero thou provide a brave 
and honourable cure for that sad wound 
thou have inflict on my lovesick soul 
how great a torture have it be to i 
to live in Rome divorce from she and see 
that beauty fold in another arm 
hence wanton thought fond love for ever vanish 
collect my soul whatever thou have within thou 
of Roman leave and answer to the call 
bright honour make some favourable God 
pity the lust and riot of a youth 
so much mislead have send this seem loss 
to wake i from so base a lethargy

free from the infectious vice of this court 
and far from see the abhor effect 
of future tyranny which needs must break 
from Nero vicious nature at my birth 
the augur promise high and glorious hope 
this be the way to bring they Spain shall find 
another Otho then be send from Rome 
Poppaea promise here to meet and take 
her last leave of i why shall I again 
renew my passion by the sight of she 
but it be but one poor look and so farewell 

Haile Marcus Otho emperor of Rome 
Caesar that shall be 

ha 

it be thy fate 
which shall not be prevent 

tell i father 
for your prediction ever have be true 
shall I behold Poppaea face again 
when I have leave the city 

never more Exit Seleucus 

never a heavy doom yet I in lieu 
of she shall gain the empire of the world 
Juno will heal the wound that Venus give 
see there she come her beauty wax still 
or else the sad conceit of never more 
see that face make it appear more fair 
how dull the edge of honour grow already 
here can I stay and like the trojan prince 
lock in fair Dido arm forget forever 
the italian land and all my future fame 
he Jove admonish to depart from thence 
i the command of Caesar force hence 
and leave no power in my election 
farewell Poppaea 

o hard fate in love 
be i who joy be never last yet 
speak not so soon that kill word farewell 

what gain alas can one small minute be 
or if it be gain to i to the Poppaea 
it be loss to keep thou from thy Caesar sight 
he be thy servant who the world obey 

ah Otho love can witness that this fortune 
be never seek by i 

thou be too great 
a treasure for a private man to keep 
no live still happy with thy Caesar here 
and grant i one request if of that love 
which once we vow so dear there yet remain 
so small a part as may deserve the name 
of common friendship use thy power with Caesar 
my government may be continue long 

rather let i entreat the contrary 
and keep thou hereat Rome 

it must not be 
never while Nero live and live with thou 
it must be love no more but friendship now 
betwixt we Poppaea which may still be keep 
in absence by good wish and without 
those near comfort which fond love require 
but who shall teach i to forget that sweet 
delicious lesson which love school do teach 
when thy admire beauty be the book 
and I a scholar too too forward then 
o will great Caesar power to cure my wound 
can but bestow so privative a good 
as loss of memory but that alas 
be too unjust a cure and I can wish 
rather to suffer still then quite forget 
that I be once Poppaea envy love 
I will rather strive to solace my sick soul 
with contemplation of past happiness 
and by recount over our former joy 
deceive those hour of sorrow I must pass 

and I for comfort of our absent love 
will cherish hope that we shall meet again 

no think i dead bright love and I will enforce 
my imagination to believe that thou 
translate by some amorous deity 
have leave the earth to beautify the sky 
and turn astronomer in love to find 
thy figure out among those radiant light 
which Jove transform paramour have make 
amongst those I will seek for fair Poppaea star 
and swear I see it rather than believe 
thou live on earth debar from Otho sight 
I must begin to part I see for thou 
in modesty be loath to chide i hence 
and bid i quit the place farewell Poppaea 
such height of happiness may thou enjoy 
as Caesar constant love can bring to thou 

as much good fortune follow otho still 
it be power that part we all the god can tell exit otho 
how well I love thou Otho but those god 
that have ordain another fate for i 
must be obey yet Nero must be wrought 
with cunning to my end or else my fortune 
be low and poor my title nought at all 
it be not the love of Caesar but the honour 
and that high title which attend his love 
that be Poppaea aim Octavia 
debar i yet from that and Agrippina 
be fierce and keep her son in pupillage 

now fair Poppaea thou be my alone 
Otho be remove embrace the happy change 
that fortune bring thou thou have find instead 
of he a Caesar who beside his state 
have bring a heart as true to thou and love 
as strong and fervent as poor Otho be 
thou be before a diamond coarse set 
a cloud star the fate do pity thou 
and will no long let that beauty lie 
eclipse in a private family 
no seat but Rome imperial throne no sphere 
but Caesar arm be fit for these bright eye 
to shine in and the subject world to adore 
their lustre like some constellation 
new rise to amaze mortality 
not Rome alone but all the far shore 
that Peleus silverfooted wife ere know 
shall call Poppaea mistress 

those be honour 
Caesar too high too great for i to hope 

to hope my love they be thy own already 

Caesar thou know it can be and I 
that may have live content with Otho love 
and there enjoy the honour name of wife 
must in the palace find a base style 

thou wrong my power Poppaea if thou think 
I can give the high style to thou 
and if thou think I mean it not thou wrong 
my true love 

Octavia be alive 
no love of thou can bear Augustus state 
but only she 

she shall be soon remove 
to make a room for fair Poppaea honour 
nor will the senate dare to grumble at it 

though all be silent else fierce Agrippina Xiphilin 
will in that act control thou and think i 
to mean for Caesar wife though I be spring 
for I may speak a truth that Rome can witness 
from noble and triumphant ancestor 

there love thou strike upon the true string 
that Agrippina be my great fear 
though now she be not for I will tell it thou 
if Anicetus stratagem have take 
ere this she wander on the stygian shore 
weary I be of her imperious pride 
and fear her cruel plot How that succeed 
be now my great expectation 
nor do I live till Anicetus come 
and bring my safety in that woman death 

see Anicetus be return 

speak man 
what be my fate thou carry in thy voice 
the life and death of Caesar 

your command 
be do great Caesar but your mother escape 

escape how can it be but you be false 
and all conspire together to betray Xiphilin 
my life in save she how can she escape 

we choose the night to act it in but night 
prove not so black as night the star give light 
no wind at all blue as we launch forth Xiphilin 
down in the galley Agrippina lie 
and at her foot lie Aceronia 
with joy discourse of your courtesy 
and favour late show she but when I 
the watchword give the cover of the place 
load with lead fall down and press to death 
her servant Gallus but when the other part 
by fortune strong break not nor the vessel 
be lose asunder all be in amaze 
the rower straightway think it best to weigh 
the galley at one side and sink she so 
there Aceronia float in the wave 
feign herself to be the empress cry 
help help the prince his mother but the rower 
with pole and oar straight kill she as she swim 
but Agrippina in a silence cause 
by policy or fear swim to the bank 
have receive but one wound and there 
succour by little bark through Lucrine lake 
to her own house be carry at the last 

o I be lose and dead I shall be straight 
surprise and kill she will arm her slave and stir 
the soldier up or to the senate house 
complain and show the wound she have receive 
and tell the story there what shall I do 
advise i my Poppaea Anicetus 
but yet advise i nothing but her death 
no other course be safe Nero must die 
if Agrippina live call Burrhus to i 
send forth the soldier to dispatch she straight 

it be no action for a soldier hand 
nor will the camp for brave Germanicus 
her father sake be draw to butcher she 
let Anicetus finish the exploit 
he have begin 

it must be so go on 
with thy religious act good Anicetus 
thou be oblige to finish it or else 
what thou have do already will procure 
my ruin rather than security 
choose thou what aid thou will 

I have they ready 
fear it not Caesar Agrippina dead 

o comfortable voice thou be the man 
thou only Anicetus that bestow 
the empire upon Nero to thy gift 
I will acknowledge it and celebrate 
this as my day of coronation 
what plot shall we invent to hide the deed 
and put the intent of murder upon she 
to bring you news of her escape I will find 
a way to do it it be strange none yet come from she 
see Agerinus come enter Agerinus 

all health to Caesar 
Augusta by the favour of the god 
have late escape a strange and wonderful 
danger at sea 

Caesar when any of her servant come 
what mean this poniard Anicetus let fall a poniard behind Agerinus 
in Caesar presence Agerinus 

treason Ziphilin 
Shee send to murder i drag hence the slave 
and torture he to death 

I be as free 
from guilt in this as innocence itself 

hence with the villain to his death and thou 
dear Anicetus forward with thy plot exeunt 

leave i alone but be not far from i exeunt 
who will rely upon the gratitude 
of man or trust the fruit of benefit 
that now behold or shall hereafter read 
my woeful fortune ay that have bestow 
whatever the world contain to be possess 
by impious Nero in reward expect 
nothing but bloody death it be too too true 
that strange deceitful galley be a plot 
a impious engine make to murder i 
as by the fierceness of the slave my wound 
and Aceronia death it do appear 
can I expect that Nero shall relent 
or that the tyrant in a brother blood 
imbrue already shall not rather think 
no mischief can be safe till full do 
o have his thought be good have my escape 
be grateful to he all the house ere this 
with visitant and client have be fill 
to ask and see how Caesar mother do 
where now be all the hail the bend knee 
low prostrate face and officious tongue 
that strive in honour Agrippina name 
vanish alas and nought but solitude 
illboding silence and neglect remain 
in this forsake palace but too soon 
ay i I fear the approach of villainy 
what noise be that at door where be my servant 
Mnester Seleucus Galla Xenophon 
no answer make be they depart too 
then vanish all my hope false world farewell 
with all thy fade glory but alas 
whither from hence shall Agrippina fly 
what region be there in the other world 
but my injustice have already fill 
with wrong ghost there young Silanus wander 
Lollia Paulina and great Claudius 
my murder lord yet those sad spirit perchance 
abhor Nero base ingratitude 
and glut with revenge will cease to hate 
at last and pity Agrippina state 
ay i be Anicetus come again 
then I be dead past hope murder help help Xiphilin 

you guess our business right but it be in vain 
to call for help your guard be far enough 

o hold your hand a while hear i but speak 
consider with yourselves before you act 
a deed so execrable as will stick 
a last brand on your abhor name 
this murder will be famous through the world 
all man will fly your hate company 
like bird of night shall you for ever hide 
your guilty head or which be worse than that 
Nero himself who do command the deed 
as you pretend shall guerdon you with death 
and quit himself by punish of you 
o rather venture Nero frown and keep 
your innocence 

can they be innocent 
that disobey their prince his will 

but sure 
you do mistake the prince I be his mother 
it be I that give he birth nay more that put 
into his hand the sceptre of the world 
can he command my death 

we do not stand 
examine the cause 

then strike this womb 
this tragical and ever curse womb 
that to the ruin of mankind bring forth Xiphilin 
that monster Nero here here take revenge 
here justice bid you strike let these sad wound 
serve to appease the hatred of the earth 
against Agrippina for dire Nero birth
