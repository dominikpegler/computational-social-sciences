and with a cup or two of merrygodown 
make they shake hand be it not well say m Deane 

and I can wish it as well do m Hobson 

I will have you both know though you be my friend 
I scorn my cause shall stoop or you will to he 
although he be repute Ramsey the rich 

and Gresham shall perceive that Ramsey purse 
shall make he spend the wealth of Osterley 
but he shall know 

know what shall I know 

that Ramsey be as good a man as Gresham

tut tut tut Gresham tut in thy tooth although thou be 

Bones a i you be both to blame a knight 
we two like friend come to conclude your strife 
and you like fishwife fall a scold here 

how stand the difference betwixt you my good friend 

the impatience both of the one and other 
will not permit to hear each other speak 
I will tell the cause for both and thus it be 
there be a lordship call Osterley 
that m Gresham have both buy and build upon 

and it be a goodly manor m Deane 

which Osterley before he deal therein 
sir Thomas my husband here do think to buy 
and have give earnest for it 

then Gresham here deal with the landseller 
and buy my bargain most dishonest 

God for his mercy touch my honesty 
away with compromise with take up 
the law shall try my cause and honesty 

it will prove no better than it shall Gresham 

it will prove as good as Ramsey Ramsey 

do not I know thy rise 

ay and I know thou 

why i be honest 

and so be i 

Hey day bone a i 
be it ever see two man to scold before 
here be I know thy rise and I know thou 
whenas God blessing that have raise they both 
be I worse because in Edward day 
when popery go down I do engross 
most of the bead that be within the kingdom 
that when queen marie have renew that church 
they that will pray on bead be force to i 
I make they stretch their pursestring grow rich thereby 
bead be to i a good commodity 

no matter for your bead my right be my right 

yet Gresham shall well know he have do i wrong 

there be law enough to right you take your course 

reason be make man guide why be it that force 
be violent passion to sweep the soul 
into such headlong mischief it be only this 
reason will rule nature a rebel be 
you know the fire of your contention 
have only cherish and be maintain 
from vild affection who strength be but th●● 
as sultry heat do make we shun the fire 
a extreme cold do alter that desire 
all thing that have beginning have their end 
your hate must have conclusion then be friend 

friend m doctor Nowell look you here 
here be m Gresham hand 

I will bring the other 

this seven year they have be in law together 
how much such man as they in seven year spend 
lawyer may laugh at but let wise man judge 

friend Hobson 

wife lady 

Bones a i I will hold you fast 
I will not have a couple of such man 
make cackle lawyer rich and themselves fool 
and for a trifle cause as I be old Hobson 

sir Thomas Ramsey 

master Gresham 

body of i both shall be school m D Nowell 
you know the cause that this contention 
be only that he buy a piece of land 
this have give earnest for all Adam earth 
and Adam earth be free for Adam son 
and it be a shame man shall contend for it 
whatever you speak shall for a sentence stand 
and be speak they shall shake hand in hand 

if I must then decide the difference 
thus it shall be because that sir Thomas Ramsey 
have earnest give before you buy the land 
though you be not acquaint with so much 
I do award he have a hundred pound 
towards his charge and for that you 
have both pay for the land and build upon it 
it shall continue you the money you have spend 
either account it lose or bad lend 

God precious I have spend five hundred pound 

and so have I 

no matter 
the judgement stand only this verdict too 
have you before the law foresee the loss 
you have not now come home by weep cross 
strife may as well have end betwixt honest man 
lawyer set fool to law then laugh at they 

fore God it be true and now I think upon it 
we may at first have end it by friend 
and make ourselves merry with the money 
but be do it be do than sir Thomas Ramsey 
let we leave both loser it be but a thousand pound 
and if you be as well content as I 
here we will shake hand and let our anger die 

shake hand by the marie god sir Thomas what else 

you show yourselves our friend to make we friend 
then in good sooth I will not be obstinate 

nay m doctor Nowell join their hand 
I know the reverent regard of you 
have temper both their heart 

madam it be true I think to any but so good a man 
we shall have both be headstrong but come 

with all my heart long may you live together 
as friend shall be to friend brother to brother 

amen amen sir Thomas 

amen amen master Gresham 

amen amen to you both 
and be not it be better than every term to trot after lawyer 

good sooth it be true if we can think it so 
but it be man nature he desire his woe 
now passion of i sir Thomas a cruel storm 
and we stay long we shall be wet to the skin 
I do not like nay and it anger i 
that such a famous city as this be 
wherein so many gallant merchant be 
have not a place to meet in but in this 
where every shower of rain must trouble they 
I can tell but if I live let we step into the pope head 
we shall be drop dry if stay here 
I will have a roof build and such a roof 
that merchant and their wife friend and their friend 
shall walk underneath it as now in Paul
