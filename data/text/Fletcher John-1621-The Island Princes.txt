open the port and see the watch relieve 
and let the guard be careful of their business 
their vigilant eye fix on these islander 
they be false and desperate people when they find 
the least occasion open to encouragement 
cruel and crafty soul believe i gentleman 
their late attempt which be too fresh among we 
in which against all arm and honesty 
the governor of Ternata make surprise 
of our confederate the king of Tidore 
as for his recreation he be row 
between both land bid we be wise and circumspect 

it be a mischief sudden imagine 
and as soon do that governor be a fierce knave 
unfaithful as he be fierce too there be no trust 
but I wonder much how such poor and base pleasure 
as tug at a oar or skill in steerage 
shall become prince 

base breed love base pleasure 
they take as much delight in a Baratto 
a little scurvy boat to row she tith 
and have the art to turn and wind she nimble 
think it as noble too though it be slavish 
and a dull labour that decline a gentleman 
as we portugall or the Spaniard do in ride 
in manage a great horse which be princely 
the french in courtship or the dance english 
in carry a fair presence 

he be strange take 
but where no faith be there be no trust he have pay for it 
his sister yet the fair and great Quisara 
have show a noble mind and much love in it 
to her afflict brother and the noble still it appear 
and season of more tenderness because his ruin style her absolute 
and his imprisonment add to her profit 
feel all this which make all man admire she 
the warm beam of this fortune that fall on she 
yet have she make diverse and noble treaty 
and proposition for her brother freedom 
if wealth or honour 

peace peace you be fool sir 
thing of these nature have strange outside Pedro 
and cunning shadow set they far from we 
draw they but near they be gross and they abuse we 
they that observe she close shall find her nature 
which I doubt main will not prove so excellent 
she be a princess and she must be fair 
that be the prerogative of be royal 
let she want eye and nose she must be beauteous 
and she must know it too and the use of it 
and people must believe it they be damn else 
why all the neighbour prince be mad for she 

be she not fair then 

but her hope be fair 
and there be a haughty master the king of Bakan 
that lofty sir that speak far more and loud 
in his own commendation then a cannon 
he be strike dumb with she 

beshrew i she be a sweet one 

and there be that hopeful man of Syana 
that sprightly fellow he that be wise and temperate 
he be a lover too 

will I be worth she look 
for by my life I hold she a complete one 
the very sun I think affect her sweetness 
and dare not as he do to all else die it 
into his tawny livery 

she dare not see he 
but keep herself at distance from his kiss 
and wear her complexion in a case let he but like it 
a week or two or three she will look like a lion 
but the main sport on it be or rather wonder 
the governor of Ternata her mortal enemy 
he that have catch her brother king be strike too 
and be arrive under safe conduct also 
and hostage of worth deliver for he 
and he bring a letter from his prisoner 
whether compel or willing deliver 
from the poor king or what else dare be in it 

so it be honourable any thing it be all one 
for I dare think she will do the best 

it be certain 
he have admittance and solicit hourly 
now if he have the trick 

what trick 

the true one 
to take she too if he be but skill in batfowl 
and lime his bush right 

I will be hang when that hit 
for it be not a compel or force affection 
that must take she I guess her stout and virtuous 
but where be your uncle sir our valiant captain 
the brave Ruy Dias all this while 

I marry 
he be among they too 

a lover

or will stand stiff he be no Portugal else 

the voice say in good favour in the list too 
of the privy wooer how cunning of late 
I have observe he and how private 
he have steal at all hour from we and how ready 
he have feign a business to bid the fort farewell 
for five or six day or a month together

but that this man this herb of grace Ruy Dias 
this father of our faculty shall slip thus 
for sure he be a ferret that he 
that will drink nothing to depress the spirit 
but milk and water eat nothing but thin air 
to make his blood obedient that his youth 
in spite of all his temperance shall tickle 
and have a love mange on he 

it be in he sir 
but honourable courtship and become his rank too 

in i it be abominable lechery or will be

and of the strong part she be most fair 
yet her mind such a mirror 

what a action 
will this be to put forward one what a glory 
and what a everlasting wealth to end it 
methinks my soul be strange raise 

to step into it 
just while they think and ere they have determine 
to bring the king off 

thing have be do as dangerous 

And prosper best when they be least consider 

bless i my hope 
and you my friend assist i

the rest we will council as we go 

away then 
fortune look fair on those make haste to win she 

I have keep many a man and many a great one 
yet I confess I never see before 
a man of such a sufferance he lie now 
where I will not lay my dog for sure it will kill he 
where neither light or comfort can come near he 
nor air nor earth that be wholesome it grieve i 
to see a mighty king with all his glory 
sink of the sudden to the bottom of a dungeon 
whether shall we descend that be poor rascal 
if we have our desert 

it be a strange wonder 
load he with iron oppress he with contempt 
which be the governor command give he nothing 
or so little to sustain life it be next nothing 
they stir not he he smile upon his misery 
and bear they with such strength as if his nature 
have be nurse up and foster with calamity 

he give no ill word curse nor repine not 
blame nothing hope in nothing we can hear of 
and in the midst of all these fright fear nothing 

I will be swear 
he fear not for even when I shake for he 
as many time my pity will compel i 
when other soul that bear nor half his burden 
shrink in their power and burst with their oppression 
then will he sing woo his affliction 
and court they in sad air as if he will wed they 

that be more than we have hear yet we be only 
appoint for his guard but not so near he 
if we can hear that wonder 

many time 
I fear the governor shall come to know it 
for his voice so affect i so delight i 
that when I find his hour I have music ready 
and it stir i infinite be but still and private 
and you may chance to hear 
king appear load with chain his head arm only above 

we will not stir sir 
this be a sudden change but who dare blame it 

now hark and melt for I be sure I shall 
stand silent what stubborn weight of chain 

yet he look temperate 

his eye not sink and his complexion firm still 
no wildness no distemper touch upon he 
how constant he smile and how undaunted 
with what a majesty he heave his head up music 

now mark I know he will sing do not disturb he 
your allowance from the governor will it be more sir 
or in my power to make it handsome 

do not transgress thy charge I take his bounty 
and fortune while I bear a mind content 
not leaven with the glory I be fall from 
nor hang upon vain hope that may corrupt i 

thou be my slave and I appear above thou 

the governor himself 

what at your banquet 
and in such state and with such change of service 

nature be no glutton sir a little serve she 

this diet be wholesome then 

I beg no better 

a calm content mind give he less next 
these full meal will oppress his health his grace 
be of a tender and pure constitution 
and such repletion 

mock mock it move not i sir 
thy mirth as do thy mischief fly behind i 

you carry it handsome but tell i patience 
do not you curse the brave and royal lady 
your gracious sister do not you damn her pity 
damn twenty time a day and dam it serious 
do not you swear aloud too cry and kick 
the very soul sweat in thou with the agony 
of her contempt of i can not thou eat she 
for be so injurious to thy fortune 
thy fair and happy fortune can not thou wish she 
a bastard or a whore fame may proclaim her 
black ugly fame or that thou have have no sister 
spit the general name out and the nature 
blaspheme heaven for make such a mischief 
for give power to pride and will to woman 

no tyrant no I bless and love she for it 
and though her scorn of thou have lay up for i 
as many plague as the corrupt air breed 
as many mischief as the hour have minute 
as many form of death as doubt can figure 
yet I shall love she more still and more honour she 
all thou can lay upon i can bend i 
no not the stroke of death that I despise too 
for if fear can possess i thou have win i 
as little from this hour I prize thy flattery 
and less than those thy prayer though thou will kneel to i 
and if she be not mistress of this nature 
she be none of i no kin and I contemn she 

be you so valiant sir 

yes and so fortunate 
for he that hold my constancy still conquer 
have thou preserve i as a noble enemy 
and as at first make my restraint seem to i 
but only as the shadow of captivity 
I have still speak thou noble still declare thou 
a valiant great and worthy man still love thou 
and still prefer thy fair love to my sister 
but to compel this from i with a misery 
a most inhuman and unhandsome slavery 

you will relent for all this talk I fear not 
and put your wit a work again 

you be cozen 
or if I be so weak to be wrought to it 
so fearful to give way to so much poverty 
how I shall curse her heart if she consent 

you shall write and entreat or 

do thy utmost 
and even in all thy torture I will laugh at thou 
I will think thou no more valiant but a villain 
nothing thou have do brave but like a thief 
achieve by craft and keep by cruelty 
nothing thou can deserve thou be unhonest 
nor no way live to build a name thou be barbarous 

down with he low enough there let he murmur 
and see his diet be so light and little 
he grow not thus high heart on it I will cool you 
and make you cry for mercy and be ready 
to work my end and willing and your sister take down 
your scornful cruel sister shall repent too 
and sue to i for grace 
give he no liberty 
but let his band be double his ease lessen 
nothing his heart desire but vex and torture he 
let he not sleep nothing that be dear to nature 
let he enjoy yet take heed that he die not 
keep he as near death and as willing to embrace it 
but see he arrive not at it I will humble he 
and her stout heart that stand on such defiance 
and let i see her champion that dare venture 
her high and mighty wooer keep your guard close 
and as yond love your life be diligent 
and what I charge observe 

we shall be dutiful Exit Gov 

I will pull your courage king and all your bravery 

most certain he be resolve nothing can stir he 
for if he have but any part about he 
give way to fear or hope he dare not talk thus 
and do thus stout too as willing 
and quiet he sink down to his sorrow 
as some man to their sleep 

yes and sleep with they 
so little he regard they there be the wonder 
and often sound sleep will I dare pity he 
or will it be in my will but we be servant 
and tie unto command 

I wish he better 
but much I fear have find his tomb already 
we must observe our guard 

he can last long 
and when he be dead he be free 

that be the most cruelty 
that we must keep he live 

that be as he please 
for that man that resolve need no physician exeunt 

our prosperous passage be a omen to we 
a lucky and a fair omen 

we believe it
