hold our blood be to precious we will not die 
so like a calf nor by the hand of any 
but our own thus and thus oh this cold steel 
how it offend my flesh I want full strength 
to put it home if thou be valiant and a soldier 
help to dispatch i that be brave do 
oh my mad lust whither will thou bear i 
a dim black fog raise from the lernaean fen 
obscure my sight farewell dear dear mother 
have I be rule by you I have be happy 
now just scourge for disobedience 
a caitiff most accurse she be no other 
that scorn the virtuous counsel of a mother 
so farewell light of eye never to entice 
horror invade my blood I be all ice die 

be she then dead 

and that desperate by her own hand 

o Caesar grant this corpse to my dispose 

it be at your free dispose convey she hence 
and now since we be free by fair revenge 
never shall marriage yoke the mind of Caesar 
to trust the hollow faith of woman more 
and if we do may heaven by treason foul 
shorten our day the sequel of our reign 
shall to the good of Rome suppress black vice 
kingdom be swallow gulf by careless rule 
justice make king the god to imitate 
virtue in prince be the prop of state
