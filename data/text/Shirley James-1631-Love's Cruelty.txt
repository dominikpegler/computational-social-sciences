with a suspicion that I can be so 
unjust as not to acknowledge you have make 
a free and liberal welcome but excuse 

love shall supply what else have be defective 
to express my thanks for your kind visit 

it be 
business that now ravish i away 
by this white hand which but to kiss will tempt i 
to dwell a age here I must wait upon 
the duke 

why so you may

you be not tie to such a strict observance 
that half a hour can prejudice you come 
I know you may dispense with duty so much 

you may command

reflect injurious to yourself 

I know 
you have more charity 

if there be other 
cause that concern your honour or your fortune 
trust i I will not by a minute stay 
be guilty of your wrong and yet methinks 
if there be any thing you may tell i 
there be not a think that I dare keep from you 
no sigh you may know from whence it break 
I have not have a tear but you have search 
the very spring come be it some other friend 

o do not so far wound your servant madam 
to think my heart can allow any time 
for the imagination of another 
woman do all the goodness of the sex 
conspire in one without you I shall love 
my first election and be bless to write 
all my devotion here if by the title 
of friend you understand a man there be 
but one in the whole world I dare call friend 
and I be confident it will trouble i 
as much to find a cause that will offend he 
as to be guilty of the sin 

Hippolito 

if he expect i a day the crime 
be easy purge I can presume on he 

this be but little of that character 
I have hear your tongue deliver if his love 
be what you often have proclaim trust i 
he be a treasure 

such as both the Indies 
shall buy from i 

whatthing rare in he 
above other friend 

his love his love Clariana 

that may be find in many 

but not so rich of so exact a nature 
all other be but drossy 

he will venture 
his life to advance your cause 

he have do it often 
but that be not the thing for which I bosom 
Hippolyta I can return full weight 
of blood for he engage myself to danger 
as high and horrid as he can for i 
but every dare fellow in the street 
can draw a sword and will for his gay honour 
which sway he more than his religion 
in the field maintain a good or impious quarrel 
but he be such a one to i the name 
of friend be too narrow for he and I want 
a word that carry more divinity 
to express his love 

you be not nice to extol he 
what have he do 

a act above all friendship 
that yet have story above all recompense 
I be not capable of a cause to quit 
his unexampled virtue 

this be strange 

you will acknowledge when you hear it and 
it do concern you somewhat 

i pray let not 
my ignorance make i so unhappy not 
to give my thanks if he have aim apat 
of courtesy to i what be it 

he dare not see thou 

dare not see i why 
be I so terrible do he fear I shall 
transform he sure Minerva never dress 
my hair he shall imagine I present 
Medusa to he dare not see i I 
shoot no infection nor breathe any mist 
that shall corrupt he what be his reason pray 

because I love thou I have court he 
as some will do their mistress but to be 
companion of one visit and his love 
will not permit he 

not to see your friend 

he love i so well that he dare not trust 
his frailty with thy sight who I have so 
commend lest before our marriage 
some thing shall share in his affection 
which he have study to preserve entire 
for i he will not trust his eye with any 
beauty I love lest they shall stray with too much 
licence and by degree corrupt his faith 
he know not what may thieve upon his sense 
or what temptation may rise from he 
to undo we all 

a rare and noble friendship 

be it not Clariana 

he need not fear I shall 
commit a rape upon his friendship and 
a love so just and perfect as he can 
with one sight of a woman arm with more 
beauty than i be violate 
he dare not trust his frailty he have fault 
belike though he be such a miracle 
in friendship pray enjoy he and by no mean 
tempt his soft nature to a crime so great 
as see i it shall suffice my love be 
to thou inviolable and what opinion 
for your sake I may modest allow 
the man I never see because your friend 
be confident he have it 

thou be all sweetness 
but I forget my attendance on the duke 
now you allow my absence virtuous thought 
stream in your bosom 

not one kiss at part 

let one speak the devotion of your servant 
that will but dare not stay to print a thousand

the duke pretend she shall be in some place near the duchess 

in some near place with the duke when the duchess be in another bed and never dream on it she may in time be a gamester in the mean time the duke will play at card with she and if he chance turn up a coat the honour shall be she and a stock perhaps to set up the precious sin withal be she not yet ladify

some fury in his blood be there no woman 
he will be a brave man but why do I

and out of fashion with your highness pardon 
I shall be welcome with it to the place

by my consent 

Bellament

that so much beauty shall be cast away 
upon a thankless woman 

how sir 

that will use it to her best advantage 
I have be court this hour for 
a smile

nor I 

I can but congratulate your good fortune

you ever have be hold a honest man 
pray do not mock i it have please his grace 
to give i a new name a ribbon in my forehead 

Sebastian a forehorsebut will I be to be the duke taster 

but there be a price too great set for the honour 
that be my daughter sir and though I say it 
she be yet a virgin will you part with such 
a child to buy a knighthood bribe at such 
expense for a poor title 

it be dark language 
I dare not understand you but you may 
mistake the duke 

I will I do the way 
to be assure be to ask the question sir 

Sebastian you put we well in mind we have forget 
you have too little testimony of our favour 
you shall be captain of our guard 

how be that the duke do love she I hope not honest she be not bear to he a duchess I have it heaven forgive we the duke mean to make her own father the pander it be so he do not use to give such office for nothing well go thy way for a princely ferret she can hold out upon these term 

I know not what to say but do you think 
she shall be safe here be the court a sanctuary 
for virgin 

it be better you be both pickle 

it depend upon the prince chastity 
who example build up virtue 
or make iniquity a trade 

why shall you 
be such a enemy to yourself come fair one 
think who it be that court you he that may command 

my life but not my honour 

your honour why I offer in exchange 
a thousand 

but not all of value to 
repurchase i when I have sell it to 
your wantonness remember sir how much 
you may by one black deed make forfeit of 
your precious eternity 

no doctrine 

warrant not so much ill by your example 
to those that live beneath you if you suffer 
that sordid vice reign in your blood who shall 
be afraid to live with virtue 

let a kiss correct this unkind language 

I want patience to see any man kiss 
a handsome gentlewoman and when my own lip 
can use their own privilege I prophesy what will 
become on she for all her modesty but dare stay 
no long the sight of so much temptation 

why shall any 
promotion charm my honest tongue I will rather 
plough my own acre with my innocence 
then have my name advance by poison honour 
he must not whore my daughter 

I commend 
your noble soul but be advise how you 
express your trouble grief while it be dumb 
do fret within but when we give our thought 
articulate sound we must distinguish hearer 
prince be dangerous and carry death 
upon their tongue I wish you well and speak 
my friendly counsel alas poor gentleman

but you must live at court 

you will be just 
to your own honour and not give i cause 
to curse your entertainment 

you be too scrupulous 

great sir 

Give order for his patent to be draw 
we will create he lord no honour can 
reward your merit and the title will 
become the father of this excellent maid 

his mouth be stop again 

lord what do the duke mean

if these will purchase the old man consent to leave his daughter to his highness mercy for he rise that she may be humble there be other course to be think on Sebastian have be a soldier there be quarrel now in the world and christian war he be a fit man for a general when he be abroad the siege at home will be so desperate 

she must be the court star 

do not you blaze it abroad neither I do not 
think his grace will acquaint his counsel 
with such a cause 

the old man for aught I see have no stomach to it 

where be Hippolito

Were we create man and woman to 
have a command and empire over the creature

and wilful degrade ourselves of reason 
and piety to live like beast nay be such 
for what name else can we allow ourselves 
have it be hold in every age a virtue 
rather to suffer death then stain our honour 
do every sin strike at the soul and wound it 
and shall not this so foul as modesty 
allow no name affright we can the duke 
who wicked cause you plead with justice punish 
those by his law that in this kind offend 
and can he think i innocent or himself 
when he have play the foul adulterer 
prince be god on earth and as their virtue 
do shine more exemplary to the world 
so they strike more immediate at heaven 
when they offend 

I do not trouble you with this divinity 

I see you be a gentleman he favour 
be worthy of his trust and counsel he 
to better way his shame be your dishonour 
for every good man suffer with his prince 
put he in the memory of the holy vow 
when he receive his sceptre

but I will not do it for a hundred angel thank you as much 
as though I do that be the trick of a wise courtier tell 
the prince of his fault

I have no arm no weapon not if I 
be sure the bullet will decline my heart 
it do beget a cowardice to think 
how I be fall 

o pardon 

pardon with what conscience can thou ask it 

you show a charity above my hope 
by give a few minute for my prayer 
which show you have no meaning to destroy 
the soul it be rare compassion but if you 
can possible forgive 

How forgive 

I say if it be possible you can 
remit so foul in i the black offence 
not for the love I have to number day 
but by some noble service to wash off 
this shame this leprosy upon my name 

have you find it now 

I have but vain interrupt your fury 
you can must not pardon it such mercy 
become not a italian 

miserable woman 

o sir it be my first offence what woman be 
without some stain if all that in this kind 
have sin have meet with present death you will 
not find some name that now shine glorious 
within the catalogue of saint my soul 
be full of shame and tear 

tell i Clariana 
still I shall hit upon thy name how can thou 
use i so cruel do I want youth 
and spring about i be my embrace cold 
frost in my blood or in thy bed be I 
convey a snowball roll up the child 
do to play with winter do I not affect thou 
beyond all the comfort of the world 

I know it 

and thou who best of all mankind I love 
who friendship take up my whole heart till she 
come in a wife yet then thou have a seat 
one small degree below she when this shall be 
the talk of Ferrara who shall trust his friend 
for thy sake or at the mention of thy name 
for swear ever to marry 

noble sir 
it be within your power 

to kill you both 

I be prepare so well 
as this short time will give i leave 

it be yet within your power to silence all 
what be already do shall we turn fountain 
we hearty may grieve for not repair 
the world can have no knowledge of our trespass 
nor your dishonour if you call it so 
unless you tell it you have noble sir 
secure all shame at home which have win more 
repentance from i than my tear go on 
increase that piety and be not you 
the trumpet of their infamy abroad 
who live hereafter may be spend with such 
religious sorrow for offend you 
that you may not repent to have forgive 

shall I be win with foolish pity 

our death will gain you nothing but the fear 
you shall keep your own life 

or if blood 
must only satisfy let your sword here 
bathe in revenge the great sinner kill 
if man be not what woman can be ill 

your fear thus vanish I delight not in 
the bloody sacrifice live both 

a miracle 

but I will do more than kill you take my love off 
I do desire never to see you more 
nor will I be a courtier to occasion 
meet hereafter what be do be circle 
within our knowledge pray farewell for you 
I do desire never to bed thou more 
I will force some smile to keep suspicion off 
but fear I never shall love hearty 
again thou have undo i here Clariana 
and yet I will wish thou dead for this 
repent and when I die ask for a kiss exeunt 

not at the court why he desire I shall meet he here 

the duke have often ask for he 

he wait well in the mean time who in the name of wantonness keep he away I know it be a wench it be a perilous boy my own son to a hair and he shall not love a woman I will disinherit he for I be of opinion a atheist sometime be better than a eunuch and yet can the court find he game enough but he must leap the pale and straggle so far for venison that the duke must hunt after he and he be not my own flesh and blood I will counsel he to marry but they be dangerous and a disease be more curable than a wife for she indeed be a hectic fever although I bury my seven year ago yet I feel a grudge of she still and for a need can guess at the change of weather by the knowledge her noise have infuse into my bone

but I be employ by his grace

corrupt a generous soul I be a woman 
the weak of a thousand yet I dare 
give man example rather to be sacrifice 
then betray virtue cause we give our life 
to grow again from our own funeral pile 
like the assyrian bird 

thou have so rich 
a stock of goodness be all other woman 
vicious thou may impart enough to make 
the whole sex white again and leave thyself

I will presume to say I love Eubella 

but have Hippolito no other meaning 
I understand and take some joy to hear this language 

the first proof of my conversion 
shall be to tell the duke he have do ill 
to court thou sinful enter duke

delight heaven take to hear you speak so well 
to the distress Eubella

and yet do not concern i in a high nature than 
my friend a scurvy chance late happen to he 
one that he love most dear you will scarce

first step to heaven a treasure which who want

I wait your purpose 

you be this morning to receive a wife 

and such blessing as the earth be poor 
without she 

it be Eubella I understand 

that most virtuous fair one 

I will not take from she 
I have hear she much commend but she be 
no miracle 

how Clariana 

our sex be poor 
if she alone have all the grace of woman 
though she be fair the dukedom be not so 
barren but it may show some parallel 
and let it not be think a pride if I 
affirm there have be those have say as much 
of i all beauty be not circumscribe 
in one 

you point at that which take the eye 
and be but half a handsomeness at best 
unless the mind be furnish with those virtue 
which write a woman fair but Clariana 
there be no time for this dispute and I 
be somewhat sorry you have fall upon it 
when I but praise Eubella modest 
she be to i the best and fair now 
of all the world but turn to the occasion 
that bring i hither I will hear what practice 
be mean against my life which I will now 
preserve for that dear virgin more than love 
to keep it for my use I do imagine 
however Bellament show a formal 
and calm release yet he will meditate 
revenge at such a time he most shall wound i 
and have not I a perfect confidence 
your thought mean simple pity to my danger 
I shall not thus far have engage myself 
than I beseech you tell i

protection

no use of valour then

Kill my Eubella
