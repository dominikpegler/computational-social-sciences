among all the youthful lover which adore 
your daughter beauty and implore my aid 
don Roderigo and don Sancho strive 
who shall show most the fire her beauty raise 
but yet Cimena be indifferent 
to both their love and with a equal eye 
behold they both nor do she take away 
or add aught to their hope but still expect 
a husband from your choice alone design 

she do her duty both of they deserve she 
both spring from brave and noble family 
both young yet such as in their face show 
the illustrious virtue of their ancestor 
but above all in Roderigo face 
there be not a line which speak not a brave man 
his family have be fruitful still in soldier 
as if they have be bear in the midst of laurel 
his father valour in his time unequalled 
while his strength last be a prodigy 
the furrow in his forehead seem to be 
the ingravement of his noble action 
and Roderigo person seem to promise 
the virtue of his father in conclusion 
my daughter if she love he shall please i 
go entertain she with it but be sure 
you hide my intention and discover she 
at my return we will speak of it together 
time call i now to wait upon the council 
where the king mean to choose a governor 
unto the prince his son or rather seat i 
in that high place of honour for my merit 
forbid i to expect a opposition 

how welcome news will this be to our lover 
how fortune have provide that all thing 
shall sort to their contentment 

how now Elvira 
what in conclusion must I hope or fear 
what must become of i what say my father 

only two word enough to charm your sense 
you can love Roderigo more than he 
do value he 

prithee speak truth Elvira 
the excess of this my happiness do stagger 
my faith in it may I believe thy word 

nay he go far he approve his love 
and will command you meet with his desire 
this you will find soon as the council rise 
and that don Diego meet time and place 
fit for his purpose shall propose the business 
fear not but your desire will be content 

I can tell but yet methinks my soul 
do not receive this joy but all confound 
expect what moment will present to i 
a diverse face from this my happiness 
and cross my present fortune 

you will find 
this fear of you most happy deceive 

well let we go then and attend the issue 

go boy look out Cimena and from i 
tell she her presence be expect soon 
my friendship must complain of this her sloth 

I perceive madam that all day alike 
you be sad and pensive and the same desire 
to know how her love go still press you 

how shall it not when I myself have make she 
receive the hurt wherewith her soul be wound 
she love don Roderigo by my mean 
and by my mean he have vanquish her disdain 
then since to take they I have lay the snare 
to free they unto i belong the care 

and yet in the midst of all their good success 
one may perceive in you a kind of sorrow 
why shall that love which lift they up with joy 
weigh your great heart down with a heavy sadness 
and the interest which you have in their love 
make you unhappy when themselves be bless 
but I be too forward and grow indiscreet 

to stifle it increase more my grief 
Leonora thou shall know it and now hear 
what a strange conflict I have have within i 
and when the have hear it pity my weakness 
admire my virtue love be such a tyrant 
as will spare none this gentleman this lover 
which I have bestow on she I love myself 

you madam 

Lay thy hand upon my heart 
and feel now how it pant at the hear of 
the name of its own conqueror 

pardon i madam 
if blame of your love I do forget 
my due respect be he a match for you 
a private gentleman can you a princess 
in a point of such consequence forget 
who child you be what will the king say think you 
do you remember madam who you be 

yes yes Leonora and will rather die 
than do a thing unworthy of my birth 
though I can tell thou that in noble soul 
merit alone ought to produce true love 
and if my passion will fly to excuse 
many example may authorise it 
yet I will not follow that in which my honour 
must be engage if I have much of love 
I have much more of courage and methinks 
a noble true disdain tell i that I 
the daughter of a king shall deem all other 
below my love unless it be a monarch 
but when I see my heart be not of force 
to make its own defence I give away 
that which I dare not take stead of myself 
I put Cimena fast into his fetter 
and kindle their fire to put out my own 
be not amaze then if with distraction 
I still expect their marriage you see 
all my repose only depend on it 
if love do live on hope it die with it 
it be a fire that not nourish will go out 
and spite of my ill fortune if Cimena 
marry don Roderigo my long hope 
die my mind will be at ease till then 
I be still in torment till his day of marriage 
Roderigo be my love who though I labour 
to lose I can choose but grieve to lose he 
I find my soul divide in two part 
my heart with honour fire as well as love 
this Hymen fatal I both wish and fear it 
nor can I hope for any perfect joy 
since whether he obtain his love or no 
so many bait my love and honour have 
in stead of comfort I must find a grave 

after this madam I have nought to say 
unless it be to grieve for your misfortune 
before I blame you now I pity you 
but since your virtue have make good itself 
so strong against the powerful charm and force 
of love and honour and beat back the assault 
of this and bait of that in a short time 
it will give you ease of all in the meanwhile 
cast your firm hope on heaven which have more justice 
than to let virtue be a sufferer long 

my best of hope be to cast off all hope 

madam cimena come as you command 

go entertain she in the gallery 

but will you still remain in these sad fancy 

no I will spite of all my grief put on 
a face of gladness go I will follow you 
just heaven from whence I do expect my aid 
put now at length some period to my evil 
assure my honour with some ease of love 
I seek my happiness in another bliss 
to which give speed good heaven or more strength 
to my yet feeble soul which never can be 
till Hymen have bind they at liberty 

well sir you have get the day the king high favour 
have lift you to that which be my due 
he have make you governor to the prince of Castille 

this honour which he have do my family 
show he be just and know well how to pay 
with recompense past service 

though king 
be great they be like we and as much subject 
to be deceive as we and this his choice 
make we which be his servant see how ill 
he recompense present service 

pray let we not more of this perhaps to advance 
my business favour do as much as merit 
and happy you have be the better choice 
but yet the king think i more fit for he 
you may to the honour which the king have do i 
add one more if you please in join both 
our family by sacred marriage 
Roderigo love your daughter who he have make 
the chief object of his affection 
give your consent and take he for your son 

o sir Roderigo must look high now 
the splendour of this honour new do you 
ought to put great thought into his heart 
look to your office well govern the prince 
show he the way how he may rule a province 
make people everywhere obey his law 
teach he to love the good to awe the bad 
add to these virtue those of a general 
instruct he how to harden his soft body 
with pain and travel till he leave himself 
without a rival in the art of war 
to sit continue day and night on horseback 
to take his rest in his arm to force a rampire 
and not to owe a victory but to himself 
show he this by example and remember 
you ought to represent what you will teach 

to instruct he by example this I will say 
in spite of envy let he read my life 
and by that story learn to tame fierce nation 
to set on any place to range a army 
and lay his ground of honour on his action 

live example move more forcible 
than book in which a prince scarce learn his duty 
but what I pray have all your long year do 
that one day of my action have not equal 
if you be valiant once I still be so 
this arm be the firm supporter of Castille 
my sword once draw have make Granado tremble 
Arragon quake without i other law 
you must have have and other prince serve 
each day each instant to my eternal glory 
have pile up victory on victory 
the prince to set a edge upon his valour 
march by i shall be victorious 
far from your cold instruction he shall learn 
though to my valour they be prefer by some 
in see my action how to overcome 

in vain you tell i that I know already 
I have see you fight and under i command 
when age have shrink my sinew up with cold 
your youth and valour have supply my place 
but not to make so many word of nothing 
you be what I be once and yet the king 
betwixt our desert have put a difference 

that which be my desert you have obtain 

he that have get it sure have best deserve it 

he that can best discharge it best deserve it 

it be no good sign though to be put beside it 

like a old courtier by much suit you get it 

my honourable action stand for i 

Come come the king thus honour your grey hair 

he prize my valour when he give it i 

if so the honour have be i not you 

he that can not obtain it do not deserve it 

not I deserve it mean you 

no not you 

take that rash dotard for thy impudence 

nay make it up and after this affront 
take my life too 

what do thou hope to do thou feeble fool 
thy sword be i but yet I scorn to take it 
go now and bid the prince read over thy life 
and let he not omit this part of it 
in which he will find the just revenge I take 
of this thy insolence a fair example 

will you then spare my life 

I be satisfy 
my eye cry shame unto my hand for this 

then you do scorn to take it 

if I shall 
I do but cut the thread of three day last 

rage and despair must I needs live thus long 
to see this one day of my infamy 
blast all the trophy of my former year 
oh fatal dignity which be to i 
no other than a precipice from whence 
my honour headlong fall unto the earth 
let he that have disarm i take the place 
of governor to the prince for I that be 
a man dishonour be not fit for it 
and thou my sword that hang here for a show 
the glorious instrument of my action past 
but now the idle ornament of my age 
go to his hand that can tell how to use thou 
be then my son who if he be my own 
can but have a sense of my dishonour 
and though he love Cimena yet it be fit 
his love give place to the more ardent fire 
of valour animate by a affront 
which though it fall on i do yet result 
on he and see he be here Roderigo tell i 
have the any courage 

any man but my father 
shall quick find I have 

Well say my boy 
I now perceive my blood run in thy vein 
this noble anger say thou be my son 
my youth revive in i from this thy heat 
thou shall revenge i son 

of what or who 

of a affront so cruel that our honour 
suffer together in it it be Roderigo 
a box of the ear which on the insolent giver 
I have revenge but that my feeble age 
fail my strong heart this sword then which my arm 
know not to wield take thou and with it punish 
the arrogant that wrong i and be sure 
thou kill or die for such a stain as this 
be never wash but in the offender blood 
but let i tell thou I do send thou now 
to combat with a man who I have see 
all on a gore in midst of a fight battle 
make himself a rampire of slay man 

pray sir his name let he be what he will 

to tell thou more then beside that he be 
the brave soldier and the best commander 
that I have see he be 

for heaven sake what 

the father to Cimena 

The 

reply not 
I know thy love but yet remember son 
he that can live contemn do not deserve 
to breathe a hour thou know the affront be give 
to i to thou I leave the just revenge 
the sense of honour and the fire that spring 
from thence shall put out the less heat of love 
revenge i and thyself show thyself worthy 
of i thy father now overbear with misery 
which while I go to moan haste thou to punish 

strike to the very heart with a blow as fatal 
as unforeseen what shall I do I must 
revenge my father and provoke my mistress 
either betray my honour or my love 
it be a better choice for i to die 
than to do either 
if I revenge my father I must lose 
my love if not I must live infamous 
how can I live have lose all I live for 
but infamy pursue i after death 
on then my soul and rather choose to die 
lose thy love than live inglorious 
and start not at the name of the offender 
because he be the father of thy mistress 
but rather think thy own receive the offence 
and thou be bind to give the recompense 

i must needs say when I do give the affront 
my blood be overheat and my hand 
somewhat too ready but now who can help it 
since it be do it can be recall 

faith let your courage stoop to the king will 
he take the business much to heart and be 
so high incense believe it he will proceed 
with his full power and then what defence 
can you make for yourself when the affront 
and it be high quality shall be aggravate 
by the person of the offend and the place 
these will require of you my lord submission 
beyond all ordinary satisfaction 

then let he take my life it be in his power 

Abate some of your heat and hear what be reason 
will you not seek to appease a prince that love you 
he say I will have this do will not you do it 

sir to preserve my honour I can think 
it be such a crime somewhat to disobey 
but be it great what I have do for he 
will be more than enough to make my excuse 

suppose you have do all that a man can think 
in the king service be he bind to thank you 
can a prince be behold to a subject 
you be too much overweening you must know 
he that best serve his king do but his duty 
if you think otherwise you be undo 

I shall believe you when I find it so 

your can it but fear the power of the king 

one day destroy not such a man as I be 
let he arm all his power to punish i 
the state shall rather perish than I suffer 

do you so little fear the sovereign power 

what of that sceptre which if not for i 
have ere now fall out of his hand my person 
be sir of so much consequence to the king 
that if my head fall his crown can stand 

my lord give reason leave to settle you 
think on it a little 

the thought be already take 

what shall I say then I must give he a account 

This that I know not how to give consent 
to my own shame 

but my lord imagine 
king will be absolute 

let they be so 
the die be cast sir let we talk no more on it 

then I must take my leave since my persuasion 
can do no good though you be cover over 
with laurel yet my lord take heed of thunder 

I will wait it without fear 

it will come home 

if it do D Diego satisfy 
how little be I scare with these poor threat 
my honour once engage a thousand death 
present to i in the most hideous form 
can once startle i 

my lord a word 

speak 

resolve i of a doubt do you know 
don Diego well 

I do 

and that he be 
the spirit and the glory of his time 
do you know this 

perhaps he may be so 

and that this ardour which my eye do bear 
do you know it be his blood it represent 

what be that to i 

some distance from this place 
I will make you know it 

presumptuous boy 

be not so hot I know I be young but yet 
in noble soul valour prevent their year 

but who have lead thou to that vanity 
to set thou upon i thou that do never 
bear arm perhaps thou know not who I be 

yes and I know a stout man than I 
will tremble at the hear of thy name 
thy head be cover over with laurel where 
victory perch and from thence read to i 
the fate of my destruction I do challenge 
like a rash youth a man inure to conquest 
yet have heart enough I shall want strength 
or if I shall wear my father cause 
upon my sword and arm they can fail i 

this courage which appear in thy discourse 
I have be long acquaint with and hope 
to see the honour of Castille in thou 
it be in my thought to give my daughter to thou 
I know thy love and be amaze to see 
it be motion to give place unto thy honour 
and mean to find out a perfect man 
and complete cavalier for my son in law 
I be not mistake in the choice I have make 
but here my pity intervene and though 
I wonder at thy courage yet I grieve 
to see thy rashness do not seek thy death 
prithee excuse my valour from a combat 
so far unequal if thou fall by i 
it will be no honour to i to overcome 
where there be no danger will be a triumph 
where there be no glory for thou will be think 
to have with ease be ruine and myself 
shall alone feel the grief that I have do it 

the have second the affront thou give my father 
with a pity worse than that dare thou deprive i 
of my honour and yet fear to take my life 

leave i good youth 

let we go and talk no more on it 

be thou so weary of thy life 

be thou 
so afraid to die 

Come then thou do not more 
than be thy duty he be a degenerate son 
that will outlive one jot his father honour 

be not so grieve Cimena dry thy eye 
use now thy constancy in this misfortune 
thou will see it clear up after a little tempest 
thy happiness be but cloud for a while 
and some small time will make thou no great loser 

what can I hope now but continual trouble 
a storm so sudden come over this calm 
threaten a certain shipwreck to our love 
it be past all doubt I perish in the haven 
I love be love again our friend agree 
and I no soon have tell you the news 
but in a ill hour spring their fatal quarrel 
which when I hear I know my hope be ruine 
curse ambition honour pitiless 
under who tyranny the brave soul 
do ever suffer how many tear and sigh 
must I pay for you 

thou have no reason 
to fear their quarrel which on a sudden bear 
will as soon die there be too much noise of it 
to let it live the king shall take it up 
and for thy sake I will see it shall go no far 

this business will admit no composition 
the affront to honour never be repair 
wisdom or power can prevail little here 
this wound will not be heal it may be cover 
and stifle hate nourish secret fire 
within the breast but such as burn more fierce 

but the holy knot which shall once join Cimena 
to Roderigo will dissolve the hatred 
of both their father and the bond of love 
as be more strong will quick stop their discord 

rather do desire than hope it madam 
don Diego be too haughty and I know 
my father well of what a spirit he be 
I feel my tear run which I will retain 
what be past torment i and I fear the sequel 

do thou fear what a weak old man can do 

Roderigo be not weak 

but he be too young 

valiant young man be ever very sudden 

but that thou need not fear he love thou too well 
to anger or displease thou one poor word 
out of thy mouth will quick stay his heat 

if he do not obey how great be my grief 
and if he do what will man say of he 
that be a gentleman he can put up 
such a affront so that if he resist 
or else give way to his affection 
I can but be trouble or ashame 
at his too much respect or just denial 

cimena generous and though she be 
engage she can suffer a base thought 
but if I make a prisoner of this lover 
until this business be take up betwixt they 
will not your love turn into jealousy 

ah madam in this case I have no such thought 

boy look out Roderigo bring he hither 

he and the count of gormas 

good God I tremble 

speak 

go out together 

alone 

alone and as it seem they go to quarrel 

ay i my fear be they be fight by this time 

let we spend no more time then but go look they out 

be he so vain have he so little reason 
that he dare think his crime yet pardonable 

I treat long with he on your behalf 
I do sir my devoir but obtain nothing 

just heaven can a subject be so rash 
to have so little care to please his master 
he have strike don Diego scorn his king 
in my own court he mean to give i law 
be he never so good a soldier or commander 
I will make he know what it be to disobey 
I will have treat he with all fair mean 
but since he have abuse my patience 
go some of you and look he out and whether 
he do resist or not make sure of he 

perhaps some little time will bring he in 
he be take boil in his choler sir 
and a stout heart will hardly yield to reason 
in the first motion of its rage and heat 
here be no man that not think he be to blame 
but yet so high a spirit be not bring 
at first so easy to confess his fault 

don Sancho hold your peace and let i tell you 
he that shall take his part be alike faulty 

I obey sir and be silent but with favour 
a word in his defence 

what can you say 

sir that a soul accustom to great action 
can abase itself too low submission 
it know not how to do it without shame 
and that be the word which trouble most the count 
he find it somewhat hard to do his duty 
he will obey if he have less of courage 
if you will command that he be use to arm 
shall with his sword repair this injury 
I will undertake he shall make satisfaction 

you be too bold sir but your age I pardon 
think it to proceed from heat of youth 
a prudent king know better how to husband 
his subject blood then so to venture they 
for i I mean my care shall still conserve they 
as the head care for the member which do serve it 
you speak sir as a soldier but I must 
do as a king and whatsoever the count 
do say or think I be sure he can lose 
aught of his honour in obey i 
the affront he do to he who I have make 
governor to my son do touch i near 
and this his insolence have quarrel i 
and the choice I make so if he do submit 
I be the man he satisfy but no more 
don Arias by a advice of late receive 
I hear the moor mean short to surprise we 

Dare the moor stir 

their vessel be discover 
at the river mouth and you know how easy 
at a full sea they may come up 

the battle 
they have lose already shall make they lose the heart 
to set on such a conqueror as you 

they can but with jealousy look on 
see i rule in Andalusia 
and this fair country which I take from they 
keep their design awake it be the reason 
why here in Sevill I have place my throne 
that be near them I may be more ready 
to meet with their attempt 

sir they have learn 
at the great charge of their own head by this time 
how much your presence do assure your conquest 
you have nothing sir to fear 

nor to neglect 
too much assurance still draw danger with it 
the enemy which we now think to destroy 
if he can take his time may annoy we 
but yet since I be not certain of my news 
I will not stir up in my subject heart 
vain panic terror or this present night 
affright the city with a false alarm 
let the haven be well guard and the wall 
and for this night it shall suffice 

sir the count be dead 
Roderigo hand have satisfy his father 

I divine what will follow when I first 
hear of the affront and will have then prevent it 

sir here be Cimena who present her grief 
upon her knee with tear demand justice 

although my soul suffer with his misfortune 
the affront he do deserve the punishment 
which though it be most just yet can it I lose 
without regret a servant of his merit 

justice sir justice I ask it on my knee 

o sir give ear to my defence 

revenge my father death 

of he that punish the high insolence 

Roderigo sir 

have do the office of a honest man 

have kill my father 

have revenge his own 

a king owe justice to his subject blood 

a just revenge can fear no punishment 

rise both of you and speak without disturbance 
I bear a part Cimena in thy suffering 
trouble she not when she have do I will hear you 

my father be slay sir and these eye have see 
his blood gush out in bubble that dear blood 
which have so oft preserve your wall so oft 
be fire to gain you battle and which yet 
reek with just anger to have be spill for any 
but you the king which war dare never draw 
Roderigo in your court have make to flow 
upon the earth and for his first essay 
have take away the firm prop of your state 
breathless and pale I come unto the place 
and find he dead dead pardon sir my grief 
my voice do fail i let my tear speak the rest 

daughter take comfort and be confident 
thou have a king will be a father to thou 

you have do my misery sir too much honour 
thither I come amaze and find he dead 
he speak nought to i but the more to move i 
his spill blood write my duty on the dust 
rather his worth reduce to that poor state 
speak to i through his wound and hasten i 
to this pursuit and to be hear the better 
of the most just of king borrow my voice 
suffer not sir such rage to pass unpunished 
before your eye and let not heady youth 
lave themselves in the blood of your best soldier 
and brave their memory if you permit it 
you will have but few that will desire to serve you 
in fine my father be dead I demand justice 
rather for you than my own interest 
you be engage in the loss of such a man 
revenge it then and require blood for blood 
sacrifice D Diego and his family 
to yourself to the people to Castille 
what can be dear enough to satisfy 
for my dead father 

D Diego answer 

how happy be the man sir 
who part not soon with his strength than life 
since to the valiant age be most unhappy 
accompany with weakness I that have 
get such glory by my former action 
who victory have ever wait on 
see myself now for have live too long 
affront and overcome and that which neither 
combat nor siege nor ambush can do 
nor all your enemy nor i to boot 
the pride of one man in your court have do 
almost before your face and sully 
the reverence and honour of my age 
advantage by his youth and by my weakness 
and so sir these my hair which have grow white 
under my helmet and my blood which have 
so oft for you be spend shall have descend 
unto the grave with cureless infamy 
have I not get a son to save my honour 
who lend i his hand have slay the count 
if to show courage and a sense of wrong 
if to revenge a blow of the face deserve 
severe to be punish let it fall 
on i that tempest whatsoever it be 
for the arm fault we punish oft the head 
I be the head sir he be but the arm 
and if Cimena do complain that he 
have slay her father I must answer she 
have I be able he have never do it 
sacrifice then this head which age will take 
the arm sir may hereafter do you service 
and let cimena wrong be satisfy 
at my own blood be expense and I shall be 
so far from think it a unjust censure 
that die with my honour I shall die 
without t regret 

the affair be of importance 
and merit to be hear in a full counsel 
don Sancho wait upon Cimena home 
don Diego word shall be his surety 
let his son be look out I will do you justice 

it be just great sir to cut off murderer 

daughter take truce a little with your grief 

to give they truce be to increase they more 

what mean you Roderigo whither will you 

I will pursue the course of my sad fortune 

but this be a strange boldness to appear 
in the same place which you have fill with mourning 
come you to affront the ghost of the dead count 
have not you slay he 

his life be my disgrace 
my honour at my hand require this death 

but in the house of death to look for refuge 
do ever homicide make that his asylum 

do never any murderer present 
himself unto his judge never wonder at i 
I come to seek for that I give another 
that be death my love Cimena be my judge 
when I deserve her hate I deserve death 
and for that cause I stand here to receive 
my sentence from her mouth death from her hand 

fly rather from her sight and do not meet 
with the first motion of her grief and anger 
why will you more inflame her present passion

glut yourself with the pleasure of my death 

what place be this Elvira who be this 
Roderigo in my house before my face

I die 

a word 

away and let i die 

and afterward 
make i no answer but with this my sword 

that sword be smear with the blood of my dead father 

my Cimena 

fie take away that object 
which to my eye upbraid thy crime and life 

look on it rather to increase thy hate 
to excite thy anger and to speed my death 

it be die in my own blood 

plunge it in i 
and make it lose the colour so of thou 

what cruelty be this which in one day 
father and daughter both deprive of life 
one by the sword the other by the sight 
remove that object of my hate thy sword 
thou will be hear of she thou mean to kill 

I do obey yet with the same desire 
to die by thou for from my affection 
never expect a cowardly repentance 
of a good action the box of the ear 
thy father give dishonour my thou know 
how home that touch any man of spirit 
I share in the affront and go to seek 
the author have find he I revenge 
mine and my father honour be it to do 
again I will do it yet think not but thy love 
hold out against my father and myself 
a combat long enough and make i doubt 
whether I shall displease thou or sit down 
by the injury receive I hold my hand 
and blame myself for too much violence 
and without doubt thy beauty have over sway 
have I not cast in balance that a man 
dishonour never can be worthy thou 
that she who love i when my fame stand clear 
will hate i stain with infamy it be true 
I do thou a affront and it be as true 
I ought to do it both to save my honour 
and merit thou but have thus acquit 
my father and myself it be only you 
that I now come to satisfy and make 
a present of my blood I know the thought 
of a slay father arm thy hate against i 
nor will I rob thou of thy sacrifice 
here offer to the blood already shed 
the blood of he that glory to have shed it 

true Roderigo though thy enemy 
that thou do shun disgrace I can blame thou 
and whatsoever face my grief put on 
I not accuse thou but my own misfortune 
I know what honour after such a out rage 
demand of any brave and generous spirit 
thou do thy duty but in do it 
thou teach i mine the same regard thou have 
to vindicate thy own and father honour 
fall now one i and the more to afflict i 
of thou I must require what I have lose 
it be thy interest make i despair 
have any other hand or sad misfortune 
deprive i of my father I have find 
my comfort in thy sight the only charm 
against my grief when by so dear a hand 
my tear have be wipe off but now I must 
lose he and thou too and what be more cruel 
I be bind myself to labour thy destruction 
for never look from my affection 
the least resentment for thy punishment 
for though our love will speak in favour of thou 
my honour yet must go as high as thou 
thou in my wrong show thyself worthy i 
I in thy death will appear worthy thou 

never defer then long what your honour 
require of you it demand my head 
to stay till justice give it you will delay 
as well your glory as my punishment 
I shall die happy die by your hand 

away I be thy accuser not thy headsman 
be it fit for i to take the head thou offer 
it be of another that I must obtain it 
I must pursue thy crime not punish it 

though love speak to thou in my favour yet 
the bravery of thy mind ought to answer i 
which trust i my Cimena can be 
if to revenge thou borrow other hand 
for my revenge I use none but my own 
and thou for thou must use thy hand alone 

cruel to be so obstinate in this 
if without help thou do revenge thyself 
why do thou offer it i I will follow thou 
my courage be too great to let thou bear 
the least part in my glory neither shall 
i or my father honour stoop so low 
as to thy love or thy despair to owe 

hard point of honour can I by no way 
obtain this grace punish i in the name 
of thy dead father or our dear love 
either do it in revenge or else in pity 
it will to thy lover prove a gentle fate 
to die thus by thy hand than to live with thy hate 

away I hate thou not 

thou ought to hate i 

I can it 

but fear thou not the blame and scandal 
which man will raise when they shall know my crime 
and the continuance of thy love no rather 
force they to silence and without more word 
by my death give thy reputation life 

it will live better if I let thou live 
I will have the voice of the most black mouth envy 
admire my glory and pity my hard suffering 
when they shall know that though I love thy person 
I prosecute thy crime go Roderigo 
and let the darkness of the night conceal 
thy part hence my honour can run 
a great hazard than if man shall know 
that I have keep thou company so long 

it be death to hear this 

away 

but what be you resolve to do 

spite of this love fire which will restrain 
that of my anger I shall do my best 
to have full vengeance for my father death 
and yet in spite of this so cruel honour 
my desire be to have my desire cross 

o miracle of love 

but heap with grief 

how many tear will these our father cost we 

who will have think it Roderigo 
who 

Cimena will have say it 

that our joy 
shall be so nigh we and so quick lose 

and that so near the port a sudden storm 
shall shipwreck all our hope 

go Roderigo 
and think I can dare not hear thou long 

I go then to draw out a die life 
till thy pursuit shall bring it to a end 

if I obtain the effect I sad vow 
not to draw breath one minute after thou 
adieu and have a care thou be not see 

at length I see what all my industry 
can not effect chance offer to i this 
must be my son Roderigo bless be heaven 
that give i leave to see thou 

ay i 

do not confound my joy with these sad accent 
but give i leave to praise thy early valour 
which show the noble stock from which thou spring 
the first stroke of thy sword have equal all 
that mine can do and thy brave youthful spirit 
have reach the glory of thy ancestor 
prop of my age and fullness of my joy 
touch these white hair who honour thou have save 
come kiss this cheek and view the place which thou 
be affront rescue from disgrace 

the honour be due to you heaven be my witness 
that come from you I can do no less 
I hold myself most happy that the first 
trial of my poor valour shall please he 
to who I owe my life but in these pleasure 
have not a jealousy of i because 
after you I dare satisfy myself 
give i leave to despair it be all I ask 
let not your praise flatter i out of that 

by from so brave a heart banish this weakness 
think there be mistress enough in the world 
but no more than one honour love be but 
a little pleasure honour be a duty 

what say you sir 

that which thou ought to know 

will you then shame i with inconstancy 
a coward soldier and a perjure lover 
run the same course of infamy alike 
can I be think generous unless 
I be perfidious alas my bond 
be too fast tie to be so soon undo 
and since I can nor have nor leave my love 
the death I mean to seek be my best comfort 

this be no time to seek out death thy king 
thy country need thy aid the fleet we fear 
that enter on the river be now ready 
to take the city by surprise the moor 
be come in silence almost to our wall 
the court be in a uproar and the people 
call to take arm nothing but cry be hear 
in the midst of these calamity my fortune 
have favour i so much to let i see 
five hundred of my friend within my house 
who hear of the affront be give i 
offer their life to vindicate my honour 
thou have prevent they but their brave valour 
will better be employ against the moor 
go march in the head of they where honour call thou 
impeach the land of the enemy 
and if thou must seek death go find it there 
but rather crown with victory return 
and by thy valour force even justice self 
to pardon and Cimena to be silent 
if thou do love she think thy come home 
a conqueror must regain her heart or nothing 
but time be too precious to be spend in talk 
I stay thou in discourse when thou shall fly 
come follow i to my house let the king see 
what he have lose in the count he have find in thou 

but be this true Elvira be thou sure on it 

how hard it be to be faith in you 
when every man extoll the glorious action 
of this young Heros the moor before he 
appear but to their shame they quick land 
but quick be their flight three hour fight 
leave to our man a victory entire 
and two king prisoner their leader valour 
can meet with nothing dare stand in its way 

and be it Roderigo hand that do these wonder 

the two king which he vanquish be his prize 

whence can thou gather this strange news Elvira 

from those who sound his praise up and down 
the people who with one voice do salute he 
their guardian angel saver of their country 

how do the king look upon this his valour 

Roderigo dare not yet appear in court 
but don Diego in the conqueror name 
have make a present of these crown captive 
and all he do demand be that the king 
will deign to see the hand that free his country 

but have he get no wound 

I know not that 
why change you colour so resume your spirit 

let i resume my anger which my love 
have so enfeeble must my care for he 
make i forget myself peace peace my love 
and let my anger work though he have vanquish 
two king he have not overcome my duty 
these mourn habit where I read my misery 
be the first fruit his valour do produce 
and though all tongue shall speak in his defence 
all object here do represent his crime 
veil cypress and these black sad memory 
of my dead father keep a little up 
my honour against my passion and when love 
shall get the power of i tell my heart 
I owe a duty to a father slay 

be not transport so the infanta here 

I come not here Cimena with faint comfort 
to plead against thy grief but with sad sigh 
to mingle with thy tear 

nay rather madam 
share in the common joy and full taste 
the happiness kind heaven have send to you 
I only be design for grief the danger 
from which you be rescue by Roderigo hand 
and all your safety purchase by his arm 
to i alone bequeath these tear and sigh 
it be he have save the city serve his king 
and only ruine i 

it be true Cimena 
he have do wonder 

yes the unwelcome news 
have pierce my ear already I can hear 
how the voice go and that he be fame no less 
a valiant soldier than a luckless lover 

how come this news to be unwelcome to you 
be not the man they praise your servant once 
and have not he your heart in honour he 
they honour much your choice 

I needs must say 
his honour be but due and yet to i 
each praise of he be a new punishment 
for I can it choose but know how great my loss be 
find the value of the thing I lose 
the more his merit and my love increase 
the more my duty get advantage of i 
and spite of my affection put i on 
to prosecute his crime 

but will you madam 
believe the counsel of a faithful friend 

not to obey you be a sin unpardonable 

though yesterday pursue your revenge 
you do so much that all the court admire 
your height of spirit and bewail your love 
yet the same way be not now to be take 
Roderigo now the only hope and stay 
of all Castille the terror of the moor 
his valour have restore we what before 
it take away in he your father seem 
to live again and in a word pursue 
his death you go about the public ruin 
what to revenge a father be it lawful 
to give your country up to its enemy 
and be we to be punish for his fault 
I say not this that I will have you marry 
the man you be bind to prosecute I will rather 
you shall avoid that envy and deprive 
he of your love but not we of his life 

ah madam give my spirit it be full course 
though my heart make a faction against i 
though he be love by the king adore by the people 
though he be compass with the stout soldier 
he overwhelm his laurel with my cypress 

I must confess it be a mark of spirit 
to prosecute the life you love so dear 
yet I shall think it be more noble fat 
to give up to the public interest 
the private one of blood for credit i 
Cimena it be enough to leave to love he 
banish he from your heart and he will find 
a heavy punishment your country good 
require this beside you must not think 
the king shall grant you your request 

he may 
refuse i if he please but I must speak 

Consider well Cimena what it be 
you go about and think of it at leisure 

thou brave descendent of a noble race 
who have be still supporter of my kingdom 
who be valour the first proof of thou have equal 
my power be too narrow for thy merit 
to free thy country of so rude a foe 
as be the moor before myself can give 
order for their repulse be such a act 
as fly beyond all thought of recompense 
but the two captive king which thou have take 
shall give thou thy reward they both have name thou 
their Cid before i which in their tongue sound 
as much as lord in we and this fair title 
I will not envy thou from henceforth be 
their Cid that at thy name the moor may tremble 
and that my subject hear it may know 
thy value and how much to thou I owe 

let not your majesty confound your servant 
with too much shame to set so high a prize 
upon so poor a service I must blush 
to see such honour do so slender merit 
my debt to you sir and my country be 
the blood I live by and the air I breathe 
and when I lose they for so fair a object 
I do sir but the duty of a subject 

Few of those who their duty bind to serve i 
can so acquit themselves as thou have do 
suffer then thy just praise and at full 
relate the story of thy victory 

sir you have hear how in this urgent danger 
which put the city in so great a tumult 
a company of my friend meet at my father 
move i to go upon this enterprise 
but I crave pardon of your majesty 
for dare to employ they without leave 
the danger be at hand so be my friend 
the hazard of my head make i I dare not 
appear at court and I have rather lose 
my life in the defence of the whole state 
than give it up unto cimena plaint 

I must excuse the heat of thy revenge 
the state defend speak in thy defence 
henceforth Cimena move i but in vain 
who if I hear it be but to give her comfort 
but on with your relation 

under i 
this troop advance with such a confidence 
and so good order that where ere they pass 
they diffuse courage through the looker on 
which so much move they that although at first 
we number but five hundred ere we reach 
the port we be increase into three thousand 
two three of these when I arrive I hide 
in the bottom of our ship which there I find 
the rest who number every hour increase 
lie close to the ground and in deep silence past 
the great part of that fair night away 
to the guard I give command to do the like 
affirm stout that I have your order 
for what I do at length the glimmer star light 
make we discover thirty sail come up 
with a full tide for the swell sea at once 
pour both itself and they into our haven 
we let they pass discover none of we 
in the haven or the wall and this our silence 
make they so confident of our surprise 
that present they land fierce run 
to meet the ruin which await they 
then rise we up have receive the signal 
from those within our ship 
who start up in arm do so confound 
the moor that they be fright ere half land 
they come to pillage but they meet with war 
at sea and land we bear they down before we 
many we slay in the place before they can 
fall into rank or make the least resistance 
when sudden in spite of our endeavour 
their prince rally their disperse troop 
and from a shame they feel to die so tame 
they take new courage and restore their rank 
with their sword draw make their fight on foot 
then fall the brave of our soldier 
mix with their captain the land the water 
their fleet our haven seem a field of slaughter 
where death do only triumph blood and darkness 
cover the place what have their valour be 
who fight thus in the dark have they be see 
ay on all side encourage our own man 
some I make fall upon the foe and other 
I keep from fall from we those that come 
I range in order put they on the place 
which they be to make good but what be do 
we have no mean to know till the first light 
show we our victory and their loss 
they see a new supply come to our aid 
flee now more fierce than before they fight 
they get into their ship and cut their cable 
disorderly retreat and not mind 
whether their king retire or stay behind 
fear more prevail make they lose their duty 
they come in with the flood and with the ebb 
they go away in the mean time their king 
and some few of their man engage among we 
sell their life dear enough I bid them yield 
but while they have a sword to fight they will not 
till see their soldier fall about their foot 
and that alone they must defend themselves 
they ask who be our leader I be name 
they yield themselves to i So be this battle 
end for want of man to fight it out 
and thus sir when we be about your service 

sir here be Cimena come to ask you justice 

what shall I do I will not have she see thou 
in stead of thanks I must dismiss thou from i 
but ere thou leave the court return again 
unto thy king embrace 

it be strange she shall 
pursue the man thus who she fain will save 

I be tell she be in love with he I will try 
make show as you be sad at length Cimena 
content yourself for your desire have meet 
with their success though Roderigo valour 
have get the better of the moor himself 
have perish with the wound he there receive 
give thanks to heaven that have give you vengeance 
her colour be change already 

but sir mark 
her swound and by they how she betray 
the secret of her soul sure she love he 

be Roderigo dead then 

no no he live 
and still remain thy true and constant lover 
thou shall enjoy he take thy mirth again 

sir we as often faint with joy as sadness 
and when excess of that surprise we 
it soon confound our sense 

thou will feign 
that to do thou a courtesy we shall 
believe impossibles but here thy sadness 
have show itself too plain 

well sir you may 
add this too if you please to my misfortune 
and call my swound the effect of grief 
I must confess I grieve to see myself 
robe of the life I sue for if he die 
of wound he have receive for be country good 
my vengeance be lose and my design betray 
I ask his death but not a glorious one 
I will not have he die in the bed of honour 
but on a scaffold that his name may rot 
and his memorial perish it be no shame 
to say I love his victory by it 
he have assure the state and render i 
a noble sacrifice in stead of flower 
crown with victorious bay and such a one 
as I will have offer to my father ghost 
but why alas be I transport so 
Roderigo need not fear what I can do 
what can a virgin tear despise and scorn 
your kingdom be to he a place of free 
security and he shall triumph over i 
as over his enemy the blood of the moor 
shall choke up justice here which must be make 
a trophy to the victor crime while I 
among the rest adorn his victory 

sweet heart you be too much hurry with your passion 
we when we render justice use to cast 
each thing in balance Roderigo kill 
thy father but he give the first offence 
equity bind i then to show some sweetness 
to the first injure but before thou accuse he 
ask counsel of thy heart of which he be master 
I be sure thy love secret thank thy king 
who favour keep so brave a lover for thou 

for i my enemy the author of 
my miscry the murderer of my father 
be my just suit so slight that I be think 
to be oblige because I be not hear 
sir since my tear can obtain it of you 
let the sword I beseech you give i justice 
by that I be injure and by that I crave 
to be revenge of all your cavalier 
I ask his head to he that bring it i 
as to the conqueror I give myself 
the combat end he shall be my husband 
this I beseech your majesty may be publish 
by your authority 

this country custom 
more ancient than good under the colour 
of punish unjust attempt have robe 
the state of its best soldier and often 
the success do not answer the intent 
the guilty escape and kill the innocent 
I must dispense with Roderigo blood 
it be more precious to i than so slight 
to be expose to hazard though his spirit 
force he to do a outrage yet in free 
his country from the moor he have free himself 

how sir for he must you reverse your law 
which have so often be observe what will 
the people or the tongue of envy say 
hear he live by your protection 
and that it only serve he for a colour 
to hide his cowardice these be favor sir 
which bring dishonour with they to the taker 
the count dare do a wrong my son dare punish 
let he maintain the honour he have win 

since you will have it so let it be do 
but if Roderigo be expose to all 
that will come in to fight for such a prize 
he must be sure to want no enemy 
I will have only one to encounter he 
choose who you will Cimena and choose wise 
but after this urge i to nothing far 

an it please your majesty to let the list 
be open I shall be the undertaker 
madam you know your promise I beseech you 
let i obtain the grace to be your champion 

what say you Cimena shall he be the man 

sir I have promise he 

be ready than tomorrow 

defer it not so long sir 
a man of courage be at all time ready 

shall he no soon be return from one 
but he must enter on another fight 

he have take breath sir in recount it 

however a hour or two let he repose 
but lest I shall be think to countenance 
proceed of this bloody nature neither 
myself nor any of my court shall see it perform 
do you look to it and take care that both 
present themselves as befit man of arm 
the combat do bring i the conqueror 
I mean myself to give he to Cimena 

that be to impose too hear a law upon i 

thy love dare not avow this thy complaint 
if Roderigo conquer thou must have he 
never dispute my sentence or repine 
who ere be victor I will make he thou 

what Roderigo in the open day 
whence come this boldness do you mean to undo 
i and my honour fie retire yourself 

madam I go to die and therefore come 
before my death to take my last farewell 
my love do owe you this and my thrall heart 
dare not depart your kingdom without leave 

you go to die 

nay more I run as soon 
as I have take my leave the count be revenge 

you go to die and be don Sancho then 
a man so terrible that you need fear he 
who have make you so weak or he so valiant 
Roderigo go to fight and think himself 
already dead he that nor fear the moor 
nor yet my father go to encounter 
don Sancho tremble at it do your spirit 
fail you at great need 

it be not to the combat 
that I go now but to my punishment 
for when you seek my death my love can 
defend a life against you my heart be still 
the same but not my arm when it shall guard 
that which displease you this night already 
have be my last if for my private quarrel 
the fight have be but since it be for the king 
his people and my country have I leave 
myself defenceless I will betray they all 
I must confess I do not hate my life 
so much as with false treachery to part from it 
now since no interest but my own be in it 
and you demand my death I accept your sentence 
for which you have make choice of another hand 
it seem i not deserve to die by you 
I shall not go to exchange blow for blow 
I owe he more respect that fight for you 
and since it be your honour which he fight for 
I will open he my breast in his adore 
your hand from which I will welcome my destruction 

if the just violence of a fatal duty 
which make i to pursue thou against my will 
prescribe unto thy love so hard a law 
that thou will not defend thyself against he 
that fight for i take head lest thou forget 
that both thy life and glory fall together 
and howsoever Roderigo have live 
be slay he will be think a vanquish man 
honour be dear once than I be to you 
when in my father blood you imbrue your hand 
it make you then in spite of your affection 
renounce the hope of ere enjoy i 
but now you value it so little that 
you care not who it be that conquer you 
see how unseasonable your virtue be 
why be you valiant once and be not now 
be you so only to do i a outrage 
or will you be so cruel to my father 
that have conquer he you will submit 
yourself to any hand no Roderigo 
defend thy honour though thou slight thy life 

my honour can need any defence 
more than it have already he that can 
defeat the moor and kill the count of gormas 
have not a enemy beside to fear 
no no Roderigo know whatever you think 
how in this fight to die and save his honour 
that none shall dare to think he want courage 
only they will say he do adore Cimena 
he will not live have deserve her hate 
how he give way unto the cruel fate 
which force his mistress to pursue his death 
Shee ask his head and his great heart conceive 
he shall commit a crime if he deny it 
to acquit his honour he renounce his love 
to acquit his mistress he renounce his life 
thus shall you see my glory in this combat 
shine more than ere it do my willing death 
shall have this honour that no man but I 
can for the wrong do to you satisfy 

since nor thy love nor honour can prevail 
to hold thou from thy ruin dear Roderigo 
if ere I love thou I conjure thou now 
to do thy best if for no other end 
to free i from don Sancho let i not 
be give up to the object of my loathe 
what shall I say more go defend thyself 
and if thy love be not congeal to ice 
be victor where Cimena be the price 
adieu this last word make i blush for shame 

be there a enemy now that I can fear 
Moor and castilian or whatever you be 
who Aragon or Spain think valiant 
appear and make one army of yourselves 
my soul encourage thus shall throw i on you 
for so sweet hope what be it I dare not meet with 

be it to i you come now Leonora 

madam I come to testify the joy 
I feel to see your heart at rest 

my heart 
can rest come to a heart that be fill with grief 

if love do live on hope and die with it 
Roderigo can trouble you any long 
you know the combat where he be engage 
by his Cimena there he must or die 
or be her husband but whatever happen 
whether he live or die your hope be dead 

but how can thou assure i it be dead 
if upon these condition Roderigo 
do entertain the combat have not I 
invention enough to break it off 
love the sweet author of my punishment 
can teach the wit of lover many slight 

hope you to breed a discontent between they 
which a father death can Cimena show 
by her conduct of this affair that hate 
cause not her pursuit it be true she have get 
the combat grant but to take her part 
who have she choose not a expert man 
or one already famous for his action 
don Sancho serve her turn who till this time 
do never put on arm she love in he 
his small experience this her sudden choice 
must make you see she seek for such a combat 
as may enforce her duty to be silent 
and yet assure Roderigo conquest 

I see it well enough and yet my heart 
strive with cimena who shall most adore he 
what have I best resolve on Leonora 

madam bethink yourself of who you be bear 
a king heaven owe you and you love a subject 

no no my thought be off from their first object 
I love not Roderigo as a gentleman 
he that I love now be the valiant Cid 
the master of two king and yet I mean 
to overcome myself not for the fear of blame 
but that I will disturb so fair a flame 
and though they will now crown he yet I shall not 
resume the gift which I have give another 
then since thou say roderigoe victory 
be certain let we go give he to Cimena 
and thou that know how far my love have run 
come see i finish what I have begin 

what shall I do Elvira all my hope 
be lose and I have nothing leave but fear 
I dare not give consent to my own wish 
I have cause two rival to take arm for i 
whatever happen sorrow be my lot 
for think the best I can of fate obtain 
my father be unrevenged or lover slay 

from both side you will find reason of comfort 
either you have revenge or Roderigo 
however destiny dispose of you 
it save your honour and provide you a husband 

what the object of my hate or of my anger 
Roderigo or my father murderer 
from this or that I must expect a husband 
die in the blood of he I hold most dear 
I fear the issue worse than any death 
go vengeance or my love that trouble i 
thou have not sweet I be sure to make i amend 
and thou the powerful mover of that fate 
which do i all this violence determine 
this combat equal without advantage 
that neither be the victor or the vanquish 

that be to handle you with too much cruelty 
if when the fight be do you shall be bind 
a new to demand justice and never leave 
with rigour to pursue the man you love 
no it be better that his unmatched valour 
shall get he victory and silence you 
and that the king accord to his law 
shall force you to comply with your own wish 

do think though he be conqueror that I will 
yield myself his my duty be too strong 
and my loss over great he may overcome 
don Sancho easy but not so soon 
the glory of Cimena though a monarch 
have promise i unto his victory 
my honour rather than I will be his prize 
shall raise he up a thousand enemy 

take heed lest heaven for this strange pride of you 
suffer you not to be revenge at all 
what mean you to refuse this happiness 
that you may when you please sit down with honour 
what be it you will pretend what can you hope 
will your lover death restore your father to you 
or be your father death so small a mischief 
that you will heap up loss on loss grief upon grief 
well do continue in this stubborn humour 
you scarce deserve the man they have destine for you 
and heaven be weary of its too much favour 
in stead of he will wed you to don Sancho 

the grief Elvira I sustain already 
need not thy fatal augury to augment they 
I will if possible avoid they both 
if not Roderigo have my best of wish 
not that my love incline i more to he 
but lest he fail I shall be don sancho 
the thought of that make i to wish he well 
what be this Elvira see it be do already 

at your foot madam I present this sword 

what that yet reak with Roderigo blood 
traitor how dare thou come into my sight 
when thou have ravish from i all I love 
Shine now at full my love thou need not fear 
my father be satisfy one only blow 
have to my honour give security 
to my soul despair to my love liberty

speak to i curse murderer of that Heros 
which I do most adore go thou have slay he 
perfidious for otherwise that man 
can never fall by such a hand as thou 

but hear he madam 

what will thou have i hear 
can I doubt when my eye be satisfy 
I have obtain the mischief which I seek for 
and my just suit have have too good success 
pardon dear love it be bloody cruelty 
think though a lover yet I be a daughter 
if on thy blood I have revenge my father 
for thy revenge I will exhaust my own 
my soul have nothing now that shall retain it 
it shall go after thou to ask it pardon 
and thou that think to obtain i by his death 
disloyal minister of my cruel fate 
hope nothing at my hand thou have do i 
no service only hasten on my death 

it be a strange passion will not give i hear 

what will thou have i hear thou while with boast 
thou paint out to i my own fatal crime 
and his misfortune that thy cruel story 
may kill i in thy sight no I can die 
without thy help my soul can find out death 
instruct by no aid but her own mischief 

sir I need not now dissemble any long 
what never art of i can hide from you 
I love you know yet to revenge my father 
I will proscribe the head I hold so dear 
by that your majesty may easy see 
I mean my love shall give place to my duty 
in fine Roderigo be dead his death have change 
she who be once his mortal enemy 
to a afflict lover that revenge 
I to my father ought and to my love 
these tear which now I shed don Sancho have 
in take of my part quite ruine i 
and yet for do so I be make his prize 
sir if kind pity ever move a king 
now of your grace revoke this cruel law 
though he have slay the man I love so dear 
I will give he all I have for his reward 
so he will leave i to myself and that 
I may bewail the time I have to live 
my father and my lover in a cloister 

now you perceive she love sir and not think 
it be such a crime to a vow her lawful love 

sweet heart mistake not Roderigo live 
don Sancho have make thou a false report 

sir not by i but by she too much heat 
she be deceive for have she give i leave 
I shall have tell she that her noble lover 
when he disarm i bid i banish fear 
for that say he I will rather leave the conquest 
uncertain than I will spill a drop of blood 
that be venture for Cimena but since I 
be by my duty call to attend the king 
go you and entertain she in my stead 
and at her foot offer your life and sword 
which when I come to do the sword deceive she 
with which see i return she think that I 
have be the victor present her anger 
betray her love with such impatience 
that I have not a minute audience 
for my part though I be a vanquish man 
and though the interest of my love be great 
yet I repute myself in this my loss 
to be a gainer love my distress 
which bring so fair a flame so good success 

you must not be ashamed of such a love 
Cimena or seek mean to disavow it 
your honour be disengage your duty quit 
your father satisfy what will you more 
must you still put Roderigo in new danger 
you see heaven otherwise dispose of he 
and since that it have do so much for he 
do you too something for yourself and take 
he for your husband that I offer you 
and who I know you love 

come Cimena 
dry thy eye and receive with a glad heart 
this noble conqueror from thy princess hand 

great sir be not offend if before you 
the duty which I owe to love do cast i 
here at her foot I come not to demand 
the prize which I have win but once more yet 
to offer you my life my love shall not 
or plead the combat law or the king will 
if all that be do can appease your anger 
tell i what mean be leave to satisfy 
must I encounter yet a thousand rival 
travail from one end of the earth to the other 
or force a camp myself or rout a army 
if at length I may expiate my crime 
I shall attempt all this but if your honour 
be still inexorable and nothing can 
appease it but my death behold my head 
I cast it at your foot take it yourself 
and arm no other hand for your revenge 
since none but you can do it yet let my death 
be all my punishment and let i not 
be banish from your memory but say 
if any time you call to mind my pain 
have he not love i he have not be slay 

rise Roderigo sir I must needs say 
my love have show itself too much for i 
now to deny it Roderigo have 
such virtue as I know not how to hate 
and you be my king I can but obey you 
but be there here any appearance of 
a marriage if it be it be a sad one 
that one day shall begin and end my mourning 
that have lay my father in his grave 
I shall lay Roderigo in my bed 
that be to hold intelligence with his murderer 
and soil my honour with eternal shame 

time often make that lawful which at present 
seem not to be so Roderigo have win thou 
and his thou must be but though his valour 
have make you his yet I shall do you wrong 
so soon to give he the reward he fight for 
take if you will a year to end your mourning 
in the mean time Roderigo shall take arm 
and have under his command my army 
shall carry back the war unto the moor 
which they bring hither that they all may tremble 
at this brave name of Cid which they have give thou 
they have call thou lord already and they will 
make thou their king but let not Roderigo 
thy great exploit take off thy loyalty 
return if possible more worthy of she 
and let thy deed set such a price upon thou 
that she may court thy marriage as a honour 

for my Cimena sir and for your service 
what can you bid i do I will accomplish 
and though I hardly can endure her absence 
yet be the hope you give sufficient happiness 

rely upon thy valour and my promise 
and now thou have thy mistress heart already 
this point of honour which be the last thing 
let time over come thy valour and thy king
