what snarl my dear Democritus how be it 
you be a courtier grow I hear 

no sir 
that be too deep a mystery for i to profess 
I spend my own revenue only I have 
a itch humour to see fashion 

and what have you observe since you come hither 

why they do hold here the same maxim still 
that to dissemble be the way to live 
but promotion hang all upon one chain 
and that be of gold he that intend to climb 
must get up by the link and those be tie 
together with the thread of my lord favour 

so sir 

and all desire to live long and healthy 
but ambition and luxury will not permit it 

I hope you do not share in their desire 

there be other preposterous deal too 
for nature can find herself among they 
there be such effeminacy in both sex 
they can be distinguish asunder 
and for your time and season of all age 
your best astrologer can discern they 
not spring from autumn you shall have a lady 
who cheek be like a screw and every wrinkle 
will look like a furrow yet with a garnish 
be so fill up and plaster that it look 
as fresh as a new paint tavern only 

hold there you will run yourself out of breath else 
and now resolve i of the lord Phylautus 
be all that true that be report of he 

who he the most besot on his beauty 
he study nothing but to court himself 
no music but the harmony of his limb 
no work of art but his own symmetry 
allure his sense to admiration 
and then he come forth so bathe in perfume 
have you no sense to guide you but your nose 
you will think he a muskcat he smell as rank 
as the extreme unction of two funeral 

my sense will note be able to endure he 

such man as smell so I suspect their favour 

be none his friend to tell he of his fault 

there want not some that seek to flatter he 
for great man vice be esteem as virtue 

o they be still in fashion in they 
a wry neck be a comely precedent 
disorder disagreement in their life 
and manner be think regular their action 
be still authentic if it be receive 
to be illiterate be a point of state 
but the worst thing which I dislike in he 
which he do more by word then action 
he give out that the lady dote upon he 
and that he can command they at his pleasure 
and swear there be scarce a honest woman 

How 

it be not well to say so but by this light 
I be of his mind too 

you be deceive 
there be a thousand chaste 

there be a age 
when Juno be a maid and Jove have no beard 
when miserable Atlas be not oppress 
with such a sort of deity and each 
dine by himself before usher and page 
swarm so and banquet and your masque come up 
ride in coach visit and title 
so many play and Puritan preach 
that woman may be chaste now it be impossible 
now shall I find such a prodigious faith 
I will honour it with a sacrifice 

it be ill 
to be incredulous when charity 
exact your belief but let that pass 
what will you say if I find out a mean 
to cure he of his folly 

then I pronounce 
the destruction of bedlam and all mad folk 
shall be thy patient 

nay I will do it 
I will make he in love and do it 

that be a cure 
worse than any disease I can as soon 
believe a fire may be extinct with oil 
or a fever cool with drink of sack 

suspend your judgement till I confirm you 

no more stand by here come the parasite 
that be Narcissus and this be his echo 

what be he 

one that feed all man humour that feed he 
can apprehend their jest before they speak they 
and with a force laughter play the midwife 
to bring they forth and carry still in store 
a plaudite when they break wind or urine 
he fit his master right although he never 
take measure of he and though he have not be 
far from home yet will lie like a traveller 
he will rather vex you with officiousness 
than you shall pass unsaluted he business 
be only to be busy and his tongue be still walk 
though himself be one of the worst moveable 
a confuse lump leaven with knavery 
stand by a little and let we hear his discourse

like some unthankful hospital or college 
that have forget their founder

beside it be not a age to be honest in

I mean to make the benefit of my place therefore 
and when I have do I will fain see all your artist 
your politician with their instrument 
and plummet of wit sound the depth of i 

it lie not in the reach of man to fathom it 

be I set in a place of justice now 
they will admire i how I shall become it 
cough on the bench of state sit in my nightcap 
strike out a apophthegm out of my beard

must marshal the dish put the stool in rank 
see the wood set upon the carriage 
sharpen the knife all these witness my care

the strange activity that some man have 
to dispatch business

and all the poet gape to receive it

in the same manner do I 
upon the husher the clark and the butler

and tedious encomium of himself 
let you and I walk a turn in the garden 

you be the only garden of my delight 
and I your dear Adonis honour lady 

ardelio tell i how this suit become i 

exact well sir without controversy 
and you wear it as neat 

nay I have 
a reasonable good tailor I hope he have not 
survey i so long but he know my dimension 
I think I may venture in the presence with it 

in the presence ay and love be in the presence 
you will thrust Ganymede out of his office 

what think you gentleman 

we all do wish 
your beauty or your vanity be less 
for by this mean that which will else commend you 
prove your disgrace you take the edge of praise off 
be due to you by too much whet it 

I shall prove too injurious to myself 
shall I pass over with a slight regard 
this building nature have solemnize 
with such magnificence to which I owe 
the love of lady and their daily present 
their hourly solicitation with letter 
their entertainment when I come their plot 
they lay to view i which shall I recount 
it will puzzle my arithmetic and to answer 
their unjust desire will ask the labour 
of some ten stallion 

and make all jade of they 

you be the centre of all woman love then 

it be true I have a strange attractive power 
over your female do you never hear of 
three goddess that strive on Ida hill 
naked before a shepherd for a ball 
with a inscription let the fair have it 

and what of those 

bring they all three before i 
if I surprise they not all at first dash 
if they fall not together by the ear for i 
nay if they run not mad and follow i 
as if they be drink with a love potion 
never trust a prognosticator again 

but how if you shall chance to meet Diana 
take heed of she it be a testy girl 
a profess virgin Phil it be my ambition 
to meet with she to bathe my limb with she 
in the same well shoot in her bow dance with she 
and get the foremost of her troop with child 
and turn the rape on jupiter 

fine i'faith 

it seem that you be of opinion 
there be no text of womankind so holy 
but may be corrupt though a deity 

ardelio tell i what thou do think of they 

who I hang i shall I be question 
now for my faith concern article 
of woman chastity I shall be burn 
for a rank heretic I believe none of they 

but I think otherwise and can justify it 
what if I bring you now unto a beauty 
as glorious as the sun but in desire 
cold as the middle region of the air 
and free from all reflection of lust 

but shall I speak with she and tempt she to it 

you shall converse with she and she shall feed 
your sense with such discursive influence 
and a voice sweet than the lydian tune 
jove will bow down his ear to yet her blood 
shall run as cold as julip through her vein 
the springtide of her youth shall swell with more 
delight than there be drop in April yet she 
as chaste as Salmacis amid the stream 
her eye shall sparkle like the diamond 
and be as pure her kiss soft and melt 
as the south wind but undefiled as heaven 
and you shall feel the elemental fire 
of her unspotted love and grieve and swear 
she be so celestial and divine a creature 
that be only hot in her effect not nature 

why such a one will I converse withal 
the conquest will be great shall I see she 

I will bring you to she 

he have a strong belief 
I have no such confidence she may be Lucrece 
and he a foolish Collatine to brag of she 
but most of they in play fast and loose 
will cheat a oracle I have a creature 
before these courtier lick their lip at she 
I will trust a wanton baggage in the wind 

this lady be sister and 〈◊〉 mistress 
yet both unknown to he some few year since 
her father jealous of my love because 
I be a gentleman of no great fortune 
send she away and charge she by a oath 
to marry none till seven year be expire 
six part of which be go yet she remain 
constant to what she promise though his death 
have partly quit she to live in her sight 
and not enjoy she be a heavenly torment 
but unsufferable I must live apart 
till the prefix minute be expire 
in the mean time I will work by some good mean 
to win his love and draw he from his folly 
but first by he I will try her constancy 
I must prepare she for his entertainment 
because she will admit no company 
nor will be know to any but myself 
Come sir let we go by that which shall ensue 
you shall affirm what I relate be true 

it be a dull age this same cast not her eye 
on man of worth captain and commander 
victorious abroad be vanquish at home 
with poverty and disgrace they look as bad 
as Brutus when he meet his evil genius 
worse than they have be fright from the ruin 
of Isis temple and you sir for your part 
that have be bring up under i at my elbow 
a daily witness unto all my project 
that may have get experience enough 
to cozen a whole state if they have trust you 
now to be want to yourself wear out 
no name or title but on post and trencher 
and door score with a coal in stead of chalk 
be my hope come to this 

what shall I do 
I have no thrive way to lie and flatter 
nor have I such dexterity of wit 
as you have bless be heaven to convert 
black into white 

nay if you have no will 
nor power to free yourself you must resolve 
to stick in the dirt still 

nor can I promise 
the death of any by the star I have 
no rich man funeral to solemnize 
that leave a guilt ring for my legacy 
and his old velvet jerkin to survive he 
I have no secret boil within my breast 
for which I be fear no suit in law to follow 
no accusation against a great man 
no house to let to farm no tender wife 
to prostitute or skill to corrupt other 
and sleep amid their wanton dialogue 

I cry you mercy you will fain be style 
a honest politic fool see all man turn 
serve but your own so leave off to be good 
for what be now account to be good 
take a good lawyer or a good attorney 
a citizen that be a good chapman 
in a good sense what be they I will know 
why a good gamester or a good courtier 
be it for their honest deal take a good poet 
and if he write not bawdy line and rapture 
I will not give a pin for he 

will you have i 
act the plagiary and seek preferment 
to be the drunken bard of some black stew 
and think my destiny well satisfy 
when my shame feed i and at length expect 
a legacy bequeath i from some bawd 
in lieu of my old service or accord 
to the proportion of my hernia 

well I perceive that I must once more take you 
to my protection which if I do 
I will teach you better rule you shall no more 
commit your misery to lose paper 
nor court my lord with panegyric nor make 
strange anagram of my lady you shall not need 
to deal for stale commodity nor yet 
send forth your privy bill without a seal 
to free you from your lodging where you have 
lie in most part of the vacation 
you shall no long run in score with your hostess 
for brown toast and tobacco but you shall leave 
your open stand at the end of lane 
or your close covert in tobaccoshop 
where you give strict attendance like a sergeant 
until some antedate country cloak 
pass by who you most impudent may 
assault to borrow twelve penny but bear up 
stiff and with the best 

how shall that be do 

we will not call Tiresias from the dead 
to show we how as he do once Ulysses 
you must resolve to learn virtue from other 
fortune from i 

for that I will make no scruple 

I have a bird in the wind I will fly thou on he 
he shall be thy adventure thy first quarry 

what be he 

a golden one that drop his feather 
that have receive his patrimony give money 
for all acquaintance when he first come up 
his only search be for prime courtesan 
and those he entertain for mistress 
only sometime to drink a health to they 
the lady too will use he for a cool 
but they suspect his silence yet he use 
their name and title as familiar 
as he have buy they thou shall hook he in 
and crack he like a nut 

be he not the son 
to the rich usurer that die so late 

the same that heap up money by the bushel 
and now this study how to scatter it 
his father walk to see what become of it 
and that be his torment after death 

when shall I see he 

he be to meet i here within this hour 
then take you a occasion to pass by 
and I will whisper to he private 
and praise thou beyond Pirrhus or Hannibal 
you must talk and look big it will be the grace on it 

what shall I turn a roarer 

any thing 
broker or pandar cheater or lifter 
and steal like a lacedaemonian 
observe what I do and fill up the scene 
how now what news

how five or six 

yes sir and they pretend 
great business

and their cloak seem to have be the cover 
of some old monument 

they be my Gibeonite 
be come to traffic with i some design 
be now on foot and this be our exchange time 
these be my old projector and they make i 
the superintendent of their business 
but still they shoot two or three bow too short 
for want of money and adventurer 
they have as many demur as the chancery 
and hatch more strange imagination 
than any dream philosopher one of they 
will undertake the make of baysalt 
for a penny a bushel to serve the state 
another dream of build waterwork 
dry of fen and marsh like the Dutchman 
another strive to raise his fortune from 
decay bridge and will exact a tribute 
from alehouse and signpost some there be 
will make a thoroughfare for the whole kingdom 
and office where nature shall give account 
for all she take and send into the world 
but they be bear in a unlucky hour 
for some unfortunate mischance or other 
still come athwart they well I must into they 
and feast they with new hope it will be good sport 
to hear how they dispure it pro and con 
in the mean time Autolicus prepare 
to meet my courtier

who name I be loath shall clog my memory 
they strive for i as the seven grecian city

How get you rid of they

to go with none of they make a excuse 
to avoid their troublesome visitation

it be good counsel 

and I will confirm all with a jointure 

well 
it be do 
I will tell you more of she she be one 
who tender year have not as yet aspire 
the height of wickedness but may be bring 
to commit venery in her own language 
and be content with one man have not robe 
young boves of their voice know not her slight 
and double nor her labyrinth through which 
the minotaur her husband shall never track she 
can indite with art nor give a censure 
upon the line be send she have no agent 
no factor pensioner or champion 
nor have her tear fix in their station 
to flow at her command and so confirm 
her perjury not large in her expense nor one 
that when she be dress will call a conventicle 
of young and old to pass their judgement on she 
as if her life be gage upon the matter 
nor carry a Ephemerides about with she 
to which she ascribe your fork destiny 
nor be her body crazy neither take she 
physic for state nor will rise up at midnight 
to eat her oyster and drink wine till lust 
dance in her vein and till the house turn round 
and she discern not betwixt her head and tail 
nor hold strange intelligence abroad 
to furnish her discourse with neither take she 
her journey once a year to the bath nor be 
so learned as to judge betwixt your poet 
which of they write best and fluent nor yet 
be grow a antiquary to decide 
matter in heraldry she have no fucus 
to catch your lip like birdlime nor yet use 
restorative more than the help of nature 
I will speak the noble word I can of you 
so many woman on a mere report 
do fall in love with man before they see they 

nay when I see she I be sure of she 
I have a little haste I be to meet 
a countess at the exchange within this hour 
beside I have a catalogue of business 
if I can think on it so I take my leave 
farewell gentleman 

farewell sir 

farewell sweet m coxcomb 
this wench I so commend be my daughter 
and if my skill not fail i she I will make 
a stale to take this courtier in a brake 

be there no mean to absolve you of your oath 
the blame on i let the bright day no long 
envy the darkness that conceal such beauty 
you be no votary and yet force your youth 
to such a strict and solitary life 
which other bind by vow can perform 
I wonder at the temper of your blood 
so differ from your sex when your old woman 
do burn with lustful thought as with a fever 
yet you go on in the old track of virtue 
now overgrow with seed of vice 

sweet hear i 
it be a penance that I live reserve 
because my love to you be make abortive 
but when due time shall perfect in her womb 
and bring it forth anew unto the birth 
I will surrender up myself and it 
to your dispose let it suffice the while 
I be no haunter of your public meeting 
no entertainer nor no visitor 
nor do I ever trust my wander eye 
to view the glitter vanity of the world 
nor ever yet do sit a guilty witness 
to a lascivious and untune discourse 
sound to their fantastic action 

but I must begone favour at your hand 
and suffer no repulse

and you must use all art for his content 
with music song and dance such as be 
the stirrer of hot appetite

and idle wretch to cast away thy hope 
upon a pandarly profession 
or do thou think that I can be corrupt 
to personate a strumpet dalliance 
I grieve for thou be go henceforth I will live 
immure for ever as a Anchorist 
from he and thou since thou have wrong my love 

mistake i not the difference betwixt the pole 
be not so great as betwixt i and baseness 
nor be it a sinister intent to make 
your favour stale and common as a drug 
which be so dear to i that both the Indies 
be not of equal value to engross 
but for a noble and peculiar end 

This seem to i a paradox

thy face the table where love write 
a thousand story of delight 
make it all over smooth and plain 
but see you shadow it with disdain 
weave a net out of thy hair 
a subtle net that may ensnare 
such fond soul as shall aspire 
to come near the holy fire 
of thy eye which be of late 
by Cupid torch illuminate 
use all the delusive art 
that may captivate his heart 

what be your intent in this 

I will have he punish

on all your sex and you shall vindicate they 
when he be plunge in love irrevocable

sure her intelligence arrive too late 
about the last new fashion or the crime

some other grand solecism in her tailor

some scurvy lady put it in her head 
to practise a state melancholy that first 
begin in a imperious revolt 
and frown and contempt of her own husband 
and what she may recover by the law 
in case of separation or a nullity 
which she already have take counsel of 
come it be so

of my perfection dote upon himself 
I can plot against he prithee Quartilla 
how long have thou be chaste 

this chastity

clean out of use since I be first a maid

from boy to lad and as I grow in year 
I write my venery in a large volume

and imitate his fashion suck from he 
the quintessence of education

will season a tragedy nay more there be 
a natural grace in all his action

and do the half pomado play at gleek 
and promise more than ere he will perform 
and never part with a penny to a tradesman 
until he have beat he for it shall walk the street 
as gingerly as if he fear to hurt 
the ground he go on while his cast down eye 
hold commerce with his leg shall utter nothing 
whatever he think yet swear it whatever it be 
nay more he shall vow love to all he see 
and damn himself to make they believe it 
shall fawn on all man yet let his friend perish 
for what he spend in one day on his punk

to bear the weighty burden of your fame 

and it be all true they say 

that you be most fair 
a most exact accomplish gentile lord 
not to be contradict it be a truth 
above all truth for where be any truth 
that be agree upon by all but this 

such be the force of beauty there be nothing 
can please without it and whoever have it 
as there be few be adjudge happy in it 

all this be true 

then he that have a pure 
and sublimed beauty it be a thing sensible 
and can be deny must be admire 
and free from all detraction 

this be true 

he that excel in valour wit or honour 
he that be rich or virtuous may be envy 
but love be the reward of beauty no object 
surprise more the eye all that delight we 
we ascribe beauty to it 

all this be true 

look high or low it be true why be the star 
fix in their orb but to adorn the heaven 
and we adore their beauty more than light 
look on the art how they tend all to beauty 
it be their only end he that build a house 
strive not so much for use as ornament 
nor do your orator compose a speech 
with lesser care to have it elegant 
then move and your limner do observe 
the trim and dress more than the rule of paint 

all truth and oracle 

look on a fair ship 
and you will say it be very beautiful 
a general rejoice in the title 
of a fair army I will come near to you 
who be think worthy to be deify 
but such as be find beautiful for this cause 
jove take up Ganymede from Ida hill 
to fill he wine and go a hunt with he

that be so guide that he can not stray 
how now have thou obtain in thy request

to tell you true I take a more delight 
in the perplexity of woo they 
than the enjoy 

she be as I tell you 

if she be otherwise than I conceive 
a pox on the augury 

but hark you sir 
you need not be know who you be

dispense with house keep so you allow she 
to keep her state her coach and the fashion 
these thing she mean to article beforehand

of word he have 
but you must do the deed 

ay so I will 
for look you sir I have the several grace 
of four nation in imitation 
of the four element that make a man 
concur to my perfection

and quick lose she be very humoursome 

I will fit she then I be as humoursome 
as herself I have all the four humour 
I be hot I be cold 
I be dry and I be moist 

I must be like the satyr then and leave you 
if you be hot and cold 

o you mistake i 
I be not in my ambition 
I be dry in my jest 
I be cold in my charity 
and moist in my luxury

not so much in the nature of a servant 
as her companion for it be the fashion 
among your great one to have those wait on they

what to a woman it be a solecism 
in nature for you know Cupid be a boy 
and will you tire he like a senator 
and put a declamation in his mouth 
it be a mere madness in you here they come 
see what a majesty she bear go meet she 

stand by it be my happiness invite i

of wealth and parentage join to your virtue 
that I may just suspect your disdain 
but by my hope I do not court your fortune

I will leave you 

lady my preface be to know your name 

Faustina sir 

I may be happy in you 
I have a sister somewhere of that name 
that in her youth do promise such a feature 
and hope of future excellence she have 
a beauty mix with majesty will draw 
from the beholder love and reverence 
and I do ill methinks with unchaste thought 
to sin against her memory this task 
will I be rid of but I will venture lady 
you be not blind I conceive 

no sir I have not 
yet see a thing so strong sensible 
to hurt my eyesight 

then I hope you can 
take notice of a gentleman good part 
without a periphrasis 

what be that 

a figure 
needless at this time to explain my desert 
so easy and apparent to be see 

I dare not envy nor detract where worth 
Do challenge due relation of respect 
nor be my wit so curious to make 
a gloss or comment on your quality 

it be too much labour it be a task will dull 
the edge of rhetoric to describe they right 
nor will I have they dwell upon your tongue 
but fix in your thought there let they move 
till they meet in conjunction with your love 
nature will boast so sweet a sympathy 

I shall be sorry if my understanding 
move in so poor a circle as your praise 
I have not leisure to take notice of it 
be this all you have to say 

no I have more 
but love be slow to dictate to my vow 
and yet those sacred and divine impulsion 
strike true than my heart and by his power 
that have inflame i here I swear I love you 

your oath and love be make of the same air 
both die in their conception quick utter 
and as easy not believe 

nay now you wrong 
my true intent 

suppose I grant you love i 
what will you infer 

that you shall speak the like 
and with the same affection 

if your love 
be not a bawd unto some base desire 
I do return the like 

I know not how 
you may interpret it but sure the law 
and the command of nature be no baseness 
a thing that love himself have dignify 
and in his rape confess the god of love 
the great of the two who king have stoop to 
we be allow to enjoy some steal delight 
so we be secret in it for it be set down 
by such as in this art have skilful be 
we be not forbid to act but to be see 

upon these term I do deny you love i 
it be lust that flatter sin make love a god 
and to get freedom for his theft they give 
madness the title of a deity 
for how can that be love which seek the ruin 
of his own object and the thing belove 
no true love be a pure affection 
that give the soul transparent and not that 
that be conversant in beastly appetite 

tell not i of your philosophical love 
I be a fool to linger woman denial 
be but a easy cruelty and they 
love to be force sometime 

pray know your distance 

come you dissemble and you all be willing 

to what 

there be none of you but feel the smart 
of a libidinous sting else wherefore be 
those bait and strong allurement to entice we 
wherefore be all your sleek and your curl 
crisp and painting and your skin make soft 
and your face smooth with ointment than your gate 
confine to measure and compose by art 
beside the wanton petulancy of your eye 
that scatter flame with doubtful motion 
unless it be to prostitute your beauty 

I will give account for none sir but myself 
and that I will speak before my virgin zone 
shall be unty by any unchaste hand 
nature shall suffer dissolution 
but whatever other be methinks your worth 
shall not pretend to a ignoble action 

now by this light I think you will moralize i 

it be my desire you shall go better from i 
than you come hither you have some good part 
but they be all exterior and these breed 
a self conceit a affectation in you 
and what more odious some applaud you in it 
as parasite but wise man laugh at you 
will you employ those gift that may commend you 
and add a grace to goodness have you any 
in the pursuit of vice that render you 
worthy of nought but pity 

I come as to 
a whore but shall return as from a saint 

then leave to prosecute the foggy vapour 
of a gross pleasure that involve the soul 
in cloud of infamy I wonder one 
so complete in the structure of his body 
shall have his mind so disproportion 
the lineament of virtue quite deface 

I be subdue she have convert i 
I see within the mirror of her goodness 
the foulness of my folly sweet instruct i 
and I will style thou my Aegeria 

it be a shame that man that have the seed 
of virtue in he spring unto glory 
shall make his soul degenerous with sin 
and slave to luxury to drown his spirit 
in lees of sloth to yield up the weak day 
to wine to lust and banquet 

here be a woman 
the soul of Hercules have get into she 
she have a spirit be more masculine 
than the first gender how her speech have fill i 
with love and wonder sweet lady proceed 

I will have you proceed and seek for fame 
in brave exploit like those that snatch their honour 
out of the talent of the roman eagle 
and pull her golden feather in the field 
those be brave man not you that stay at home 
and dress yourself up like a pageant 
with thousand antic and exotic shape 
that make a idol of a lookingglass 
spruce yourself two hour by it with such 
gesture and posture that a wait wench 
will be ashamed of you and then come forth 
to adore your mistress fan or tell your dream 
ravish a ●●sse from her white glove and then 
compare it with her hand to praise her gown 
her tire and discourse of the fashion 
make discovery which lady paint which not 
which lord play best at gleek which best at racket 
these be fine element 

you have redeem i 
and with the sunny beam of your good counsel 
disperse the mist that hang so heavy on i 
and that you may perceive it take effect 
I will to the war immediate 

why then 
I must confess I shall love you the better 

I will begin it in your happy omen 
but first confess that you have vanquish i 
and if I shall overcome a enemy 
yield you the trophy of the victory 

please you walk in the while 

I shall attend you 
henceforth I will strive to fly the sight of pleasure 
as of a harpy or a basilisk 
and when she flatter seal my ear with wax 
take from that boat that row with a deaf oar 
from the sweet tune of the sicilian shore 

be you for the war indeed

to go among they like your volunteer 
that fright worse at home with debt and danger 
travel abroad in the summer to see service 
and then come home in the winter to drink sack 
I be none of those I will hardly trust myself 
in the artillery yard for fear of mischief 

mr Trimalehio you be young and lusty 
full of ambitious thought 

it be true indeed 
that I be grow ambitious of honour 
and mean to purchase it 

but with no danger 
of life and hope 

I mean to hazard a limb for it 

why whither be you go 

to the leaguer 
upon the same employment that Hercules 
do once against the Amazon 

and I 
will stay at home and write their annal for they 

stay all at home and hug your ignominy 
and while we spoil the enemy may you 
be pile by pimp cheater entrench upon you 
let bawd and their issue join with you marry 
with whore and let projector rifle for you 
and so I leave you

a score of Danae wench of delight 
within this castle if I list to show you 
where Circe keep her residence that shall 
if she but lay her rod upon your neck

with the mystery of your iniquity 

I do embrace thy league and return the hand 
of friendship to thy better understanding 
I will discover the situation of the place 
it be of itself a island a mere swan nest 
which have Ulysses see he will prefer 
before his Ithaca and he who fate 
shall bless to vanquish it he may deserve 
the name of a new conqueror it have 
the credit to be style the terra florida 
of the best beauty in the town my friend

and be not I the lady of the manor 
and who shall dare to question i I hope 
I shall be able to defend my fort 
from the invasion of the paint staff 
or the tempestuous paper engine safe 
as a mole in a trench and work at high midnight 
when their wise head be lay we will raise the spirit 
of our dead pleasure use the benefit 
of youth and dance our orgy by the moonlight

commodity as any all that we utter 
be in dark shop or else by candlelight 

we be become the envy of citizen

and that she have misplace her affection 
when I have wrack the wrong on my corrival 
Trimalchio look to thyself be he remove

there be a difference I will straight to the tavern 
and when I once be hight with good canary 
I pronounce he dead that affront my fury 

turn out of service the next turn will be 
under the gallow and have a ballad make of i 
the corruption of a cashier servingman 
be the generation of a thief I scare 
my fate point i not out to so good fortune 
my bulk will not serve i to take a purse 
the best thing I be fit for be a tapster

tavern and bawdyhouse we can imagine

if I shall tell you all the passage 
at the leaguer 

thither we come to meet you 
and you be go 

and then at the justice 

be you before the justice 

it be such a story 
will fill a chronicle 

we meet with a party of the enemy 
take all we have from we and then it cost we 
forty shilling in fee at the justice 

that be hard deal 

the old boy and I 
grow to be kin at last 

he make i sure 
to my mistress before we part 

how 
by what strange accident 

honest ardelio 
and Misellanio we be all together 
in rebellion and quit by a letter 
that come from my mistress 

be it possible 
and Miscellanio turn traitor 

what 

will have your mistress from you think the letter 
be send for his sake 

that I be sure he do not 

Threaten and swear that he will fight for she 

if he be weary of his life he may 
why what can he pretend to she 

I know not 
what have pass between they but I be sure 
he have be practise at the fence school 
to get a trick to kill you 

he kill i 
I will kill he first I fight by geometry 

how by geometry 

yes sir here I hold 
my rapier mark i in a diameter 
to my body that be the centre conceive i 

your body be the centre very good 

and my hilt part of the circumference 

well sir 

which hilt be big than my body 

then your whole body 

yes at such a distance 
and he shall never hit i while he live 

where do you learn this at the leaguer 

no 
no by this light it be my own invention 
I learn it in my travel 

very strange 
you be a scholar 

no I will not be 
suspect of such a crime for a million 
but it be no sin to know geometry 
and by that I can tell we shall never fight 

not fight at all 

I will show you in geometry 
two parallel can never meet now we two 
be parallel for so we be that be 
equal in wit and valour can never meet 
and if we never meet we shall never fight 

to prove your axiom false see where he come 

I do defy he 

hang thou bluster son 
of Aeolus defy i I will tie up thy breath 
in bag and sell it for a penny a ounce 

draw sir

it be best for i to hide i in my cabin 

Will you resign your mistress 

no I scorn it 

unless you will have she take away by force 

I see this can be end without blood 

captain a word with you 

what say you sir 

I be afraid he come with the black art 

how you afraid do not say so for shame 

he have lie with a old witch at Sweden 
and be grow stick free 

fie that you shall say so 

I will be resolve of that before I fight 

why do you think that witch have such power 

I marry do I I have know one of they 
do more than that when her husband have follow 
strange woman she have turn he into a Bezer 
and make he bite out his own stone 

it be strange 

I will tell you another as strange as that of one 
when a vintner have send she but ill wine 
she have convert he into a frog 
and then conjure he into one of his butt 
where he have live twelve month upon the lees 
and when his old guest chance to come to see he 
he have croak to they out at the bunghole 

this be miraculous 

there be a lawyer 
that speak against one of they at the bar 

what do she then 

turn he into a ram 
and still that ram retain his profession 
have many client and plead cause as well 
as some lawyer in Westminster 

do you think 
that he have have recourse to any such 

I know not but it be good to be mistrustful 
he may have advantage in the encounter 

there she come win she and wear she 

hold your hand 
I will have no blood a prologue to my wedding 

nay then have at you hold i not I say 
I be as fierce as he

do stand in competition for your love 

mr Trimalchio I confess have be 
a former suitor but with his ill carriage 
he have thus long prevent his good fortune 

then let i make a motion 

what be it 

will they both stand to it 

I agree 

and I 

then let the lady dispose of herself 

Shee be my already I be sure to she 
before a justice 

I will have no woman 
against her will 

no sir nor you shall not 
since you be so peremptory on your word then 
that he shall sing a palinodium 
and recant his ill course I assume 
my love Trimalehio 

do we take or be we take 

nay we do take 

who be that Capritio where have you be 
come your way forth and lay hand on the spoil 
go lead away that lady by the hand 
now you may take occasion by the foretop 
advance your own predominant the better 
and march away 

Come let we to the church 

and what must I do now be laugh at 

will you 
hazard yourself for one that care not for you 
you may be glad you scape recall yourself 
be not you former engage 

no never 

not to mistress Quartilla 

faith we have toy 
in jest sometime 

let it be now in earnest 
make her amends I know she love you 

well 
I will have she and stand up for my portion 
with the rest of my tribe 

stay here a little they be go to church 
and will return in couple first Trimalchio 
that giant in conceit think he be match 
to some great heir but shall embrace a cloud 
in stead of Juno then her wait woman 
her Iris reflect upon Capritio 
and for my piece of fragmentary courtship 
my miscellany gentleman it be his lot 
to be cast upon Quartilla with agurte 
in his old justiceship all these march together 
like the seven deadly sin and behind they 
come Autolicus the clerk of the company 

look you sir here they come 

make room methinks 
you shall not stop the course of justice so 
my lord Philantus you be welcome from 
the war and I from the church I wonder 
who make the better return you have get 
honour and so have I but where be your wealth 
I can embrace five thousand pound a year 
that be nothing with you I have no more wit 
than to be pie by pimp and marry whore 
yet I mean short to rank with your honour 
here be my warrant I have promise she 
to make she a countess but that be nothing with you 
nay more than this I can go on and leave 
some advancement behind i ecce signum 

it be well I be glad of your happiness 
and much joy to my brother Capritio 
and his fair spouse 

she be accord to 
my heart desire sir 

well a word with you 
master Trimalchio and the rest

you be as good know it at first as at last 
you be not the first that have be deceive 

in what my wife I marry she for a maid 
and whether she be one or no I care not 

nay shall I hear a man that shall abuse she 
in that I will defend she with my sword 
but she and you must call this man your father 

I so she must he give she at the church 

nay her own natural father flesh and bone 
I hope she will not deny it 

no indeed sir 
I will not live to be so ungracious 

I must acknowledge thou my child or I 
shall do thy mother wrong 

I do not think so 
you will not make i believe that I take she 
for a lord daughter and a great heir where be 
agurte and the captain to justify it 
be he your father 

he have ever breed i 
and I have always call he so I hope 
it be no shame my parentage be honest 

well if he be it be no disparagement 
to marry a justices daughter 

Come you have 
be carry hood wink through this business 
nor be the day yet clear before you mark i 
I will open but one leaf in all the book 
and you shall see the whole discovery 
Come sir unease 

who have we here Agurtes 
and the captain be it you that play the justice 
and you his clerk 

and I the constable 

then you be a knot of knave for your labour 
now I perceive that I be plain gull 

I be glad there be no man cheat but himself 

your arrow be one of the same quiver too 

I will none of she by this light 

why you may choose 
and yet I do not well see how you can choose 
she be your wife and you have marry she 
and must allow her mean to maintain she 
you may declare yourself unto the world 
and be laugh at but keep your own counsel 
and who needs know of it 

believe i sir 
the gentlewoman be not to be despise 
her wit and virtue be dowry sufficient 

nay if you say so then must I needs love she 
but by this hand I think you will have jeer i 

hold on your course march on as you come in 
and rest content since fate have think it fit 
to make your fortune equal with your wit
