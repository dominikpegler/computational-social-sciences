Midas where the god bestow benefit they ask thanks but where they receive good turn they give reward thou have fill my belly with meat my ear with music my eye with wonder Bacchus of all the god be the best fellow and Midas among man a king of fellow all thy ground be vineyard thy corn grape thy chamber seller thy household stuff stand cup and therefore ask any thing it shall be grant will thou have the pipe of thy conduct to run wine the udder of thy beast to drop nectar or thy tree to bud ambrosia desire thou to be fortunate in thy love or in thy victory famous or to have the year of thy life as many as the hair on thy head Nothing shall be deny so great be Bacchus so happy be Midas 

Bacchus for a king to beg of a god it be no shame but to ask with advice wisdom give i leave to consult lest desire thing above my reach I be fire with Phaeton or against nature and be drown with Icarus and so perish the world shall both laugh and wonder cry magnis tamen excidit ausis 

consult Bacchus will consent 

now my lord let i hear your opinion what wish may make Midas most happy and his subject best content 

be I a king I will wish to possess my mistress for what sweetness can there be find in life but love who wound the more mortal they be to the heart the more immortal they make the possessor and who know not that the possess of that must be most precious the pursue whereof be so please 

love be a pastime for child breed nothing but folly and nourish nothing but idleness I will wish to be monarch of the world conquer kingdom like village and be great on the earth be commander of the whole earth for what be there that more tickle the mind of a king than a hope to be the only king wring out of every country tribute and in his own to sit in triumph those that call conqueror ambitious be like those that teach thrift covetousness cleanliness pride honesty preciseness command the world Midas a great thing you can desire a less you shall not 

what say you Mellacrites 

Nothing but that these two have say nothing I will wish that everything I touch may turn to gold this be the sinew of war and the sweetness of peace be it not gold that make the chaste to yield to lust the honest to lewdness the wise to folly the faithful to deceit and the most holy in heart to be most hollow of heart in this word gold be all the power of the god the desire of man the wonder of the world the miracle of nature the looseness of fortune and triumph of time by gold may you shake the court of other prince and have your own settle one spade of gold undermine fast than a hundred mattock of steel will one be think religious and devout quantum cuique sva nummorum seruat in arca tantum habet & fidei religion balance be golden bag desire you virtue querenda pecunia primum est virtus post nummos the first stair of virtue be money do any thirst after gentry and wish to be esteem beautiful & genus & formam regina pecunia donat king coin have a mint to stamp gentleman and art to make amiableness I deny not but love be sweet and the marrow of a man mind that to conquer king be the quintessence of the thought of king why then follow both aurea sunt vera nunc saecula plurimus auro venit honos auro conciliatur amor it be a world for gold honour and love be both take up on interest do Midas determine to tempt the mind of true subject to draw they from obedience to treachery from their allegiance and oath to treason and perjury quid non mortalia pectora cogit aurisacra fame what hole do not gold bear in man heart such virtue be there in gold that be breed in the barren ground and tread under foot it mount to sit on prince head wish gold Midas or wish not to be Midas in the council of the god be not Anubis with his long nose of gold prefer before Neptune who stature be but brass and Aesculapius more honour for his golden beard than Apollo for his sweet harmony 

to have gold and not love which can be purchase by gold be to be a slave to gold 

to possess mountain of gold and a mistress more precious than gold and not to command the world be to make Midas new prentice to a mint and journeyman to a woman 

to enjoy a fair lady in love and want fair gold to give to have thousand of people to fight and no penny to pay will make one mistress wild and his soldier tame jupiter be a god but he know gold be a great and fly into those grate with his golden wing where he can not enter with his swan wing what stay Atlanta course with Hippomenes a apple of gold what make the three goddess strive a apple of gold if therefore thou make not thy mistress a goldfinch thou may chance to find she a wagtail believe i res est ingeniosa dare beside how many gate of city this golden key have open we may remember of late and ought to fear hereafter that iron world be wear out the golden be now come sub jove nunc mundus iussa sequare jovis 

gold be but the gut of the earth 

I have rather have the earth gut than the moon brain what be it that gold can command or have not conquer justice herself that sit wimple about the eye do it not because she will take no gold but that she will not be see blush when she take it the balance she hold be not to weigh the right of the cause but the weight of the bribe she will put up her naked sword if thou offer she a golden scabbard 

cease you to dispute I be determine it be gold Bacchus that Midas desire let every thing that Midas touch be turn to gold so shall thou bless thy guest and manifest thy godhead let it be gold Bacchus 

Midas thy wish cleave to thy last word take up this stone 

fortunate Midas it be gold Mellacrites gold it be gold 

this stick 

gold Mellacrites my sweet boy all be gold for ever honour be Bacchus that above measure have make Midas fortunate 

if Midas be please Bacchus be I will to my temple with Silenus for by this time there be many to offer unto i sacrifice paenam pro munere poscis 

Come my lord I will with gold pave my court and deck with gold my turret these petty island near to Phrygia shall totter and other kingdom be turn topsy turuie I will command both the affection of man and the fortune chastity will grow cheap where gold be not think dear Celia chaste Celia shall yield you my lord shall have my hand in your house turn your brazen gate to fine gold thus shall Midas be monarch of the world the darer of fortune the commander of love Come let we in 

we follow desire that our thought may be touch with thy finger that they also may become gold 

well I fear the event because of Bacchus last word paenam pro munere poscis 

tush he be a drunken god else he will not have give so great a gift now it be do I care not for any thing he can do 

thou serve Mellacrites and I his daughter which be the better man 

the masculine gender be more worthy than the feminine therefore Licio backare 

that be when those two gender be at jar but when they belong both to one thing then 

what then 

then they agree like the fiddle and the stick 

pulchrè sanè God blessing on thy blue nose but Licio my mistress be a proper woman 

ay but thou know neither property 

I care not for her quality so I may embrace her quantity 

be you so pert 

I and so expert that I can aswell tell the thought of a woman heart by her eye as the change of the weather by a almanac 

sir boy you must not be saucy 

no but faithful and serviceable 

lock up your lip or I will lop they off but sirrah for thy better instruction I will unfold every wrinkle of my mistress disposition 

I pray thou do 

but for this time I will only handle the head and purtenance 

nothing else 

why will not that be a long hour work to describe that be almost a whole day work to dress 

proceed 

first she have a head as round as a tennis ball 

I will my bed be a hazard 

why 

Nothing but that I will have her head there among other ball 

video pro intelligo then have she a hawk eye 

o that I be a partridge head 

to what end 

that she may tire with her eye on my countenance 

will thou be hang 

scilicet 

well she have the tongue of a parrot 

that be a leaden dagger in a velvet sheath to have a black tongue in a fair mouth 

tush it be not for the blackness but for the babble for every hour she will cry walk knave walk 

then will I mutter a rope for parrot a rope 

so may thou be hang not by the lip but by the neck then sir have she a calf tooth 

o monstrous mouth I will then it have be a sheep eye and a neat tongue 

it be not for the bigness but the sweetness all her tooth be as sweet as the sweet tooth of a calf 

sweet mean 

she have the ear of a want 

do she want ear 

I say the ear of a want a mole thou do want wit to understand i she will hear though she be never so low on the ground 

why then if one ask she a question it be likely she will hearken to it 

harken thou after that she have the nose of a sow 

then belike there she wear her wedding ring 

no she can smell a knave a mile off 

let we go far Licio she have both we in the wind 

she have a beetle brow 

what be she beetle browed 

thou have a beetle head I say the brow of a beetle a little fly who brow be as black as velvet 

what lip have she 

tush the lip be no part of the head only make for a double leaf door for the mouth 

what be then the chin 

that be only the threshold to the door 

I perceive you be drive to the wall that stand behind the door for this be ridiculous but now you can say no more of the head begin with the purtenance for that be your promise 

the purtenance it be impossible to reckon they up much less to tell the nature of they hood frontlet wire cawl curlingiron periwig bodkin fillet hairlace ribbon roll knotstring glass comb cap hat coif kercher clothes earring border crippin shadow spot and so many other trifle as both I want the word of art to name they time to utter they and wit to remember they these be but a few note 

note quoth you I note one thing 

what be that 

that if every part require so much as the head it will make the rich husband in the world ache at the heart 

but soft here come Pipenetta what news 

I will not be in your coat for any thing 

Indeed if thou shall rig up and down in our jacket thou will be think a very tomboy 

I mean I will not be in your case 

neither shall thou Pipenetta for first they be too little for thy body and then too fair to pull over so foul a skin 

these boy be drunk I will not be in your take 

I think so for we take nothing in our hand but weapon it be for thou to use needle and pin a sampler not a buckler 

nay then we shall never have do I mean I will not be so course as you shall be 

worse and worse we be no chase pretty mop for deer we be not neither red nor fallow because we be bachelor and have not cornu copia we want head hare we can be because they be male one year and the next female we change not our sex badger we be not for our leg be one as long as another and who will take we to be fox that stand so never a goose and bite not 

fool you be and therefore good game for wise man to hunt but for knave I leave you for honest wench to talk of 

nay stay sweet Pipenetta we be but dispose to be merry 

I marvel how old you will be before you be dispose to be honest but this be the matter my master be go abroad and want his page to wait on he my mistress will rise and lack your worship to fetch her hair 

why be it not on her head 

methinks it shall but I mean the hair that she must wear today 

why do she wear any but her own 

in faith sir no I be sure it be her own when she pay for it but do you hear the strange news at the court 

no except this be it to have one hair lie all night out of the house from one head 

tush every thing that Midas touch be gold 

the devil it be 

Indeed gold be the devil 

thou be deceive wench angel be gold but be it true 

true why the meat that he touch turn to gold so do the drink so do his raiment 

I will he will give i a good box on the ear that I may have a golden cheek 

how happy shall we be if he will but stroke our head that we may have golden hair but let we all in lest he lose the virtue of the gift before we taste the benefit 

if he take a cudgel and that turn to gold yet beat you with it you shall only feel the weight of gold 

what difference to be beat with gold and to be beat gold 

as much as to say drink before you go and go before you drink 

Come let we go lest we drink of a dry cup for our long tarry 

fair Caelia thou see of gold there be satiety of love there can 

if thou shall wish that whatsoever thou think may be love as Midas whatever he touch may be gold it may be love will be as loathsome to thy ear as gold be to his eye and make thy heart pinch with melancholy as his gut do with famine 

no sweet Caelia in love there be variety 

Indeed man vary in their love 

they vary their love yet change it not 

love and change be at variance therefore if they vary they must change 

Men change the manner of their love not the humour the mean how to obtain not the mistress they honour so do jupiter that can not entreat Danae by golden word possess his love by a golden shower not alter his affection but use art 

the same jupiter be a eagle a swan a bull and for every saint a new shape as man have for every mistress a new shadow if you take example of the god who more wanton more waver if of yourselves be but man who will think you more constant than god Eristus if gold can have allure my eye thou know Midas that command all thing to be gold have conquer if threat may have fear my heart Midas be a king may have command my affection if love gold or authority may have enchant i Midas have obtain by love gold and authority quorum si singula nostram flectere non poterant potuissent omnia mentem 

ah Caelia if king say they love and yet dissemble who dare say that they dissemble and not love they command the affection of other yield and their own to be believe my tear which have make furrow in my cheek and in my eye fountain my sigh which have make of my heart a furnace and kindle in my head flame my body that melt by piecemeal and my mind that pine at a instant may witness that my love be both unspotted and unspeakable quorum si singula duram flectere non poterant deberent omnia mentem but soft here come the princess with the rest of the lord 

Mellacrites I can tell whether I shall more mislike thy council or Midas consent but the covetous humour of you both I contemn and wonder at be unfit for a king who honour shall consist in liberality not greediness and unworthy the call of Mellacrites who fame shall rise by the soldier god mar not by the merchant god gold 

madam thing past can be recall but repent and therefore be rather to be pity than punish it now behoove we how to redress the miserable estate of our king not to dispute of the occasion your highness see and without grief you can see that his meat turn to massy gold in his mouth and his wine slide down his throat like liquid gold if he touch his robe they be turn to gold and what be not that touch he but become gold 

i Mellacrites if thy tongue have be turn to gold before thou give our king such council Midas heart have be full of ease and thy mouth of gold 

if my advice have take place Midas that now sit over head and ear in crown have wear upon his head many king crown and be conqueror of the world that now be commander of dross that greediness of Mellacrites who heartstring be make of Plutus pursestring have make Midas a lump of earth that shall be a god on earth and thy effeminate mind Eristus who eye be stitch on Celia face and thought guide to her beauty have breed in all the court such a tender wantonness that nothing be think of but love a passion proceed of beastly lust and colour with a courtly name of love thus while we follow the nature of thing we forget the name since this unsatiable thirst of gold and untemperate humour of lust creep into the king court soldier have beg alm of artificer and with their helmet on their head be glad to follow a lover with a glove in his hat which so much abate the courage of true captain that they must account it more honourable in the court to be a coward so rich and amorous than in a camp to be valiant if poor and maim he be more favour that prick his finger with his mistress needle than he that break his lance on his enemy face and he that have his mouth full of fair word than he that have his body full of deep scar if one be old and have silver hair on his beard so he have golden ruddock in his bag he must be wise and honourable if young and have curl lock on his head amorous glance with his eye smooth speech in his mouth every lady lap shall be his pillow every lady face his glass every lady ear a sheath for his flattery only soldier if they be old must beg in their own country if young try the fortune of war in another he be the man that be let blood carry his arm in a scarf of his mistress favour not he that bear his leg on a stilt for his country safety 

stay Martius though I know love to grow to such looseness and hoard to such misery that I may rather grieve at both than remedy either yet thy animate my father to continual arm to conquer crown have only bring he into imminent danger of his own head the love he have follow I fear unnatural the riches he have get I know unmeasurable the war he have levy I doubt unlawful have draw his body with grey hair to the graves mouth and his mind with eat care to desperate determination ambition have but two step the low blood the high envy both these have my unhappy father climb dig mine of gold with the life of man and now envy of the whole world be environ with enemy round about the world not know that ambition have one heel nail in hell though she stretch her finger to touch the heaven I will the god will remove this punishment so that Midas will be penitent let he thrust thou Eristus with thy love into Italy where they honour lust for a God as the egyptian do dog thou Mellacrites with thy greediness of gold to the utmost part of the west where all the gut of the earth be gold and thou Martius that sound but blood and terror into those barbarous nation where nothing be to be find but blood and terror let Phrygia be a example of chastity not lust liberality not covetousness valour not tyranny I wish not your body banish but your mind that my father and your king may be our honour and the world wonder and thou Caelia and all you lady learn this of Sophronia that beauty in a minute be both a blossom and a blast love a worm which seem to live in the eye die in the heart you be all young and fair endeavour all to be wise and virtuous that when like rose you shall fall from the stalk you may be gather and put to the still 

madam I be free from love and unfortunate to be belove 

to be free from love be strange but to think scorn to be belove monstrous 

Eristus thy tongue do itch to talk of love and my ear tingle to hear it I charge you all if you owe any duty to your king to go present unto the temple of Bacchus offer praisegift and sacrifice that Midas may be release of his wish or his life this I entreat you this Midas command you jar not with yourselves agree in one for your king if ever you take Midas for your lawful king 

madam we will go and omit nothing that duty may perform or pain 

go speedy lest Midas die before you return and you Caelia shall go with i that with talk we may beguile the time and my father think of no meat 

I attend 

ah my girl be not this a golden world 

it be all one as if it be lead with i and yet as golden with i as with the king for I see it and feel it not he feel it and enjoy it not 

gold be but the earth garbage a weed breed by the sun the very rubbish of barren ground 

tush Licio thou be unlettered all the earth be a egg the white silver the yolk gold 

why thou fool what hen shall lay that egg 

I warrant a goose 

nay I believe a bull 

Blirt to you both it be lay by the sun 

the sun be rather a cock than a hen 

it be true girl else how can Titan have tread Daphne 

I weep over both your wit if I prove in every respect no difference between a egg and gold will you not then grant gold to be a egg 

yes but I believe thy idle imagination will make it a addle egg 

let we hear proceed doctor egg 

gold will be crack a common say a crack crown 

i that be a break head 

nay then I see thou have a break wit 

well suppose gold will crack 

so will a egg 

on 

a egg be roast in the fire 

well 

So be gold try in the fire 

forth 

a egg as physician say will make one lusty 

conclude 

and who know not that gold will make one frolic 

Pipenetta this be true for it be call egg as a thing that do egg on so do gold 

let we hear all 

egg potch be for a weak stomach and gold boil for a consume body 

speak like a physician 

or a fool of necessity 

a egg be eat at one sup and a portague lose at one cast 

gamesterlike conclude 

egg make custard and gold make spoon to eat they 

a reason doughbaked 

o the oven of his wit be not thorough heat 

only this odds I find between money and egg which make i wonder that be more penny in the world than egg that one shall have three egg for a penny and not three penny for a egg 

a wonderful matter but your wisdom be overshoot in your comparison for egg have chicken gold have none 

mops I pity thou gold have egg change a angel into ten shilling and all those piece be the angel egg 

he have make a speak will thou eat a egg but soft here come our master let we shrink aside 

a short answer yet a sound Bacchus be pithy and pitiful 

in Pactolus go bathe thy wish and thou 
thy wish the wave shall have and thou be free 

I understand no oracle shall the water turn every thing to gold what then shall become of the fish shall he be free from gold what then shall become of we of his crown of our country I like not these riddle 

thou Martius be so warlike that thou will cut of the wish with a sword not cure it with a salve but the god that can give the desire of the heart can as easy withdraw the torment suppose Vulcan shall so temper thy sword that be thy heart never so valeant thy arm never so strong yet thy blade shall never draw blood will not thou wish to have a weak hand and a sharp edge 

yes 

if Mars shall answer thou thus go bathe thy sword in water and wash thy hand in milk and thy sword shall cleave adamant and thy heart answer the sharpness of thy sword will not thou try the conclusion 

what else 

then let Midas believe till he have try and think that the god rule as well by give remedy as grant wish but Eristus be mum 

Caelia have seal his mouth 

Caelia have seal her face in my heart which I be no more ashamed to confess than thou that Mars have make a scar in thy face Martius but let we in to the king sir boy you wait well 

we dare not go to Bacchus for if I see a grape my head ache 

and if I find a cudgel I will make your shoulder ache 

and you Licio wait on yourself 

I can choose sir I be always so near myself 

I will be as near you as your skin present 

in Pactolus go bathe thy wish and thou 
thy wish the wave shall have and thou be free 
miserable Midas as unadvised in thy wish as in thy success unfortunate o unquenchable thirst of gold which turn man head to lead and make they blockish their heart to iron and make they covetous their eye to delight in the view and make they blind in the use I that do possess mine of gold can not be content till my mind be also a my can not the treasure of Phrygia nor the tribute of Greece nor mountain in the east who gut be gold satisfy thy mind with gold ambition eat gold and drink blood climb so high by other man head that she break her own neck what shall I do with a world of ground who body must be content with seven foot of earth or why do I covet to get so many crown have myself but one head those that take small vessel at the sea I account pirate and myself that suppress whole fleet a conqueror as though robbery of Midas may mask under the name of triumph and the traffic of other nation be call treachery thou have pamper up thyself with slaughter as Diomedes do his horse with blood so unsatiable thy thirst so heavy thy sword two book have I always carry in my bosom call they the dagger and the sword in which the name of all prince nobleman and gentleman be dedicate to slaughter or if not which worse be to slavery o my lord when I call to mind my cruelty in Lycaonia my usurp in Getulia my oppression in Sola then do I find neither mercy in my conquest nor colour for my war nor measure in my tax I have write my law in blood and make my god of gold I have cause the mother womb to be their child tomb cradle to swim in blood like boat and the temple of the god a stew for strumpet have not I make the sea to groan under the number of my ship and have they not perish that there be not two leave to make a number have I not thrust my subject into a camp like ox into a cart who have make slave by unjust war I use now as slave for all war have not I entice the subject of my neighbour prince to destroy their natural king like moth that eat the cloth in which they be breed like viper that gnaw the bowel of which they be bear and like worm that consume the wood in which they be engender to what kingdom have not I pretend claim as though I have be by the god create heir apparent to the world make every trifle a title and all the territory about i traitor to i why do I wish that all may be gold I touch but that I think all man heart will be touch with gold that what policy can not compass nor prowess gold may have command and conquer a bridge of gold do I mean to make in that island where all my navy can not make a breach those island do I long to touch that I may turn they to gold and myself to glory but unhappy Midas who by the same mean perish himself that he think to conquer other be now become a shame to the world a scorn to that petty prince and to thyself a consumption a petty prince Midas no a prince protect by the god by nature by his own virtue and his subject obedience have not all treason be discover by miracle not counsel that do the god challenge be not the country wall with huge wave that do nature claim be he not through the whole world a wonder for wisdom and temperance that be his own strength do not all his subject like bee swarm to preserve the king of bee that their loyalty maintain my lord I faint both for lack of food and want of grace I will to the river where if I be rid of this intolerable disease of gold I will next shake off that untemperate desire of government and measure my territory not by the greatness of my mind but the right of my succession 

I be not a little sorry that because all that your highness touch turn to pure gold and therefore all your princely affection shall be convert to dross do your majesty begin to melt your own crown that shall make it with other monarchy massy begin you to make enclosure of of your mind and to debate of inheritance when the sword proclaim you conqueror if your highness heart be not of kingdom proof every pelt prince will batter it though you lose this garish gold let your mind be still of steel and let the sharp sword decide the right of sceptre 

every little king be a king and the title consist not in the compass of ground but in the right of inheritance 

be not conquest good title 

conquest be great theft 

if your highness will be advise by i then will I rob for kingdom and if I obtain fain will I see he that dare call the conqueror a thief 

Martius thy council have shed as much blood as will make another sea valour I can call it and barbarousness be a word too mild Come Mellacrites let we go and come you Eristus that if I obtain mercy of Bacchus we may offer sacrifice to Bacchus Martius if you be not dispose to go dispose as you will of yourself 

I will humble attend on your highness as still hope to have my heart desire and you your height of honour

my heart be hollow too and nothing can stop it but gold 

thou can not eat meat without tooth 

nor buy it without money 

thou may get more gold if thou lose these more tooth thou can not 

ay but the golden beard will last i ten year in porridge and then to what use be tooth 

if thou want tooth thy tongue will catch cold 

it be true and if I lack money my whole body may go naked but lycio let the barber have his beard I will have a device by thy help to get it again and a cozenage beyond that maugre his beard 

that be the best way both to ease thy pain and try our wit

guild nay boy all my beard be gold it be not guilt I will not be so overmatch 

you can pose my master in a beard Come to his house you shall sit upon twenty all his cushion be stuff with beard 

let he go home with thou ease he and thou shall have thy beard 

I be content but I will have the beard in my hand to be sure 

and I thy finger in my mouth to be sure of ease 

agree 

Dello sing a song to the tune of my tooth do ache 

I will 

lady here must we attend the happy return of my father but in the mean season what pastime shall we use to pass the time I will agree to any so it be not to talk of love 

then sleep be the best exercise 

why Suavia be you so light that you must chat of love or so heavy that you must needs sleep Penelope in the absence of her lord beguile the day with spin 

indeed she spin a fair thread if it be to make a string to the bow wherein she draw herwoers 

why Suavia it be a bow which she know to be above thy strength and therein she show her wit 

Qui latus arguerit corneus arcu erat it be make of horn madam and therein she show her meaning 

why do thou not think she be chaste 

yes of all her wooer 

to talk with thou be to lose time not well to spend it how say you Amerula what shall we do 

tell tale 

what say you Caelia 

Sing 

what think you Camilla 

dance 

you see Suavia that there be other thing to keep one from idleness beside love nay that there be nothing to make idleness but love 

well let i stand by and feed my own thought with sweetness while they fill your eye and ear with song and dance 

Amerula begin thy tale 

there dwell sometime in Phrygia a lady very fair but pass froward as much marvel at for beauty as for peevishness mislike high she be in the instep but short in the heel straight lace but loose body it come to pass that a gentleman as young in wit as year and in year a very boy chance to glance his eye on she and there be they dazzle on her beauty as lark that be catch in the sun with the glitter of a glass in her fair look be his thought entangle like the bird of canary that fall into a silken net dote he do without measure and die he must without her love she on the other side as one that know her good begin to look askance yet feel the passion of love eat into her heart though she dissemble they with her eye 

ha ha he 

why laugh thou 

to see you madam so tame as to be bring to hear a tale of love that before be so wild you will not come to the name and that Amerula can devise how to spend the time with a tale only that she may not talk of love and now to make love only her tale 

Indeed I be overshoot in judgement and she in discretion Amerula another tale or none this be too lovely 

nay let i hear any woman tell a tale of x line long without it tend to love and I will be bind never to come at the court and you Caelia that will fain trip on your pettitoe can you persuade i to take delight to dance and not love or you that can rule your foot can guide your affection have the one as unstaid as the other unsteady dance be love sauce therefore I dare be so saucy as if you love to dance to say you dance for love but Camilla she will sing who voice if it shall utter her thought will make the tune of a heart out of tune she that have crotchet in her head have also love conceit I dare swear she harp not only on plain song and before you Sophronia none of they all use plain deal but because they see you so curious they frame themselves counterfeit for myself as I know honest love to be a thing inseparable from our sex so do I think it most allowable in the court unless we will have all our thought make of churchwork and so carry a holy face and a hollow heart 

lady how like you Suavia in her love vain 

we be content at this time to soothe she in her vanity 

Shee cast all our mind in the mould of her own head and yet err as far from our meaning as she do from her own modesty 

Amerula if you be not bitter your name have be ill bestow but I think it as lawful in the court to be count love and chaste as you in the temple to seem religious and be spiteful 

I marvel you will reply any more Amerula her tongue be so nimble it will never lie still 

the like thy foot Camilla which be teach not to stand still 

So no more lady let our come to sport not turn to spite love thou Suavia if thou think it sweet sing thou Caelia for thy own content tell thou tale and dance thou Camilla and so every one use her own delight shall have no cause to be discontent but here come Martius and the rest what news Martius of my sovereign and father Midas 

madam he no soon bathe his limb in the river but it turn to a golden stream the sand to fine gold and all to gold that be cast into the water Midas dismay at the sudden alteration assay again to touch a stone but he can not alter the nature of the stone then go we with he to the temple of Bacchus where we offer a lance wreathe about with ivy garland of ripe grape and skin of wolf and panther and a great stand cup of the water which so late be turn to gold Bacchus accept our gift command Midas to honour the god and also in wish to be as wise as he mean to have make he fortunate 

happy Sophronia that have live to hear these news and happy Midas if thou live better to govern thy fortune but what be become of our king 

Midas overjoy with this good fortune determine to use some solace in the wood where by chance we rouse a great bear he eager of the sport outride we and we think he have be come to his palace some other way come ourselves the next way if he be not return he can be long we have also lose our page which we think be with he 

the god shield he from all harm the wood be full of tiger and he of courage wild beast make no difference between a king and a clown nor hunter in the heat of their pastime fear no more the fierceness of the boar than the fearfulness of the hare but I hope well let we in to see all well 

Pan will thou contend with Apollo who tune the heaven and make they all hang by harmony Orpheus that cause tree to move with the sweetness of his harp offer yearly homage to my lute so do Arion that bring dolphin to his sugar note and Amphion that by music rear the wall of Thebes only pan with his harsh whistle which make beast shake for fear not man dance for joy seek to compare with Apollo 

Pan be a god Apollo be no more comparison can be odious where the deity be equal this pipe my sweet pipe be once a nymph a fair nymph once my lovely mistress now my heavenly music tell i Apollo be there any instrument so sweet to play on as one mistress have thy lute be of laurel and the string of Daphne hair thy tune may have be compare to my note for then Daphne will have add to thy stroke sweetness and to thy thought melody 

do pan talk of the passion of love of the passion of divine love o how that word Daphne wound Apollo pronounce by the barbarous mouth of pan I fear his breath will blast the fair green if I dazzle not his eye that he may not behold it thy pipe a nymph some hag rather haunt these shady grove and desire not thy love but the fellowship of such a monster what God be pan but the god of beast of wood and hill exclude from heaven and in earth not honour break thy pipe or with my sweet lute will I break thy heart let not love enter into those savage lip a word for jove for Apollo for the heavenly god who thought be god and god be all love 

Apollo I tell thou before that pan be a God I tell thou now again as great a god as Apollo I have almost say a great and because thou shall know I care not to tell my thought I say a great Pan feel the passion of love deep engrave in his heart with as fair nymph with as great fortune as Apollo as Neptune as jove and better than pan can none describe love not Apollo not Neptune not jove my temple be in arcady where they burn continual flame to pan in arcady be my oracle where Erato the nymph give answer for pan in arcady the place of love be the honour of pan I but I be God of hill so I be Apollo and that of hill so high as I can pry into the juggle of the high god of wood so I be Apollo of wood so thick that thou with thy beam can not pierce they I know Apollo pry I know my own jealousy sun and shadow cousin one another be thou sun still the shadow be fast at thy heel Apollo i as near to thy love as thou to i a carter with his whistle and his whip in true ear move as much as Phoebus with his fiery chariot and wing horse loveleaf be as well for country porridge as heavenly nectar love make jupiter a goose and Neptune a swine and both for love of a earthly mistress what have make pan or any God on earth for god on earth can change their shape turn themselves for a heavenly goddess believe i Apollo our grove be pleasant than your heaven our milkmaid than your goddess our rude ditty to a pipe than your sonnet to a lute here be flat faith amo amas where you cry o utinam amarent vel non amassem I let pass Apollo thy hard word as call pan monster which be as much as to call all monster for pan be all Apollo but one but touch thy string and let these nymph decide 

those nymph shall decide unless thy rude speech have make they deaf as for any other answer to pan take this that it become not Apollo to answer pan Pan be all and all be pan thou be pan and all all pan and tinkerly but to this music wherein all thy shame shall be see and all my skill 

in the chase I lose all my company and miss the game too I think Midas shall in all thing be unfortunate 

what be he that talk 

Midas the unfortunate king of Phrygia 

to be a king be next be to a God thy fortune be not bad what be thy folly 

to abuse a God 

a ungrateful part of a king but Midas see by chance thou be come or send by some god of purpose none can in the earth better judge of god than king sit down with these nymph I be Apollo this pan both god we contend for sovereignty in music see it happen in earth we must be judge of those on earth in which there be none more worthy than king and nymph therefore give ear that thy judgement err not 

if god you be although I dare wish nothing of God be so deep wound with wish yet let my judgement prevail before these nymph if we agree not because I be a king 

there must be no condition but judge Midas and judge nymph 

then thus I begin both my song and my play 

oh divine Apollo o sweet consent 

if the god of music shall not be above our reach who shall 

I like it not 

now let i tune my pipe I can pipe and sing that be the odds in the instrument not the art but I will pipe and then sing and then judge both of the art and instrument 

have thou do Pan 

ay and do well as I think 

now nymph what say you 

we all say that Apollo have show himself both a god and of music the god pan himself a rude satire neither keep measure nor time his pipe as far out of tune as his body out of form to thou divine Apollo we give the prize and reverence 

but what say Midas 

methinks there be more sweetness in the pipe of pan than Apollo lute I brook not that nice tickle of string that content i that make one start what a shrillness come into my ear out of that pipe and what a goodly noise it make Apollo I must needs judge that pan deserve most praise 

bless be Midas worthy to be a God these girl who ear do but itch with daintiness gene the verdict without weigh the virtue they have be bring up in chamber with soft music not where I make the wood ring with my pipe Midas 

wretched unworthy to be a king thou shall know what it be to displease Apollo I will leave thou but the two last letter of they name to be thy whole name which if thou can not guess touch thy care they shall tell thou 

what have thou do Apollo the ear of a ass upon the head of a king 

and well worthy when the dulness of a ass be in the ear of a king 

help pan or Midas perish 

I can undo what Apollo have do nor give thou any amends unless to those ear thou will have add these horn 

it be very well that it may be hard to judge whether he be more ox or ass 

farewell Midas 

Midas farewell 

I warrant they be dainty ear nothing can please they but Pan pipe 

he have the advantage of all ear except the mouse for else there be none so sharp of hear as the ass farewell Midas 

Midas farewell 

farewell Midas 

ah Midas why be not thy whole body metamorphose that there may have be no part leave of Midas where shall I shroud this shame or how may I be restore to my old shape Apollo be angry blame not Apollo who be god of music thou do both dislike and dishonour prefer the barbarous noise of Pan pipe before the sweet melody of Apollo lute if I return to Phrygia I shall be point at if live in these wood savage beast must be my companion and what other companion shall Midas hope for than beast be of all beast himself the dull have it not be better for thou to have perish by a golden death than now to lead a beastly life unfortunate in thy wish unwise in thy judgement first a golden fool now a leaden ass what will they say in Lesbos if happy these news come to Lesbos if they come Midas yes report fly as swift as thought gather wing in the air and double rumour by her own run insomuch as have here the ear of a ass it will there be tell all my hair be ass ear then will this be the byword be Midas that seek to be monarch of the world become the mock of the world be his golden mine turn into water as free for every one that will fetch as for himself that possess they by wish ah poor Midas be his conceit become blockish his counsel unfortunate his judgement unskilful ah foolish Midas a just reward for thy pride to wax poor for thy overween to wax dull for thy ambition to wax humble for thy cruelty to say sisque miser semper nec sis miserabilis ulli but I must seek to cover my shame by art least be once discover to these petty king of Mysia Pisidia and Galatia they all join to add to my ass ear of all the beast the dull a sheep heart of all the beast the fearful and so cast lot for those kingdom that I have win with so many life and keep with so many envy 

I muse what the nymph mean that so sing in the grove Midas of Phrygia have ass ear 

I marvel not for one of they plain tell i he have ass ear 

ay but it be not safe to say it he be a great king and his hand be long than his ear therefore forus that keep sheep it be wisdom enough to tell sheep 

it be true yet since Midas grow so mischievous as to blur his diadem with blood which shall glister with nothing but pity and so miserable that he make gold his god that be frame to be his slave many broad speech have fly abroad in his own country they stick not to call he tyrant and else where usurper they flat say that he eat into other dominion as the sea do into the land not know that in swallow a poor island as big as Lesbos he may cast up three territory thrice as big as Phrygia for what the sea win in the marsh it lose in the sand 

take i with you but speak soft for these reed may have ear and hear we 

suppose they have yet they may be without tongue to bewray we 

nay let they have tongue too we have eye to see that they have none and therefore if they hear and speak they know not from whence it come 

well than this I say when a lion do so much degenerate from princely kind that he will borrow of the beast I say he be no lion but a monster piece with the craftiness of the fox the cruelty of the tiger the raven of the wolf the dissemble of hyena he be worthy also to have the ear of a ass 

he seek to conquer Lesbos and like a foolish gamester have a bagful of his own venture it all to win a groat of another 

he that fish for Lesbos must have such a wooden net as all the tree in Phrygia will not serve to make the cod nor all the wood in Pisidia provide the cork 

nay he mean to angle for it with a hook of gold and a bait of gold and so to strike the fish with a please bait that will slide out of a open net 

tush tush those islander be too subtle to nibble at craft and too richet to swallow treasure if that be his hope he may as well dive to the bottom of the sea and bring up a anchor of a thousand weight as plod with his gold to corrupt a people so wise and beside a nation as I have hear so valiant that be ready to strike than ward 

more than all this Amintas though we dare not so much as mutter it their king be such a one as dazzle the clear eye with majesty daunt the valiant heart with courage and for virtue fill all the world with wonder if beauty go beyond sight confidence above valour and virtue exceed miracle what be it to be think but that Midas go to undermine that by the simplicity of man that be fasten to a rock by the providence of the god 

we poor commons who taste war be make to relish nothing but tax can do nothing but grieve to see thing unlawful practise to obtain thing impossible all his mine do but gild his comb to make it glister in the war and cut we that be force to follow he in his war 

well that must be bear not blame that can be change for my part if I may enjoy the fleece of my silly flock with quietness I will never care three flock for his ambition 

let this suffice we may talk too much and be overhear be all undo I be so jealous that methinks the very reed bow down as though they listen to our talk and soft I hear some come let we in and meet at a place more meet 

be not hunt a tedious occupation 

I and troublesome for if you call a dog a dog you be undo 

you be both fool and beside baseminded hunt be for king not peasant such as you be unworthy to be hound much less huntsman that know not when a hound be fleet fair flewed and well hang be ignorant of the deepness of a hound mouth and the sweetness 

why I hope sir a cur mouth be no deep than the sea nor sweet than a honey comb 

pretty coxcomb a hound will swallow thou as easy as a great pit a small pibble 

Indeed hunt be a pleasant sport but the dog make such bark that one can hear the hound cry 

I will make thou cry if I catch thou in the forest thou shall be leash 

what be that 

do thou not understand their language 

not I 

it be the best calamance in the world as easy decipher as the character in a nutmeg 

I pray thou speak some 

I will 

but speak in order or I will pay you 

to it Petulus 

there be a boy leash on the single because when he be emboss he take soil 

what be that 

why a boy be beat on the tail with a leathern thong because when he foam at the mouth with run he go into the water 

this be worse than fustian mum you be best hunt be a honourable pastime and for my part I have as lief hunt a dear in a park as court a lady in a chamber 

give i a pastry for a park and let i shake off a whole kennel of tooth for hound then shall thou see a notable champ after that will I carouse a bowl of wine and so in the stomach let the venison take soil 

he have lay the plot to be prudent why it be pastry crust eat enough and it will make you wise a old proverb 

ay and eloquent for you must tipple wine free & foecundi calices quem non fecere disertum 

fecere dizardum leave off these toy and let we seek out Midas who we lose in the chase 

I will warrant he have by this start a covey of Buck or rouse a scull of pheasant 

treason to two brave sport hawk and hunt thou shall say start a hare rouse the dear spring the partridge 

I will warrant that be devise by some country swad that see a hare skip up which make he start he present say he start the hare 

ay and some lubber lie beside a spring and see a partridge come by say he do spring the partridge 

well remember all this 

Remember all nay then have we good memory for there be more phrase than thou have hair but let i see I pray thou what be this about thy neck 

a bugle 

if it have stand on thy head I shall have call it a horn well it be hard to have one brow embroider with bugle 

but can thou blow it 

what else 

but not away 

no it will make Boreas out of breath to blow his horn away 

there be good blow I will warrant before they come there 

well it be a shroud blow 

spare your wind in this or I will wind your neck in a cord but soft I hear my master blast 

some have feel it 

thy mother when such a fly blow be buzz out but I must be go I perceive Midas be come Ex 

then let not we tarry for now shall we shave the barber house the world will grow full of wile see Midas have lose his golden wish 

I care not my head shall dig devise and my tongue stamp they so as my mouth shall be a mint and my brain a my 

then help we to cozen the barber 

the barber shall know every hair of my chin to be as good as a chokepear for his purse 

I marvel what Midas mean to be so melancholy since his hunt 

it be a good word in Midas otherwise I shall term it in another blockishness I can tell whether it be a sourness common incident to age or a severeness particular to the king of Phrygia or a suspicion cleave to great estate but methinks he seem so jealous of we all and become so overthwart to all other that either I must conjecture his wit be not his own or his meaning very hard to some 

for my part I neither care nor wonder I see all his expedition for war be lay in water for now when he shall execute he begin to consult and suffer the enemy to bid we good morrow at our own door to who we long since may have give the last good night in their own bed he wear I know not whether for warmth or wantonness a great tiara on his head as though his head be not heavy enough unless he load it with great roll a attire never use that I can hear of but of old woman or pelt priest this will make Pisidia wanton Lycaonia stiff all his territory waver and he that have couch so many kingdom in one crown will have his kingdom scatter into as many crown as he possess country I will rouse he up and if his ear be not ass ear I will make they tingle I respect not my life I know it be my duty and certain I dare swear war be my profession 

Martius we will all join and though I have be as in Phrygia they term a brave courtier that be as they expound it a fine lover yet will I set both aside love and court and follow Martius for never shall it be say bella gerant alij semper Eristus amet 

and I Martius that honour gold for a god and account all other god but lead will follow Martius and say Vilius argentum est aurum virtutibus aurum 

my lord I give you thanks and be glad for there be no stout soldier in the world than those that be make of lover nor any more liberal in war than they that in peace have be covetous then doubt not if courage and coin can prevail but we shall prevail and beside nothing can prevail but fortune but here come Sophronia I will first talk with she enter Sophronia Camilla Amerula madam either our king have no ear to hear or no care to consider both in what state we stand be his subject and what danger he be in be our king duty be not regard courage contemn altogether careless of we and his own safety 

Martius I mislike not thy plain deal but pity my father trance a trance I must call that where nature can move nor counsel nor music nor physic nor danger nor death nor all but that which make i most both to sorrow and wonder be that music a mithridate for melancholy shall make he mad cry still vno namque modo pan and Apollo nocent none have access to he but motto as though melancholy be to be shave with a razor not cure with a medicine but stay what noise be this in those reed 

what sound be this who dare utter that he hear 

I dare Mellacrites the word be plain Midas the king have ass ear 

this be strange and yet to be tell the king 

so dare I Camilla for it concern i in duty and we all in discretion but soft let we hearken better 

Midas of Phrygia have ass ear 

this be monstrous and either portend some mischief to the king or unto the state confusion Midas of Phrygia have ass ear it be unpossible let we with speed to the king to know his resolution for to some oracle he must send till his majesty be acquaint with this matter we dare not root out the reed himself must both hear the sound and guess at the reason 

unfortunate Midas that be so great a king there shall out of the earth spring so great a shame 

it may be that his wish for gold be but dross of the world be by all the god account foolish and so discover out of the earth for a king to thirst for gold in steed of honour to prefer heap of worldly coin before triumph in warlike conquest be in my mind no princely mind 

let we not debate the cause but seek to prevent the snare for in my mind it foretell that which wound my mind let we in 

Sophronia thou see I be become a shame to the world and a wonder my ear glow my ear ah miserable Midas to have such ear as make thy check blush thy head monstrous and thy heart desperate yet in blush I be impudent for I walk in the street in deformity I seem comely for I have leave off my tiara and my heart the more heavy it be for grief the more hope it conceive of recovery 

dread sovereign and love sire there be nine day past and therefore the wonder be past there be many year to come and therefore a remedy to be hope for though your care belong yet be there room leave on your head for a diadem though they resemble the ear of the dull beast yet shall they not daunt the spirit of so great a king the god dally with man king be no more they disgrace king lest they shall be think god sacrifice please they so that if you know by the oracle what God wrought it you shall by humble submission by that God be release 

Sophronia I commend thy care and courage but let i hear these reed that these loathsome ear may be glut with the report and that be as good as a remedy 

Midas of Phrygia have ass ear 

Midas of Phrygia have ass ear so he have unhappy Midas if these reed sing my shame so loud will man whisper it soft no all the world already ring of it and as impossible it be to stay the rumor as to catch the wind in a net that blow in the air or to stop the wind of all man mouth that breathe out air I will to Apollo who oracle must be my doom and I fear i my dishonour because my doom be he if king may disgrace god and god they disgrace when they forget their duty 

what say Midas 

Nothing but that Apollo must determine all or Midas see ruin of all to Apollo will I offer a ivory lute for his sweet harmony and berry of bay as black as jet for his love Daphne pure simples for his physic and continual incense for his prophesy 

Apollo may discover some odd riddle but not give the redress for yet do I never hear that his oracle be without doubtfulness nor his remedy without impossibility this superstition of you be able to bring error among the common sort not ease to your discontent mind 

do thou not know Martius that when Bacchus command i to bathe myself in Pactolus thou think it a mere mockery before with thy eye thou see the remedy 

ay Bacchus give the wish and therefore be like also to give the remedy 

and who know whether Apollo give i these ear and therefore may release the punishment well reply not for I will to Delphos in the mean time let it be proclaim that if there be any so cunning that can tell the reason of these reed creak he shall have my daughter to his wife or if she refuse it a dukedom for his pain and withal that whosoever be so bold as to say that Midas have ass ear shall present lose he 

dear father then go forward prepare for the sacrifice and dispose of Sophronia as it best please you 

Come let we in

then follow 

this be Delphos sacred Apollo who oracle be all divine though doubtful answer poor Midas and pity he 

I marvel there be no answer 

fond Midas how can thou ask pity of he who thou have so much abuse or why do thou abuse the world both to seem ignorant in not acknowledge a offence and impudent so open to crave pardon Apollo will not answer but Midas must not cease Apollo divine Apollo Midas have ass ear yet let pity sink into thy ear and tell when he shall be free from this shame or what may mitigate his sin 

tush Apollo be tune his pipe or at barleybreak with Daphne or assay on some shepherd coat or take measure of a serpent skin be I Midas I will rather cut these ear off close from my head than stand whimper before such a blind God 

thou be barbarous not valiant god must be entreat not command thou will quench fire with a sword and add to my shame which be more than any prince can endure thy rudeness which be more than any sensible creature will follow divine Apollo what shall become of Midas accept this lute these berry these simples these taper if Apollo take any delight in music in Daphne in physic in eternity 
when pan Apollo in music shall excel Apollo his oracle 
Midas of Phrygia shall lose his ass ear 
pan do Apollo in music far excel 
therefore king Midas wear ass ear 
unless he shrink his stretch hand from Lesbos 
his ear in length at length shall reach to Delphos 

it be good to expound these oracle that the learned man in Phrygia be assemble otherwise the remedy will be as impossible to be have as the cause to be sift 

I foresee some old see which shall be doubtful who will gad to such god that must be honour if they speak without sense and the oracle wonder at as though it be above sense 

no more Martius I be the learned in Phrygia to interpret these oracle and though shame have hitherto cause i to conceal it now I must unfold it by necessity thus destiny bring i not only to be cause of all my shame but reporter thou Sophronia and you my lord harken when I have bathe my self in Pactolus and see my wish to float in the wave I wish the wave to overflow my body so melancholy my fortune make i so mad my folly yet by hunt I think to ease my heart And come at last to the hill Tmolus I perceive Apollo and Pan contend for excellency in music among nymph they require also my judgement I who the loss of gold make discontent and the possess desperate either dull with the humour of my weak brain or deceive by thickness of my deaf ear prefer the harsh noise of Pan pipe before the sweet stroke of Apollo lute which cause Phoebus in justice as I now confess and then as I see in anger to set these ear on my head that have wring so many tear from my eye for stretch my hand to Lesbos I find that all the god have spurn at my practise and those island scorn they my pride the god disdain my policy man my mine have be empty by soldier my soldier spoil by war my war without success because usurp my usurp without end because my ambition above measure I will therefore yield myself to Bacchus and acknowledge my wish to be vanity to Apollo and confess my judgement to be foolish to mar and say my war be unjust to Diana and tell my affection have be unnatural and I doubt not what a god have do to make i know myself all the god will help to undo that I may come to myself 

be it possible that Midas shall be so overshoot in judgement unhappy Midas who wit melt with his gold and who gold be consume with his wit 

what talk Sophronia to herself 

Nothing but that since Midas have confess his fault to we he also acknowledge it to Apollo 

I will Sophronia sacred Apollo thing pass can be recall repent they may be behold Midas not only submit himself to punishment but confess his peevishness be glad for shame to call that peevishness which indeed be folly whatsoever Apollo shall command Midas will execute 

then attend Midas I accept thy submission and sacrifice so as yearly at this temple thou offer sacrifice in submission withal take Apollo council which if thou scorn thou shall find thy destiny I will not speak in riddle all shall be plain because thou be dull but all certain if thou be obstinate 
weigh not in one balance gold and justice 
with one hand wage not war and peace 
let thy head be glad of one crown 
and take care to keep one friend 
the friend that thou will make thy foe 
the kingdom thou will make the world 
the hand that thou do arm with force 
the gold that thou do think a god 
shall conquer fall shrink short be common 
with force with pride with fear with traffic 
if this thou like shake off a ass ear 
if not for ever shake a ass ear 
Apollo will not reply 

it may be Sophronia that neither you nor any else understand Apollo because none of you have the heart of a king but my thought expound my fortune and my fortune hang upon my thought that great Apollo that join to my head ass ear have put into my heart a lion mind I see that by obscure shadow which you can discern in fresh colour Apollo in the depth of his dark answer be to i the glister of a bright sun I perceive and yet not too late that Lesbos will not be touch by gold by force it can that the god have pitch it out of the world as not to be control by any in the world though my hand be gold yet I must not think to span over the main ocean though my soldier be valiant I must not therefore think my quarrel just there be no way to nail the crown of Phrygia fast to my daughter head but in let the crown of other sit in quiet on they 

Midas 

how dare thou reply see i resolve thy counsel have spill more blood than all my soldier lance let none be so hardy as to look to cross i sacred Apollo if sacrifice yearly at thy temple and submission hourly in my own court if fulfil thy counsel and correct my councillor may shake off these ass ear I here before thou vow to shake off all envy abroad and at home all tyranny 

honour be Apollo Midas be restore 

fortunate Midas that feel thy head lighten of dull ear and thy heart of deadly sorrow Come my lord let we repair to our palace in which Apollo shall have a stately statue erect every month will we solemnize there a feast and here every year a sacrifice Phrygia shall be govern by god not man jest the god make beast of man so my counsel of war shall not make conquest in their own conceit nor my councillor in peace make i poor to enrich themselves So bless be Apollo quiet be Lesbos happy be Midas and to begin this solemnity let we sing to Apollo for so much as music nothing can content Apollo
