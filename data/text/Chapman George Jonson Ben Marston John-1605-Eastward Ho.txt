well Francke well the sea you say be uncertain but he that sail in your court sea shall find they ten time full of hazard wherein to see what be to be see be torment more than a free spirit can endure but when you come to suffer how many injury swallow you what care and devotion must you use to humour a imperious lord proportion your look to his look smile to his smile fit your sail to the wind of his breath 

tush he be no journeyman in his craft that can not do that 

but he be worse than a prentice that do it not only humour the lord but every trencherbearer every groom that by indulgence and intelligence creep into his favour and by Panarism into his chamber he rule the roast and when my honourable lord say it shall be thus my worshipful rascal the groom of his close stool say it shall not be thus clap the door after he and who dare enter a prentice quoth you it be but to learn to live and do that disgrace a man he that rise hardly stand firm but he that rise with ease alas fall as easy 

a pox on you who teach you this morality 

it be long of this witty age master Francis but indeed mistress synnedefie all trade complain of inconvenience and therefore it be best to have none the merchant he complain and say traffic be subject too much uncertainty and loss let they keep their good on dry land with a vengeance and not expose other man substance to the mercy of the wind under protection of a wooden wall as master Francis say and all for greedy desire to enrich themselves with unconscionable gain two for one or so where I and such other honest man as live by lend money be content with moderate profit thirty or forty in the hundred so we may have it with quietness and out of peril of wind and weather rather than run those dangerous course of trade as they do 

I dad thou may well be call security for thou take the safe course 

faith the quiet and the more content and out of doubt the more godly for merchant in their course be never please but ever repine against heaven one pray for a westerly wind to carry his ship forth another for a easterly to bring his ship home and at every shake of a lease he fall into a agony to think what danger his ship be in on such a coast and so forth the farmer he be ever at odds with the weather sometime the cloud have be too barren sometime the heaven forget themselves their harvest answer not their hope sometime the season fall out too fruitful corn will bear no price and so forth the artificer he be all for a stir world if his trade be too full and fall short of his expectation then fall he out of joint where we that trade nothing but money be free from all this we be please with all weather let it rain or hold up be calm or windy let the season be whatsoever let trade go how it will we take all in good part even what please the heaven to send we so the sun stand not still and the moon keep her usual return and make up day month and year 

and you have good security

I do wonder M wolf why you shall travail thus in a business so contrary to kind or the nature of your place that you be the keeper of a prison shall labour the release of your prisoner whereas methinks it be far more natural and kind in you to be range about for more and not let these escape you have already under the tooth but they say you wolf when you have suck the blood once that they be dry you have do 

sir your worship may descant as you please of my name but I protest I be never so mortify with any man discourse or behaviour in prison yet I have have of all sort of man in the kingdom under my key and almost of all religion in the land as papist protestant puritan brownist Anabaptist millenary family of love Jew Turk infidel atheist good fellow etc

I believe you M wolf good faith sir here be a great deal of humility in these letter 

humility sir ay be your worship a eyewitness of it you will say so the knight will in the knightsward do what we can sir and master quicksilver will be in the Hole if we will let he I never know or see prisoner more penitent or more devout they will sit you up all night sing of psalm and edify the whole prison only security sing a note too high sometime because he lie in the twopenny ward far off and can not take his tune the neighbour can not rest for he but come every morning to ask what godly prisoner we have 

which on they be it be so devout the knight or the tother 

both sir but the young man especial I never hear his like he have cut his hair too he be so well give and have such good gift he can tell you almost all the story of the book of martyr and speak you all the sickman salve without book
