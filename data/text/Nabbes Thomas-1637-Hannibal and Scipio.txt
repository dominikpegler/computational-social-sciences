here be the right use of victory to tame 
our fury with soft case and wantonness 
after so many travel have our Hannibal 
possess himself of Rome without a Capua 
the conquest have be poor 

these spoil of beauty 
and free one too that uncompelled will run 
to embrace a soldier rock he in her arm 
sing he asleep and with her icy finger 
comb the knot curl of his black hair 
so long neglect make herself the ravisher 
oh it be Elysium 

nay to have such change 
of pleasure court we as if their invention 
be busy to make our delight 
the object of their care here we be feast 
with chalcedonian tune rhodian guilt head 
and more than samian gluttony we drink 
no wine but of campania mascicus 
or grape crown Aulon boy more fair than he 
that bear jove cup rapt on the dusky wing 
of his skyborn eagle serve the banquet up 
in golden dish or corinthian plate 
luxury chief 

to crown the entertainment 
here sit a lady Hebe never blush 
a colour like she check and in her eye 
a thousand Cupid move in wanton frisk 
to catch the gazer there be another deck 
in the sea riches which the negro dive for 
her pearl reflection dimace the dark taper 
as if all light be borrow from those sun 
their orient roundness mock we with a three 
betray through a transparent lawn the beauty 
of a complexion white and red do never 
mix a more perfect and a shape exact 
as nature first Pandora the possession 
after desire have make a preparation 
in every sense to entertain these joy 
can earth afford a heaven and this not be 
the best hope ever feign 

then to be clothe 
in silk of tyrian dye to sleep on down 
and wake clasp a goddess in one arm 
lovely as Cytharea revel sometime 
and dance to the mermaid music till the night 
be make one artificial day invert 
the course of time and his action o delight 
beyond weak comprehension we begin 
to taste they without sense do not diversity 
whet appetite anew 

yet so much change 
shall make invention barren but it be fruitful 
pregnant and teem as fast as it be deliver 
delicious Capua 

pleasure only storehouse 
be I a Hannibal and conquest quiet i 
as fair as daylight spread his crystal wing 
one Capua shall ransom all 

what be here 
Shee court he with as earnest zeal as Cynthia 
will her Endymion or the grayeyed morn 
her early Shafalus 

now by my sword 

be that a soldier oath in Capua 
by the bright tress of my mistress hair 
fine as Arachne web or gossimer 
who curl when garnish with their dress show 
like that spin vapour when it be pearl with dew 
or by the sunshine of her crystal eye 
wherein the god of love his wet wing dry 
after his bathe in sad lover tear 
these be the only oath a soldier swear 
what shall we do with sword 

Indeed it be true 
their bloody use have be so long neglect 
and for my part I be so cloy with woman 
i must be fill to powder and prepare 
to be their physic the greensickness else 
will not be cure by i 

i shall be draw 
to wear for pin and that which oft have reign 
the blood of roman on my hilt and hand 
weary almost with slaughter shall be touch 
with tremble finger white as Othris snow 
while the soft handler start if by mischance 
the point but prick her skin and must consult 
with some learned unguentary to prevent 
the invisible scar why here we can quarrel 
among ourselves for wench there be a lady 
as mean a beauty heretofore have be 
the ground of a sad war or in a camp 
serve up a mutiny we can envy it 
that he a common soldier valour cipher 
one only press to make the number up 
enjoy she whole and perhaps have change 

nay stand upon nice term for his reward 
and must be hire to pleasure such as some 
will even through any danger to embrace 
prithee observe 

why shall I be deny 
be I not fair enough my beauty fresh 
as the new spring when wanton Phoebus mount 
his burnish chariot early to salute she 
and kiss dew from her cheek 

there be as fair 
and free a pension lady must be think of 
I can else be sportive 

be that all 
I will full thy burgonet with iberian gold 
stamp into medal sell my wanton treasury 
ring jewel carcanet ere thou shall want 
but what thy wish can covet 

this old buff 
will be translate 

into persian mantle 
rich embroider no rough pelt of thrumb 
to fight with weather shall be clothe in silk 
such as may vie for touch with their softness 
when it be calm and no violent gust 
do wave it into wrinkle 

I must eat too 

nothing but choice caudy and drink wine 
that shall have pearl dissolve in it come let we hasten 
to our delight I have prepare a bed 
of artificial rose mix with down 
wherein our dalliance we will emulate 
the cyprian queen and she love warrior 
when in her ivory arm she do embrace 
his iron side 

soft lady there be yet 
strict condition I be not come to that 
I must not be confine to time or place 
nor to your single number I must change 
as I see cause 

shall be thy own disposer 
he minister and like a handmaid wait 
when thou will grace another nor repine 
but with a patient longing 

on these term 
I feel a provocation Come exeunt 

do ease 
ever before produce such act of shame 

no matter it be a better life than war 
afford her son a hard cold bed of earth 
sleep break with a thousand apprehension 
of danger diet course and seldom seasonable 
hunger and thirst and death each hour present 
let we translate our Carthage unto Capua 
we shall not need to toil in blood and sweat 
for more enlargement 

how do he like this softness it agree not 
with his rough nature 

music every place 
surfeit with this lasciviousness 

they be my lord 
most absolute 

and you be please with they 

they can be refuse be offer we 
so pay after labour as the fruit 
and harvest of our pain what stupid earth 
can be so void of apprehension 
as not to think they blessing 

that can Hannibal 
who through the swarthy vizard age and care 
have tan his face with blush at the change 
of soldier into woman why in stead 
of Plumecrowned crest wear you not tire and deck 
your neck with gem in stead of arm they 
with corslet lay by all command save only 
to set your distaffservant task and study 
lascivious dress not war discipline 
better employ invention how to court 
a mistress in the fashionable garb 
than to contrive a useful stratagem 
where force prevail not 

who have we to sight with 
lead we again to action we will express 
a courage double by this little rest 
and from the hope of such another conquest 
we will act wonder to make victory 
dote on our valour 

you like carthaginian 
speak from the sonles of man muster your soldier 
we will again to Rome and with the terror 
of our approach make earthquake in the heart 
of her gown senator burn the proud trophy 
adorn she Capitol or make they scarecrow 
bury she highascending tower in heap 
of their own ruin and till tyber die 
with blood of his own child not a arm 
shall cease from slaughter have we cut our way 
through mountain and thaw rock of ice for passage 
to reach the head of Rome and shall we not 
triumph in her rich spoil yes we will triumph 
or by the genius of my native Carthage 
and the religious oath I make my father 
when yet my youth have see the progress but 
of nine sun through the twelve celestial mansion 
I will level all the rugged Apennines 
and mount the humble valley till their head 
be wrap in cloud whence thunder shall not force i 
till I survey the plain of Italy 
like earth manure chalk with the bone of roman 
after their flesh be bury in the gorge 
of kite and vulture 

speak like Hannibal 

what lady be that 

she be of Salapia 

she be lovely what unusual passion 
soften i on a sudden I methinks 
can play with air and wanton with the breath 
of such a mistress court she amorous 
and not mistake a phrase nor fright her tenderness 
with any repetition of war horror 
cease your rebellion thought I must be man 
and keep my freedom 

do observe his eye 
how it be fix 

what do creation mean 
a woman for but pleasure shall not I 
pursue it then since it be the end of all 
we either do or wish it be action soul 
that make it live I must enjoy it this way 
desire be a law set down by nature counsel 
and not to be dispute 

so my lord 
example shall direct we we may well 
if Hannibal turn courtier 

one at once 
sweet gentleman though I shall covet change 
at once I will not admit plurality 

to you fair storehouse of your sex excellence 
I will direct the language of my heart 

it be sure a noble dialect my lord 
that must express it 

lady it can speak 
nothing but passion you have wound it 
and from the self same eye that shoot the dart 
I must have balm to cure it 

you be my lord 
a conqueror and may command the will 
of all beneath you 

but I be your captive 
and in that pleasant bondage will abide 
though I may force my ransom 

violence 
will it become those virtue same proclaim we 
to have possess you and I dare be confident 
nothing can tempt you to turn ravisher 
though I shall boast virginity 

suspect 
of such a ill wrong be your own innocence 
my love be zealous and the passive flame 
feed with a pure desire I will enjoy you 
to mix our soul not mere to delight 
the wanton sense 

how can you a man 
who custom have habituate in the extreme 
of cruelty change nature and perhaps 
your first innate and not a second only 
bear out of use methinks it be not possible 
your thought shall be possess of other object 
then what war horror paint with bloody colour 
love and a lady be for such as case 
have soften into woman Hannibal 
have nothing in he but what be masculine 
so harden too that those weak sire can never 
alter his temper 

yes your eye have do it 
although my skin be horny and my flesh 
almost insensible through daily weight 
of heavy arm the substance of my heart 
be flexible and take impression 
of love from your perfection it not derogate 
from the best difference in man composition 
to love for that best speak he man and argue 
he have a spirit capable of thing 
worthy his being Come then perfect i 
with your addition make my captivity 
a conquest and I will fix 

that be enough 
to brand you with a last infamy 
you have design for action shall you stop 
the prosecution of a war begin 
with such success and only for a woman 
to will make you be the scorn of man the subject 
of jester libel I can court your valour 
as you be Hannibal but as a lover 
the thought of that cool all affection 
have I at Cannae be or Thrasimenus 
gird in a amazonian male my head 
wrap in a iron tiara and my hand 
arm with a sword I will have keep the side 
of Hannibal to dote upon those wonder 
his conquer arm then act 

as from water 
cast on bitumen so from these sharp check 
my flame increase you express a soul 
make other valour but derivative 
from you as if the spring of all flow thence 
and we but drink our small proportion 
from your abundance our embrace will 
people the waste world with warrior 

whence speak your haste and what 

I come from Spain 
and bring important news but sad 

shall we 
by change ride through the zodiac of your pleasure 
and feast ourselves in every house 

you still 
mistake the sign 

it be not in virgo sure 

nor yet in Taurus though I have a husband 
you two be gemini a pair of captain 

Shee flout we sure 

what shall this courtship mean 
maharball and Himulco that be character 
for valiant captain turn sinocksouldier 
and Hannibal 

the air of Capua 
have not so change we but we can preserve 
our modesty 

o miracle that Capua 
have honest woman in it 

will Hannibal 
attend my message 

have thou bring she pearl 
ravish from neck of rich roman dame 
I will pave the path we tread to Hymen joy 
with spoil of all the city I have conquer 

not of new Carthage Sagunt Locris Tarracon 
all these be reovercome by Scipio 
in Spain he only triumph 

do not Hannibal 
mind the sad news revenge if nothing else 
shall wing he to new conquest 

I perceive 
error in my behaviour court a woman 
when I shall threaten vengeance but she be fair 
hang beauty that and ease be the only engine 
to ruin virtue lady pray withdraw 
the affair of man be handle 

may they prove 
your honour more in valour than in love exeunt 

I be prepare and if there be a accident 
that do exceed in horror praise or wonder 
discourse it lively that it may impress 
something within to beget a act 
shall parallel it 

that must be new Carthage 
her siege and take when the roman general 
approach the wall a cold fear shake her genius 
the earth groan with weight of such a multitude 
his navy likewise at that instant make 
a cloud upon the sea so round about 
the city be begirt our resolution 
mix with despair soon arm we and the assault 
be sudden we do do before consider 
yet what we do thus with the wall height prove 
successful we have respite to advice 
the sea we think sufficient to defend 
that pait it wash and direct all 
our force to the Isthmus where we sally forth 
the enemy retire but out of policy 
to draw we far on and now the sun 
survey we from his height when sudden 
a violent northwind join with the ebb 
sweep all the channel dry of which the roman 
be inform by certain fisherman 
seize the opportunity and free pass 
to the unman wall enter without resistance 
what more they be full conqueror do 
need no relation custom shew it Hannibal 
the example make some other city yield 
some policy win some force some treachery 
deliver up all be possess by Scipio 

then Rome shall ransom they revenge be able 
out of a flinty cowardice to strike 
the fire of valour with that new supply 
I do expect from Carthage we will to Rome 
and emulate this victory nor let it 
be your affliction that blind chance have robe 
your former labour of their due reward 
Rome will repair all 

I must then 
deliver a relation of ingratitude 
beyond example those who you have make 
master of wealth and honour and release 
their palsy age from many a coward fear 
not mind the rich benefit you have do they 
deny your need relief if you want aid 
they say your conquest be but a lie rumour 
nor will they credit doubtful testimony 
of any present they not stick to call 
the ground of this your war in Italy 
your own ambition not their safety malice 
of Hanno faction have frame pretence 
to cloud the glory of your action 
which to confirm the more see their command 
that you shall instant withdraw your force 
and to return to Carthage 

not till now 
when in my talon I have almost seize 
Rome eagle and prepare my sharpen beak 
to prey upon her hair 

it be likewise fear 
that Massanissa have forsake Carthage 
so that unless some policy can win 
Syphax unto we we must never more 
expect numidian aid his counsellor 
seem to desire it for they wish your presence 
and that you will put the instruction here contain 
into a sudden act 

must I then leave 
Rome unsubvert So a man that strive 
to make himself eternal by erect 
of some stupendous monument be force 
to his last quiet ere the work be perfect 
leave it but a lame and half design 
of his ambition 

have not Hannibal 
his force here let we forward with that strength 
which yet be leave we nor regard the tie 
their dote policy will chain we with 
valour consist in heart more than in number 
let we on to Rome 

no passion shall submit 
unto my best part conquest of myself 
shall speak i more in this then if my power 
have level she seven hill I leave she only 
to grow more worthy of my victory 
I will obey though each unwilling step 
wound i beyond the cure of common patience 
command of power must not be withstand 
great action make man great good action good 

it will prove I fear lame policy to halt 
betwixt these faction awe by two such spirit 
as never be still from envy or revenge 

brave Hannibal brave Scipio great Carthage 
but great Rome who eagle eye have gaze 
against the sun of many a glorious triumph 
when the bright beam reflect from their riches 
have blind daylight as if heaven great eye 
borrow his only from they 

Carthage be 
oar ancient friend and friendship long continue 
shall not be easy lose 

a useful tenet 
where the condition be private but in king 
it do not hold war chance be variable 
and he that now be victor may be conquer 
before his peace be settle from example 
we must consult our safety more than from 
a moral precept have not Scipio 
get Spain from Hannibal and join unto he 
massilia king be not their army flush 
with the rich spoil of Sagunt and who know 
but they will transport then force and begird 
Carthage itself it be better that we yield 
free to amity than be compel 
than Scipio must be welcome 

but if fortune 
prosper my counterplot he will be greet 
with a affront shall cloud his entertainment 
and dim the paint glory of that pomp 
your compliment intend our youthful king 
must not direct our counsel nor affair 
of state be order by the affection 
of one so weak in policy indulgent 
to his own passion Carthage be set down 
by our experience for numidia love 
and shall possess it 

we may then consider 
the carthaginian general be a man 
wear with employment into more decay 
of strength and year than can give any hope 
of a continuance Rome green champion 
be full of grow sap to make he spread 
while the other like a age oak that long 
have fight with tempest and withstand the rage 
of burn air now yield to every gust 
a bough or arm till one more violent 
shatter the dry limb or quite root it up 
it be better to provide for last state 
then mere to prevent a present fate 
then Scipio must be welcome 

but if Syphax 
will hear our reason 

Crates you have be 
our worthy counsellor and by your wisdom 
steer government in a right course while yet 
our youth do want it but we be now grow 
Riper in judgement and we can distinguish to they messenger 
the different ground of any politic act 
nor do we find it safe in rule of state 
if Scipio be not welcome what be your haste 

the roman general be arrive and enter 

and no feign thunder to inform we of it 
from the loud voice of flock multitude 
shall throng to bid he welcome 

he be scarce know 
to any but myself his train be private 
without due state only some needful servant 
to wait upon his person 

be they his army 
I will exhaust my treasury to feast they 
and every common soldier shall drink health 
in his corinthian goblet which shall be 
his largesse likewise let our minister 
fill the shrill throat of war loud instrument 
And dodonean brass be beat deaf 
while it proclaim his welcome let the sea 
echo the sound to sagant and return 
their shoot again flourish 

I will not answer 
your kindness Syphax with a compliment 
my tongue be not oil with flattery I have steal 
a little time from action to inform 
numidia king how Rome by my advice 
have choose he a favourer of her cause 
that suffer by false Carthage the success 
of my recover Spain have give new hope 
unto her faint spirit that be near 
their last expire by the massacre 
the carthaginian make six consul have 
already fall my father and my uncle 
Sempronius Terentius and Flaminius 
and last Marcellus who receive his death 
even in the sight of Rome yet there be a Scipio 
survive to conquer he or die in the enterprise 

and that brave Scipio shall not want what aid 
my person or my kingdom can afford he 

Rome shall make great esteem of Syphax friendship 
and when she shall be wrap in silken wing 
of victory and peace his statue crown 
shall grace the triumph 

I shall rather joy 
to see he chain a captive though myself 
and family be sell to be his ransom 
in Carthage quarrel 

this cold entertainment 
do make i jealous 

see how soon their eye 
have find each other 

sure it be Hannibal 
his name and nature be stamp upon his brow 
I in those wrinkle read it valour mix 
with cruelty to which ambition only 
as the first wheel in engine move the rest 
that eye he lose pass the fen of Arnus 
and such a look his counterfeit be draw with 
if there be treachery 

what will Hannibal 

be it Hannibal we be betray by Syphax 

what art 

Rome general and thy enemy 

ha Scipio then the character report 
give we of he be false he scorn ignoble way 
of honour to overcome by treachery 

I think the same of Hannibal 

and find it 
it be only thy conspiracy with Syphax 
who make his court a privilege for that 
fame will proclaim with blush 

why this uproar 

Syphax thou be treacherous 

to Rome and Scipio 

to Hannibal and Carthage 

now observe 
how he will calm the tempest 

what to answer 
from sudden doubt you both possess i with 
I can easy resolve a jealousy 
be sometime strengthen by the excuse shall kill it 
yet if your confidence will give credit to 
a king religious oath by all that make 
the sacred difference in i I be free 
from thought of ill to either your arrival 
be unexpected and if either danger 
be smother in intent you bring it with you 
which I will prevent if all numidia strength 
can do it think not i perfidious 
for then I will doubt you since self evil be 
most common the parent of suspicion 
but for your own mistrust you be safe here 
than in your own camp guard with a maze 
of your best soldier 

it be a satisfaction 
I bless the occasion make we meet my long 
be violent to see thou Scipio 

my more to see thou Hannibal but rather 
arm in the field prepare for a encounter 
then here to parley 

doubt not such a greeting 
when next we meet 

I needs must interpose 
and moderate this contention pray my lord 
let i be powerful to dispose your temper 
for other mild impression that my court 
for entertain two such enemy 
at once be make discourse for afterage 
a banquet wait you music usher it music 
thus peace bid soldier welcome 

Syphax no 
think of Rome cause and let your feast be season 
with say to that if thou prove treacherous 
expect a vengeance justice never yet 
give severe execution to a great 
I must be go the affair of war attend i 
when I have settle Rome peace we will comply 
in the effect action till then must live 
by blood and labour Hannibal farewell 
next greeting will be rough 

not to be calm 
with word Grow strong be still a conqueror 
till I shall conquer thou 

thou be but flatter 
by a ambition vain than thy dream 
ten carthage and Hannibal will not weigh 
equal with the achievement 

one Hannibal 
and Carthage poise but in a equal scale 
with twenty Rome and twenty Scipio 
shall weigh like lead against feather 

proud insister 
upon his own slight merit Remember Syphax 
thy vow have make thou Rome 

which I will preserve 
as sacred inviolate as if 
eternal seal have ratify it usher 
the roman general forth flourish exeunt 

have word such power 
upon our general to deject he thus 

my brain be labour 

I will help to deliver it 

as giddy fancy when they do present 
delightful shadow seem to please the sense 
when it be quiet and not capable 
of any object till the dreamer joy 
sudden wake he and the false impression 
vanish to their first nothing so have I 
flatter my hope 

I prophesy success 
despite of Scipio Syphax counsellor 
who secret correspondency with we 
teach the great mean by which their master love 
must be regain a long experience 
confirm our friend then prosecute it thorough 

my lord till now the accident 
cause by the roman presence do prevent we 
from give satisfaction to your doubt 
which be but just ground our young king 
be full of his youthful passion and so violent 
in the prosecution of they counsel rather 
do set a keen edge upon his appetite 
we therefore give he way but if we can 
reduce his action to a rule of judgement 
we will open oppose he or conspire 
as against a tyrant that make will his law 
see he be return be confident 

how whisper 
I do suspect 

if Syphax dare be private 

dare Hannibal have thou intent more black 
than ever night give execution to 
even in Carthage senate house as well 
as in my own court I dare stand the encounter 
of single Hannibal withdraw 

they must not 
the wrong thou have do Carthage must be witness 
that when fame speak they loud partial man 
make not their incredulity a excuse 
for what no satisfaction can restore 
thy honour lose in infamy 

thou tempt i 
with these dark preface yet thy upbraid 
do seem so frivolous my patience rather 
laugh at their vainness clear my understanding 
without more circumstance for yet my innocence 
Know not to accuse myself unless forgive 
thy saucy taunt a privilege 

what error 
but to defend itself will strive though vain 
to mock truth out of truth well Syphax know 
the expectation of a state delude 
can but trouble it a king be more 
than a mean person bound with dimension 
of the bare man his action be his people 
and what he do or suffer they must stand 
Consider then when Carthage shall call up 
revenge and with all force pursue the injury 
to satisfaction when her soldier 
who custom have make pitiless shall plough 
the womb of teem mother with their falchion 
to prevent the issue that may vindicate 
a father slay make your numidian virgin 
the ruin of their pleasure and not leave 
a altar to your god nor private lar 
that may defend a household from their violence 
when these who very repetition carry 
horror enough to fright man into peace 
shall happen 

when they shall it rather seem 
a positive threat Tell Carthage be her power 
of a extent that limit can not bind 
with any circumscription I will not fear it 
to die for Rome be above victory 
furnish ten thousand choice numidian horseman 
to wait on Scipio why be our command 
no more respect I will have execution 
forerun my edict that concern the good 
of Rome and Scipio stand you like dull statue 
fix to their first foundation when your diligence 
shall borrow speed from wind as if you rid 
on the contract air to hasten it 

full well their age wise with experience know 
to disobey a king unjust command 
law and religion warrant Syphax youth 
be fit to court beauty than to sit 
at a state helm and steer the various course 
it be subject to by his green violent passion 
with which his bed ere this have be enrich 
have Carthage find he kind fair Sophonisba 

that name have startle he 

she from who eye 
the amorous sun resign first his own 
may be ambitious to derive new fire 
yet she to be reserve for his embrace 
who slight that honour all the neighbour king 
have be competitor for and will lay down 
their crown to purchase sell their very being 
to be translate into a possession 
of Sophonisba 

it begin to work 

whence do the intent of this great honour to i 
derive itself 

from a desire of friendship 
and league with Syphax which his passionate love 
to Rome and Scipio that admit no reason 
deny I must publish the dishonour 
do to a lady at who least command 
a nation shall be arm lead by such captain 
as in their emulation will declare 
what mortal owe to her divine perfection 
that warrant her revenge as just a quarrel 
as ever stir up valour in a conscience 
scruple have coward here my commission 
take end and I must go 

stay Hannibal 
strange passion war against my resolution 
and love begin to circle i in flame 
ere my eye take the fire what be Rome or Scipio 
to Sophonisba in who rich beauty 
mor comprehend than the macedonian 
can from his many conquest and subversion 
of monarchy boast himself owner of 
what be a king promise but a politic 
and that be allow evasion to gain time 
for counsel with his will I will be for Carthage 
to enjoy Sophonisba I be inflame 
from the report and if my sense find 
truth answer fame great Hannibal shall lead 
numidia power against Rome or any place 
he have design for conquest 

but if Syphax 
shall again suffer Scipio menacy 
to fright his weakness out of this resolve I 

my weakness tempt i not with a suspect 
let i have Sophonisba or I will make 
a rape upon your Carthage not on she 
for what delight vbz in violence inquire 
the cause of that loud shout shout within messenger 

I come to inform you 
a stately ship from her rich lade womb 
have on our shore deliver such a train 
of glorious virgin that attend on one 
who lead the rest 

no more it be Sophonisba 

receive she with religious ceremony 
perfume the air with incense rich than 
the phoenix funeral pile let harmony music 
breath out her soul at every artist touch 
Cover the pavement which her step must hallow 
with persian tapestry how I be ravish 
with the expectation and like some light matter 
catch in a whirlwind all my faculty 
be hurry forward 

can thy sense distinguish 
see Syphax thus I deign to show thou that 
king have be proud to worship 

ere I embrace 
let i admire in each eye sit a Cupid 
who as he skip about to shoot his dart 
be himself fetter in the golden curl 
that deck her brow Elysium but a fable 
and that eternity the poet dream of 
serve but to figure this 

although my difference 
may challenge more I be not ambitious 
of shallow praise my spirit must fly high 
to catch at fame not flattery 

come you not 
to love i then 

I do but not to think 
all your expression though they be extend 
beyond my wish can merit it 

I be 
a king and you methinks shall court the fortune 
with a glad readiness to share my honour 
and to be make my equal 

be you more 
I be above addition in myself 
and shall be lessen if I do confine 
a thought to any person and the act 
include nothing but bare satisfaction 
of a desire I will not let a smile 
fall loose from i but shall be attend 
by action worth their history which read 
shall with the apprehension of my greatness 
amaze posterity 

can Sophonisba 
be covetous of more than the earth honour 
when she shall sit encompass in a ring 
of noble matron that shall deify 
her beauty with their praise when she shall 
be crown with sparkle wreath to blind the gazer 
as if a constellation have be robe 
to make she shine when in a king arm sleep 
all pleasure shall be minister that nature 
and art in their contention strive to own 
and take their glory from 

I hire pretty bait 
to catch a easy wanton who dull earth 
a little varnish over do know itself 
no far than the superficial tincture 
discover in her glass I have a soul 
great than Syphax kingdom and to bound it 
will take from what I be it will be your honour 
above all that your ambition can direct you 
to hope for next eternity if I 
vouchsafe to add unto your petty royalty 
my great self and the addition be 
great than you can purchase by your conquest 
it be but her due when Sophonisba crave 
world for her kingdom their king for her slave 
shall Syphax make a resignation 
of all he own be for i it be but as if 
he pare a molehill from the earth to place 
a Atlas in its stead 

Come Sophonisba 
you must consent there be fame in it that will give you 
a everlasting be in the memory 
of benefit your country will derive from it 
child shall first be teach to speak your name 
and from their age grandsire learn your story 
who often repetition shall take from 
the tediousness of age and make they seem 
as if they dance for joy when palsy shake they 

be I enslame and shall I not enjoy 
mock i not lady into a despair 
you show i heaven and shut the gate against i 
make not a king that deign to be your servant 
a slave unto your cruelty 

to give 
Syphax a satisfaction your competitor 
false Massanissa he that share your kingdom 
and will engross it all have long solicit 
for Sophonisba love 

o Massanissa 

he have now forsake Carthage she 
out of her piety to do her country 
a good prefer you and that her revenge 
may be pursue with great violence 
allow her elf your right though she be a treasure 
may be dispose of to a more advantage 
of Carthage strength 

will Sophonisba love then 
if I fight carthag quarrel 

yes your fortune 
Whilst it be at height but the least declination 
wave it to a ebb I from that fall 
must mount to high honour if a gale 
meet it to raise i 

massanissa person 
it seem can limit your desire 

he be 
a man make up of fire no gross earth clog 
his spirit when it will mount to honour top 
and load same with his act have he not fall 
from Carthage Sophonisba have but be 
the price of his desert and yet I love he 
dear Massanissa 

she have overcome i 
I will be great every day action 
shall raise i a step high and I will take 
you with i lady no you shall lead i 
the tribute I will pay for every kiss 
shall be a victory over your enemy 
proud Rome shall find Syphax can be a soldier 
when Sophonisba bid he put on steel 

the not to be resist power of beauty 
Carthage I will salute thou now with joy 
nor shall the thought of thy ingratitude 
make i less willing to pursue thy good 
through a deep sea of vanquish roman blood 

we will feast than fight who lead by such bright eaves 
will not match on to any enterprise exennt 

Syphax so soon revolt I what weak man 
will mock away his safety child thus 
play with fire to please their foolish sense 
be often burn and make their sport the instrument 
of their own danger Massanissa yet 
be constant and by this time have subdue he 
success must follow those attempt that rise 
from a just cause and crown the enterprise 
Lelius what news 

I labour with the event 
joy hinder a delivery Massanissa 
gird in a conquest great never make 
a triumph glorious be return back 
to present Scipio with numidia spoil 
and Syphax captive 

it be a joyful errant 
just Nemesis thy griffin have be swift 
and bear thou well to see the execution 
of a revenge upon perfidious Syphax 
have thou fail in it we just may disclaim 
thy deity and without fear of punishment 
profane thy altar on who marble now 
we will pay a sacrifice of rich flame 
mix with the blood of king discourse the progress 
to this event 

when your successful policy 
have destroy both the camp of Asdrubal 
and Syphax with devour fire who flame 
seem to the distant gazer on it a prodigy 
that threaten dissolution and beget 
their great fear then when the artillery 
of heaven speak loud through the burn air 
to tell the world jove angry when you retire 
to Utica to prevent a invasion 
intend by the carthaginian navy 
which dark the sea much like a cloud of praetor 
that be convent after some great fight 
to glut their ravenous gorge with the gore 
thousand of soulless man lie reek in 
the mad numidian king in who despair 
have kindle a new valour gather head 
and with a fresh supply of unman man 
for have they be such as experience 
have teach the useful order of a war 
the end have again be doubtful give we battle 
their first assault make we retire yet still 
we keep the sudden form have put we in 
for best advantage till their heedless courage 
hurry they on where our foot legion 
observe their disorder for they fight 
in throng so thick that many time one strike 
wound his fellow give they new resistance 
at which they stop mate with apprehension 
of their own danger who the incense king 
mix his threat with promise of honour 
labour be to bring one till his horse be kill 
we take he prisoner with two thousand more 
the rest not flame be flee 

brave victory 
worthy the achiever to who memory 
eternal statue shall be raise and trophy 
rich as Rome Capitol be glorious with 
but where be Massanissa 

he pretend 
to visit Cirtha Syphax chief city 
which be deliver up 

I have new fear flourish 
that woman will again bewitch he know 
the cause 

it be Massanissa 

the only wealth 
I will be possess of I embrace in thou 
a boundless treasure 

let not Scipio 
flatter i into pride for what be rather 
fortune than i 

the action of thy virtue 
fortune be a under power that be herself 
command by desert it be a mere vainness 
of our credulity to give she more 
than her due attribute which be but servant 
to a heroic spirit 

this example 
may instance proof for her divinity 
all be but endeavour until perfect 
by the success and that be fortune only 
desert share little in she 

let not thy modesty 
maintain such error to refuse just praise 
be a extreme worse than man overween 
opinion of himself great Massanissa 
shall have all honour due unto his conquest 
and wear triumphant garland that false king 
chain to his chariot from the gazer eye 
invite scorn not pity 

it be not manly 
to insult over misery to which 
thyself be as subject and perhaps may feel 
chance make prosperity when it be at high 
but pastime to delight her giddy humour 
and will deject the most seem possessor 
when she command a restitution 
of her lend favour that she may confer they 
upon another this consideration 
may invite mercy 

when superior justice 
make we her instrument shall we be partial 
I the execution it be to mock the power 
and call down vengeance yet I grieve for Syphax 
that he deserve the punishment who weakness 
suffer a piece of paint earth to tempt he 
from his religion and neglect the god 
who he invoke for witness to that vow 
a woman make he violate 

it be my hope 
she may deceive thou too and with her charm 
bewitch the boast conqueror that be her slave 
from his faith to Rome 

his madness will betray i 
to a reproach 

it take from my own suffering 
to see my enemy in the same danger 
when he by his adulterous embrace 
receive the like infection into he soul 
that make i sick of virtue and of all 
but my disease 

do you enjoy the lady 

yes she be my wife 

your act be somewhat rash 
before her husband death do the religion 
you pay numidia god warrant it law full 

Syphax be dead in his captivity 
his life be i which I but lend he only 
for Rome great triumph 

we will consult a little 
and then dispose you Syphax 

as your will 
advise you it be the curse of greatness 
to be it be own destruction so we see 
that mountain cedar have the least defence 
against storm when shrub confront their violence exeunt 

when first you free do commit yourself 
unto my charge and promise with a vow 
my like only shall dispose your action 
either you love they or your flattery 
pretend admiration of some virtue 
you think possess i one I must confess 
I glory to be master of that be continence 
I have converse with beauty rich as nature 
do ever make art proud to counterfeit 
may have command some that conquest give i 
yet have I still keep out desire but you 
have yield to that passion do betray 
a weakness in you will obscure the glory 
of all your other goodness think how dangerous 
it be to a young man on who expectation 
opinion eye be fix to mix his action 
with wanton pleasure when his thought transfer 
the wicked object of his humorous sense 
unto his soul that poison all her faculty 
and make they useless noble Massanissa 
your good deed sing by fame be music to i 
your error I have rather you yourself 
will silent consider and reform 
before with any show of least unkindness 
you force i to reprove they 

let not Scipio 
deny those error a excuse if nature 
have a like clothe man disposition 
and all do wear one habit of the mind 
you need not urge the example of your own 
to instruct another continence for all 
from a necessity and innate temperance 
will be as you be though I do not boast 
command over pleasure I pursue they not 
with a intemperate appetite but make 
reason my guide that tell we i to provide 
for a succession do become the judgement 
of a wise king posterity may well 
be call the eternity of life he never 
die that have issue for which I have marry 
her my own conquest give i 

your own conquest 
pray do not arrogate too much you must not 
dispose Rome prisoner while you fight her quarrel 
the war be not you though you the victory 
she must attend her sentence from our senate 
which hardly will be partial to her beauty 
though it be adulterate with more art 
then ever lasciviousness be mistress of 
and rack it invention for let Sophonisba 
be then deliver up 

perhaps yourself 
after your boast continence will have she 
to be your own 

be that your jealousy 
weak passionate man that through thy blind reason 
foresee not thy own danger by the example 
of other misery and yet be ripe 
to maintain gross error of thy will 
and seem discretion master have not Syphax 
bewitch by magic of her wanton eye 
into a dotage break his faith with Rome 
he may have flourish in his height of glory 
and still command over his division 
which Rome will add to massanissa kingdom 
yield up Sophonisba 

you will seem 
to give i mine upon condition 
I shall restore the gold reserve only 
the earth to trample on in Sophonisba 
I have a treasure my own life shall ransom 
if she be force away and to consent 
she shall be yield up to any roman 
be worse than sacrilege though I shall scare 
the hallow statue of nunsidia god 
down from their altar and convert their temple 
into the loathsome use of necessity 
king oath be equal with decree of fate 
those I have make I can violate 

then I disclaim thou there be not so much danger 
in a know foe as a suspect friend 
to prevent a incendium it be best 
to quench a brand before it fire the rest Exit 

he be angry and I must not let it grow 
to ripeness of his hate I be resolve 
to be the example of a constancy 
fame shall proclaim for wonder 

why be my lord 
thus cloudy I expect entertainment 
of other difference such as cheerful love 
present desire with from the interchange 
of smile and amorous glance 

Sophonisba 
I be new enter into meditation 
of death and other wretchedness depend 
upon mortality 

be that the argument 
of your dejectedness it shew too much 
of woman weakness man shall have a spirit 
above the fear any consideration 
can work within he death be but a entrance 
to our eternity and if our life 
merit a blessedness hereafter we 
shall run with joy to meet it 

but if one 
possess of happiness beyond the hope 
of any great that deny another 
can be in expectation more than what 
his soul enjoy already apprehend 
a separation from it by the malice 
of death or other accident it will force he 
weep silent within though shame restrain 
his outward tear 

this circumstance will seem 
to prepare something that shall have relation 
unto yourself or i perhaps the consul 
have urge that I shall be deliver up 
to Rome dispose massanissa vow 
make with religious ceremony can 
if he respect the god consent to it 
and rather than their tyranny shall make i 
wretched anew to my first earth return i 
the worst remain of Sophonisba 

dare she 
die then to quit her fear 

and meet the instrument 
with great cheerfulness than fond parent 
can show at the return of their decree child 
from long captivity this tender frame 
lodge a masculine and heroic spirit 
and if thy passionate love deny thyself 
to be the actor in this benefit 
give i thy sword my own right hand shall guide 
the point unto my heart I will without tremble 
open a passage for the crimson drop 
and smile to see they diaper the pavement 
as if it be some conceit workmanship 
make by the looker fancy 

ere my eye 
shall suffer such a object to offend 
their hitherto please sense I will dissolve they 
in their own humour no Sophonisba 
this breath shall first waste into empty air 
and leave my naked bone in the hallow pile 
ere I prove false to thou give i some wine 
I will drink a bridal health to Sophonisba 
and mix it with Nepenthe here be the juice 
will cause forgetfulness and mock the extremity 
of any adverse fortune messenger with wine 

sure it be poison 
will Massanissa leave i then unguarded 
to Scipio violence I have here no father 
nor uncle to defend i not so much 
as a poor tear by weep to stir up 
a roman pity I shall only dart 
a anger from my burn eye to show 
the carthaginian spirit I be bear with 
which not with stand will not quit this part 
from a captivity this Scipio rage 
will hurry in his triumph to be gaze at 
and scorn by the course rabble do not then 
by such a keep of it break thy vow 
for it be no less to i I must still want 
the benefice of such a constancy 
for though himself live not to yield i up 
I be expose to it and without least power 
to make resistance let i then partake 
that mean of best security 

not to have 
a monument of last adamant 
raise to my memory no Sophonisba 
this be no potion to preserve a beauty 
in it be first green or ripe it to a summer 
or prevent the autumn or return the winter 
into a new spring this will pale the dye 
which thy cheek blush when it will clothe modesty 
in a rich scarlet make that ivory breast 
now love soft bed whereon he play be the wanton 
and ambush himself to catch the flame 
he shoot at other from thy eye as cold 
as scythian sand bleak with continual freeze 
into a seem crystal Scipio dare not 
insult over thou thy face will check his malice 
into a silent admiration of it 
or if he sin so much as to deject thou 
with the least fear of ill the god themselves 
will leave their immortality to be 
each other rival in thy love and strive 
which shall revenge thou best this must not weaken 
what be so powerful 

if my lord be then 
resolve to leave i widow be yet 
scarce warm in his embrace let i mix 
a tear with his last drink that he may carry 
something of Sophonisba with he 

that 
have in it sufficient virtue to convert 
all the thessalian pontic phasian aconite 
into preservative and turn this draught 
into a antidote which yet be powerful 
above all that art and nature in conspiracy 
of mischief ever invent we that be 
great and yet subject to the incertainty 
of fortune have this custom to prevent it 
we affect glory and conclude no slate 
that end be not in itself be fortunate 
So offer to drink 

let my lord first give i leave to breathe 
a errant over it that when he be enter 
Elysium throng of carthaginian hero 
may bid he welcome and inform themselves 
from he of Sophonisba 

do it then quick 
I will bear it and command the king of night 
resign his ravish queen to be thy handmaid 
hell I shall now be arm to meet thy horror 
with great power than thou 

if there be fate 
why be it conceal the revelation of it 
will make we strive to mock eternal providence 
the ingenious artist that do form this cup 
foresee not such a use of it have he know 
it shall have minister death to a king 
his tremble hand can never have finish it 
with such exactness what so ever decree 
be write in the adamantine table 
of destiny we must subscribe to time 
though he keep on his swift and silent pace 
death be sure at first or last to win the race 
pray keep out Scipio I have almost end 
So drink be 

ha what have Sophonisba madness do 
o Aesculapius if thy deity 
be not a feign one then administer 
and show it powerful in restore back 
my Sophonisba to her former safety 
Numidia shall pay worship to none other 
but thou and Phoebus altar shall be raise 
make of iberian gold and flame with incense 
until Arabia rich earth grow barren 
of gum and spice 

why do Massanissa 
invoke vain aid the god be merciful 
in their deny it and it be but justice 
that I shall die my adulterous easiness 
deserve it that without the least resistance 
leave my yet live husband to embrace 
his enemy but it have warrant from 
the end my country good and the first love 
I bear thou Massanissa now let Scipio 
boast of his conquest Sophonisba be 
her own subverter it begin to work 
with a full strength my blood will serve to heat 
a salamander and convert his ice 
into a flame Aetna but paint fire 
to that which burn my marrow yet my look 
be cheerful and erect victory 
be never meet more joyful than I 
embrace that death prevent my misery 
my weak earth totter underneath a weight 
that sink it downward my still live spirit 
ride upon cloud to reach jove high sky 
who fear not death but in the worst part die die 

she be dead sink you supporter of this fabric 
into your deep foundation make they grave 
for your own ruin since there be not leave 
a weight worthy your bear she be not dead 
only she have translate her divinity 
to it be own bless abode and call on i 
to pay a mortal duty shall have sacrifice 
and rich too king out of devotion shall 
offer themselves in flame and from their ash 
rise glorious star whence learned curiosity 
derive a new art shall teach astrologer 
the virtue of a influence shall include 
secret to make credulity astonish 
at their presage I will be their precedent 
and make this earth already consecrate 
with Sophonisba precious foot a altar 
open thy cranny to receive my blood 
and from it be mixture spring a grove of balsam 
lead by who ravish odour the new issue 
of every phoenix shall neglect Panehaia 
to bring her mother spicy death bed hither 
that be likewise her own cradle but this action 
shall have more state and ceremony no 
a king be the priest a king be the sacrifice 
his own sword while it be yet warm with his victory 
shall serve forth axe and so shall I but die then 
I will live to pay she more than the expiration 
of a short breath and die to all delight 
but what I can derive from her fair memory 
which shall be treasure here and by it be virtue 
revive to kill i every life it give 
cause another death 

the lady dead 

to Scipio malice 

can not Massanissa 
acquit himself of one but by commit 
a great folly but I must not chide 
most worthy Massanissa 

keep your flattery 
I have no Sophonisba touch she not 
none but myself shall bear she to the pile 
the sacrilegious hand beside attempt it 
I will cut off your triumph shall not twice 
kill Sophonisba Exit with the body 

with best care attend he 
unto our tent lest that his passion grow 
into a desperate frenzy I must cure it 
by counsel mix with gift in that weak woman 
half Carthage strength be go 

our spy inform 
that the other half which I conceive be Hannibal 
intend upon the event of one great battle 
to hazard all his camp be already pitch 
near Zama whence a messenger be send 
that show the carthaginian much desire 
to have some conference with you 

we will dispose 
our army thitherward methinks I see 
victory crown already clap her wing 
over our head what a strange circulation 
be in time accident from victory 
peace be derive from peace security 
thence lust ambition two main ground of jar 
we fight for peace and peace again breed war exeunt 

pray take no notice that we know the event 
of the late battle I already have 
employ my faction about a peace and Scipio 
be not far off it shall not be the act 
of Hannibal to boast of when we have 
betray he to the roman the condition 
beside be easy 

mind the public Bostar 
do you think it not concern you 

I be my riches 
make i a senator my wisdom never 
deserve the purple be you politic 
let i preserve my state 

your wealth it be grant 
raise you to this high place necessity 
may corrupt justice in a magistrate 
which to prevent at least our jealousy 
our carthaginian custom in election 
of senator sometime prefer the rich 
before the best man take your seat 

to fill it 
fear will not let i sleep 

attend the message 
it seem from Hannibal 

a worthy man 
he send we home three bushel full of ring 
of which I share the most 

before I speak 
methinks the air about i as the sound 
of my sad word do pass through it shall thicken 
into a cloud then melt at every period 
into a weep rain till none be leave 
to give we breathe for sigh Oure Hannibal 
be vanquish by the roman 

we shall then 
have no more wealth bring home nor safe keep 
what we possess already curse on chance 
that mock we thus I will never make her statue 
of gold hereafter and by consequent 
never worship she I have but cold devotion 
towards a wooden goddess 

it be not fit 
evil remediless shall be lament 
from a misfortune something may arise 
to prevent great if it be apply 
with a exact consideration 
of all occurrent that may make it useful 
relate it then 

before the battle join 
the world two captain for beside they none 
merit be the name in equal competition 
meet to have conference where for a space 
they stand astonish at each other presence 
and like two comet tilt in the air 
against one another shoot prodigious flame 
from either eye and with a counterchange 
of fierce and angry look seem to begin 
a eager fight till Hannibal break silence 
and move a peace which Scipio or suspect it 
to be but wont policy or confident 
both of his own strength and success refuse 
then like two cloud swell big with a might tempest 
and hurry forward by contrary wind 
justle each other till their rib be break 
the sulphurous issue fly through the black air 
a inundation follow that will fright 
nature Archaeus from his quiet centre 
to seek a Aetna or vesaevus out 
where he may dry himself so meet the army 
and with a shout that outnoise thunder charge 
each other brave at their first encounter 
mix their blood in stream that every way 
flow like a tide as yet the peaceful goddess 
incline to neither part till Massanissa 
bring up his right wing of numidian horseman 
and break the array enforce our first battle 
back to our second when we be compel 
to fight against our own lest their retire 
may put we out of order till betwixt we 
dead body make a bulwark so that neither 
we nor the roman but by trample on 
our fellow carcase can strike a blow 
of any use the roman legion now 
overpress we with their number and both wing 
of horseman wheel about to assault our rear 
we then be compass yet like angry lion 
who the toil hamper labour for our freedom 
but few escape five hundred only live 
of forty thousand which to Adrumentum 
be flee with Hannibal whence he intend 
to visit Carthage sudden 

his welcome 
if he foreknow it will give he small encouragement 
the incertainty of war do Hannibal 
solicit peace I will seem to oppose it then 
though it intend a good the inborn malice 
betwixt our family will not permit i 
allow his act or counsel by his greatness 
i be eclipse and though this overthrow 
may make he less in popular opinion 
his faction yet be strong 

what mean you Bostar 

I be dead that horrible relation kill i 
I never shall see addition to my heap 
now Hannibal be conquer 

you have store 
enough wealth to maintain another army 
that may bring home increase Pray let we use 
your state we will spare your wisdom 

how be that Hanno 
my state and spare my wisdom I be a senator 
and wear my gown as formal as you 
can nod and spit at the end of every sentence 
and number with my own arithmetic 
more sum of coin then thy whole family 
part with my wealth I will rather die and purchase 
hell with it if Pluto will but sell his kingdom 
yet sure it can be so rich as I be 
the judge there be just bribe can buy 
a partial sentence 

ha methinks they shall 
salute i though I bring not victory 
when I present they with wealth their flattery 
be great than become they be I less 
in merit now then when success attend 
my action glue unto their seat and Hannibal 
enter grave father 

on sir we be patient 
to hear you speak 

but patient he that stand 
accuse may challenge that or just tax you 
of more than tyranny 

be you so confident 
you dare affront your judge 

ha my judge 
what envy though it be still from the black gall 
of lean Erinys adder can so blemish 
my life or same that from the least suspect 
I may incur a sentence be it for this 
I have through blood and sweat make Carthage great 
as Rome herself and have not politic dotage 
infect with your private avarice 
that will not spare i what myself bestow 
upon your case prevent it by call 
i and my army home I have ere this 
make Rome your tributary and be I 
return now to be judge because I have 
after so many victory lose one battle 
the monstrous birth of your ingratitude 
be able to fright manhood from posterity 
and check all undertake 

whence do you 
receive commission to move peace with Scipio 

from my own judgement that foresee the danger 
my power can not prevent 

it seem you be 
declaim to coward 

there be no privilege pull he down 
under your gown for that learn to know man 
then be his judge 

pray heaven he hurt not i 
most valiant Hannibal 

I hate your flattery 
it be mix with scorn and I will rather trample 
upon your purple 

good my lord forbear 
your violence Consider but their person 
and dignity 

shall Jove himself provoke i 
with a disgrace like this I will challenge he 
to meet upon a cloud ram full of thunder 
and dart it at he till with flame I have 
consume the brass supporter of his heaven 
tumble he down with all his petty god 
unto their first mortality 

the custom 
of Carthage government command respect 
unto their difference 

let the respect 
be likewise teach they that belong to i 
and if my labour have maintain their ease 
in which they have both study and establish 
civil formality my rugged life 
do never practise it may well excuse 
a great error who be my accuser 

yourself 

myself myself will be my judge then 
and make the abuse seat honour for a justice 
which your corrupt soul will never suffer 
your power to execute look carthaginian 
and if your reason eye can see the error 
your blind envy lead it to with blush 
guide they to reformation I that take 
a oath at nine year old before the altar 
when it be smoke with the horrid sacrifice 
of immolate man to be Rome enemy 
and perfect what my father have begin 
I that transfer the wealth of Spain to Carthage 
and through the freeze Alps melt my way 
into the fertile plain of Italy 
that wade with my army through the fen 
of gloomy Arnus in who fog I lose 
one of my body comfortable light 
I that overthrow six consul and at canna 
in one sight kill a hundred roman senator 
and thence present Carthage with a prey 
that may outvie a indian treasury 
cram with the choice wealth I that abroad 
while here you bathe in pleasure make my body 
propose against a tempest and endure the rage 
of more prodigious storm then ever fright 
mortal into religion 

yet at Capua 
the fair salapian Omphale can teach 
our carthaginian Hercules to spin 
and mind his distaff else she will not smile 
upon he for his work 

thy malice Hanno 
like to the break some a rock beat back 
upon the angry main fowl thou own bosom 
I be above it and in spite of thou 
or all the battery of thy calumny 
will stand like a colossus to be gaze at 
by all beneath i when the scorn of man 
shall lash thy envy with the whip of satyr 
who vain do attempt to ruin that 
be build for fame 

nay you may keep your seat 
it well become you 

it become you better 
when your grave nod and formal hem strike terror 
through the affright malefactor heart 
who for some slight offence expect his judgement 
no less than banishment or confiscation 
of all his substance which be share among you 
the public use neglect but in vain 
I tax your vice when your soul be sully 
with a ingratitude to i that make 
all other white as innocence compare 
with that black monster Carthage I disclaim thou 
and rather than employ my power again 
to raise thy head above other in thy ruin 
I will hide my own and but for reverence 
I bear the ash of my ancestor 
I will myself plough furrow in thy womb 
and sow my faction only for the increase 
of my own greatness 

pray observe it father 
he do affect the monarchy he will 
alter our government 

you be deceive 
you be weak enough already there be no need 
of a sedition to subvert your state 
can you resist the roman and make peace 
upon your own condition 

you be betray my lord your safety need 
a sudden resolution Scipio enter 
the gate of Carthage 

o inhuman treachery 
but for prevent justice that will fall 
heavy upon you by some other instrument 
it be piety to wash corruption 
from this abuse place with your blood who stain 
will yet infect the pavement and remain 
like blush in the marble to betray 
the guilt you die for when the roman practise 
their tyranny upon you wish in vain 
you have a Hannibal 

your danger will not 
allow your passion vent pray fly my lord 

into some desert to converse with beast 
they have grateful soul Carthage methinks a earthquake 
shall palsy thy old joint and shrink thy head 
into thy shoulder or thy genius wrap thou 
in a perpetual cloud to hide the shame 
of this base act revenge I will court thou through 
the ruin of my own Carthage shall see 
not i from she her greatness grow from i 
all those that love i follow exeunt senator remain 

will we have 
ensnare he better but his faction want 
a head it be strengthless let a crier publish 
the sentence of his banishment that Scipio 
may take it for our act we must comply 
with all occasion that may make our peace 
a useful good no voluntary bondage 
we must receive the roman with a show 
of less fear than the straits of our necessity 
may excuse manhood for 

now carthaginian 
although I be a conqueror success 
swell i no high to prefer myself 
above what judgement warrant I have strive 
with all oppose reason to forget 
your often breach of faith which you be tax with 
by all man for a vice that the air you breathe 
infect you with as if the place nature 
enforce it from necessity but custom 
must be conclude be the most efficient 
to cause that barbarous neglect of piety 
which shall be man sole object I be strengthen 
sufficient against fear since I can easy 
compel you to subjection but prefer 
a mild command before imperious rigour 
declare yourselves and you shall find that we 
practise no cruelty 

most worthy roman 
we may excuse the general and confer 
the guilt upon some private few who lead 
by a ambition make this war without 
consent from we some we have just punish 
and he by who as by the first great mover 
the rest be hurry forward we have banish 
to take from Rome all cause of afterjealousy 
his faction do prevent it else we have 
yield he up to Scipio peace be now 
the thing we crave and the condition 
no strict than the carthaginian 
will have propose have they be conqueror 
and Scipio sue to they 

can there be faith 
in those that will betray their own and such a one 
as make the end of all his action 
your greatness first and when that fail your safety 
a man that more than figure mar and merit 
a deify by your gratitude 
blush at it fame and with thy hundred tongue 
till all be hoarse proclaim it the condition 
propose shall stand if but to punish this 
this monstrous act nature methinks shall throw you 
from her warm bosom with a angry motion 
of all the earth sinew and not suffer you 
to suck her milk but dry her fruitful womb 
into a barrenness before such monster 
shall be again produce as you perform 
the strict clause and what afflict you most 
call it not satisfaction for our injury 
but punishment for your ingratitude 
to Hannibal 

that will take from my suffering 
when those we hate in misery bear a part 
envy grow fat by eat her own heart exeunt 

Lelius attend the carthaginian senator 
survey the city and see execution exit 
of all the league include do Scipio triumph 
and Massanissa hang the head one article 
be that they shall restore to Massanissa 
all that they have deprive he of

I think her memory have be wash away 
with the large stream of blood so late flow 
from his victorious sword Come Massanissa

of her most curious labour and if fortune 
shall in so fair a book blur any lest 
exact draw line her deity be cruel 
your own be a barbarous country where civility

to Lucius court 

and Lucius when grow man

and yet without least pause he give her back

I be all for action music 

Massanissa be

to gratulate your victory and the peace 
that give they rest the soldier have prepare 
a slight solemnity the carthaginian 
mix with the roman though their heavy heart 
to part with so much treasure scarce admit it 

it be seasonable there be cause to joy 
since massanissa new wed to my bosom 
and this young lady nuptial 
on brave on the foe be meet 
the soldier rank the battle set 
make the earth tremble and the sky 
redouble echo from your cry 
blood put a scarlet mantle on 
the late green plain they will sty anon 
then follow but your order keep 
take prisoner set their ransom deep 
retreat for fame and the delight 
that peace bring only soldier fight 
so you proportion pleasure we give way to it 
be Lelius yet inform of Hannibal 

that he be flee unto Antiochus 
or else to Prusias of Bythinia 
his end be doubtful 

if his discontent 
shall anew whet his envy to attempt 
their aid it will much disturb the asian province 
we will follow to prevent it Lelius you 
shall carry our success unto the senate 
and with it Syphax and the Carthage pledge 
Come my soul half we will hunt this Africa lion 
into a strong toil fame shall wait on we 
till we have load she and that she see 
our triumph finish in his tragedy exeunt 

you be welcome though your fortune be ebb the memory 
of what you have be shall command respect 
from good man to you virtue be not lessen 
by want of a success that be but a gloss 
fortune set on she misery do make 
her inside glorious sometime when desertless 
and bastard action as the heir of chance 
shine in their superficies but be search 
be find like bladder swell with a enforcement 
of wind into they which the least necessity 
or adverse fortune prick they dilate 
the include air and shrink into their first 
narrow dimension when true virtue bear 
her owner head above affliction wave 
and steer he into harbour 

you be noble 
and like a king with judgement value i 
my mind be never subject I have know 
so much of both that neither of the pastime 
fortune delight herself with can incline i 
to height above a moderate nor decline i 
below myself prosperity adversity 
both make one even scale and weight be add 
to either show the difference he be not man 
will be deject or exalt every one 
shall temper the condition of his state 
such as the present make it with the fear 
or hope of after change and when he labour 
in the extremity of one or flow 
in the swell height of the other still his mind 
shall be the same chance vary every way 
but virtue course be constant 

you express 
a noble resolution and your soul 
show rich and glorious even through the cloud 
of your misfortune there be a readiness 
and a propense desire in i to aid you 
but circumstance must make it probable 
whether the cause justness may command 
the attendance of success for a attempt 
that be warrant by justice can want 
a prosperous end 

if to descend my country 
or to compel encroach enemy 
to satisfaction such as will deprive we 
of the earth that nature in her legacy 
make our proportion be a justice I 
do never injury for these be only 
the motive to my action fame I know 
can not be silent but she must inform 
even the remote dweller how proud Rome 
who infant greatness by ambition nurse 
be now in grow and will spread itself 
if a prevention stay it not beyond 
all limit of the yet know world insult 
over her neighbour province from Carthage 
she have enforce Sicilia the world granary 
and other hand and her general 
swell with his fortune have attempt far 
to overflow all Africa you may likewise 
expect he will encroach upon your Asia 
Antiochus be already vanquish 
and flee to Ephesus if nothing else 
your safety shall invite you to take arm 
though but defensive state that never know 
a change but in their growth which a long peace 
have bring unto perfection be like steel 
which be neglect will consume itself 
with its own rust So do security 
eat through he heart of state while they be sleep 
and lull in her false quiet Prusias therefore 
shall dwell no long in so great a danger 
if he will not be a soldier let he arm 
his people Hannibal will be their captain 
and lead they unto action that shall take 
Fam with the wonder till I have make Rome 
who like the earth issue heap up hill on hill 
to raise her proud head nothing my right hand 
jovelike be arm with thunder which shall fly 
wing with prodigious flame of just revenge 
to punish her impiety 

I can glad 
cherish your resolution be ground 
on justice but to engage myself or people 
in a uncertain war before provoke 
by enemy be rashness that excuse 
can no way gloss to make it show a act 
worthy a man much less a king 

you value 
those scruple more than a full weight of honour 
heaven give the difference to you but to be 
the figure of that power that will exact 
a just account of a king great action 
than what inferior owe to their creation 
the essential part of your eternity 
depend upon that point and can you more 
express yourself heaven minister then when 
you do the thing agree with it 

Rome comply 
with we for peace the violation 
of a religious oath superior justice 
can but punish else we may be bold 
to call the worship of the god no more 
than the issue of credulity produce 
to fright we with a name that have no power 
but what our fear allow it Rome be yet 
our friend and till she fall from honour we 
must hold her dear 

in that consist your danger 
she be mask in policy and like a statesman 
without religion steer her course by show 
and mere appearance to whatever end 
amoition point she be not then too rash 
make not the greatness which be yet your own 
derivative from she it will leave your name 
a stain in time record and blot the table 
that shall preserve it 

noble Hannibal 
be safe with we and confident I expect 
the roman legate and if mediation 
or any practice which I can with honour 
assay to reconcile you may be useful 

to reconcile we time shall first run back 
to his beginning and the world return 
to its first chaos ere I will admit 
of such a word let those that fawn upon 
the smile of peace and softness to delight 
their wanton appetite practise their low 
effeminate soul in fear and passion 
each thought of i shall be a numerous army 
to lead against Rome in my imagination 
I will fight with she still though I want soldier 

noble resolve 

ha Scipio and Flaminius 
among the roman legate there be some treachery 
inform thyself Himulco his pursue exit 
my course import no good and my sad soul 
labour with a prophetic apprehension 
of something he intend be ready thou 
thou my last refuge 

sudden cloud methinks 
creep over your eye though you be enemy 
peace warrant gentle greeting Shee be embleme 
in dove that have no gall you be here my guest 
and shall partake a courtly entertainment 
worthy such person 

Hannibal I know 
have put of the rough habit which his mind 
be late wrap in and since chance have make he 
the subject of my conquest in the peace 
Rome have allow his country the condition 
be strict keep all past contention 
must lose their memory and after strite 
be stifle in their first birth by prevention 
I must acknowledge my ambition 
bear my thought high than my country good 
or her enlargement only have my fortune 
captive the person of great Hannibal 
my triumph shall outvie all the rich pomp 
that ever make Rome shine 

that person yet 
be free and capable of new design 
to make himself full owner of a glory 
above Scipio conquest it be not thy success 
decline i the least step towards subjection 
of my still high build hope which be strong 
prop with my resolution shall in time 
raise monument of fame unto my action 
let not one chance exalt thou Hannibal 
though Carthage own he not command a world 
great than she or Rome 

but the dimension 
be bound with that strict necessity 
they can be extend flatter not 
those hope with expectation of a change 
to any better than the now condition 
of thy subvert greatness which be ruine 
beyond all reparation thy attempt 
to build it new want material 
be vain far than the Sicilian dog 
bark against the moon 

be not deceive 
with too much confidence the more they be press 
the more palm flourish that that will make Scipio 
look downward lift i up 

how thou be mock 
with selfopinion know I have a soul 
so full instruct it have power to temper 
the difference of my fortune with that mean 
that even the high glory to myself 
be but adversity and a abject state 
no less than be my present greatness man 
from outward accident shall not derive 
the knowledge of himself for so he be make 
the creature of beginning over which 
his virtue may command fortune and chance 
when he by speculation have inform 
his divine part he be perfect and till then 
but a rough matter only capable 
of better form it oft beget my wonder 
that thou a rude barbarian ignorant 
of all art but of war which custom only 
have be join to thy first nature teach thou 
shall know so much of man 

I study man 
better from practice than thou can from book 
thy learning be but opinion my know truth 
subject to no gross error such as can 
be reconcile but by production 
of new and great do thy learned master 
of art with who even arm thou have converse 
before a battle join if fame speak truth 
by their instruction show thou sure way 
to victory than fortune join to valour 
and a full strength of man 

that which consist 
in action only and the event depend 
upon no certain rule demonstrative 
be fate not reason 

fie this strife sound harsh 
come Massanissa you have share your part 
of virtue and of fortune 

least of virtue 
that leave a just cause to support a wrong one 
such be his fall from Carthage 

you be judge 
in your own cause but who will else subscribe 
to such a partial sentence 

pray no more 
my court look like a parliament of soldier 
where war methinks shall be discourse on how 
a battle shall be order or what form 
have most advantage what man have you know 
or history do mention that exceed 
in the degree of merit 

Alexander 
the first best captain 

who the second 

Pyrrhus 

and who the three 

doubtless myself 

what then 
be I that conquer Hannibal 

if I 
have conquer Scipio I have then be first 

do ever pride so swell the infect part 
of a rich soul be not his mind corrupt 
with that disease of virtue I shall covet 
to join i with it in a eternal fellowship 
and only here in outward enmity 
divide our body 

how be satisfy 
be I yet safe 

my observation 
have be I fear too curious for your danger 
if any be intend want all mean 
of opposition but my fear perhaps 
interpret worse than a consideration 
will from the circumstance which yet have show 
of probability 

why what have see 

arm troop guard all the passage by which 
the house be enter 

I be then betray 
can king be treacherous have they mortal part 
subject to that corruption stain with leprosy 
the glorious brow of honour can creation 
be in her different work so negligent 
as not to perfect they she be idle when 
she make king shall be like god less than man 
Prusias and Scipio thus I mock your plot 
be treacherous now you shall have nothing but 
Hannibal earth to work on take the poison 

what be the meaning 
of this 

it be poison sure that he take 

restrain he 

it be too late 

Call our physician 

all help be vain as your conspiracy 
it be no juggle sop to wrap the sense 
in slumber like death Colches never yield 
a juice more baneful I go still prepare 
thus to overcome your malice which discover 
my death bear i above it 

why shall Hannibal 
from the weak warrant of a bare suspicion 
be guilty of such barbarousness by all 
the hope I have of good man love or memory 
among their true value of desert I ever 
restrain my uncertaine thought their liberty 
from be busy about betray Hannibal 
by any practice honour may not father 
and glad call his own 

persuade thy flatterer 
to credit it those that will deify 
the virtue in thy book not of thy mind 
practice have teach i how to read man soul 
do not I know then thy hypocrisy 
plaster the wound credit of thy act 
but if thou heal it there will be a scar 
to show posterity that what thou do 
be full of base corruption 

thou do much 
lessen thyself in thy first fear and now 
by the illgrounded jealousy of my virtue 
will make thy own tax from this paedia 
I have be true moral the institution 
have be my guide in every action 
which I do either as a man or prince 
Cyrus himself to who they be direct 
pursue they not so strict as I have 
breath not thy soul forth then till thou be satisfy 
of my true innocence for if thou die 
in thy suspicion be assure it will 
disturb thy peace hereafter and thy ash 
as the pile hallow they will fright thy ghost 
with shape of the dishonour thou unjust 
will lay on Scipio 

Tell thy philosopher 
the earth have not a centre that the day 
be not illumine by the sun that fire 
be cold than the everfrozen rock 
that bear the northend of the earth axletree 
when they allow these paradox I 
will credit Scipio work on thou brave minister 
of my last victory over myself 
quench thy unnatural flame with my scortcht bowel 
now thou have meet a heat which join to thy 
make all the frame like the bright forge whence Jove 
have his artillery my heart my heart 
quench it Eridanus but it will dry 
thy water up I be wrap in great fire 
than the rash boy thou choke will this be Oeta 
that like the furious theban I may build 
my own pile and the flame as it ascend 
transform itself into a constellation 
or fix in the upper region of the air 
like a perpetual comet to fright Rome 
with his prodigious light methinks a earthquake 
totter the age fabric that so long 
have bear i on it and the divide pole 
embrace to kiss each other a inversion 
of nature order shall attend the fate 
of die Hannibal so Okes eradicate 
by a prodigious whirlwind tear the earth 
through which their large root spread themselves 
no less than the whole world to be my grave 

he be dead with he my glory Scipio act I will have die 
have not another object worthy they 
or his attempt 

fame break thy trumpet now 
deaf thy wide ear and silence all thy tongue 
since he be dead who with his action wont 
to imp new feather to thy break wing 
and make thou fly a pitch above the reach 
of common eye 

lest that my honour suffer 
in the suspicion of betray he 
I will provide a last monument 
and fix his statue on it 

you Massanissa 
I will see establish in your kingdom Carthage 
thy base ingratitude to he who merit 
but just challenge all that thou can own 
shall teach i a prevention solitude 
be the soul best companion at linturnum 
my country Villa I will terminate 
my after life free from man flattery 
and fear of their lean envy he that suffer 
prosperity to swell he above a mean 
like those impression in the air that rise 
from dunghill vapour scatter by the wind 
leave nothing but a empty fame behind
