what death and fortune across the way of love 

why what be love but fortune tennisball 

nay what be you both but subject unto death 
and I command you to forbear this place 
for here the mouth of sad Melpomene 
be whole bend to tragedy discourse 
and what be tragedy but act of death 
here mean the wrathful muse in sea of tear 
and loud lament to tell a dismal tale 
a tale wherein she late have bestow 
the husky humour of her bloody quill 
and now for table take she to her tongue 

why think death love know not the history 
of brave Erastus and his rodian dame 
it be I that make their heart consent to love 
and therefore come I now as fit person 
to serve for chorus to this tragedy 
have not I be they have not die so soon 

have I not be they have not die so soon 

nay then it seem you both do miss the mark 
do not I change long love to sudden hate 
and then rechange their hatred into love 
and then from love deliver they to death 
fortune be chorus love and death be go 

I tell thou fortune and thou wanton love 
I will not down to everlasting night 
till I have moralise this tragedy 
who chief actor be my sable dart 

nor will I up into the brightsome sphere 
from whence I spring till in the chorus place 
I make it know to you and to the world 
what interest love have in tragedy 

nay then though fortune have delight in change 
I will stay my flight and cease to turn my wheel 
till I have show by demonstration 
what interest I have in a tragedy 
tush fortune can do more than love or death 

why stay we then let we give the actor leave 
and as occasion serve make our return 

why when Perseda will thou not assure i 
but shall I like a mastless ship at sea 
go every way and not the way I will 
my love have last from my infancy 
and still increase as I grow myself

to keep the same until my wander eye 
shall find a harbour for my heart to dwell 
Even in thy breast do I elect my rest

and sweet Perseda accept this ring 
to equal it receive my heart to boot

from water pit or fall in the fire

I pray you sir hold your hand

ah treacherous fortune enemy to love

I keep it not and therefore she be lose 
and lose with she be all my happiness 
and loss of happiness be worse than death 
Come therefore gentle death and ease my grief 
cut short what malice fortune misintend 
but stay a while good death and let i live 
time may restore what fortune take from i 
ah no great loss seldom be restore 
what if my chain shall never be restore 
my innocence shall clear my negligence 
ah but my love be ceremonious 
and look for justice at her lover hand 
within force furrow of her cloud brow 
as storm that fall amid a sun shine day 
I read her just desire and my decay 

I long till Brusor be return from Rhodes 
to know how he have bear he against the Christian 
that be assemble there to try their valour 
but more to be well assure by he 
how Rhodes be fence and how I best may lay 
my never fail siege to win that plot 
for by the holy Koran I swear 
I will call my soldier home from Persia 
and let the sophy breath and from the russian broil 
call home my hardy dauntless janissary 
and from the other skirt of Christendom 
call home my bassa and my man of war 
and so beleaguer Rhodes by sea and land 
that key will serve to open all the gate 
through which our passage can find a stop 
till it have prick the heart of Christendom 
which now that paltry island keep from scathe 
say brother Amurath and Haleb say 
what think you of our resolution 

great Soliman heaven only substitute 
and earth commander under Mahomet 
so counsel I as thou thyself have say 

pardon i dread sovereign I hold it not 
good policy to call your force home 
from Persia and Polonia bend they 
upon a paltry isle of small defence 
a common press of base superfluous Turk 
may soon be levy for so slight a task 
ah Soliman who name have shake thy foe 
as wither leaf with autumn throw down 
fog not thy glory with so foul eclipse 
let not thy soldier sound a base retire 
till Persia stoop and thou be conqueror 
what scandal be it to thy mightiness 
after so many valiant bassa slay 
who blood have be manure to their earth 
who bone have make their deep way passable 
to sound a homeward dull and harsh retreat 
without a conquest or a mean revenge 
strive not for Rhodes by let Persia slip 
the one be a lion almost bring to death 
who skin will countervail the hunter toil 
the other be a wasp with threaten sting 
who honey be not worth the take up 

why Haleb do thou not hear our brother swear 
upon the Koran religious 
that he will make a universal camp 
of all his scatter legion and dare thou 
infer a reason why it be not meet 
after his highness swear it shall be so 
be it not thou be my father son 
and strive kindness wrestle not with ire 
I will not hence till I have let thou know 
what it be to thwart a monarch holy oath 

why his highness give i leave to speak my will 
and far from flattery I speak my mind 
and do discharge a faithful subject love 
thou Aristippuslike do flatter he 
not like my brother or a man of worth 
and for his highness vow I cross it not 
but give my censure as his highness bad 
now for thy chastisement know Amurath 
I scorn they as a reckless lion scorn 
the hum of a gnat in summer night 

I take it Haleb thou be friend to Rhodes 

not half so much be I a friend to Rhodes 
as thou be enemy to thy sovereign 

I charge thou say wherein or else by Mahomet 
I will hazard duty in my sovereign presence 

not for thy threat but for myself I say 
it be not meet that one so base as thou 
shall come about the person of a king 

must I give aim to this presumption 

your highness know I speak in duteous love 

your highness know I speak at your command 
and to the purpose far from flattery 

think thou I flatter now I flatter not 

what dismal planet guide this fatal hour 
villain thy brother groan do call for thou 
to wander with they through eternal night 

o Soliman for love thou I die 

no Amurath for murder he thou die 
o Haleb how shall I begin to mourn 
or how shall I begin to shed salt tear 
for who no word nor tear can well suffice 
ah that my rich imperial diadem 
can satisfy thy cruel destiny 
or that a thousand of our turkish soul 
or twenty thousand million of our foe 
can ransom thou from fell death tyranny 
to win thy life will Soliman be poor 
and live in servile bondage all my day 
accurse Amurath that for a worthless cause 
in blood have shorten our sweet Haleb day 
ah what be dear bond than brotherhood 
yet Amurath thou be my brother too 
if wilful folly do not blind my eye 
ay ay and thou as virtuous as Haleb 
and I as dear to thou as unto Haleb 
and thou as near to i as Haleb be 
ah Amurath why be thou so unkind to he 
for utter but a thwart word 
and Haleb why do not thy heart counsel 
bridle the fond intemperance of thy tongue 
nay wretched Solyman why do not thou 
withhold thy hand from heap blood on blood 
may I not better spare one joy then both 
if love of Haleb force i on to wrath 
curse be that wrath that be the way to death 
if justice force i on curse be that justice 
that make the brother butcher of his brother 
come janissary and help i to lament 
and bear my joy on either side of i 
ay late my joy but now my last sorrow 
thus thus let Soliman pass on his way 
bear in either hand his heart decay 

now death and fortune which of all we three 
have in the actor show the great power 
have not I teach Erastus and Perseda 
by mutual token to seal up their love 

ay but those token the ring and carcanet 
be fortune gift love give no gold or jewel 

why what be jewel or what be gold but earth 
a humour knit together by compression 
and by the world bright eye first bring to light 
only to feed man eye with vain delight 
love work be more than of a mortal temper 
I couple mind together by consent 
who give Rhodes princess to the cyprian prince but love 

fortune that first by chance bring they together 
for till by fortune person meet each other 
thou can not teach their eye to wound their heart 

I make those knight of several sect and country 
each one by arm to honour his belove 

nay one alone to honour his belove 
the rest by turn of my tickle wheel 
come short in reach of fair honour mark 
I give Erastus only that day prize 
a sweet renown but mix with bitter sorrow 
for in conclusion of his happiness 
I make he lose the precious carcanet 
whereon depend all his hope and joy 

and more than so for he that find the chain 
even for that chain shall be deprive of life 

beside love have enforce a fool 
the fond bragardo to presume to arm 

ay but thou see how he be overthrow 
by fortune high displeasure 

ay and by death have be surprise 
if fate have give i leave 
but what I miss in he and in the rest 
I do accomplish on Haleb and Amurath 
the worthy brethren of great Soliman 
but wherefore stay we let the sequel prove 
who be great fortune death or love 

as fit the time so now well fit the place 
to cool affection with our word and look 
if in our thought be semblance sympathy 

my word my look my thought be all on thou 
Ferdinando be Lucina only joy 

what pledge thereof 

a oath a hand a kiss 

o holy oath fair hand and sugar kiss 
o never may Fernando lack such bliss 
but say my dear when shall the gate of heaven 
stand all wide open for celestial god 
with gladsome look to gaze at Hymen robe 
when shall the grace or Lucina hand 
with rosy chaplet deck thy golden tress 
and Cupid bring i to thy nuptial bed 
where thou in joy and pleasure must attend 
a blissful war with i thy chief friend 

full fraught with love and burn with desire 
I long have long for light of Hymen light 

then that same day who warm and pleasant sight 
bring in the spring with many gladsome flower 
be our first day of joy and perfect peace 
till when receive this precious carcanet 
in sign that as these link be interlace 
so both our heart be still combine in one

whence spring this sudden change 
be it unkindness at the little praise 
I give Lucina with my gloss style

and from my neck her neck have win the praise 

what be it then if love of this my person 
by favour and by justice of the heaven 
at last have pierce through thy tralucent breast 
and thou misdoubt perhaps that I will prove coy 
o be assure it be far from noble thought 
to tyrannize over a yield foe 
therefore be blithe sweet love abandon fear 
I will forget thy former cruelty 

ah false Erastus full of treachery 

I always tell you that such coward knight 
be faithless swain and worthy no respect 
but tell i sweet love what be his offence 
that I with word and stripe may chastise he 
and bring he bind for thou to tread upon 

now must I find the mean to rid he hence 
go thou forthwith arm thou from top to toe 
and come a hour hence unto my lodging 
then will I tell thou this offence at large 
and thou in my behalf shall work revenge 

I thus shall man of valour be employ 
this be good argument of thy true love 
I go make reckon that Erastus die 
unless forewarn the weaken coward fly 

thou foolish coward fly Erastus live 
the fair shape but foul mind man 
that ever sun see within our hemisphere 
my tongue to tell my woe be all too weak 
I must unclasp i or my heart will break 
but inward care be most pen in with grief 
unclasp therefore yield i no relief 
ah that my moist and cloud compact brain 
can spend my care in shower of weep rain 
but scald sigh like blast of boisterous wind 
hinder my tear from fall on the ground 
and I must die by closure of my wound 
ah false Erastus how have I misdo 
that thou shall quit my love with such a scorn 
here come the Sinon to my simple heart 
I will frame myself to his dissemble art 

desire persuade i on fear pull i back 
tush I will to she innocence be bold 
how fare Perseda my sweet second self 

well now Erastus my heart only joy 
be come to join both heart in union 

and till I come whereas my love do dwell 
my pleasure be but pain my solace woe 

what love mean my Erastus pray thou tell 

matchless Perseda she that give i strength 
to win late conquest from many victor hand 
thy name be conqueror not my chivalry 
thy look do arm i not my coat of steel 
thy beauty do defend i not my force 
thy favour bear i not my light foot steed 
therefore to thou I owe both love and life 
but wherefore make Perseda such a doubt 
as if Erastus can forget himself 
which if I do all vengeance light on i 

ay i how graceless be these wicked man 
I can no long hold my patience 
ah how thy eye can forge allure look 
and feign deep oath to wound poor silly maid 
be there no honest drop in all thy cheek 
to check thy fraudful countenance with a blush 
call thou i love and love another better 
if heaven be just thy tooth will tear thy tongue 
for this thy perjure false disloyalty 
if heaven be just man shall have open breast 
that we therein may read their guileful thought 
if heaven be just that power that force love 
will never couple wolf and lamb together 
yes heaven be just but thou be so corrupt 
that in thou all their influence do change 
as in the spider good thing turn to poison 
ah false Erastus how have I misdo 
that thou shall pawn my true affection pledge 
to she who worth will never equal i 
what be Lucina wealth exceed i 
yet my sufficient to encounter thou 
be she more fair than I that be not my fault 
nor her desert what be beauty but a blast 
soon crop with age or with infirmity 
be she more wise her year be more than i 
whatever she be my love be more than she 
and for her chastity let other judge 
but what talk I of she the fault be thou 
if I be so disgracious in thy eye 
that she must needs enjoy my interest 
why do thou deck she with my ornament 
can nothing serve she but the carcanet 
which as my life I give to thou in charge 
can thou abuse my true simplicity 
who great fault be over love thou 
I will keep no token of thy perjury 
here give she this Perseda now be free 
and all my former love be turn to hate 

ah stay my sweet Perseda hear i speak 

what be thy word but siren guileful song 
that please the ear but seek to spoil the heart 

then view my tear that plead for innocence 

what be thy tear but Circe magic sea 
where none escape wrack but blindfold mariner 

if word and tear displease then view my look 
that plead for mercy at thy rigorous hand 

what be thy look but like the cockatrice 
that seek to wound poor silly passenger 

if word nor tear nor look may win remorse 
what then remain for my perplex heart 
have no interpreter but word or tear or look 

and they be all as false as thou thyself 

hard doom of death before my case be know 
my judge unjust and yet I can blame she 
since love and jealousy mislead she thus 
myself in fault and yet not worthy blame 
because that fortune make the fault not love 
the ground of her unkindness grow because I lose 
the precious carcanet she give to i 
Lucina have it as her word import 
but how she get it heaven know not I 
yet this be some allegement to my sorrow 
that if I can but get the chain again 
I bold then shall let Perseda know 
that she have wrong Erastus and her friend 
ah love and if thou be of heavenly power 
inspire i with some present stratagem 
it must be so Lucina a frank gamester 
and like it be in play she will hazard it 
for if report but blazon she aright 
she be a frank gamester and incline to play ho Piston

false treacher lay down the chain that thou have steal 

he lewd lie that call i treacherous 

that lie my weapon shall put down thy throat 

fly Erastus ere the governor have any news 
who near ally he be and chief delight 

nay gentleman fly you and save yourselves 
lest you partake the hardness of my fortune 
ah fickle and blind guidress of the world 
what pleasure have thou in my misery 
be not enough when I have lose the chain 
thou do bereave i of my dear love 
but now when I shall repossess the same 
to cross i with this hapless accident 
ah if but time and place will give i leave 
great ease it be for i to purge myself 
and to accuse fell fortune love and death 
for all these three conspire my tragedy 
but danger wait upon my word and step 
I dare not stay for if the governor 
surprise i here I die by martial law 
therefore I go but whether shall I go 
if into any stay adjoin Rhodes 
they will betray i to Philippo hand 
for love or gain or flattery 
to Turkey must I go the passage short 
the people warlike and the king renown 
for all heroical and kingly virtue 
ah hard attempt to tempt a foe for aid 
necessity yet say it must be so 
or suffer death for Ferdinando death 
who honour title force i to misdo 
by check his outrageous insolence 
Piston here take this chain and give it to Perseda 
and let she know what have befall i 
when thou have deliver it take ship and follow i 
I will be in Constantinople 
farewell my country dear than my life 
farewell sweet friend dear than country soil 
farewell Perseda dear of they all 
dear to i than all the world beside 

now be I grow into a doubtful agony 
what I be best to do to run away with this chain 
or deliver it and follow my master 
if I deliver it and follow my master I shall have thank 
but they will make i never the fat 
if I run away with it I may live upon credit 
all the while I wear this chain 
or domineer with the money when I have sell it 
hitherto all go well but if I be take 
I marry sir than the case be alter ay and halter to 
of all thing I do not love to preach 
with a halter about my neck 
therefore for this once I will be honest against my will 
Perseda shall have it but before I go I will be so bold 
as to dive into this gentleman pocket for good luck sake 
if he deny i not how say you sir be you content 
a plain case qui tacet consentire videtur 

see where his body lie 

ay ay I see his body all to soon 
what barbarous villain be it that rifle he 
ah Ferdinand the stay of my old age 
and chief remainder of our progeny 
ah love cousin how be thou misdo 
by false Erastus ah not by treachery 
for well thy valour have be often try 
but while I stand and weep and spend the time 
in fruitless plaint the murderer will escape 
without revenge sole salve for such a sore 
say villain wherefore do thou rifle he 

faith sir for pure good will 
see he be go towards heaven 
I think to see if he have a passport to S Nicholas or not 

some sot he seem to be it be pity to hurt he 
sirrah can thou tell who slay this man 

ay sir very well it be my master Erastus 

thy master and whither be he go now 

to fetch the sexton to bury he I think 

it be pity to imprison such a sot 

now it fit my wisdom to counterfeit the fool 

Come hither sirrah thou know i 
for the governor of the city do thou not 

I forsooth sir 

thou be a bondman and will feign be free 

I forsooth sir 

then do but this and I will make thou free 
and rich withal learn where Erastus be 
and bring i word and I will reward thou well 

that I will sir I shall find you at the castle shall I not 

yes 

why I will be here as soon as ever I come again 

but for assurance that he may not escape 
we will lay the port and haven round about 
and let a proclamation straight be make 
that he that can bring forth the murderer 
shall have three thousand ducat for his pain 
myself will see the body bear from hence 
and honour with balm and funeral 

God send fortune to fool 
do you ever see wise man escape as I have do 
I must betray my master ay but when can you tell 
see where Perseda come to save i a labour 
after my most hearty commendation 
this be to let you understand 
that my master be in good health at the send hereof 
you for ever and ever and ever 
in most humble wise Piston 

This make i think that I have be too cruel 
how get he this from of Lucina arm 

faith in a mummery and a pair of false dice 
I be one of the mummer myself simple as I stand here 

I rather think it cost he very dear 

I so it do for it cost Ferdinando his life 

how so 

after we have get the chain in mummery 
and lose our box in counter cambio 
my master wear the chain about his neck 
than Ferdinando meet we on the way 
and revile my master say he steal the chain 
with that they draw and there Ferdinando have the prickado 

and whether flee my poor Erastus then 

to Constantinople whether I must follow he 
but ere he go with many sigh and tear 
he deliver i the chain and bid i give it you 
for perfect argument that he be true 
and you too credulous 

ah stay no more for I can here no more 

and I can sing no more 

my heart have arm my tongue with injury 
to wrong my friend who thought be ever true 
Ah poor Erastus how thy star malign 
thou great commander of the swift wing wind 
and dreadful Neptune bring he back again 
but Aeolus and Neptune let he go 
for here be nothing but revenge and death 
then let he go I will short follow he 
not with slow sail but with love golden wing 
my ship shall be bear with tear and blow with sigh 
so will I soar about the turkish land 
until I meet Erastus my sweet friend 
and then and there fall down amid his arm 
and in his bosom there pour forth my soul 
for satisfaction of my trespass past 

fair love accord unto thy command 
I seek Erastus and will combat he 

I seek he find he bring he to my sight 
for till we meet my heart shall want delight 

my petty fellow where have thou hide thy master 

marry sir in a armourer shop 
where you have not best go to he 

why so I be in honour bind to combat he 

ay sir but he know your fierce condition 
have plant a double cannon in the door 
ready to discharge it upon you when you go by 
I tell you for pure good will 

in knightly courtesy I thank thou 
but hope the coistrel to escape i so 
think he bear cannon shoot can keep i back 
why wherefore serve my targe of proof but for the bullet 
that once put by I rough come upon he 
like to the wing of lightning from above 
I with a martial look astonish he 
then fall he down poor wretch upon his knee 
and all too late repent his surquedry 
then do I take he on my finger point 
and thus I bear he through every street 
to be a laugh stock to all the town 
that do I lay he at my mistress foot 
for she to give he doom of life or death 

ay but hear you sir I be bind 
in pain of my master displeasure 
to have about at cuff afore you and I part 

ha ha ha eagle be challenge by paltry fly 
thy folly give thou privilege begone begone 

no no sir I must have about with you sir that be flat 
that for retain one so virtuous 
lest my master turn i out of service 

why be thou weary of thy life 

no by my faith sir 

then fetch thy weapon and with my single fist 
I will combat thou my body all unarm 

why lend i thou and save i a labour 

I tell thou if Alcides live this day 
he can not wield my weapon 

why will thou stay till I come again 

I upon my honour 

that shall be when I come from Turkey 

be this little desperate fellow go 
doubtless he be a very tall fellow 
and yet it be disgrace to all my chivalry 
to combat one so base 
I will send some crane to combat with the pigmy 
not that I fear but that I scorn to fight 

fortune thou make Fernando find the chain 
but yet by love instruction he be teach 
to make a present of it to his mistress 

but fortune will not let she keep it long 

nay rather love by who suggest power 
Erastus use such dice as be false 
run not by fortune but necessity 

mean time I bring Fernando on the way 
to see and challenge what Lucina lose 

and by that challenge I abridge his life 
and force Erastus into banishment 
part he from his love in spite of love 

but with my golden wing I will follow he 
and give he aid and succour in distress 

and doubt not to but fortune will be there 
and cross he too and sometime flatter he 
and lift he up and throw he down again 

and here and there in ambush death will stand 
to mar what love or fortune take in hand 

how long shall Soliman spend his time 
and waste his day in fruitless obsequy 
add but a trouble to my brother ghost 
perhaps my grief and long continual moan 
which but for i will now have take their rest 
then farewell sorrow and now revenge draw near 
in controversy touch the I will of Rhodes 
my brother die on Rhodes I will he revenge 
now tell i Brusor what be the news at Rhodes 
have the young prince of Cyprus marry 
Cornelia daughter to the governor 

he have my lord with the great pomp 
that ever I see at such a festival 

what great than at our coronation 

inferior to that only 

at tilt who win the honour of the day 

a worthy knight of Rhodes a matchless man 
his name Erastus not twenty year of age 
not tall but well proportion in his limb 
I never see except your excellence 
a man who presence more delight i 
and have he worship Mahomet for Christ 
he may have bear i through out all the world 
so well I love and honour the man 

these praise Brusor touch i to the heart 
and make i wish that I have be at Rhodes 
under the habit of some errant knight 
both to have see and try his valour 

you shall have see he foil and overthrow 
all the knight that there encounter he 

whatever he be even for his virtue sake 
I wish that fortune of our holy war 
will yield he prisoner unto Soliman 
we may ourselves be fame for virtue 
but let he pass and Brusor tell i now 
how do the christian use our knight 

as if that we and they have be on sect 

what think thou of their valour and demeanour 

brave man at arm and friendly out of arm 
courteous in peace in battle dangerous 
kind to their foe and liberal to their friend 
and all in all their deed heroical 

then tell i Brusor how be Rhodes fence 
for either Rhodes shall be brave Soliman 
or cost i more brave soldier 
then all that I will will bear 

their fleet be weak 
their horse I deem they fifty thousand strong 
their footman more well exercise in war 
and as it seem they want no needful victual 

however Rhodes be fence by sea or land 
it either shall be i or bury i 
what be he that thus bold enter in 
his habit argue he a Christian 

I worthy lord a forlorn christian 

tell i man what madness bring thou hither 

thy virtuous fame and my own misery 

what misery speak for though you Christian 
account our turkish race but barbarous 
yet have we ear to hear a just complaint 
and justice to defend the innocent 
and pity to such as be in poverty 
and liberal hand to such as merit bounty 

my gracious sovereign as this knight 
seem by grief tie to silence 
so his desert bind i to speak for he 
this be Erastus the rhodian worthy 
the flower of chivalry and courtesy 

be this the man that thou have so describe 
stand up fair knight that what my heart desire 
my eye may view with pleasure and delight 
this face of thou shall harbour no deceit 
Erastus I will not yet urge to know the cause 
that bring thou hither 
lest with the discourse thou shall afflict thyself 
and cross the fullness of my joyful passion 
but that we be assure 
heaven bring thou hither for our benefit 
know thou that Rhodes nor all that Rhodes contain 
shall win thou from the side of Soliman 
if we but find thou well incline to we 

if any ignoble or dishonourable thought 
shall dare attempt or but creep near my heart 
honour shall force disdain to root it out 
as air breed eagle if they once perceive 
that any of their brood but close their sight 
when they shall gaze against the glorious sun 
they straight way seize upon he with their talent 
that on the earth it may untimely die 
for look but askew at heaven bright eye 

Erastus to make thou well assure 
how well thy speech and present like we 
ask what thou will it shall be grant thou 

then this my gracious lord be all I crave 
that be banish from my native soil 
I may have liberty to live a christian 

I that or any thing thou shall desire 
thou shall be captain of our janissary 
and in our counsel shall thou sit with we 
and be great Soliman adopt friend 

the least of these surpass my best desert 
unless true loyalty may seem desert 

Erastus now thou have obtain thy boon 
deny not Soliman this own request 
a virtuous envy prick i with desire 
to try thy valour say be thou content 

ay if my sovereign say content I yield 

then give we sword and target 
and now Erastus think i thy enemy 
but ever after thy continual friend 
and spare i not for then thou wrong my honour 
nay nay Erastus throw not down thy weapon 
as if thy force do fail it be enough 
that thou have conquer Soliman by strength 
by courtesy let Soliman conquer thou 
and now from arm to counsel sir thou down 
before thy come I vow to conquer Rhodes 
say will thou be our lieutenant there 
and further we in manage of these war 

my gracious sovereign without presumption 
if poor Erastus may once more entreat 
let not great Soliman command 
to who behest I vow obedience 
enforce i sheath my slaughter blade 
in the dear bowel of my countryman 
and be it not that Soliman have swear 
my tear shall plead for pardon to that place 
I speak not this to shrink away for fear 
or hide my head in time of dangerous storm 
employ i else where in thy foreign war 
against the persian or the barbarous moor 
Erastus will be foremost in the battle 

why favour thou thy countryman so much 
by who cruelty thou be exile 

it be not my country but Philippos wrath 
it must be tell for Ferdinando death 
who I in honour cause have reave of life 

nor suffer this or that to trouble thou 
thou shall not need Philippo nor his I will 
nor shall thou war against thy countryman 
I like thy virtue in refuse it 
but that our oath may have his currant course 
Brusor go levy man 
prepare a fleet to assault and conquer Rhodes 
mean time Erastus and I will strive 
by mutual kindness to excel each other 
Brusor be go and see not Soliman 
till thou have bring Rhodes in subjection 
and now Erastus come and follow i 
where thou shall see what pleasure and what sport 
my minion and my eunuch can devise 
to drive away this melancholy mood 

o master see where I be 

say Piston what be the news at Rhodes 

cold and comfortless for you 
will you have they all at once 

I 

why the governor will hang you and he catch you 
Ferdinando be bury your friend commend they to you 
Perseda have the chain and be like to die for sorrow 

i that be the grief that we be part thus 
Come follow i and I will hear the rest 
for now I must attend the emperor 

accurse chain unfortunate Perseda 

accurse chain unfortunate Lucina 
my friend be go and I be desolate 

my friend be go and I be desolate 
return he back fair star or let i die 

return he back fair heaven or let i die 
for what be he but comfort of my life 

for what be he but comfort of my life 
but why be I so careful of the chain 

but why be I so careless of the chain 
have I not lose it my friend have not be slay 

have I not ask it my friend have not depart 
his part be my death

and here my tongue do stay with swell heart grief 

and here my swell heart grief do stay my tongue 

for who weep you

then take one half of i and cease to weep 
or if you glad will enjoy i both 
I will serve the one by day the other by night 
and I will pay you both your sound delight 

ah how unpleasant be mirth to melancholy 

my heart be full I can laugh at folly 

see see Lucina hate i like a toad 
because that when Erastus speak my name 
her love Fernando die at the same 
so dreadful be our name to cowardice 
on the otherside Perseda take it unkind 
that ere he go I bring not bind unto she 
Erastus that faint heart run away 
alas how can I for his man no soon 
inform he that I seek he up and down 
but he be go in twinkle of a eye 
but I will after my delicious love 
for well I wot though she dissemble thus 
and cloak affection with her modesty 
with love of i her thought be over go 
more than be Phillis with her Demophon 

brave prince of Cyprus and our son in law 
now there be little time to stand and talk 
the Turk have pass our galley and be land 
you with some man at arm shall take the tower 
I with the rest will down unto the strain 
if we be beat back we will come to you 
and here in spite of damn Turk we will gain 
a glorious death or famous victory 

about it then 

drum sound a parley to the citizen 

what parley crave the turkish at our hand

monarch and mighty emperor of the world 
from east to west from south to septentrion 
if you resist expect what war afford 
mischief murder blood and extremity 
what will thou yield and try our clemency 
say I or no for we be peremptory 

your lord usurp in all that he possess 
and that great God which we do true worship 
shall strengthen we against your insolence 

now if thou plead for mercy it be too late 
come fellow soldier let we to the breach 
that be make already on the other side 

now Rhodes be yoke and stoop to Soliman 
there lie the governor and there his son 
now let their soul tell sorry tiding to their ancestor 
what million of man oppress with ruin and scathe 
the turkish army do in Christendom 
what say these prisoner will they turn Turk or no 

First julio will die ten thousand death 

and Guelpio rather than deny his Christ 

then stab the slave and send their soul to hell 

I turn I turn o save my life I turn 

for bear to hurt he when we land in Turkey 
he shall be circumcise and have his rite 

think you I turn Turk 
for fear of servile death that be but a sport 
i'faith sir no

that I will follow she though she go to hell 

now for these lady their life privilege 
hang on their beauty they shall be preserve 
to be present to great Soliman 
the great honour fortune can afford 

the most dishonour that can ever befall 

now fortune what have thou do in this late passage 

I place Erastus in the favour 
of Solyman the turkish emperor 

nay that be love for I couch myself 
in poor Erastus eye and with a look 
overspread with tear bewitch Solyman 
beside I sit on valiant Brusor tongue 
to guide the praise of the herodian knight 
then in the lady passion I show my power 
and last love make Basilisco tongue 
to countercheck his heart by turn Turk 
and save his life in spite of death despite 

How chance it then that love and fortune power 
can neither save Philippo nor his son 
nor Guelpio nor signior julio 
nor rescue Rhodes from out the hand of death 

why Brusor victory be fortune gift 

but have I sleep his conquest have be small 

wherefore stay we there be more behind which prove 
that though love wink love not stark blind 

faith master methinks you be unwise 
that you wear not the high sugarloaf hat 
and the gild gown the emperor give you 

peace fool a sable weed fit discontent away be go 

I will go provide your supper 
a shoulder of mutton and never a salad 

I must confess that Solyman be kind 
past all compare and more than my desert 
but what help gay garment when the mind oppress 
what please the eye when the sense be alter 
my heart be over whelm with thousand woe 
and melancholy lead my soul in triumph 
no marvel then if I have little mind 
of rich embroidery or costly ornament 
of honour title or of wealth or gain 
of music viand or of dainty dame 
no no my hope full long ago be lose 
and Rhodes itself be lose or else destroy 
if not destroy yet bind and captivate 
if captivate then force from holy faith 
if force from faith for ever miserable 
for what be misery but want of God 
and God be lose if faith be overthrow 

why how now Erastus always in thy dump 
still in black habit fit funeral 
can my love persuade thou from this mood 
nor all my fair entreat and blandishment 
be thou my friend thy mind will jump with i 
for what be friend but one mind in two body 
perhaps thou doubt my friendship constancy 
then do thou wrong the measure of my love 
which have no measure and shall never end 
come Erastus sit thou down by i 
and I will impart to thou our Brusor news 
news to our honour and to thy content 
the governor be slay that seek thy death 

a worthy man though not Erastus friend 

the prince of Cyprus to be likewise slay 

fair blossom likely to have prove good fruit 

Rhodes be take and all the man be slay 
except some few that turn to Mahomet 

I there it be now all my friend be slay 
and fair Perseda murder or deflower 
ah gracious Solyman now show thy love 
in not deny thy poor suppliant 
suffer i not to stay here in thy presence 
but by myself lament i once for all 
here if I stay I must suppress my tear 
and tear suppress will but increase my sorrow 

go then go spend thy mourning all at once 
that in thy presence Soliman may joy 
for hitherto have I reap little pleasure 
well well Erastus Rhodes may bless thy birth 
for his sake only will I spare they more 
from spoil pillage and oppression 
than Alexander spare warlike Thebes 
for Pindarus or then Augustus 
spare rich Alexandria for Aria sake 

my gracious lord rejoice in happiness 
all Rhodes be yoke and stoop to Solyman 

First thank to heaven and next to Brusor valour 
which I will not guerdon with large promise 
but straight reward thou with a bounteous largesse 
but what two christian virgin have we here 

part of the spoil of Rhodes which be preserve 
to be present to your mightiness 

this present please more than all the rest 
and be their garment turn from black to white 
I shall have deem they Juno goodly swan 
or Venus milk white dove so mild they be 
and so adorn with beauty miracle 
here Brusor this kind turtle shall be thou 
take she and use she at thy pleasure 
but this kind turtle be for Soliman 
that her captivity may turn to bliss 
fair look resemble Phoebus radiant beam 
smooth forehead like the table of high jove 
small pencil eye brow like to glorious rainbow 
quick lamplike eye like heaven two bright orb 
lip of pure coral breathe ambrosia 
cheek where the rose and lily be in combat 
neck white than the snowy apennine 
breast like two overflow fountain 
betwixt which a vale lead to the elysian shade 
where under covert lie the fount of pleasure 
which thought may guess but tongue must not profane 
a sweet creature nature never make 
love never taint Solyman till now 
now fair virgin let i hear thou speak 

what can my tongue utter but grief and death 

the sound be honey but the sense be gall 
the sweeting bless i with a cheerful look 

how can my eye dart forth a pleasant look 
when they be stop with flood of flow tear 

if tongue with grief and eye with tear be fill 
say virgin how do thy heart admit 
the pure affection of great Soliman 

my thought be like pillar of adamant 
too hard to take a new impression 

nay then I see my stoop make her proud 
she be my vassal and I will command 
coy virgin know thou what offence it be 
to thwart the will and pleasure of a king 
why thy life be do if I but say the word 

why that be the period that my heart desire 

and die thou shall unless thou change thy mind 

nay then Perseda grow resolute 
Soliman thought and my resemble 
life paralyse that never can be join 

then kneel thou down 
and army hand receive the stroke of death 
doom to thyself by thy own wilfulness 

strike strike thy word pierce deep than thy blow 

Brusor hide she for her look withhold i 
o Brusor thou have not hide her lip 
for there sit Venus with Cupid on her knee 
and all the grace smile round about she 
so crave pardon that I can strike 

her face be cover over quite my lord 

why so 
o Brusor see thou not her milk white neck 
that alabaster tower 
it will break the edge of my keen scimitar 
and piece fly back will wound myself 

now she be all cover my lord 

why now at last she die 

o Christ receive my soul 

hark Brusor she call on Christ 
I will not send she to he 
her word be music 
the self same music that in ancient day 
bring Alexander from war to banquet 
and make he fall from skirmish to kiss 
no my dear love will not let i kill thou 
though majesty will turn desire to wrath 
there lie my sword humble at thy foot 
and I myself that govern many king 
entreat a pardon for my rash misdeed 

now Soliman wrong his imperial state 
but if thou love i and have hope to win 
grant i one boon that I shall crave of thou 

whatever it be Perseda I grant it thou 

then let i live a christian virgin still 
unless my state shall alter by my will 

my word be past and I recall my passion 
what shall he do with crown and empery 
that can govern private fond affection 
yet give i leave in honest sort to court thou 
to ease though not to cure my malady 
come sit thou down upon my right hand here 
this seat I keepe void for another friend 
go janissary call in your governor 
so shall I joy between two captive friend 
and yet myself be captive to they both 
if friendship yoke be not at liberty 
see where he come my other best belove 

my sweet and best belove 

my sweet and best belove 

for thou my dear Erastus have I live 

and I for thou or else I have not live 

what word in affection do I see 

ah pardon i great Soliman for this be she 
for who I mourn more than for all Rhodes 
and from who absence I derive my sorrow 

and pardon i my lord for this be he 
for who I thwart Soliman entreat 
and for who exile I lament thus 

Even from my childhood have I tender thou 
witness the heaven of my unfeigned love 

by this one accident I well perceive 
that heaven and heavenly power do manage love 
I love they both I know not which the better 
they love each other best what then shall follow 
but that I conquer both by my desert 
and join their hand who heart be knit already 
Erastus and Perseda come you hither 
and both give i your hand 
Erastus none but thou can win Perseda 
Perseda none but thou can win Erastus 
from great Soliman so well I love you both 
and now to turn late promise to good effect 
be thou Erastus governor of Rhodes 
by this thou shall dismiss my garrison 

must he reap that for which I take the toil 
Come envy then and sit in friendship seat 
how can I love he that enjoy my right 

give i a crown to crown the bride withal 
Perseda for my sake wear this crown 
now be she fair than she be before 
this title so augment her beauty as the fire 
that lie with honour hand rack up in ash 
revive again to flame the force be such 
remove the cause and then the effect will die 
they must depart or I shall not be quiet 
Erastus and Perseda marvel not 
that all in haste I wish you to depart 
there be a urgent cause but privy to myself 
command my ship for to waft you over 

my gracious lord when Erastus do forget this favour 
then let he live abandon and forlorn 

nor will Perseda slack even in her prayer 
and still solicit God for Soliman 
who mind have prove so good and gracious 

farewell Erastus Perseda farewell to 
methinks I shall not part with two such friend 
the one so renown for arm and courtesy 
the other so adorn with grace and modesty 
yet of the two Perseda move i most 
I and so move i that I now repent 
that ere I give away my heart desire 
what be it but abuse of fortune gift 
and therefore fortune now will be revenge 
what be it but abuse of love command 
and therefore mighty love will be revenge 
what be it but abuse of heaven that give she i 
and therefore angry heaven will be revenge 
heaven love and fortune all three have decree 
that I shall love she still and lack she still 
like ever thirst wretched Tantalus 
foolish Soliman why do I strive 
to do he kindness and undo myself 
Well govern friend do first regard themselves 

I now occasion serve to stumble he 
that thrust his sickle in my harvest corn 
please your majesty to hear Brusor speak 

to one past cure good counsel come too late 
yet say thy mind 

with secret letter woe she and with gift 

my line and gift will but return my shame 

hear i my lord let i go over to Rhodes 
that I may plead in your affection cause 
one woman may do much to win another 

indeed Lucina be her husband from she 
she happy may be win by thy persuade 
but while he live there be no hope in she 

why live he then to grieve great Soliman 
this only remain that you consider 
in two extreme the least be to be choose 
if so your life depend upon her love 
and that her love depend upon his life 
be it not better that Erastus die 
ten thousand death than Soliman shall perish 

I say thou so why then it shall be so 
but by what mean shall poor Erastus die 

this shall be the mean 
I will fetch he back again 
under colour of great consequence 
no soon shall he land upon our shore 
but witness shall be ready to accuse he 
of treason do against your mightiness 
and then he shall be doom by martial law 

o fine devise Brusor get thou go 
come thou again but let the lady stay 
to win Perseda to my will meanwhile 
will I prepare the judge and witness 
and if this take effect thou shall be viceroy 
and fair Lucina queen of Tripoli 
Brusor be go for till thou come I languish 
and now to ease my trouble thought at last 
I will go sit among my learned eunuch 
and here they play and see my minion dance 
for till that Brusor bring i my desire 
I may assuage but never quench love fire 

since the expugnation of the rhodian I will 
methinks a thousand year be overpast 
more for the lack of my Perseda presence 
then for the loss of Rhodes that paltry I will 
or for my friend that there be murder 
my valour everywhere shall purchase friend 
and where a man live well there be his country 
Alas the Christian be but very shallow 
in give judgement of a man at arm 
a man of my desert and excellence 
the Turk who they account for barbarous 
have forehear of Basilisco worth 
a number under prop i with their shoulder 
and in procession bear i to the church 
as I have be a second Mahomet 
I fear they will adore i for a God 
wise inform they that I be but man 
although in time perhaps I may aspire 
to purchase godhead as do Hercules 
I mean by do wonder in the world 
a midst their church they bind i to a pillar 
and to make trial of my valiancy 
they lop a collop of my tender member 
but think you basilisk squicht for that 
even as a cow for tickle in the horn 
that do they set i on a milk white ass 
compass i with goodly ceremony 
that day methinks I sit in Pompey chair 
and view the Capitol and be Rome great glory 

I will my master have leave 
some other to be his agent here 
faith I be weary of the office already 
what signior Tremomundo 
that ride a pilgrimage to beg cakebread 

o take i not unprovide let i fetch my weapon 

why I mean nothing but a basolus manus 

no do thou not mean to give i the privy stab 

no by my troth sir 

nay if thou have I have not fear thou I 
I tell thou my skin hold out pistol proof 

pistol proof I will try if it will hold out pin prove 

o shoot no more great God I yield to thou 

I see his skin be but pistol proof from the girdle upward 
what sudden agony be that 

why see thou not how Cupid God of love 
not dare look i in the martial face 
come like a coward steal after i 
and with his point dart prick my posterior 

then here my opinion concern that point 
the lady of Rhodes hear that you have lose 
a capitol part of your lady ware 
have make their petition to Cupid 
to plague you above all other 
as one prejudicial to their muliebrity 
now sir Cupid see you already hurt before 
think it a great punishment to hurt you behind 
therefore I will wish you to have a eye to the back door 

sooth thou say I must be fence behind 
I will hang my target there 

indeed that will serve to bear of some blow 
when you run away in a fray 

sirrah sirrah what be thou 
that thus encroach upon my familiarity 
without special admittance 

why do you not know i I be Erastus man 

what be thou that petty pigmy 
that challenge i at Rhode 
who I refuse to combat for his minority 
where be Erastus I owe he chastisement in Perseda quarrel 

do not you know that they be all friend 
and Erastus marry to Perseda 
and Erastus make governor of Rhodes 
and I leave here to be their agent 

o coelum o terra o maria Neptune 
do I turn Turk to follow she so far 

the more shame for you 

and be she link in like with my foe 

that be because you be out of the way 

o wicked Turk for to steal she hence 

o wicked turn coat that will have she stay 

the truth be I will be a Turk no more 

and I fear thou will never prove good christian 

I will after to take revenge 

and I will stay here about my master business 

farewell Constantinople I will to Rhodes 

farewell counterfeit fool 
God send he good ship 
it be noise about that Brusor be send 
to fetch my master back again 
I can be well till I hear the rest of the news 
therefore I will about it straight 

now fortune what have thou do in this latter act 

I bring Perseda to the presence 
of Soliman the turkish emperor 
and give Lucina into Brusor hand 

and first I sting they with consent love 
and make great Soliman sweet beauty thrall 
humble himself at fair Perseda foot 
and make he praise love and captive beauty 
again I make he to recall his passion 
and give Perseda to Erastus hand 
and after make repentance of the deed 

mean time I fill Erastus sail with wind 
and bring he home unto his native land 

and I suborn Brusor with envious rage 
to counsel Soliman to slay his friend 
Brusor be send to fetch he back again 
mark well what follow for the history 
prove i chief actor in this tragedy 

Perseda these day be our day of joy 
what can I more desire than thou to wife 
and that I have or then to govern Rhodes 
and that I do thanks to great Soliman 

and thanks to gracious heaven that so 
bring Soliman from worse to better 
for though I never tell it thou till now 
his heart be purpose once to do thou wrong 

I that be before he know thou to be i 
but now Perseda let we forget old grief 
and let our study whole be employ 
to work each other bliss and heart delight 

our present joy will be so much the great 
whenas we call to mind fore pass grief 
so singe the mariner upon the shore 
when he have pass the dangerous time of storm 
but if my love will have old grief forget 
they shall lie bury in Perseda breast 

welcome lord Brusor 

and Lucina to 

thank lord governor 

and thanks to you madam 

what hasty news bring you so soon to Rhodes 
although to i you never come to soon 

so it be my lord that upon great affair 
importune health and wealth of Soliman

as ever you respect his future love 
or have regard unto his courtesy 
to come yourself in person and visit he 
without inquiry what shall be the cause

and shall the sea turn tide to force i back

Come fellow see when this matter come in question

or that Soliman be not so fond 
or that Perseda have some other love

yet must his blood be spill for my behoof 
such be the force of morrow burn love 

Erastus lord governor of Rhodes 
I arrest you in the king name 

what think lord Brusor of this strange arrest 
have thou entrap i to this treachery 
intend well I wot without the leave 
or licence of my lord great Soliman 

why then appeal to he where thou shall know 
and be assure that I betray thou not 

yes thou and I and all of we betray he 

no no in this case no appeal shall serve 

why then to thou or unto any else 
I here protest by heaven unto you all 
that never be there man more true or just 
or in his deed more loyal and upright 
or more love or more innocent 
than I have be to gracious Soliman 
since first I set my foot on turkish land 

myself will be his witness if I dare 
but bright Perseda beauty stop my tongue 

why sir why face to face express you not 
the treason you reveal to Soliman 

that very day Erastus go from hence 
he send for i into his cabinet 
and for that man that be of my profession 

I never see they I until this day 

his cabin door fast shut he first begin 
to question we of all sort of firework 
wherein when we have full resolve he 
what may be do he spread on the board 
a huge heap of our imperial coin 
all this be you quoth he if you consent 
to leave great Soliman and serve in Rhodes 

why that be treason but onward with the rest 

what have we here my master before the Marshal 

we say not I nor dare we say he nay 
because we be already in his galley 
but seem content to fly with he to Rhodes 
with that he purse the gold and give it we 
the rest I dare not speak it be so bad 

heaven hear you this and drop not vengeance on they 
the other wit the rest and worst will I discourse in brief 
will you consent quoth he to fire the fleet 
that lie hard by we here in Bosphoron 
for be it speak in secret here quoth he 
Rhodes must no long bear the turkish yoke 
we say the task may easy be perform 
but that we lack such drug to mix with powder 
as be not in his galley to be get 
at this he leap for joy swear and promise 
that our reward shall be redouble 
we come aland not mind for to return 
and as our duty and allegiance bind we 
we make all know unto great Soliman 
but ere we can summon he aland 
his ship be past a ken from the shore 
belike he think we have bewray his treason 

that all be true that here you have declare 
both lay your hand upon the Koran 

foul death betide i if I swear not true 

and mischief light on i if I swear false 

mischief and death shall light upon you both 

Erastus thou see what witness have produce against thou 
what answer thou unto their accusation 

that these be Sinon and myself poor Troy 

now it rest I appoint thy death 
wherein thou shall confess I will favour thou 
for that thou be belove of Soliman 
thou shall forthwith be bind unto that post 
and strangle as our turkish order be 

such favour send all Turk I pray God 

I see this train be plot ere I come 
what boot complain where be no remedy 
yet give i leave before my life shall end 
to moan Perseda and accuse my friend 

o unjust Soliman oh wicked time 
where filthy lust must murder honest love 

dispatch for our time limit be past 

Alas how can he but be short who tongue 
be fast tide with gall sorrow 
farewell Perseda no more but that for she 
inconstant Soliman no more but that for he 
unfortunate Erastus no more but that for i 
lo this be all and thus I leave to speak 

marry sir this be a fair warn for i to get i go 

o save his life if it be possible 
I will not lose he for my kingdom worth 
ah poor Erastus be thou dead already 
what bold presumer dare be so resolve 
for to bereave Erastus life from he 
who life to i be dear than my own 
be thou and thou lord Marshal bring they hither 
and at Erastus hand let they receive 
the stroke of death who they have spoil of life 
what be thy hand too weak than i shall help 
to send they down to everlasting night 
to wait upon thou through eternal shade 
thy soul shall not go mourning hence alone 
thus die and thus for thus you murder he 
but soft methinks he be not satisfy 
the breath do murmur soft from his lip 
and bid i kill those bloody witness 
by who treachery Erastus die 
lord Marshall hale they to the tower top 
and throw they headlong down into the valley 
so let their treason with their life have end 

yourself procure we 

be this our hire 

speak not a word lest in my wrathful fury 
I doom you to ten thousand direful torment 
and Brusor see Erastus be inter 
with honour in a kingly sepulchre 
why when lord Marshal great Hector son 
although his age do plead for innocence 
be soon tumble from the fatal tower 
then be those perjure wicked witness 
why now Erastus ghost be satisfy 
ay but yet the wicked judge survive 
by who Erastus be condemn to die 
Brusor as thou love i stab in the martial 
lest he detect we unto the world 
by make know our bloody practise 
and then will thou and I hoist sail to Rhodes 
where thy Lucina and my Perseda live 

I will my lord lord marshal it be his highness pleasure 
that you commend he to Erastus soul 

here end my dear Erastus tragedy 
and now begin my pleasant comedy 
but if Perseda understand these news 
our scene will prove but tragicomical 

fear not my lord Lucina play her part 
and woo apace in Soliman behalf 

then Brusor come and with some few man 
let we sail to Rhodes with all convenient speed 
for till I foul Perseda in my arm 
my trouble ear be deft with love alarm 

now signior Basilisco which like you 
the turkish or our nation best 

that which your ladyship will have i like 

I be deceive but you be circumcise 

Indeed I be a little cut in the purpose 

what mean make you to steal back to Rhodes 

the mighty pinkany brand bear God 
to who I be so long true servitor 
when he espy my weep flood of tear 
for your depart he bid i follow he 
I follow he he with his fire brand 
part the sea and we come over dryshod 

a matter not unlikely but how chance 
your turkish bonnet be not on your head 

because I now be christian again 
and that by natural mean for as 
the old cannon say very pretty 
nihill est tam naturali quod eo modo colligatum est 
and so forth so I become a Turk to follow she 
to follow she be now return a christian 

o lady and mistress weep and lament 
and wring your hand for my master 
be condemn and execute 

be patient sweet Perseda the fool but jest 

ah ho my nightly dream foretell i this 
which foolish woman fond I neglect 
but say what death die my poor Erastus 

nay God be praise his death be reasonable 
he be but strangle 

but strangle ah double death to i 
but say wherefore be he condemn to die 

for nothing but high treason 

what treason or by who be he condemn 

faith two great knight of the post swear upon the 
Koran that he will have fire the Turk fleet 

be Brusor by 

I 

and Soliman 

no but I see where he stand 
to here and see the matter well convey 

accurse Soliman profane Koran 
Lucina come thy husband to this end 
to lead a lamb unto the slaughterhouse 
have thou for this in Soliman behalf 
with cunning word tempt my chastity 
thou shall aby for both your treachery 
it must be so Basilisco do thou love i speak 

i more than I love either life or soul 
what shall I stab the emperor for thy sake 

no but Lucina if thou love i kill she 

the point will mar her skin 

what dare thou not give i the dagger then 
there be a reward for all thy treason past 

yet dare I bear she hence to do thou good 

no let she lie a prey to raven bird 
nor shall her death alone suffice for he 
Rhodes now shall be no long Soliman 
we will fortify our wall and keep the town 
in spite of proud insult Soliman 
I know the lecher hope to have my love 
and first Perseda shall with this hand die 
then yield to he and live in infamy 

I will ruminate death which the poet 
fain to be pale and meager 
have deprive Erastus trunk from breathe vitality 
a brave cavalier but my approve foeman 
let i see where be that Alcides surname Hercules 
the only club man of his time dead 
where be the elder son of Priam 
that Abraham colour trojan dead 
where be the leader of the Myrmidon 
that well knit Achilles dead 
where be that furious Aiax the son of Telamonius 
or that fraudful squire of Ithaca clepe Ulysses dead 
where be tipsy Alexander that great cup conqueror 
or Pompey that brave warrior dead 
I be myself strong but I confess death to be strong 
I be valiant but mortal 
I be a with nature gift 
a giddy goddess that now give and anon take 
I be wise but quiddit will not answer death 
to conclude in a word to be captious virtuous ingenious 
or to be nothing when it please death to be envious 
the great Turk who seat be Constantinople 
have beleaguer Rhodes who chieftain be a woman 
I can take the rule upon i 
but the shrub be safe when the cedar shake 
I love Perseda as one worthy 
but I love Basilisco as one I hold more worthy 
my father son my mother solace my proper self 
faith he can do little that can speak 
and he can do less that can run away 
then sith man life be as a glass and a Philip may crack it 
i be no more and a bullet may pierce it 
therefore I will play lest in sight 

the gate be shut which prove that Rhodes revolt 
and that Perseda be not Soliman 
ah Brusor see where thy Lucina lie 
butcher despiteful without the wall 

unkind Perseda can thou use she so 
and yet we use Perseda little better 

nay gentle Brusor stay thy tear a while 
lest with thy woe thou spoil my comedy 
and all to soon be turn to tragedy 
go Brusor bear she to thy private tent 
where we at leisure will lament her death 
and with our tear be wail her obsequy 
for yet Perseda live for Soliman 
drum sound a parle be it not for she 
I will sack the town ere I will sound a parley 

at who entreaty be this parley sound 

at our entreaty therefore yield the town 

why what be thou that bold bid we yield 

great Soliman lord of all the world 

thou be not lord of all Rhodes be not thou 

it be and shall be maugre who say not 

I that say no will never see it thou 

why what be thou that dare resist my force 

a gentleman and thy mortal enemy 
and one that dare thou to the single combat 

first tell i do Perseda live or no 

she live to see the wrack of Soliman 

then I will combat thou whatever thou be 

and in Erastus name I will combat thou 
and here I promise thou on my Christian faith 
then will I yield Perseda to thy hand 
that if thy strength shall over match my right 
to use as to thy like shall seem best 
but ere I come to enter single fight 
first let my tongue utter my heart despite 
and thus my tale begin thou wicked tyrant 
thou murderer accurse homicide 
for who hell gape and all the ugly fiend 
do wait for to receive thou in their jaw 
ah perjure and in human Soliman 
how can thy heart harbour a wicked thought 
against the spotless life of poor Erastus 
be he not true will thou have be as just 
be he not valiant will thou have be as virtuous 
be he not loyal will thou have be as love 
ah wicked tyrant in that one man death 
thou have betray the flower of Christendom 
die he because his worth obscure thou 
in slaughter he thy virtue be defame 
do thou misdo he in hope to win Perseda 
ah foolish man therein thou be deceive 
for though she live yet will she never live thou 
which to approve I will come to combat thou 

injurious foul mouth knight my wrathful arm 
shall chastise and rebuke these injury 

ay but hear you be you so foolish to fight with he 

I sirrah why not as long as I stand by 

I will not defend Erastus innocence 
but thou maintain of Perseda beauty 

I now I lie Perseda at thy foot 
but with thy hand first wound to the death 
now shall the world report that Soliman 
slay Erastus in hope to win Perseda 
and murder she for love of her husband 

what my Perseda ah what have I do 
yet kiss i gentle love before thou die 

a kiss I grant thou though I hate thou deadly 

I love thou dear and accept thy kiss 
why do thou love Erastus more than i 
or why do not give Soliman a kiss 
ere this unhappy time than have thou live 

ah let i kiss thou too before I die 

nay die thou shall for thy presumption 
for kiss she who I do hold so dear 

I will not kiss her sir but give i leave 
to weep over she for while she live 
she love i dear and I love she 

if thou do love her villain as thou say 
then wait on she through eternal night 
ah Perseda how shall I mourn for thou 
fair spring rose ill pluck before thy time 
ah heaven that hitherto have smile on i 
why do you unkind lower on Soliman 
the loss of half my realm nay crown decay 
can not have prick so near unto my heart 
as do the loss of my Perseda life 
and with her life I likewise lose my love 
and with her love my heart felicity 
even for Erastus death the heaven have plague i 
ah no the heaven do never more accurse i 
then when they make i butcher of my love 
yet just how can I condemn myself 
when Brusor live that be the cause of all 
Come Brusor help to lift her body up 
be she not fair 

Even in the hour of death 

be she not constant 

as firm as be the pole whereon heaven lie 

be she not chaste 

as be Pandora or Diana thought 

then tell i his treason set aside 
what be Erastus in thy opinion 

fair speak wise courteous and liberal 
kind even to his foe gentle and affable 
and all in all his deed heroical 

ah be he so how dare thou then ungracious counsellor 
first cause i murder such a worthy man 
and after tempt so virtuous a woman 
be this therefore the last that ere thou speak 
janissary take he straight unto the block 
off with his head and suffer he not to speak 
and now Perseda here I lay i down 
and on thy beauty still contemplate 
until my eye shall surfeit by my gaze 
but stay let i see what paper be this 
tyrant my lip be see with deadly poison 
to plague thy heart that be so full of poison 
what be I poison then janissary 
let i see Rhodes recover ere I die 
soldier assault the town on every side 
spoil all kill all let none escape your fury 
say captain be Rhodes recover again 

it be my lord and stoop to Soliman 

yet that alley the fury of my pain 
before I die for doubtless die I must 
I fate injurious fate have so decree 
for now I feel the poison begin to work 
and I be weak even to the very death 
yet some thing more content I die 
for that my death be wrought by her devise 
who live be my joy who death my woe 
ah janissary now die your emperor 
before his age have see his mellow year 
and if you ever love your emperor 
affright i not with sorrow and lament 
and when my soul from body shall depart 
trouble i not but let i pass in peace 
and in your silence let your love be show 
my last request for I command no more 
be that my body with Perseda be 
inter where my Erastus lie entomb 
and let one epitaph contain we all 
ah now I feel the paper tell i true 
the poison be disperse through every vain 
and boil like Aetna in my fry gut 
forgive i dear Erastus my unkindness 
I have revenge thy death with many death 
and sweet Perseda fly not Soliman 
whenas my glide ghost shall follow thou 
with eager mood through eternal night 
and now pale death sit on my pant soul 
and with revenge ire do tyrannize 
and say for Soliman too much amiss 
this day shall be the period of my bliss 

I give Erastus woe and misery 
amid his great joy and jollity 

but I that have power in earth and heaven above 
sting they both with never fail love 

but I bereave they both of love and life 

of life but not of love for even in death 
their soul be knit though body be disjoin 
thou do but wound their flesh their mind be free 
their body bury yet they honour i 

hence foolish fortune and thou wanton love 
your deed be trifle i of consequence 

I give world happiness and woe increase 

by join person I increase the world 

by wastning all I conquer all the world 
and now to end our difference at last 
in this last act note but the deed of death 
where be Erastus now but in my triumph 
where be the murderer but in my triumph 
where be judge and witness but in my triumph 
where be false Lucina but in my triumph 
where be fair Perseda but in my triumph 
where be Basilisco but in my triumph 
where be faithful Piston but in my triumph 
where be valiant Brusor but in my triumph 
and where be great Soliman but in my triumph 
their love and fortune end with their life 
and they must wait upon the car of death 
pack love and fortune play in comedy 
for powerful death best fit tragedy 

I go yet love shall never yield to death 

but fortune shall for when I waste the world 
than time and kingdom fortune shall decay 

mean time will fortune govern as she may 

I now will death in his most haughty pride 
fetch his imperial car from deep hell 
and ride in triumph through the wicked world 
spare none but sacred Cynthia friend 
who death do fear before her life begin 
for holy fate have grave it in their table 
that death shall die if he attempt her end 
who life be heaven delight and Cynthia friend
