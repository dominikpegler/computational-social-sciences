what manner of man be this Richard duke of Gloster 

a man ill shape crooked back lame arm withal 
valiant mind but tyrannous in authority 
so during the minority of the young prince 
he be make lord protector over the realm 
gentile suppose that Edward now have reign 
full two and twenty year and now like to die 
have summon all his noble to the court 
to swear allegiance with the duke his brother 
for truth unto his son the tender prince 
who father soul be now near flight to God 
leave behind two son of tender age 
five daughter to comfort the hapless queen 
all under the protection of the duke of Gloster 
thus gentle excuse the length by the matter 
and here begin truth pageant poetry 
wend with i 

long live my sovereign in all happiness 

a honourable age with Croesus wealth 
hourly attend the person of the king 

and welcome you peer of England unto your king 

for our unthankfulness the heaven have throw thou down 

I fear for our ingratitude our angry God do frown 

why noble he that lie i here 
can raise i at his pleasure 
but my dear friend and kinsman 
in what estate I now lie it be see to you all 
and I feel myself near the dreadful stroke of death 
and the cause that I have request you in friendly wise 
to meet together be this 
that where malice and envy sow sedition in the heart of man 
so will I have that admonish and friendly favour 
overcome in the heart of yond lord Marcus and lord Hastings 
both for how I have govern these two and twenty year 
I leave it to your discretion 
the malice have still be a enemy to you both 
that in my life time I can never get any league of amity betwixt you 
yet at my death let i entreat you to embrace each other 
that at my last departure you may send my soul 
to the joy celestial 
for leave behind i my young son 
your lawful king after my decease 
may be by your wise and grave counsel so govern 
which no doubt may bring comfort 
to his famous realm of England 
but what say lord Marcus and lord Hastings 
what not one word nay then I see it will not be 
for they be resolute in their ambition 

ah yield lord Hastings 
and submit yourselves to each other 
and you lord Marcus submit yourself 
see here the age king my father 
how he sue for peace betwixt you both 
consider lord Marcus you be son to my mother the queen 
and therefore let i entreat you to mitigate your wrath 
and in friendly sort embrace each other 

nay cease thy speech Elizabeth 
it be but folly to speak to they 
for they be resolute in their ambitious mind 
therefore Elizabeth I feel myself at the last instant of death 
and now must die be thus torment in mind 

may it be that thou lord Marcus 
that neither by entreaty of the prince 
courteous word of Elizabeth his daughter 
may withdraw thy ambition from i 

may it be that thou lord Hastings 
can not perceive the mark his grace aim at 

no I be resolute except thou submit 

if thou be resolute give up the upshot 
and perhaps thy head may pay for the loss 

ah god sith at my death you jar 
what will you do to the young prince after my decease 
for shame I say depart from my presence and leave i to myself 
for these word strike a second die to my soul 
ah my lord I think I can have command 
a great thing than this at your hand 
but sith I can I take my leave of you both 
and so depart and trouble i no more 

with shame and like your majesty I submit therefore 
crave humble pardon on my knee 
and will rather that my body shall be a prey to my enemy 
rather than I will offend my lord at the hour 
and instance of his death 

ah thanks lord Hastings 

ah yield lord Marcus sith lord Hastings 
be content to be unite 

ah yield lord Marcus thou be too obstinate 

my gracious lord I be content 
and humble crave your grace pardon on my knee 
for my foul offence 
and see my lord my breast open to my adversary 
that he may take revenge then once it shall be say 
I will offend my gracious sovereign 

now let i see you friendly give one another your hand 

with a good will an it like your grace 
therefore lord Marcus take here my hand 
which be once vow and swear to be thy death 
but now through entreaty of my prince 
I knit a league of amity for ever 

well lord Hastings not in show but in deed 
take thou here my hand which be once vow 
to have shiver thy body in piecemeal 
that the fowl of the air shall have feed 
their young withal 
but now upon allegiance to my prince I vow perfect love 
and live friendship for ever 

now for confirm of it here take your oath 

if I lord Hastings falcify my league of friendship 
vow to lord Marcus I crave confusion 

like oath take I and crave confusion 

Even when the great of his torment have leave he 

but be the noble agree to the contentment of the prince 

the noble and peer be agree as the king will wish they 

Lodowick thou revive i 

ay but few thought that the agreement and his life will have end together

for I have have thanks and too much more than I look for 

in faith sir you shall have it 
but you must bear with i a little 
but sir I marvel how you can be so greedy for your money 
when you see sir we be so uncertain of our own 

how so uncertain of my own 
why do thou know anybody will come to rob i 

why no 

will thou come in the night and cut my throat 

no 

will thou and the rest of thy companion

there there huffer but by your leave 
the king death be a maim to her credit 
but they say there be my lord Hastings in the court 
he be as good as the ace of heart at maw 
well even as they brew so let they bake for i 
but I must about the street to see and I can meet 
with such cold customer as they I meet withal even now 
mass if I meet with no better 
I be like to keep a bad household of it 

my friend depart 
the hour command your absence 
leave i and every man look to his charge 

renown and right worthy protector 
who excellency far deserve the name of king than protector 
sir William Casbie wish my lord 
that your grace may so govern the young prince 
that the crown of England may flourish in all happiness 

ah young prince and why not I Exit Casbie 
or who shall inherit Plantagines but his son 
and who the king decease but the brother 
shall law bridle nature or authority hinder inheritance 
no I say no principality brook no equality 
much less superiority 
and the title of a king be next under the degree of a God 
for if he be worthy to be call valiant 
that in his life win honour and by his sword win riches 
why now I with renown of a soldier which be never sell but 
by weight nor change but by loss of life 
I reap not the gain but the glory and since it become 
a son to maintain the honour of his decease father 
why shall not I hazard his dignity by my brother son 
to be base than a king I disdain 
and to be more then protector the law deny 
why my father get the crown my brother win the crown 
and I will wear the crown 
or I will make they hop without their crown that deny i 
have I remove such log out of my sight as my brother Clarence 
and king Henry the sixth to suffer a child to shadow i 
nay more my nephew to disinherit i 
yet most of all to be release from the yoke of my brother 
as I term it to become subject to his son 
no death nor hell shall not withhold i but as I rule I will reign 
and so reign that the proud enemy shall not abide 
the sharp shower why what be the babe but a puff of 
gunpowder a mark for the soldier food for fish 
or line for bed device enough to make they away 
wherein I be resolute and determine needs no counsel 
ho who be within 

may it please your majesty 

ha villain majesty 

I speak but upon that which shall be my good lord 

but what be he with thou 

a messenger with a letter from the right honourable 
the duke of Buckingham 

sirrah give place 
ah how this title of majesty animate i to my purpose 
rise man regard no fall haply this letter bring good luck 
may it be or be it possible 
do fortune so much favour my happiness 
that I no soon devise but she set abroach 
or do she but to try i that raise i aloft 
my fall may be the great well laugh on sweet change 
be as be may I will never fear colour nor regard ruth 
valour bring fame and fame conqueres death 
Percival 

my lord 

for so thy letter declare thy name 
thy trust to thy lord be a sufficient warrant 
that I utter my mind full unto thou 
and see thy lord and I have be long foe 
and have find now so fit opportunity to join league 
to allay the proud enemy tell he thus as a friend 
I do accept of his grace and will be as ready to put in practice 
to the uttermost of my power whatever he shall be to devise 
but whereas he have write that the remove of the young 
prince from the queen friend may do well 
tell he thus it be the only way to our purpose 
for he shall short come up to London to his coronation 
at which instant we will be both present 
and where by the help of thy lord I will so play my part 
that I will be more then I be and not much less than I look for 
no nor a hair breadth from that I be 
adjudge thou what it be Percival 

God send it my lord but my lord will i to satisfy you and to tell you by word of mouth that he have in readiness a brave company of man 

what power have he 

a brave band of his own 

what number 

my lord to the number of five hundred footman and horseman aider unto he be my lord chamberlain and my lord Hastings 

'souns dare he trust the lord Hastings 

I my lord as his own life he be secret I warrant you 

well Percival this matter be weighty and must not be slip therefore return this answer to thy lord that tomorrow I will meet he for today I can for now the funeral be past I must set a screen before the fire for fear of suspicion again I be now to strengthen myself by the controversy that be betwixt the kindred of the king decease and the queen that be living the young prince be yet in huckster handle and they not thorough friend now must I so work that that water that drive the mill may drown it I climb Percival I regard more the glory than the gain for the very name of a king redouble a man life with fame when death have do his worst and so commend i to thy lord and take thou this for thy pain 

I thank your grace I humble take my leave 

why so now fortune make i a king fortune give i a kingdom let the world report the duke of Gloster be a king therefore fortune make i king if I be but king for a year nay but half a year nay a month a week three day one day or half a day nay a hour swoon half a hour nay sweet fortune clap but the crown on my head that the vassal may but once say God save king Richard life it be enough sirrah who be there 

my lord 

what hear thou about the court 

joy my lord of your protectorship for the most part 
some murmur but my lord they be of the base sort 

a mighty arm will sway the base sort authority do terrify 
but what other news hear thou 

This my lord they say the young king be come up to his coronation attend on by his two uncle earl Rivers and lord Gray and the rest of the queen kindred 

a perilous bone to ground upon and a rush stiff knit which if I can find a knot I will give one half to the dog and set fire on the other 

it be report my lord but I know not whether it be true or no that the duke of Buckingham be up in the march of Wales with a band of man and as they say he aim at the crown 

tush a shadow without a substance and a fear without a cause but yet if my neighbour house be on fire let i seek to save my own in trust be treason time slip it be ill jest with edge tool or dally with prince matter I will strike whilst the iron be hot and I will trust never a duke of Buckingham no never a duke in the world further than I see he and sirrah so follow i 

I see my lord be full resolve to climb but how he climb I will leave that to your judgement but what his fall will be that be hard to say but I marvel that the duke of Buckingham and he be now become such great friend who have wont to love one another so well as the spider do the fly but this I have note since he have have the charge of protector how many noble man have flee the realm first the lord Marcus son to the queen the earl of Westmoreland and Northumberland be secret flee how this gear will cotton I know not but what do I meddle in such matter that shall meddle with the untie of my lord point faith do even as a great many do beside meddle with prince matter so long till they prove themselves beggar in the end therefore I for fear I shall be take nip with any word I will set a lock on my lip for fear my tongue grow too wide for my mouth 

right love uncle and the rest of this company my mother have write and think it convenient that we dismiss our train for fear the town of Northampton be not able to receive we and again my uncle of Gloster may rather think we come of malice against he and his blood therefore my lord let i hear your opinion for my word and her letter be all one and beside I myself give consent 

then thus may it please your grace I will show my opinion first note the two house of Lancaster and York the league of friendship be yet but green betwixt they and little cause of variance may cause it break and thereby I think it not requisite to discharge the company because of this the duke of Buckingham be up in the march of Wales with a great power and with he be join the protector for what cause I know not therefore my lord I have speak my mind bold but do as your honour shall think good 

why my lord Rivers wherefore be he protector but for the king safety 

ay sir Thomas Vaughan and therefore a traitor because he be protector 

we have the prince in charge therefore we need not care 

we have the prince but they the authority 

why take you not the duke of Buckingham for the king friend 

yes and yet we may misdoubt the duke of Gloster as a foe 

why then my lord Rivers I think it be convenient that we leave you here behind we at Northampton for conference with they and if you hear their pretence be good towards the king you may in god name make return and come with they but if not leave they and come to we with speed for my sister the queen have will that we shall dismiss our company and the king himself have agree to it therefore we must needs obey 

if it please your grace I be content and humble take my leave of you all 

farewell good uncle ah god if I do live my father year as God forbid but I may I will so root out this malice and envy sow among the nobility that I will make they weary that be the first beginner of these mischief 

worthy well speak of your princely majesty 
which no doubt show a kinglike resolution 

a toward young prince and no doubt forward to all virtue who reign God long prosper among we 

but come uncle let we forward of our journey towards London 

we will attend upon your majesty 

Come on my host what do thou understand my tale or no 

i'faith my guest you have amaze i already and to hear it again it will mad i altogether but because I may think upon it the better I pray you let i hear it once more 

why then thus I serve the right honourable the lord protector 

ay I know that too well 

then this be his grace pleasure that this night he will be lodge in thy house thy fare must be sumptuous thy lodging clean his man use friendly and with great courtesy and that he may have his lodging prepare as near lord Rivers as possible may be 

why sir if this be all this be do already 

nay more 

nay sir and you love i no more here be too much already 

nay my lord grace pleasure be further that when all thy guest have take their chamber that thou convey into my lord hand the key of every several chamber and what my lord pleasure be further thou shall know in the morning 

how lock in my guest like prisoner why do you hear my guest methinks there shall be little better than treason in these word you have utter 

treason villain how dare thou have a thought of treason against my lord therefore you be best be brief and tell i whether you will do it or no 

alas what shall I do who be I best to offend shall I betray that good old earl that have lie at my house this forty year why and I do he will hang i nay then on the other side if I shall not do as my lord protector command he will chop off my head but be there no remedy 

Come sir be brief there be no remedy therefore be brief and tell i straight 

why then sir here be my hand tell my lord protector he shall have it I will do as he command i but even against my will God be my witness 

why then farewell my host 

farewell even the worst guest that ever come to my house Ah master master what a troublesome vocation be I creep into you think we that be innkeeper get all the world but I think I shall get a fair halter to my neck but I must go see all thing do to my great grief 
ho my host chamberlain where be my key 
what pen up like a prisoner but stay I fear I be betray 
the sudden sight of Gloucester duke do make i sore afraid 
I will speak to he and gentle he salute 
though in my heart I envy much the man 
God morrow my lord protector to your grace 
and duke of Buckingham God morrow too 
thank noble duke for our good cheer and for your company 

thou wretched earl who age head imagine nought 
but treachery 
like judas thou admit be to sup with we last night 
but heaven prevent thou our ill and leave thou in this plight 
grieve thou that I the Gloster duke shall as protector sway 
and be you he be leave behind to make we both away 
will thou be ringleader to wrong and must you guide the realm 
nay over board all such mate I hurl while I do guide the helm 
I will weed you out by one and one I will burn you up like chaff 
I will rend your stock up by the root that yet in triumph laugh 

alas good duke for aught I know I never do offend 
except unto my prince unloyal I have be 
then show just cause why you exclaim so rash in this sort 
so false thus i to condemn upon some false report 
but be I here as prisoner keep imprison here by you 
then know I be as true to my prince as the proud in thy crew 

a brave speak good old earl who though his limb be numb 
he have his tongue as much at use as though his year be young 

speak thou the truth how dare thou speak for justice to appeal 
whenas thy pack with thy prince thy falsehood do reveal 
Ah Rivers blush for shame to speak like traitor as thou be 

upbraid you i as traitor to your grace 
no although a prisoner I return defiance in thy face 
the chronicle I record talk of my fidelity and of my progeny 
where as in a glass thou may behold thy ancestor and their treachery 
the war in France irish conflict and Scotland know my trust 
when thou have keep thy skin unscarred and let thy armour rust 
how thou unjust here exclaim 
yea far from love or kin 
be this the oath which at our prince death 
with we thou do combine 
but time permit now to tell thou all my mind 
for well it be know that but for fear you never will have incline 
let commons now have it in hand the matter be begin 
of who I fear the lesser sort upon thy part will run 
my lord I can breathe it out in word like to you but this 
my honour I will set to sale let any common man come in 
and say earl Rivers faith unto his prince do quail 
then will I lose my land and life but if none so can do 
than thou protector injure i and thy copartner too 
but since as judge here you be and take no remorse 
spare i not let i have law injustice do your worst 

my lord lay down a cool card this game be go too far 
you have he fast now cut he off for fear of civil war 
injurious earl I hardly brook this portion thou have give 
thus with my honour i to touch but thy ruth shall begin 

but as thou be I leave thou here 
unto the officer custody 
first bear he to Pomfret castle 
charge they to keep he secret 
and as you hear from i so deal 
let it be do immediate 
take from our garrison one whole band 
to guard he thither safe 

and send thou i to common jail 
nay then I know thy mind 
God bless these young and tender babe 
that I do leave behind 
and God above protect they day and night 
those be the mark thou aim at to rid they from their right 
farewell sweet England and my country man 
earl Rivers lead the way 
yet will my life may rid you from this thrall 
but for my stock and kindred to the queen I great fear they all 
and thus disloyal duke farewell whenever this be know 
the shame and infamy thereof be sure will be thy own 

so now my lord of Buckingham let we hoist up sail while the wind serve this hot beginning must have a quick dispatch therefore I charge and command straight that every highway be lay close that none may be suffer to carry this news before we ourselves come for if word come before we then be our pretence bewray and all we have do to no effect if any ask the cause why they may not pass use my authority and if he resist shoot he through now my lord of Buckingham let we take posthorse to stony Stratford where happy I will say such grace to the prince dinner that I will make the devout of they forget what meat they eat and yet all for the best I hope 

lord Gray you do discomfort the king by reason of your heaviness 

alas sir Richard how can I be merry when we have so great a charge of his grace and again this make i to grieve the more because we can hear from earl Rivers which make i think the protector and he have be at some word 

why good uncle comfort yourself no doubt my uncle earl Rivers be well and be come no doubt with my uncle of Gloster to meet we else we shall have hear to the contrary if any have cause to fear it be myself therefore good uncle comfort yourself and be not sad 

the sweet juice of such a grape will comfort a man be he half dead and the sweet word of such a prince will make man careless of mishap how dangerous soever 

lord Gray we hear now by all likelihood the protector not to be far therefore we be to entertain he and the duke of Buckingham with courtesy both for the prince behalf and for our own 

sir Richard Hapc I shall hardly show the protector or the duke of Buckingham any merry countenance consider how hardly I have be use by they both but yet for love to my prince I will bridle my affection but in good time they come 

long live my princely nephew in all happiness 

thank uncle of Gloster for your courtesy yet you have make haste for we look not for you as yet 

therein I show my humble duty to your grace who life I wish to redouble your decease father day 

thank good uncle 

long live my gracious prince 

thank Buckingham but uncle you will bear we company towards London 

for that cause we come 

gentleman on afore keep your room how now lord Gray do you justle in the presence of the king this be more than needs 

my lord I scarce touch you I hope it be no offence 

sir no great offence but inward envy will burst out no lord Gray you can hide your malice to we of the king blood 

why good uncle let i know the cause of your sudden quarrel 

marry thus noble nephew the old wound of envy be rub by lord Gray venomous rashness be grow to such a venomous sore that it be incurable without remove of dead flesh 

lord Gray I do so much dislike thy abuse that be it not in presence of the prince I will bid thou combat but thus and it shall like your grace I arrest and attach this lord Gray sir Thomas Vaughon and Richard Hapce of high treason to your grace and that lord Gray have convey money out of the tower to relieve our enemy the Scot and now by curry favour with your majesty he think it to be hide 

only this I add you govern the prince without my authority allow i no more than the bare name of protector which I will have in the despite of you and therefore as your competitor earl Rivers be already imprison so shall you be till time afford the law to take place 

but whereas we be attach as traitor to his grace and govern he without your authority why we have authority from the mother queen and for the delivery of the money to the Scot it be do by a general consent of you all and that I have your hand to show for my discharge therefore your arrest and attachment be not lawful and yet as lawful as your quarrel be right 

thy presumption condemn thou lord Gray thy arrest be lawful therefore see they speedy and secret imprison and after the coronation they shall answer it by law meanwhile officer look to your charge 

Ah god and be it justice without my consent be I a king and bear no authority my love kindred commit to prison as traitor in my presence and I stand to give aim at they Ah Edward will thou lie by thy father side or else he have live till thou have be better able to rule if my near kindred be commit to prison what remain for i a crown Ah but how so beset with sorrow that the care and grief will kill i ere I shall enjoy my kingdom well since I can command I will entreat good uncle of Gloster for all I can say little but for my uncle lord Gray what need he be a thief or convey money out of the tower when he have sufficient of his own but good uncle let i bail they all if not I will bail my uncle lord Gray if I may 

your grace undertake you know not what the matter be perilous especial against the lord Gray 

what perilous matter consider he be a friend to we 

he may be a friend to win favour and so climb to promotion in respect of his equal his equal nay his better 

I know my uncle will conceal no treason or dangerous heresy from we 

yes secret that be too subtle for babe alas my lord you be a child and they use you as a child but they consult and conclude of such matter as be we not careful will prove prejudicial to your majesty person therefore let not your grace fear any thing by our determination for as my authority be only under your grace so shall my loyalty deserve hereafter the just recompense of a true subject therefore I have charge from my brother your father and our late decease king during the minority of your grace I will use my authority as I see good 

ay i unhappy king 

nay let not your grace be dismay for our imprisonment but I will we can warrant your grace from harm and so we humble take our leaf of your grace hope that ere long we shall answer by law to the shame and disgrace of you all 

go you shall answer it by law 

but come uncle shall we to Lon to our untimely coronation

my lord of Oxford you as our second self 
shall hall have the happy lead of the rear 
a place I know which you will well deserve 
and captain blunt Peter Landoyse and you 
shall by in quarter as our battle scout 
provide thus your bowman captain blunt 
must scatter here and there to gall their horse 
as also when that our promise friend do come 
then must you hold hard skirmish with our foe 
till I by cast of a counter march 
have join our power with those that come to we 
then cast close as wing on either side 
we will give a new bravado on the foe 
therefore let we towards Aderstoe amain 
where we this night godwilling will encamp 
from thence towards Lichfield we will march next day 
and near London bid king Richard play 

where shall I find a place to sigh my fill 
and wail the grief of our sore trouble king 
for now he have obtain the diadem 
but with such great discomfort to his mind 
that he have better live a private man his look be ghastly 
hideous to behold and from the privy sentire of his heart 
there come such deep fetch sigh and fearful cry 
that be with he in his chamber oft 
he move i weep and sigh for company 
for if he hear one stir he rise up 
and clap his hand upon his dagger straight 
ready to stab he whatsoever he be 
but he must think this be the just revenge 
the heaven have pour upon he for his sin 
those peer which he unkind murder 
do cry for justice at the hand of God 
and he in justice send continual fear 
for to affright he both at bed and board 
but stay what noise be this who have we here 

why to earl Richmond camp to serve with he 
for we have leave to serve king Richard now 

why come there any more 

a number more 

why these be the villain my lord will have put his life into their hand 
Ah Richard now do my eye witness that thy end be at hand for thy commons make no more account of thou then of a private man yet will I as duty bind give thou advertisement of their unjust proceed my master have lift out many and yet have leave one to lift he out of all not only of his crown but also of his life but I will in to tell my lord of what be happen 

good my lord depart and leave i to myself 

I pray my lord let i go along with you 

my lord it may not be for I have promise my father that none shall come but myself therefore good my lord depart 

good my lord have a care of yourself I like not these night walk and scout abroad in the evening so disguise for you must not now that you be in the usurpers dominion and you be the only mark he aim at and your last night absence breed such amazement in our soldier that they like man want the power to follow arm be on a sudden more like to fly than to fight therefore good my lord if I may not stand near let i stand aloof off 

content thou good Oxford and though I confess myself bind to thou for thy especial care yet at this time I pray thou hold i excuse but farewell my lord here come my lord and father 

captain I pray thou bring i word when thou do descry the enemy and so farewell and leave i for a while 

how fare my gracious lord and father 

in good health my son and the better to see thou thus forward in this laudable enterprise but omit vain circumstance and to come brief to the purpose I be now in few word to deliver much matter for know this when I come to crave leave of the king to depart from the court the king very furious begin to charge i that I be both acquaint with thy practise and drift and that I know of thy land and by no mean will grant i leave to go till as pledge of my loyalty and true deal with the king I shall leave my young son George Standley thus have I leave my son in the hand of a tyrant only of purpose to come and speak with thou 

but omit this I pray tell i shall I look for your help in the battle 

son I can for as I will not go to the usurper no more I will not come to thou 

why then it be bootless for we to stay for all we presume upon be on your aid 

why son George Stanley death will do you no pleasure 

why the time be too troublesome for he to tend to follow execution 

o son tyrant expect no time and George Standley be young and a Grissel be the more easy to be make away 

this news go to my heart but it be in vain for i to look for victory when with a molehill we shall encounter with a mountain 

why son see how contrary you be for I assure you the chief of his company be like to fly to thou than to fight against thou and for i think i not so simple but that I can at my pleasure fly to thou or be with they fight so faint that the battle shall be win on thy part with small encounter and note this beside that the king be now come to Leicester and mean tomorrow to bid thou battle in Bosworth 

Come my lord I do descry the enemy 

why then son farewell I can stay no long
