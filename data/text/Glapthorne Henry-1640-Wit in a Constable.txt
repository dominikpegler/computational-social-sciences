the paper and the parchment it be contain in 
savour of much mortality

to grace a lord mayor festival with show 
allude to his trade or to the company 
of which he be free these be the best preferment 
that can attend your learning

this gentleman be my comely spouse that must be 
it be fit cousin Clare ere it be a bargain 
they know on what condition they do cast 
themselves away upon we 

it be discreet 
think on I will do nothing rash 

mark then 
you man that will transform yourselves to 
monster wretch that will become so miserable 
you will hang yourselves and think it a fair rid dance 
mark what you will come to if you be so mad 
so desperate mad to wed we you must first 
resolve like patient gull to have your nose 
twinge if we chance to itch your ear like ass 
when they grow lazy crop lest they overhear 
our chamber secret for our recreation 
and lest with too much ease we shall grow resty 
we will beat you daily while you like tame spaniel 
shall fawn and lick our shoestring 

nor expect 
to get a good word from we in a twelvemonth 
hourly revile and perpetual noise 
shall be as favour take that we will 
vouchsafe to spend in such regardless trifle 
we will be as proud as ere our mother be 
when she be lady majoress and you humble 
as her trim henchboy whatsoever servant 
you keep before although they be your grandsire 
you shall turn off and limmit your attendant 
as it be the city fashion to a woman 
butler that shall not dare without our licence 
to let you have a penny pot of sack 
to give a frugal entertainment to 
your visit friend 

if you have a brother 
kinsman or friend that do in pity grieve at 
the tyranny you live in he it shall be felony 
to converse with we in tissue and plush will 
brave it while you walk in fustian we will 
when we please have our fair coach and horse 
to carry we up to London to ask counsel of 
our mother and our gossip how to abuse you 
you shall be still obedient we command 
and if a lord or courtly gentleman 
who we style servant out of love sometime 
give we a visit you shall not repine 
if we forsake your bed to go to he 

and if you chance as fool will oft be 
peep to spy we couple with respective silence 
you shall depart not dare to bedew 
your eye with tear for grief that you be cuckold 
nor to exalt your honour above your neighbour 
but big with joy triumph that you have wife 
that be in so much credit as to have 
person of quality take the pain to get your 
heir to your large revenue 

very right 
it be not the fashion now adays for knight 
to get their own son it be sufficient for we 
if we can leave they land no matter who 
be their true father 

say sir Timothy 
if upon these condition you can like 
the match be perfect but faith take my counsel 
make not yourselves mere rascal the reproach 
to boy and scholar subject fit for ballad 
not worthy m Ps name to they good sir Timothy 
have pity on yourself and marry rather 
in your own tribe some damsel that can churn 
make cheese and apple pie with currant in they 
and mr holdfast it be far better for you to 
match with some grave doctor imp at Cambridge 
or else as it be your use when you be a student 
lie with your bed maker 

very right 
yet I do know all this be but in jest 
to make we love you better 

true sir Timothy 
speak as it be to let we understand 
by a irony as we the learned call it 
how well they mean to use we therefore in 
my judgement it be requisite with all speed 
while there in this good humour 
to strike the match up 

very right we be 
no jackdaw to be fright with these scarecrow 
mistress your hand and if you will have i so 
if not so likewise but you will repent it 
you will scarce meet two that will offer fair 
than we have do 

but do you mean performance 
true of these condition 

as sincere 
as ere we mean to eat 

or drink good ale 
at mother huff amornings 

you will confess this 
before the priest and witness 

before 
the congregation or at a commencement 
before the university 

that you will be 
honest content cuckold bear your head 
as peaceable and with as much obedience 
as the tame beast in the city 

on my knighthood 

on my gentility 

why then strike hand on it 
since you will needs undo yourselves it be folly 
to endeavour to redeem you but this night 
we will be marry and in private 
not you nor our friend be acquaint with it 
we will meet you anywhere procure the licence 
and we will be ready so farewell tonight
