here in your lewd city the harlot do avoid we son of the sword worse than a severe officer beside here man of the shop can gorge their musty maw with the delicious capon and fat limb of mutton large enough to be hold shoulder of the ram anco●ge the 1● sign while for pure want your soldier oft dine at the charge of the dead among tomb in the great mosque 

it be believe coz and by the wise few too that in the camp you do not feed on pleasant poult a salad and without oil or vinegar appease sometime your gut although they keep more noise than a large pool full of engender frog then for accoutrement you wear the buff as you believe it heresy to change for linen sure most of you be spend in lint to make long tent for your green wound after a onslaught

I will know the cause he shall deny i hardly else 

his melancholy know whence it rise once it may much conduce to help our purpose

yes yes you shall flourish in fresh habiliment but you must promise i not to engage your corporal oath you will see it satisfy at the next press out of the profit that arise from ransom of those rich yeoman heir that dare not look the fierce foe in the face

my gracious brother make we not such a strange to your thought to consume all your honour in close retirement perhaps since you from Spain return a victor with the world conqueror Alexander you grieve nature ordain no other earth to vanquish if it be so princely brother we will bear part in your heroic melancholy 

gentle youth press i no far I still hold my temper free and unshake only some fond thought of trivial moment call my faculty to private meditation 

howsoever your highness do please to term they it be mere melancholy which next to sin be the great malady that can oppress man soul 

they say right and that your grace may see what a mere madness a very midsummer frenzy it be to be melancholy for any man that want no money I with your pardon will discuss unto you all sort all size person and condition that be infect with it and the reason why it in each arise 

learned Selinthus let we taste of thy philosophy 

pish it be unwelcome to any of judgement this fond prate I marvel that our emperor do permit fool to abound in the court 

what make your grave lordship in it I do beseech you but sir mark i the kernel of the text enucleate I shall confute refute repel refel explode exterminate expunge extinguish like a rush candle this same heresy that be shoot up like a pernicious mushroom to poison true humanity 

you shall stay and hear a lecture read on your disease you shall as I love virtue 

First the cause then from whence this flatus Hypocondriacus this glimmer of the gizzard for in wild fowl it be term so by Hypocrates arise be as Averro and Avicen with Abenbucar Baruch and Abofii and all the arabic writer have affirm a mere defect that be as we interpret a want of 

of what Selinthus 

of wit and please your highness that be the cause in general for particular and special cause they be all derive from several want yet they must be consider ponder perpend or premeditate 

my lord you have best be brief your patient will be weary else 

I can play the fool right I mean the physician without I have licence to explicate on the disease but my good lord more brief I shall declare to you like a man of wisdom and no physician who deal all in simples why man be melancholy first for your courtier 

it concern we all to be attentive sir 

your sage and serious courtier who do walk with a state face as he have dress himself in the emperor glass and have his beard turn up by the iron royal he will be as pensive as stallion after catum when he want suit beg suit I mean methinks my lord you be grow something solemn on the sudden since your monopoly and patent which make your purse swell like a wet sponge have be reduce to the last gasp troth it be far better to confess here then in a worse place be it not so indeed 

whatever he do by i I be sure he have hit the cause from whence your grief spring lord Simanthes 

no egyptian soothsayer have true inspiration than your small courtier from cause and want manifold as when the emperor countenance with propitious noise do not cry chink in pocket no repute be with mercer nor with tailor nay sometime too the humour be pregnant in he when repulse be give he by a beauty I can speak this though from no memphian priest or sage caldean from the best mistress gentleman a experience last night I have a mind to a comely sempstress who do refuse i and behold ere since how like a ass I look 

what at your counsel lord the great Almanzor require your presence Mura have decree the war for Persia you my gracious lord prince Abilqualit be appoint chief and you brave spirit Abrahen a assistant to your victorious brother you lord Mura destine lieutenant general 

and must I march against the foe without thy company I relish not the employment 

Alas my lord Tarifa head be grow white beneath his helmet and your good father think it charity to spare my age from travel though this ease will be more irksome to i then the toil of war in a sharp winter 

it arrive just to our wish my gracious brother I anon shall wait on you mean time valiant Mura let we attend my father 

good Selinthus vouchsafe a while your absence I shall have employment short for your trust 

your grace shall have as much power to command Selinthus as his best fancy mistress I be your creature 

now my lord I hope you be clothe with all those resolution that usher glorious mind to brave achievement the happy genius on your youth attendant declare it build for victory and triumph and the proud persian monarchy the sole emulous opposer of the arabic greatness court like a fair bride your imperial arm wait to invest you sovereign of her beauty why be you dull my lord your cheerful look shall with a prosperous augury presage a certain victory when you droop already as if the foe have ravish from your crest the noble palm for shame sir be more sprightly your sad appearance shall they thus behold you will half unsoul your army 

it be no matter such look best suit my fortune know Tarifa I be undisposed to manage this great voyage and must not undertake it 

must not sir be it possible a lovesick youth who hope be fix on marriage on his bridal night shall in soft slumber languish that your arm shall rust in ease now when you hear the charge and see before you the triumphant prize destine to adorn your valour you shall rather be furnish with a power above these passion and be invoke by the mighty charm of honour fly to achieve this war not undertake it I will rather you have say Tarifa lie then utter such a sound harsh and unwelcome 

I know thou love i true and dare I to any bear of woman speak my intention the fatal cause which do withdraw my courage from this employment which like health I covet thou shall enjoy it full but Tarifa the say discovery of it be not fit for i to utter much less for thy virtue to be acquaint with 

why my lord my loyalty can merit no suspicion from you of falsehood whatsoever the cause be or good or wicked it meet a trusty silence and my best care and honest counsel shall endeavour to reclaim or to assist you if it be good if ill from your bad purpose 

why that I know Tarifa it be the love thou bear to honour render thou unapt to be partaker of those resolution that by compulsion keep i from this voyage for they with such inevitable sweetness invade my sense that though in their performance my fame and virtue even to death do languish I must attempt and bring they unto act or perish in the pursuance 

heaven avert a mischief so prodigious though I will not with oversaucy boldness press your counsel yet pardon sir my loyalty which timorous of your love welfare must entreat beseech you with ardent love and reverence to disclose the hide cause that can estrange your courage from its own mar withhold you from this action so much ally to honour pray reveal it by all your hope of what you hold most precious I do implore it for my faith in breed your youth in war great rudiment relieve Tarifa fear that wander into strange unwelcome doubt leave some ambitious frenzy against your imperial father dignity have late seduce your goodness 

no Tarifa I never dare aim at that unholy height in viperous wickedness a sinless harmless if it can be true term one it be my soul labour even to despair with to feign will out do not my blush interdict my language it be unchaste love Tarifa nay take it all and when thou have it pity my misfortune to fair Caropia the chaste virtuous wife to surly Mura 

what a fool desire be with giant strength it make we court the knowledge of hide mystery which once reveal far more inconstant than the air it fleet into new wish that the covet secret have sleep still in oblivion 

I be certain it will fright thy innocence and look to be besiege with strong dissuasion from my purpose but be assure that I have tire my thought with all the rule that teach man moral goodness so to reclaim they from this lovesick looseness but they like wholesome medicine misapply face their best operation fond and fruitless though I as well may hope to kiss the sunbeam because they shine on i as from she to gain one glance of comfort yet my mind that pity itself with constant tenderness must needs revolve the cause of its calamity and melt in the pleasure of so sweet a sadness 

then you be undo for ever sir undo beyond the help of council or repentance it be most ignoble that a mind unshake by fear shall by a vain desire be break or that those power no labour ever can vanquish shall be overcome and thrall by sordid pleasure pray sir consider that in glorious war which make ambition by base man term sin a big and gallant virtue you have be nurse lull as it be into your infant sleep by the surly noise of the trumpet which now summon you to victorious use of your endowment and shall a mistress stay you such a one too as to attempt than war itself be more dangerous 

all these persuasion be to as much purpose as you shall strive to reinvest with peace and all the joy of health and life a soul condemn to perpetuity of torment no my Tarifa though through all disgrace loss of my honour fame nay hope for empire I shall be force to wade to obtain her love those sea of mischief will be please stream which I will haste to bathe in and pass through they with that delight thou will to victory or slave long chain to the oar to sudden freedom 

be you not Abilqualit from this time then our friendship like two river from one head rise shall wander a dissever course and never meet again unless to quarrel nay old and stiff now as my iron garment be you my son my sword shall teach your wildness a swift way to repentance you be my prince on who all hope depend think on your father that lively image of majestic goodness who never yet wrong matron in his lust or man in his displeasure pray conjecture your father country army by my mouth beseech your piety to a early pity of your yet unslain innocence no attention farewell my prayer shall wait you though my counsel be thus despise farewell prince 

alas good man he weep such tear I have see fall from his manly eye once when you lose a battle why shall I put off my reason valour honour virtue in hope to gain a beauty who possession render i more uncapable of peace than I be now I want it like a sweet much covet banquet it be no soon taste but it be delicious luxury be forget beside it be unlawful idle fool there be no law but what be prescribe by love nature first move organ nor can aught what nature dictate to we be hold vicious on then my soul and destitute of fear like a adventurous mariner that know storm must attend he yet dare court his peril strive to obtain this happy port Methises love cunning advocate do for i besiege with gift and vow her chastity she be compass with flesh that be not invulnerable and may by love sharp dart be pierce they stand firm who no art can bring to Love command 

my gracious brother 

dear Abrahen welcome it be certain decree by our dread father we must both march against the insult foe how do thy youth yet uninjured to travel relish the employment 

war be sweet to those that never have experience it my youth can desire in that big art a noble tutor than you my Brother● like a eglet follow her dam I shall your honour step trace through all danger and be proud to borrow a branch when your head be cover over with laurel to deck my humble temple 

I do know thou of valiant active soul and though a youth thy forward spirit merit the command of chief rather than second in a army will heaven our royal father have bestow on thou the charge of general 

on i sir Alas it be fit I first shall know those art that do distinguish valour from wild rashness a general brother must have able nerve of judgement then in my youth can be hope for yourself already like a flourish spring teem with early victory the soldier expect shall lead they to new triumph as if you have vanquish fortune 

I be not so ambitious Abrahen of particular glory but I will have those who I love partake they this persian war the last of the whole east leave to be manage if I can persuade the great Almanzor shall be the trophy of thy yet maiden valour I have do enough already to inform succession that Abilqualit dare on fierce foe run to fetch conquest home and will have thy name as great as i in arm that history may register our family abound with hero bear for victory 

it be a honour which though it be above my power commit to my direction I will seek to manage with care above my year and courage equal to he that dare the horrid face of danger but it be your noble courtesy will thrust this masculine honour far above his merit on your regardless brother for my father he have no thought tend to your intention nor though your goodness shall desire will hardly be win to yield consent to they 

why my Abrahen we be both his son and shall be both alike dear to his affection and though birth have give i the large hope and title it be unnatural shall he not strive to endow thou with a portion apt to the magnificence of his offspring but thou perhaps be timorous lest thy first essay of valour shall meet fate disastrous the bold be fortune darling if thou have courage to venture on this great employment doubt not I shall prevail upon our father to ordain thou chief in this brave hopeful voyage 

you imagine i beyond all thought of gratitude and doubt not that I will deceive your trust the glorious ensign wave in the air once like so many comet shall speak the persian funeral on who ruin we will build to fame and victory new temple which shall like pyramid preserve our memory when we be change to ash 

be sure continue in this brave mind I will instant solicit our father to confirm thou in the charge of general I will about it 

farewell gracious brother This hap above my hope alas good dull fool I see through thy intent clear as thy soul be as transparent as thin air or crystal he will have i remove march with the army that he mean time may make a sure defeat on our age father life and empire it must be certain as the light why shall not this with equal heat be like my thought ambitious be they as harmless as the prayer of virgin I will work his ruin out of his intention he like a thick cloud stand betwixt i and greatness greatness the wise man true felicity honour be direct inheritance my youth will quit suspicion of my subtle practice then have I surly Mura and Simanthes my ally by my dead mother blood my assistant his eunuch too Mesithes at my service Simanthes shall inform the king the people desire prince Abilqualit stay and Mura who blunt demeanour render he oraculous make a shrewd inference out of it he be my half brother the other be my father name mere airy title sovereignty be only sacred greatness goodness true selfaffection justice every thing righteous that be helpful to create a king 

my trusty friend you be welcome our fate be above our wish Abilqualit by whatsoever power move to his own ruin will fain enforce his charge of general on i and stay at home 

why how can this conduce to advance our purpose 

it be the main engine can ever move to ruin he Simanthes you shall inform our father it be the people out of their tender love desire his stay you Mura shall infer my brother greatness with people out of it how nice it be and dangerous the air be open here come we will discourse with more secure privacy our purpose nothing be unjust unsacred tend to advance we to a kingdom that be the height of chance 

how not go Simanthes 

my dread sovereign I speak but what the well affect people out of their loyal care and pious duty enjoin i utter they do look upon he as on your elder son and next successor and will be loath the persian war shall rob their eye of light their soul of joy and comfort this flourish empire leave as it be widow of its love spouse they humble do beseech your majesty will therefore destine some more fit general who loss as heaven avert such a misfortune shall it happen may less concern the state 

it be not the least among the blessing heaven have shower upon we that we be happy in such love subject to govern who when we in peace be ash we leave they a successor who they true reverence a love people and a love sovereign make kingdom true fortunate and flourish but I believe Simanthes their intent though we confirm they will scarce take effect my Abilqualit like a princely lion in view of his prey will scarce be overcome to leave the honour of the persian war in his hope already vanquish by his valour and rest in lazy quiet while that triumph be ravish by another 

with the pardon of your most sacred majesty it be fit then your great command forbid the prince voyage boldness enforce youth to hard achievement before their time make they run forth like lapwing from their warm nest part of the shell yet stick unto their downy head sir good success be oft more fatal far than bad one win ●●st from a flatter die tempt a gamester to hazard his whole fortune 

this be dull fruitless philosophy he that fall noble win as much honour by his loss as conquest 

this rule may hold well among common man but not among prince such a prince as we be who know as well to conquer man affection as he do enemy shall not be expose to every new cause honourable danger prince Abilqualit fair and win carriage have steal possession of the people heart they dote on he since his late spanish conquest as new make bride on their much covet husband and they will pine like melancholy turtle shall they so soon lose the unvalued object both of their love and reverence howsoever whatever your awful will sir shall determine as heaven be by their strict obedience hold sacred and religious 

good Simanthes let they receive our thank for their true care of our dear Abilqualit we will consider of their request say 

your highness humble creature 

I do not like this 

like what valiant Mura we know thy counsel so supreme wise and thy true heart so excellent faithful that whatsoever displease thy sage judgement Almanzor wisdom must account distasteful what be it dislike thou 

your majesty know i a downright soldier I affect not word but to be brief I relish not your son shall as if you be in your tomb already engross so much the giddy people favour it be neither fit for he nor safe for you to suffer it 

why how can they Mura give a more serious testimony of reverence to i then by confer their affection their pious wish zealous contemplation on he that sit the near to my heart my Abilqualit in who hopeful virtue my age more glorious than in all my conquest 

may you prove fortunate in your pious care of the prince Abilqualit but my lord Mura be not so prone to idle language the parasite best ornament to utter o●ght but what if you will please to give he audience he will show you a blunt reason for 

Come I see into thy thought good Mura too much care of we inform thy loyal soul with fear the prince too much popularity may breed our danger banish those suspicion neither dare they who under my long reign have be triumphant in so many blessing have the least thought may tend to disobedience or if they have my Abilqualit goodness will never consent with they to become impious 

it be too secure a confidence betray mind valiant to irreparable danger not that I dare invade with a foul think the noble prince loyalty but my lord when this same many head beast the people violent and so not constant in affection subject to love of novelty the sickness proper to all humane special light nature do magnify with too immoderate praise the prince action dote upon his presence nay chain their soul to the shadow of his footstep as all excess ought to be hold dangerous especial when they do aim at sceptre their too much dotage speak you in their wish be dead already that their darling hope the prince may have the throne once 

it be confess all this a serious truth 

their mad applause of the noble prince though he be true virtuous may force ambition into he a mischief seize the soul with too much craft and sweetness as pride or lust do mind unstayed and wanton it make man like poison rat which when they have swallow the please bane rest not until they drink and can rest then much less until they burst with it 

thy word be still oraculous 

pray then think with what a easy toil the haughty prince a demi God by the popular acclamation nay the world sovereign in the vulgar wish have he a resolution to be wicked may snatch this diadem from your age temple what law so holy tie of blood so mighty which for a crown mind sanctify and religious have not presume to violate how much more than may the soul dazzle glory of a sceptre work in his youth who constitution be fiery as overheat air and have to fan it into a flame the breath of love and praise blow by strong thought of his own worth and action 

no more of this good Mura 

they dare already limit your intention demand as it be with cunning zeal which right interpret be insolence the prince abode at home I will not say it be but I guess it may be their subtle purpose while we abroad fight for new kingdom purchase deprive by that mean of our faithful succour they may deprive you of this crown enforce upon the prince this diadem which however he may be loath to accept be once possess of it and taste the delight of supreme greatness he will be more loath to part with to prevent this not that I think it will but that may happen it be fit the prince march I have observe in he too of late a sullen melancholy whence rise I will not conjecture only I shall grieve sir beyond a moderate sorrow traitorous practice shall take that from you which with loyal blood we and your own victorious arm have purchase and now I have discharge my honest conscience censure on it as you please henceforth I be silent 

will thou have be so now thy loyal fear have make i see how miserable a king be who rule depend on the vain people suffrage Black now and horrid as the face of storm appear all Abilqualit lovely virtue because to i they only make he dangerous and with great terror shall behold those action which with delight before we view and dotage like mariner that bless the peaceful sea which when suspect to grow up tempestuous they tremble at though he may still be virtuous it be wisdom in we to he no injustice to keep a vigilant eye over his proceed and the wild people purpose 

Abilqualit come to take your leave I do conjecture 

Rather sir to beg your gracious licence I may still at home attend your dread command and that you will please to nominate my hopeful brother Abrahen in lieu of i chief of your now raise force for the persian expedition 

dare you sir presume to make this suit to we 

why my royal lord I hope this can pull your anger on your most obedient son a true affection to the young prince my brother do beget this my request I willing will have his youth adorn with glory of this conquest no tree bear fruit in autumn less it blossom first in the spring it be fit he be acquaint in these soft year with military action that when grow perfect man he may grow up too perfect in warlike discipline 

hereafter we shall by your appointment guide our counsel why do you not entreat i to resign my crown that you the people much love minion may with it impale your glorious brow sir henceforth or know your duty better or your pride shall meet our just wake anger to your charge and march with speed or you shall know what it be to disobey our pleasure when you be king learn to command your subject I will my sir you know your charge perform it 

I have do our hope I see resemble much the sun that rise and decline cast large shadow but when his beam be dress in his midday brightness yield none at all when they be far from success their guilt reflection do display the large show of event fair and prosperous with what a settle confidence do I promise myself my stay here Mura wish departure when stead of these I find my father wrath destroy my intention such a fool be selfcompassion soothe we to faith of what we wish shall hap while vain desire of thing we have not make we quite forget those we be possess of 

alone the engine work beyond or hope or credit how I hug with vast delight beyond that of steal pleasure forbid lover taste my darling mistress my active brain if I can be thus subtle while a young serpent when grow up a dragon how glorious shall I be in cunning practice my gracious brother 

gentle Abrahen I be grieve my power can comply my promise my father be so averse from grant my request concern thou that with angry frown he do express rather a passionate rage than a refusal civil or accustom to his indulgent disposition 

he be our father and so the tyrant custom do enforce we to yield he that which fool call natural when wise man know it be more than servile duty a slavish blind obedience to his pleasure be it nor just nor honourable 

o my Abrahen these sound be unharmonious as unlooked for from thy unblemished innocence though he can put off paternal piety it give no privilege for we to wander from our filial duty though harsh and to our nature much unwelcome be his decree like those of heaven we must not presume to question they 

not if they concern our life and fortune it be not for myself I urge these doubt but it be for you who be my brother and I hope must be my sovereign my fear grow on i almost to distraction our father age betray he to a dotage which may be dangerous to your future safety he do suspect your loyalty 

how Abrahen 

I know it will start your innocence but it be truth a sad and serious truth nay his suspicion almost arrive unto a settle faith that you be ambitious 

it be impossible 

the glorious shine of your illustrious virtue be grow too bright and dazzle for his eye to look on as he ought with admiration and he with fear behold they as it be through a perspective where each brave action of you survey though at remote distance appear far great than it be in brief that love which you have purchase from the people that sing glad hymn to your victorious fortune betray you to his hate and in this voyage which he enforce you to undertake he have set spy upon you 

it be so affliction do fall like hailstone one not soon drop but a whole shower do follow I observe indeed my Abrahen that his look and language be dress in unaccustomed cloud but do not imagine they will presage so fierce a tempest you god why do you give we gift and grace share your own attribute with man your virtue when they betray they to worse hate than vice but Abrahen prithee reconfirm my fear by testimonial how this can be truth for yet my innocence with too credulous trust soothe up my soul our father shall not thus put that off which do make he so his sweetness to feed the irregular flame of false suspicion and soul torment jealousy 

why to i to i my lord he do with strong injunction give a solicitous charge to overlook your action my Abrahen quoth he I be not so unhappy that like thy brother thou shall be ambitious who do affect before thy age father ash with greedy lust my empire have a strict and cautious diligence to observe his carriage it will be a pious care move with the base indignity that he on i shall force the office of a spy your spy my noble and much love brother my best manhood scarce can keep my angry tear in I resolve I be in duty bind to give you early intelligence of his unjust intention that you in wisdom may prevent all danger may fall upon you from they like swift lightning kill because they invade with sudden fierceness 

in afflict i misery be grow witty 

nay beside sir the sullen Mura have the self same charge too consign and settle on he which his blind duty will execute o brother your soft passive nature do like jet on fire when oil cast on it extinguish otherwise this base suspicion will inflame your sufferance nay make the pure loyalty rebellious however though your too religious piety force you endure this foul disgrace with patience look to your safety brother that dear safety which be not only you but your whole empire for my part if a faithful brother service may aught avail you though against our father since he can be so unnatural suspicious as your own thought command it 

Come I know although thou have lose some implement of manhood may make thou gracious in the sight of woman yet thou have a little engine call a tongue by which thou can overcome the nice female in the behalf of friend insooth you eunuch may well be style pimproyal for the skill you have in quaint procurement 

your lordship be merry and will enforce on i what have be your office far often than the cunning squire belong to the smock transitory may it please your highness 

ha Mesithes 

his countenance vary strange some affair the eunuch give he notice of it shall seem beget much pleasure in he 

be this truth mes else let i taste your anger

can your grace imagine whether his highness go now 

no Selinthus can thou conjecture at the eunuch business whatever it be his countenance seem much alter I will give a talon to have certain knowledge what be Mesithes message 

I will inform you at a far easy rate Mesithes business certes concern a limber petticoat and the smock soft and slippery on my honour have be provide for the prince some female that he take his leave of lady flesh ere his departure 

not improbable it may be so 

nay certain sir it be so and I believe your little body earn after the same sport you be once report a wag will have have business of engender with surly Mura lady and man may conjecture you be no chaste than a votary yet though she will not solace your desire there be as handsome lady will be proud to have your grace inoculate their stock with your graftroyal 

thou be Selinthus still and will not change thy humour I must go and find out Mura so farewell Selinthus thou be not for these war I know 

no true nor yet for any other lest it be on a naked yield enemy though there may be as hot service upon such a foe as on those clad in steel the little squadron we civil man assault body to body oft carry wildfire about they private that singe we in the service from the crown even to the sole nay sometime hair and all off but these be transitory peril enter Gasilles Osman cousin I think you have be dance to the drum your general have give order for a march this night I can assure you 

it be cousin something of the soon but we be prepare at all time for the journey 

tomorrow morning may serve the turn though hark you cousin i if in this persian war you chance to take a handsome she captive pray you be not unmindful of we your friend at home I will disburse her ransom cousin for I have a month mind to try if strange flesh or that of our own country have the complete relish 

we will accomplish thy pleasure noble cozen 

but pray do not take the first say of she yourselves I do not love to walk after any of my kindred in the path of copulation 

the first fruit shall be thy own dear cousin but shall we part never perhaps to meet again with dry lip my right honour coz 

by no mean though by the Alcharon wine be forbid you soldier in that case make it not your faith drink water in the camp when you can purchase no other liquor here you shall have plenty of wine old and delicious I will be your leader and bring you on let who will bring you off to the encounter come let we march cousin 

no more my gracious lord where real love be needless be all expression ceremonious the amorous turtle that at first acquaintance strive to express in murmur note their love do when agree on their affection change their chirp to bill 

and in feather arm encompass mutual their gawdy neck 

how do you like these love trick Perilinda 

very well but one may soon hope from a dead man to receive kindness than from thou a eunuch ● you be the cold creature in the body no snowball like you 

we must needs who have not that which like fire shall warm our constitution the instrument of copulation girl our toy to please the lady 

Caropia in your well become pity of my extreme affliction and stern suffering you have show that excellent mercy as must render whatever action you can fix on virtuous but lady I till now have be your tempter one that desire hear the brave resistance you make my brother when he woo your love only to boast the glory of a conquest which seem impossible now I have gain it by be vanquisher I myself be vanquish your everlasting captive 

then the thraldom will be as prosperous as the please bondage of palm that flourish most when bow down fast constraint make sweet and easy thing laborious when love make great misery seem pleasure yet it be ambition sir join with affection that give i up a spoil to your temptation I be resolve if ever I do make a breach on matrimonial faith it shall be with he that be the darling of kind fortune as well as liberal nature who possess the height of greatness to adorn his beauty which since they both conspire to make you happy I think it will be a great sin to suffer your hopeful person bear to sway this empire in love hot flame to languish by refusal to a consume fever than to infringe a vow which never proceed from my heart when I unwilling make it

blade of metal tall man of war an it please your grace of my own blood and family man who gather a salad on the enemy ground and eat it in bold defiance of he and not a soldier here but be a Achilles valiant as stout Myrmidon 

and they never have just cause to show their valour the prince my dear brother their lord general be become a forfeit to the stern law rigour and it be imagine our impartial father will sentence he to lose his eye 

marry heaven defend for what and it like your grace 

for a fact which the severe law punish with loss of nature precious light my tear will scarce permit i utter it for a rape commit on the fair wife of Mura 

be it for nothing else and please your grace ere he shall lose a eye for such a trifle or have a hair diminish we will lofe our head what hoodwink man like sullen hawk for do deed of nature I be ashamed the law be such a ass 

some eunuch judge that can not be acquaint with the sweet due to concupiscential part invent this law I will be hang else be life a prince and such a hopeful one to lose his eye for satisfy the hunger of the stomach beneath the waist be cruelty prodigious not to be suffer in a commonwealth of aught but gelding 

it be vain to soothe our hope with these delusion he will suffer less he be rescue I will have you therefore if you owe any service to the prince my much lament brother to attend without least tumult about the court and if there be necessity of your aid I will give you notice when to employ it

for he that flinch in such a cause I will have no more mercy on he here be Tarifa enter Tarifa and Mura the prince sometime tutor Mura with he a walk towards the court let we take no notice of they lest they discover our intention by our grim look march fair and soft cousin we will be at court before they 

you will not do this Mura 

how Tarifa will you defend he in a act so impious be it fit the drum shall cease his surly language when the bold soldier march or that I shall pass over this affront in quiet silence which god and man invoke to speedy vengeance which I will have or manhood shall be tame as cowardice 

it be a deed so barbarous that truth itself blush as well as justice to hear it mention but consider Mura he be our prince the empire hope and pillar of great Almanzor age how far a public regard shall be prefer before your private desire of vengeance which if you do purchase from our impartial emperor equity his loss of sight and so of the succession will not restore Caropia to the honour he ravish from she but so foul the cause be I rather shall lament the prince folly than plead in his behalf 

it be but vain there be your warrant as you be high marshal to summon he to make his speedy appearance before the tribunal of Almanzor so pray you execute your office 

how one vice can like a small cloud when it break forth in shower black the whole heaven of virtue o my lord enter Abilqualit muts whisper seem to make protestation exeunt that face of you which once with angel brightness cheer my faint sight like a grim apparition fright it with ghastly terror you have do a deed that startle virtue till it shake as it get a palsy I be command to summon you before your father and hope you will obey his mandate 

willing what be my offence Tarifa 

will you know not I do presage your too unruly passion will hurry you to some disastrous act but never imagine you will have be so lose to masculine honour to commit a rape on that unhappy object of your love who now you have make the spoil of your foul lust the much wrong wife of Mura 

why do Mura charge i with his Caropia rape 

this warrant send by your angry father testify he mean to appeach you of it 

it be my fortune all natural motion when they approach their end haste to draw to it with accustom swiftness Rivers with greedy speed run near their outfall than at their spring but I be resolve let what happen that will I will stand it and defend Caropia honour though my own I ruin who dare not die to justify his love deserve not to enjoy she Come Tarifa whatever befall I be resolute he die glorious that fall love innocent sacrifice 

no more Tarifa you will provoke our anger if you appear in this cause so solicitous the act be too apparent nor shall you need injure Mura to implore our justice which with impartial doom shall fall on he more rigorous then on a strange offender o Abilqualit for the name of son when thou forsake thy native virtue leave thou be all thy blood thy youth and fortune glory of no more value than to be expose to ruin for one vice at who name only the fury start and bashful front justice hide her amaze head but it be now bootless to show a father pity in my grief for thy amiss as I be to be thy judge be resolute I will take as little notice thou be my offspring as the wander cloud do of the shower which when they have breed to ripeness they straight disperse through the vast earth forget 

I be sorry sir that my unhappy chance shall draw your anger on i my long silence declare I have on that excel sweetness that unexampled pattern of chaste goodness Caropia act violence I confess I love the lady and when no persuasion serve to prevail on she too stubborn incensed by force I seek my purpose and obtain it nor do I yet so much I prize the sweetness of that unvalued purchase find repentance in any abject thought whatever fall on i from your stern rigor in a cause so precious will be a please punishment 

yond be grow a glorious malefactor that dare brave thus the awful rod of justice lose young man for thou be no child of i do not consider to what a state of desperate destruction thy wild lust have betray thou what rich blessing that I may make thou sensible of thy sin by show thou thy suffering have thou lose by thy irregular folly first my love which never more must meet thou scarce in pity the glory flow from thy former action stop up for ever and those lustful eye by who deprival thou be deprive of be capable of this empire to the law which will exact they forfeit call in there a surgeon and our mutt to execute this act enter Surg muts of justice on the unworthy traitor upon who my just wake wrath shall have no more compassion than the incense flame have on perish wretch that wilful leap into they 

o my lord that which on other will be fit justice on he your hopeful though offend son will be exemplar cruelty his youth sir that have abound with so many virtue be a excuse sufficient for one vice he be not you only he be your empire destine by nature and succession privilege when you in peace be shroud in your marble to wield this sceptre after you o do not by put out his eye deprive your subject of light and leave they to dull mournful darkness 

it be but in vain I be inexorable if those on which his eye hang be my heart string I will cut they out rather than wound my justice nor do befit thy virtue intercede for he in this cause horrid and prodigious the crime against i be act it be a rape upon my honour more than on her whiteness his be from my derivative as each stream be from its spring so that he have pollute by his foul fact my fame my truth my goodness strike through my dignity by his violence nay start in their peaceful urn the ash of all my glorious ancestor defile the memory of their still descendent virtue nay with a kill frost nip the fair blossom that do presage such goodly fruit arise from his own hopeful youth 

I ask but justice those eye that lead he to unlawful object it be fit shall suffer for it a last blindness the sun himself when he dart ray lascivious such as engender by too pierce fervence intemperate and infectious heat straight wear obscurity from the cloud his own beam raise I have be your soldier sir and fight your battle for all my service I beg but justice which be the subject best prerogative the prince great attribute and for a fact than which none can be hold more black and hideous which have betray to a eclipse the bright star in the heaven of virtue the just law do for it ordain a punishment which I hope you the law righteous guider will accord to equity see execute 

why that law be only make for common malefactor but have no force to extend unto the prince to who the law itself must become subject this hopeful prince look on he great Almanzor and in his eye those volume of all grace which you like err meteor will extinguish read your own lively figure the best story of your youth noble vigour let not wrath sir overcome your piety nay your humane pity it be in your breast my lord yet to show mercy that precious attribute of heaven true goodness even to yourself your son methinks that name shall have a power to interdict your justice in its too rigorous progress 

dear Tarifa I be more afflict at the intercession then at the view of my approach torment which I will meet with fortitude and boldness too base to shake now at one personal danger when I have encounter thousand peril fearless nor do I blame my gracious father justice though it precede his nature I will not have he for my sake forfeit that for which he be famous his uncorrupted equity nor repine I at my destiny my eye have have delight sufficient in Caropia beauty to serve my thought● for after contemplation nor can I ever covet a new object since they can never hope to encounter any of equal worth and sweetness yet hark Tarifa to thy secrecy I will impart my dear inmost counsel if I shall perish as it be probable I may under the hand of these tormentor thou may unto succession show my innocence Caropia yield without least constraint and I enjoy she free

it be his fear make he traduce her innocence he who do not stick to commit a riot on her person can make no conscience to destroy her fame by his untrue suggestion 

it be a baseness beyond thy other villainy have she yield thus to betray for transitory torture her honour which thou be engage to safeguard even with thy life a son of i can never show this ignoble cowardice proceed to execution I will not hear he speak he be make up of treachery and falsehood 

Will you then be to the prince so tyrannous why to i just now he do confess his only motive to undergo this torment be to save Caropia honour blameless 

I be more trouble sir with his untimely frenzy then with my punishment his too much love to i have spoil his temperate reason I confess Caropia yield not the light be half so innocent as her spotless virtue it be not well do Tarifa to betray the secret of your friend thus though she yield the terror of ten thousand death shall never force i to confess it
