unmask thy face thou minister of time 
look forth bright mirror let thy gold hand 
ride with distinctless motion on the eye 
of this fair chorus till the reign of peace 
have propagate plenty and increase 
now sit we high triumphant in our sway 
encircle with the sevenfold flower of art 
to tread on barbarism with silver foot 
these these be adjunct fit to wait on peace 
who be court by most search spirit 
have always bear themselves in godlike state 
with lofty forehead high than the star 
draw near fair daughter of eternity 
your fostress peace be like the age nurse 
grow proud to see her child flourish thus 

we know not how to turn these bounty back 
but with continuance of obsequious love 
while peace triumph it lie in grammar may 
to make the rude brain both speak and write 

logic shall furnish they with argument 
and make they apt and able to dispute 
the theme shall be of peace and her sweet name 
and every syllogism shall prove her fame 

rhetoric will put her rich habit on 
of gesture voice and exornation 
her trope and scheme shall dignify her sense 
and honour peace with clear eloquence 

her grace in my number shall be see 
so full that nothing can be add more 
nor aught subtract true arithmetic 
will multiply and make they infinite 

music shall feast the bounteous ear of peace 
while she inspire her numb conceit with life 
vary each concord mood and faculty 
in flow strain and rapt symphony 

the motion of the planet and their sphere 
the star their influence quantity consent 
all that astronomy can teach or know 
she do profess from sacred peace to flow 

and I will make her power demonstrative 
in all my angle circle cube or square 
the very state of peace shall seem to shine 
in every figure or dimensive line 

enough fair virgin time shall prove this true 
while you do honour peace she will cherish you 

honour and safety still attend fair peace 

thank noble lord and worthy gentleman 
but wherefore look you so askance on these 
as if they be not worthy your salute 

because we know they not 

the more your blame 

o pity state most weak where noble want 
the love and knowledge of the liberal art 
be you the man for birth and place admire 
by who great motion lesser wheel turn round 
and shall your mind affect so dull a course 
as if your sense where most irrational 
what be a man superior to a beast 
but for his mind nor that ennoble he 
while he deject his reason make it 
the slave unto his brutish appetite 
make then your mind illustrious in your deed 
and each choose in this troop a spousal mate 

we do obey and I choose music first 

I geometry 

I rhetoric 

and I astronomy 

and I to be a servant unto all 

but now beware you injure not the fame 
of these bright virgin with adulterate love 
mean time their servant here Chrisoganus 
shall teach of every art the mystery 

but if by art as all our artist say 
there be no real truth to be attain 
why shall we labour in their love bestow 
the wise say I know I nothing know 

the wise be a fool for say so 
that oracle pronounce wise Socrates 
for do I know I see you or the light 
or do you know you hear i or I touch you 

all this we needs must know assure 

if this be certain then which come from sense 
the knowledge proper to the soul be true 
for that pure knowledge by the which we know 
a thing to be with true cause how it be 
be more exact than that which know it be 
and reach not to knowledge of the cause 
beside that knowledge that consider thing 
abjunct from sencive matter be exacter 
then that which join itself with element 
arithmetic ever consider number 
abstract from sencive matter music still 
consider it with sense as mix with sound 
therefore arithmetic be more exact 
and more exact than be geometry 
since unitas be still simplicior puncto 
and number simple than be magnitude 
for vnitas may still be sine puncto 
but punctus never without unity 
nor magnitudo sine numero 
dum enim punctus ponitur ponitur ex necessitate unitas 

but all this prove not we may know a truth 

if we have this we call scientia 
we must have truth of mere necessity 
for Acribeia do not signify 
only a certainty in that we know 
but certainty with all perfection 

although I be not satisfy in this 
it do i good to hear he thus discourse 

my lord let we betake we to our study 

in nothing be I better please let we go 

this peace breed such plenty trade serve no turn 

the more fool we to follow they 

let we make up a company of player 
for we can all sing and say 
and so with practice soon may learn to play 

true can our action answer your extempore 

I will teach you to play true politician 

why those be the false subtle fellow live 

I pray sir what title have travail player 

why properfellow they play lord and king 

what part will best become we sir I pray 

faith to play rogue till we be bind for run away 

content scrivener ho 
you must tie a knot of knave together 

your appellation 

your name he mean the man be learn 

I belch the beardmaker 

I gut the fiddlestringmaker 

I incle the pedlar 

I master Posthast the poet 

your nomenclature 

o stately scrivener that be where dwell you 

townsman townsman all 

the obligatory condition 

politician player 

but who man be we all this while

what a greasy phrase this play will furnish you

let we away 

master Fourcher how fare your body sir come you from your book 

troth master lyonrash this peace give lawyer leave to play 

master Vourcher you be very well encounter sir 

master velure I value your friendship at as high a price as any man 

gentleman how shall we spend this afternoon 

faith let we go see a play 

see a play a proper pastime indeed to here a deal of prate to so little purpose 

why this go to a play be now all in the fashion 

why then let we go where we may hear sweet music and delicate song for the harmony of music be so heavenlike that I love it with my life 

nay faith this afternoon we will spend in hear the mathematics read 

why then let we to the academy to hear Crisoganus 

content 

master Chrisoganus by your leave sir 

gentleman you be welcome 

I pray sir what be the best course for a scholar 

why no man can attain to any truth 
but he must seek it Mathematic√© 

which be the mathematic science 

arithmetic and geometry be chief 

what difference be there betwixt philosophy 
and knowledge which be mathematical 

this sir the natural philosopher 
consider thing as mere sensible 
the mathematician ut mente abjunctas a materia sensibili 
but this require time to satisfy 
for it be a axiom with all man of art 
mathematicum abstrahentem non comittere mendacium 
and for the beauty of it what can be 
urge more extractive then the face of heaven 
the mystery that art have find therein 
it be distinguish into region 
those region fill with sundry sort of star 
they likewise christen with peculiar name 
to see a daily use wrought out of they 
with demonstration so infallible 
the pleasure can be but ravish 

the very thought thereof inflame i 

why you shall meet with project so remove 
from vulgar apprehension as for instance 
the sun here rise in the east with we 
but not of his own proper motion 
as be turn by primum mobile 
the heaven above coelum stellatum 
whereas his true assent be in the west 
and so he consummate his circle course 
in the ecliptic line which part the zodiac 
be bear from Tropic to Tropic this time 
we call a year who hieroglyphic be 
among the egyptian figure in a snake 
wreathe circular the tail within his mouth 
as happy the latin since do call 
a ring of the word annus annulus 

I apprehend not in my able power 
that once in every four and twenty hour 
the sun shall rise and set yet be a year 
in finish his own design course 

why that I will demonstrate to you thus 
turn a huge wheel contrary to the sway 
place i a fly upon it the fly before 
it can arrive the point from whence it go 
shall sundry time be circumvolve about 
even so the sun and the affinity 
for if you wonder how at oneself hour 
two of discordant nature may be bear 
as one a king another some base swain 
one valiant and the other timorous 
let but two drop of ink or water fall 
direct on so swift a turn wheel 
and you shall find they both cast far in sunder 
Even so the heavenly orb whirl so fast 
and so impetuous project man fate 
most full of change and contrariety 

can faith these knowledge be very rare 
and full of admiration be they not 

the mathematics be the strength of truth 
a magazine of all perfection 

shall we design some place for exercise 
and every morning have a lecture read 

content if so Chrisoganus stand please 
his exhibition shall be competent we will all be patron 

to make you artist answer my desire 
rather than hope or mercenary hire 

reach i the bowl with rich autumnian juice 
that I may drink a health to your new queen 
time wing hour that point out my reign 
be flee I be no more your sovereign 
wound air with shrill tune canzonet 
I rob myself to make my daughter rich 
peace do resign her pure imperial crown 
wrought by the Muse in who circle grow 
all flower that be to Phoebus consecrate 

what heavenly sovereignty support my state 
that plenty reign as princess after peace 
then if this powerful arm can turn the hour 
it be my will and that shall stand for law 
that all thing on the earth be plentiful 
I crush out bounty from the amber grape 
and fill your barn with swell sheaf of corn 
how can this but engender bless thought 
especial when god our good have seek 

for thou thy servant captivate the earth 
her fruitfulness fall down at plenty foot 

Bacchus will cheer her melancholy sense 
with drop of nectar from this crimson juice 

her body shall sustain ten thousand wound 
and swarthy India be transform to sea 
disgorge golden choler to the wave 
before sweet plenty find the least defect 

for this abundance pour at plenty foot 
you shall be tetrarch of this petty world 

what dullard thus will dote in rusty art 
plod upon a book to dull the sense 
and see the world become a treasurehouse 
where angel swarm like bee in plenty street 
and every peasant surfeit on their sweet 

give i a season that will stir the blood 
I like not niggardise to hungerstarve 
it be good when poorman frolic in the hall 
the while our father in the chamber feast 
and none repine at any strangerguest 

who be the author of this store but peace 
that commonwealth be never well at ease 
where parchment skin who use shall bear record 
must head their brawl drum and keep a coil 
as if they threaten plenty with a spoil 

your house must be open to the poor 
your dusty table fill with store of meat 
let goodly yeoman at your elbow stand 
sword by their side and trencher in their hand 
longskirted coat widesleeve with cloth enough 
thus lord you shall my government enlarge 
reverence your queen by practise her charge 

we be the charge and thy the empire

to fit the plenteous humour of the time

that cleave to they till you confound yourself 

poor scholar spend thy spirit so and die 

let they do so that list so will not 

I can feed my appetite with air 
I must pursue my pleasure royal 
that sponge in sweat I may return from sport 
mount i on horseback keep the hound and hawk 
and leave this idle contemplation 
to rugged stoical morosophist

why shall yond bubble of nobility 
yond shade of man appropriate epithet 
of noble and right honourable sir 
to the blind fortune of his happy birth 
why shall this reel world drink with the juice 
of plenty bounty give such attribute 
of sovereign title place and dignity 
to that same swell up lord who blind chance

to high exalt state while all repine 
to see our sweat reward and our pain

on who incertainty our certain ground 
of tower height shall stand invincible 
the dubious law shall nurse dissension 
which be pamper with our feed help 
we will swell in greatness and our palace tower

Come on player now we be the sharer 
and you the hire man nay you must take patience 
slide how do you march 
sirrah be this you will rend and tear the cat 
upon a stage and now march like a drown rat 
look up and play the Tamburlaine you rogue you 

thus heaven in spite of fury can preserve 
the trustful innocent and guiltless soul 
oh what a thing be man that thus forget 
the end of his creation and each hour 
strike at the glory of his maker thus 
what brazen visage or black iron soul 
have strength to justify so godless deed 
he that be most enfeoff to tyranny 
the man who jaw burn most with thirst of blood 
what colour or thin cobweb can he weave 
to cover so abhor iniquity 
if then there be no shadow no pretext 
to veil their loathe body what shall make 
man so enamour on this strumpet war 
to dote upon her form when in herself 
she be make of nothing but infectious plague 
witness the present chaos of our scene 
where every street be chain with link of spoil 
here proud ambition ride there fury fly 
here horror and there ruthless murder stalk 
lead on by ruin and in steel and fire 
that now on top of house now in vault 
now in the sacred temple here and there 
run wild 

reign poverty in spite of tragic war 
and triumph over glitter vanity 
though want be never void of bitter woe 
yet slowpaced remedy true patience show 
see worldling world of virtue line within 
though sinner all yet least replete with sin 
I scorn a scoff fool about my throne 
a artless idiot that like Esop daw 
plume fair feather bird no poverty 
will dignify her chair with deep divine 
philosopher and scholar feast with i 
as well as martialist in misery 
first change the hour from five to fatal six 
then ring forth knell of heavy discontent 
with sigh and groan while I have government 

thin famine needs must follow poverty 
my bone lie open like a wither tree 
by storm disbark of she defend skin 
so near the heart the weather beat within 

o end thy age that we may end our day 
once object now all abject to the world 
for after feeble sickness death ensue 
and end grief that happy joy renew 

then bondage shall unbolt those cruel bar 
that thrall fair honour in obscure reproach 
and savagelike yoke up humanity 
to bind in chain trueborn civility 

though sluttishness be loathsome to herself 
penurious time must be obscene and base 
who hate the rich must dwell with poverty 
since rule in any thing be sovereignty 

Were poverty a word more miserable 
than man austere invention can propound 
yet be poor honesty rich honour ground 
who eye unveil like to the unhood hawk 
look straight on high and in the end aspire 
to feel the warmth of prince holy fire 
yet honour wealth land and who win the prize 
obtain but vanity of vanity 
Come follow i my never fail friend 

the broil of war wherein I glory more 
than Priam Hector who by burn wall 
be trail along dread victory deep fall 
so from these gate myself in mean disgrace 
be banish forth pinch through with poverty 
who tell we all it be true that she have say 
poor fly will tickle lion be dead 

the thirst of honour call i to the war 
where I have drink a health too deep a draught 
my fullmouthed bag may now be fill with air 
the devil and ambition teach it i 

be that Philarchus that complain it be so 

see how Mavortius turn away his face 
to seek to friend it be hold for disgrace 

time be I can have dine among my friend 
now stand at every door a lack and ape 
and tell i it be too late his lord have dine 

this miserable world will make one mad 
I step unto a vintner at the bar 
and offer he my rapier for a pawn 
the saucy slave take it in such a scorn 
and fling it in the street reply thus 
mere want bring weapon out of use with we 

see poor Philarchus pour out his plaint 
to unrelenting wall relentless man 

be wound reward for soldier in the field 
what sell our land be these the fruit of war 
then die Philarchus let not shame survive 
thy faint honour dead and yet alive 

here come our wife how wretched they look 

my jewel pawn my ring be go to wrack 
the greedy usurer have get all 

I be a prey to wretched poverty 
ill feature famine will devour we up 
who wrinkle face be like pale death aspect 

behold my wife like winter paramour 
robe and bereave of nuptial ornament 
hide thou Philarchus lower then the grave 
the earth will cover though it can save 

if man lament who wont ironheart 
be hard than the armour they have wear 
and wail the agent of a woman voice 
what shall weak woman and poor lady do 
fall to those tear that we be bear unto 

can I but learn with Croesus to endure 
the fall sickness of sad poverty 
who lose a rich command empery 
patience will prove a tutor to my grieve 

thou want a Solon to consort with thou 
to prove affliction be the perfect way 
that lead to jove tribunal dignity 
ill haste thou govern thy prosperity 
that can not smile in mere adversity 
look upon i the poor slave in show 
that ever fortune bury in mishap 
yet this be nature rich jewelhouse 
and teach i to weep at all your want 

why thou be far more wretched than we 
how can thou teach we then tranquillity 

se thou this poor and naked bosom here 
do thou behold this scorn uncover head 
when thou be rich and peerless in thy pride 
content do never harbour in thy breast 
nor ere have love her residence in thou 
I mean the love of perfect happiness 
but skilless grudge from a haughty spirit 
do blind thy sense with a slender merit 
while I poor man not subject to such thought 
give entertain to those sweet bless babe 
which sapience bring from wisdom holy breast 
and think i rich to have their company 
by nurse they in peace I shun all sloth 
nor yet do plenty make i prodigal 
pride I abhor and term the beggar shield 
nor ever do base envy touch my heart 
yet always love to bear as Solon say 
a turtle eye within a aspic head 
nor can the rattle fury of fierce war 
astonish i more than the midnight clock 
the trumpeter to contemplation 
for poverty I shake she by the hand 
as welcome lady to this woeful land 

how may we tread the path to happy end 
since foe to learning be not virtue friend 

first entertain submission in your soul 
to frame true concord in one unity 
behold the fair proportion of a man 
who heaven have create so complete 
yet if the arm make war against the head 
or that the heart rebel against the brain 
this elemental body thus compact 
be but a scatter chaos of revenge 
your law appoint to be positive 
by war confound must be bring again 
for law be that which love and peace maintain 

thou son of knowledge rich than a man 
we censure thy advice as oracle 

follow and I will instruct you what I can 

we follow beast before but now a man 

o heaven pour highprized savour forth 
like to the honey dew that sweet the leave 
once send we peace that fair palmcrowned queen 

ruin and war the precedent of wrath 
that crope the fifty son of Hecuba 
have rid their circuit through this fertile soil 
and quite transform it to a wilderness 

Come let we sit and mourn with sad lament 
the heavy burden of our discontent 

to wail our want let speak slack the pain 
for word of grief divide the grief in twain 

our shop sometime be stuff with cloth of gold 
but war have empty they and spider build 
their cobwebtent weave foul dusty lawn 
for poor woeworking poverty to wear 

o woe behold our poor distress wife 

from poverty to famine worse and worse 

the scourge of pride and heaven detest curse 

where be that excess consume upon the back 

sink down to hell while hunger feel the lack 

who now will pity we that scorn the poor 

pity be pass when peace be out of door 

drink thou my tear and I will drink up thou 
for nought but tear be misery salt wine 

we that have scorn to dress our meat ourselves 
now will be glad if we have meat to dress 

and if Lament be remedy for want 
their cate wear course that in lament be scant 

comfort sweet wife ill last not always so 
and good sometime make end of linger woe 

my grief be thou 

and i be most for thou 

my care be thou 

be mine for thou and i 

faith poverty have pay my wife on the petticoat 

from these devour worm eat man alive 
and swallow up whole manor at a bit 
the while our hungry body die for lack 
and honest husbandry must go to wrack 

pray sir for peace that best may please we all 
from city pride the country take his fall 

it be time for ploughshare now be turn to bill 
carthorse press to carry cavalier 
true labour servant count soldier slave 

though famine hungerstarve yet heaven save 

then let we pray to heaven all for peace 
for thence come comfort plenty and increase
