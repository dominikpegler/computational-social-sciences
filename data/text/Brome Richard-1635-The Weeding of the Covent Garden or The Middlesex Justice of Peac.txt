I have lay open my heart to you which indeed be he but your father I fear will never be win 

why you will not have he too sister will you 

his consent I will and my father I hope will easy be wrought you see he be willing your other brother shall have i at the first sight mere for his reservedness and mihil methinks carry himself as civil today as he I mean as civil for a gentleman that shall not look like one father of the dutch church at five and twenty 

he be put to it today the noise of the tavern have almost wrought his zeal into fury it be scarce out of my head yet 

but you be about to tell i how he first fall into this vein this vanity indeed 

I will tell you now and in that something worth your observation 

I will observe you 

my father have a humour not to like any thing at first nor accept best courtesy of friend though present he find they most commodious to he thing that he know not how to be without and oftentimes desire with the same breath the thing he vilify and scorn they the last syllable he speak before you see when your father offer he the use of his house here till his own be furnish he cry hah ha be all the house in the town you sir and yet present entreat for it and thank he 

that show the best nature they say 

but that be seldom attend by the best fortune nay in we I mean his child he will like nothing no not those action which he himself can deny be virtuous he will cross we in all we do as if there be no other way to show his power over our obedience 

it be a strange fatherly care 

now note the punishment that follow it there be not a child he have though we all know what we do that make any conscience of cross he we have so much of his good nature in we 

and that be as odd a duty in child 

I must confess it be a stubbornness 
yet for the most part we do nothing but that which most parent will allow in their child and now for my brother Gabriel with who I must bring in the story of another kinswoman of we my father have at home with we 

So 

nay mark I pray you as I will entreat a auditory if I now be a poet to mark the plot and several point of my play that they may not say when it be do they understand not this or that or how such a part come in or go out because they do not observe the passage 

well on I pray 

my brother Gabriel when he be a boy nay till within these two year be the wild untamed thing that the country can possible hold 

so he be still for aught I know for I think no man of his religion in his wit 

I mean in outward conversation he be the ringleader of all the youthful fry to fair to wake to maygame footballmatch any thing that have but noise and tumult in it than he be captain of the young trainband and exercise the youth of twenty parish in martial discipline o he do love to imitate a soldier the best and so in every thing that there be not a handsome maid in a whole county can be quiet for he 

he may be good at that sport still for there be almost none of his sect hold any other game lawful 

yet do he bear the civil and the best order affection to our kinswoman I speak of 

yes I remember 

So love to her person so tender of her honour that nothing but too near affinity of blood can have keep they asunder 

and she do love he as well 

O dear virtuous well but my father fear what youth in heat of blood may do remove my brother Gabriel from home into the service of a reverend bishop to follow good example 

but he learn not to be a Puritan there I hope 

you shall hear sister soon after come a gallant into the country from London here and as we after find a citizen son though he show like a lord there brief he grow acquaint with my brother mihil then woo and win my cousin so secret my father never suspect nor he nor I ever know who son he be nor of what occupation my old lord his father be but he promise her marriage clape she you may guess where and so like the slippery trojan leave she 

o devilish rascal 

and foolish creature she who soon repent it and with her shame be flee to what part of the world we know not 

in truth it be pitiful that villain will be hang 

now upon this my poor brother that love she so fall into discontent forsake his lord and will have leave the land but that he be prevent and bring home 

and ever since he have be thus religious 

thus obstinate for I think very he do it but to cross my father for send he out of the way when the mischief be do 

I will not then believe it be religion in any of the gang of they but mere wilful affectation but why or wherein do you or mihil across your father 

I tell you sister we must he be so cross himself that we shall never get any thing of he that we desire but by desire the contrary 

why then do you desire he to get you a husband 

because he shall get i none o sister both he and mr cockbrayne can wish now that I have have his son 

there be another youth now go on love pilgrimage ever since your father cross he in your love not to be hear of
