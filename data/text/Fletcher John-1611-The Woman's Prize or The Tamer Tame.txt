spirit and plume will make a hundred check 
to show her freedom sail in every air

for such a wife now 

full as many prayer 
as the most zealous Puritan conceive 
out of the meditation of fat veal 
or bird of prey cram capon against player 
and to as good a tune too but against she 
that heaven will bless i from she mark it Pedro 
if this house be not turn within this fortnight 
with the foundation upward I will be cart 
my comfort be yet that those amority 
that come to back her cause those heathen whore have 
their hood hallow with sack 

how devilish drink they be 

and how they tumble Pedro do thou mark 
the country Cavaliero 

out upon she 
how she turn down the bagget 

I that sink she 

that drink be well put to she what a sober salt 
when the chair fall she fetch with her heel upward 

and what a piece of landscape she discover 

do mark she when her hood fall in the posset 

yes and there rid like a dutch hoy the tumbril 
when she have get her ballast 

that I see too 

how fain she will have draw on Sophocles 
to come aboard and how she simper it 

I warrant she she have be a worthy striker 

in the heat of summer there have be some hope on it 

hang she 

she offer he a harrygroat and belch out

upon my life have give he twenty stool since

and so much that I sweat for it so I do 
but to no end I wash a Aethiop 
she swear my force may weary she but win she 
I never can nor shall till she consent 
and I may take her body prisoner

if I be so dispose she can not help it 
but there be one call jaques a poor butler 
one that may well content a single woman 

and he shall tilt she 

to that sense and last 
she bid i yet these six night look for nothing 
nor strive to purchase it but fair good night 
and so good morrow and a kiss or two 
to close my stomach for her vow have seal it 
and she will keep it constant 

stay you stay you 
be she thus when you woo she
