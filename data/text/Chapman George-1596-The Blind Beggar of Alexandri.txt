leave I a while my lord and wait for i 
at the black fountain by Osiris grove 
I will walk alone to holy Irus cave 
talk a little while with he and then return 
Ianthe begone 
now Irus let thy mind eternal eye 
extend the virtue of it past the sun 
ah my Cleanthes where be thou become 
but since I save thy guiltless life from death 
and turn it only into banishment 
forgive i love i pity comfort i 

master 

Pego 

wipe your eye and you have they 

why Pego 

the queen be here to see your blindness 

her majesty be well come heaven preserve 
and send her highness a immortal rain 

thank reverent Irus for thy gentle prayer 
dismiss thy man a while and I will lead thou 
for I have weighty secret to impart 

will I be blind that she may lead i 

Irus thy skill to tell the drift of fate 
our fortune and thing hide from sensual eye 
have send i to thou for advertisement 
where duke Cleanthes live that be exile 
this kingdom for attempt i with love 
and offer stain to Egypt royal bed 

I hope your majesty will pardon i 
if conscience make i utter what I think 
of that high love affair betwixt he and you 

I will sweet Iris be well assure 
that whatsoever thy sharp wisdom see 
in my sad frailty thou will have regard 
to my estate and name and keep it close 

of that your highness may be well assure 
than I be bind madam to tell you this 
that you yourself do seek Cleanthes love 
and to aspire it make away his duchess 
which he well know and affect she 
dear as his life deny to satisfy 
that kindness offer betwixt your self and he 
therefore do you in rage inform the duke 
he seek your love and so he banish he 

too true it be grave Irus thou have tell 
but for my love sake which not god can rule 
strike i no more of that wound yet too green 
but only tell i where Cleanthes be 
that I may follow he in some disguise 
and make he recompense for all his wrong 

Cleanthes be about this city off 
with who your majesty shall meet ere long 
and speak with he if you will use such mean 
as you may use for his discovery 

what shall I use then what be in my power 
I will not use for his discovery 
I will bind the wing of love unto my arm 
and like a eagle pry for her prey 
will overlook the earth round face for he 
be this sufficient 
or I will moorlike learn to swim and dive 
into the bottom of the sea for he 
least be the son of Egypt and now set 
Thetis in rage with love will ravish he 
be this sufficient 

but madam this must be the likely mean 
to seek he out and have he at your will 
let his true picture through your land be send 
oppose great reward to he that find he 
and threaten death to they that succour he 
so I will assure your grace shall meet with he ere long 

happy and bless be Irus for his skill

for which most reverent and religious man 
I give this jewel to thou rich worth 
a quintal or a hundred weight of gold 
bestow it as thou list on some good work 
for well I know thou nothing do reserve 
of all thy riches man bestow on thou 
but will thou leave this place and poor man life 
the count of Egypt shall embrace thy foot 
and topless honour be bestow on thou 

I thank your highness for thus raise i 
but in this barrenness I be most renown 
for wisdom and the sight of heavenly thing 
shine not so clear as earthly vanity 

most rich be Irus in his poverty 
o that to find his skill my crown be lose 
none but poor Irus can of riches boast 
now my Cleanthes I will straight advance 
thy lovely picture on each monument 
about the city and within the land 
propose twice five thousand crown to he 
that find he to be tender by my hand 
and a kind kiss at my imperial lip 
to he that succour he I will threaten death 
but he that do not threaten he shall die 
for who be worthy life will see he want 
to all his picture when they be disperse 
Will I continual pilgrimage make 
as to the saint and idol I adore 
where I will offer sigh and vow and tear 
and sacrifice a hecatomb of beast 
on several altar build where they be place 
by they shall Isis stature gentle stand 
and I will pretend my jealous rite to she 
but my Cleanthes shall the object be 
and I will kneel and pray to none but he 

see earth and heaven where her Cleanthes be 
I be Cleanthes and blind Irus too 
and more than these as you shall soon perceive 
yet but a shepherd son at Memphis bear 
and I will tell you how I get that name

I thank you for your good opinion sir 
but the reason of your office do upon this noble man 
and his land 

the reason why I have put in office or execution 
my authority upon this nobleman consist 
in three principal point or member 
which indeed be three goodly matter 

I pray you let we hear they 

the first be the credit of this honest man because he be rich 

why be he honest because he be rich 

o I learn that in any case the next be the forfeit of his assurance and the last I will not trouble your grace with all 

but this it be whereof I most complain unto your grace 
that have occasion in your grace service 
to borrow money of this Leon here 
for which I mortgage all my land and good 
he only do agree that pay he four 
thousand pound at the day I shall receive 
safe in which now not only false he deny my statute 
but that he have receive one penny due 
which this my friend can witness I repay de 
upon the stone of Irus the blindman 
four thousand pound in jewel and in gold 
and therefore crave I justice in this case 

vouchsafe dread sovereign a unpartial ear 
to that I have to say for my reply 
he plead the payment of four thousand pound 
upon the stone before blind Irus cave 
to which I answer and do swear by heaven 
he speak with i at the foresay place 
and promise payment of four thousand pound 
if I will let he have his statute in 
and take other assurance for another thousand 
some three month to come or thereabouts 
which I refuse he repay i none 
but part in a rage and card not for i 

o monstrous whoever hard the like 
my lord I will be swear he pay he 
on poor Irus stone four thousand pound 
which I do help to tender and have thou 
a hellish conscience and such a brazen forehead 
to deny it against my witness 
and his noble word 

sir against your witness and his noble word 
I plead my own and one as good as he 
that then be present at our whole conference 

my lord there be not any but ourselves 
but who be it that thou affirm be there 

count Hermes good my lord a man 
well know though he be humorous to be honourable 

and will he say it 

he will my gracious lord I be well assure 
and he will I send hither present 
entreat your gracious favour if the impediment 
of a late sickness cause i not return 
for I be pass ill 

well send he hither and it shall suffice 

I will my gracious lord and stand 
to any censure pass willing 
your highness shall set down or command 
worshipful master burgomaster your officer 
to see perform betwixt we 

we thank you hearty alas poor soul 
how sick he be 
Truly I can choose but pity he 
in that he love your gracious officer 

o I thank you sir 

king by your leave and yet I need not ask leave 
because I be send for if not I will begone again 
without leave say be I send for yea or no 

you be to witness betwixt Antisthenes and wealthy Leon 

I know the matter and I come from that old miser 
Leon who be sudden fall sick of a knave evil 
which of you be trouble with that disease master 

well say what you know of the matter betwixt they 

then thus I say my lord Antisthenes come 
to the stone of the blind fool Irus 
that day when four thousand pound be to be pay 
where he make proffer of so much money if Leon will return the mortgage of his land and take assurance for another thousand to be pay I trow some three month to come or there about which Leon like a old churl as he be most uncourteous refuse my lord Antisthenes as he may very well depart in a rage but if it have be to i I will have pistol he I faith 

but you be wondrous deceive my lord 
And be not by when he and we do talk 

swoon then I say you be deceive my lord 
for I be by now by my honour and by all the god 

then you stand close my lord unseen to any 

why I stand close to you and see of all and if you think I be too mad a fellow to witness such a weighty piece of work the holy beggar shall perform as much for he be by at our whole conference 

but say count Hermes be the beggar by 

I say he be and he shall say he be 

but he be now they say lock in his cave 
fast and pray talk with the god 
and have a iron door betwixt he and you 
how will you then come at he 

I will fetch he from his cave in spite of all his god and iron door or beat he blind whenas I do catch he next farewell my lord you have do with i I will send the beggar present for I be now ride to Corrucus 

I know not what to think in these affair 
I can well condemn you my lord 
and your sufficient witness be a gentleman 
nor yet the other two both man of credit 
though in his kind this count be humorous 
but stay we shall here straight what Irus will depose 

o who disturb i in my holy prayer 
o that the king be by that he may here 
what thunder there be at my far door 
o how the good of Egypt be disturb in my devotion 

I be here Irus and it be count Hermes 
that be so rude to interrupt thy prayer 
but I suppose the end of thy repair 
be so weighty can not have displease 
for on thy witness do depend the live 
of lord Antisthenes who do affirm 
that three day past he tender at thy stone 
four thousand pound to Leon and desire 
his mortgage quite which he promise 
on such assurance more as he propose 
receive at that time his four thousand pound 

I then be in the hear of they both 
but hard no penny tender only propose 
by lord Antisthenes if he will bring he in 
his mortgage and take assurance for another thousand 
some three month to come or there abouts 
which Leon most uncourteous refuse 
my lord be angry and I hear no more 
and thus must I crave pardon of your grace 

farewell grave Irus 

god be become oppressor of the right 

never have right so violent a wrong 
for let the thunder strike i into hell 
if what I have report be not true 

this holy man no doubt speak what he hear 
and I be sorry for Antisthenes 
but I will relieve your low estate my lord 
and for your service do i guerdon you 
master burgomaster let the lord have liberty 
and I will answer Leon what be due 

soft mistress burgomaster pray you stay your heart be 
great than your parson far or your state either do we not 
know you trow what woman you be but a burgomaster wife 
and he no wise than his neighbour neither 
give i the place accord to my call 

what skill for place do we not all call sister 

no by my faith I be a countess now 
I shall have one to go before i bare 
and say stand by there to the best of they 
and one to come behind and bear my train 
because my hand must not be put unto it 
my husband be a lord and past a lord 

and past a lord what be that past I pray 

why he be a what you call it 

a what you call it can you not name it 

I think I must not name it 

and why so I pray 

because it come so near a thing that I know 

o he be a count that be a earl 

and yet he be not know to have much land 

why therefore he be a unknown man 

ay but my husband be the king officer 

ay but my husband be able to buy both you 

you say husband I may say my lord 

and methinks husband be worth ten of lord 

indeed I love my lord to call i wife 
better than madam yet do I not mean 
to lose my lady title at your hand 
I may for courtesy and to be term 
a gentle lady call you sister still 
but you must say and please your ladyship 
it be thus and so and as your honour please 
yet shall my husband call i wife like you 
for why make god the husband and the wife 
but that those term shall please we more than other 
new fashion term I like not for a man 
to call his wife coney forsooth and lamb 
and pork and mutton he as well may say 

well madam then and please your ladyship 
what gown and head tire will your honour wear 

twenty be make for i head tire and gown 
head tire enchase in order like the star 
which perfect great and fine cut precious stone 
one have bright Ariadne crown in it 
even in the figure it present in heaven 
another have the finger of Diana 
and Berenice ever burn hair 
another have the bright Andromica 
with both her silver wrist bind to a rock 
and Perseus that do lose she and save her life 
all set in number and in perfect form 
even like the asterism fix in heaven 
and even as you may see in moon shine night 
the moon and star reflect on their stream 
so from my head shall you see star take beam 

o brave God willing I will have the like 

and so will I by god grace if I live 

come up to supper it will become the house wonderful well 

well if my husband will not let he not look for one good look of i 

nor i I swear 

I will ask my husband when I be with child 
and then I know I shall be speed I faith 

but every pleasure have a pain they say 
my husband lie each other night abroad 

and so do i which I like but little 

well time I hope and change of company 
will teach we somewhat to bear out the absence 

I know not what to say 
my husband make as if each other night he have occasion 
to ride from home at home serve not his turn 
to my good turn it Cupid I beseech you 

now will I try to make myself the count 
a arrant cuckold and a wittol too 

now may I chance to prove a cunning man 
and tell my mistress where my maister haunt 

bright nymph I come in name of all the world 
that now sustain dead winter in the spring 
to have a grace from thy summer dart 
thy love sweet soul be all that I desire 
to make a general summer in this heart 
where winter double wrath have tyrannize 

How dare you Leon thus solicit i 
where if the count my husband shall come now 
and see you court you be sure to die 

o but he be safe for at my house 
boot and spur and in his velvet gown 
he take his horse and ride unto Corrucus 
and therefore beauteous lady make not strange 
to take a friend and add unto thy joy 
of happy wedlock the end of every act 
be to increase contentment and renown 
both which my love shall ample joy in you 

how can renown ensue a act of shame 

no act have any shame within itself 
but in the knowledge and ascription 
of the base world from who shall this be keep 
as in a labyrinth or a brazen tower 

but virtue sole regard must hold i back 

the virtue of each thing be in the praise 
and I will rear thy praise to the sky 
out of my treasury choose the choice of gold 
till thou find some match thy hair in brightness 
but that will never be so choose thou ever 
out of my jewelry choose thy choice of diamond 
till thou find some as bright some as thy eye 
but that will never be so choose thou ever 
choose ruby out until thou match thy lip 
pearl till thy tooth and ivory till thy skin 
be match in whiteness but that will never be 
nor never shall my treasury have end 
till on there beauty lady loath to spend 
but that will never be so choose thou ever 

now what a god name will this vain man have 
do you not shame to tempt a woman thus 
I know not what to say nor what to do 
he will have i do that I fear I shall not 
some thing it be he seek that he think good 
and methinks he shall be more wise than I 
I be a foolish girl though I be marry 
and know not what to do the god do know

I and gold and diamond shall my sweet love have 

well I will not bid you sir but if you come 
at your own peril for I will wash my hand 

a plague of all sanguine simpliciti 

but do you hear sir pray you do not think that I grant you 

no I warrant you I will have no such thought in any case 
o this be old excellent 
now who can desire better sport 
this night my other wife must lie alone 
and next night this wife must do the like 
now will I woo the other as the count 
which if she grant and they do break their troth 
I will make myself a cuckold betwixt they both 

I will follow he until he take the earth and then I will leave he 

now if my husband be not all alone 
he be from home and have leave i alone 
so I must learn to lie as child go 
all alone all alone which lesson now 
I be able to bear a child be worse to i then when I be a child

mistress what will you say if I can tell you where my master be

thus have we tread the sandy vale of Egypt 
adjoin to the plain of Alexandria 
where proud king Ptolemy keep his residence 
secure trust to his prophecy 
which have foretell he many year ago 
that if the young arcadian Doricles 
shall link in marriage with his lovely daughter 
he then shall conquer all our border land 
and make we subject to his tyranny 

trust to his fond fantastic dream 
he have exile the warlike duke Cleanthes 
who name be terror to our valiant troop 

Cleanthes exile give we easy way 
to our attempt where have he stay 
and be a friend to he yet shall he not 
escape subjection 

we will divide his kingdom betwixt we four 
and reave from he his four chief ornament 
and for to grieve his age mind the more 
he shall be keep in last servitude 
so to fulfil what fate to he assign 

Come let we march and brave he at the wall 
if Porus live to wield his martial sword 
his city wall shall not preserve he safe 
but he shall die by Porus and his friend 

sweet madam grant i once a cheerful look 
to glad my die heart with sorrow kill 
your father have resign his free consent 
you bind by duty to obey his will 

nay rather let he hail i to my death 
then against my will constrain i match myself 

die thou vile wretch and live Aspasia 
even now I hear thy father Ptolemy 
with word that still do tingle in my ear 
pronounce he heir to Alexandria 
it be time for i to stir when such young boy 
shall have their weak neck over poise with crown 
which must become resolve champion 
that for a crown exchange will sell their soul he kill he 

wicked count Hermes for this monstrous deed 
Egypt will hate thou and thou sure must die 
then hie thou to the hill beyond the Alps 
fly to unknown and unfrequented clime 
some desert place that never see the sun 
for if the king or any of his friend 
shall find count Hermes thou be sure dead 

I will fly no more than do a settle rock 
no more than mountain or the steadfast pole 
but come sweet love if thou will come with i 
we two will live among the shadowy grove 
and we will sit like shepherdess on a hill 
and with our heavenly voice entice the tree 
to echo sweet to our celestial tune 
else will I angle in the run brook 
season our toil with kiss on the bank 
sometime I will dive into the murmur spring 
and fetch thou stone to hang about thy neck 
which by thy splendour will be turn to pearl 
say fair Aspasia will thou walk with i 

no bloody count but I will clear myself 
and tell thy murder to the amaze court 

nay if thou will not choose you peevish girl 
thou can not say but thou be offer fair 
but here must end count Hermes strange disguise 
my velvet gown my pistol and this patch 
no more must hide i in the count attire 
now will I turn my gown to usurer coat 
and thus appear unto the world no more 
farewell Aspasia

where never heaven light may shine on thou 
who be there come forth for here be murder do

who call out murder lady be it you 

as I be walk in the pleasant weed 
with Doricles the young arcadian prince 
rush in count Hermes and in desperate word 
have slay this prince 

a baleful deed pursue the murderer 
and tell the king of this foul accident 

o tell no more in stead of tear 
my beat heart dissolve in drop of blood 
and from my eye that stare upon this corpse 
leap out my soul and on it I will die 
o Doricles o dear Arcadian prince 
the bulwark and supporter of my life 
that by decree of fate be promise 
to add four neighbour kingdom to my crown 
and shield i from a most abhor death 
now shall my kingdom leave i with my life 
and sudden look for some monstrous fate 
shall fall like thunder on my wretched state

all which have vow the death of Ptolemy and thus they hither bend their speedy foot 

how sudden be weather over cast 
how be the face of peaceful Egypt change 
like as the smile flower above the ground 
by keen edge of Eura breath be cut

join with your power of Alexandria 
will double all the force of these king

and every bird and beast run over he 
that rob poor Ptolemy of such a hope 
pursue the desperate count that murder he 
a thousand kingdom shall not save his life 
a miracle a miracle a dreadful miracle 

what miracle o what will heaven do more 
to punish Egypt and her hapless king 

as I be walk through the sirian grove 
I see the desperate count the murderer 
of good prince Doricles as I hear say 
fly through the desert to the mimphick shade 
where hell to interrupt his passage thither
