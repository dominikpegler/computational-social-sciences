I have no mercy of these infidel 
since I be put in mind on it good bear with i 
can no man fit you I will find he out 

this summer fruit that you call courtier 
while you continue cold and frosty to he 
hang fast and may be find but when you fling 
too full a heat of your affection 
upon his root and make he ripe too soon 
you will find he rot in the the handle 
his oath and affection be all one 
with his apparel thing to set he off 
he have as many mistress as faith 
and all apocrypha his true belief 
be only in a private surgeon 
and for my single self I will soon venture 
a new conversion of the Indies 
then to make courtier able man or honest 

I do believe you love no courtier 
and by my troth to guess you into love 
with any I can think of be beyond 
either your will or my imagination 
and yet I be sure you be catch and I will know he 
there be none leave now worthy the think of 
unless it be a soldier and I be sure 
I will ever bless myself from such a fellow

and not the love of truth I will lay my life 
if God have make thou man thou have be a coward 

if to be valiant be to be a soldier I will tell you true

this heresy must be look too in time for if it spread 
it will grow too pestilent be I a scholar 
I will so hamper thou for thy opinion

seigneur what think you of this sound of war 

as only of a sound they that intend 
to do be like deep water that run quiet 
leave no face of what they be behind they 
this rumour be too common and too loud 
to carry truth 

shall we never live to see 
man look like man again 
upon a march 
this cold dull rusty peace make we appear 
like empty picture only the faint shadow 
of what we shall be 
will to God my mother 
have give but half her will to my beget 
and make i woman to sit still and sing 
or be sick when I list or any thing 
that be too idle for a man to think of 
will I have be a whore it have be a course 
certain and of my conscience of more gain 
than two command as I will handle it 
faith I can wish I have be any thing 
rather than what I be a soldier 
a career or a cobbler when I know 
what it be to wear a sword first for their trade 
be and shall be a constant way of life 
while man send cheese up or wear out buskin 

thou be a little too impatient 
and make thy anger a far more vexation 
than the not have war I be a soldier 
which be my whole inheritance yet I 
though I can wish a breach with all the world 
if not dishonourable I be not so malicious 
to curse the fair peace of my mother country 
but thou want money and the first supply 
will bury these thought in thou 

pox a peace 
it fill the kingdom full of holiday 
and only feed the want of whore and piper 
and make the idle drunken rogue get spinster 
it be true I may want money and no little 
and almost clothes too of which if I have both 
in full abundance yet against all peace 
that bring up mischief thick than a shower 
I will speak loud than a lawyer 
by heaven it be the surfeit of all youth 
that make the toughness and the strength of nation 
melt into woman it be a ease that brood 
thief and bastard only 

this be more 
though it be true then we ought to lay open 
and season only of a indiscretion 
believe i captain such distemper spirit 
once out of motion though they be proof valiant 
if they appear thus violent and fiery 
breed but their own disgrace and be near 
doubt and suspect in prince than reward 

it be well they can be near they any way 
but call you those true spirit ill affect 
that while the war be serve like wall and rib 
to girdle in the kingdom 
and now fall 
through a faint peace into affliction 
speak but their misery come come Fabritio 
you may pretend what patience you please 
and seem to yoke your want like passion 
but while I know thou be a soldier 
and a deserver and no other harvest 
but what thy sword reap for thou to come in 
you shall be please to give i leave to tell you 
you wish a devil of this musty peace 
to which prayer 
as one that be bind in conscience and all 
that love our trade I cry amen 

prithee no more we shall live well enough 
there be way enough beside the war to man 
that be not log and lie still for the hand 
of other to remove they 

you may thrive sir 
thou be young and handsome yet and well enough 
to please a widow thou can sing and tell 
these foolish lovetale and indite a little 
and if need be compile a pretty matter 
and dedicate it to the honourable 
which may awaken his compassion 
to make you clerk of the kitchen and at length 
come to be marry to my lady woman 
after she be crack in the ring 

it be very well sir 

but what do thou think shall become of i 
with all my imperfection let i die 
if I think I shall ever reach above 
a forlorn tapster or some frothy fellow 
that stink of stale beer 

captain Jacamo 
why shall you think so hardly of your virtue 

what virtue by this light I have no virtue 
but down right buffet what can my face 
that be no better than a ragged map now 
of where I have march and travel profit i 
unless it be for lady to abuse and say 
it be spoil for want of a Bongrace when I be young 
and now it will make a true prognostication 
of what man must be tell i of a fellow 
that can mend nose and complain 
so tall a soldier shall want tooth to his stomach 
and how it be great pity that it be 
that he that make my body be so busy 
he can not stay to make my leg too but be drive 
to clap a pair of catskin to my knee for which 
I be indebt to two schoolboy this 
must follow necessary 

there be no such matter 

then for my moral and those hide piece 
that art bestow upon i they be such 
that when they come to light I be sure will shame i 
for I can neither write nor read nor speak 
that any man shall hope to profit by i 
and for my language they be so many 
that put they altogether they will scarce 
serve to beg single beer in the plain truth be 
I love a soldier and can lead he on 
and if he fight well I dare make he drink 
this be my virtue and if this will do 
I will scramble yet among they 

it be your way 
to be thus pleasant still but fear not man 
for though the war fail we shall screw ourselves 
into some course of life yet 

good Fabritio 
have a quick eye upon i for I fear 
this peace will make i something that I love not 
for by my troth though I be plain and dudgeon 
I will not be a ass and to sell parcel 
I can as soon be hang prithee bestow i 
and speak some little good though I deserve not 

Come we will consider more stay this 
shall be another windfall of the war 

he look indeed like a old tatter colour 
that every wind will borrow from the staff 
these be the hope we have for all our hurt 
they have not cast his tongue too 

they that say 
hope never leave a wretched man that seek she 
I think be either patient fool or liar 
I be sure I find it so for I be master 
with such a misery and grief together 
that that stay anchor man lay hold upon 
in all their need be to i lead that bow 
or break with every strong sea of my sorrow 
I can now question heaven be it well 
to look into their justice why those fault 
those heavy sin other provoke they with 
shall be reward on the head of we 
that hold the least alliance to their vice 
but this will be too curious for I see 
our suffering not dispute be the end 
reveal to we of all these misery 

Twenty such holy hermit in a camp 
will make they all carthusian I will be hang 
if he know what a whore be or a health 
or have a nature liable to learn 
or so much honest nurture to be drink 
I do not think he have the spleen to swear 
a great oath than sempster utter sock with 
s'pur he a question 

they be stranger both 
to i as I to they I hope I will not have 
i and my shame together know by any 
I will rather lie myself unto another 

I need not ask you sir your country 
I hear you speak this tongue pray what more be you 
or have you be if it be not offensive 
to urge you so far misery in your year 
give every thing a tongue to question it 

sir though I can be please to make my ill 
only i own for grieve other man 
yet to so fair and courteous a demander 
that promise compassion at worst pity 
I will relate a little of my story 
I be a gentleman however thus 
poor and unhappy which believe i sir 
be not bear with i for I well have try 
both the extreme of fortune and have find 
both dangerous my young year provoke i 
feel in what a case I sleep at home 
which to all stir spirit be a sickness 
to see far country and observe their custom 
I do so and I travel till that course 
store i with language and some few slight manner 
scarce worth my money when an i possess i 
of make arm my active end of travel 

but do you so 

I do and twenty winter 
I wear the christian cause upon my sword 
against his enemy at Buda siege 
full many a cold night have I lodge in armour 
when all be freeze in i but my honour 
and many a day when both the sun and canon 
strive who shall most destroy we have I stand 
mall up in steel when my rough sinew shrink 
and this parch body ready to consume 
as soon to ash as the pike I bear 
want have be to i as another nature 
which make i with this patience still profess it 
and if a soldier may without vainglory 
tell what he have do believe i gentleman 
I can turn over annal of my danger 
with this poor weakness have I man a breach 
and make it firm with so much blood that all 
I have to bring i off alive be anger 
thrice be I make a slave and thrice redeem 
at price of all I have the misery 
of which time if I have a heart to tell 
will make you weep like child but I will spare you 

Fabricio we two have be soldier 
above these fourteen year yet of my conscience 
all we have see compare to his experience 
have be but cudgelplay or cockfighting 
by all the faith I have in arm I reverence 
the very poverty of this brave fellow 
which be enough itself and he to strengthen 
the weak town against half Christendom 
I be never so ashamed of service 
in all my life before now I consider 
what I have do and yet the rogue will swear 
I be a valiant fellow I do find 
the great danger I have bring my life through 
now I have hear this worthy be no more 
than steal of a maypole or at worst 
fight at single billet with a bargeman 

I do believe he Jacamo 

believe he 
I have no faith within i if I do not 

I see they be soldier 
and if we may judge by affection 
brave and deserve man how they be stir 
but with a mere relation of what may be 
since I have win belief and be not know 
forgive i honour I will make use of thou 

sir will I be a man or great or able 
to look with liberal eye upon your virtue 

let we give he all we have and leave off prate 
here soldier there be even five month pay be merry 
and get thou handsome clothes 

what mean you Jacamo 

you be a fool 
the very story be worth a hundred pound 
give he more money 

gentleman I know not 
how I be able to deserve this blessing 
but if I live to see fair day again 
something I will do in honour of your goodness 
that shall show thankfulness if not desert 

if you please sir till we procure you place 
to eat with we or wear such honest garment 
as our poor mean can reach to you shall be 
a welcome man to say more be to feed you 
only with word we honour what you have be 
for we be soldier though not near the worth 
you speak of late 

I do guess you so 
and know unless he be a soldier 
he can not find the way to know my want 

but methinks all this while you be too temperate 
do you not tell man sometime of their dulness 
when you be grip as now you be with need 
I do and let they know those silk they wear 
the war weave for they and the bread they eat 
we sow and reap again to feed their hunger 
I tell they bold they be master of 
nothing but what we fight for their fair woman 
lie play in their arm while we like lares 
defend their pleasure I be angry too 
and often rail at these forgetful great man 
that suffer we to sue for what we ought 
to have fling on we ere we ask 

I have 
too often tell my grief that way when all 
I reap be rudeness of behaviour 
in their opinion man of war that thrive 
must thank they when they rail and wait to live 

Come sir I see your want need more relieve 
then look what they be pray go with we 

I thank you gentleman since you be please 
to do a benefit I dare not cross it 
and what my service or endeavour may 
stand you in need you shall command not pray 

so you shall we I will to the tailor with you bodily exeunt 

well if this be true I will believe a woman 
when I have nothing else to do 

it be certain if there be a way of truth 
in blush smile and commendation 
for by this light have hear her praise you fellow 
in such a pitch as if she have study 
to crowd the worth of all man into he 
and I imagine these be seldom use 
without their special end and by a maid 
of her desire and youth 

it may be so 
she be free as you or I be and may have 
by that prerogative a liberal choice 
in the bestow of her love 

bestow 
if it be so she have bestow herself 
upon a trim youth Piso what do you call he 

why captain Jacamo 

o captain jackboy 
that be the gentleman 

I think he be 
a gentleman at worst 

so think I too 
will he will mend sir 

and a tall one too 

yes of his tooth for of my faith I think 
they be sharp than his sword and dare do more 
if the beuffe meet he fair 

very well 

now do I wonder what she mean to do 
when she have marry he 

why well enough 
trail his pike under he and be a gentlewoman 
of the brave captain company 

do you hear i 
this woman be my sister gentleman 

I be glad she be none of i but Frederick 
thou be not such a fool sure to be angry 
unless it be with she we be thy friend man 

I think you be 

yes faith and do but tell thou 
how she will utter overthrow her credit 
if she continue grace of this potgun 

I think she be bewitch or mad or blind 
she will never have take such a scarecrow else 
into protection of my life he look 
of a more rusty swarth complexion 
then a old arm doublet 

I will send 
his face to the cutler then and have it sanguine 
it will look a great deal sweet then his nose 
I will have short and my reason be 
his face will be ill mount else 

for his body 
I will not be my own judge lest I seem 
a railer but let other look upon it 
and if they find it any other thing 
than a trunkseller to send wine down in 
or a long walkingbottle I will be hang for it 
his hide for sure he be a beast be rank 
than the Muscovy leather and grain like it 
and by all likelihood he be beget 
between a stubborn pair of winter boot 
his body go with strap he be so churlish 

he be poor and beggarly beside all this 
and of a nature far uncapable 
of any benefit for his manner can 
show he a way to thank a man that do one 
he be so uncivil you may do a part 
worthy a brother to persuade your sister 
from her undo if she prove so foolish 
to marry this cast captain look to find she 
within a month where you or any good man 
will blush to know she sell cheese and prune 
and retail bottle ale I grieve to think 
because I love she what a march this captain 
will set she into 

you be both believe i 
two arrant knave and be it not for take 
so just a execution from his hand 
you have belie thus I will swaddle you 
till I can draw off both your skin like scabbard 
that man that you wrong thus though to i 
he be a stranger yet I know so worthy 
however low in fortune that his worst part 
the very wear of his clothes will make 
two better gentleman than you dare be 
for there be virtue in his outward thing 

belike you love he then 

yes marry do I 

and will be angry for he 

if you talk 
or pull your face into a stitch again 
as I love truth I shall be very angry 
do not I know thou though thou have some land 
to set thou out thus among gentleman 
to be a prate and vainglorious ass 
I do not wrong thou now for I speak truth 
do not I know thou have be a cudgel coward 
that have no cure for shame but cloth of silver 
and think the wear of a gawdy suit 
hide all disgrace 

I understand you not you hurt not i 
your anger fly so wide 

signior Frederick 
you much mistake this gentleman 

no sir 

if you will please to be less angry 
I will tell you how

or I shall tell you once again

to make you understand your sister danger

I may if it please i stand still and hear 
my sister make a maygame may I not 
and give allowance to your liberal jest 
upon his person who least anger will 
consume a legion of such wretched people 
that have no more to justify their action 
but their tongue end that dare lie every way 
as a mill grind from this hour I renounce 
all part of fellowship that may hereafter 
make i take knowledge of you but for knave 
and take heed as you love whole skin and coxcomb

even to a quarrel he be so much distrustful 
of all that take occasion to commend he

all conversation with they and believe

have her sin before i I dare see she 
be she as catch as the plague and deadly 
and tell she she be foul than all those 
and far more pestilent if not repentant 
and like a strong man chide she well and leave she 

it be easy say of what complexion be she 

make but a curious frame unto thyself 
as thou will shape a angel in thy thought 
such as the poet when their fancy sweat 
imagine Juno be or fair eye Pallas 
and one more excellent than all those figure 
shall thou find she she be brown but of a sweetness 
if such a poor word may express her beauty 
believe i Angilo will do more mischief 
with a force smile than twenty thousand Cupid 
with their love quiver full of lady eye 
and twice as many flame can fling upon we 

of what age be she 

as a rose at fair 
neither a bud nor blow but such a one 
be there a Hercules to get again 
with all his glory or one more than he 
the god will choose out among a race of woman 
to make a mother of she be outward 
all that bewitch sense all that entice 
nor be it in our virtue to uncharm it 
and when she speak o Angilo than music 
such as old Orpheus make that give a soul 
to age mountain and make rugged beast 
lay by their rage and tall tree that know 
no sound but tempest to bow down their branch 
and hear and wonder and the sea who surge 
shake their white head in heaven to be as midnight 
still and attentive steal into our soul 
so sudden and strange that we be 
from that time no more we but what she please 

why look how far you have thrust yourself again 
into your old disease be you that man 
with such a resolution that will venture 
to take your leave of folly and now melt 
even in repeat she

to see how pretty thy fear become thou 
be thou not strong enough to see a woman 

yes twenty thousand but not such a one 
as you have make she I will not lie for the matter 
I know I be frail and may be cozen too 
by such a Siren 

faith thou shall go Angilo 

faith but I will not no I know how far sir 
I be able to hold out and will not venture 
above my depth I do not long to have 
my sleep take from i and go pule 
like a poor wench have lose her market money 
and when I see good meat sit still and sigh 
and call for small beer and consume my wit 
in make anagram and faithful pose 
I do not like that itch I be sure I have rather 
have the main pox and safe 

thou shall go 
I must needs have thou as a witness with i 
of my repentance as thou love i go 

well I will go since you will have it so 
but if I prove a fool too look to have i 
curse you continual and fearful 

and if thou see i fall again good Angilo 
give i thy council quick lest I perish 

pray God I have enough to save myself 
for as I have a soul I have rather venture 
upon a savage island than this woman exeunt

for we to lie together if you have 
a arrow of the same tree with your bow
