when this eternal substance of my soul 
do live imprison in my wanton flesh 
each in their function serve other need 
I be a courtier in the spanish court 
my name be don Andrea my descent 
though not ignoble yet inferior far 
to gracious fortune of my tender youth 
for there in prime and pride of all my year 
by duteous service and deserve love 
in secret I possess a worthy dame 
which hight sweet Belimperia by name 
but in the harvest of my summer joy 
death winter nip the blossom of my bliss 
force divorce betwixt my love and i 
for in the late conflict with Portugal 
my valour draw i into danger mouth 
till life to death make passage through my wound 
when I be slay my soul descend straight 
to pass the flow stream of Acheron 
but churlish Charon only boatman there 
say that my rite of burial not perform 
I may not sit among his passenger 
ere Sol have sleep three night in Thetis lap 
and slake his smoke chariot in her cloud 
by don Horatio our knight marshal son 
my funeral and obsequy be do 
then be the ferryman of hell content 
to pass i over to the slimy strand 
that lead to fell Avernus ugly wave 
there please Cerberus with honey speech 
I pass the peril of the foremost porch 
not far from hence amid ten thousand soul 
sit Minos Aeacus and Rhadamant 
to who no soon begin I make approach 
to crave a passport for my wander ghost 
but Minos engrave leaf of lottery 
draw forth the manner of my life and death 
this knight quoth he both live and die in love 
and for his love try fortune of the war 
and by war fortune lose both love and life 
why then say Aeacus convey he hence 
to walk with lover in our field of love 
and spend the course of everlasting time 
under green myrtle tree and cypress shade 
no no say Rhadamant it be not well 
with love soul to place a martialist 
he die in war and must to martial field 
where wound Hector live in last pain 
and Achilles Myrmidon do scour the plain 
then Minos mild censor of the three 
make this device to end the difference 
Send he quoth he to our infernal king 
to doom he as best seem his majesty 
to this effect my passport straight be draw 
in keep on my way to Pluto court 
through dreadful shade of ever gloom night 
I see more sight than thousand tongue can tell 
or pen can write or mortal heart can think 
three way there be that on the right hand side 
be ready way unto the foresay field 
where lover live and bloody martialist 
but either sort contain within his bound 
the left hand path decline fearful 
be ready downfall to the deep hell 
where bloody fury shake their whip of steel 
and poor Ixion turn a endless wheel 
where usurer be choke with melt gold 
and wanton be embrace with ugly snake 
and murderer groan with never kill wound 
and perjure wight scald in boil lead 
and all soul sin with torment overwhelm 
betwixt these two way I trod the middle path 
which bring i to the fair elysian green 
in midst whereof there stand a stately tower 
the wall of brass the gate of adamant 
here find Pluto with his Proserpina 
I show my passport humble on my knee 
whereat fair Proserpina begin to smile 
and beg that only she may give my doom 
pluto be please and seal it with a kiss 
forthwith revenge she round thou in the ear 
and bid thou lead i through the gate of Hor 
where dream have passage in the silent night 
no soon have she speak but we be here 
I wot not how in twinkle of a eye 

then know Andrea that thou be arrive 
where thou shall see the author of thy death 
don Balthasar the prince of Portugal 
deprive of life by Belimperia 
here sit we down to see the mystery 
and serve for chorus in this tragedy 

now say L general how fare our camp 

all well my sovereign liege except some few 
that be decease by fortune of the war 

but what portend thy cheerful countenance 
and post to our presence thus in haste 
speak man have fortune give we victory 

victory my liege and that with little loss 

our Portugese will pay we tribute then 

tribute and wont homage therewithal 

then bless be heaven and guider of the heaven 
from who fair influence such justice flow 

o multum dilecte deo tibs militat aether 
et conivratae curvato poplito gentes 
succumbunt rectiseror est victoria iuris 

thank to my love brother of Castille 
but general unfold in brief discourse 
your form of battle and your war success 
that add all the pleasure of thy news 
unto the height of former happiness 
with deep wage and great dignity 
we may reward thy blissful chivalry 

where Spain and Portugal do joint knit 
their frontier lean on each other bind 
there meet our army in their proud array 
both furnish well both full of hope and fear 
both menace alike with dare show 
both vaunt sundry colour of device 
both cheerly sound trumpet drum and fife 
both raise dreadful clamour to the sky 
that valley hill and river make rebound 
and heaven itself be fright with the sound 
our battle both be pitch in squadron form 
each corner strong fence with wing of shot 
but ere we join and come to push of pike 
I bring a squadron of our ready shot 
from out our rearward to begin the fight 
they bring another wing to encounter we 
meanwhile our ordinance play on either side 
and captain strive to have their valour try 
don Pedro their chief horse mens colonel 
do with his cornet brave make attempt 
to break the order of our battle rank 
but don Rogero worthy man of war 
march forth against he with our musketeer 
and stop the malice of his fell approach 
while they maintain hot skirmish too and fro 
both battle join and fall to handy blow 
their violent shot resemble the ocean rage 
when roar loud and with a swell tide 
it beat upon the rampire of huge rock 
and gape to swallow neighbour bound land 
now while Bellona rage here and there 
thick storm of bullet run like winter hail 
and shiver lance dark the trouble air 
pede pes & cuspide cuspis 
anni sonant annis vir petiturque viro 
on every side drop captain to the ground 
and soldier some ill maim some slay outright 
here fall a body sunder from his head 
there leg and arm lie bleed on the grass 
mingle with weapon and unbowel steed 
that scatter over spread the purple plain 
in all this turmoil three long hour and more 
the victory to neither part incline 
till don Andrea with his brave lancier 
in their main battle make so great a breach 
that half dismay the multitude retire 
but Balthasar the Portugal young prince 
bring rescue and encourage they to stay 
herehence the fight be eager renew 
and in that conflict be Andrea slay 
brave man at arm but weak to Balthasar 
yet while the prince insult over he 
breathe out proud vaunt sound to our reproach 
friendship and hardy valour join in one 
prick forth Horatio our knight marshal son 
to challenge forth that prince in single fight 
not long between these twain the fight endure 
but straight the prince be beat from his horse 
and force to yield he prisoner to his foe 
when he be take all the rest they flee 
and our carbine pursue they to the death 
till Phoebus wave to the western deep 
our trumpeter be charge to sound retreat 

thank good L general for these good news 
and for some argument of more to come 
take this and wear it for thy sovereign sake 
but tell i now have thou confirm a peace 

no peace my liege but peace conditional 
that if with homage tribute be well pay 
the fury of your force will be stay 
and to this peace their viceroy have subscribe 
And make a solemn vow that during life 
his tribute shall be true pay to Spain 

these word these deed become thy person well 
but now knight Marshall frolic with thy king 
for it be thy son that win this battle prize 

long may he live to serve my sovereign liege 
and soon decay unless he serve my liege 

not thou nor he shall die without reward 
what mean this warning of this trumpet sound 

This tell i that your grace man of war 
such as war fortune have reserve from death 
come march on towards your royal seat 
to show themselves before your majesty 
for so I give in charge at my depart 
whereby by demonstration shall appear 
that all except three hundred or few more 
be safe return and by their foe enrich 

a gladsome sight I long to see they here 
they enter and pass by 
be that the warlike prince of Portugal 
that by our nephew be in triumph lead 

it be my liege the prince of Portugal 

but what be he that on the other side 
hold he by the arm as partner of the prize 

that be my son my gracious sovereign 
of who though from his tender infancy 
my love thought do never hope but well 
he never please his father eye till now 
nor fill my heart with overcloying joy 

go let they march once more about these wall 
that stay they we may confer and talk 
with our brave prisoner and his double guard 
Hieronimo it great please we 
that in our victory thou have a share 
by virtue of thy worthy son exploit 
bring hither the young prince of Portugal 
the rest march on but ere they be dismiss 
we will bestow on every soldier two ducat 
and on every leader ten that they may know 
our largesse welcome they 
welcome don Balthasar welcome nephew 
and thou Horatio thou be welcome too 
young prince although thy father hard misdeed 
in keep back the tribute that he owe 
deserve but evil measure at our hand 
yet shall thou know that Spain be honourable 

the trespass that my father make in peace 
be now control by fortune of the war 
and card once deal it boot not ask why so 
his man be slay a weaken to his realm 
his colour cease a blot unto his name 
his son distress a corrosive to his heart 
these punishment may clear his late offence 

i Balthasar if he observe this truce 
our peace will grow the strong for these war 
meanwhile live thou though not in liberty 
yet free from bear any servile yoke 
for in our hear thy desert be great 
and in our sight thyself be gracious 

and I shall study to deserve this grace 

but tell i for their hold make i doubt 
to which of these twain art thou prisoner 

to i my liege 

to i my sovereign 

this hand first take his courser by the reins 

but first my lance do put he from his horse 

seize his weapon and enjoy it first 

but first I force he lay his weapon down 

let go his arm upon our privilege 
say worthy prince to whether do thou yield 

to he in courtesy to this perforce 
he speak i fair this other give i stroke 
he promise life this other threaten death 
he win my love this other conquer i 
and truth to say I yield myself to both 

but that I know your grace for just and wise 
and may seem partial in this difference 
enforce by nature and by law of arm 
my tongue shall plead for young Horatio right 
he hunt well that be a lion death 
not he that in a garment wear his skin 
so hare may pull dead lion by the beard 

content thou marshal thou shall have no wrong 
and for thy sake thy son shall want no right 
will both abide the censure of my doom 

I crave no better than your grace award 

nor I although I sit beside my right 

then by my judgement thus your strife shall end 
you both deserve and both shall have reward 
nephew thou take his weapon and his horse 
his weapon and his horse be thy reward 
Horatio thou do force he first to yield 
his ransom therefore be thy valour fee 
appoint the sum as you shall both agree 
but nephew thou shall have the prince in guard 
for thy estate best fit such a guest 
Horatio house be small for all his train 
yet in regard thy substance pass he 
and that just guerdon may befall desert 
to he we yield the armour of the prince 
how like don Balthasar of this device 

right well my liege if this proviso be 
that don Horatio bear we company 
who I admire and love for chivalry 

Horatio leave he not that love thou so 
now let we hence to see our soldier pay 
and feast our prisoner as our friendly guest 

be our ambassador dispatch for Spain 

two day my liege be pass since his depart 

and tribute payment go along with he 

I my good lord 

then rest we here a while in our unrest 
and feed our sorrow with some inward sigh 
for deep care break never into tear 
but wherefore sit I in a regal throne 
this better fit a wretch endless moan 
yet this be high than my fortune reach 
and therefore better than my state deserve 
ay ay this earth image of melancholy 
seek he who fate adjudge to misery 
here let i lie now be I at the low 
qvi iacet in terranon habet unde cadat 
in i consumpsit vires fortunanocendo 
nil superest ut iam possit obesse magis 
yes fortune may bereave i of my crown 
here take it now let fortune do her worst 
she will not rob i of this sable weed 
oh no she envy none but pleasant thing 
such be the folly of despiteful chance 
fortune be blind and see not my desert 
so be she deaf and hear not my lament 
and can she hear yet be she wilful mad 
and therefore will not pity my distress 
suppose that she can pity i what then 
what help can be expect at her hand 
who foot stand on a roll stone 
and mind more mutable than fickle wind 
why wail I then where be hope of no redress 
o yes complain make my grief seem less 
my late ambition have distain my faith 
my breach of faith occasion bloody war 
those bloody war have spend my treasure 
and with my treasure my people blood 
and with their blood my joy and best belove 
my best belove my sweet and only son 
o wherefore go I not to war myself 
the cause be i I may have die for both 
my year be mellow he but young and green 
my death be natural but he be force 

no doubt my liege but still the prince survive 

survive I where 

in Spain a prisoner by mischance of war 

then they have slay he for his father fault 

that be a breach to common law of arm 

they reck no law that meditate revenge 

his ransom worth will stay from foul revenge 

no if he live the news will soon be here 

nay evil news fly fast still than good 

tell i no more of news for he be dead 

my sovereign pardon the author of ill news 
and I will bewray the fortune of thy son 

speak on I will guerdon thou whatever it be 
my ear be ready to receive ill news 
my heart grow hard against mischief battery 
stand up I say and tell thy tale at large 

then hear that truth which these my eye have see 
when both the army be in battle join 
don Balthasar amid the thick troop 
to win renown do wondrous feat of arm 
among the rest I see he hand to hand 
in single fight with their lord general 
till Alexandro that here counterfeit 
under the colour of a duteous friend 
discharge his pistol at the prince back 
as though he will have slay their general 
but therewithal don Balthasar fall down 
and when he fall then we begin to fly 
but have he live the day have sure be we 

o wicked forgery oh traitorous miscreant 

hold thou thy peace but now Villuppo say 
where then become the carcase of my son 

I see they drag it to the spanish tent 

ay ay my nightly dream have tell i this 
thou false unkind unthankful traitorous beast 
wherein have Balthasar offend thou 
that thou shall thus betray he to our foe 
be spanish gold that blear so thy eye 
that thou can see no part of our desert 
perchance because thou be Tersera lord 
thou have some hope to wear this diadem 
if first my son and then myself be slay 
but thy ambitious thought shall break thy neck 
ay this be it that make thou spill his blood 
but I will now wear it till thy blood be spill 

vouchsafe dread sovereign to hear i speak 

a way with he his sight be second hell 
keep he till we determine of his death 
if Balthasar be dead he shall not live 
Villuppo follow we for thy reward 

thus have I with a envious forge tale 
deceive the king betray my enemy 
and hope for guerdon of my villainy 

signior Horatio this be the place and hour 
wherein I must entreat thou to relate 
the circumstance of don Andrea death 
who live be my garland sweet flower 
and in his death have bury my delight 

for love of he and service to yourself 
I will refuse this heavy doleful charge 
yet tear and sigh I fear will hinder i 
when both our army be enjoin in fight 
your worthy chevalier amid the thick 
for glorious cause still aim at the fair 
be at the last by young don Balthasar 
encounter hand to hand their fight be long 
their heart be great their clamour menace 
their strength alike their stroke both dangerous 
but wrathful Nemesis that wicked power 
envy at Andrea praise and worth 
cut short his life to end his praise and worth 
she she herself disguise in armour mask 
as Pallas be before proud Pergamus 
bring in a fresh supply of halberdier 
which paunch his horse and ding he to the ground 
then young don Balthasar with ruthless rage 
take advantage of his foe distress 
do finish what his halberdier begin 
and leave not till Andrea life be do 
then though too late incense with just remorse 
I with my band set forth against the prince 
and bring he prisoner from his halberdier 

will thou have slay he that so slay my love 
but then be don Andrea carcase lose 

no that be it for which I chief strive 
nor step I back till I recover he 
I take he up and wound he in my arm 
And weld he unto my private tent 
there lay he down and dew he with my tear 
and sigh and sorrow as become a friend 
but neither friendly sorrow sigh nor tear 
can win pale death from his usurp right 
yet this I do and less I can not do 
I see he honour with due funeral 
this scarf I pluck from off his lifeless arm 
and wear it in remembrance of my friend 

I know the scarf will he have keep it still 
for have he live he will have keep it still 
and wear it for his Belimperia sake 
for it be my favour at his last depart 
but now wear thou it both for he and i 
for after he thou have deserve it best 
but for thy kindness in his life and death 
be sure while Belimperia life endure 
she will be don Horatio thankful friend 

and madam don Horatio will not slack 
humble to serve fair Belimperia 
but now if your good like stand thereto 
we crave your pardon to go seek the prince 
for so the duke your father give i charge 

ay go Horatio leave i here alone 
for solitude best fit my cheerless mood 
yet what avail to wail Andrea death 
from whence Horatio prove my second love 
have he not love Andria as he do 
he can not sit in Belimperia thought 
but how can love find harbour in my breast 
till I revenge the death of my belove 
yes second love shall further my revenge 
I will love Horatio my Andrea friend 
the more to spite the prince that wrought his end 
and where don Balthasar that slay my love 
himself now plead for favour at my hand 
he shall in rigour of my just disdain 
reap long repentance for his murderous deed 
for what be it else but murderous cowardice 
so many to oppress one valiant knight 
without respect of honour in the fight 
and here he come that murder my delight 

sister what mean this melancholy walk 

that for a while I wish no company 

but here the prince be come to visit you 

that argue that he live in liberty 

no madam but in please servitude 

your prison then belike be your conceit 

I by conceit my freedom be enthrall 

then with conceit enlarge yourself again 

what if conceit have lay my heart to gauge 

pay that you borrow and recover it 

I die if it return from whence it lie 

a heartless man and live a miracle 

I lady love can work such miracle 

tush tush my lord let go these ambage 
and in plain term acquaint she with your love 

what boot complaint when there be no remedy 

yes to your gracious self must I complain 
in who fair answer lie my remedy 
on who perfection all my thought attend 
on who aspect my eye find beauty bower 
in who translucent breast my heart be lodge 

alas my lord these be but word of course 
and but devise to drive i from this place 

madam your glove 

thank good Horatio take it for thy pain 

signior Horatio stoop in happy time 

I reap more grace than I deserve or hope 

my lord be not dismay for what be pass 
you know that woman oft be humorous 
these cloud will overblow with little wind 
let i alone I will scatter they myself 
meanwhile let we devise to spend the time 
in some delightful sport and revel 

the king my lord be come hither straight 
to feast the Portugal ambassador 
thing be in readiness before I come 

then here it fit we to attend the king 
to welcome hither our ambassador 
and learn my father and my country health 

see lord ambassador how Spain entreat 
their prisoner Balthasar thy viceroy son 
we pleasure more in kindness then in war 

sad be our king and Portugal lament 
suppose that don Balthasar be slay 

so be I slay by beauty tyranny 
you see my lord how Balthasar be slay 
I frolic with the duke of castiles son 
wrap every hour in pleasure of the court 
and grace with favour of his majesty 

put off your greeting till our feast be do 
now come and sit with we and taste our cheer 
sit down young prince you be our second guest 
brother sit down and nephew take your place 
signior Horatio wait thou upon our cup 
for well thou have deserve to be honour 
now lording fall too Spain be Portugal 
and Portugal be Spain we both be friend 
tribute be pay and we enjoy our right 
but where be old Hieronimo our marshal 
he promise we in honour of our guest 
to grace our banquet with some pompous jest 
Hieronimo this mask content my eye 
although I sound not well the mystery 

the first arm knight that hang his scutcheon up 
be English Robert earl of Gloucester 
who when king Stephen bear sway in Albion 
arrive with five and twenty thousand man 
in Portugal and by success of war 
enforce the king then but a Saracen 
to bear the yoke of the english monarchy 

my lord of Portugal by this you see 
that which may comfort both your king and you 
and make your late discomfort seem the less 
but say Hieronimo what be the next 

the second knight that hang his scutcheon up 
be Edmond earl of Kent in Albion 
when english Richard wear the diadem 
he come likewise and raze Lisbon wall 
and take the king of Portugal in fight 
for which and other such like service do 
he after be create duke of York 

this be another special argument 
that Portugal may deign to bear our yoke 
when it by little England have be yoke 
but now Hieronimo what be the last 

the three and last not least in our account 
be as the rest a valiant Englishman 
brave john of Gaunt the duke of Lancaster 
as by his scutcheon plain may appear 
he with a puissant army come to Spain 
and take our king of Castille prisoner 

this be a argument for our viceroy 
that Spain may not insult for her success 
since english warrior likewise conquer Spain 
and make they bow their knee to Albion 

Hieronimo I drink to thou for this devise 
which have please both the ambassador and i 
pledge i Hieronimo if thou love the king 
my lord I fear we sit but overlong 
unless our dainty be more delicate 
but welcome be you to the best we have 
now let we in that you may be dispatch 
I think our council be already set 

Come we for this from depth of under ground 
to see he feast that give i my death wound 
these pleasant sight be sorrow to my soul 
nothing but league and love and banquet 

be still Andrea ere we go from hence 
I will turn their friendship into fell despite 
their love to mortal hate their day tonight 
their hope into despair their peace to war 
their joy to pain their bliss to misery 

my lord though Belimperia seem thus coy 
let reason hold you in your wont joy 
in time the savage bull sustain the yoke 
in time all haggard hawk will stoop to lure 
in time small wedge cleave the hard oak 
in time the flint be pierce with soft shower 
and she in time will fall from her disdain 
and rue the sufferance of your friendly pain 

no she be wild and more hard withal 
then beast or bird or tree or stony wall 
but wherefore blot I Belimperia name 
it be my fault not she that merit blame 
my feature be not to content her sight 
my word be rude and work she no delight 
the line I send she be but harsh and ill 
such as do drop from pan and Marsias quill 
my present be not of sufficient cost 
and be worthless all my labour lose 
yet may she love i for my valiancy 
I but that be slander by captivity 
yet may she love i to content her fire 
I but her reason master his desire 
yet may she love i as her brother friend 
ay but her hope aim at some other end 
yet may she love i to uprear her state 
I but perhaps she hope some noble mate 
yet may she love i as her beauteous thrall 
ay but I fear she can love at all 

my lord for my sake leave these ecstasy 
and doubt not but we will find some remedy 
some cause there be that let you not be love 
first that must needs be know and then remove 
what if my sister love some other knight 

my summer day will turn to winter night 

I have already find a stratage i 
to sound the bottom of this doubtful theme 
my lord for once you shall be rule by i 
hinder i not whatever you hear or see 
by force of fire mean will I cast about 
to find the truth of all this question out 
ho Pedringano 

signior 

vien que presto 

have your lordship any service to command i 

i Pedringano service of import 
and not to spend the time in trifle word 
thus stand the case it be not long thou know 
since I do shield thou from my father wrath 
for thy conveyance in Andrea love 
for which thou be adjudge to punishment 
I stand betwixt thou and thy punishment 
and since thou know how I have favour thou 
now to these favour will I ad reward 
not with fair word but store of golden coin 
and land and live join with dignity 
if thou but satisfy my just demand 
tell truth and have i for thy last friend 

whatever it be your lordship shall demand 
my bind duty bid i tell the truth 
if case it lie in i to tell the truth 

then Pedringano this be my demand 
who love my sister Belimperia 
for she repose all her trust in thou 
speak man and gain both friendship and reward 
I mean who love she in Andrea place 

alas my lord since don Andrea death 
I have no credit with she as before 
and therefore know not if she love or no 

nay if thou dally then I be thy foe 
and fear shall force what friendship can win 
thy death shall bury what thy life conceal 
thou die for more esteem she then i 

o stay my lord 

yet speak the truth and I will guerdon thou 
and shield thou from whatever can ensue 
and will conceal whatever proceed from thou 
but if thou dally once again thou die 

if madam Belimperia be in love 

what villain if and and 

o stay my lord she love Horatio 

what don Horatio our knight marshal son 

Even he my lord 

now say but how know thou he be her love 
and thou shall find i kind and liberal 
stand up I say and fearless tell the truth 

she send he letter which myself peruse 
full fraught with line and argument of love 
prefer he before prince Balthasar 

swear on this cross that what thou say be true 
and that thou will conceal what thou have tell 

I swear to both by he that make we all 

in hope thy oath be true here be thy reward 
but if I prove thou perjure and unjust 
this very sword whereon thou take thy oath 
shall be the worker of thy tragedy 

what I have say be true and shall for i 
be still conceal from Belimperia 
beside your honour liberality 
deserve my duteous service even till death 

let this be all that thou shall do for i 
be watchful when and where these lover meet 
and give i notice in some secret sort 

I will my lord 

then shall thou find that I be liberal 
thou know that I can more advance thy state 
then she be therefore wise and fail i not 
go and attend she as thy custom be 
lest absence make she think thou do amiss 
why so t be armis quam ingenio 
where word prevail not violence prevail 
but gold do more than either of they both 
how like prince Balthasar this stratagem 

both well and ill it make i glad and sad 
glad that I know the hinderer of my love 
sad that I fear she hate i who I love 
glad that I know on who to be revenge 
sad that she will fly i if I take revenge 
yet must I take revenge or die myself 
for love resist grow impatient 
I think Horatio be my destined plague 
first in his hand he brandish a sword 
and with that sword he fierce wage war 
and in that war he give i dangerous wound 
and by those wound he force i to yield 
and by my yield I become his slave 
now in his mouth he carry please word 
which please word do harbour sweet conceit 
which sweet conceit be limn with sly deceit 
which sly deceit smooth Belimperia ear 
and through her ear dive down into her heart 
and in her heart set he where I shall stand 
thus have he take my body by his force 
and now by sleight will captivate my soul 
but in his fall I will tempt the destiny 
and either lose my life or win my love 

let we go my lord your stay stay revenge 
do you but follow i and gain your love 
her favour must be win by his remove

o aliquis mihi quas pulcbrum var educet herbas 
misceat & nostro detur medicina dolori 
aut siquifaciunt annum oblimia succos 
prebeat ipse metum magnam quicunque per orbem 
gramina sol pulcbras effecit inluminis oras 
ipse bibam quicquid meditatur saga veneri 
quicquid & irrani evecaca menia nectit 
omnia perpetiar letbum quoque dum semel omnis 
noster in extincto moriatur pectora sensus 
ergo tuos occulos nunquam mea vita videbo 
et tua perpetuus sepelivit lumina somnus 
emoriar tecum sic sic iuuat Ire  sub umbras 
attamen absistam proper  
ne mortem vindicte tuam iam nulla sequatur 
here he throw it from he and bear the body away 

bring thou i hither to increase my pain 
I look that Balthasar shall have be slay 
but it be my friend Horatius that be slay 
and they abuse fair Belimperia 
or who I dote more than all the world 
because she love i more than all the world 

thou talk of harvest when the corn be green 
the end be crown of every work well do 
the sickle come not till the corn be ripe 
be still and ere I lead thou from this place 
I will show thou Balthasar in heavy case 

infortunate condition of king 
seat amid so many helpless doubt 
first we be place upon extreme height 
and oft supplant with exceed heat 
but ever subject to the wheel of chance 
and at our high never joy we so 
as we both doubt and dread our overthrow 
So strive not the wave with sundry wind 
as fortune toil in the affair of king 
that will be fear yet fear to be belove 
sith fear or love to king be flattery 
for instance lording look upon your king 
by hate deprive of his dear son 
the only hope of our success successive line 

I have not think that Alexandro heart 
have be envenom with such extreme hate 
but now I see that word have several work 
and there be no credit in the countenance 

no for my lord have you behold the train 
that feign love have colour in his look 
when he in camp consort Belthazar 
far more inconstant have you think the sun 
that hourly coast the centre of the earth 
than Alexandro purpose to the prince 

no more Villuppo thou have say enough 
and with thy word thou slay our wound thought 
nor shall I long dally with the world 
procrastinate Alexandro death 
go some of you and fetch the traitor forth 
that as he be condemn he may die 

in such extreme will nought but patience serve 

but in extreme what patience shall I use 
nor discontent it i to leave the world 
with who there nothing can prevail but wrong 

yet hope the best 

it be heaven be my hope 
as for the earth it be too much infect 
to yield i hope of any of her mould 

why linger you bring forth that dare fiend 
and let he die for his accurse deed 

not that I fear the extremity of death 
for noble can stoop to servile fear 
do I oh king thus discontent live 
but this oh this torment my labour soul 
that thus I die suspect of a sin 
whereof as heaven have know my secret thought 
so be I free from this suggestion 

no more I say to the torture when 
bind he and burn his body in those flame 
that shall prefigure those unquenched fire 
of Phlegeton prepare for his soul 

my guiltless death will be avenge on thou 
on thou Villuppo that have malice thus 
or for thy meed have false i accuse 

nay Alexandro if thou menace i 
I will lend a hand to send thou to the lake 
where those thy word shall perish with thy work 
injurious traitor monstrous homicide 

ambassador what news have urge this sudden entrance 

know sovereign L that Balthasar do live 

what say thou live Balthasar our son 

your highness son L Balthasar do live 
and well entreat in the court of Spain 
humble commend he to your majesty 
these eye behold and these my follower 
with these the letter of the king commend 
be happy witness of his highness health 
the king look on the letter and proceed 

thy son do live your tribute be receive 
thy peace be make and we be satisfy 
the rest resolve upon as thing propose 
for both our honour and thy benefit 

these be his highness far article 

accurse wretch to intimate these ill 
against the life and reputation 
of noble Alexandro come my lord unbind he 
let he unbind thou that be bind to death 
to make a quitall for thy discontent 

dread lord in kindness you can do no less 
upon report of such a damn fact 
but thus we see our innocence have save 
the hopeless life which thou Villuppo seek 
by thy suggestion to have massacre 

say false Villuppo wherefore do thou thus 
false betray lord Alexandro life 
he who thou know that no unkindness else 
but even the slaughter of our dear son 
can once have move we to have misconceive 

say treacherous Villuppo tell the king 
or wherein have Alexandro use thou ill 

rend with remembrance of so foul a deed 
my guilty soul submit i to thy doom 
for not for Alexandro injury 
but forward and hope to be prefer 
thus have I shameless hazard his life 

which villain shall be ransom with thy death 
and not so mean a torment as we here 
devise for he who thou say slay our son 
but with the bitter torment and extreme 
that may be yet invent for thy end 
entreat i not go take the traitor hence 
and Alexandro let we honour thou 
with public notice of thy loyalty 
to end those thing articulate here 
by our great l the mighty king of Spain 
we with our council will deliberate 
come Alexandro keep we company 

o eye no eye but fountain fraught with tear 
o life no life but lively form of death 
o world no world but mass of public wrong 
confuse and fill with murder and misdeed 
o sacred heaven if this unhallowed deed 
if this inhuman and barbarous attempt 
if this incomparable murder thus 
of i but now no more my son 
shall unrevealed and unrevenged pass 
how shall we term your deal to be just 
if you unjust deal with those that in your justice trust 
the night sad secretary to my moan 
with direful vision wake my vex soul 
and with the wound of my distressful son 
solicit i for notice of his death 
the ugly fiend do sally forth of hell 
and frame my step to unfrequented path 
and fear my heart with fierce inflame thought 
the cloudy day my discontent record 
early begin to register my dream 
and drive i forth to seek the murderer 
eye life world heaven hell night and day 
see search show send some man 
some mean that may 
what be here a letter tush it be not so 
a letter write to Hieronimo 

for want of ink receive this bloody writ 
i have my hapless brother hide from thou 
revenge thyself on Balthasar and he 
for these be they that murder thy son 
Hieronimo revenge Horatio death 
and better fare than Belimperia do 

what mean this unexpected miracle 
my son slay by Lorenzo and the prince 
what cause have they Horatio to malign 
or what may move thou Belimperia 
to accuse thy brother have he be the mean 
Hieronimo beware thou be betray 
and to entrap thy life this train be lay 
advise thou therefore be not credulous 
this be devise to endanger thou 
that thou by this Lorenzo shall accuse 
and he for thy dishonour do shall draw 
thy life in question and thy name in hate 
dear be the life of my belove son 
and of his death behoove i be revenge 
then hazard not thy own Hieronimo 
but live to effect thy resolution 
I therefore will by circumstance try 
what I can gather to confirm this writ 
and harken near the duke of castiles house 
close if I can with Belimperia 
to listen more but nothing to bewray 

now Pedringano 

now Hieronimo 

where be thy lady 

I know not here be my lord 

how now who be this Hieronimo 

my lord 

he ask for my lady Belimperia 

what to do Hieronimo the duke my father have 
upon some disgrace a while remove she hence 
but if it be aught I may inform she of 
tell i Hieronimo and I will let she know it 

nay nay my lord I thank you it shall not need 
I have a suit unto she but too late 
and her disgrace make i unfortunate 

why so Hieronimo use i 

o no my lord I dare not it must not be 
I humble thank your lordship 

why then farewell 

my grief no heart my thought no tongue can tell 

Come hither Pedringano see thou this 

my lord I see it and suspect it too 

this be that damn villain Serberine 
that have I fear revealde Horatio death 

my lord he can not it be so late do 
and since he have not lest my company 

admit he have not his condition such 
as fear of flatter word may make he false 
I know his humour and there with repent 
that ere I use he in this enterprise 
but Pedringano to prevent the worst 
and cause I know thou secret as my soul 
here for thy further satisfaction take thou this 
give he more gold 
and harken to i thus it be devise 
this night thou must and prithee so resolve 
meet Serberine at S Liugi park 
thou know it be here hard by behind the house 
there take thy stand and see thou strike he sure 
for die he must if we do mean to live 

but how shall Serberine be there my lord 

let i alone I will send to he to meet 
the prince and i where thou must do this deed 

it shall be do my L it shall be do 
and I will go arm myself to meet he there 

when thing shall alter as I hope they will 
then shall thou mount for this thou know my mind 

my lord 

go sirrah to Serberine and bid he forthwith 
meet the prince and i at S Liugi park 
behind the house this evening boy 

I go my lord 
but sirrah let the hour be eight o'clock 
bid he not fail 

I fly my lord 

now to confirm the complot thou have cast 
of all these practise I will spread the watch 
upon precise commandment from the king 
strong to guard the place where Pedringano 
this night shall murder hapless Serberine 
thus must we work that will avoid distrust 
thus must we practise to prevent mishap 
and thus one ill another must expulse 
this sly enquiry of Hieronimo for Belimperia breed suspicion 
and this suspicion bode a further ill 
as for myself I know my secret fault 
and so do they but I have deal for they 
they that for coin their soul endanger 
to save my life for coin shall venture they 
and better it be that base companion die 
then by their life to hazard our good hap 
nor shall they live for i to fear their faith 
I will trust myself myself shall be my friend 
for die they shall slave be ordain to no other end 
now Pedringano bid thy pistol hold 
and hold on fortune once more favour i 
give but success to my at tempt spirit 
and let i shift for take of i aim 
here be the gold this be the gold propose 
it be no dream that I adventure for 
but Pedringano be possess thereof 
and he that will not strain his conscience 
for he that thus his liberal purse have stretch 
unworthy such a favour may he fail 
and wis want when such as I prevail 
as for the fear of apprehension 
I know if need shall be my noble lord 
will stand between i and ensue harm 
beside this place be free from all suspect 
here therefore will I stay and take my stand 

I wonder much to what intent it be 
that we be thus express charge to watch 

it be by commandment in the king own name 

but we be never wont to watch and ward 
so near the duke his brother house before 

content yourself stand close there be somewhat in it 

here Serberine attend and stay thy pace 
for here do don Lorenzo page appoint 
that thou by his command shall meet with he 
how fit a place if one be so dispose 
methinks this corner be to close with one 

here come the bird that I must cease upon 
now Pedringano or never play the man 

I wonder that his lordship stay so long 
or wherefore shall he send for i so late 

for this Serberine and thou shall have it 
So there he lie my promise be perform 

hark gentleman this be a pistolshot 

and here be one slay stay the murderer 

now by the sorrow of the soul in hell 
who first lay hand on i I will be his priest 

sirrah confess and therein play the priest 
why have thou thus unkind kill the man 

why because he walk abroad so late 

Come sir you have be better keep your bed 
then have commit this misdeed so late 

Come to the marshal with the murderer 

on to Hieronimo help i here 
to bring the murder body with we too 

Hieronimo carry i before who you will 
whatever he be I will answer he and you 
and do your worst for I defy you all 

how now my lord what make you rise so soon 

fear of prevent our mishap too late 

what mischief be it that we not mistrust 

our great ill we least mistrust my lord 
and in expect harm do hurt we most 

why tell i don Lorenzo tell i man 
if aught concern our honour and your own 

nor you nor i my lord but both in one 
for I suspect and the presumption great 
that by those base confederate in our fault 
touch the death of don Horatio 
we be betray to old Hieronimo 

betray Lorenzo tush it can be 

a guilty conscience urge with the thought 
of former evil easy can err 
I be persuade and dissuade i not 
that all be reveal to Hieronimo 
and therefore know that I have cast it thus 
but here be the page how now what news with thou 

my lord Serberine be slay 

who Serberine my man 

your highness man my lord 

speak page who murder he 

he that be apprehend for the fact 

who 

Pedringano 

be Serberine slay that love his lord so well 
injurious villain murderer of his friend 

have Pedringano murder Serberine 
my lord let i entreat you to take the pain 
to exasperate and hasten his revenge 
with your complaint unto my L the king 
this their dissension breed a great doubt 

assure thou don Lorenzo he shall die 
or else his highness hardly shall deny 
meanwhile I will haste the martial session 
for die he shall for this his damn deed 

why so this fit our former policy 
and thus experience bid the wise to deal 
I lay the plot he prosecute the point 
I set the trap he break the worthless twig 
and see not that wherewith the bird be lime 
thus hopeful man that mean to hold their own 
must look like fowler to their dear friend 
he run to kill who I have help to catch 
and no man know it be my reach fatch 
it be hard to trust unto a multitude 
or any one in my opinion 
when man themselves their secret will reveal 

boy 

my lord 

what be he 

I have a letter to your lordship 

from whence 

from Pedringano that be imprison 

So he be in prison then 

I my good lord 

what will he with we 
he write we here to stand good L and help he in distress 
tell he I have his letter know his mind 
and what we may let he assure he of 
fellow be go my boy shall follow thou 
this work like wax yet once more try thy wit 
boy go convey this purse to Pedringano 
thou know the prison close give it he 
and be advise that none be there about 
bid he be merry still but secret 
and though the martial session be today 
bid he not doubt of his delivery 
tell he his pardon be already sign 
and thereon bid he bold be resolve 
for be he ready to be turn off 
as it be my will the uttermost be try 
thou with his pardon shall attend he still 
show he this box tell he his pardon in it 
but open it not and if thou love thy life 
but let he wise keep his hope unknown 
he shall not want while don Lorenzo live away 

I go my lord I run 

but sirrah see that this be clean do 
now stand our fortune on a tickle point 
and now or never end Lorenzo doubt 
one only thing be uneffected yet 
and that be to see the executioner 
but to what end I list not trust the air 
with utterance of our pretence therein 
for fear the privy whisper of the wind 
convey our word among unfriendly ear 
that lie too open to advantage 
et quel que voglio it nessun le sa 
intendo io quel mi bassara 
my master have forbid i to look in this box and by my troth it be likely if he have not warn i I shall not have have so much idle time for we mankind in our minority be like woman in their uncertainty that they be most forbid they will soon attempt so I now by my bare honesty here be nothing but the bare empty box be it not sin against secrecy I will say it be a piece of gentlemanlike knavery I must go to Pedringano and tell he his pardon be in this box nay I will have swear it have I not see the contrary I can choose but smile to think how the villain will flout the gallows scorn the audience and descant on the hangman and all presume of his pardon from hence will not be a odd jest for i to stand and grace every jest he make point my finger at this box as who will say mock on here be thy warrant be it not a scurvy jest that a man shall jest himself to death alas poor Pedringano I be in a sort sorry for thou but if I shall be hang with thou I can weep 

thus must we toil in other man extreme 
that know not how to remedy our own 
and do they justice when unjust we 
for all our wrong can compass no redress 
but shall I never live to see the day 
that I may come by justice of the heaven 
to know the cause that may my care allay 
this toil my body this consume age 
that only I to all man just must be 
and neither god nor man be just to i 

worthy Hieronimo your office ask 
a care to punish such as do transgress 

So be it my duty to regard his death 
who when he live deserve my dear blood 
but come for that we come for let we begin 
for here lie that which bid i to be go 

bring forth the prisoner for the court be set 

gramercy boy but it be time to come 
for I have write to my lord anew 
a near matter that concern he 
for fear his lordship have forget i 
but sith he have remember i so well 
come come come on when shall we to this gear 

stand forth thou monster murderer of man 
and here for satisfaction of the world 
confess thy folly and repent thy fault 
for there be thy place of execution 

this be short work well to your martialship 
first I confess nor fear I death therefore 
I be the man it be I slay Serberine 
but sir than you think this shall be the place 
where we shall satisfy you for this gear 

i Pedringano 

now I think not so 

peace impudent for thou shall find it so 
for blood with blood shall while I sit as judge 
be satisfy and the law discharge 
and though myself can receive the like 
yet will I see that other have their right 
dispatch the fault approve and confess 
and by our law he be condemn to die 

Come on sit be you ready 

to do what my fine officious knave 

to go to this gear

as for his resolution in his end 
leave that to he with who he sojourn now 
here take my ring and give it Christophill 
and bid he let my sister be enlarge 
and bring she hither straight 
this that I do be for a policy 
to smooth and keep the murder secret 
which as a nine day wonder be overblow 
my gentle sister will I now enlarge 

and time Lorenzo for my lord the duke 
you hear inquire for her yesternight

and if she hap to stand on term with we 
as for her sweet heart and concealment so 
lest with she gentle under feign jest 
be thing conceal that else will breed unrest 
but here she come 

now sister 

sister no thou be no brother but a enemy 
else will thou not have use thy sister so 
first to affright i with thy weapon draw 
and with extreme abuse my company

and clap i up where none may come at i 
nor I at any to reveal my wrong 
what mad fury do possess thy wit 
or wherein be it that I offend thou 

advise you better Belimperia 
for I have do you no disparagement 
unless by more discretion than deserve 
I seek to save your honour and my own 

my honour why Lorenzo where in be it 
that I neglect my reputation so 
as you or any need to rescue it 

his highness and my father be resolve 
to come confer with old Hieronimo 
concern certain matter of estate 
that by the viceroy be determine 

and wherein be my honour touch in that

i next in sight as messenger they send 
to give he notice that they be so nigh 
now when I come consort with the prince 
and unexpected in a arbour there

how than 

why then remember that old disgrace 
which you for don Andrea have endure 
and now be likely long to sustain 
by be find so mean accompany 
think rather for I know no ready mean 
to thrust Horatio forth my father way 

and carry you obscure somewhere else 
lest that his highness shall have find you there 

Even so my lord and you be witness 
that this be true which he entreat of 
you gentle brother forge this for my sake 
and you my lord be make his instrument 
a work of worth worthy the note too 
but what be the cause that you conceal i since 

your melancholy sister since the news 
of your first favourite don Andrea death 
my father old wrath have exasperate 

and better be it for you be in disgrace 
to absent yourself and give his fury place 

but why have I no notice of his ire 

that be to add more fuel to your fire 
who burn like Aetna for Andrea loss 

have not my father then inquire for i 

sister he have and thus excuse I thou 
but Belimperia see the gentle prince

who 

Belimperia 

fear yourself

est tremulo metui pavidum iunxere timorem 
et vanum stolidae proditionis opus 

nay and you argue thing so cunning 
we will go continue this discourse at court

that lead from a guilty conscience 
unto a forest of distrust and fear

who baleful humour if you but uphold 
it will conduct you to despair and death 
who rocky cliff when you have once behold 
within a huge dale of last night 
that kindle with the world iniquity 
do cast up filthy and detest fume 
not far from thence where murderer have build 
a habitation for their curse soul

that lead unto the lake where hell do stand 
away Hieronimo to he be go

and kingly love he kind let thou know 
first for the marriage of his princely son 
with Belimperia thy belove niece 
the news be more delightful to his soul 
than myrrh or incense to the offend heaven 
in person therefore will he come himself 
to see the marriage rite solemnize 
and in the presence of the court of Spain 
to knit a sure inexecrable band 
of kingly love and everlasting league 
betwixt the crown of Spain and Portugal 
there will he give his crown to Balthasar 
and make a queen of Belimperia 

brother how like you this our viceroy love

of honourable care to keep his friend

of such in gratitude unto thy son 
unhappy mother of such child then 
but monstrous father to forget so soon 
the death of those who they with care and cost 
have tender so thus careless shall be lose

nor shall his death be unrevenged by i 
although I bear it out for fashion sake 
for here I swear in sight of heaven and earth 
shall thou neglect the love thou shall retain 
and give it over and devise no more 
myself shall send their hateful soul to hell 
that wrought his downfall with extreme death 

but may it be that Belimperia 
vow such revenge as she have deign to say 
why then I see that heaven apply our drift 
and all the saint do sit solicit 
for vengeance on those curse murderer 
madam it be true and now I find it so 
I find a letter write in your name 
and in that letter how Horatio die 
pardon oh pardon Belimperia 
my fear and care in not believe it 
nor think I thoughtless think upon a mean 
to let his death be unrevenged at full 
and here I vow so you but give consent 
and will conceal my resolution 
I will ere long determine of their death 
that causeless thus have murder my son 

Hieronimo I will consent conceal 
and aught that may effect for thy avail 
join with thou to revenge Horatio death 

on then whatsoever I devise 
let i entreat you grace my practise 
for why the plot already in my head 
here they be 

how now Hieronimo what court Belimperia 

I my lord such court as I promise you 
she have my heart but you my lord have she 

but now Hieronimo or never we be to entreat your help 

my help why my good lord assure yourselves of i 
for you have give i cause I by my faith have you 

it please you at the entertainment of the ambassador 
to grace the king so much as with a show 
now be your study so well furnish 
as for the pass of the first night sport 
to entertain my father with the like 
or any such like please motion 
assure yourself it will content they well 

be this all 

ay this be all 

why then I will fit you say no more 
when I be young I give my mind 
and apply myself to fruitless poetry 
which though it profit the professor nought 
yet be it pass please to the world 

and how for that 

marry my good lord thus 
and yet methinks you be too quick with we 
when in Toledo there I study 
it be my chance to write a tragedy 
see here my lord 
which long forget I find this other day 
now will your lordship favour i so much 
as but to grace i with your act it 
I mean each one of you to play a part 
assure you it will prove most pass strange 
and wondrous plausible to that assembly 

what will you have we play a tragedy 

why Nero think it no disparagement 
and king and emperor have take delight 
to make experience of their wit in play 

nay be not angry good Hieronimo 
the prince but ask a question 

in faith Hieronimo and you be in earnest 
I will make one 

and I another 

now my good lord can you entreat 
your sister Belimperia to make one 
for what be a play without a woman in it 

little entreaty shall serve i Hieronimo 
for I must needs be employ in your play 

why this be well I tell you lording 
it be determine to have be act 
by gentleman and scholar too 
such as can tell what to speak 

and now it shall be play by prince and courtier 
such as can tell how to speak 
if as it be our country manner 
you will but let we know the argument 

that shall I roundly the chronicle of Spain 
record this write of a knight of Rhodes 
he be betroth and wed at the length 
to one Perseda a italian dame 
who beauty ravish all that she behold 
especial the soul of Soliman 
who at the marriage way the chief guest 
by sundry mean seek Soliman to win 
Perseda love and can not gain the same 
then begin he break his passion to a friend 
one of his pasha who he hold full dear 
her have this bashaw long solicit 
and see she be not otherwise to be win 
but by her husband death this knight of Rhodes 
who present by treachery he slay 
she stir with a exceed hate therefore 
as cause of this slay Soliman 
and to escape the pasha tyranny 
do stab herself and this the tragedy 

o excellent 

but say Hieronimo what then become of he 
that be the bashaw 

marry thus move with remorse of his misdeed 
run to a mountain top and hang himself 

but which of we be to perform that part 

o that will I my lord make no doubt of it 
I will play the murderer I warrant you 
for I already have conceit that 

and what shall I 

great Soliman the turkish emperor 

and I 

Erastus the knight of Rhodes 

and I 

Perseda chaste and resolute 
and here my lord be several abstract draw 
for each of you to note your part 
and act it as occasion be offer you 
you must provide a turkish cap 
a black mustacio and a falchion 
you with a cross like to a knight of Rhodes 
and madam you must attire yourself 
like Phoebe Flora or the huntress 
which to your discretion shall seem best 
and as for i my lord I will look to one 
and with the ransom that the viceroy send 
so furnish and perform this tragedy 
as all the world shall say Hieronimo 
be liberal in grace of it so 

Hieronimo methinks a comedy be better 

a comedy fie comedy be fit for common wit 
but to present a kingly troop withal 
give i a stately write tragedy 
tragedia cothernato fit king 
contain matter and not common thing 
my lord all this must be perform 
as sit for the first night revel 
the italian tragedian be so sharp of wit 
that in one hour meditation 
they will perform any thing in action 

and well it may for I have see the like 
in Paris among the french tragedian 

in Paris mass and well remember 
there be one thing more that rest for we to do 

what be that Hieronimo forget not any thing 

each one of we must act his part 
in unknown language 
that it may breed the more variety 
as you my lord in latin I in greek 
you in italian and for because I know 
that Belimperia have practise the french 
in courtly french shall all her phrase be 

you mean to try my cunning than Hieronimo 

but this will be a mere confusion 
and hardly shall we all be understand 

it must be so for the conclusion 
shall prove the invention and all be good 
and I myself in a oration 
that I will have there behind a curtain 
and with a strange and wondrous show beside 
assure yourself shall make the matter know 
and all shall be conclude in one scene 
for there be no pleasure take in tediousness 

how like you this 

why thus my lord we must resolve 
to soothe his humour up 

on then Hieronimo farewell till soon 

you will ply this gear 

I warrant you 

why so now shall I see the fall of Babylon 
wrought by the heaven in this confusion 
and if the world like not this tragedy 
hard be the hap of old Hieronimo 
tell i no more oh monstrous homicide 
since neither piety nor pity move 
the king to justice or compassion 
I will revenge myself upon this place 
where thus they murder my belove son 
down with these branch and these loathsome bow 
of this unfortunate and fatal pine 
down with they Isabel rent they up 
and burn the root from whence the rest be spring 
I will not leave a root a stalk a tree 
a bow a branch a blossom nor a leaf 
no not a herb within this garden plot 
accurse complot of my misery 
fruitless for ever may this garden be 
barren the earth and blissless whosoever 
imagine not to keep it unmanured 
a eastern wind commix with noisome air 
shall blast the plant and the young sapling 
the earth with serpent shall be pester be 
and passenger for fear to be infect 
shall stand aloof and look at it tell 
there murder die the son of Isabella 
I here he die and here I he embrace 
see where his ghost solicit with his wound 
revenge on she that shall revenge his death 
Hieronimo make haste to see thy son 
for sorrow and despair have excite i 
to hear Horatio plead with Rhadamanthus 
make haste Hieronimo to hold excuse 
thy negligence in pursuit of their death 
who hateful wrath bereave he of his breath 
ah nay thou do delay their death 
forgive the murderer of thy noble son 
and none but I bestir i to no end 
and as I curse this tree from further fruit 
so shall my womb be curse for his sake 
and with this weapon will I wound the breast 
the hapless breast that give Horatio suck 

how now Hieronimo where be your fellow 
that you take all this pain 

o sir it be for the author credit 
to look that all thing may go well 
but good my lord let i entreat your grace 
to give the king the copy of the play 
this be the argument of what we show 

I will Hieronimo 

one thing more my good lord 

what be that 

let i entreat your grace 
that when the train be pass into the gallery 
you will vouchsafe to throw i down the key 

I will Hieronimo 

what be you ready Balthasar 
bring a chair and a cushion for the king 
well do Balthasar hang up the title 
our scene be Rhodes what be your beard on 

half on the other be in my hand 

dispatch for shame be you so long 
bethink thyself Hieronimo 
recall thy wit recompt thy former wrong 
thou have receive by murder of thy son 
and last not least how Isabella 
once his mother and thy dear wife 
all woe begone for he have slay herself 
behoove thou then Hieronimo to be revenge 
the plot be lay of dire revenge 
on then Hieronimo pursue revenge 
for nothing want but act of revenge 

now viceroy shall we see the tragedy 
of Soliman the turkish emperor 
perform of pleasure by your son the prince 
my nephew don Lorenzo and my niece 

who Belimperia 

ay and Hieronimo our marshal 
at who request they deign to do it themselves 
these be our pastime in the court of Spain 
here brother you shall be the book keeper 
this be the argument of that they show 

bassa that Rhodes be we yield heaven the honour 
and holy Mahomet our sacred prophet 
and be thou grace with every excellence 
that Soliman can give or thou desire 
but thy desert in conquer Rhodes be less 
than in reserve this fair christian nymph 
Perseda blissful lamp of excellence 
who eye compel like powerful adamant 
the warlike heart of Soliman to wait 

see viceroy that be Balthazar your son 
that represent the emperor Solyman 
how well he act his amorous passion 

i Belimperia have teach he that 

that be because his mind ton all on Belimperia 

whatever joy earth yield betide your majesty 

earth yield no joy without Perseda love 

let then Perseda on your grace attend 

she shall not wait on i but I on she 
draw by the influence of her light I yield 
but let my friend the rhodian knight come forth 
Erasto dear than my life to i 
that he may see Perseda my belove 

here come Lorenzo look up on the plot 
and tell i brother what part play he 

ah my Erasto welcome to Perseda 

thrice happy be Erasto that thou live 
Rhodes loss be nothing to Erasto joy 
sith his Perseda live his life survive 

ah bashaw here be love between Erasto 
and fair Perseda sovereign of my soul 

remove Erasto mighty Solyman 
and then Perseda will be quick win 

Erasto be my friend and while he live 
Perseda never will remove her love 

let not Erasto live to grieve great Soliman 

dear be Erasto in our princely eye 

but if he be your rival let he die 

why let he die so love command i 
yet grieve I that Erasto shall so die 

Erasto Solyman salute thou 
and let thou wit by i his highness will 
which be thou shall be thus employ 

ay i Erasto see Solyman Erasto be slay 

yet live Solyman to comfort thou 
fair queen of beauty let not favour die 
but with a gracious eye behold his grief 
that with Perseda beauty be increase 
if by Perseda grief be not release 

tyrant desist solicit vain suit 
relentless be my ear to thy lament 
as thy butcher be pitiless and base 
which seize on my Erasto harmless knight 
yet by thy power thou think to command 
and to thy power Perseda do obey 
but be she able thus she will revenge 
thy treachery on thou ignoble prince 
and on herself she will be thus revenge 

well say old marshal this be brave do 

but Belimperia play Perseda well 

be this in earnest Belimperia 
you will be better to my son then so 

but now what follow for Hieronimo 

marry this follow for Hieronimo 
here break we off our sundry language 
and thus conclude I in our vulgar tongue 
happy you think but bootless be your thought 
that this be fabulous counterfeit 
and that we do as all tragedian do 
to die today for fashion our scene 
the death of Aiax or some roman peer 
and in a minute start up again 
revive to please to morrow audience 
no prince know I be Hieronimo 
the hopeless father of a hapless son 
who tongue be tune to tell his late tale 
not to excuse gross error in the play 
I see your look urge instance of these word

from forth these wound come breath that give i life

the cause be love whence grow this mortal hate 
the hate Lorenzo and young Balthasar 
the love my son to Belimperia 
but night the coverer of accurse crime 
with pitchy silence hush these traitor harm 
and lend they leave for they have sort leisure 
to take advantage in my garden plot 
upon my son my dear Horatio 
there merciless they butcher up my boy 
in black dark night to pale dim cruel death 
he shriek I hear and yet methinks I hear 
his dismal outcry echo in the air 
with soon speed I haste to the noise 
where hang on a tree I find my son 
through gird with wound and slaughter as you see 
and grieve I think you at this spectacle 
speak Portugese who loss resemble i 
if thou can weep upon thy Balthasar

so viceroy be this Balthasar thy son 
that Soliman which Belimperia 
in person of Perseda murder 
sole appoint to that tragic part 
that she may slay he that offend she 
poor Belimperia miss her part in this 
for though the story say she shall have die 
yet I of kindness and of care to she 
do otherwise determine of her end 
but love of he who they do hate too much 
do urge her resolution to be such 
and prince now behold Hieronimo 
author and actor in this tragedy 
bear his late fortune in his fist 
and will as resolute conclude his part
