into thy lap will he advance thy fortune 
shall thou be mighty wench

upon my knee I ask your sacred pardon 
for my rude boldness and know my sweet mistress

fly from these vanity as mere illusion 
and arm with honesty defy all promise 
in token of this truth I lay my life down 
under your sacred foot to do you service

thou virgin honour sweet blow and flourish 
and that rude nip wind that seek to blast thou 
or taint thy root be curse to all posterity 
to my protection from this hour I take you 
yes and the king shall know 

Give his heat way madam 
and it will go out again he may forget all exeunt 

what have we to do with the time we can cure they 
let they go on when they be swell with surfeit 
they will burst and stink than all the world shall smell they 

a man may live a bawd and be a honest man 

yes and a wise man too it be a virtuous call 

to his own wife especial or to his sister 
the near to his own blood still the honest 
there want such honest man will we have more of they 

to be a villain be no such rude matter 

no if he be a neat one and a perfect 
art make all excellent what be it gentleman 
in a good cause to kill a dozen coxcomb 
that blunt rude fellow call good patriot 
Nothing nor never look after 

it be even as much as easy too as honest and as clear 
to ravish matron and deflower coy wench 
but here they be so willing it be a compliment 

to pull down church with pretention 
to build they fair may be do with honour 
and all this time believe no god 

I think so it be faith enough if they name he in their anger 
or on their rot tomb engrave a angel 
well brave Alphonso how happy have we be 
if thou have reigned 

will I have his disease 
tie like a leprosy to my posterity 
so he be right again 

what be his Melady 

nothing but sad and silent melancholy 
lade with grief and thought no man know why neither 
the good Brandino father to the princess 
use all the art and industry that may be 
to free Alphonso from this dull calamity 
and seat he in his rule he be his elder 
and noble too have not fair nature stop in he 
for which cause this be choose to inherit 
Frederick the young 

do he use his brother 
with that respect and honour that befit he 

he be keep private as they pretend 
to give more ease and comfort to his sickness 
but he have honest servant the grave Rugio 
and friar Marco that weight upon his person 
and in a monastery he live 

it be full of sadness 
to see he when he come to his father tomb 
as once a day that be his pilgrimage 
while in devotion the choir sing a anthem 
how pious he kneel and like a virgin 
that some cross fate have cozen of her love 
weep till the stubborn marble sweat with pity 
and to his groan the whole choir bear a chorus 

so do I too the king with his contriver 
this be no place for we exeunt lord 

this be a jewel 
lay it aside what paper be that 

a letter 
but it be a woman sir I know by the hand 
and the false orthography they write old saxon 

may be her ghostly mother that instruct she

what be that 

a pair of glove the duchess give she 
for so the outside say 

that other paper 

a charm for the toothache here be nothing but saint and cross 

look in that box methinks that shall hold secret 

it be paint and curl of hair she begin to exercise 
a glass of water too I will fain taste it 
but I be wicked afraid it will silence i 
never a conduit pipe to convey this water 

these be all ring death head and such memento

to tell she what her beauty must arrive at 

that that 

they be write song sir to provoke young lady 
lord here be a prayer book how these agree 
here be a strange union

let those complain that feel love cruelty 
and in sad legend write their woe 
with rose gentle have correct i 
my war be without rage or blow 
my mistress eye shine fair on my desire 
and hope spring up inflame with her new fire 
no more a exile will I dwell 
with fold arm and sigh all day 
reckon the torment of my hell 
and fling my sweet joy away

yet what be live in her eye 
or be bless with her sweet tongue

have you but plant enough of this bless tree sir 
set round about your court to beautify it

the ground will scarce yield grave to noble lover 

it be well maintain you wish and pray to fortune 
here in your sonnet and she have hear your prayer 
so much you dote upon your own undo 
but one month to enjoy she as your wife 
though at the expire of that time you die for it 

I can wish many many age sir

if heaven will grant it and you smile upon it 
but if my choice be two hour and then perish

and bless my youth with her most dear embrace 
I have do my journey here my day be out

be only make to wonder at a little 
enough for humane eye and then to wander from 
Come do not weep sweet you dishonour i 
your tear and grief but question my ability 
whether I dare die do you love entire

then grudge not my felicity 

I will to the queen 

do any thing that be honest 
but if you sue to he in death I hate you 

be there ever hear of such a marriage 

marriage and hang go by destiny 
it be the old proverb now they come together 

but a month marry than to lose his life for it 
I will have a long month sure that pay the soldier 

or get all the almanac burn that be a rare trick 
and have no month remember how now Tony 
who water be you cast 

a sick gentleman 
be very sick much trouble with the stone 
he shall not live above a month by his urine 
about saint David day it will go hard with he 
he will then be trouble with a pain in his neck too 

a pestilent fool when will thou marry Tony 

when I mean to be hang and it be the sure contract 

what think you of this marriage of Valerio 

they have give he a hot custard and mean to burn his mouth with it have I know he have be give to die honourable I will have help he to a wench a rare one shall have kill he in three week and save the sentence 

there be they will have spare ten day of that too 

it may be so you have woman of all virtue 
there be some gun that I can bring he too 
some mortarpiece that be place in the suburb 
will tear he into quarter in two hour 
there be also of the race of the old cockatrice 
that will dispatch he with once look on he 

what month will thou choose Tony if thou have the like fortune 

I will choose a mull sack month to comfort my belly for sure my back will ache for it and at the month end I will be most dismal drink and scorn the gallow 

I will choose march for I will come in like a lion 

but you will go out like a lamb when you go to hang 

I will take April take the sweet of the year 
and kiss my wench upon the tender floweret 
tumble on every green and as the bird sing 
embrace and melt away my soul in pleasure 

you will go aMaying gay to the gallows 

prithee tell we some news 

I will tell you all I know 
you may be honest and poor fool as I be 
and blow your finger end

you may be knave then when you please stark knave 
and build fair house but your heir shall have none of they 

these be undoubted 

truth be not worth the hear 
I will tell you news then there be a drunken sailor 
that get a mermaid with child as she go a milk 
and now she sue he in the bawdy court for it 
the infant monster be bring up in Fishstreet

I will tell you more there be a fish take 
a monstrous fish with a sword by his side a long sword 
a pike in his neck and a gun in his nose a huge gun 
and letter of mart in his mouth from the duke of Florence 

this be a monstrous lie 

I do confess it 
do you think I will tell you truth that dare not hear they 
you be honest thing we courtier scorn to converse with exit 

a plaguy fool but let we consider gentleman 
why the queen strive not to oppose this sentence 
the kingdom honour suffer in this cruelty 

no doubt the queen though she be virtuous 
wink at the marriage for by that only mean 
the king flame lessen to the youthful lady 
if not go out within this month I doubt not 
she hope to rock asleep his anger also 
shall we go see the preparation 
it be time for stranger come to view the wonder 

Come let we away send my friend happy wedding exeunt 

you shall be merry come I will have it so 
can there be any nature so unnoble 
or anger so unhuman to pursue this 

I fear there be 

your fear be poor and foolish 
though he be hasty and his anger death 
his will like torrent not to be resist 
yet law and justice go along to guide he 
and what law or what justice can he find 
to justify his will what act or statute 
by humane or divine establishment 
leave to direct we that make marriage death 
honest fair wedlock it be give for increase 
for preservation of mankind I take it 
he must be more than man then that dare break it 
come dress you handsome you shall have my jewel 
and put a face on that contemn base fortune 
it will make he more insult to see you fearful 
outlook his anger 

o my Valerio 
be witness my pure mind it be thou I grieve for 

but show it not I will so crucify he 
with a innocent neglect of what he can do 
a brave strong pious scorn that I will shake he 
put all the wanton Cupid in thy eye 
and all the grace on that nature give thou 
make up thy beauty to that height of excellence 
I will help thou and forgive thou as if Venus 
be now again to catch the god of war 
in his most rugged anger when thou have he 
as it be impossible he shall resist thou 
and kneel at thy conquer foot for mercy 
then show thy virtue then again despise he 
and all his power then with a look of honour 
mingle with noble chastity strike he dead 

good madam dress i 
you arm i brave 

make he know his cruelty 
begin with he first he must suffer for it 
and that thy sentence be so welcome to thou 
and to thy noble lord you long to meet it 
stamp such a deep impression of thy beauty 
into his soul and of thy worthiness 
that when Valerio and Evanthe sleep 
in one rich earth hang round about with blessing 
he may run mad and curse his act be lusty 
I will teach thou how to die too if thou fear it 

I thank your grace you have prepare i strong 
and my weak mind 

death be unwelcome never 
unless it be to torture mind and sick soul 
that make their own hell it be such a benefit 
when it come crown with honour show so sweet too 
though they paint it ugly that be but to restrain we 
for every live thing will love it else 
fly bold to their peace ere nature call they 
the rest we have from labour and from trouble 
be some incitement every thing alike 
the poor slave that lie private have his liberty 
as ample as his master in that tomb 
the earth as light upon he and the flower 
that grow about he smell as sweet and flourish 
but when we love with honour to our end 
when memory and virtue be our mourner 
what pleasure be there they be infinite Evanthe 
only my virtuous wench we want our sense 
that benefit we be bar it will make we proud else 
and lazy to look up to happy life 
the blessing of the people will so swell we 

good madam dress i you have dress my soul 
the merry bride I will be for all this misery 
the proud to some eye too 

it will do better come shrink no more 

I be too confident exeunt 

you be too remiss and wanton in your anger 
you mould thing handsome and then neglect they 
a powerful prince shall be constant to his power still 
and hold up what he build than people fear he 
when he let loose his hand it show a weakness 
and man examine or contemn his greatness 
a scorn of this high kind shall have call up 
a revenge equal not a pity in you 

she be thy sister 

and she be my mother 
while I conceive she have you wrong I hate she 
and shake her nearness off I study sir 
to satisfy your anger that be just 
before your pleasure 

I have do that already 
I fear have pull to many curse on i 

curse or envy on Valerio head 
will you take my counsel sir they shall all light 
and with the weight not only crack his scull 
but his fair credit the exquisite vexation 
I have devise so please you give way in it 
and let it work shall more afflict his soul 
and trench upon that honour that he brag of

and that short month I have to bless i with her 
I will make a age I will reckon each embrace 
a year of pleasure and each night a jubilee 
every quick kiss a spring and when I mean 
to lose myself in all the delightfulness 
twenty sweet summer I will tie together 
in spite of thou and thy malignant master 
I will die old in love though young in pleasure 

but that I hate thou deadly I can pity thou

make i a traitor any thing I will yield to it 
and give thou cause so I may die immediate 
lock i in prison where no sun may see i 
in wall so thick no hope may ere come at i 
keep i from meat and drink and sleep I will bless thou

and bow their stubborn arm look on my weakness 
and when you please and how allay my misery Exit

will make he curse his birth I tell you which way 
do you but see he sir but look upon he 
with what a trouble and deject nature

you will wonder and admire for all you know it 
his jollity be down vail to the ground sir 
and his high hope of full delight and pleasure 
be turn torment to he strong disease 

but be there hope of she 

it must fall necessary

of humane fire that burn out as it kindle 
and leave the body but a poor repentance 
can ever mix let we six on that Evanthe 
that be everlasting the other casual

I will be thy friend if that may win thy courtesy 

I will not be your bawd though for your royalty 
be I bring up and nourish in the court 
with thy most royal brother and thyself 
upon thy father charge thy happy father 
and suck the sweetness of all humane art 
learned arm and honour to become a rascal 
be this the expectation of my youth 
my growth of honour do you speak this true 
or do you try i sir for I believe not 
at least I will not and methinks it be impossible 
there shall be such a devil in a king shape

two precious life may be redeem with nothing 
little or nothing say a hour or day sport 
or such a toy the end to it be wantonness 
that we call lust that maiden lose their fame for 
but a compel necessity of honour

upon my life and conscience a direct way 

to be a rascal 

it be a kind of rape too 
that keep you clear for where your will be compel 
though you yield up your body you be safe still 

thou be grow a learned bawd I ever look 
thy great sufficiency will break out 

you may 
you that be young and fair scorn we old creature 
but you must know my year ere you be wise lady 
and my experience too say the king love you 
say it be nothing else 

I marry wench now thou come to i 

do you think prince favour be such slight thing 
to fling away when you please there be young lady 
both fair and honourable that will leap to reach they 
and leap aloft too 

such be light enough 
I be no valter wench but can thou tell i 
though he be a king whether he be sound or no 
I will not give my youth up to infection 

as find as honour ought to be I think lady 
go to be wise I do not bid you try he 
but if he love you well and you neglect he 
your lord life hang on the hazard of it 
if you be so wilful proud 

thou speak to the point still

what be you why the same you be now a woman 
a virtuous woman and a noble woman 
touch at what be noble you become so 
have Lucrece ever be think of but for Tarquin

when she be ravish she be a reverent saint 
and do you think she yield not a little 
and have a kind of will to have be reravish 
believe it yes there be a thousand story 
of wondrous loyal woman that have slip 
but it have be on the ice of tender honour 
that keep they cool still to the world I think you be bless

I have hear report speak be a infinite pleasure 
almost above belief there be some lady 
and modest to the world too wondrous modest 
that have have the blessedness to try his body 
that I have hear proclaim he a new Hercules

there will be the danger 
you be but a young and tender lady 
although your mind be good yet your weak body 
at first encounter too to meet with one 
of his unconquered strength 

peace thou rude bawd

And wear thou in my bosom to betray i 
can year and impotence win nothing on thou

I do but tell you
