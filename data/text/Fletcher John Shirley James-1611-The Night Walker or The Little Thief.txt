walk up and down to find their weariness 
no soon have we measure with much toil 
one crooked path with hope to gain our freedom 
but it betray we to a new affliction 
what a strange mockery will man become 
short to all the creature 
o Maria 
if thou be dead why do thy shadow fright i I 
sure it be because I live be I but certain 
to meet thou in one grave and that our dust 
may have the privilege to mix in silence
