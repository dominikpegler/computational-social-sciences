


with Torches in their Hands, and Faggots on their Shoulders,
going to make Bonfires.


COme Boys! come! we'le make the Fire before Al∣derman
Trueman's door, he's an honest Cavalier.



Let him be as true as he will, we'le burn him for a
Roundhead, without he gives us some Drink; believe me Neigh∣bour,
I am so scorch'd up with running and bawling, I am all
  2
over as dry as a Kix, Heaven send some Fellow or other does
not mistake me for a dry Billet, and throw me on for Com∣pany.



The man's a Fool o'my Conscience; do'st think we
can want drink to day? There's a positive Order from the King
to make us all as Drunk as Lords, that we may give God
thanks for his happy Return to his Kingdoms.



Nay, I must needs say Neighbour, I always am most
devout after a sound Evenings Draught: But what Saints day
do you call this?



Why man, dost not know? 'Tis the Kings Birth and
Return.



Indeed I never heard of that Saint before; but if
he'le give us drink enough, he shall e'ne have my Prayers along
with the rest.



The truth on't is, I always thought your drinking Saints
had the least harm in them; so for my part, I'le go drink and
pray as long as I can stand.



But heark you me Neighbour, what did our King do
when he was abroad in strange Countries?



Do? Why what should he do but learn Manners and
Breeding! Oh he's the courteousest Gentleman; if you did but
see how he pulls off his Hat to the Ladies and Gentlewomen when
he walks in the Park, or comes into the City. There's Alder∣man
Softhead's Wife, and half a score more, are in love with
him so, they go constantly 3 or 4 times a Week to see him at
Dinner, and the King always sends some of his Nobles to see them
home, and that's a great Honour let me tell you, to their Husbands.



Ay, ay, Neighbour, you may talk of Honour as you
please, but I heard Alderman Doolittle say, there was no profit
in it; for besides the expence of entertaining these Gallants,
whether these fine sights do work on his Wives Fancy or no, I
can't tell: But whereas he was not us'd to have a Child once in
four or five years, he finds now he gets one or two every year.



Why truly Neighbour, since this Kings coming, I must
needs say, they have a very good Receipt at Court to help generati∣on.  3
I have heard some wise People say, his Highness is graci∣ously
resolved to communicate it publickly to all his Women
Subjects.



Nay, it will save our Citizens a great deal of Charge,
and their Wives a great deal of trouble of going to the Wa∣ters.



Why don't you come away ho! you stand talking of
Water, Water, and forget to make the Fire.



Ay, come, come away to the Bonfire, the Bonfire,
hallo Boys, hallo.








THou must Corinna use thy utmost power,
Thou must not leave one charm about thee Idle:

All sense of that which Fools call Modesty;
All nice reluctancy, and forc'd complyance,
Must now be laid aside; when ye retire
To unload the Treasures of your heap'd up Loves,

First throughly warm him with the sparkling Grape,

Which will provoke, and prompt his backward Fancy.
Then, as thou seest his quickned Spirits move,
And with new life and eagerness to dance
Through all the windings of his well-fill'd Veins:
Then dear Corinna let it be thy Care
To exert thy universal Stock of charms;

Let the soft Lanquets of thy wishing Eyes
Seem to upbraid his want of love and fondness:

Then throw thy snowy Arms about his Neck,
And draw him gently to thy panting bosom.

Storm all his Out-works with thy balmy Lips,
And pour whole Vollies of delicious kisses;


Let him ascend thy Alablaster Hills,
And thence survey thy pleasent fruitful dalleys:

But when by eager hast and heat of Travel,
He thirsts and seeks for thy delicious Fountain,

Then dear Corinna, then, capitulate;
His Birthright then he would not think too dear
To purchase one sound draught of cooling Love.





you cannot ask what I'le deny,
Your Highness's Interest and mine bear such relation,
I but oblige my self in serving you:
But whence do all these Doubts and Scruples rise,
Your fears of this same Bugbear Sanhedrim?

I have heard Androgynes in sport and pastime
Deride and Scoff at all their weak pretensions;
'Tis true ill natur'd Custom, he would say
(The long-lov'd Idol of the heedless crowd)
Has gave them liberty at his Command
To sit, petition, beg, or to propose;
But still the grant and sanction lyes in him;
So that in reality 'tis but meer form,
Since all they do is vain and null without him.



Ha! the Duke here, and in private parly with his
Brothers Mistresses! well, he's an unconscionable man, I'le say
that for him; there's hardly a day goes but he picks one Jewel
or other out of his Crown; and yet I'le be hang'd but he's bidding
Money now underhand for his Whores, though o'my Consci∣ence,
poor Androgynes had rather part with that, than these.
Well, he's a mild good-natur'd Prince, but is so unfortunately
taken up with these plaguy Women, that this Brother of his
has all the Administration of affairs in his hands; and I am afraid
grasps the Sceptre so fast, that the King upon occasion would find
it a hard matter to wring it out of them. I know this Caligula's
Nature to be Ambitious and Cruel, witness his early Intrigues
  5
to supplant his Brother, even before his Restauration; and though
by fatal experience to him we know Venus has sometimes the
ascendent over him too, yet those serious whispers between him
and these Ladies, seem to carry something more solid and im∣portant
than bare Amour: I must hearken.




'Tis true indeed Corinna, if the power
(Which he by great Prerogative does claim)
Of Negative Compliance with their Votes
Could quash and silence all their hot Proceedings,
So as they never durst attempt them more,
'Twere easie to induce Androgynes

To lend a careless Ear to their Proposals;
But then, these Obstinate Hungarians

(Like Eager Lobers at a weak Repulse)
Press on with vigorous Address and Zeal;
And like your sturdy Beggers in a Road,
Seem to petition and implore your Alms,
But in such surly manner do approach,
As shews their resolution to obtain
By force, what otherwise you would refuse.



I thought this Mungrel Brood of Sanhedrims,

Like Bastard Race of Cocks, had only dar'd
To mount the Battlements of their own Dunghils,
And thence proclaim their cholerick Dastard Threats;
But will they say you venture to draw out
And dare to face Royal Prerogative?

Your Highness must take care to have them cropt,
They may grow dangerous to your self and us;

Name but the Methods, and leave us to manage;
I think Androgynes will scarce deny us.





A delicate pert Bona Roba this; these Women have as
little Conscience as Lawyers, they'll take Fees I see, of all sides: But
who have we here? Oh! foh! I am sick of the sight of them;
  6
Here's Paulbrough and le Talbo, Caligula's two Confidents, and
dignified with the Titles of his Pimp and his Butcher; the two
Horse-leeches of the Court, the one sucks up the Reputation,
and the other the Blood of most of the honest People about it;
like Comets they carry a malignant Influence and Aspect, and are
ominous and destructive to all that have to do with them;
the one to shew that he had a Religion (which was very much
doubted) became a Convert to Paganism, and out of Gratitude
to his Master, relinquished his God: The other's a Native Pagan
of Teagueland, and consequently a Uillain by Birth; but want∣ing
Improvement, was recommended to the Duke, who by the
Gift of a cast Whore, and a Colonel's Commission, has qualified
him for his Service; so that when Poyson or Poynard, Halter or
Pistol are to be us'd, he's the Captain Commandant, and takes
care of the business. There will be nothing worth the hearing
now, and so farewel Duke.




Udsnouns, Sir, I beg your pardon for swearing; but
by Mahomet if you don't take some speedy course, we are all un∣done.




Why, prithee Paulbrough, what's the matter?



Why, the Council has received Information of our
Plot, and seem inclined unanimously to search into the bottom
of it.



This shall search some of their Hearts first.





Intriguo your Secretary, like a Fool and a Villain, has
confess'd a great many Points to Demophilus the Tribune.



Who was his Accuser?



That Uillain Pertinar, who to the Council has laid the
Minutes of our Consults open; who have sent their Orders for
Imprisoning those several Parties Pertinax accus'd,



Has he been bold to name our Royal Self?



The Villain bids Desiance to all Shame,
And points your Highness out as Principal!




Hell! Tortures! Death! Le Talbo, seek the Devil,
And force his Tongue to everlasting silence;


Let him no longer breath the open Air,
But stop his curst blaspheming Throat for ever;
Cut him to Atoms in the Face of day;
No time or place shall give the Fiend protection
Oh Villain!



you make me swear again; your Highness, I
hope, will lay aside this Passion for a while; consider first what's
proper to be done, and then doubt not the Execution.




This will put a plaguy stop to my former Designs; and
I'm afraid I shall be obliged to change my Measures; and well
if that will do too: This comes of Modesty in the Devils Name;
I have been gaping like a Ninny these twenty years, and vainly
thought to have had a Crown dropt into my Mouth! and have
hardly eat or slept with any satisfaction for thinking and dream∣ing
of Revenge upon these cursed Christians, and now at last
am like to be fairly fitted; that is, with a Gibbet sooner than a
Scepter, a Scaffold than a Throne: The truth on't is, we have
shewn 'em so many of our Experiments, that the Rogues have
grown industrious upon it, and are like to take our Trade out of
our Hands: A Body would have thought a Plot so closely laid,
and so unanimously carry'd on, could never have faild; why,
'twill make our old Friend B•elzebub turn Bankrupt, his Inven∣tion's
grown thred-bare, and we shall never be able to shew our
Faces again; unless (he pauses and shrugs) hold ha! by
Mahomet a good Thought that! (shrugs again and grins)Take
off Demophilus in the Bud! good! Dissolve the Sanhedrim;
good again: Disgrace, that is, swear counter to Pertinar, best
of all: ha, ha, ha Well, I see what it is to deal with Devils
of Honour; they promis'd I should be a King and I find me∣thinks
by Inspiration they'll be as good as their Words. Come
my good Friends come Paulbrough and Le Talbo, you are Men
of Sense, come, what Cure do you propose for these threatning
Evils?



Cure Sir nay, I believe my Distemper will
not last long. Axes and Halters are expert Physicians, they'll
quickly put me out of pain.



The truth on't is, I have been contriving a Counter∣Plot.



A Counter-Plot man! marry that would be to the pur∣pose:
prithee let's hear it.



Why I'le e'ne make hast and run out of my Wits, and
sure they'le ne're have the Conscience to suspect a madman for a
Plotter:



O' my Conscience they'l suspect none else.

'Slife, would any but a mad-man like this Paulborough, that had
a plentiful Fortune, and all things to his wish, that needed no
Favours, and might have fear'd no Frowns, that had sufficient
attendance, and might be free from dependance, would any
but a Mad-man, I say, after this have turned Plotter, and make
Sale of his Honour, his Estate, and his Conscience, to gain the
poor returns of an ill-grounded Friendship, or at best, the caresses
of a very weak Prince, and a more wicked man?




No, come Le Talbo fear nothing, I have a restorative
Cordial for us all.



Nay, if your Highness brings us off this once, we shall
make sure work i'fack next time, or else I'le give them leave to
make mummy of me.



Well then my Friends I'le tell you; I had been contriving
with these Ladies how to persuade Androgynes my Brother, to
declare himself a Pagan, but this Discovery of our Plot, has
also broke the Neck of that design for the present; so that I
have resolv'd on new measures, which nevertheless if they take,
will have the same effect as the former.



Udsbud, your Highness revives me.



In the first place then, Demophilus must be taken off;
which falls to your Lot Le Talbo, and to be done with speed:
if he lives to appear before the Sanhedrim we are all lost.



If he be mortal, your Highness need not fear him; if
ever He tell Tales it shall be in a Vision.



His Papers I'le secure, they shall never rise against us.



But this plaguy Sanhedrim, there is no way to secure
them too?



That, dear Corinna must thy Province be;
Gain but that point, and we are blest for ever;
Religion, Interest, and Safety too:
Persuade thy utmost vigilance and care;
Thou know'st their envious Malice to the self,

How they'd audaciously controul and check▪
That Bounty which my Royal Brother thinks
(As 'tis most true) too mean for thy great Merit.
Remember also what thou wilt deserve
From our most Holy Prophet, if by thee
The numerous Lives of all our trusty Pagans

Shall be redeem'd, which by the crafty malice
Of this insinuating Sanhedrim,

(If suffer'd to assemble and continue)
Will be expos'd and made a Sacrifice:
Such is their bruitish Rage and Cruelty,
It justly may be fear'd; (though Heaven forbid)

Their base Designs may even extend to thee;

Thine therefore, dear Corinna, be the Care
T' Address Androgynes with Art and Zeal;
All that thy Fears or Danger can suggest,
All that a Lover or a Friend can urge,
All that for Interest and safety too
Can be produc'd, must be alledg'd; and you

Dear Leonora, must not idly stand,
If Love or Friendship for Caligula

Can add to all thy natural Eloquence,
Thou must exert it now, for now's the crisis

Of my succeeding Fortunes:
Nor will • doubt, when you vouchsafe to bless,
Caligula will ever want Success.




Duty and Interest so well perswade,
All other Reasons might have well been spar'd;
And think we go with pleasure to obey,
When such strong Arguments do shew the way.





Farewel, Dear Punks, I'll be hang'd but they'll
go near to quarrel who shall oblige me most: Well, I will reward
them, I will be as just to them as they are to my Brother. These
Court Ladies, I find, study Politicks as much as Amours; Interest
is their grand Principle I see, and therefore they'll resolve to bow
to the strongest side: Crafty Gypsies! they find Androgynes
stands upon ticklish ground, his Rays grow short and dim, so
they naturally turn to the Rising Sun. Well, I must cherish
them till they have done my business, and then like an old Gar∣ment
I'll throw 'em aside.  Well now Le Talbo, there re∣mains
no more than to discredit Pertinax, and ridicule his Evi∣dence,
and then let them go whistle with their Plot. What
think you, is my Invention good? My witty Brother with his
fam'd Politicks will lag behind me perhaps.



Udoslife, if your Highness could teem but once in seven
years to such purpose as this, we might save the trouble of send∣ing
to the Mufti or the Sorbonne for new projects: Udsbud,
your Brother quoth al well, I'll say nothing, but I always
thought your Highness had a fruitful Brain.



Well Gentlemen, we must to our several Stations. Le
Talbo, you have not many spare hours; all Plots must have time
to grow and ripen, that at last they may pop out and be usher'd
in with as much seeming natural consequence as the dropping of
Mellow Fruit.



I shall present your Highness with a Scheme of my
Measures by to morrow Night, and in ten days you may expect
the Execution; and for Pertinax his business, I have a trusty
Troop of Myrmidons, whose Forlorn Hope of Mac's, Fitz's and
Dermot's (like the Giants at the Gates of Enchanted Castles)
will frighten your puny Knight-Errants, call'd Iuries, into a
ready Compliance with their Allegations.



That's right, Le Talbo, I have a strange love for those
Myrmydons, as you call them: If I had not a good opinion of
my Mother, I should mistrust one or other of them had a hand in
my Generation; I do strangely sympathize with them in their
Manners and Actions.



Odsountikins, they may be very useful to your Majesty,
both in the obtaining and keeping your Kingdoms; I always
love to stick close to a King when he has a good Army at his
Back; Sword and Pistol are unanswerable Arguments, if his High∣ness
do but rightly apply them.





May it please your Highness, his Majesty requires your
Presence in his Cabinet immediately.



What Company are with him?



Aristander, Demophilus, and one called Pertinar, just
claim'd admittance upon weighty business.



Curse on their bus'ness! but I'll interrupt them,
I'll try the Metal of their hardned Brows,
And like their Evil Genius, stare them into silence:

Le Talbo go, and mind the Grand Concern,
While I go quash these babling Fool's Pretensions.
Give your Attendance, Paulbrough, at Nine,
And then you may expect my further Orders.







Thus far Caligula, thou art safe and right,
All humane probability assures thee;
Thou hast laid a firm immovable Foundation,
Whereon to raise and build thy future greatness;

And now thou mayst with pleasure stand and gaze

And view the bulky product of thy Brain:
First by thy wily arts and stratagems
Thou hast deceiv'd and drawn Androgynes

To stand, and privately abett a Plot,

Chiefly design'd and aim'd against himself:
For though to propagate the Pagan Faith,
And Interest in the Realm of Hungary,

Be one main end of all thy Machinations;
Yet thy Ambition, prompted by Revenge,


Too plainly whispers to thy longing Heart,
That nothing but thy Brothers Life and Crown
Fill the desires of thy capacious Soul;
And though the rest may for the present please,
Yet these, and these alone compleat thy satisfaction:
Next draw the methods of thy well train'd thoughts,

Each necessary consequence that follows
Link after Link, as of a long wrought Chain,
To which at last the Diadem is fastned.
For first, Suppose our Plot should not succeed,
As this Discovery does ill presage;
It serves however to surprize and raise
The wondring Spirits of the clamorous Crowd,

Who tho by heedless Passions being hurry d,
Can never comprehend or reach the truth;
Yet will (like Childrens Bug-bears) from Idea's
Of monstrous, unaccountable Proceedings;
Then to keep up and heighten their just Fears,
I must prevail with poor Androgynes

Abruptly to Dissolve the Sanhedrim,
E're they can dive into the Mystery;
Thereby dividing equally between us
The Burthen of their Doubts and Jealousies,

And also cut that Gordian Knot of Love
Which long has kept him Monarch of their Hearts.
Thus by fomenting Heats and Jarrs between them,
I've time to con my long laid project over;
And when by my Encitements he has wrought
All that his Ease and Luxury durst venture,
Then, then's the Minute, dear Caligula,




Then, then to finish thy mysterious Projects;
Then by some gentle working Opiate
To lay his restive Soul in its eternal Slumber.
And surely after all this toil, 'tis just
Some suitable Reward attend thy merit.
Crowns but too meanly recompense the pain;
Usurpers suffer e're they can obtain.









THIS plaguy Demophilus! the Tribune, like a subtile
Lurcher, trapann'd me out of my strong Hold, and be∣tween
jest and earnest, decoy'd me into a plain Confession of all;
if I were but secure of him, I'd no more care for Pertinax's De∣positions,
than for the braying of an Ass.



The truth on't is, if he come in as a second Witness, it may
be dangerous; but let me see;  Our Society should not
want an expedient upon a case of necessity, one would thinks.



No, o'my Conseience; if there be Halter, Dagger or
Poyson to be got, you need not despair of healing a small Breach:
What a complication of Villanies these Plotters are forc'd to en∣gage
in? like Thieues, who when they have rob'd a Man of his
Mony, are many times forc'd to cut his Throat for fear of a Dis∣covery.
Ah poor Demophilus! there's an actum est of thee, I
fear, and what is worse, I stand like one that from an adjacent
Hill beholds a Shipwrack; yet the boisterous Singes bear so sierce
and high, that I dare not attempt to save thee.






Your Servant, good Intriguo; what down in the Mouth
Man? Come chear up, the Duke sent me to tell you, he'd take
care to release you speedily: Good lack, if it were my case, how
easily would I baffle that silly Rogue Pertinax! you shall see in a
little time how I'll ridicule all his Depositions: C'nad I have a
way with me, and let me tell you, that way shall make room
for another way, till at last, mark you me, there shall be nothing
in the way.



What Buffoon have we got here! Oh! cry a'mercy, this is
the State-Scribler, and Caligulas Journey-man Pamphleteer, the
  14Paper-Bully, that would set Rules to other People, and observe
none himself; that with some few Flowers of Rhetorick plai∣sters
over his Nonsense, and would ridicule the World into a va∣luable
opinion of it; that for the sake of a Pension has forsworn
telling truth, and was the first that ever made Lying a Pro∣fession.




Come prithee Nobbs, leave off jeasting for once, and tell
me, What does the World say of this Plot?



What Plot, Sir? what Plot? I tell you that in a little time
I'll make it as plain as if I writ with a Sun-Beam, that there was
not, is not, cannot, shall not be a Plot; and let me tell you,
Sir, I'll do it so artificially, so smoothly, that e'gad Sir, though you
be in it your self, when you read my Descants upon it, you shall
have much ado to believe it.



I wish to Mahomet thou couldst do this Feat before my
Trial comes on, it would save me a great deal of Trouble in
my Defence, and my Fears of a tender conscienc'd Jury.



Oh Sir, no; the Plot must be in a manner prov'd first, or
else you must know it would not be worth my while to con∣fute
it.



Oh! Devil! prov'd quoth he! I am like to be finely fit∣ted
then, I shall hanged as round as a Hoop.



What signifies that, as long as I prove there was no Plot
afterwards? That's the main Point.



Thou hast struck a plaguy Damp upon me: His Words
seem to be prophetick, and presage ill to me.




Though I cant suspect the Mercenary Jove of telling
truth, yet his Words were dark and ominous. (aside. Who
knows but our good Caligula, out of Revenge for his Confession,
and a desire to stop his Mouth for the future, may e'ne suffer him
to be trip'd over, and so make sure of one? I know his Cruelty
and ingratitude will not let him stick at any thing that may seem
to advance his Designs.




Pish, prithee Intriguo, thou art more a Man than to be dis∣gruntled
at my Words; thou knowest 'tis my way, I make a
Jest of every thing; I had once a design to ridicule the Whole
  15
Duty of Man, and Practice of Piety; and egad if I had gone on
with it, I'd have made them as meer Banters as the Seven Wise
Masters, or Tom Thumb.



Why but Nobbs, we Pagans pretend to a little Conscience;
Hast thou none at all?



Pugh! we Authors have no more Conscience than Physiti-ans
or Lawyers, we write for our Fee, and let the Causes justle as
they please: There's only this peculiar Knowledge requisite in an
Author, that is, to know who and who's together, and which side
is uppermost. I have been tumbled to and fro, and toss'd up
and down, yet still have been so happy as to light on my feet
like a Cat: About forty years ago I was Fidler in Ordinary to
the Usurper, and then took up with Ballads and small Sonnets in
his Praise and Vindication; then when the King came in, I only
chang'd Masters, and wriggled my self into the News-Office; and
quickly perceiving how the World went, I fell a work on po∣litical
Observations, and by a sort of Jack-pudding Wit, peculiar
to me, e'gad I made many a counterfeit piece of Sense pass for
currant Ingenuity.



A very good Summary of his Life; what a great deal of
pains he has taken to prove himself a Fool and a Rakeshame?




Pray Mahomet I fall on my Feet, as you call it, for I am on
a plaguy Precipice.



Oh! alas you need not fear, the Duke will remember you, you
know he is always true to his Word: Well, I hope to see thee
abroad very speedily, we must crack a Pint together; the worst
on't is, thou wants air here.



His Worship and you may have air enough one day; I
am mistaken in my Politicks if I don't in time see you both hang
in the open Air.




Well honest Nobbs, thou must let me see thee sometimes,
and in the mean time give my humble Duty to my Master Ca∣ligula.



I shall be your faithful Servant, and so farewel dear In∣trigo.





An excellent Fellow this for our purpose, he neither
  16
wants Words nor Impudence, and those are two good Quali∣ties
to engage with Plot Catchers, Seignior Intriguo.



Ay, as he said, when the Plot is half prov'd or more, he
will be a proper Man to amuse the World, and banter them into
a disbelief of it; but in the mean time 'twill lie hard on me, if
there be enough prov'd to condemn me; for if I be hang'd for
a tryal of skill, you know it will be but little satisfaction to me
whether it be proved or no afterwards.



Oh but Seignior Intriguo, there's the Merit of the Cause,
and the advantage of Mother Church, which ought to supersede
all other Considerations whatever.



Why truly Father, the thought of an Halter brings many
Scruples into my Head; and upon a strict examination, I do not
find that I have liv'd so much a Saint, as to have Courage to die
a Martyr.



By Mahomet this Fellows Cowardize will undo us and the
Cause; Udslife! we must find some expedient to stop his tatling.




So, here's like to be more work; did you ever hear
such unreasonable Devils? they grumble at the Fellow, because
he scruples to hang out of complaisance.




Prithee Intrigno, what needst thou fear? Demophilus, who
is the greatest Evidence, will be taken off, the Duke has given
Orders about it already, and we are preparing counter-Evidence
to discredit Pertinax: Besides, if matters come to the worst, the
Duke has a Pardon ready for you: All therefore that lies upon
you is, to be silent; for upon the least voluntary Discovery yo're
a dead Man on all sides.



Well 'tis in vain to question and dispute
With them whose power and will are absolute:
I've serv'd my Master with a just regard,
'Tis left to Time to witness my Reward.














COme, pray my Lord, this is a Day of joy,

And should be wholly sacrific'd to pleasure.


A Day, which like some lucky cast at Dice,

Gave back with Interest all my lost Dominions.
Has not the meanest of my Subjects leave
To revel and disport themselves to day
To drink, and to congratulate my Return,

And pay their Vows to Heaven for my Safety?
And can you grudge that I should be partaker
Of Blessings, which alone seem pointed out
By bounteous Providence for my Enjoyment?

Come prethee, cease this noise of Plots and Tricks,

Hatch'd only in the Brain of some well-meaning Zealot,

Who, to exert his love, has form'd Idea's
Of things he vainly fears, and all compos'd
Of dissonant Improbabilities.

Fresh, young, and hitherto untouch'd? sayst thou, I'le be ready

Paulbrough.] It makes a Crown plaguy heavy and uneasie to
have such a Company of Attendants hanging at it continually.



Uds bodikims! she's the dearest plump Creature as ever
your Majesty saw; she made my old blood trickle, trickle, like a
Snow-ball in the Sun; I was at the hardest task in the World
to keep nature within bounds, but only respect to your Majesties
wants went a great way with me.



His wants, quoth he! yes, his Majesty wants a Mistress,
as a rich Miser wants Mony; that is, he'le never be satisfy'd till
  18
he has enjoy'd the whole Sex; if he holds on for seven years
longer, we shall have a new stock of Nobles of his own beget∣ting,
he'le quickly have a House of Peers at least to his own
mind: and yet, poor Man, he has very bad Fortune in the
choice of his Ladies; I'le be hang'd but this fine thing they talk
of is some cast Wench of this Lechers, and to save Charges, he
recommends her to the King for preferment. Well! this King
of our's, say what he will, must be a Pagan in his heart, he's
such a plaguy admirer of Reliques. But was ever Prince so be∣sotted
and bigotted to Effeminacy and Pleasures, as to neglect
all the necessary and weighty Affairs of this Kingdom, nay, even
the Safety of his Life, which is so evidently prov'd to be con∣spir'd
against by his goodly Brother the Duke, to neglect all for
that trifling Gugaw Woman! Heavens reform him!



If less than th' hazard of your Sacred Person
Together with the Vniversal ruin

Of our Religion, Laws, and Lives provok'd us
Now to implore your diligence and care
In time to quell this many headed Monster,

Whose Jaws are stretch'd and ready to devour us,
We might be tax'd of importunity
And bold intrusion on your Royal-Secrets;

But since 'tis prov'd the Net's already laid,
And waits but an unwary foot to tread it;
Since the whole Scheme of Uillanies unheard of,

To burn, destroy, and to depopulate;

Since in the Hurry of this wish'd confusion
'Tis plainly prov'd, and here demonstrated,

Your Royal Self is singly pointed out
To fall an undistinguish'd Victim to their Rage,
Believe it the Effect of duteous Zeal,

When we thus beg your Majesties Observance.

Demophilus can shew the Depositions.




My Lord, these Arguments produc'd by you
May well be look'd upon as innocent,
Proceeding from your well known Loyalty;



But yet, my Lord, we should advance with Prudence,
And not lash out with Prejudice and Passion:
The proofs of this fam'd Plot produc'd, are known

Even by the King to be both weak and frivolous.




Yes, yes, the Proofs by him are too well known:
Heaven grant I be not made a proof of it.




The Evidence is mean and pitiful,
So much of Rascal in his Looks appears,
It seems improbable, that men of sense
(And Fools could n'ere pretend to manage it)
Would e're intrust that Villain with the Secret.



My Lord, when Villanies, like these, are first projected,
Can we expect that Honesty is pitch'd on
As a fit Quality for th'execution?

Ruffians and Villains are chosen out on purpose
As learn'd and knowing in these Deeds of Darkness:
Beside, there's such a natural Complication

Of black Designs alledg'd by Pertinax,

As is beyond the Art of Man to feign.


Intriguo's Letters plainly do evince
The Mufti and the Pagans resolutions
T'eradicate the Christian Interest hence;
(Call'd by the Name of Northern Heresie.)
His Letters will be read.



But thou shalt never
Live to produce them, or stand the Test against him.
And I shall give an account of your Friend's

Civil Reflections upon my Master; the Duke will not be
Long in his Debt, I'le secure him.




This Count Paulbrough's muttering to himself does not
hode well, I hope he has not the Art of Conjuring, though I
think we need not fear his raising any thing worse than him∣self.



The Mufti and Caligula's Designs
To advance the Pagan Interest in my Kingdoms
I partly guess, and easily believe;


And if without the hazard of my Pleasures

(As hath been promis'd) it were brought about,
I should not care to wink at their Endeavours:
Nay, I already have indulg'd them so,
That they have shar'd my Favours to the Publick,
And undisturb'd, have liv'd with equal freedom;
And sure their black Ingratitude could never,
After these gracious Condescensions,
Leave them so destitute of all good Morals,

So base, ungenerous, and perjur'd too,
As to conspire and plot my Death and Ruin?
My Brother too! It cannot be!     




Udsountikins! what can be the meaning of this musing
and thinking? I have heard the Duke my Master say, he had
rather have to do with half an hundred jolly, smirking, plump
Fellows, than with one pale-fac'd lean plodding Mortal, they are
always hatching Mischief, with a plague to 'em; this Rule may
hold (saving in his Majesties Presence) now, for ought I know;
His Highness looks very demure, I must find out a way to break
the Charm:


Paper in his hand, and whispers the King.]
Sir! Sir! your Majesty does not consider the time's past, and
the dear little Angel has been expecting us with impatience. Well!
'tis a rare thing to be King, they need not stand whining and
pining for love, 'tis but look and like and the Business is done.



Then she's a dear coming thing, Paulbrough; 'tis true, I
hate a formal siege, where a body must wast good part of ones
Ammunition before one can gain the Fort; I am clearly for one
vigorous Assault, and love that my Enemy should trust my Ge∣nerosity,
and Surrender at Discretion. Well, Aristander and
Demophilus, we commend your Loyal Care, and will consider of
your Address. Come, lead the way Paulbrough.



Demophilus, Attendants; manet Re∣marquo
solus.







How this old Serpent Paulbrough tempts the good easie
natur'd Prince; he know's his weak side, and wo'nt give him a
minutes time to recall an Errour. Here's plotting and counter∣plotting
of all hands, but Heaven knows on whom the Burthen
will light! This Duke of ours is as busie as a Bee in Spring,
though o'my Conscience he makes more Gall than Honey; he
has some dark deep design on foot, which I must watch and
unravel. Well, though his Brother be not over-cordial in his
Affections to his People, yet of two Evils the least is to be
chosen.

Time may perhaps mend and reclaim the first,
But under This we are for ever Curst.
Exit Rem.







LOok ye here Gentlemen, I always took ye for the Dukes
very good Friends, and I can assure you, he speaks ve∣ry
Kindly of you.



Nay, I must needs say he is a very good Pay-master, I
have been Cut-throat in Ordinary to him these many years, and
I cannot say he ows me a farthing: Let the World say what they
will, I'le e'ne praise the Bridge I go over.



Nay, nay, I know his Highness as well as you, I had
bargain'd with him about a small Job once, but things did not
hit, so we were forc'd to give it over. But pray Sir, let us know
how many there are to be dispatch'd?



Why, truly Sirs, you will have more work than you can
turn your hands to in a little time; but at present I think one
will do our Business.








I hop'd we should have had every one his man at least.
  22
Good lack! all this plotting and but one Throat to be cut! Bro∣ther,
we must ask high, or we shall never be able to live at this
rate: (aside.) Pray Sir, is he old or young? for there is a great
difference in Throats, and we must proportion our Wages ac∣cording
to the Difficulty of the Work: Oh! there are some
Throats as tough as Whit-leather.



These are pure Rogues indeed, they talk as formally of
cutting Throats as if they had a Charter for their Profession; 'tis
a Regular Vocation with them: (aside.) I'le tell you Sirs in
short, there is a diminutive old paultry Fellow, whom for no less
Considerations than conspiring against the Dukes Life and Ho∣nour,
and endeavouring to render the honest Pagans of Hunga∣ry
Traitours, horrid Traitours and Plotters against the King's
Life and his Highness, I would willingly have decently laid aside.



Ay, all the reason in the World, my very Conscience
rises at him; Oh! Villain! Did you ever hear of such a wicked
Fellow? What, Sir, will be the Purchase you know what I
mean, how much Sir? how much? You know we always make
sure work, Five hundred pounds Brother is but a small matter
considering 



But considering the Gentleman promiseth we shall have
the rest of his Highness's Work, let him drop the other Hun∣dred,
and here's Don Diego that shall do his Business.



Vdsniggs, five hundred pounds!(He pulls out a Dagger.)
hold (He pauses.) e'gad, I have an itching desire to do it my self.
(Aside.) Come Friend, I was in good hopes, when thou wer't
talking of Conscience, thou wouldst have been reasonable, and
have had some respect to the Cause, I guess you are all Pagans
your selves.



Truly, Sir, we have no Religion but our Trade, and
we are always of that side that bids most mony.



Ha! I have brought my self into a fine Praemunire then
e'gad; I find if I am out-bid, I may have my own Throat cut:
What a plaguy thing it is to be such a cowardly Dog as I am?
If I could have found in my heart to have undertaken this my
self, I might have been clear of all this danger, and have had
  23Five hundred pound in my Pocket. Well, I am in too far, and
must go thorough with them. (Aside.) Well, Gentlemen,
considering my Master has a kindness for you, I'le not be a nig∣gard
of his mony; here's an hundred and fifty Pieces in hand, which
shall be made up Five hundred within three days after you have
done your Business. And now I'le tell you the person, you can∣not
but know him, 'tis Sir Demophilus the Tribune, that lives
between Alba Regalis and the Queens Palace.



Oh lau! is it he? an ugly cross-grain'd old Rogue, our old
Persecutor: Know him, quoth he? Ay marry, and good reason,
I had cut his Throat long ago, if I could have light of a Chap∣man,
for 'tis against our Oath to do it gratis. If a man had
been bread all his life time to some honest Vocation, suppose
Picking of Pockets, &c. yet this unconscionable Fellow, if he
could catch him, would punish him severely; and as I take it,
that's clearly against the Statute: I'le engage your Business done
Sir.



And pray, assoon as may be.



'Tis yet early, and I know his House, and we'le dog
him, if it be possible, this very day.



One thing I had forgot, if you can decoy him into the
Water gate, we can order matters so as to have his Body at
our disposal. You had best dispatch, the Sun grows high.



Before to morrow's dawn we may give you a good ac∣count
of him; till then, Sir, Farewel.




Manet Le Talbo solus.



I think I am now in a hopeful way of thriving; Secrets
of this importance cannot but recommend me in a peculiar man∣ner
to the Dukes favour; and as he Rises (which, as far as I
can gather, will not be deferred long) to be sure I shall be mo∣ving
and climbing too, and when I am out of their reach, what
care I for a company of conscientious Fools prattle? Well, for my
part, I am none of those hot-headed Fools that would venture
my Life, and a good Pension, for a few vain Words and Babble;
When a Man calls me Coward, I cry his Humble Servants. Let a∣nother
call me Cuckold, Pimp, Varlet, or Cut-throat, I laugh in
  24
his face, and tell him he Jeasts, and we are as good Friends a∣gain
as ever; and let other men take their own Measures as they
please, I am sure 'twas these good Qualities that made me a Fa∣vourite:
Here's Demophilus the Tribune would needs be offici∣ous
forsooth, and see what he'le get by it: And there's half a
dozen more will have their Rewards in good time, I'le warrant
them.

They are by Prudence and Discretion lead,
Who most the Paths of Safety strive to tread:
True Courage, needless danger most doe's fly,
And none but Fools can covet misery.
Finis Actus Secundi.









PRithee Sullen, thou art always so impatient and drow∣sie,
Udszookers, dost think to get thy Living by
snoring? Come, come, let me tell you, this will be a comforta∣ble
Jobb, and we ought not to grudge our Pains.



Why, I don't know Brother Meager what's the matter
with me to night, I am neither drowsie nor impatient, but I
have a sort of an unusual Qualm come over me: I did not un∣derstand
this Le Talbo's Reason for taking off this Demophilus;
Prethee what dost thou think it?



Nay, as for his Reason, I have nothing to do with it;
if it be a false one, let him look to it, I am innocent. I am sure
an hundred and fifty hard solid pieces of Gold carry reason e∣nough
to excuse me.



Why then, is there no point of Honour or Conscience
to be observ'd in our Trade, Meager?



Ha-Ha-Ha- thou mak'st me laugh in good earnest;
Honour and Conscience, quoth he! Yes, yes, as much as in U∣surers
and Bankrupts, who when they have cheated and ruin'd
the unwary young Prodigals, cast up their Eyes in a transport,
and pretend to give God thanks for their good Fortune, my
Pocket's the Rule of my Conscience.



But I would very fain know what this Demophilus has
done.



Thou art a meer Novice, I see, never ask what he has
done, but how much we are to receive. This plaguy Rawbone
sure has got him, he stays so long; be sure you observe your Cue,
Sullen.



Well! Well! Qualms never continue long with me,
a thin Purse, and an empty Belly always cure my Melancholy.






Ha! That's the sign! Sullen, Sullen, make ready, our
Game is drawing nigh.











Where's Meager? Sontikins we have him Boys, he's
within forty Paces, and alone, to our wishes; if we miss him
now, I'le despair of him for ever. Be sure keep your Post, and be
exactly ready; stand drawn, for fear of losing time: for rather
than fail we must chop him down any how.



While Demophilus walks soberly along, Rawbone, just as he is
passing the Water-gate, pops out upon him; in the mean time
Sullen and Meager are just seen within the Scenes with their
Swords drawn, clashing together as in a real quarrel.


For Heavens sake, Sir! as you are a Christian and a Gen∣tleman,
give your Assistance to part a couple of Friends, who
are just now engaging in a quarrel within the Gate.



Alack! withal my heart, Sir.(He turns to the Scene, and
see's them fighting.) Come, pray Gentlemen, do'nt murther one
  26

and while he is speaking, pusheth him violently forward, and presently
the other two lay hold on him, and drag him within the Scene.] Slife!
who's that? what do you mean? Sir! Oh! Villains, un∣hand me!
what? will you mu murther me?



We'le only cut your throat, or so, Sir. Stop his mouth
Rawbone, and bring him to the Rales.



Shall we strangle or run him through?



Oh! Villains! O my Go God! Gent lemen have
you   no pi pi ty! Oh! spa 
m li ife.



He's safe enough; let's consider, if we wound him, the
Blood will be seen.



No, no I'le twist his Neck, or strangle him.



Go Go d re receive my Soul!




So, that Groan carryd him off: he'le trouble himself
no more with Plots, or Depositions, I'le warrant him.



I can but laugh to think how sneakingly he'le look to
morrow when he finds his Neck broke: but what shall we do with
him, ho?



Why, let's tye a good weight to him, and throw him
into the River.



No, no, that's against our Orders. We'le carry him
into the adjoyning Mosque, till we know Dukes farther Re∣solutions;
A murrain on't; our Business is so soon over! Two or
three such Jobbs would set me afloat bravely.



Never fear Boys; now the Dukes hand is in, he'le never
do his Business by halves; they whisper at Court that the young
Prince Damasippus and he have had a brush lately, and that
Count Aristander and several other Nobles are taken notice of
for their Zeal in the Discovery of this Plot; we can never fail
of a good Harvest where there is so much Seed sown.



Well, well, we'le talk of this another time; let's away
with the Body.



Ay, come hoist.(They take up the Body of Demophilus
and carry him within the Scenes.)



Hey ho, a Tribune's as, heavy as three other People.



Udsbud, you may be sure he can't be very light, when
he has the whole Plot in his Belly.











ALready! Le Talbo, and so dexterously! give the honest
Villains Fifty Pieces more to drink my Health; they
deserve it: How all things prosper with me! Well, these Jebusites
of mine are great Politicians, they have blown the Plot up root
and branch! But what did he say before he dy'd?



Why, they say he kept a great pother about his Sins, and
begg'd for a little time to prepare himself: but 



He was a silly man to be unprovided; for he might have
read his Destiny from the Minute of his Discovery. I hope some
others will take Example by him; my Quiver is not empty yet.



Nor will be, while there's a good man in the Kingdom left.
(aside.
Vnless kind Heavens in pity do look down▪
And bar thy prospect to the Imperial Crown;
Thence all our Woes and Miseries proceed,
Thy heart's the Nest where all our Mischiefs breed.

Hungaria ne're expects a happy Day
Till thou prove kind, and take thy self away.




These Cut-throats Arguments are very persuasive, they
make a man a Convert in a moment: If your Highness did but
see how demurely he looks, a body would not think he knew any
thing of the matter.



Good Heavens! were there ever such hardned Villains!
Murther is a downright Diversion with them, as if they kill'd a man
only for the opportunity of breaking a Jeast: Sure this will not
go long unpunish'd.




But as to your Disposal of him, Sir.



I have already consulted it, and sent my Orders for the
Execution. I want some body to form some plausible Argu∣ments
that he kill'd himself, for so it is given out.





Udslife! how Providence throws every thing in your
Highness's Mouth? here's the fittest Fellow alive for it.



Thou art in the right; I have not seen the Blade these
ten days, whith made me forget him. How now Nobbs, what
thou art not concern'd in this strange Plot, art thou? Thou hast
been absent so long, a body would suspect thee.



Yes efack, it is strange indeed, that there should be
such abundance of Talk, and Nothing to be seen of it: But as my
Brother Bays ingeniously says,
Plots, true or false, are necessary things
To set up Commonwealths, and pull down Kings.
Well, I'le lay a Groat I fit those Roguy Whiggs with Invention
one of these days, they will not be quiet till I have mauld 'em.
But I pray did your Highness hear the News?



No: what News prithee, Nobbs?



Why, there's an Hue and Cry after Demophilus the Tri∣bune,
for hanging himself.



Hanging himself, man! is it true?



True, I'le warrant, for he can't be found high nor low.



Why, how do'st know he has hang'd himself then?



Why, a'nt please your Highness, I prove in thus: None
but Madmen and Fools hang themselves; but Demophilus was a
Madman and a Fool, therefore he hang'd himself. Ha ha ha,
there's an Argument off-hand egad, I'le have it in my next Ob∣servator
egad, and you shall see how the grave Citts will hammer
upon it: This is only to shew your Highness how an ingenious
Man may baffle this dull plodding World egad: But the plain truth
on't is, I do hear it whisper'd about that he has made away with
himself, but as yet I know no particulars.





My Lord, Count Paulbrough sends your Highness word,
  29
that Demophilus the Tribune was this Morning sound run thorow
the Body with his own Sword near Pyramose-Hill.





Ha! 'tis strange! though indeed I guess'd he would come
to some such end; he was an ill man.



Nay, if thou hadst been either ignorant or Innocent, he
had not yet come to his end. Oh! Vengeance! Vengeance!



Now, though the matter is plain, that he was his own
Executioner, yet 'tis forty to one but some malicious Tongue
will throw it upon others: Nay, they have been bold in some
things, not to spare even our Royal self.



Pish, pish, 'tis as plain as the Sun, and the Reason for
it prevent all dispute; for either there was a Plot, or there was not:
If there was a Plot, he was afraid the Sanhedrim would have
brought him in for a Snack for not discovering it sooner; and let
me tell you, a man had as good be half hang'd as be brought be∣fore
a House of Commons; ergo, He was afraid, and so forth. And
if there was no plot, as to be sure there is not, why then, mark
you me, there's Scandalium Magnatum, and a hundred other
Plagues, that let me be hang'd, I think he took the best way to
remove himself by a Habeas Corpus; and if this be not demon∣stration,
I'le be bound to write Ballads as long as I live; and
there's somthing for Observator again.



Such as these will do Nobbs: and I would have thee be
speedy, and fall on first, to prevent all others babbling.



Nay, let me be hang'd, an't please your Highness, but
you have hit upon my way to an hairs breadth; for when there is
any Matter of Consequence likely to be disputed, then what do
me I, mark you me, but espouse the Court Curse to be sure, right
or wrong; and then do I, in a bantering sort of way, insinuate and
introduce all the Arguments that the other side can possibly be
suppos'd to bring, and by ridiculing some, and waving the rest,
egad I leave them bustling and scratching their Heads to find out
new Matter; for efack, if they come once to Repetition, whip I
slave 'em like School-boys; so that egad in Conclusion I'le prove
that this Sir Demophilus feloniously laid violent hands upon him∣himself,
and no body shall dare to contradict it: and so I hum∣bly
bid your Highness Farewel.







Well, Now Le Talbo, we are past the worst,
We have shot that dangerous Gulf that threatned us.
Now with expanded Sails we'le gently glide
Through the calm Sea of Safety and of Pleasure.
In this Demophilus alone did lye
Our cursed Christians Hopes, and all our Fears.
His Virtue, Age, Religion, Piety,
If e're he had fac'd the haughty Sanhedeim

Had given him credit there beyond Exception.
His urgent Testimony, without doubt,
Back'd with the Circumstance of Things and Persons,

Intriguo's Letters, Pertinax his Oaths,
Had carry'd such a prevailing Influence
Over the too inclining Sanhedrim,

As would have surely ruin'd us for ever.
But he is gone Le Tal.

What then do's still remain
A stop to all your glorious Resolutions?



None but what Time and moderate Industry
Will with a kind of natural Ease wear off.
This, my Le Talbo, was necessity,
What common Nature did persuade me to;
(Self-preservation all men teach and practise)
But now Ambition and Revenge succeeds,
(The darling Passions of all High-born Souls
And whisper to my longing listning Soul
The dazeling Glories of a glittering Crown.

Now, my great Genius crys, now is the time
In which, Caligula, thy Suffering Friends
Expect thee as their Great Deliverer,

Why should'st thou wait the heavy tedious motion
Of thy Lethargick Brother, who, whilst thou
Tir'st out thy Active Soul with Care and Zeal
To mould the Embryo's of thy deep laid Projects,
And warm them into Life and wish'd Perfection;


Supinely wanders through the ambiguous Maze
Of Love and Ease and wanton Luxury,
Careless of Dangers, yet of all afraid;
To bear unfit, yet still creating trouble;
Why shouldst thou thus weigh down thy yielding shoulders,
Which serve to prop and hold the tottering State
Whilst he drills out a dull inglorious Ease,

And yet shares all the Profits, all the Pleasures?
No, no Caligula, this must not be;
This dull delay, this tedious lukewarm Zeal,
Do's ill agree with all thy vast Designs:
If thou resolv'st to tast this Golden Fruit,

Now, now's the time to make thy fit approaches;
Now whilst the careless Guardian-Dragon's sleeping.
Le Talbo.







I Love my Brother, I think.



Your Brother, Sir! alack, good Prince, so do I, and every
honest body, a meek well-natur'd Kind as ever was known. But
that ▪



But what, Le Talbo! it seems he is not so good, but thou
hast an Exception for him.



I humbly ask yor Highness's Pardon; it was ill manners
in me to make an Exception.



What was't, Le Talbo? sure thou may'st speak to me with
freedom.



Good lack, Sir, I meant nothing but that, as all other
men, he has some few small failings.



Nay, He is not an Angel, I wish to Heaven he was.



Good lack! how my wishes jump with your Highness; I
have wish'd so many a time; Good Prince! he deserves to be
one; this world is not worthy of him.



Yet he cannot find in his heart to leave it; he is in love
with his Life, as bad Poets are with their Verses, and gives us the
tedious Repetition of it every day.



Nay, the worst thing I like in him is, he won't take your
Highness's good Advice.



He is like the Dog in the Manger, that will neither eat
the Hay himself, nor suffer the Horse.



Nay, now your Highness gives me leave, I will speak;
He is neither true Pagan, nor Christian, but a meer Trimmer be∣tween
both, and foments a Division between both Parties, meerly
to stave off their Designs against himself.



He has often promis'd, and as often deceiv'd me, and what
is worse, I fear will never perform: Therefore, Le Talbo, I have
resolv'd to change my measures, and take the shortest way to the
accomplishment of my Designs.



And your Highness is much in the right; I am for falling
too, without the formality of a long Grace; I hate waiting.



But yet some little time must be allow'd,
That all things may be ready for his Journey.

All that his easie Nature can be drawn to
Must be perform'd before you let him part;
He must the Ground and great Foundations lay
Whereon your future Buildings must be rais'd;

Charters, and Quo Warranto's, Dispensations
Must be begun and entred on by him:

The Plot discouraged, hiss'd, and out of doors,
Or burnt; from whose engendring Ashes must
An Infant monstrous Phenix Plot arise.
Some hot bold plodding Heads too must be lopp'd
For diving into your mysterious Secrets,
And fall thereby a weighty Sacrifice

To past Resentments, as to future Fears.

When this, and more, from thee Androgynes,

Has been obtain'd (whereby will be allay'd,
Perhaps diverted from his guilty self
The Odium, which such black Miscarriages
Alas! will too too surely bring upon thee)
Then like some useless old unfashion'd Garment
Thou art thrown aside, despis'd, unpity'd, laugh'd at.







Udsbud, an't please your Highness, there's more bad
News; 'Sountikins, I sweat for fear.



Thou never bring'st any good I think, what's the matter
now?



Why, Udsbud, Intriguo is undone, quite undone; he has
been try'd and found Guilty of a plaguy Pagan Plot, in the Devils
Name, and the Sanhedrim have Petition'd to have him Executed off
hand.



I did not care for all that, so I had but his Tongue secure, a
fearful babling Dog; but I have taken care to have him fitted.
Good Services may sometimes want regard,
But bad ones seldom fail of their reward.











NO Reprieve come! 'tis impossible!



'Tis true, and you have but two hours to pre∣pare
your self for Death.



Good lack, the Duke promised I should have it early, and
without fail.



Nay, nay, and if he promised it, you need not scru∣ple
it; I wish I had a good security for my Life.



However, let the worst betide, I can thank my
Stars, I die in a good Cause.



But for the present Father, I have a strange
  34
inclination to live in a good one; vengeance on it, I never
lik'd this desperate way of maintaining a Cause as we call it.



Sir, Let me tell you my Sentiments clearly, you have
but a very short time to consider of the great Journey you are going
to take: I advise you therefore to improve it to advantage, if a
Reprieve comes at last, you are still the same, if not (which may be
doubted) you cannot but be doubly griev'd, as doubly disappointed.



And art thou then Intriguo thus deluded?
Are thus thy blooming hopes so Swiftly vanish'd?
Are thus thy faithful Services repaid?
And all thy care and hearty Zeal requited?
'S'Death! shall I tamely, fall a Sacrifice
To the designs of an ungrateful Master?
Shall I in guilty Silence chose to dye;

When his bear speaking might preserve my Life?
Or like some Novice, when the Rooking Gamester,

By Subtile Cheating Arts, has drain'd his Pocket;
Stand both the Ridicule and Jest of my Imposers.
Hast not thou yet, Intriguo, in thy power,

To pay the mighty Debt exacted on thee?
Would not the willing Sanhedrim vouchsafe to hear;
And praise, and save thee for thy just Discovery.

Ah! yes they would But now the Brazen head,
Has doom'd thee lost for ever; Time is past.

And like the unwary Passenger, whose way,
Leads o're the dry deserted Strand, thou didst.

Delay the lucky minute of thy passage,
Staying, alas; till the returning Waves,
O're took, surrounded, grasp'd and overwelm'd thee.



Ha! Nobs here; nay, then, perhaps, I may have wrong'd my
Master: He did not hear me, I hope.
(Aside.)


Siegnior Intriguo, his Royal Highness the Duke, has sent 



A Reprieve, or Pardon? Speak my good Angel; Has my just
Master thought me worthy of his Remembrance? Good Prince,
I did not doubt his Mercy; but yo know the very Apprehen∣sions
of Death, do strangely perplex a man: But prithee, dear
Nobs, let's fee my last Comfort; my Hopes, my Joy; dear lack,
how strangely I am altered in a moment; well, I vow, I was very
melancholy, till I saw you, thou art born under a lucky Pla∣net,
thou alwaies bring'st good Tidings with thee. Come let me see it; is it a clear Pardon, or a Reprieve for pleasure.



A clear downright Pardon, an absolute Acquittance, for all
Debts, Dues, and Demands, &c. That you shall never be trou∣bled
for any thing of Plot or Plotting again, while you breath.



Look yo here now, good lack, what an ungrateful Villain
was I, to accuse so good a Master: Well, I could find in my Heart
to Hang my self for pure spite.
(Aside.
But come, a murrain on it, we'll let that alone till another time;
and now, dear Nobs, let me hug thee, 'fack I can crack a Pint
now with some comfort (They Embrace) with thee, and 'fack we
will have it too. Come, Mr. Keeper, give Orders for an hearty
Bottle; come, a Fart of Hanging now, I have got a Pardon, a Par∣don,
Boy (He leaps about.



Mr. Nobs, if you have brought Seigniour Intriguo's Pardon,
you would do him a kindness to produce it: for my Warrant
runs for Executon, this Morning at Ten of the Clock, and you
see by my Watch the time is near expired.



Ay, ay, come produceit; these Keepers are so Sawey, when
they have a Man in their Power. Sir, The Duke may remember
your Malapartness.



Sir, I must remember my Business, and if I mistake not,
your Worship will be part of it to day.




Heark you Siegniour, you cannot imagine what
He takes In∣triguo
aside.

a difficulty the Duke met with, before he could
obtain it; for you must understand the Sanhedrim
Petition'd and made a terrible Pother to have you Executed off hand;
nay, the very Rabble were gathering and threatned to pull you
out themselves; so that upon mature deliberation, it was thought
  36
sit, and concluded, bewteen the King and Duke, mark you me,
that you should for Meer Formality, and to asswage the grow∣ing
Fury of the People, that you should, I say, be drawn to the
place of Execution, and then Sir 'gad, I can but laugh at the Jest,
mark you me, just as they expect to see you Dangle, whip,
rush me, I, or some Body else in, no matter who, with the Re∣prieve,
though at the same time, we must be forc'd to make a for∣mal
Excuse, that you are to be Examin'd, or so, again, in Council,
before you Die; and so Sir, as I told you, under that Delusion,
egad, we whisk you away, and so give them the Slip for ever.



Oh! ye Devil, lost! lost! ruin'd, 
and undone for ever! Drawn to the place of Execution, quoth he,
ay, and Hang'd at the place of Execution; What a Devil should I
do there else?



Why, this Nobs, Brother, is the Miracle of his time; what
a Feteh was there, and how he prepared him for it? Egad, as he
says, if he once come to the place of Execution, I know what will
follow.




No Reprieve, I'll secure him, and it will be too late
to tell Tales then.




But prithee, dear Nobs, art thou in earnest; thou hast
curdled my Blood strangely, that was boyling just before with
Joy: bur prithee, that's the way to be torn to pieces by the Rab∣ble,
if I should escape Hanging.



Udslife, Siegniour Intriguo, you are the strangest incredulous
man; Udssish, if the Duke know this, let me be hang'd, 'twould
be of ill consequence; pray let us have no more of that Siegniour.





Sir, The Praefect, according to Warrant, demands the De∣livery
of your Prisoners for Execution.



Siegniour Intriguo, I must obey.




Well Nobs, I hope thou wilt remember thy old Friend.



Fear nothing, I shall, within these two hours, see thee as∣suredly
safe and well.




As Halter and Coffin can make him.




Sir, The Praefect waits.



Lead on, and shew me my mysterious Fate,
To Life or Death, I'm fixt for either state:
My Fears are boundless, but my Hopes a span,
Yet if I Fall, There's no Belief in Man.







Enter King, Corinna, Leonora, undrest, and in Loose Night-Gowns,
Remarquo, slips behind the Hangings.
LEt's barr these Doors, my Dear Corinna, close;
Lest some dark prying Statesman here discover us,
And with his Lamentable Noise of Plots,

Disturb and Interrupt our Secret Pleasures.
Come Leonora, fill my other Arm,
And share the other half of thy Lov'd Monarch.

Here now's my Paradice, my Heaven of Joy,
All that a Monarch can desire or wish for:
Let the Grave Politician shake his Head,
And blame the well-fix'd Choice of my Diversion.
It were a Crime to think that Providence,
Who wisely fix'd us in this lofty Station,
To be the Ease and Profit of our People,
Should at the same time with Severity
Restrain with niggard Hand, the free Enjoyment.


Of all those Pleasures, which our meanest Subjects

Do daily Revel in.


No, no, my Dear:
Let us no longer vainly stand Disputing
What our so well Inspired Souls declare
Is necessary, just and requisite:
Come, to thy Rosie Lips, this Rosie Wine

Shall add another fresh Vermillion Tincture:
See how its Sparkling Spirits Fly to meet thee,
And Dance and Sing to thy approaching Lipps;
Come to thy Health, my Royal Love and Master,
And may'st thou ever like this Generous Wine,
Abound with lofty Spirit, Warmth, and Vigour,
Come Leonora to the King, Fill up.



So, so, the Scene begins well, now for a good Limner,
we shall have delicate Figures for his Fancy to operate on present∣ly:
Well, if the Women hold 〈◊◊〉 they begin, they'll certainly
shame the Men out of the Beastly Sin of Drinking.




Come, To my Royal Lord, Long Health and Ease;
Un-interrupted Joys, and Endless Pleasu•••

The Power, but not the Toyl of Mighty Business▪
Let him Live long. Hungaria's happy King;

Enjoying still an Everlasting Spring.




Dear Leonora, and my Soul Corinna,

It quells my growing Joys, and damps my Pleasures,
To think how small a Span of Power I have,
To Grasp and to Reward, your boundless Merits.
How like a real Monarch should I stand,
If once my struggling Will were dis-intangled
From the Curst Bonds of Haughty Sanhedrims?

How should my Bounty with my Will keep pace,
And Crown my peerless Nymphs extreamest Wishes?
Well, I may Live to see the time.
(Knocking without.


Yes, poor deluded Monarch! thou may'st Live
To see the time, when with a Fatal Sorrow
Thou'lt wish, and wish (when 'tis alas too late!)


'Twere in thy Power to mend, or to re-call
Those Fatal Errors which thy easie Nature
(By these pernicious Arts intic'd) consents to:
When with Insulting Pride thy crafty Foes
Shall Laugh, and Triumph o're thy conquer'd Reason:

When by these very Arts, by which thou think'st,

Poor cheated Prince, to Buoy thy Pleasures up,
Thy Pleasures, Ease, and Life, shall be endangered:
When those who truly pitying now thy Grief,
Would Face Ten Thousand Deaths for thy Relief,
Will coldly then upbraid thy Unbelief.




What sawcy Slave is this, that boldly durst
Intrude upon my Privacy and Pleasures.


Now by the Life of Mahomet, the Man
Designs to affront me with his Impudence.
Prithee, Corinna, know his Name;
K. and Leonora retire to the inner part of the Scenes, out of sight.
While I and Leonora here retire.
Knocking again.
Corinna Goes to the Door.


Who's there? And speak by whose Authority
You thus presume to Alarm my Apartment.



Verily Madam, I am Damasippus, and must Speak to the K.
immediately; I have Important Business to deliver to him.



Prince Damasippus always should be welcom
To great Androgynes and me




I desire always to be welcom to the
King; Pray Madam let me be happy in his sight.



My Lord the King's retir'd, and is asleep,
And gave strict Orders not to be disturb'd.
'Slife, This Prince carries a great Stroak with Androgynes, and if
he should take him away with him, we should miss of our Business:
He must not see him.


Your Highness must needs rest satisfied 'till Morning,
For His Majesty must not be disturb'd.


Alas Madam! It will be a Disturbance to Himself


And the whole Kingdom, if I don't see him:
By your leave Madam.




You'll not use Violence, my Lord.



I hope you don't fear Ravishing, my Lady.




What Noise is that?

What bold Intruder is this?


I humbly conceive, the rarity of such an Action will be a
sufficient Apology to your Majesty, for your Faithful Subject and
Kinsman, Damasippus




Alack, alack, Good Cousin:

What makes you here at this time of Night? What, I'll warrant
you thought you were at the Siege of Rhodes now; well, you are
a Fierce Assailant, but I think you mistook the Cittadel.




Naught less thau Duty, Love, Allegiance, Honour,
Prompted me thus to intrude upon your Secrets:
'Tis Whisper'd, nay, 'tis talk'd in threatning Murmures,
That some, whome my Opinion can't call Friends,
Advise, and have prevail'd by crafty Reasons
To have the Sanhedrim to Morrow broken;
Sir, Let me beg by all the Sacred Tyes
Of Kindred, Friendship, Honour, Gratitude,
Which long have held me Captive to your Will,
And which, 'till now, I never strove t' oppose;
To think what dreadful Consequences may
Flow from so unaccountable Abrupt an Action:
The Nation's Blood is in a boyling Ferment,

Rais'd and Alarm'd by all these late Discoveries:
Their Love and Wishes to your Health and Life,
Which by this Plot seem'd to be chiefly aim'd at,
Did first Foment, and stir their Active Spirits,
To stand prepar'd and ready to defend you:
The Sanhedrim, their Representatives,
Out of a Filial Duty to your Person,
And in pursuance of the People's Wishes,
Desire to search the Danger of that Wound,


Which like a Gangreen would o're spread the Nation;
Already they have Prob'd, and found the Venom
Has reach'd and tainted even the very Vitals,

And by a secret Passage to ascend,
And Dart its Poyson upwards to the Head:

And now like an unruly Patient you
(Forgive me if I once too plainly speak)
(Kneeling.
When even the Root and Cause of your Distemper,
Are by your wise Physicians Skill explor'd;
Refuse t' Accept, or cast away in Anger
Their necessary wholsome Applications:
But then, Dread Sir! consider how the Body,
(For every Member covets its own Safety)
When thus it finds the Head supinely careless,
Or which is worse (which hardly can be thought)
Resolv'd, and bent upon its own Destruction;
Consider then how Nature, common Safety,
(Which sure right Reason should dictate to all)
Will urge them to make speedy Applications,
First by Entreaty, and when that do's fail,

By Power to seek their common Preservation.
This, Sir, I speak, as what I fear will be;

Though Heaven, the Searcher of all Hearts can witness,
My Prayers and hearty Wishes are, It may not.



Well, good Cousin, thou art a rare maker of Speeches, wil't
make One for me to Morrow.



My Blood to serve you should as freely go, as now my
Words.



Nay, nay, But prithee Cousin, thou art turn'd a meer Sto∣ick
all of a suddain: Come you have been dozing like an Old Pae∣dagogue,
over some Obsolete Author, to find out some Abstruse
Question to puzzle his Schollars; Come Damasippus, here's that will
bring theeto thy Self again: Come to Love and Beauty, and Hang
Business.




So, so, That will set him a Float presently, he'll be nothing
  42
but Tropes and Figures in a Moment; you'll see him make a meer
Fool of this Old Politician.




Come Cousin, take your Glass; with the Health;



To every Thing in Season.



Ay right; Come Corinna, give me the Glass;
This Cousin of mine will improve upon our Hands,
He begins to speak to the purpose.




Pray Heavens His Majesty may doe something to right pur∣pose.



Well, I find I shall do no more good upon him to Night;
He's taking Opium on purpose to forget himself, and the Kingdom:
I will wake him again however in the Morning. I humbly Beg your
Majesty to consider of my Petition.




We'll now be free from these State Basilisks,

That with their poysonous Looks destroy our Pleasures.
Come, now Androgynes, let's sit and Revel,
And Toy the tedious Minutes out in Sports and Kisses:
Now thou'rt in wanton Cupid's Fragrant Pallace,
Where nought but Ease and Gay Delights Inhabit:
No Interrupting Thoughts of Business here,
Must now intrude; all Care from hence is Banish'd:
As on the Surface of a clear calm Sea,
We'll Lye, and Bask, and Love our Lives away.




No, rather let us Love and Live for ever.



That came from her Heart o'my Conscience; her way of
Living would give a Body but very little Encouragent to Dye.




Come then Corinna, let us now retire,
And practice o're thy well instructed Lesson:
Come, let me Launch into thy Sea of Love,

And gaze and wonder at thy mighty Treasure:
Oh! now my Soul's a Thirst, and I must Drink:
Come my Blest Angel, let us now retire;
Love, like a greedy Cormorant, cann't wait

The long Formality of Grace before it.
Come, come my Dear.



What means my Liege?
These Actions seem to bear a Mystery.



What a Devil have we to do now? Mean, quoth a, What
should he mean, but to go and repeat your old Lesson of W ing?
I'll be Hang'd but this seeming backwardness carrys some Plaguy de∣sign,
or other with it.



What should'st thou think Androgynes can mean?
Do not these eager Grasps, my trembling Knees;
These dying Languets, thick Imprinted Kisses,
Too well declare the Longings of my Soul.
And can Corinna then ask what I mean?
Come, come, retire Corinna, Love himself


No Niggard is: And why should'st thou, his Steward,
Refuse, or Tardy be to share his Bounty?



But if as Steward, I profusely wast
The present Stock I am intrusted with;
Or indiscreetly lend at each Request,
Before the former Debts and Obligations
Shall be defray'd, and void; I well may fear
A little time, alas! will make me Bankrupt.



So, so, I see the Mine is ready to Spring; I thought there
was some new Business in the Wind; now we shall hear the Con∣science
of her Request; I'll warrant little less than half the next
Subsidy: Oh! these Misses are chargeable Petts, a Body may keep
a stud of Mares, and three Packs of Hounds, cheaper than one
Wh 




Thou speak'st to me in dark mysterious Riddles:
Oh! do not thus Foment my Raging Fire:
Say, dear Corinna, what thou dost require;
Speak quickly; Oh! my Soul, I cann't deny;
Though thy request extend to half my Kingdom.

(He Kisses and huggs her.


Nay, It must be the remaining Half then; for she has had
the value of one half from him already: Now a Body would think
that a Prince that had seen himself so long kept out of his Kingdoms,
should not be so free of disposing of them at every turn, to a paul∣try,
painted Strumpet.



My Royal Lord, Your Bounty always did
With so much ease extend it self to me,
That 'twas with some Reluctancy, that now
I ventur'd to exact some small Addition:
But since Your Majesty has pleas'd so freely
To promise the fulfilling my Request;
Once more I beg, that from your Royal Mouth
You will confirm your Royal Grant.



Speak on; and by our Holy Prophet I do swear,
To th' half my Kingdom it shall be fulfill'd.



Udslife, I am in a plaguy taking; Heaven knows what will
be the Event of this: this looks like a laid Business.




Long Life and Health to Great Androgynes,

Eternal Ease, and never-failing Pleasure.

Here on our bended Knees we humbly Beg,
(Cor. Leon. Knels.
To Morrow may the utmost Period set
To the Meeting of this Haughty Sanhedrim.
This is our Boon, and from our Royal Lord,
We humbly Beg performace of his Word.



Oh Racks, Plagues, Fire, Hell and Tortures! If he grants
this, the Kingdom's ruin'd. Oh Androgynes! Androgynes! Consi∣der
what they ask, and what thou art to give! Consider that thy
own, as well as the Kingdom's safety, are at Stake; and none but
thy Enemy's can require it: This is the Duke all over; there's
his very Picture in the whole Transaction; no wonder they did not
ask for more Money; no doubt, they'll have their Wages from
him, and be well paid, if they obtain.



Dissolve the Sanhedrim! I know not what to think on't.
'Tis true, I wish that they were fairly gon,
(The K. Muses.
But want a clear pretence to send 'em packing:
There are some Tricks indeed in this same Plot,

Which fouly seem to point at Treachery:

But yet my own part in it is so great,
As won't admit of any narrow searching;
I cannot willingly suspect a Brother
Of ill Designs against my Crown and Life;


Since by th' Accomplishment he could but make
A small Addition to his present Glory:
And yet the Evidence seems positive,
Evincing both Consent and Instigation.



But then alas! Androgynes

Thy Life must be embroyl'd in Care and Business;
In such an endless Maze of Toyl and Sorrow
Thoul't be entangled; as will quite destroy
Thy fixed Rules of Love, and Ease, and Pleasure,
And all thy hopes of future Rest and Quiet.
O ye Almighty Powers! Why would you Flatter

Poor Monarchs with the hopes of Power and Glory?
Why do we vainly Boast of Will and Pleasure,
And grasp at absolute Authority?
When each pretending Slave shall dare to stand,
And by a specious Plea of Property;

Of Law, Religion, and such other Trifles,

Shall 'thwart and cross as oft as we Command:
Nay, many times refuse our final Orders:
Why should the Ambitious Toil, and thus contend,
For the poor Glory's of an Anxious Crown?
In which the chiefest Gemms are Cares and Sorrows;

Why should we strive, and covet to Ascend,
As on a lofty Pinacle to Stand,
Sole Spectatours of the glorious World?
While the more happy Mortals do below

Enjoy and Revel in it's various Pleasures.




So, so, if he takes but care to look before
He Leaps, he may perhaps have the Grace to avoid the danger: The
Ladies begin to Scratch; They never like a considering Man.





Udslife Leonora, we must not give him leave to think, we
Must ply him fast; if we fail of this, we are undone!
From this hard contest in your Royal Brest.


My fears Suggest Corinna is deny'd.



Pleasures, Androgynes, of Love and Wine,
Which thy harsh envious interrupting Fate,
Denys, or Robs thee of, but 




Perhaps great Sir our presence may offend;
We will remove the cause.




Heaven's send she proves as good as her Word.
'Twill be the first good thing they ever did in their Lives.



Stay Corinna, stay Leonora, come you must pardon this
abrupt way of dealing with you, an ugly Crabed thought or two
came into my head, and put me on musing, but it is over; but I
have resolv'd.



To send them out of his sight for ever, I hope.




To grant I hope your Hand-maids poor request.



To send and to dissolve the Sanhedrim.



Long Live and Reign the great Androgynes.



Who waits there, Dione.


Run dear Dione with a Lovers Speed,
Corinna runs immediately to the Door.
And tell your Master great Caligula,

The Sanhedrim's no more.




Good Heavens! what will this come to? this must breed
bad Blood in the Kingdom, we shall be altogether by the Ears in a
Moment▪ Our goodly Duke longs for nothing more, and when mat∣ters
are in Confusion, he thinks to pass Unobserv'd. Well, come
when it will, every Man must take his Fortune.
Each Man may stand upon his own Defence,
But few will now be safe in Innocence.



'Tis time Corinna, now, that we with-draw,
And pay our mighty debts of mutual Love:
Henceforth all Care and Business from my Breast;
All sence of fear and danger too I'll Banish:
Wrapt up in Pleasures, I'll supinely wait,
The certain Stroake of my appointed Fate.





The Palace at St. Jacques.





YOu know honest Country Men it stands us upon: If
the Duke fail, all our hopes are quash'd for ever.



Ay, by my Shoul dear Collonel, but the Divel taake me
if he do fail.



No be Chreest and shaint Patrick, but I would Swear
the Moon and the Sheven Stars down first.



You know how the business is, and what to swear.



Hubboo! Hubboo! What to Swear? Ay by my Fait do
I Dear Joy; I vill Swear, I vill Swear; Ay by my Shoul it be no
matter what I do Swear, as long as the Shudge will be wid me, and
taake my part.



This is a pack of rare Villains of the right Stamp and
Breed; a Generation that suck in Villany with their Milk, whose
Native Language is a compound of Oaths, and Lying their only In∣heritance; who have Courage enough only to render 'em Ruffians,
and who have no other Sence or Honour than Impudence. Now
there are good Caligula's Creatures and Favorites, the Darlings of
His heart, and his only true Friends, that are prepar'd to comfort
and discountenance the Plot, and to Hector People out of their
Belief, or their Lives: But let's hear their Lesson.




You must take your Corporal Oaths, That this Pertinax was
with you in Company in Hungary, the very time that he declar'd he
was over Sea.



Ay, the Devil taake me, but he was, I vill taake my Oath,
by any Corporal in Teagueland, if my Collonel says so.



An obedient Rogue to his Officer this: and yet such is the
Iniquity of the preseut times, that the Duke do's not doubt to get a
Judge to perswade, and a Jury to believe such an Evidence.



I have several other points to instruct you in; but you must
taake time to practice this first.



By my Shalvashon dear Joy, I must have some great ting
to swear against dis Pertinax: ara But who be dis Rogue dear Joy?



Oh Hone! Oh Hone! a Rogue that do maake a great
Swear against our Holy Shurch.



In the mean time here is some Money for you, and if you do
your business well, the Duke will make you all Officers, you shall
all have Commissions.



By Chreesht dear Joy, Saint Patricks Blessing be upon thy
sweet Faash.




Things run so smoothly, and with such Success,
Each project of our busie Brain is Crown'd;
That it dos half perswade me to believe,
That Providence has now espous'd our Cause:
What mayn't be hop'd from my most glorious Master,
Who with such ease, and in so short a time,
Has Master'd such Strong-headed difficultys?
Has reconcil'd so many Contradictions;
That now tis next to Blasphemy to question
The power of doing, if he but undertake it!
With what dexterity did he Ingage
The Lady's to address, and to procure
The dissolution of the Sanhedrim?
A thing the Court thought no way Feasible;
And though some busie Factious heads are left,
Who yet pretend to rake the cover'd Embers;
Yet he is neither Ignorant, or unmindfull,
And waits a fit Occasion to requite them:
He has laid his Snare, and has his game in View,
And something more than humane skill must save them:
Bold Aristander, Poliarchus, Timon,

Will quickly Mourn their hasty Christian Zeal;
And th' anger of a just enraged Prince:
Their busie Scruting, and bold Abhorrence

Of what they call our Plot, Conspiracy, &c.


Shall be return'd with such Dexterity,

In their own Words, upon their very selves,

As shall compleat, and by their own Assistance,
All that our Wishes can suggest unto us.
Thus when the several Branches are cut down,
Under whose Shade the unthinking Crowd does Shelter;
Then to the Root we will our Axes lay,
Religion, Liberty, and Lives shall down,
Unless they'll Truckle to the Triple Crown.





The Long Gallery at Alba Regalis.
Enter Remarquo stamping, and tearing his Hair.


OH Treason! Treason! Villains, Rogues; Whether shall
an Honest Man fly to secure himself? Hell never could
match these cursed Pagans, these bloody Jebusites, and more bloody
Caligula!






Why how now Remarquo; Thou art
not afraid of me sure?

(Remarquo sees him, and flyes on one side to avoid him.


Yes marry, and good reason.
Stand off, Sir: I shall be brought in for the new
Plot here, presently. Come Sir, come,
I'll have no Papers convey'd into my Pocket;

No, not so much as the Old Observator. Look, look, the Villain
has 'em ready in his Hand: If the Rascal should Forswear himself
now, and say he had them from me.



Pish, prithee Man, never Fear; Thou dost not look like a
Plotter: Come, come, I'll Protect Thee; and egad, if thou art not
satisfied, I'll Publish it in my Weekly Paper; and then see who'll be
so bold as to contradict it: But the Truth on't is, there is a hor∣rible
Plot found out, carry'd on by the Whiggs, to destroy far
  50
and near all that ever they could lay their hands to: Oh! they are
terrible Fellows I'll warrant ye; the Pagan Plot was one of theirs,
it was as like 'em as ever they could stare.



Good lack, Sir, I thought you had taken a great deal of
pains to prove there was none: Your Memory fails you; or may be
that which was but an Embrio then, is by this time grown to per∣fection.



Why this it is now to have a Man's Sense thrown away, up∣on
Ignorance and Heedlesness. I prov'd, Sir, 'Gad, and no body can
gainsay it, That there was no Pagan Plotter; and now, Sir, I'll
prove, that this and that are all one.



O' my Conscience the Monkey has unluckily hit on the right
of it; the same Heads made both.
(Aside.
But pray, Sir, what sort of Persons are they that have engaged
in this new Plot, as you call it?



Why, between you and I, Sir, every one that had the impudence
to prosecute the old One: And 'Gad, Sir, let me tell ye, it is but rea∣sonable;
for the King and Duke have declar'd it shall be so.



And indeed I believe that's all the evidence they have to
prove it. But pray, Sir, what Persons are taken up about it?




Oh! a great many, you may be sure; but the chief are Count
Aristander, who is clapt in the Great Tower, together with the Lord
Poliarchus, and Timon, 'Gad, whom I am very sorry for; he is a
Brother of the Quill, and, 'Gad, some sharp things were found
by him, fo that he was committed among the rest.



Against whom did he write, pray Sir? Did he name any one?



No, no; but the truth on't is, he wrote very scurrilously, that
I must needs say, and upon a false Topick.



Yes, I heard he had the confidence to write, that Kings
were made of the same Flesh and Blood as other People; that they
were subject to the same Infirmities as other Men; that Lusts, Pas∣sions,
and Vices, were sometimes predominant in them, as in others;
and consequently when any of them were so given over to all sorts
of Licentiousness and bloody Tyranny, as to neglect the great End
for which they were set over their People; and instead of protecting
them in their Laws, Liberties, Religion, and Lives, they would
  51
endeavour wholly to subvert and destroy them; that then it was
lawful for such a People to take such proper means as might restrain;
and if that would not do, to resist, and obtain that by force, which
he would not in Justice grant: And all this as his private general
Opinion of the Case, without the least Reflection on the King or
his Government.



Ay but, Sir, if the King thought it was, 'tis sufficient for his Im∣prisonment
and Condemnation.



Nay, he was not so wise as the Fox in the Fable, who mee∣ting
a Beast with a bunch in his Forehead, going to the Lion's Court,
told him the King's Proclamation to forbid the access of all horned
Beasts. But the Beast pleading his Bunch was no wise a Horn, the
Fox warily caution'd him with your Question, What if the King
should call it so? But all this while, Mr. Nobbs, this is Arbitrary
and Tyrannical.



Udslife, how came this Hobby-horse with such a weighty Ob∣jection?
'Gad I must pump hard to confute it in my next Observator;
and 'Gad I'll do it, I'll warrant me.




This is dangerous Discourse, let me tell you; but it shall
go no farther, because you are my Friend: But 'Gad I could give
you such an Answer to't, as should make you stare.



I am willing to be instructed.



Ay but, Sir, I shall take my own opportunity, and so fare∣wel.




He still keeps to his old way of Answering, like a Dog
when he lights of a very hard Bone, he smells to it, and lets it lie.
Ah, poor Hungaria! How endless are thy Sorrows!
To what yet cruel Fate art thou reserved?
By what unheard-of strange Abominations
Hast thou provok'd these heavy Plagues and Judgments?
Thou hast seen the Bulwark of thy Lawsthrown down,
Thy Rights and lawful Liberties invaded:
Thou hast seen thy faithful, pious, generous Sons
Expos'd to the rage of barbarous Assassins;
Others by cruel wily Arts betray'd,
And Victims made to a mock-seeming Justice.


Thou hast seen thy King and Father careless stand
(Like Nero harping o'er the Fire of Rome)
Smiling and revelling in wanton Lusts,
Whilst his insatiate cruel-minded Brother,
Like the same Nero, blandisheth his Sword,
Wishing, with him, that at one fatal blow
He might compleat his faithful Peoples ruine.
Wake, drowsie Monarch from thy Lethargy,
And shun the threatning Dangers that surround thee.
In vain we cry, in vain we do complain.
Unwilling and unable he to hear us.
Drench't in a Sea of Lust and Sloth he lies,
Unable to recover till he dies.





Enter three Citizens and Remarquo.



AY, Neighbour, that's true; but however I care not
how many Plots there are, so there be no Taxes.



True; what care I if the Sanhedrim don't sit these seven
years. A murrain on 'em, they never come together but it costs
me as much Money as would maintain my Family a Month: Beside,
'twonld be ill manners to pretend to love 'em, when the King so
solemnly hates 'em.



Why, to be plain, Neighbour, I could be content to live
without Taxes as well as any of you; but I fear we shall pay for it
one day; as they say, the King is not made of Money, nor is he so
very thrifty of that little he has, but that he must want in a little time;
and then 'tis more than probable we must play over the second part
of the Tune call'd Royal Aid, or Ship-Money, or something worse.
Come, come, Neighbour, the Sanhedrim have been very bountiful
already, and there has been but very odd Accounts of the laying it
  53
out; and now they are willing to keep their Hands in their Pocket,
till they know what use their Money's to be put to.



A good honest sort of a plain Fellow this, and not altoge∣ther
insensible.




But, Neighbour, were Sanhedrims ordain'd for nothing but
to find out ways to give the King Money?



Not for these twenty years last past, I think they have been
of little use else.



He is in the right on't; for the King and his Brother being
very wise good Men themselves, did not need their Advice in any thing
else.



But what news have we got to day, Neighbour? What
says that bawling Nobs, in his plauguy Observator?





Why, he says there is a most horrible New Plot; and
that there's above half the Kingdom concern'd in it.



Ay, and the better half every way; for there's hardly an
honest Man in the Kingdom but will be brought into it.




Look, look! is not that Mr. Trueman of our Country,
Neighbour? 'Tis he, I believe, just come to Town too; I'll speak
to him. Sir, I am glad too see you; How long have you been come?



I am just alighted, thank ye, good Country-man. Well, how
fares it with you? What good News stirring?



Why, truly nothing at present, but the old News of the
New Plot.



Is that all? I am glad of it indeed. I was in Company
yesterday-morning near forty Miles off, where it was confident∣ly
asserted, That Count Aristander had kill'd himself in the Tower.



Ha, ha! kill'd himself, quoth he, I wish I had a good Lease
of his Life till that time.



How! kill'd himself! Pray, Sir, we had not a word of it
here.



Why only cut his own Throat, or so; Sir, that's all.





Neighbour Gripewel! Neighbour, come hither, I'll tell
you some News. Ha, ha, cut his Throat, quoth he!







Why, this Geatleman heard in the Country yesterday,
that Count Aristander, that wise, temperate, pious Nobleman,
had kill'd himself; cut his own Throat, Mun; ha, ha, ha.



Yesterday? you mistake, Sir, it was to day.



No, no, Sir, it was yesterday, and forty Miles off this place,
so it was.



Why, I tell you it was impossible; it was this very day, and
within these two hours.



What, Sir, you heard it within these two hours?



No, Sir, it was actually done within these two hours; Ari∣stander
cut his own Throat, Sir, within these two hours in the
Tower, Sir; I came but just from thence.



Heavens bless us! Is it true then?



He did it with a Razor, and with a good will too, for he
has almost cut his Head off; and after he had done it, he steps to the
Window, and throws out the Razor, that he might not be found
Felo de se.



Oh! my misgiving Soul, how true a Prophet hast thou
proved!



I can tell you father, that the good Lord Poliarchus is up∣on
his Trial found Guilty of High Treason.



Oh, good Heavens! Murther! Murther! plain design'd
Murther! Oh, unmatch'd Villany! Oh, unspeakable cruelty!

Whether shall Innocence or Vertue fly?
Where can they hope to find a safe Protection?
Where can the Needy and the Poor retire
From the vow'd rage of prosecuting Foes,
If thus the Great, the Noble, Pious, Good,
Fall, equally obnoxious to their Malice?
What Place? what Guard can be secure or safe,
If thus the Palace, Castle of the King,
Where sure inviolate as in his presence
All should remain, till thence by Law delivered)
Is made the Den, the Trap, the Snare for Murther?
Oh! ye Eternal, Just, Revenging, Powers!


If the loud Sins of this unhappy Nation,
Have thus brought down your Plagues and Judgments on us,
In Mercy now desist from farther ruine.
See how the heaps of slaughter'd Bodies lie,
The Monuments of your Almighty Justice!
Oh! now forgive and stay the slaughrering Angel,
That that thus with undistinguish'd rage pursues us.
Our fainting Spirits now at last restore;
In pity let Hungaria bleed no more.





The Vestry belonging to the Jebusites Chappel at St. Jacques.
The Scene opens, and discovers Caligula; his Confession. Two Jebu∣sites and Le Talbo at Counsel; about the place hang Pistols, Dag∣gers,
Guns, Bow-strings, Halters, and all other Instruments of
Death.


WEll, Holy Father, what do's yet remain,
Which I with glad concurrence will not grant,
To render meour Mothers worthy Son?

Tell me, my wise Instructors; have not I
Shewn and drawn out in lively Characters,
A just assurance of your future Joys?
I think if Loyala himself were here,
And with impartial Judgment consider,
How strict I have been a Follower of his steps:
How to the life I've copied his Original:

How well digested and improv'd his Precepts,
I think, grave Fathers, he nor you could blush
To own and praise the merit of my Deeds.



Great Sir, believe it quite impossible
To find that Villain, that could dare deny
Th' Mighty Wonders of your glorious Life.
Truth, like the bright Meridian Sun, shines out,



And to the gazing wondring World, discovers
More Valour, Wisdom, in your single self,
Than half Mankind together else can claim:
In mighty Acts of War invincible,
In Peace superlatively Wise and Prudent.
But above all, great Sir, your holy Zeal,
(Like the bright Moon amidst the twinkling Stars)
Has, with such vast effectual Influence,
Scatter'd its golden Rays among your People,
That after-Ages will be at a stand
Where they shall fix your highest Attribute;

And doubt which most they should extol and praise,
Your Courage, Wisdom, or your Piety.



'Tis true, I suck'd in with my Infant-Milk,
Which only with my Blood can be allay'd;
A flaming Zeal to holy Mother-Church.

And though all Art and Industry be try'd,
Whereby to right and raise our sinking Cause;
Yet while my Brother, whose soft timerous Nature
Delays and clips the Wings of all our Hopes,
While he dams up and clogs the easie passage,
To the wide Field of Power and Liberty,

I fear we toil in vain.




Great Sir, declare it lawful and deserving,

To lay aside all Obstacles that seem

A Damage or Dishonour to our Church;
And we can hardly doubt Androgynes,

If he be truly Pagan, as he owns,
Will grudge or scruple once to step aside,

Till by the means of his more active Brother,
Our dropping Cause revive.



'Tis not our Care
To search his Will, which great Caligula,

Convinc'd by our Advice and solid Reasons,
Declares his Pleasure in this weighty Case:
Our Duty bids us bow, and straight obey him.



Our Holy Prophet knows, most Reverend Fathers,'tis not Ambition
prompts my eager Soul, thus to ascend the Throne my Brother fills; Nor
can it Interest be, since all the Kingdom, my Treasures mount almost to In∣finite;
nor can the other Darling of ones Soul, Revenge, allure me to com∣mit
this Deed.



Why, when he speaks thus, he certainly pretends to banter us.Ud∣slife,
sure he would not mock us: Not Ambition, quoth he! No, not Ambition
by any means; though he could dispence with, and intreigue and endeavour
to supplant his Brother, before he enjoy'd his Crown: But that's all one; he
does but blandish our own Weapons; and we'll give him leave to talk, so we
get but our Ends of him. And then again, 'Tis not Interest: Ha, ha, ha; I'll
vow he makes me laugh: No, not Interest? though by Traffick and Merchan∣dising,
by the best Places of Profit, and by cheating his Brother, he has scrap'd
up half the Money of the Kingdom, for this very Use and Design: And then
for Revenge, since I am never like to be his Enemy, and consequently not liable
to it, I'll not trouble my self much with it; though by the bye, I could instance
in a Cloud of Witnesses, to bear Testimony of his calm forgiving Nature.



'Tis only, Reverend Sirs, a Pious Zeal
To propagate, or re-induce, with speed,
Those Holy Principles, that Glowing Faith,
Which warm'd the the Souls of our Wise Primitive Fathers.



Designs so Pious, ought to be encouraged,
And prompted with the Hopes of vast Rewards:
Masses, Indulgences, and Dispensations
Shall Crown your Work, even to Infinity;
Our Prayers shall all, Unanimous, be sent
To our most Holy Prophet, and his Mother,

For Success here, and joy t'your Soul hereafter.
But say, Great Sir, When will your Generous Soul,
Spare a few Minutes for so Great a Work.



To Morrow Night he does design to Revel,
And Sup with Count d' Arlin, and my self:
I have agreed le Talbo shall be there.
And help to Administer, and serve at Table:
And when his Heart is warm with Love and Wine;

His Fancy tickled with Delight and Pleasure;
When with his Praises we have fill'd his Thoughts,
And lull'd his Reason quite beyond suspition;

Then, Holy Fathers, then, the Minute blest,
Which by his Loss restores our Joys forever.

This is the manner, that the appointed time;
Fly Lazy Minutes, prompt on the Lazy Sun;
Sick with delay, I faint 'till it be done.









WHO waits there? Enter Waiter: Where is Erone?



May it please your Majesty, she waits the Dutchess's com∣ing
in the Antichamber: You both can sing Damon's Farewel. Call her, and
let me hear it.



E•••a and the Waiter appear
within the Scenes; they Sing
to 〈◊〉 Musick of Flutes Lutes,
and Base-Viols.


Methinks a strange unusual Melancholly,
Has of a sudden siezed my Flagging Spirits:
Avert all ill, you Powers!



The King points to them
to stand still while the
Song is singing.





Stay, stay, dear heart;
Stay but one poor hour or two:
Sure there's more than that, to Love and Friendship due.

Da. Though theres Musick in thy Tongue,
And every Word's a well-tun'd Song:

Though thy Tears can more perswade,
Than Prayers by dying Martyrs made;
Yet they cannot Fate re-call;
Tears, with Death, cannot prevail.



Shall rude Death then me bereave
Of my Love's Prerogative?
Stay, dear heart, Love bids thee stay.



But Fate, hard fate, commands away.



How shall I, alas! Survive,
When for thee alone I live;
When thy Life and Beauty's dead,
Love and Grief, Love and Grief,
Shall quickly strike me Dead.



Come then, let's leave this World together.
And mount those blest Abodes;
Where we'll be Lords o're Death and Fate,
And equal to the Gods.




'Tis a good Melancholly Humour; Is it not Brother?



Sir, I am no admirer of dull, heavy, Love Songs; I am for the noise
of Drums and Trumpets, and Shrieks of Conquer'll Enemys: I hope to see him
make me a little such Musick by and by: This Song might serve for an Epi∣taph;
I wonder how the Devil he came to hit on this unluckly Humour! I
hope he has no dying thoughts of a sudden, that may spoil our design

It grows pretty late; I wish your Majesty would honour us with your Com∣pany
at Supper.



Ay, come lead on.
Come all sit down; we must be equal here:


open, and discover a Table
spread, &c. They sit down.


Le Talbo, thou must wait; the rest retire:
Some Wine Le Talbo.

(They fall on Eating.
Sir I be bold to Whisper; Long last Corinna's Charms.



Come with all my heart; I love the little Jade strangely: She has
some little Pouting looks, that take me very much.



I have that will take him more: Come fill to D'Arlin.



Your Highness is in a very pleasant humour; I Cogratulate it: Has
your Highness any extraordinary Occasion for it?




the King]The bravest Bona, Roba, Fresh and Plump, Fine and Gay. Your Ma∣jesty
will give me leave to part in time, for the Minute draws near.







Prithee, Caligula; thou hast put me a
gadding too. Le Talbo, get me Chocolate before I part.




upon me! Why he thrusts himself upon it, without my Advice or Assistance.
Well, I may say my Conscience is clear. (Aside.) Come, D' Arlin, thou hast
a sweet Tooth left, a ticklish Vain doubtless


to the King and D'Arlin.


'Tis well made; and a good taste.

D'Ar. turns his Faoe about and makes wry Faces as if he was sick.
(They drink.


Well, I'll straight be ready to go.




I'll warrant thee ready to Dye presently.




What strange dizzyness is this that o're whelms my Brain! My
Spirits sink and throb about my Heart: Heaven keep us from Treachery:
I'll give the King a hint, Heavens preserve him, and I care not.




It works too soon, I fear





Never fear; if he fall now, there's his Old
Distemper will bear the worst can be said;
(The King seems to
sit uneasie.
he has been us'd to an Apoplexy, and this will symbolize with it.
(Aside.



I must take my leave of your Majesty, while I send this
Note.



No, stay 'till we all go.

(King pulls to make d'Arlin stay;
and in the mean time, he slips
the Letter into the King's hand,
unseen.


Read this, Great Sir! I have just
Life enough to wish you safe 
(Aside.) Ex. d'Ar.The King turns to the Window with the Letter, and while he Reads, he Faints
back, and falls without speaking.



(running) Heavens save ihe King!



Save him! What dost mean? His Life? If thou wer't another Bro∣ther,
thou should'st pay for that Word, if he should recover; I'll not have
so much as one good Wish, during my Reign, which I reckon is well be∣gun.
Here, make a noise, and Alarm the Court! We must have the For∣mality
of Mourning. Well, Is not this an easie way of obtaining a King∣dom?
He, whose aspiring Heart to Empire bears,
Should banish first all empty Doubts and Fears;
Never consider, so he can obtain,
The Care, the Crime, the Danger, but the Gain.
The End of the Fifth Act.
