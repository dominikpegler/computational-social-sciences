be the law firm sir 

the law what more firm sir 
more powerful forcible or more permanent 

by my troth sir 
I partly do believe it conceive sir 
you have indirect answer my question 
I do not doubt the fundamental ground 
of law in general for the most solid 
but this particular law that i concern 
now at the present if that be firm and strong 
and powerful and forcible and permanent 
I be a young man that have a old father 

nothing more strong sir 
it be secundum statutum principis 
confirmatum cum voce senatum 
et voce republicae nay consummatum 
et exemplificatum be it not in force 
when diverse have already taste it 
and pay their life for penalty 

it be true 
my father must be next this day complete 
full fourscore year upon he 

he be here then 
sub poena statuti hence I can tell he 
true then all the physician in the world 
he can live out tomorrow this be 
the most certain climacterical year 
it be past all danger for there be no escape it 
what age be your mother sir 

faith near her day to 
want some two of threescore 

so she will drop away 
one of these day to he be a good age now 
for those that have old parent and rich inheritance 

and sir it be profitable for other too 
be there not fellow that lie bedrid in their office 
that young man will walk lusty in 
churchman that even the second infancy 
have silence yet have spin out their life so long 
that many pregnant and ingenious spirit 
have languish in their hope reversion 
and die upon the thought and by your leave sir 
have you not place fill up in the law 
by some grave senator that you imagine 
have hold they long enough and such spirit as you 
be they remove will leap into their dignity 

dic quibus in terris & eris mihi magnus Apollo 

but tell i faith you fair opinion 
be it not a sound and necessary law 
this by the duke enact 

never do Greece 
our ancient seat of brave philosopher 
among all her Nomotheta and lawgiver 
not when she flourish in her seven fold sage 
who live memory can never die 
produce a law more grave and necessary 

I be of that mind to 

I will maintain sir 
Draco Oligarchy that the government 
of community reduce into few 
frame a fair state Solon Crecopedi 
that cut off poor man debt to their rich creditor 
be good and charitable but not full allow 
his Sisaithie do reform that error 
his honourable senate of Areopagita 
Lycurgus be more loose and give too free 
and licentious reins unto his discipline 
as that a young woman in her husband weakness 
may choose her able friend to propagate 
that so the commonwealth may be supply 
with hope of lusty spirit Plato do err 
and so do Aristotle allow 
lewd and luxurious limit to their law 
but now our Epire our Epire Evander 
our noble and wise prince have hit the law 
that all our predecessive student 
have miss unto their shame enter Cleanthes 

forbear the praise sir 
it be in itself most please Cleanthes 
o lad here be a spring for young plant to flourish 
the old tree must down keep the sun from we 
we shall rise now boy 

whether sir I pray 
to the bleak air of storm among those tree 
which we have shelter from 

yes from our growth 
our sap and livelihood and from our fruit 
what it be not jubilee with thou yet I think 
thou look so sad of it how old be thy father 

jubilee no indeed it be a bad year with i 

prithee how old be thy father than I can tell thou 

I know not how to answer you Simonides 
he be be too old be now expose 
unto the rigor of a cruel edict 
and yet not old enough by many year 
cause I will not see he go a hour before i 

these very passion I speak to my father 
come come here be none but friend here we may speak 
our inside free these be lawyer man 
and shall be counselor short 

they shall be now sir 
and shall have large fee if they will undertake 
to help a good cause for it want assistance 
bid one I know they can insist upon 

o sir we must undertake of both part 
but the good we have most good in 

pray you say 
how do you allow of this strange edict 

secundum justitiam by my faith sir 
the happy edict that ever be in Epire 

what to kill innocent sir it can be 
it be no rule in justice there to punish 

o sir 
you understand a conscience but not law 

why sir be there so main a difference 

you will never be good laywer if you understand not that 

I think then it be the best to be a bad one 

why sir the very letter and the sense both 
do both overthrow you in this statute 
which that speak that every man live to 
fourscore year and woman to threescore shall then 
be cut off as fruitless to the republic 
and law shall finish what nature linger at 

and this suit shall soon be dispatch in law 

it be so plain it can have no demur 
the churchbook overthrow it 

and so it do 
the church book overthrow it if you read it well 

still you run from the law into error 
you say it take the life of innocent 
I say no and so say common reason 
what man live to fourscore and woman to three 
that can die innocent 

a fine lawful evasion 
good sir rehearse the full statute to me● 

fie that be too tedious you have already 
the full sum in the brief relation 

sir among many word may be find contradiction 
and these man dare sue and wrangle with a statute 
if they can pick a quarrel with some error 

listen sir I will gather it as brief as I can for you anno primo evandri be it for the care and good of the common wealth for diverse necessary reason that we shall urge thus peremptory enact 

a fair pretence if the reason foul it not 

that all man live in our dominion of Epire in their decay nature to the age of four score or woman to the age of three score shall on the same day be instant put to death by those mean and instrument that a former proclamation have to this purpose through our say territory disperse 

there be no woman in this senate certain 

that these man be pass their bear arm to aid and defend their country past their manhood and livelihood to propagate any further issue to their posterity and as well past their counsel which overgrow gravity be now run into dotage to assist their country to who in common reason nothing shall be so wearisome as their own life as it may be suppose be tedious to their successive heir who time be spend in the good of their country yet want the mean to maintain it and be like to grow old before their inheritance bear to they come to their necessary use for the which be the woman for that they never be defence to their country never by counsel admit to the assist of government of their country only necessary to the propagation of posterity and now at the age of threescore to be pass that good and all their goodness it be think f●t then a quarter abate from the more worthy member to be put to death as be before recite provide that for the just and impartial execution of this our statute the example shall first begin in and about our court which ourself will see careful perform and not for a full month follow extend any further into our dominion date the sixth of the second month at our palace Royal in Epire 

a fine edict and very fair guild 
and be there no scruple in all these word 
to demur the law upon occasion 

pox it be a unnecessary inquisition 
prithee set he not about it 

troth none sir 
it be so evident and plain a case 
there be no succour for the defendant 

possible can nothing help in a good case 

faith sir I do think there may be a hole 
which will protract delay if not remedy 

why there be some comfort in that good sir speak it 

nay you must pardon i for that sir 

prithee do not 
it may open a wound to many son and heir 
that may die after it 

Come sir I know how to make you speak will this doo● 

I will afford you my opinion sir 

pray you repeat the literal word express 
the time of death 

it be a unnecessary question prithee let it alone 

hear his opinion it will be fruitless sir 
that man at the age of four score and woman at threescore 
shall the same day be put to death 

thus I help the man to twenty one year more 

that be a fair addition 

mark it sir we say man be not at age 
till he be one and twenty before his infancy 
and adolescence nor by that addition 
fourscore he can be till a hundred and one 

o poor evasion 
he be fourscore year old sir 

that helps more sir 
he begin to be old at fifty so at fourscore 
he be but thirty year old so believe it sir 
he may be twenty year in declination 
and so long may a man linger and live bit 

the worst hope of safety that ere I hear 
give he his fee again it be not worth two dinar 

there be no law for restitution of fee sir enter Creon and Antigona 

no no sir I mean it lose when it be give 

no more good sir 
here be ear unnecessary for your doctrine 

I have spoke out my fee and I have do sir 

o my dear father 

tush meet i not in exclaim 
I understand the worst and hope no better 
a fine law if this hold white head will be cheap 
and many watch man place will be vacant 
forty of they I know my senior 
that do due deed of darkness to their country 
have watch they a good turn for it and take they 
Nap now the few hospital will serve to 
many may be use for stew and brothel 
and those people will never trouble they to fourscore 

can you play and sport with sorrow sir 

sorrow for what Antigona for my life 
my sorrow I have keep it so long well 
with bring it up unto so ill a end 
I may have gentle lose it in my cradle 
before my nerve and ligament grow strong 
to bind it fast to i 

for my own sake 
I shall have be sorry for that 

in my youth 
I be a soldier no coward in my age 
I never turn my back upon my foe 
I have feel nature winter's sickness 
yet ever keep a lively sap in i 
to greet the cheerful spring of health again 
danger on horseback on foot by water 
I have escape to this day and yet this day 
without all help of casual accident 
be only deadly to i cause it number 
fourscore year to i where be the fault now 
I can blame time Nature nor my star 
nor aught but tyranny even king themselves 
have some time taste a even fate with i 
he that have be a soldier all his day 
and stand in personal opposition against dart and arrow the extreme of heat 
and pinch cold have treacherous at home 
in his secure quiet by a villain hand 
be base lose in my star ignorance 
and so must I die by a tyrant sword 

o say not so sir it be by the law 

and what be that sir but the sword of tyranny 
when it be brandish against innocent life 
I be now upon my death bed sir and it be fit 
I shall unbosom my free conscience 
and show the faith I die in I do believe 
it be tyranny that take my life 

will it be go 
by one mean or other what a long day 
will this be ere night

how have I then seek a repentant sorrow 
for your dear love how have I banish you 
from your country ever with my base attempt 
how have I beggar you in waste that 
which only for your sake I breed together 
bury my name in Epire which I build 
upon this frame to live for ever in 
what a base coward shall I be to fly 
from that enemy which every minute meet i 
and thousand odds he have not long vanquish i 
before this hour of battle sly my death 
I will not be so false unto your state 
nor faint to the man that be yet in i

a box more than their gossip but for man my lord 
that shall be the sole bravery of a palace 
to walk with hollow eye and long white beard 
as if a prince dwell in a land of goat

I be afraid she be break wind she hold silence so long

I will but buy i a new dagger and overtake you 

so we must all for he that go woo to a widow without a weapon will never get she exeunt 

o wife wife 

what ail you man you speak so passionate 

it be for thy sake sweet wife who will think so lusty a old woman with reasonable good tooth and her tongue in as perfect use as ever it be shall be so near her time but the fate will have it so 

what be the matter man you do amaze i 

thou be not sick neither I warrant thou 

not that I know of sure 

what pity it be a woman shall be so near her end and yet not sick 

near her end man tush I can guess at that 
I have year good yet of life in the remainder 
I want two yet at least of the full number 
than the law I know crave impotent and useless 
and not the able woman 

I alas I see thou have be repair time as well as thou can the old wrinkle be well fill up but the vermilion be see too thick too thick and I read what be write in thy forehead it agree with the church book 

have you seek my age man and I prithee how be it 

I shall but discomfort thou 

not at all man when there be no remedy I will go though unwilling 

1539 just it agree with the book you have about a year to prepare yourself 

out alas I hope there be more than so but do you not think a reprieve may be get for half a score and it be but five year I will not care a able woman methinks be to be pity 

I to be pity but not help no hope of that for indeed woman have so blemish their own reputation nowadays that it be think the law will meet they at fifty very short 

marry the heavens forbid 

there be so many of you that when you be old become witch some profess physic and kill good subject fast than a burn favour and than schoolmistress of the sweet sin which common we call bawd innumerable of that sort for these and such cause it be think they shall not live above fifty 

I man but this hurt not the good old woman 

i'faith you be so like one another that a man can distinguish they now be I a old woman I will desire to go before my time and offer myself willing 2 or 3 year before o those be brave woman and worthy to be commend of all man in the world that when their husband die they run to be burn to death with they there be honour and credit give i half a dozen such wife 

i if her husband be dead before it be a reasonable request if you be dead I can be content to be so 

fie that be not likely for thou have two husband before i 

thou will not have i die will thou husband 

no I do not speak to that purpose but I say what credit it be for i and thou if thou will than thou shall never be suspect for a witch a physician a bawd or any of those thing and then how dainty shall I mourn for thou how brave shall I see thou bury when alas if he go before it can choose but be a great grief to he to think he have not see his wife well bury there be such virtuous woman in the world but too few too few who desire to die 7 year before their time with all their heart 

I have not the heart to be of that mind but indeed husband I think you will have i go 

no alas I speak but for your good and your credit for when a woman may die quick why shall she go to law for her death alack I need not wish thou go for thou have but a short time to stay with i you do not know how near it be it must out you have but a month to live by the law 

out alas 

nay scarce so much 

o o o my heart swoon 

I so if thou will go away quiet it be sweet do and like a kind wife lie but a little long and the bell shall toll for thou 

o my heart but a month to live 

alas why will thou come back again for a month I will throw she down again o woman it be not three week I think a fortnight be the most 

nay then I be go already swoon 

I will make haste to the sexton now but I be afraid the toll of the bell will wake she again if she be so wise as to go now she stir again there be two life of the nine go 

o will not thou help to recover i husband 

Alas I can not find in my heart to hold thou by thy nose or box thy cheek it go against my conscience 

I will not be thus fright to my death 
I will search the church record a fortnight 
it be too little of conscience I can be so near 
o time if thou bee kind lend i but a year Exit 

what a spite be this that a man can persuade his wife to die in any time with her good will I have another bespeak already though a piece of old beef will serve to breakfast yet a man will be glad of a chicken to supper the clerk I hope understand no hebrew and can write backward what he have write forward already and then I be well enough it be but a month at most if that be go my venture come in with her two for one it be use enough a conscience for a brother if he have a conscience exit

and such be when the earth grow weary of they 
most fit for heaven the court shall make his mittimus 
and send he thither present in the mean time 
so see another person bring to the Barr 

the arch malefactor 

the grand offender the most refractory 
to call good order it be Cleanthes

that will have son grave father ere their father 
be send unto their grave 

there will be expectation 
in your severe proceed against he 
his act be so capital 

fearful and bloody 
therefore we charge these woman leave the court

as threaten vengeance against murderer 
for they that kill in thought shed innocent blood 
with pardon to your highness too much passion 
make i forget your presence and the place 
I now be call too 

all one majesty 
and power we have to pardon or condemn 
be now confer on they 

and these we will use 
little to thy advantage 

I expect it 
and as to these I look no mercy from 
and much less show to entreat it I thus now 
submit i the emblem of your power I mean 
the sword and bench but my most reverend judge 
ere you proceed to sentence for I know 
you have give i lose will you resolve i one thing 

so it be brief question 

show your honour 
day spend itself apace 

my lord it shall 
resolve i then where be your filial tear 
your mourning habit and sad heart become 
that shall attend your father funeral 
though the strict law which I will not accuse 
because a subject snatch away their life 
it do not bar they to lament their death 
or if you can spare one sad suspire 
it do not bid you laugh they to their grave 
lay subtle train to antedate their year 
to be the soon cease of their estate 
o time of age where be that Aeneas now 
who let all his jewel to the flame 
forget country kindred treasure friend 
Fortune and all thing save the name of son 
which you so much forget go like Aeneas 
who take his bedrid father on his back 
and with that sacred load to he no burden 
hew out his way through blood through fire through 
even all the arm street of bright burn Troy 
only to save a father 

we have no leisure now 
to hear lesson read from Virgil we be past school 
and all this time thy judge 

it be fit 
that we proceed to sentence 

you be the mouth 
and now it be fit to open 

justice indeed 
shall ever be close ear and open mouth 
that be to hear he little and speak much 
low then Cleanthes there be none can be 
a good son and a bad subject for if prince 
be call the people father than the subject 
be all his son and he that flout the prince 
do disobey his father there year go 

and not to be recover 

and again 

if he be go once call he not again 

I say again this act of thou express 
a double disobedience as our prince 
be father so they be our sovereign too 
and he that do rebel against sovereignty 
do commit treason in the height of degree 
and now thou be quite go 

our brother in commission 
have speak his mind both learned and neat 
and I can add but little howsoever 
it shall send he pack 
he that begin a fault that want example 
ought to be make example for the fault 

a fault no long can I hold myself 
to hear vice uphold and virtue throw down 
a fault judge then I desire where it lie 
in those that be my judge or in i 
heaven stand on my side pity love and duty 

where be they sir who see they but yourself 

not you and I be sure 
you never have the gracious eye to see they 
you think you arraign i but I hope 
to sentence you at the bar 

that will show brave 

this be the judgement seat we now 
the heavy crime that ever make up 
unnaturalness in humanity 
you be find foul and guilty by a jury 
make of your father curse which have bring 
vengeance impend on you and I now 
be force to pronounce judgement on my judge 
the common law of reason and of nature 
condemn you ipso facto you be parricide 
and if you marry will beget the liar 
who when you be grow to full maturity 
will hurry you their father to their grave 
like traitor you take counsel from the live 
of upright judgement you will rob the bench 
experience and discretion snatch away 
from the earth face turn all into disorder 
imprison virtue and enfranchise vice 
and put the sword of justice into the hand of 
boy and mad man 

well well have you do sir

Cleanthes take your place with these grave father 
and read what in that table be inscribe

and read Cleanthes to the dread and terror 
of disobedience and unnatural blood

counsel of Epire that no son and heir 
shall be hold capable of his inheritance 
at the age of one and twenty unless he be at that time 
as nature in obedience manner and goodness

I have never think to have be bring so low as my knee again but since there be no remedy father reverent father as you ever hope to have good son and heir a handful of pity we confess we have deserve more than we be willing to receive at your hand though son can never deserve too much of their father as shall appear afterward 

and what way can you decline your feed now 
you can retire to beef and mutton sure 

Alas sir you see a good pattern for that now we have lay by our high and lusty meat and be down to our many bone already 

well sir rise to virtue we will bound you now 
you that be too weak yourselves to govern 
by other shall be govern 

Cleanthes 
I meet your justice with reconcilement 
if there be tear of faith in woman breast 
I have receive a myriad which confirm i 
to find a happy renovation 

here be virtue throne 
which I will embellish with my dear jewel 
of love and faith peace and affection 
this be the altar of my sacrifice 
where daily my devote knee shall bend 
age honour shrine time still so love you 
that I so long may have you in my eye 
until my memory lose your beginning 
for you great prince long may your fame survive 
your justice and your wisdom never die 
crown of your crown the blessing of your land 
which you reach to she from your regent hand 

o Cleanthes have you with we taste 
the entertainment of our retirement 
fear and exclaim on in your ignorance 
you may have soon die upon the wonder 
then any rage or passion for our loss 
a place at hand we be all stranger in 
so sphere about with music such delight 
viand and attendance and once a day 
so cheer with a royal visitant 
that oft time wake our unsteady fantasy 
will question whether we yet live or no 
or have possession of that paradise 
where Angel be the guard 

enough Leonides 
you go beyond the praise we have our end 
and all be end well we have now see 
the flower and weed that grow about our court 

if these be weed I be afraid I shall wear none so good again as long as my father live 

only this gentleman we do abuse 
with our own bosom we seem a tyrant 
and he our instrument look it be Cratilus discover the executioner 
the man that you suppose have now be travel 
which we give leave to learn to speak 
and bring we foreign language to Greece 
all be joy I see let music be the crown 
and set it high the good needs fear no law 
it be his safety and the bad man awe
