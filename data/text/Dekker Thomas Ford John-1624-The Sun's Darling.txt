but where be the guide 
quicken thy spirit Raybright I will not leave thou 
we will run the self same race again that happiness 
these lazy sleep tedious winter night 
become not noble action 

to the spring 
I be resolve oh what strange light appear 
the sun be up sure 

wanton darling look and worship with amazement 
o gracious lord 

thy sand be number and thy glass of frailty 
 out to the last here in this mirror 
let man behold the circuit of his fortune 
the 〈◊〉 of the spring dawn like the morning 
bedew childhood with unrelished beauty 
of gawdy sight the summer as the noon 
shine in delight of youth and ripen strength 
to autumn manhood here the evening grow 
and knit up all felicity in folly 
winter at last draw on the night of age 
yet still a humour of some novel fancy 
untasted or untried put off the minute 
of resolution which shall bid farewell 
to a vain world of weariness and sorrow 
the power from who man do derive his pedigree 
of his creation with a royal bounty 
give he health youth delight for free attendant 
to rectify his carriage to be thankful 
again to they man shall cashier his riot 
his bosom whorish sweetheart idle humour 
his reason dangerous seducer folly then shall 
like four straight pillar the four element 
support the goodly structure of mortality 
then shall the four complexion like four head 
of a clear river stream in his body 
nourish and comfort every vein and sinew 
no sickness of contagion no grim death 
of deprivation of health real blessing 
shall then affright the creature build by heaven 
reserve to immortality henceforth 
in peace go to our altar and no more 
question the power of supernal greatness 
but give we leave to govern as we please 
nature and her dominion who from we 
and from our gracious influence have both be 
and preservation no reply but reverence 
man have a double guard if time can win he 
heaven power above he his own peace within he
