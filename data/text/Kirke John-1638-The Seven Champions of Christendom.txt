and memorize their happy victory 
but if they fall their ruin shall be sing 
in elegiac strain record fit 
for such untimely fatal overthrow 
however honour shall adorn their hearse 
and they still live by never die verse 

lay by your idle sport and vanity 
and send up vow and sad repentant tear 
these offend and pull down ruin on we 
to provoke the god ready to destroy we

and make death seize on thou with infamy 

let death come how he will

what over desperate and lifeweary fool 
dare meet the couch lance of this brave knight 
see the foil we take 

the cry go in our prince arbasto name 
hark another charge give they a second meeting 
it be well he keep his saddle at the first 
look to the prince there some and take he 
for fall I be sure he be before this time 

I now admire and love this venture in he 
well do young twig of a most royal bough

this whetstone make revenge edge more keen 
go forward good mischance 

twice meet this brave young prince the british knight 
and bear his body stiff against his shock 
unmoved of either stirrup or of saddle 
their shiver lance quarrel as they break 
and as they upward fly clash strong together 
and he unmoved undaunted twice appear 
as fair for victor as his stout opponent 
and have he rest there he have equal share 
the day bright honour with he

bow his plume head unto his sire 
who send he smile of joy encouragement 
address he for the three and last career 
the christian knight likewise begin couch his lance 
but as he grasp it in his manly fist 
a angry fire circle about his eye 
and from the furrow of his brow revenge 
leap forth and seize on the prince

his blood that wilful shed blood 
the law of nation wise do allow 
all joust and tournament in prince court 
for honour cause to break a friendly staff 
but not to make a butchery or shambles in court list 
therefore if I may of his jury be 
my verdict shall be give up he must die 

lord Lenon it be most certain he must die 
I love my sovereign well I love his son 
but dare not say that he deserve to die 
this stranger here come here in honour cause

and throw a cast at brave Arbasto life 
but let your sentence pass my lord have do

venom that have strike confuse terror 
throughout all my limb and pierce my armour

betwixt i and that ponderous weight that fall 
as if some castle ruin have fall down 
to crush i into nothing 

Mulciber like I walk through fire 
and as the salamander bathe in the flame 
wind his body in a stream of sulphur 
so the devour heat encompass i

the bode raven make the consort up 
and with their multitude press i to earth 
but here the air breathe cold and gentle on we 
be not yond light or be inure to darkness 
have not our eye forget their faculty 
it be light what be here a pillar and a tablet on it 
the lively taper which not only clear our eye 
so long invade with Cimmerian mist but give 
we light by view this inscription thereby 
for to unfold this dark aenigma 
Read Denis

and to make perfect the inscription

which I have wear in all my travail since 

no more of doubt Argalio and Leonides 
prepare to meet your ruin your all potent charm 
methinks I see they fly from room to room 
search the cavern and obscure vault 
to hide their guilty head from vengeance 
and this strong charm once think invincible 
when it shall vanish like a idle dream 
their confidence will plague their conscience more 
than if they have mistrust it before 

no more delay but bold let we assail

where be they flee hide thyself now Argalio 
and hide my error with thou they be vain 
as my belief be that thou have a knowledge 
above my mischief horse we on the cloud 
for nought else can prevent our imminent ruin

Remember the large stretch thought 
I have employ to arm thou can I cause 
darkness can my powerful art hide the 
bright sun in his most royal progress 
and shall it be confine by these opposer 

I can have a faith in these delusion 
let i despair and die here be a sword 
can quick ease my torment and set free 
a burthend conscience how free will my spirit 
greet the air of hell black kingdom 
there the thracian sit hard by the sullen 
water of black Styx finger his lute 
to hear who please strain hell minister 
forget their office the weary soul their torment 
the whole vault resound his echo 
thither will I hie and lay my trouble head 
upon his lap and he shall charm i 
into endless slumber 

hold brainsick man look up for thy safety 
see thou this throne by sable spirit bear 
in it we will mount so unbelieved a height 
earth shall appear a atom to thy eye 
thou shall view Cynthia in her silver sphere 
couch by Aurora on her rosy bed and make 
the sungod jealous of your love 
we will progress over the celestial orb 
thence to the wind and view the hollow cave 
where aeol fetter up the unruly brood 
then by descension please to our thought 
we will take survey of Neptune watery rule 
ride over the bosom of the ocean 
on crooked dolphin 
Amphion like strike a well tune harp 
and then to the earth again 

thou have give i a new life 
I feel a new unwonted joy assail i 
and all my sorrow vanish like those cloud 
that even but now environ we with darkness 

mount then my son and as we reach the sky 
my spirit shall salute we with sweet bay 
jove shall bow down his head to hear their lay 
and wish himself commander of their skill 
will this delight thou 

o my happy friend 

earth nor her strong hold shall not secure they 

o act of wonder we in vain pursue 
look how they raise themselves unto the cloud 
o have I wing but to overtake 
the villain devil enchanter 

ha ha ha fool to imagine you can wrong Argalio 
I pity you or else my powerful hand 
shall crush you into air 
stand and admire while we ascend a height 
above your weak thought 

yet be we happy though they escape 
our justice that we have free 
the country from contagion the people 
find this benefit already 
and hark with shout applaud this act 
of wonder let we to the queen 
and full give relation of all these accident 
then be we free for other warlike deed

those which be wrong and good deed to requite
