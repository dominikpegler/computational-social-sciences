empire ought to be the mirror of the time

that they with more speed may perform the trial

express your great art Virginia hear you 

o I conceive the occasion of this harmony 
Icilius send it I must thank his kindness 

let not Virginia wait her contemplation

have power to make your beauty populous 
your frown shall awe the world and in your smile 
great Rome shall build her happiness 
honour and wealth shall not be style companion 
but servant to your pleasure

boast your affection when lord Appius love you 

bless his great lordship I be much mistake 
let thy lord know thou advocate of lust 
all the intention of that youth be honourable 
while his be fill with sensuality

show but among they all so many scar 
as stick upon this flesh I will pardon they 

how now my lord breathless 

by your favour I have say 
mischief confound i if I can not wish 
my youth renew again with all her folly 
only to have breath enough to rail against 
these it be too short 

see gentleman what strange distraction 
your fall off from duty have beget 
in this most noble soldier you may live 
the mean of you to command a troop 
and then in other you will correct those fault 
which in yourselves you cherish every captain 
bear in his private government that form 
which king shall over their subject and to they 
shall be the like obedient we confess 
you have be distress but can you just challenge 
any commander that have surfeit 
while that your food be limit you can 

my lord I have share with they a equal for 
hunger and cold march through watery fen tune 
bear as great burden as the pioner 
when scarce the ground will bear i 

good my lord give we leave to proceed 
the punishment your captain have inflict 
be not sufficient for it can bring 
any example to succeed time 
of penance worth your fault happy 
it may in you beget a certain shame 
but it will in other a strong hope 
of the like lenity yet gentleman 
you have in one thing give i such a taste 
of your obedience when the fire be raise 
of fierce sedition and the cheek be swell 
to sound the fatal trumpet than the sight 
of this your worthy captain do disperse 
all those unfruitful humour and even then 
convert you from fierce tiger to stay man 
we therefore pardon you and do restore 
your captain to you you unto your captain

a soldier tear a elder brother wit

ere long you will take your leg to run away 

and what supply from Rome 

good store of corn 

what entertainment there 

most honourable 
especial by the lord Appius 
there be great hope that Appius will grow 
the soldier patron with what vehemency 
he urge our want and with what expedition 
he haste the supply it be almost 
incredible there be promise to the soldier 
beside their corn a bounteous donative 
but it be not certain yet when it shall be pay 

How for your own particular 

my lord 
I be not enter full two pike length

upon that evidence which I shall bring 
the business be to have warrant by arrest 
to answer such thing at the judgement bar 
as can be lay against she ere her friend 
can be assemble ere herself can study

that will ere long break out in violence 
on i and on my fortune

lord Appius will do wrong who be all justice 
the most austere and upright censurer 
that ever sit upon the awful bench 

Icilius you be near to i in blood 
and I esteem your safety as my own 
if you will needs wage eminence and state 
choose out a weak opposite not one 
that in his arm bear all the strength of Rome 

beside Icilius 
know you the danger what it be to scandal 
one of his place and sway 

I know it kinsman yet this popular greatness 
can be no bugbear to affright my innocence 
no his smooth crest have cast a palped film 
over Rome eye he juggle a plain juggler 
lord Appius be no less 

nay than cousin

to lend a face to such reproachful term 
against one of his high presence 

sit pray sit 
to see i draw his picture before your eye 
to make this man seem monstrous and this god 
Rome so adore a devil a plain devil 
this lord this judge this Appius that profess 
to all the world a vestal chastity 
be a incontinent loose lecher grow 

fie cozen 

nay it be true daily and hourly 
he tempt this blush virgin with large promise 
with melt word and present of high rate 
to be the stale to his unchaste desire 

be it possible 

possible 
it be actual truth I pray but ask your niece 

most true I be extreme tire and weary 
with message and token of his love 
no answer no repulse will satisfy 
the tediousness of his importunate suit 
and while I can with modesty and honour 
without the danger of reproach and shame 
I keep it secret from Icilius 
but when I see their boldness find no limit 
and they from fair entreaty grow to threat 
I tell he all 

true understand which 
to he I go 

to Appius 

to that giant 
the high colossus that bestride we all 
I go to he 

how do you bear yourself 

like Appius at the first dissemble 
but when I see the coast clear all withdraw 
and none but we two in the lobby than 
I draw my poniard take he by the throat 
and when he will have clamour threaten death 
unless he will with patience hear i out 

do he Icilius 

I make he that he dare not squeak 
not move a eye not draw a breath too loud 
nor stir a finger 

what succeed then 

Keep fast the door there sweet cousin not too loud 
what then succeed 

why I tell he all

a thousand thing which I have now forget 
show he his hand a witness against himself

and with a noble confidence bear all

I think thou to be Virginia man and Corbulo 

no no such matter guess again tell i but what I be or what manner of fellow you imagine i to be 

I take thou to be a honest good fellow 

wide of the bow hand still Corbulo be no such man

she be not the woman you take he to be for though she have borrow no money yet she be enter into bond and though you may think she a woman not sufficient yet it be very like her bond will be take the truth be she be challenge to be a bond woman now if she be a bond woman and a slave and I her servant and vassal what do you take i to be I be a ant a coat a worm a woodcock among bird a hodmondod among fly among cur a trindle tale and among fish a poor ipèr but among serve man worse worse than the man man to the under yeoman Fewterer 

but be it possible thy lady be challenge to be a slave what witness have they 

witness these fountain these floodgate these wellspring the poor gentlewoman be arrest in the open market I offer I offer to bail she but though she be I can not be take the grief have go so far my heart that until I be make free I shall never be my own man the lord Appius have commit she to ward and it be think she shall neither lie on the knight side not in the troping ward for if he may have his will of she he mean to put her in the Hole his warrant have be out for she but how the case stand with he or how matter will be take up with she it   be yet uncertain

that you have rather love i then my fortune 
for that be near shipwrack chance you see still range 
and this short dance of life be full of change 
Appius how hollow that name sound how dreadful 
it be a question whether the proud lecher 
will view we to our merit for they say 
his memory to virtue and good man 
be still carouse lethe o the god

who bear in bondage live and die a slave 
and see no lustful project bend upon she 
and neither know the life nor death of honour

which shall reform corruption sufficient 
to cross their black premeditate doom

be leap into his bosom 

o you god

know you the place you speak in 

I will speak free 
good man too much trust their innocence 
do not betake they to that just defence 
which god and nature give they but even wink 
in the black tempest and so fond sink 

let we proceed to sentence 

ere you speak 
one part farewell let i borrow of you 
to take of my Virginia 

now my lord 
we shall have fair confession of the truth 
pray take your course 

farewell my sweet Virginia never never 
shall I taste fruit of the most bless hope 
I have in thou let i forget the thought 
of thy most pretty infancy when first 
return from the war I take delight 
to rock thou in my target when my girl 
will kiss her father in his burganet 
of glitter steel hang about his arm neck 
and view the bright metal smile to see 
another fair Virginia smile on thou 
when I first teach thou how to go to speak 
and when my wound have smart I have sing 
with a unskilful yet a willing voice

this tediousness do much offend the court 
silence attend her sentence 

hold without sentence I will resign she free 
since you will prove she to be none of i 

see see how evident truth appear 
receive she Clodius 

thus I surrender she into the court 
of all the god and see proud Appius see 
although not just I have make her free 
and if thy lust with this act be not feed 
bury she in thy bowel now she be dead 

o horrid act 

lay hand upon the murderer 

o for a ring of pike to circle i 
what have I stand the brunt of thousand enemy 
here to be slay by hangman no I will fly 
to safety in the camp 

some pursue the villain 
other take up the body madness and rage 
be still the attendant of old dote age 

be our hut sweep clean 

as I can make it 

it be betwixt we two 
but how many think thou breed of Roman blood 
do lodge with we last night 

more I think then the camp have enemy 
they be not to be number 

comrade I fear Appius will doom we to Actaeon death 
to be worry by the cattle that we feed 
how go the day 

my stomach have strike twelve 

Come see what provant our knapsack yield 
this be our store our garner 

a small pittance 

feed Appius thus be this a city feast 
this crust do taste like date stone and this thing 
if I know what to call it 

I can tell you cheese strike in year 

I do not think but this same crust be bake 
and this cheese fright out of milk and whey 
before we two be soldier though it be old 
I see it can crawl what live thing be these 
that walk so free between the rind and pith 
for here be no sap leave 

they call they gentle 

therefore it be think fit 
that soldier by profession gentleman 
shall thus be feed with gentle I be stomach sick 
I must have some strong water 

where will you have it 

in you green ditch a place which none can pass 
but he must stop his nose thou know it well 
there where the two dead dog lie

be flay for supper though we dine today 
as dutch man feed their soldier we will sup 
brave like roman leaguerer 

sir the general 

we will give he place 
but tell none of our dainty lest we have 
too many guest to supper 

most sure it be so it can otherwise be 
either Virginius be degenerate 
from the ancient virtue he be wont to boast 
or in some strange displeasure with the senate 
why shall these letter else from Appius 
confine he a close prisoner to the camp 
and which confirm his guilt why shall he fly 
needs then must I incur some high displeasure 
for negligence to let he thus escape 
which to excuse and that it may appear 
I have no band with he but be of faction 
oppose in all thing to the least misdeed 
I will cashier he and his tribuneship 
bestow upon some noble gentleman 
belong to the camp soldier and friend 
you that beneath Virginius colour march 
by strict command from the decemvirate 
we take you from the charge of he late flee 
and his authority command and honour 
we give this worthy roman know his colour 
and prove his faithful soldier 

warlike general 
my courage and my forwardness in battle 
shall plead how well I can deserve the title 
to be a roman tribune 

now the news 

Virginius in a strange shape of distraction 
enter the camp and at his heel a legion 
of all estate growth age and degree 
with breathless pace dog his fright step 
it seem half Room be unpeople with a train 
that either for some mischief do pursue he 
or to attend some uncouth novelty 

some wonder our fear promise worthy soldier 
martial yourselves and entertain this novel 
within a ring of steel wall in this portent 
with man and harness be it never so dreadful 
he be enter by the clamour of the camp 
that entertain he with these echo shout 
affection that in soldier heart be breed 
survive the wound and out live the dead 

have I in all this populous assembly 
of soldier that have prove Virginius valour 
one friend let he come thrill his partisan 
against this breast that through a large wide wound 
my mighty soul may rush out of this prison 
to fly more free to yond crystal palace 
where honour sit enthronize what no friend 
can this great multitude then yield a enemy 
that hate my life here let he seize it free 
what no man strike be I so well belove 
Minutius then to thou if in this camp 
there live one man so just to punish sin 
so charitable to redeem from torment 
a wretched soldier at his worthy hand 
beg a death

or if the general heart be so obdure 
to a old beg soldier have I here

and settle purpose and see still I wear 
her crimson colour and these wither arm

and drag unto a public session house

your love and pity quick have take end 
great man misfortune thus have ever stand 
they touch none near but their near blood

of some loose unthrift and vile male content

to murderer to bankrupt or thief 
to fleece the common wealth 

do you term we so 
shall I reprove your rage or be it your malice

the goad or wire whip but a sweet voice

want of sleep will do it better than all these my lord 
I will not have you wake for other ruin 
lest you turn mad with watch 

o you god 
you be now a general learn to know your place 
and use your noble call modest 
better have Appius be a upright judge 
and yet a evil man then honest man 
and yet a dissolute judge for all disgrace 
light less upon the person than the place 
you be in the city now where if you raise 
but the least uproar even your father house 
shall not be free from ransack piteous fire 
that chance in tower of stone be not so fear 
as those that light in flax shop for there be food 
for eminent ruin 

o my noble lord 
let not your passion bring a fatal end 
to such a good beginning all the world 
shall honour that deed in he which first 
grow to a reconcilement 

Come my lord 
I love your friendship yes in sooth I do 
but will not seal it with that bloody hand 
join we our army no fantastic copy 
or borrow precedent will I assume 
in my revenge there be hope yet you may live 
to outwear this sorrow 

o impossible 
a minute joy to i will quite cross nature 
as those that long have dwell in noisome room 
swoon present if they but scent perfume 

to the senate Come no more of this sad tale 
for such a telltale may we term our grief 
and do as it be so listen to her own word 
envious of other sleep because she wake 
I ever will converse with a grieve person 
in a long journey to beguile the day 
or winter evening to pass time away 
march on and let proud Appius in our view 
like a tree rot fall that way he grow 

the world be change now all damnation 
seize on the Hydra head multitude 
that only gape for innovation 
o who will trust a people 

nay who will not 
rather than one rear on a popular suffrage 
who station be build on avees and applause 
there be no firm structure on these airy base 
o fie upon such greatness 

the same hand 
that yesterday to hear i conscionate 
and oratorize ring shrill plaudit forth 
in sign of grace now in contempt and scorn 
hurry i to this place of darkness 

can not their poison rather spend themselves 
on the judge folly but must it needs stretch 
to i his servant and sweep i along 
curse on the inconstant rabble 

grieve it thou 
to impart my sad disaster 

marry do it 

thou share a fortune with i in my greatness 
I hale thou after when I climb my state 
and shrink thou at my ruin 

I love your greatness 
and will have trace you in the golden path 
of sweet promotion but this your decline 
sour all these hope sweet 

it be the world right 
such gratitude a great man still shall have 
that trust unto a temporize slave 

slave good which of we two in our dejection 
be base I be most sure 
your loathsome dungeon be as dark as i 
your conscience for a thousand sentence 
wrong denounce much more oppress than i 
then which be the most slave 

o double baseness 
to hear a drudge thus with his lord compare 
great man disgrace slave to their servant be 

soldier keep a strong guard while we survey 
our sentence prisoner and from this deep dungeon 
keep off that great concourse who violent hand 
will ruin this stone building and drag hence 
this impious judge piecemeal to tear his limb 
before the law convince he 

see these monster 
who front the fair Virginia innocent blood 
have vizard with such black ugliness 
that they be loathsome to all good man soul 
speak damn judge how can thou purge thyself 
from lust and blood 

I do confess myself 
guilty of both yet hear i noble roman 
Virginius thou do but supply my place 
I thou fortune have lift thou to my chair 
and throw i headlong to thy plead bar 
if in my eminence I be stern to thou 
shun my rigor likewise shun my fall 
And be mild where I show cruelty 
establish still thy greatness make some use 
of this my bondage with indifference 
survey i and compare my yesterday 
with this sad hour my height with my decline 
and give they equal balance 

uncertain fate but yesterday his breath 
awe Rome and his least tout frown be death 
I can choose but pity and lament 
so high a rise shall have such low descent 

he be ready to forget his injury 
o too relent age think not Virginius 
if he shall pardon Appius this black deed 
and set he once more in the ivory chair 
he will be wary to avoid the like 
become a new man a more upright judge 
and deserve better of the common weal 

it be like he will 

nay if you thus begin 
I will fetch that shall anatomize his sin 

Virginius you be too remiss to punish 
deed of this nature you must fashion now 
your action to your place not to your passion 
severity to such act be as necessary 
as pity to the tear of innocence 

he speak but law and justice 
make good the street with your best man at arm 
Valerius and Horatio know the reason 
of this loud uproar and confuse noise 
although my heart be melt at the fall 
of man in place and office we will be just 
to punish murderous act and censure lust 

Icilius worthy lord bear through the street 
the body of Virginia towards this prison 
which when it be discover to the people 
move such a mournful clamour that their cry 
pierce heaven and force tear from their sorrow eye 

here come Icilius 

where be thy pity when thou slay this maid 
thou will extend to Appius pity see 
her wound still bleed at the horrid presence 
of you stern murderer till she find revenge 
nor will these drop stench or these spring be dry 
till they be set a bleed shall her soul 
who essence some suppose life in the blood 
still labour without rest will old Virginius 
murder she once again in this delay 

pause there Icilius 
this sight have stiffen all my operant power 
ice all my blood benumb my motion quite 
I will pour my soul into my daughter belly 
and with a soldier tear embalm her wound 
my only dear Virginia 

leave this passion 
proceed to your just sentence 

we will give i two sword Appius grasp this 
you Clodius that you shall be your own hangman 
do justice on yourselves you make Virginius 
sluice his own blood lodge in his daughter breast 
which your own hand shall act upon yourselves 
if you be roman and retain their spirit 
redeem a base life with a noble death 
and through your 〈◊〉 vein confine your breath 

Virginius be a noble justicer 
have I my crooked path level by thou 
I have not sway the balance think not lord 
but he that have the spirit to oppose the god 
dare likewise suffer what their power inflict 
I have not dread famine fire nor strage 
their common vengeance poison in my cup 
nor dagger in my bosom the revenge 
of private man for private injury 
nay more than these not fetter to commit evil 
and shall I tremble at the punishment 
now with as much resolve constancy 
as I offend will I pay the mulct 
and this black stain lay on my family 
than which a noble have not place in Rome 
wash with my blood away Learn of i Clodius 
I will teach thou what thou never study yet 
that be brave how to die judge be term 
the god on earth and such as be corrupt 
read i in this my ruin those that succeed i 
that so offend thus punish This the sum of all 
Appius that sin by Appius hand shall fall 

he die as bold as he base err 
and so shall every true breed Roman do 
and he who lise be odious thus expire 
in his death force pity Clodius thou 
be follower of his fortune in his be 
therefore in his not be imitate 
his fair example 

death be terrible 
unto a conscience that be oppress with guilt 
they say there be Elysium and hell 
the first I have forfeit the latter fear 
my skin be not sword proof 

why do thou pause 

for mercy mercy I entreat you all 
be it not sufficient for Virginia slay 
that Appius suffer one of noble blood 
and eminence in place for a plebeian 
beside he be my lord and may command i 
if I do aught it be by compulsion lord 
and therefore I crave mercy 

shall I doom he 

do good Icilius 

then I sentence thus 
thou have a mercy most unmeriting slave 
of which thy base birth be not capable 
which we take off by take thence thy sword 
and note the difference betwixt a noble strain 
and one breed from the rabble both alike 
dare to transgress but see their odds in death 
Appius die like a roman gentleman 
and a man both way know but this slave 
be only sensible of vicious live 
not apprehensive of a noble death 
therefore as a base malefactor we 
and timorous slave give he as he deserve 
unto the common hangman 

what no mercy 

stop his mouth 
away with he the life of the decemviri 
expire in they Rome thou at length art free 
restore unto thy ancient liberty 

of consul which bold junius Brutus first 
begin in Tarquin fall Virginius you 
and young Icilius shall his place succeed 
so by the people suffrage it be decree 

we martial than our soldier in that name 
of consul honour with these golden bay 
two fair but lady most infortunate 
have in their ruin raise decline Rome 
Lucretia and Virginia both renown 
for chastity soldier and noble roman 
to grace her death who life have free great Rome 
march with her course to her sad funeral tomb
