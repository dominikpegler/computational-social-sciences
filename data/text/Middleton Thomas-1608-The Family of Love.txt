to such as do pursue variety 
but unto those who modest thought do tend 
to honour nuptial and a regular life 
as far from show of niceness as from that 
of impure thought all other object seem 
respectless of no proportion balance with esteem 
of what their soul affect 

no marvel sure you shall regard these man with such reverend opinion there be few good face and few grace in any of they if one among a multitude have a good pair of leg he never leave ride the ring till he have quite mar the proportion nay some as I have hear want lineament to their like and calf to support themselves be fain to use art and supply themselves with quilt calf which oftentimes in revel fall about their ankle and for their behaviour wit and discourse except some few that be travel it be as imperfectious and silly as your scholar new come from the university by this light I think we lose part of our happiness when we make these weathercock our equal 

disgrace not that for which our sect be make 
society in nuptial bed above these joy 
which lover taste when their conjoin lip 
suck forth each other soul the earth the air 
yea god themselves know none Elysium sweet

and mount aloft the ocean in his source 
may easy hide himself and be confine 
then love can be obscure for in the mind 
she hold her seat and through that heavenly essence 
be near when far remote her virtual presence 
fill like the air all place give delight 
hope in despair and heart against fell despite 
that worst of man thy cruel guardian may 
keep down a while but can dissipate
