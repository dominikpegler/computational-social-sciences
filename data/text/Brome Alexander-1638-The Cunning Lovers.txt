and that my lord be the full end of a sentence but shall we give over travel till we have see something worth see 

worth see say thou what be Valentia 
travel from pole to pole stand at the centre 
and progress round about the spacious sign 
or be it possible sit with the sun 
in his high noontide glory and from thence 
survey the kingdom of this low world 
thou can not find her match Apollo hair 
be dull to she her finger hand eye front 

take i with you my lord this marvellous thing you call her beauty be it aught but ordinary flesh and blood be those gold wiry hair with which Apollo may go string his harp be they aught but the plain hair of her head her ivory palm that do in touch melt embroider with blue artery be it aught but a lady hand and finger and this strange thing this wonder of the world who peer can be find between the pole be not all these nine wonder in one she that be here even now the duke daughter Valentia 

o my dear Montecelso this I know 
but such a admiration have surprise 
the freedom of my sense that it rob i 
of my true judgement 

be advise by i you love this lady but so strict be like to be her imprisonment that you may as easy pass by the gate that Cerberus keep as through the door of this castle you be already in favour with the duke do but prefer i to be overseer of the work if I do not work it so that I will bring you to oversee she turn i out of my office as one not worthy the name of a architecture 

I shall commend thou for a man well skilled a such great structure it may be the duke may trust i on my word 

and if I do not make he dote as much on you for your valour as you make he enamour on i for my skill in building may this tower turn to the tower of Babel and make a second confusion between we there remain for you nothing but this to win the favour of the lady and for your access to she if I do not teach you to counterfeit all the duke key turn by all the ward of his lock and lay open all the jury of his twelve door that he have panel against your entrance report i to be no man of my trade away my lord leave this melancholy walk by her window and cast sheep eye that way towards her chamber let i alone to stand sentinel and watch if the duke come exeunt 

Come on my master the duke have appoint i to be overseer of his work the build of this tower be put to my indiscretion therefore come every one of you and from i take your direction what be you 

I be a free mason and expert in square stone 

a good proper square fellow if your trade be in stone 
I make no question but you will work hard 

I warrant you sir I will do my endeavour will you give we direction 

first you must make a fair large post at the entry 

I warrant you I will make a large porch that any lady shall go in and out at pleasure 

to see how you mistake you must make it that nobody can go in and out at pleasure but only my lady it must be too wide for any that be less than she and too straight for any that be great than she you conceive i 
o sir it be not possible 

tell not i of possible such direction I have and such a one I must have make then must I have fair bay window that must always stand open and give no light that they that stand without and look in may see nobody within and she that stand within and look out may see nobody without the reason be my lord mean to keep his daughter in that tower where she must neither see nor be see 

then none must offer to look out from the inside nor in from the outside else it be not within the compass of workmanship 

tell not i of workmanship such window I must have make now carpenter for you you must make the door of that fashion that woman may go in but man may not and they must be of such wood as will not let a lover come near it for my lord will have no lover come near his castle 

then you must have somebody to keep they out here be wise direction 

for you goodman padlock you must hammer out your lock and key with such art that if the duke or any from he offer to open the key may turn at pleasure but if any lover or suspicious person come to enter nonsum non possum non licet esse domi 

that be as much as to say they must have no entrance there 

smith you have hit the nail on the head what be your place 

I have the charge of the brickwork and must build the chimney if you will give i direction 

marry will I sir you must have a special regard in your chimney that they cast heat though there be no fire in they and the kitchen chimney especial must every meal yield roast meat without send to market and so to work for a spurt and after merry to dinner 

a good motion exeunt 

have you give charge lord julio that my duchess 
be noble serve as she who Mantua love 

I have my lord 

and that Valentia be enclose and shut 
from all her suitor eye 

I give such order 

enough now my lord 

you give we fair word but keep we from the sight of the fair lady 

soft and fair soft and fair 

we know they be both soft and fair and that be the reason we desire so much both to see and feel they 

I will beneath the ground sell of this castle 
by miner craft be place some strong petard 
to which I will give fire and blow this structure 
up into air that prison thus my love 
but julio peace and some advantage wait 
to show to she thy love to he thy hate 

my lord I can compare you to none so right as to the king Aerifius that shut up his daughter Danae in a brazen tower but you know the end of it there be a Jupiter that with a golden picklock break through those brazen gate and make the maid a mother now if 
I be to choose a godhead of all the god that be 
will I for her sake wish to be a Jupiter 

for man to be make god it be a wonder 
you jove and neither have his power nor thunder 

shall I bail she my lord I will put you in good security 

but not in better security than I have put she in already 
yet better will do well o for a man 
skilful in architecture and compose 
strong frame and form of building 

now be my question 
my lord there be a stranger in your court 
who outside though it promise not much art 
yet be he so ingenious and so apt 
of such opinion and direction too 
that can you win he to be so employ 
as we shall hardly for man excellent 
be curious of their skill you can find 
a man to match his skill in Italy 

thou be I see fair knight mark in thy cradle 
to do i all good office bring that man 
to my employment I will guerdon he 
with more than he can ask 

ay but my lord 
he be a man always so absolute 
and stand so much upon his excellence 
in fine contrive and rare edifice

rich Crassus house at Rome Diana temple 
at Ephesus nor the grand city Cairo 
it be well for they that be no traveller 
see you i draw a form or a fine model 
the fabric great will enamour you 
but yet it be well enough pretty not famous 

shall I entreat you to direct my workman 
and I will weigh your pain down with reward 

your tower as it be my lord will serve the turn 
be fine seat and to keep your daughter 
close from the eye of stranger well contrive

so most man be in thing they best excel 
shall I prevail fair sir

to end that frame your workman have begin 
I have peruse the situation 
find it secure and full of able trust 
yet one defect I find can you pick out 
some noble knight who valour do exceed 
to build for he a lodging near that tower 
where fair Valentia be to live enclose 
he as a guardian or a sentinel 
may keep continual watch defend the passage 
and keep the place strong and impregnable 

where shall I find a man worthy that place 
who valour may supply this my employment 

let i engage my person to that business 

accept of i my lord I will be her guardian 

let the Ferrara marquis be employ 
in this adventure 

list to i my lord 
amongst other quest once as I travel Greece

I see a knight now resident in court 
do such high deed of arm that live Hector

And be it not as well second of i to say in my sleep I love none but the duke sure it must be in my sleep if ever I love he for yet I can never endure he wake but what shall we do 

by my counsel let we even go to bed like love bedfellow and see if we can dream of they that in time may become our love bedfellow 

with all my heart now the duke be confident of our affection we may be the free in the entertain of those who we best affect come come let we leave talk of this counterfeit sleep and see if we can take a nap in sadness 

content and let all man learn thus much from we that sleep or wake it be hard to overreach a woman exeunt 

yet all thing go currant if the lady be as nimble in their excuse as we be quick in our passage through the private door I hope neither the duke nor any of his court can any way trace we in our proceed some lover will think i a most happy creature to enjoy the love of so beautiful a lady and for aught I know I may be so but I have make a vow never to marry a wife but first to make some perfect and sound trial of her affection towards i but because there be no woman that love a man live but she will infinite lament he dead it shall be think that I have drown myself of which I will give the court some assure instance and afterward live hereabout in some odd disguise I shall true understand how she take my death if in any extremity of grief I will revive she with as great a surplusage of joy but if she take it cold as a business that little concern she I will leave she to the mercy of he that bid fair for she and to my plot I stay but for some company that may see i throw myself desperate into the river hear my passion and report it 

my work and every thing belong to the duke building be bring to some good pass I will study how to pass the time and for the better recreation of my dull spirit take a turn or two here by the river side to contemplate of the beauty of my mistress for indeed I be late fall in love 

no fit man in the world to be the reporter of my death than this coxcomb 

upon a morning when I rise to breakfast like a glutton 
I don my doublet and my hose and eat two leg of mutton 
her bonny look forget I not nor tooth as white as amber 
her face do shine like pewterpot belong to the chamber 
my lovely mistress I espy as she a milk go a 
but o methinks at every stride her smock that she have rend a 
full pale she look for on her head a milkpail be well place 
her lip be white her brow be red her body be straightlaced 
but shall I now describe her leg for I dare look no high 
she go as if she tread on egg most soft through the mire 

now to my passion 

but o a place beside all these above both knee and thigh a 
which spring as she look for flea do make my stomach rise a 

let Jove threat thunder or bright Juno scold 
mar threaten arm arm in cyclopian steel 
he to my heel clap Boreas brazen wing 
or mount on the back of Mercury 
with great terror scale the Olympic heaven 
then when the giant muster here on earth 
and dart mountain top at Jupiter 

what mad fellow be this he have drive i quite out of my meditation pray heaven I fall not into his fegary 

but o my beauteous duchess cause of this 
my frenzy lunacy rage and despair 
I love thou dear yet because my fervour 
shall no way cross the noble Mantuan duke 
I be resolve to die 

of all the trade that be I love not this die poor gentleman will the duke know as much but if love put a man into these perplexity I will take heed how I meddle with it I will even shake hand with it and part with it as it come 

who do I see the duke of Mantua joy 
she who bright beauty enamour Jove himself 
and make he from his crystal throne descend 
to bide with this fair mortal thou be she 

not I I assure you I be a man and no woman if you will not believe i I have a warrant about i to show 

Come thou be she will thou dissemble love

and stay upon thy chin thou be my duchess 
but stay I will place this border right again 
and set it on thy front where it shall stand 

o sir I will bring the duke own barber that shall take his oath upon a corporal book that this be a beard and no periwig I be he that be overseer of the duke work and not the fair duchess that you take i for put on your spectacle and you will see I be nothing like she 

then she be lose and I undo withal 
therefore I will strip i to the ivory skin 
and as Leander do lively leap in 
my head beneath yond river I will run 
Neptune spread wide thy arm for now I come Exit run 

o save the man save the man now he flounce now he flounder yet he swim above water like a walnut shell yet he sprawl like a naked frog yet he strive for life o save the man save the man but now now now he sink by degree now he be swallow now he be choke this be my comfort he can choose but go with a clean soul to heaven it will be so wash in the water before he come thither again again again now he lie still upon his back and float along with the tide and now his soul be in the sky he do not offer so much as to strive against the stream but swim as gentle down with the tide as may be but what a fool be he that know he shall go so long a journey by water and the weather so can too will leave his clothes behind he well I will even take up his scatter apparel carry they to the court and there report what I have hear and see the poor gentleman be well onward of his journey by this time they have need provide he good store of faggot for he will be monstrous wet when he come to his inn
