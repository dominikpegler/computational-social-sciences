fortune not reason rule the state of thing 
reward go backward honour on his head 
who be not poor be monstrous only need 
give form and worth to every humane seed 
as cedar beat with incessant storm 
so great man flourish and do imitate 
unskilful statuary who suppose 
in forge a colossus if they make he 
straddle enough strut and look big and gape 
their work be goodly so our tympanous statist 
in their affect gravity of voice 
sourness of countenance manner cruelty 
authority wealth and all the spawn of fortune 
think they bear all the kingdom worth before they 
yet differ not from those colossic statue 
which with heroic form without overspread 
within be nought but mortar flint and lead 
man be a torch bear in the wind a dream 
but of a shadow sum with all his substance 
and as great seaman use all their power 
and skill in Neptune deep invisible path 
in tall ship rich build and rib with brass 
to put a girdle round about the world 
when they have do it come near their haven 
be glad to give a warn piece and call 
a poor stay fisherman that never pass 
his country sight to waft and guide they in 
so when we wander further through the wave 
of glassy glory and the gulf of state 
top with all title spread all our reach 
as if each private arm will sphere the world 
we must to virtue for her guide resort 
or we shall shipwreck in our safe port procumbit 

there be no second place in numerous state 
that hold more than a cypher in a king 
all place be contain his word and look 
be like the flash and the bolt of jove 
his deed inimitable like the sea 
that shut still as it open and leave no tract 
nor print of precedent for poor man fact 
there be but a thread betwixt i and a crown 
I will not wish it cut unless by nature 
yet to prepare i for that likely fortune 
it be fit I get resolve spirit about i 
I follow D'Ambois to this green retreat 
a man of spirit beyond the reach of fear 
who discontent with his neglect worth 
neglect the light and love obscure abode 
but he be young and haughty apt to take 
fire at advancement to bear state and flourish 
in his rise therefore shall my bounty shine 
none loathe the world so much nor love to scoff it 
but gold and grace will make he surfeit of it 
what D'Ambois 

he sir 

turn to earth alive 
up man the sun shine on thou 

let it shine 
I be no mote to play in it as great man be 

think thou man great in state mote in the sun 
they say so that will have thou freeze in shade 
that like the gross sicilian gourmandist 
empty their nose in the cate they love 
that none may eat but they do thou but bring 
light to the banquet fortune set before thou 
and thou will loathe lean darkness like thy death 
who will believe thy mettle can let sloth 
rust and consume it if Themistocles 
have live obscure thus in the Athenian state 
Xerxes have make both he and it his slave 
if brave Camillus have lurk so in Rome 
he have not five time be dictator there 
nor four time triumph if Epaminondas 
who live twice twenty year obscure in Thebes 
have live so still he have be still unname 
and pay his country nor himself their right 
but put forth his strength he rescue both 
from imminent ruin and like burnish steel 
after long use he shine for as the light 
not only serve to show but render we 
mutual profitable so our life 
in act exemplary not only win 
ourselves good name but do to other give 
matter for virtuous deed by which we live 

what will you wish i do 

leave the trouble stream 
and live as thriver do at the well head 

at the well head alas what shall I do 
with that enchant glass see devil there 
or like a strumpet learn to set my look 
in a eternal brake or practise juggle 
to keep my face still fast my heart still loose 
or bear like dame schoolmistress their riddle 
two tongue and be good only for a shift 
flatter great lord to put they still in mind 
why they be make lord or please portly lady 
with a good carriage tell they idle tale 
to make their physic work spend a man life 
in sight and visitation that will make 
his eye as hollow as his mistress heart 
to do none good but those that have no need 
to gain be forward though you break for haste 
all the commandment ere you break your fast 
but believe backwards make your period 
and creed last article I believe in God 
and hear villainy preach to unfold their art 
learn to commit they it be a great man part 
shall I learn this there 

no thou need not learn 
thou have the theory now go there and practise 

ay in a threadbare suit when man come there 
they must have high nap and go from thence bare 
a man may drown the part often rich man 
in one poor suit brave bark and outward gloss 
attract court eye be in part never so gross 

thou shall have gloss enough and all thing fit 
to enchase in all show thy long smother spirit 
be rule by i then the rude scythian 
paint blind fortune powerful hand with wing 
to show her gift come swift and sudden 
which if her favourite be not swift to take

stay but a while here and I will send to thou 

what will he send some crown it be to sow they 
upon my spirit and make they spring a crown 
worth million of the feed crown he will send 
but he be no husband here a smooth plain ground 
will never nourish any politic seed 
I be for honest action not for great 
if I may bring up a new fashion 
and rise in court with virtue speed his plow 
the king have know i long as well as he 
yet can my fortune never fit the length 
of both their understanding till this hour 
there be a deep nick in time restless wheel 
for each man good when which nick come it strike 
as rhetoric yet work not persuasion 
but only be a mean to make it work 
so no man rise by his real merit 
but when it cry clink in his raiser spirit 
many will say that can rise at all 
man first hour rise be first step to his fall 
I will venture that man that fall low must die 
as well as man cast headlong from the sky

in all observance make semigod 
of their great noble and of their old queen

assure you cousin Guise so great a courtier 
so full of majesty and royal part 
no queen in Christendom may boast herself 
her court approve it that be a court indeed 
not mix with rudeness use in common house 
but as court shall be the abstract of their kingdom 
in all the beauty state and worth they hold 
so be she ample and by she inform 
the world be not contract in a man 
with more proportion and expression 
than in her court her kingdom our french court 
be a mere mirror of confusion to it 
the king and subject lord and every slave 
dance a continual hay our room of state 
keep like our stable no place more observe 
than a rude market place and though our custom 
keep this assure deformity from our sight 
it be never the less essential unsightly 
which they will soon see will they change their form 
to this of we and then compare they both 
which we must not affect because in kingdom 
where the king change do breed the subject terror 
pure innovation be more gross than error 

no question we shall see they imitate 
though afar off the fashion of our court 
as they have ever ape we in attire 
never be man so weary of their skin 
and apt to leap out of themselves as they 
who when they travel to bring forth rare man 
come home deliver of a fine french suit 
their brain lie with their tailor and get baby 
for their most complete issue he be first bear 
to all the moral virtue that first greet 
the light with a new fashion which become they 
like ape disfigure with the attire of man 

no question they much wrong their real worth 
in affectation of outlandish scum 
but they have fault and we they foolishproud

we proud that they be proud of foolery

his great heart will not down it be like the sea

partly the star daily and nightly motion 
ardour and light and partly of the place 
the diverse frame and chief by the moon 
bristle with surge never will be win 
no not when the heart of all those power be burst 
to make retreat into his settle home 
till he be crown with his own quiet foam

out of doubt some new denizen lord and think that suit come new out of the mercer book 

I have hear of a fellow that by a fix imagination look upon a bullbaiting have a visible pair of horn grow out of his forehead and I believe this gallant overioy with the conceit of monsieurs cast suit imagine himself to be the monsieur 

and why not as well as the ass stalk in the lion case bear himself like a lion roar all the huge beast out of the forest 

peace he look this way 

marry let he look sir what will you say now if the Guise be go to fetch a blanket for he

Come sir we will lead you a dance exeunt 

this desperate quarrel spring out of their envy 
to D'Ambois sudden bravery and great spirit 

neither be worth their envy 

less than either 
will make the gall of envy overflow 
she feed on outcast entrails like a kite 
in which foul heap if any ill lie hide 
she stick her beak into it shake it up 
and hurl it all abroad that all may view it 
corruption be her nutriment but touch she 
with any precious ointment and you kill she 
when she find any filth in man she feast 
and with her black throat bruit it through the world 
be sound and healthful but if she but taste 
the slender pittance of commend virtue 
she surfeit of it and be like a fly 
that pass all the body sound part 
and dwell upon the sore or if her squint eye 
have power to find none there she forge some 
she make that crooked ever which be straight 
call valour giddiness justice tyranny 
a wise man may shun she she not herself 
whither soever she fly from her harm 
she bear her foe still clasp in her own arm 
and therefore cousin Guise let we avoid she 
what Atlas or Olympus lift his head 
so far past covert that with air enough 
my word may be inform and from his height 
I may be see and hear through all the world 
a tale so worthy and so fraught with wonder 
stick in my jaw and labour with event 

come thou from D'Ambois 

from he and the rest 
his friend and enemy who stern fight I see 
and hear their word before and in the fray 

relate at large what thou have see and hear 

I see fierce D'Ambois and his two brave friend 
enter the field and at their heel their foe 
which be the famous soldier Barrisor 
L'anou and Pyrrhot great in deed of arm 
all which arrive at the even piece of earth 
the field afford the three challenger 
turn head draw all their rapier and stand rank 
when face to face the three defendant meet they 
alike prepare and resolute alike 
like bonfire of contributory wood 
every man look show feed with either spirit 
as one have be a mirror to another 
like form of life and death each take from other 
and so be life and death mix at their height 
that you can see no fear of death for life 
nor love of life for death but in their brow 
Pyrrho opinion in great letter shine 
that life and death in all respect be one 

past there no sort of word at their encounter 

as Hector betwixt the host of Greece and Troy 
when Paris and the spartan king shall end 
the nine year war hold up his brazen lance 
for signal that both host shall cease from arm 
and hear he speak so Barrisor advise 
advance his naked rapier betwixt both side 
rip up the quarrel and compare six life 
then lay in balance with six idle word 
offer remission and contrition too 
or else that he and D'Ambois may conclude 
the other danger D'Ambois like the last 
but Barrisor friend be equal engage 
in the main quarrel never will expose 
his life alone to that they all deserve 
and for the other offer of remission 
D'Ambois that like a laurel put in fire 
sparkle and spit do much much more than scorn 
that his wrong shall incense he so like chaff 
to go so soon out and like light paper 
approve his spirit at once both fire and ash 
so draw they lot and in they fate appoint 
that Barrisor shall fight with fiery D'Ambois 
Pyrhot with Melinell with Brisac L'anou 
and then like flame and powder they commix 
so sprightly that I wish they have be spirit 
that the never shut wound they needs must open 
may as they open shut and never kill 
but D'Ambois sword that lighten as it fly 
shoot like a point comet at the face 
of manly Barrisor and there it stick 
thrice pluck he at it and thrice draw on thrust 
from he that of himself be free as fire 
who thrust still as he pluck yet past belief 
he with his subtle eye hand body scape 
at last the deadly bite point tug off 
on fall his yet undaunted foe so fierce 
that only make more horrid with his wound 
great D'Ambois shrink and give a little ground 
but soon return redouble in his danger 
and at the heart of Barrisor seal his anger 
then as in Arden I have see a oak 
long shake with tempest and his lofty top 
bend to his root which be at length make loose 
even groan with his weight he begin to nod 
this way and that as loath his curl brow 
which he have oft wrap in the sky with storm 
shall stoop and yet his radical fever be burst 
stormlike he fall and hide the fearcold earth 
So fall stout Barrisor that have stand the shock 
often set battle in your highness war 
against the sole soldier of the world Navarre 

o piteous and horrid murder 

such a life 
methinks have mettle in it to survive 
a age of man 

such often soon end 
thy feel report call on we long to know 
on what event the other have arrive 

sorrow and fury like two opposite fume 
meet in the upper region of a cloud 
at the report make by this worthy fall 
break from the earth and with they rise revenge 
enter with fresh power his two noble friend 
and under that odds fall surcharge Brisac 
the friend of D'Ambois before fierce L'anou 
which D'Ambois see as I once do see 
in my young travel through Armenia 
a angry unicorn in his full carrier 
charge with too quick a eye a jeweller 
that watch he for the treasure of his brow 
and ere he can get shelter of a tree 
nail he with his rich antler to the earth 
so D'Ambois run upon revenge L'anou 
who eye the eager point bear in his face 
and give back fall back and in his fall 
his foe uncurb sword stop in his heart 
by which time all the life string of the two other 
be cut and both fall as their spirit fly 
upward and still hunt honour at the view 
and now of all the six sole D'Ambois stand 
untouched save only with the other blood 

all slay outright 

all slay outright but he 
who kneel in the warm life of his friend 
all feeble with the blood his rapier reign 
he kiss their pale cheek and bid both farewell 
and see the brave man the french earth bear 

now be the time you be princely vow my friend 
perform it princely and obtain my pardon 

else heaven forgive not i come on brave friend 
if ever nature hold herself her own 
when the great trial of a king and subject 
meet in one blood both from one belly spring 
now prove her virtue and her greatness one 
or make the the one the great with the tother 
as true king shall and for your brother love 
which be a special species of true virtue 
do that you can not do not be a king 

brother I know your suit these wilful murder 
be ever past our pardon 

manly slaughter 
shall never bear the account of wilful murder 
it be a spice of justice where with life 
offend past law equal life be lay 
in equal balance to scourge that offence 
by law of reputation which to man 
exceed all positive law and what that leave 
to true man valour not prefix right 
of satisfaction suit to their wrong 
a free man eminence may supply and take 

this will make every man that think he wrong 
or be offend or in wrong or right 
lay on this violence and all vaunt themselves 
lawmender and supplier though mere butcher 
shall this fact though of justice be forgive 

o no my lord it will make coward fear 
to touch the reputation of full man 
when only they be leave to imp the law 
justice will soon distinguish murderous mind 
from just revenger have my friend be slay 
his enemy survive he shall die 
since he have add to a murder fame 
which be in his intent a murder man 
and this have worthy be wilful murder 
but my friend only save his fame dear life 
which be above life take the under value 
which in the wrong it do be forfeit to he 
and in this fact only preserve a man 
in his uprightness worthy to survive 
million of such as murder man alive 

well brother rise and raise your friend withal 
from death to life and D'Ambois let your life 
refine by pass through this merit death 
be purge from more such foul pollution 
nor on your escape nor valour more presume 
to be again so violent 

my lord 
I loathe as much a deed of unjust death 
as law itself do and to tyrannize 
because I have a little spirit to date 
and power to do as to be tyrannize 
this be a grace that on my knee redouble 
I crave to double this my short life gift 
and shall your royal bounty centuple 
that I may so make good what God and nature 
have give i for my good since I be free 
offend no just law let no law make 
by any wrong it do my life her slave 
when I be wrong and that law fail to right i 
let i be king myself as man be make 
and do a justice that exceed the law 
if my wrong pass the power of single valour 
to right and expiate then be you my king 
and do a right exceed law and nature 
who to himself be law no law do need 
offend no king and be a king indeed 

enjoy what thou intreat we give but we

I have obtain a kingdom with my friend Exit 

he will have pardon sure 

it be pity else 
for though his great spirit something overflow 
all fault be still bear that from greatness grow 
but such a sudden courtier see I never 

he be too sudden which indeed be rudeness 

true for it argue his no due conceit 
both of the place and greatness of the person 
nor of our sex all which we all be stranger 
to his encounter shall have make more manner 
deserve more welcome 

all this fault be find 
because he love the duchess and leave you 

alas love give her joy I be so far 
from envy of her honour that I swear 
have he encounter i with such proud sleight 
I will have put that project face of he 
to a more test than do her duchessship 

why by your leave my lord I will speak it here 
although she be my aunt she scarce be modest 
when she perceive the duke she husband take 
those late exception to her servant courtship 
to entertain he 

ay and stand he still 
let her husband give her servant place 
though he do manly she shall be a woman 
D'Ambois be pardon where be a king where law 
see how it run much like a turbulent sea 
here high and glorious as it do contend 
to wash the heaven and make the star more pure 
and here so low it leave the mud of hell

as sure bind with their sleep yet there be one 
that sit above who eye no sleep can bind

I charge thou utter even with all the freedom 
both of thy noble nature and thy friendship 
the full and plain state of i in thy thought 

what utter plain what I think of you 
why this swim quite against the stream of greatness 
great man will rather hear their flattery 
and if they be not make fool be not wise 

I be no such great fool and therefore charge thou 
even from the root of thy free heart display i 

since you affect it in such serious term 
if yourself first will tell i what you think 
as free and as hearty of i 
I will be as open in my thought of you 

a bargain of my honour and make this 
that prove we in our full dissection 
never so foul live still the sound friend 

what else sir come begin and speak i simple 

I will I swear I think thou then a man 
that dare as much as a wild horse or tiger 
as headstrong and as bloody and to feed 
the ravenous wolf of thy most cannibal valour 
rather than not employ it thou will turn 
hackster to any whore slave to a jew 
or english usurer to force possession 
and cut man throat of mortgage estate 
or thou will tire thou like a tinker wife 
and murder market folk quarrel with sheep 
and run as mad as Aiax serve a butcher 
do any thing but kill of the king 
that in thy valour thou be like other natural 
that have strange gift in nature but no soul 
diffuse quite through to make they of a piece 
but stop at humour that be more absurd 
childish and villainous than that hackster whore 
slave cutthroat tinker bitch compare before 
and in those humour will envy betray 
slander blaspheme change each hour a religion 
do any thing but kill of the king 
that in that valour which be still my dunghill 
to which I carry all filth in thy house 
thou be more ridiculous and vainglorious 
than any mountebank and impudent 
than any paint bawd which not to soothe 
and glorify thou like a jupiter Hammon 
thou eat thy heart in vinegar and thy gall 
turn all thy blood to poison which be cause 
of that tadpole that stand in thy complexion 
and make thou with a cold and earthy moisture 
which be the dam of putrefaction 
as plague to thy damn pride rot as thou live 
to study calumny and treachery 
to thy friend slaughter like a screechowl sing 
and to all mischief but to kill the king 

So have you say 

how think thou do I flatter 
speak I not like a trusty friend to thou 

that ever any man be bless withal 
so here be for i I think you be at worst 
no devil since you be like to be no king 
of which with any friend of you I will lay 
this poor stillado here against all the star 
ay and against all your treachery which be more 
that you do never good but to do ill 
but ill of all sort free and for itself 
that like a murder piece make lane in army 
the first man of a rank the whole rank fall 
if you have once wrong one man you be so far 
from make he amends that all his race 
friend and associate fall into your chase 
that you be for perjury the very prince 
of all intelligencer and your voice 
be like a eastern wind that where it fly 
knit net of caterpillar with which you catch 
the prime of all the fruit the kingdom yield 
that your political head be the curse fount 
of all the violence rapine cruelty 
tyranny and atheism flow through the realm 
that you have a tongue so scandalous it will cut 
a perfect crystal and a breath that will 
kill to that wall a spider you will jest 
with God and your soul to the devil tender 
for lust kiss horror and with death engender 
that your foul body be a lernaean fen 
of all the malady breed in all man 
that you be utter without a soul 
and for your life the thread of that be spin 
when Clotho sleep and let her breathe rock 
fall in the dirt and Lachesis still draw it 
dip she twist finger in a bowl 
defile and crown with virtue force soul 
and last which I must for gratitude 
ever remember that of all my height 
and dear life you be the only spring 
only in royal hope to kill the king

so woman that of all thing make of nothing 
be the most perfect image of the moon 
or stillunweaned sweet mooncalf with white face 
not only be pattern of change to man 
but as the tender moonshine of their beauty 
clear or be cloudy make man glad or sad 

but here the moon be change as the king note 
and either man rule in they or some power 
beyond their voluntary motion 
for nothing can recover their lose face 

none can be always one our grief and joy 
hold several sceptre in we and have time 
for their predominance which grief now in they 
do claim as proper to his diadem 
and grief be a natural sickness of the blood 
that time to part ask as his come have 
only sleight fool grieve sudden be glad 
a man may say to a dead man be revive 
as well as to one sorrowful be not grieve 
and therefore princely mistress in all war

who be fate minister 

the Guise and Monsieur 

a fit pair of shears

bind i and force it or I lay my soul 
she rather will convert it many time 
on her own bosom even to many death 
but be there danger of such violence 
I know it be far from her intent to send 
and who she shall send be as far from thought 
since he be dead who only mean she use 
who be there look to the door and let he in 
though politic monsieur or the violent Guise 

Haile to my worthy son 

o lie spirit welcome love father 
how fare my dear mistress 

well as ever 
be well as ever think on by her lord 
whereof she send this witness in her hand 
and pray for urgent cause your speedy presence 

what write in blood 

ay it be the ink of lover 

o it be a sacred witness of her love 
so much elixir of her blood as this 
drop in the light dame will make her firm 
as heat to fire and like to all the sign 
command the life confine in all my vein 
oh how it multiply my blood with spirit 
and make i apt to encounter death and hell 
but come kind father you fetch i to heaven 
and to that end your holy weed be give Exit 

now shall we see that nature have no end 
in her great work responsive to their worth 
that she who make so many eye and soul 
to see and foresee be stark blind herself 
and as illiterate man say latin prayer 
by root of heart and daily iteration 
in who hot zeal a man will think they know 
what they run so away with and be sure 
to have reward proportion to their labour 
yet may implore their own confusion 
for any thing they know which oftentimes 
it fall out they incur so nature lay 
a mass of stuff together and by use 
or by the mere necessity of matter 
end such a work fill it or leave it empty 
of strength or virtue error or clear truth 
not know what she do but usual 
give that which we call merit to a man 
and believe shall arrive he on huge riches 
honour and happiness that effect his ruin 
right as in ship of war whole last of powder 
be lay man think to make they last and guard they 
when a disorder spark that powder take 
blow up with sudden violence and horror 
ship that keep empty have sail long with terror 

he that observe but like a worldly man 
that which do oft succeed and by the event 
value the worth of thing will think it true 
that nature work at random just with you 
but with as much decorum she may make 
a thing that from the foot up to the throat 
have all the wondrous fabric man shall have 
and leave it headless for a absolute man 
as give a whole man valour virtue learning 
without a end more excellent than those 
on who she no such worthy part bestow 

why you shall see it here here will be one 
young learned valiant virtuous and full man 
one on who nature spend so rich a hand 
that with a ominous eye she weep to see 
so much consume her virtuous treasury 
yet as the wind sing through a hollow tree 
and since it let they pass through let it stand 
but a tree solid since it give no way 
to their wild rage they rend up by the root 
so this full creature now shall reel and fall 
before the frantic puff of purblind chance 
that pipe through empty man and make they dance 
not so the sea rave on the lybian sand 
tumble her billow in each other neck 
not so the surge of the euxine sea 
near to the frosty pole where free Boötes 
from those darkdeep wave turn his radiant team 
swell be enrage even from their inmost drop 
as fortune swing about the restless state 
of virtue now throw into all man hate 
revive those stupid thought and sit not thus 
gather the horror of your servant slaughter 
so urge by your hand and so imminent 
into a idle fancy but devise 
how to prevent it watch when he shall rise 
and with a sudden outcry of his murder 
blow his retreat before he be engage 

o father have my dumb woe wake your death 
when will our humane grief be at their height 
man be a tree that have no top in care 
no root in comfort all his power to live 
be give to no end but to have power to grieve 

it be the just curse of our abuse creation 
which we must suffer here and escape hereafter 
he have the great mind that submit to all 
he see inevitable he the small 
that carp at earth and her foundation shaker 
and rather than himself will mend his maker 

away my love away thou will be murder 

murder I know not what that hebrew mean 
that word have never be name have all be D'Ambois 
murder by heaven he be my murderer 
that show i not a murderer what such bug

his fight in the face upon who hand sit death 
who sword have wing and every feather pierce 
let in my politic visitant let they in

and I at all part buckle in my fate

a mistress and a servant let my death 
define life nothing but a courtier breath 
Nothing be make of nought of all thing make

I will not complain to earth yet but to heaven 
and like a man look upward even in death 
prop i true sword as thou have ever do

till death have make i marble o my fame

and haste thou where the greyeyed morn perfines 
her rosy chariot with sabaean spice 
fly where the evening from the Iberian vale 
take on her swarthy shoulder Hecate 
crown with a grove of oak fly where man feel 
the burn axletree and those that suffer 
beneath the chariot of the snowy bear 
and tell they all that D'Ambois now be haste 
to the eternal dweller that a thunder 
of all their sigh together for their frailty 
behold in i may quit my worthless fall 
with a fit volley for my funeral 

forgive thy murderer 

I forgive they all 
and you my lord their fautor for true sign 
of which unfeigned remission take my sword 
take it and only give it motion 
and it shall find the way to victory 
by his own brightness and the inherent valour 
my fight have still into it with charm of spirit 

and let i pray you that my weighty blood 
lay in one scale of your impartial spleen 
may sway the forfeit of my worthy love 
weigh in the other and be reconcile 
with all forgiveness to your matchless wife 

forgive thou i dear servant and this hand 
that lead thy life to this unworthy end 
forgive it for the blood with which it be stain 
in which I write the summons of thy death 
the force summons by this bleed wound 
by this here in my bosom and by this 
that make i hold up both my hand imbrue 
for thy dear pardon 

o my heart be break 
fate nor these murderer monsieur nor the Guise 
have any glory in my death but this 
this kill spectacle this prodigy 
my sun be turn to blood against who red beam 
Pindus and Ossa hide in endless snow 
lay on my heart and liver from their vein 
melt like two hungry torrent eat rock 
into the ocean of all humane life 
and make it bitter only with my blood 
oh frail condition of strength valour virtue 
in I like warn fire upon the top 
of some steep beacon on a steep hill 
make to express it like a fall star 
silent glance that like a thunderbolt 
look to have stick and shake the firmament 

son of the earth who my unrested soul 
rue to have beget in the faith of heaven 
since thy revengeful spirit have reject 
the charity it command and the remission 
to serve and worship the blind rage of blood 
assay to gratulate and pacify 
the soul flee from this worthy by perform 
the christian reconcilement he beseech 
betwixt thou and thy lady let her wound 
manlesly dig in she be ease and cure 
with balm of thy own tear or be assure 
never to rest free from my haunt and horror 

see how she merit this still sit by 
and mourn his fall more than her own fault 

remove dear daughter and content thy husband 
so piety will thou and thy servant peace 

o wretched piety that be so distract 
in thy own constancy and in thy right 
must be unrighteous if I right my friend 
I wrong my husband if his wrong I shun 
the duty of my friend I leave undo 
ill play on both side here and there it rise 
no place no good so good but ill comprise 
my soul more scruple breed than my blood sin 
virtue impose more than any stepdame 
oh have I never marry but for form 
never vow faith but purpose to deceive 
never make conscience of any sin 
but cloak it private and make it common 
nor never honour be in blood or mind 
happy have I be then as other be

I do forgive thou and upon my knee 
with hand hold up to heaven wish that my honour 
will suffer reconcilement to my love 
but since it will not honour never serve 
my love with flourish object till it starve 
and as this taper though it upward look 
downward must needs consume so let our love 
as have lose his honey the sweet taste 
run into savour and will needs retain 
a spice of his first parent till like life 
it see and die so let our love and last 
as when the flame be suffer to look up 
it keep his luster but be thus turn down 
his natural course of useful light invert 
his own stuff put it out so let our love 
now turn from i as here I turn from thou 
and may both point of heaven straight axletree 
conjoin in one before thyself and i 

my terror be strike inward and no more 
my penance will allow they shall enforce 
earthly affliction but upon myself 
farewell brave relic of a complete man 
look up and see thy spirit make a star 
join flame with Hercules and when thou set 
thy radiant forehead in the firmament 
make the vast continent crack with thy receipt 
spread to a world of fire and the age sky 
cheer with new spark of old humanity
