I must not be so rude as to believe 
that you my lord can your affection set 
upon a maid so humble in her birth 
as she you name for regard of honour 
do not mock the sister of your servant 

this way to madness lead teach not my heart 
such modern heraldry let it dispose 
of charitable thought with natural eye 
unlimited by customary form 
which gain and nicety have make a art 
virtue not blood ennoble we and earn 
her attribute without hereditary help 
from ancestor o my dear Foreste 
thy sister with such noble wealth be fraught 
that to be covetous for she appear 
a holy sin but thou be cruel grow 
thy memory be sick the old effect 
that witness how I love thy learned soul 
be quite forget 

young lord disclaim that thought 
hear I promulgate you my patron be 
you find i in estate so poor so low 
that you be fain to stoop to lift i up 
you be the duke creature who dote by art 
who in his love and kindness method keep 
he hold thus his arm in fearful care 
not to bruise you with his dear embracement 
and what be she who virgin blood disdain 
to quench your lawful fire or who the duke 
will not procure to climb your marriage be 
upon her knee and shall I then 
like to the treacherous moon strive to eclipse 
the sun that give i light shall I consent 
that she that tumble in a womb with i 
shall give your issue birth the royal duke 
will thank i for such charity my lord 
though you be wise you be but young 

heart of viper

mark how slow he go shall I never be old 
that my design may repute have 
and credit in the world I do not ask 
thy sister for my whore but for my wife

for I will eat your heart shall it contrive 
a way in thought how to cheat my sister 
of her pure chastity I love you so 
that I with care suppose she not deserve 
to be your wife and so esteem of she 
that she be much too good to be your whore 
in this new argument I be too bold

this courtship be not safe you must not meet 
your lover with a rival glorious 
as yourself Foreste welcome from Genoa 
how fare our brother cardinal 

in health and ease he bid i tell your grace 
it be a deed of charity to think 
he worthy of this same great employment 
and this letter he humble recommend 
to your perusal 

how can it choose 
but choke the very soul and bruise the heart 
to think that such a giddy snipe a fool 
that mere live to disparage nature 
shall creep to this ambitious government 
still he rule the ruler the duke be ward 
unto a page who kickshaw wear more beard 
then do his chin and there be his instrument 
a dark fellow that with disguise look 
can cheat a hypocrite old than time 

I have hear a better character of both 
such as to the young count wit and valour give 
unto Foreste honest spirit 

report be then become a bawd to luck 
who fortune do enrich fame do flatter 

sure this tame priest will make we all coward 
we must a truce confirm with Genoa 
well be it so where now my noble boy 
shall I occasion find to testify 
that you deserve my love by virtue of your own 
in sickly time when war and civil spleen 
besiege the heart with treacherous design 
a friend shall find a cause to make he know 
but now in fair weather I need not ask 
what hovel be near 

in this I dare discredit fate 
they be not so wealthy in affliction 
with sorrow so well store as can suffice 
to try my sufferance in the behalf 
of you my prince and still royal master 

dare thou then die for i 
here make thyself a sacrifice to fame 
take it and I will be thy chronicler 

it be sir but ingratitude in i 
to lessen thus the number sanctify 
of your true friend be you please to sheathe it 
in that same part which you do most abhor 

o Lucio thou be my earwig now 
creep in my ear to feast upon my brain 
when in my private grave I lie enclose 
more silent than my ruine fame no tongue 
shall pay his tribute to my memory 
but thou for thou be likely to survive 
thy year be few but full of gratitude 
come hie we to the park the sprightful morn 
give motion wing and liberty to those 
who lameness stake unto the ground 

royal dotard like tinder thou do waste 
thy force fire to give another light 
who saucy flame will darken thou monstrous 

why do thou spend thy gall in secret thus 
a pox upon it turn thought to action 
heaven know I have rather enrich myself 
then envy other wealth employ thy brain

the dear benefit of the practic part 
custom be a suitor safe encourager 
i the duke have serve since I be able 
to serve myself yet never have the luck 
to get by it and as the time promise 
never shall unless I imitate the crab 
and find my way as he do his backward 
that be to make petition to the foot 
that he will please to instruct and teach the head 
when to commiserate my affair 

signior I need a comment to your word 

if you will move my lord the count 
to get the duke fair hand subscribe here 
then shall I feel myself well understand 

sir my ability be most pregnant 
when I find I may be profitable 
to any courtier just and modest suit 
I pray what sense carry the inscription 

only this sir there be a engine make 
which spend its strength by force of nimble wheel 
for they once screw up in their return 
will rive on oak but with such subtle force 
that motion give no leisure to impediment 
the large and ponderous log be soon consume 
to shave more transparent than a glass 
of these the skillful box make scabbard 
sheath chest and mould for child cabinet 

trust i a engine of importance great 
but now what will the engineer himself 

faith signior nought but a monopoly 
for all those ware his engine make 

keep it good sir keep it a monopoly 
why sir the commonwealth have be so crush 
with the insult charter of such parent 
that now the very word defile the cause 
I have think you signior will have engage 
my industry in such a suit as may 
noway disparage though it do enrich 
however not abuse the public weal 

very good sir my lord the count yourself 
his servile instrument and some other 
of this new faction that now engross 
all office and send your scout abroad 
intelligencer strict that bring you home 
the number and the rate of what yourselves 
or other in the dark can put to sale 
nature have not alter yet the first 
and antic method to preserve our breath 
we must eat bread if we intend to live 
which how to get unless this humble way 
that you deride in troth I can tell 
it make i mad to think you shall expose 
we man of heart to those fastidious help 
that escape your own acceptance your wide threat 
that soon will swallow any thing which fill 
although it nourish not a pox upon you all 

I do expect you will begin to rail 
good trouble soul I know you well before 
you be the only man who wealthy muse 
do furnish all the fiddler in the state 
with desperate ballad and invective song 
libel of such weak fancy and composure 
that we do all esteem it great wrong 
to have our name extant in such paltry rhyme 
then in the slanderous sense 

very well sir 

you you must be a satirist forsooth 
calumniate by instinct and inspiration 
as if just heaven will borrow gall of you 
wherewith to write our fault oh strict account 
your gall which in the pen so overflow 
that still it blot where in inscribe 
you imitate the property of dog 
who bark and snarl most at he they know not 
for else among all those you scandalize 
why name you i almost a stranger to your eye 
my ancestor that build no monument 
for their fame to dwell in you also bring 
into the knowledge of the critic world 
why I can never see thou yet but drunk 
which make thy verse reel and stagger so 

Come sir we may exchange one thrust unseen 
they draw fight close for sting down case and disarm he 

a pretty cur dare it bite as well as bark 
how now sir your mathematical thrust 
then have at you yield i thy sword or else thou die 
I have no joy to set at liberty 
a soul so unprepared and as thou be 
my enemy I take a full revenge 
by suffer thy corrupt blood to dwell 
and taint within thy vein we be discover 
take thy sword now get thou home and rail upon it 
because it will fight no better 

yet we may meet in the dark you have a throat 
and there be knife in Italy 

a good day attend my ghostly father 
do this your tarriance here discover aught 
you will with i 

your leisure shall produce my utterance 
o son your fame be of complexion clear 
such as ensnare the virtuous eye to love 
and adoration such as will procure 
all the skilful angel suitor to she 
and such as serve for my encouragement 
for I no letter have from noble friend 
which a requital from themselves invite 
by courtship bold and troublesome to other 
nor be I with that wicked mettle store 
that rule the mighty and betray the mind 
to toil in a design which anger heaven 
and make the devil blush but yet dear son 
I have a suit to thou 

which I desire to know 

in the ancient covent of S Austin 
there be a holy brother late dead 
who place if you will but confirm on i 
by the duke letter to the brotherhood 
then shall I better leisure have to pray 
for you my patron 

alas my father 
the time be more observant to your tribe 
it be the method now that your desert 
need not to usher but succeed reward 
the treatise write late to confute 
the desperate sect in Mantua call it you 
the author 

it know no other 

there your preferment safe take root 
believe i ghostly father I will choose 
the fit time to work in your behalf 

heaven prosper your design 

what throng of great impediment besiege 
the virtuous mind so thick in multitude 
they jostle one another as they come 
have vice a charter get that none must rise 
but such who of the devil faction be 
the way to honour be not evermore 
the way to hell a virtuous man may climb 
let the flatterer sell his lie else where 
it be unthrifty merchandise to change 
my gold for breath of all antagonist 
most charity I find in envious man 
for they do soon hurt themselves then hurt 
or i or he that raise i up 
a envious man be make of thought 
to ruminate much do melt the brain 
and make the heart grow lean such man as these 
that in oppose waste their proper strength 
that sacrifice themselves in silly hope 
to butcher we save revenge a labour 
and die to make experiment of wrath 
let fame discourse aloud until she want 
a antidote I be not scare with noise 
here I dismiss my fear if I can swell 
unpoisoned by those help which heaven forbid 
fond love of ease shall never my soul dehort 
maugre all flattery envy or report 

death encounter they Lucio shut the door 
it be the plague of greatness the curse 
of pomp that in our dark privacy we must 
even public be to every man affair 
how now all these saucy troop of brawl 
suitor attend on you my glorious boy 

it be their humble skill not to arrive 
before your grace but by a advocate 
a mediator bless in your eye 

how apt be I to love yet now observe 
unkindness in my care and bitterness 
in physic I study how to make thou less 
that I may make thou more and more my own 
office and dignity be enemy 
to health and ease respect grow tedious 
observance troublesome where it be most due 
he that give his soul no more employment 
than what be her own may sleep within a drum 
while busy heart that love to undertake 
beyond their reach of year be fain to use 
drowsy potion yet watch the winter night 
with more distinction than the parish clock 
can thou resign thy title and thy care 
to make i yet more capable of still 
enjoy thou 

my zeal unto myself forbid my speech 
since if I make reply to this I but 
disparage duty and consume my breath 
where sight be young and clear there spectacle 
be troublesome and rather hide then show 
the object the most devout obedience 
which I shall ever owe unto your grace 
become my heart much better than my tongue 

but yet observe my Lucio 
the unkind trick of nature how we be fool 
by a religious constancy in love 
a prince hate do ruin where it fall 
but his affection warm where it shine 
until it kindle fire to scorch himself 
if we be subject to the sin of heaven 
too much charity extremity of love 
let there be mercy show in punishment 
why be the corrupt use of royal love 
impute to our charge to our audit lay 
we that with all those organ furnish be 
all those faculty natural in man 
yet limit in use of each prescribe 
our conversation by a saucy form 
of state how can we choose by this restraint 
but struggle more for liberty make choice 
of some one ear wherein to empty out our soul 
when they be full of busy thought of plot 
abortive crude and thin it be cheap and base 
for majesty not to be singular 
in all effect o then if I must give my heart 
to the command of one send he sweet heaven 
a modest appetite teach he to know 
the stomach soon surfeit with too much 
then starve for lack of that supply 
which covetous ambition call want 
for when my friend beg my bounty then 
conclude to make i poor before that he 
shall so unthrifty be of breath to ask in vain 
distraction tameness o my Lucio 
how can thou construe this after I have chide 
I seem to flatter thou 

my gracious lord 

peace 
I will no more employ my memory 
thus to discourage thou where be Foreste 
it be fit he know you be not vigilant 
in his behalf Farelo de Sforza 
my old secretary be new dead 
the place be he I shall expect no thanks 
from you nor yet from he 
my bounty be requite in her choice 

your grace will bring we both within the reach 
of public envy 

thou now will certify 
his birth obscure and base discourage 
such earnest help to his so great promotion 
not a jot know my boy it be the vulgar 
not the royal trade to patch up thing 
or seek to mend what be before of quality 
perfect enough itself to make a man 
of nothing why this same creation 
incline a little near divinity 
near the old performance which from chaos 
draw this multitude of subtle form 

since you the royal maker do commend 
the mettle and your workmanship it show 
there be little skill in those which envy he 
Foreste be your creature many time 
I do acquaint he what the general voice 
do urge in his disgrace he laugh it out 
and swear he will not lose that privilege 
which nature give he by her kind mistake 
in his nativity for the sea worth 
as if from we issue he can never deserve 
a monument unless himself do hew 
the stone whereof it be build unless he raise 
his monument on a wart his dignity 
on poverty obscure and base 

we do affect his thought such industry 
proclaim he fit for high design some man 
attend the talk drum and riddle out 
their life on earth with madness sophistry 
call their loss their gain danger delight 
some man converse with book and melt the brain 
in sullen study how to vindicate 
the liberal art those lose formality 
then grow methodical and die in the dark 
some practice rule of state and suffer much 
for honour sake nay tread upon themselves 
at first to reach the high some pursue 
the plough and in their wholesome sweat do swim 
and some that furnish be with nimble soul 
employ their time in wanton exercise 
masque and revel the compliment of love 
and love I find the easy vanity 

o gentle Corsa make it so with i 
fain will I if I dare reveal to he 
the heat of my affection and where it be fix 

hark sure the gallery door be leave unlock 
be we debar all place of privacy 
nature in we have lose her vulgar right 
a loud bawl suitor do not waken 
charity but deafen she 
a shame upon they all in Lucio 

do here Cosimo 

what say thou 

I prithee stay why slip but here aside 
and thou shall see the most resplendent fop 
that ever do discredit nature signior 
Lothario a country gentleman 
but now the court baboon who persuade himself 
out of a new kind of madness to be 
the duke favourite he come the other be 
a bundle of proverb who he seduce 
from the plough to serve he for preferment 

Borachio 

my lord 

survey my garment round and then declare if I have hit it 

you have sir but not the mark 

what mark thou bold parishioner of hell 

why sir the mark I aim at preferment 
after a storm come a calm the hard 
you blow the soon your cheek will ache and he 
that care for your anger may have more of it 
when he list for my part I know my mother 

the froward sister have conspire slave dog 
will thou never leave this immense folly 
can nothing serve these dull lip but proverb 

sir I know none of your proverb first come 
first serve these word that be near the tongue 
have opportunity soon to leave 
the mouth 

be it then decree I must grow mad 

I will be no more flout nor bruise not I 
what need my lord be behold to i 
for his mirth when he may laugh at we own folly 
beside though motion and exercise 
be good for gross body therefore must they 
of the guard pitch i up and down like a bar 

sa sa sa a mutiny in heaven 

if there be you be not likely to come 
thither to appease it first end this quarrel 
upon earth I have serve you this six month 
in hope of a office and be no more 
a officer than she that bear i 

alas poor fool 
I pity thou thou will believe nothing 
but that which may be see or understand 
I say thou be a officer or if thou be not 
thou shall be which be better for that same 
which we now enjoy be in some danger 
to be lose but that which we never have 
can be lose before we have it 

o rare conclusion 

beside look here and then rejoice be the count 
who they call my rival in the duke favour 
be he I say accoutre like to i 
why his sleeve sit like stocking on his arm 
his breeches be like two cloakbag half sow 
together in the twist and his other 
garment show like plaster on he follow 
and make thy fortune fat 

well he that still expect but tire his hope 
what one can another can it be so 
with day and hour too and for my part 
let the glass run out 

his man be as full of proverb 
as a constable he coin they himself 

and such another headpiece fill with whey 
as be the master here the sun never see 

he walk like a Zealandstork 

but sure the duke 
enable error in their fancy by some 
behaviour equivalent to what 
the master and the man expect for else 
folly can be so sickeyed but time 
will give it strength to know itself 

why sir this dignify the jest they scarce 
ere see the duke and be less know 
unto the world his grace well apprehend 
these voluntary mistake of nature 
in preservation of their intellect 
be fit subject for accidental mirth 
than a comical continuance it be 
a levity too humble in a prince 
to heed such trifle 

nay prithee lead the way 

I can tell why thou my girl shall joy 
in my advancement thus honour and place 
bring sullen thought with they business of such 
a ragged quality as take away 
the amorous garb those soft wanton touch 
wherewith the youthful flatterer betray 
the weak side to action who effect 
more weakness bring I shall no leisure have 
to comfort thou with smile when it be assign 
that I must venture for a boy it will be 
in haste my business will not suffer i 
to stay and make a prologue to the act 
to kiss or simper invitation 

it be not fit I apprehend you now 
but I wish that you will know my duty 
be so well preserve from all corruption 
which either youth or foul example may 
produce that it implore for sufferance 
to certify the world how strong it be 

I be assure before this be the time 
in which I shall oblige posterity 
or fall my wench by flatter error 
have thou to my sister counsel give 
instruction safe whereby her action 
may warrant her promotion well deserve 

it be my tongue last employment 

I will have she wear her grow fortune 
in a handsome fashion do but observe 
the unpolished garb of city dame of those 
who father pursestring hoist up to honour 
how they do suck their chin into their neck 
simper with unskilful levity and trip 
on their wanton toe like kibeheeledfairy 
the devil dam show like a vestal nun 
to they more powerful in humility 
instruct my sister gentle wife 

I shall be earnest to my utmost skill 

my lord be come where be my sister 

with the Florentine who instruct she in music 

signior Foreste 
you see my love be rude and bold I be 
the usher to my own entrance 

my good lord the proverb will persuade you 
to be bold with what be your own 
your title be strong both to the house and i 

I be in debt for both will thou not child 
to see my heart assume this liberty 
upon my tongue before it right know 
thy sister heart 
the duke consent as yet unasked too heark 

cease that noise it be troublesome 

how forest have thou ear and will thou 
•ence such hopeful harmony or be 
thy thirst unnatural will thou forbid 
thy friend to share in what be good sweet tongue 
and hand persist in what your kindness proffer 

obey he if the music not deserve 
your strict attention you must blame yourself 

show i the way Foreste 

whither sir 

my heart be steal out of my ear let i 
but know the thief and I will forgive the robbery 
speak who be it that with a voice so amorous 
and shrill confound the other hollow organ 
still so reserve and unto i 

why then look there the voice be she go sir 
and take what else you will enforce from my possession 

be this that child of Orpheus how kneel to i 

stay sir if she consent but to abuse 
the property of motion in such kind 
as may exalt her person but on such 
above this height I be her enemy 
for evermore Consider what you do 
she bring no portion but humility 
if her first payment fail who dare assure 
the future debt pray look into her lap 
you will find she come not from the east enrich 
with diamond bright wealth who wanton worth 
unskilful fancy prize not from use 
but from the idolatrous dote of the eye 
her chaste obedience be all her dowry 
o bitter speech it cut my very soul 
to think that fortune shall create we two 
mere pattern of your charity 

dare you authorise this idolatry 
then I will kneel too 

and I 
will join to make the offence seem virtuous 
now interchange your soul where passion be 
so fond it can well be counterfeit 
each unbusied angel hear i speak 
o send send down unto this youthful pair 
celestial heat such serious love as make 
a business of delight instruct her soul 
to practise duty in the humble strain 
and furnish he with a acceptance prompt 
make her fruitful as the vine which grow 
crooked with the weight of its own increase 
So bless in their issue that when time 
shall think they fit to taste the privilege 
of death they shall not need a monument 
yet dwell as chief in the memory of fame 

amen amen 

such be my prayer too o Foreste 
excessive joy disturb my utterance 
my word be part on any tongue o speak 
thou know my heart tell she there may lie hope 
I shall deserve those tear that show like dew 
upon the morning cheek entreat she that 
my year may not disgrace my love though I 
be young I can counterfeit 
I ever speak my thought I be overcome 

Alas sir so be I there need no art 
to help belief where no suspicion be 

now I will leave you to yourselves 

I have much to promise in my own behalf 
of my future love and humble duty 
to you my dear lord time lay his hand 
on pyramid of brass and ruin quite 
what all the fond artificer do think 
immortal workmanship he send his worm 
to book to old record and they devour 
the inscription he love ingratitude 
for he destroy the memory of man 
but I shall never forget on what strange term 
you take i to your bed 

excellent wretch I be undo with joy 
I will not blame the coward to fear death 
since the world contain such joy as this 
why do you weep lady can you suppose 
Foreste will consent to what be do 
unless he know there be no danger in it 
sure his mother be a sibyl he see 
with a prophetic aim the end of his 
design before they come to action 
he be too wise to err why weep you then 

it be a folly in my eye 
I know not why they weep unless they weep 
because they now have lose their liberty 
heretofore each man which chance present 
be to they a lawful object but now 
they be to look on none but you 

mark then the bondage I impose on i 
my poor eye have no object but your face 
of which I will deprive they thus 
shroud thou in thy vestal ornament 
creep creep my glorious sun behind a cloud 
for else my eye will surfeit with delight 
I never feel true joy till now methinks 
a brisk alacrity a nimble fire 
convey i strange from my flesh 
not the cannon ironentrail when wrap 
within a swarthy case of trouble air 
can equall i in emphasis of motion 

though modesty will suffer i to boast 
yet it be not in the power of breath to make 
my joy so know as it be feel 

Come then my dear Corsa the priest attend 
within the world want man and Hymen be 
a nimble God when all be past prevention 
the duke shall know my choice 

this disgrace make thy cousin boil his heart 
in his own blood 

he have write a most pestilent libel 
which must be sing all about the city 
by one he call his daw a tall big fellow 

I know he he sing like Phalaris bull 

I suppose at first he will have send he 
a challenge 

but that be contingent now Foreste 
be make secretary of state 

I have hear of the new edict which institute 
a mysterious toy in the hatband for those 
of the faction 

why about two day since one of the sect 
send i a challenge because my sister 
drink his lord health with her coif on each hour 
these giddy participle do embark 
themselves for duel the one be a kin 
to my honourable lady the other 
to my very good lord 

there come my cousin chaw his lean heart 

good morrow to the court satirist 

the world be alter Dorido Foreste 
be step beyond my reach we can meet 
in duel the herald stand between 
but my fine thrush can sing you a new libel 

we shall have your thrush in a cage short 
Remember who you deal withal 

hang he dull open slave his thought may be 
discern through the shave of a deal board 
I will sift and winnow he in a old hat 

prithee sweet Castruchio leave thy barking 
it will bet treason short for any man 
to carry ear within three mile of thy tongue 

why signior what faction be you of 

not of your faction sir if none return 
unto the prison for your libel 
you remember your vice strip and whip 
your trim eclogue the fulsome satyr too 
write to his grace wherein you flatter 
whine and damn yourself to get a pardon 
for what seem there a resolute offence 
satyr be more useful now then ever 
nor grieve it i to see the humour use 
but thus abuse to see a bard still reach 
at holy bay passion of i I will tell thou 
thy rhyme include not so much brain as will 
suffice to fill a cherrystone 

you will fain make i angry 

ay with thyself 

and than thou spend thy gall with more justice 
then when thou rail against Foreste 

cry you mercy precious Cox have Foreste 
so great a share in your tongue too sympathy 
be corrupt behold society 
among the wicked while a virtuous man 
be leave alone to resist his bad fate 
let he chide the fulsome age rail against 
the time aloud though in a vault or between 
two hill he shall find no zealous echo 
to second his bold language when I die 
I die a martyr to the commonweal 

dull caitiff leave these abortive provect 
and talk in the new fashion I will have 
my very dug bark in the courtly garb 

step aside they be as mad as thy cousin 

the excrement and mere defect of nature 
shall be reduce to ornament in i 
I will feed upon the tongue of nightingale 
for so each fart I let will be a song 

for the peripatetic be butcher 
here in Sienna 

a Pallas hew in a entire carbuncle 
encircle with a more that flow with Lhasis 

derive their augury from the warm entrail 
of a calf 

sir these be some of those that laugh at you 
in the presence 

at i thou lie they laugh at thou 

why then the devil will never give a man

Foreste 

my gracious lord 

be yet our letter to his holiness 
dispatch 

they be so please your grace 

do the Frenchambassador make some show 
of discontent at his departure hence 

both in his word and look for when he hear 
the EnglishLeiger have oppose his treaty 
concern traffic with the florentine 
his anger straight dismiss the argument 
and seize upon the nation nay rail 
against the leaguer too who opposition 
may be chide as too nice a virtue 
but can not be accuse as a vice 
it be know indeed the french do take a pride 
in the emphasis of sudden anger 
as if alacrity in ill do make 
the fault look handsome and dulness add 
deformity to sin 

it be faithful observe 

swell with uncharitable pride such as 
admit no style of neighbour as if grow 
above the use of friendship they seem to call 
those mighty islander near their soil 
poor borderer to their continent such 
who thin number have in bloody battle 
make their multitude their impediment 
wear their ensign instead of gaudy scarf 

the chance of war 
admit many time of miracle 
even such as do discredit history 
highprovidence confer the conquest there 
where probability confer the loss 
and this be do that we may attribute 
the praise to he that give the victory 
not to they that get it observe beside 
that when the weak do overcome the strong 
do leave that stain for their posterity 
to wipe away which be already do 
the french have fiery nimble spirit 

your grace deal just in your praise they have 
spirit but they all be useless make 
by forward and affectate violence 
he that spend his fury and his strength 
in the first charge must not hope to make his retreat 
so noble as the modest combatant 
who onset slow move as careful not 
to outride his skill their valour be to attempt 
not to perform it be a giddy nation 
and never serious but in trifle 

thou do mistake in natural effect 
where fancy be so rich the incident 
to some misexpense these witty riot 
divulge the wealth of the brain fruit that be ripe 
be prone to fall or to corrupt it self 
accord to the age of monarchy 
they now be full ripe they reach 
the height and top of mortal faculty 
nature in they do stand upon the verge 
of her own youth the english want 
three hundred year of that perfection 
and as the moon never change but in the full 
even so the mighty nation of the earth 
change in their great glory First their strict 
and rugged discipline to vain delight 
their solemn march next to wanton jig 
their battle fierce to duel splenative 
or witty quarrel of the pen 

here may my knee take root while I do grow 
a live statue of true obedience 
or let my royal master grant his pardon 

sure we may trust the judgement of our eye 
thou do not look as if thou can commit 
a sin so horrid so ugly as can fright 
our mercy from we rise we pardon thou 
now let we know thy crime 

it be no crime 
unless against that great prerogative 
your ear have overrun perhaps my heart 
have make escape through these fond eye and I 
in the rash discretion of my youthful blood 
confine myself in matrimonial bond

more delightful than any nature make 
have thou Lucio so much unhappy wit 
as to be jealous yet with thou suppose 
thyself secure in our discourse

your time so ill as to discourse with she 
till grow jealous 

Come hither lady come confess how chance 
you have bewitch my boy with subtle smile 
with wanton behaviour of those pretty eye

to be abuse in the use and now

and havoc of his beauty hah speak lady 

I hope your grace have thought more merciful 
I know this match be make in heaven and not 
provoke by any sinful art in i 
how I have use he in this little time 
that he have be my lord let he declare 
my duty be so strict I need not blush 
to hear the story tell 

no look look there his eye for very shame 
their lustre be lost be creep into his head 
encircle with the weak colour blue 
the rose in his cheek be wither quite 
his clear and brisk aspect be muddy now 
and dull his voice that be so shrill and can 
even trumpetlike outscold the echo 
be hollow grow and hoarse have you then use he well 

Alas most gracious sir go not about 
to make my lord suspect my loyalty 
if nature sickne in his faculty 
which heaven be thank I perceive not yet 
it can prove a guiltiness in i 

believe it young wife I be no proselyte 
I still aver you be that greedy nymph 
that have devour the rich complexion of my boy 
see how his feature be shrink his beauty stain 
the scythian dame who cruelty be such 
who lust so prodigal that she do strive 
to kill the able lecher in the act 
make her womb his sepulchre will yet 
have spare that wanton handsomeness to show 
as pattern of her lenity 

I hope your grace will pardon ignorance 
that so ill manner be as not to know 
your meaning 

no matter lady 
my accusation shall withdraw itself 
pretty innocence Lucio prepare 
it be our will to make thy wife a courtier 
she shall be high in favour if she will leave 
her modesty that be out of fashion now 
in neighbour court the lady so prevail 
with masculine behaviour they grow 
in faction able to depose their husband 
from the charter of their sex 

it be strange that his dislike be flee so soon 

your marriage we will solemnize with mask 
and revel if invention ever mean 
to get reward for subtlety it be now 
we take notice Lucio she be thy wife 
and thy sister our Foreste 

we your grace humble creature 

affection be become a parasite 
strive to please who it can benefit 

know by who by city wit 

or my lady workman 

who never see verse but what their suitor write 
which they read like prose too 

I will not discredit my patience talk on 

they say you be particular with a 
great lady 

yes and her pensioner 

some loose thing belike yet will be at charge 
to secure her fame from noise for thou pray 
against all lechery but thy own 

and she have wish in wittypenitence 
thou have be single in the world 

ay for then she have live chaste he grow angry 
his eye look red 

no sir they blush to see a fool 

it be fit they will employ their modesty 
at home for thou be a fool in print 

yet have he live when the old sibyl 
present her divine manuscript to 
the dull roman he will have scold with she 
unless his pamphlet have attain the first 
acceptance 

true for every poet think himself 
the best poet in the world 

and that satyr not the worst wherein 
he chide woman for wear their halfruffe 
which pin behind trans situate the face 
or make they look like janus with two face 

a just exception for go hasty 
to kiss his whore he can not find her mouth 

why sure her breath be strong enough 
to direct he to it 

yet I have hear nothing but what deserve 
more pity than anger 

now when he have provide some high toy 
for the press he think on dedication 
straight choose one of the faction who must 
not patronize but buy what he make vendable 
with praise in the epistle 

can you deny this cousin satirist 

and nothing make learning so cheap but that 
every writer sell his work 

nay let we follow and worry he to piece 

our ruin be contrive above 
if our master prove unkind the planet 
govern ill for our gratitude and care 
deserve more constancy 

look he so strange on you 

as if the object be but new to he 
and his own heart unsettle in his breast 

be his violence so soon tire survey 
the register of your own deed speak sir 
have you so engross his ear as if their 
organ be you not his confine they to 
your own tongue and so deprive the sorrowful 
the grieve in heart of a easy audience 

never 

since you have share the duke prerogative 
and by his love hold opposition 
at such great advantage do you ever slight 
with cheap regard those of high and noble birth 

my soul abhor such tyranny 

have those who be the eternal livery 
buy their wage of you or have they find 
bold and skilful flattery more help 
advancement then deep and modest learning 

never since my distinction be of power 
to help its choice 

in nice trial or evidence of law 
have custom which only give we hope 
of certainty in justice be traduce 
by your obscure help 

never 

have the desolate widow scare mercy 
from your eye with her old ruine beauty 
for grief be never amorous or have 
the tear beggar too soon dismiss your charity 
because not giddy enough to delight 
wantonness 

never 

then if our great master withdraw his love 
the weight of sufferance can bruise you 
for the whole world will share in the burden 

from who be this sir 

from my lord marquis de Loretta 

I humble kiss his hand 

now luck flatter i but once and I be make 
it be short pray heaven it be sweet or I will never love 
the proverb 

sir have you ever be in service 
under any eminent commander 

never yet 

read these Foreste 
how reputation lessen in esteem 
courtesy grow so cheap that denial 
seem less troublesome than consent 
and performance be only lazy 
the labour of subscription hinder more 
then think of that to which it do subscribe 
this letter will fain make you a captain 
in the new troop send to the valtaline 
but sure your modesty will teach you balk 
the grant though I shall beg you to receive it 

sir shall the grey head the old soldier 
that try misfortune by his constancy 
in sufferance affront the winter rage 
while his blood be freeze into coral 
his sin into wire whole valour think 
to wear chain shot as bracelet on his loin 
shall his preferment be intercept 
shall he now trail a pike under a boy 
who experience be young than his face 

no the friendship of the noble marquis 
shall never countenance unjust deed 
find a suit more capable of my grant 
and your acceptance it be your own 

noble signior I will put you to the test 

prince letter be cheap far than those 
which scrivener put to sale if such pigmy 
ape in doublet procure command of the camp 
let the crane wage war again no opposition 
be too weak to ruinate go young lord 
the duke be ill accompany if only 
with his own thought discover more perhaps 
his discontent concern not you

and gather in the breast like ball of snow 
in snow until the weight make it deny 
to be remove then melt at leisure too

be satisfy thus 

why then consider thus you go to Lucca 
there to congratulate the sit approach 
of the pope legate he have be there a week 
and why he be not visit ere this 
or why upon such strict and short summons 
yourself must now be send quite puzzle i 
action rare and sudden do common 
proceed from fierce necessity or else 
from some oblique design which be ashamed 
to show itself in the public road 

Foreste be this all 

why i sweet patron this be enough 
of danger since none be merit 

young thought encourage i to sufferance 
each storm be usher to a gentle calm 
why toil with speed get soon home to rest 
the plod mule shall sleep eternal 
why shall the strike deer bemoan his death 
his obsequy be full of noble rite 
Actaeon choir a jolly requiem give 
and the arrow from the bow do sing his dirge 

thus thy year do riddle grief away 
make sorrow swift because it be mortal 
let i wait on your lordship to your horse 
and at your better leisure read this same 
I will tell you as we go who bring it i 

to wrong my boy unkind incestuous heat 
why be copulation legal it give 
authority to lust for chastity 
will soon conclude the world o virtuous 
prejudice when error prevent folly 
fiend devil that do live in liquid fire 
have constitution not half so hot 
so riotous as i but why this 
the beauteous Corsa be not yet defile 
he that repent ere he commit a fault 
do like a thirsty sinner store his soul 
with mercy to absolve that sin himself 
which he may afterward more secure 
fall into enough this soon initiate 
the credulous count her husband I have send 
to Lucca and tomorrow he return 
my plot be limit too short a time 
to become action nor be it skill 
to send the jewel by her sister mark 
my soul and brain be perfect courtier grow 
in my declension and my great want 
they leave i to instruct and help myself 

these fancy be not old the whole court 
observe he strange alter but why 
be I send for that I must know by safe 
and cautelous insinuation 

how soon I have profit in discipline 
of hell I must through what I do mean 
adultery at first will now I fear 
become a rape 

hah still upon that string I like it well 
it be musical 

Castruchio be thou come 
thou have be a courtier long but whether 
it be want of skill in i to choose a man 
or want of luck in thou to be my choice 
suspense make neutral but know my love 
be tardy because still void of leisure 
to warrant passion well bestow by safe 
though tedious trial affection 
that be slow be sure and now I wear my heart 
not in mine own breast but thou 

I have but one life it be some error 
in your grace thus to oblige i to the loss 
of more in your dear service 

I be not skill in word but I affect 
thy fury for thou be the bold satyr 
that whip Foreste and the wanton count 
in thy tart verse 

my gracious lord I shall conceive much grief 
if my zeal mistake in accusation 
of those man which the uncertain tongue of fame 
deliver to my charge 

nay make not thy confession a excuse 
rather than a story for there need none 
I hate Foreste and the count and will 
devise succinct way to my revenge 

heaven forbid I will rather far disgrace 
the skill of my subject call accusation 
slander then that the busy multitude 
shall note inconstancy in you 

this be a damn hypocrite chameleon 
change be not so intricate to sense 
Castruchio ease i with nimble apprehension 
I have not leisure to be modest now 
speak haste no acquaintance with any near 
Corsa person the count fair wife 

I humble beg your grace will not mistake 
the condition of my duty 

I beg of thou not to mistake the sense 
of my design my word import my heart 
and both no danger unto thou 

I hope my skill in servitude will not 
provoke my prince to tempt my honour 

what prolix love be this do thou indent 
with my acceptance make choice of service 

your grace will give i leave since that I know 
I not deserve to share in your high secret 
to doubt my safety in know this 

death and horror thy suspicion be too thin 
Consider why I send the count to Lucca 
upon my life thou be secure therefore 
reply unto my former question 

my gracious lord I have some interest 
in her woman 

in Corsa woman know to thou 

she be perhaps 

discharge thy tongue may my ear blister 
if they digest word to thy prejudice 

perhaps I know she beyond the modest strain 

there be gold Castruchio show some pity 
on rebellious blood be my harbinger 
billet i this night where she do lie 
and thou be make for ever 

must it be this night 

strict opportunity will have it so

I can say herself shall porter be 
unto your entrance but her woman shall 

enough here be more gold summon up thy brain 
thy heart thy soul to meet in consolation 
and so contrive my peace farewell 

I will instruct your grace ever long both when 
and how to make this armorous assault 

myself and my exchequer be thy own 
there need no art to work he into evil 
he be bad enough to infect the devil 

good they have leave the garden door unlock 
I will venture in to help discovery 
Castruchio be grace with rare employment 
the duke and he do here consume the night 
these be hour for ghost adulterer 
and thief the slave be haggard at supper 
be full of gold his vain appetite 
feed at Nero rate I be discard 
with a frown shake like a burr from his sleeve 
as if my closure heretofore have be 
impertinent ambition lessen all 
beneath itself to nothing the high 
we do stand so much less those man appear 
who we behold below hark kind fortune 
lend i thy ear 

the night grow age now it be fit the duke 
will hasten his departure in troth wench 
thy service to he exceed requital 
but what she take it willing 

no but she do not 

pox on these modest lie I say she do 

in troth you do abuse she then I be sure 
her shriek do scare my heart up to my lip 

then thou can have kiss hearty 

I wonder it waken not the whole house 

be it possible what mean do the duke use 
to stifle up this noise 

nay I know not but since she be no more 
pliant it do repent i much I ever 
be instrument to his other action 

what repent I prithee sweet Duarte 
wrong not divinity so much waste not 
a virtue that will more profit other 
and to suppose that the lady be ravish 
be a heresy which my soul must never 
be guilty of do not I know woman 
be a kind of soft wax that will receive 
any impression 

and do not I know there be difference 
in workman as in wax hard wax when cold 
accept of no impression by coldness 
I in far chastity for chastity 
be cold 

but those workman be hard far 
than that hard wax and it be hard of all 
to find those workman unless by Russia 
where the people freeze till they spit snow Come 
kiss i chuck again once more 

a precious satirist this surly dog 
inveigh against lechery in other because 
he will engross all woman to himself 

your great thief be common beget 
when parent do their lechery by stealth 
man get coward when fright in the act 
and by such vulgar consequence it be now 
a proper time to beget a pander 
one that may hereafter do other man 
the same office which we do the duke now 
Come shall we in and try 

you presume much on a easy nature 
and how extravagant you be abroad 
I be not so unkind to question 

faith wench I have some interest in every child 
that play in the street the duke come down go go 
give your lady a caudle and let i hear 
how she like her new bedfellow I will meet 
his grace two hour hence when he have dismiss 
those thought which still succeed unlawful lust 

o damn villainy be this the employment 
that do make you proud I will haunt you still 
to strengthen my intelligence 

o silly weak evasion be dark 
I creep within my cloak it be modesty 
in sin to practise every disguise 
to hide it from the world but creature free from guilt 
affect the sun and hate the dark because 
it hide their innocence o traitor lust 
that lead we with encouragement to fight 
and when we have discharge our vein for thou 
we be besiege with thought that more perplex we 
then the former for then we do complain 
of strength but now of weakness more 
away away it be time that I be go 
the modest morn do blush in the east as if 
ashamed to see so foul a ravisher

chamber but a court cupboard 

but they make he amends in his diet 

they can sir for he be a faint eater 
if he will pray so often as he fast 
he have be at liberty long ago 
he will dine upon a single pea and leave Orts 

do they no more regard his potent hope 

Alas sir when fortune tippet stand up

I be sure of that 

nay that be too evident 

o sir I will not has give this rush 
to have be assure all the office in his gift 
but hang such duke I say that suffer thus 
their favourite to be imprison 

how now Borachio do thou speak treason 

sir I have say no more than what I mean 
to unsay again which be but a kind 
of lose one labour and it be better 
to be ill employ then to be idle 

how the slave sow his proverb together

I have declare my interest in your blood 
if you assist my plot you needs must share

that be wear your beard upon your tongue talk 
brave but of all avoid Dorido 
as you will to drink 
a violent poison 

enough he be a stranger to my thought 

there be fresh encouragement 

a little more of this mettle will puzzle 
my Geography be this Italy 
or the Indies there Borachio weep no more 
for thy master 

alas I be apt to weep though I but see 
a onion strip naked 

I think to meet thy master here I be sure 
I see the warrant sign for his release 

the devil take your worship for i why 
do you bring such good news on a worky day 

but thou pray ill in pray the devil 
to take i

be my master at liberty 

I will defer a answer of this until 
thy own eye be a little elder 

well be he still in favour with the duke 

why he shall short govern all at court 
and be a very mote in the duke be eye 

enough it be not wholesome to burst with joy 

but what then 

I have think with much care on these office 
and find myself fit to be in they 
I will have they all come cut and longtail 
for my wife will be such a glad woman 

look who come there 

o sir give i your blessing 

weep not Borachio I have prepare 
such bloody art in my revenge as make 
man wit more famous than their cruelty 
let horror propagate all be too little 
for my use but you sir have the honour 
to release i

sir now he suppose you in durance 
and be himself secure happy drink 
or ride in the stew you may take some 
advantage on his soul too lose no time 

that be my intent 
for it be dull humanity to aim 
no far than his life I will pursue he 
even to hell 

and let i alone so to facilitate 
the project by search of fit time and mean 
as shall declare the act less troublesome 
then thus to threaten it with word 

you signior Castruchio signior coxcomb 
be you tire with do well you have scarce 
bring my poor lord out of the prison door 
but you long to have he in again nay 
never look for my sword dwell within a yard 
of my tongue and shall defend what I say

into new broil 

bold miscreant if I but stir 

nay signior let he alone Borachio 
steep thy wrath in cold water follow 
and be dumb all shall be well

but I will follow your heel so close as I will 
go near to tread upon your kibe 

signior I know you a brave commander 
under the great Petruchio and since 
that time your constant virtue have deserve 
more recompense than fate will minister 
by i my kindness be no miracle 
since gratitude be only sick not dead 
but pray believe what I have say be truth 

o sir it be the error of unskilful love 
to be too constant in her charity 
to all but I have ground more relative 
to make i jealous of the truth and I 
believe you with my heart and yet it be strange 
do this Castruchio think his haggard fate 
can triumph over i because in lust 
the devil do instruct his industry 
dare he attempt my life 

I give you real ground for my suspense 
reward sir may make a villain bloody 
though it can make he valiant the duke 
will let he want no gold 

nay it be often see 
among the several creature of a prince 
such instrument as these most profit reap 
employment noble do requite themselves 
and honour pay the great of heart who lose 
but time in service which be the body wealth

I have proof that will even dam my sister 
and convince thou too

and this constancy deserve some kindness 
therefore if it be decree that I must die 
let i die a modest death expose not 
your poor wife unto the cruelty 
of ravisher 

what think you sir 

my thought continue in the former sense 
I have a chaste and virtuous wife however 
you desire assurance from a trial 
so unkind as this 

still methinks that jewel which he give she 
procure the same requital that my sister make 
but let it pass I do conjure you both 
as you have be soldier to keep your tongue 
a safe distance from your ear let not word 
disperse what you have hear it be external 
reputation that keep some man from sin 
our fault once know we do neglect to mend 
since reputation suffer still for that 
admit of help but it be never cure 
and so the fatal jar between man and wife 
if secret keep dissension fall asleep 
but if once know to fame fame talk so loud 
she wake it again your silence signior 
shall challenge much from my requital 

beside our obligation to your worth 
even both our honour will impose it 
as a virtue not a trouble we be 
your humble servant 

I will deserve you for my friend rise 
you must be clear by a strict trial 
till when I do neglect the large charter 
of husband over their wife and command you 
as a judge the offender hence and become 
my prisoner in your closet take heed 
no curiosity in fear make you 
to pry in my design 

I do obey you cheerful 

o my heart shall my industry and hope 
find this period my sufferance be tire 
it be a old inconstancy in fate 
soon to erect and soon to ruinate 

sing gentle youth who know if I shall live 
to imploy thy voice again 

this be your dirge 

hah who be there

the door 

farewell youth get he to bed 

but where be the wriggle hag the incestuous lump 
of heat where be she speak 

Alas sir who do you mean 

why she that gossip with the devil dam 
the subtle bawd your woman o sister Corsa kneel 
I have hear all nay do not work distinction thus 
kneel not to i you be my patron wife 
but yet where obligation be endear 
there injury condemn itself can you 
survive a wrong so eminent a wrong 
commit against your husband and my patron 

o sir I hope if you have hear the truth 
you will conclude it as a rape in the duke 
and no adultery in i 

how a rape o weak and immodest shift 
be Aretine alive or have I bring 
a crew of midwife here who obscene art 
may warrant the distinction good 
although the cause do blush to own the effect 
yet thy appeal may stand but here be none 
if compulsion do insist until 
enforcement breed delight we can say 
the female suffer acceptance at the last 
disparage the not consent at the first 
call her denial her unskilfulness 
and not a virtuous frost in the blood 
Come sit thou down or if you mean to pray 
kneel and be nimble in devotion 
that be to die 

my noble brother 
do not fright my sufferance use i kind 
with your tongue and look I be already 
reconcile to heaven and will perhaps 
consent to your design 

bless speech thou shall prescribe my gesture 
and my phrase 

it be not unnatural in i to wish 
for life yet mind what construction 
the world may make of my sinister chance 

ay there be the point the giddy multitude 
have neither skill nor leisure to convince 
supposition with argument of strength 
and charity their quick censure bring such 
effect as spectacle when use in haste 
which then do rather aggravate the shape 
then give distinction of the form who who 
will live to be a argument for they 

do you conclude then that I must now die 

why be it not apt and pregnant to your sense 
it shall be so 

ere I take my last leave of my kind lord 

ceremonious form do oft so long 
delay our journey till it prove too late 
to reach our home it be a long way to heaven 
we must make haste nay if your courage fail 
before it come unto the test I shall 
prepare to be unkind grim black fancy 
can you endure to see your lord defile 
pollute as you be that kind patron 
to all our family who constant love 
be warrant by time that best can judge 
of constancy who take you to his bed 
upon condition cheap and dangerous 
to his own estate 

sir speak no more but use i as you please 
I will obey in all 

Come stretch down your arm and permit this scarf 
to fasten it to the chair then vail your eye 
we must not trust a woman valour so

in this basin bleed till dryness make they curl 
like lutestring in the fire

his humble sacrifice he will not be more 
unwilling to grant atonement then I 
have be to need it the fate give other 
expiation which now they want themselves 
I speak too loud for who dare chide with they 
that may employ thunder 

her beauty begin to wither she distil 
like to a rose o can I separate 
the blood defile from what be pure I will 
shed that then restrain the current know 
unskilful nature if operation 
shall long subsist in such gross mixture man 
will be devil ere they live in hell 

I come celestial choir 

ecstasy through weakness in expense of blood 
dear sister disturb not your last minute 

I must ascend 

how will you enter heaven with fetter on 
your soul clog with these mortal limb sit down 
expire in peace 

o my brother while I be yet humane 
let i feel some interest in your blood 
what fault of i deserve impediment 
in my last journey if my lord be here 
he will have see i use with mercy 

sweet soul these be but mistake of weakness 

will not my lord be merciful to i 
and to my memory 

sit still I bring no negative reply 
thy worth shall shine in such a character 
that be dead he need must woo thy ghost 

and will posterity consent that I 
abide in list with those of modest fame 

that astrologer who spy thou first 
within a star must not find thou billet 
near to Venus such error in his act 
will make i wreathe his body into cord 
and with prolix strength draw the dull caitiff 
through his slender optic 

o o o 

a convulsion in her artery 

mercy heaven 

hark 
as she ascend the sphere do welcome she 
with their own music her soul be go 
hah whether be it go o vast suspense 
madness succeed inquiry fool of nature 
what ancestor that die long since have bring 
we news of his abode or tell we how 
they use he in the other world o this 
wild mystery so much concern man 
that we will willing dismiss suspense 
with eyesight not with consequence 
for he that see through faith but flatter doubt 
faith be a perspective through who narrow lane 
little thing far off seem so much too great 
too near that what be first unknown be more 
estrange from knowledge than it be before 
yet by the rule of lawful notion it 
go well with she for she be ever give 
to prayer superstitious in humility 
and even unthrifty in her charity 
she hold her virtue in such high extreme 
that her divinity be troublesome 
Grew from a saint a holy cynic sleep here 
a sacrifice to thy wrong lord till I 
thy priest become a executioner 
to he who be thy cruel ravisher 

do she insist in censure of the act 
with such a stern impatience and dislike 

Even so sir my intelligence import 
for since her woman be dismiss she send 
a messenger unto Lucca to urge 
her lord return who by a labour consequence 
I do expect within this hour he will choose 
to travail in the night for privacy 

and I have send to stay he there until 
a new commission order his return 

most royal sir you then may guess what fright 
such opposition in these message 
will nourish in his heart And be young 
he can feed on doubt he will rather think 
his interest in you his privilege to err 
so slight your mandate and come home 
to settle his suspense 

remorse do cherish danger let i be safe 
secure i in thy wholesome art I will 
express myself without a tongue 

my gracious lord my apprehension lie 
not in my ear but in my brain I can 
conceive without the noise of word it show 
apparent to my intellect the count 
presume on that free address he still 
have have unto your person will hither bring Corsa and Foreste to show the shape 
and quality of his new sufferance 
be you within your bed to free you from 
the world suspicion while I do place 
behind the gallery door which lead unto 
your closet chapel such trusty spirit 
as shall dare to thrust their weapon home 

o quintessence of soul I will devote 
my action whole to thy use good night 

May slumber cease upon your royal eye 
with gentle closure know poor Foreste 
the bag that hold my gall be so immense 
that when I steep thou in it thou be drown 

Castruchio I have better think upon it 

my gracious lord 

I will not have thou hurt my boy use he 
kind for my sake 

shall I not strike he here between the rib 

not for the world thou do not know his soul 
he be of so soft so sweet a property 
that he enchant where he be know beside 
I find I be so powerful over his youth 
that I shall soon extirpate from his memory 
the wrong I do his wife and he as for 
Foreste his experience be of growth 
too stubborn of practice stiff and will not 
be remove from his revenge by strength of word 
therefore let he no mercy feel but let 
my boy be gentle use for my sake farewell 

this be a silly kind of love 
but let i think so to contrive this plot 
that Lothario may destroy Foreste 
and he to make his silence safe humh 

no it must not be 

my royal lord 

Lucio my boy be not proscribe take heed 
Castruchio if thou do extend thy hand 
in motion boisterous and rough to he 
thou do infect all thy other kindness 
and I shall see thou as a cockatrice 
that will enforce my opticnerve to shrink 
and pull my eye into my skull look to it 

most gracious sir be his person bulwark 
with the Alps be he hide in his own fear 
he can not be more safe than you have make he 

once more than good night 

a plague upon this turdy love such thought 
when first your blood do make your vein to swell 
like Bridge over your flesh have prevent 
my employment soft soft 
fear and suspicion ever walk on egg 

leave here the light and go to bed 
break open the door break open the door 

hah who counsel so unlawful 

o Foreste the fatal hour be come 
ring out your bell until they wake the dead 
let the drum murmur in a sable bag 
reverse your musket and trail your stubborn pike 
in slimychannel let trumpet groan 
and the shrill phip be hoarse the fatal hour 
be come 

why what be the matter sir 

o my wife by this she do entreat i 
sudden upon some urgent cause 
to haste from Lucca to she just now

enough to have divorce her from my mercy

deprive you of your soul 

how be this language lawful unto i 
thy sovereign prince do not highprovidence 
treble the assurance of my safety 
by guard invisible when I be first 
predestinate to this supreme function 
and dare thou tempt the strength of heaven 

I know to be a profane curiosity 
in i to question the prerogative 
of a free prince for ignorance and a dull 
easy faith must flatter bondage still 
or liberty the eldest child of nature 
confound predominance by sue for 
equality among the son of man 
and so revoke a chaos 

which soon return unless distinction 
persuade thou fix my royalty above 
thy reach that be my natural subject 

enough false sir warm not the air with word 
be still or I conclude you in a trice 
and now requite the leisure I permit 
for prayer by a true reply to what 
I shall demand 

I will 

look on your opposite 
do you ever make she a adulteress 
speak truth so come your soul to heaven

on the last day to hide himself in the crowd

but what mean that jewel which you give she 
and which she conceal till its own lustre 
do betray it 

I give it to disguise the cause for which 
I send the other unto Corsa

I strive to be propitious 

I know Luinna thou be merciful

bargain we do make in the church to share 
in sufferance

to censure on the error of my prince

who time himself shall never parallel 
though he survey his old record and scratch 
his reverend head to waken memory 

o horror furnish we sweet heaven with some 
instinct inspire remorse or we accuse 
thy skillfulness to predestine we a prince

some iron hoop to help my rib or I shall burst 

the cause deserve great alteration 
more than mortality can see and yet

notice of it I be not singe to death 
with lightning like the door nor murder through 
the ear with thunder like a bat o Lucio

that to secure his master foot will spread 
and scatter all his limb for he to walk upon 

and Foreste who industry and care

of general account he may avouch

which way they go 

hell and the pillory take such dull ear 
it can be but they have pass the cloister 
and ere this with help of private key 
enter the duke bedchamber

that reward which your black soul shall receive 
in hell yet know the law will here on earth 
provide such torture as shall make your death 
exemplary to all succeed time
