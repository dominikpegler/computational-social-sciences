Foscari be depart 

in a mist be he not here be but we three 
the duchess be a strange woman

distinguish they to a atom tell i signior 
and be not partial to the sex do ever 
upon thy honour meet with such a creature 
we here call virtuous woman be not all

to exchange her dull virginity for marriage 
Foscari who our ambition point at be lose 
and he in some disgust go hence

motive of his anger shall be lay to 
our charge but what you think make our person 
safe and great 

we come with humble modesty to require 
so much as shall concern our care both 
of your gracious self and our good country 
Foscari duke of Parma be a great prince 
feature a lady like your excellence

his catholic majesty do late by 
his lieger urge a title to this duchy

I will be active in my reign in large 
my duchy Genon be proud it shall 
grow humble I have a long arm it will reach 
Florence or if I chance to lay my hand on Parma 
I shall gripe it till my fist ache ere I 
forsake my tenure 

Orseollo 

your greet be too familiar 

from whence this pride I will anger he 
my lord though I be grow above the use 
of poetry there still remain in my 
remembrance a sonnet make in praise of 
woman which if you will please to hear 

he have a bold muse that dare undertake 
so high a argument sure a woman 
be the object strike old Homer blind 
and for his eye leave he a muse I have lose 
my business 

he be not wont to speak so well of woman 

no humorist be constant to dislike 
or commendation 
nay lead the way my lord 
I be part of your attendance 

signior my affair hither require haste 
the duchess on some sudden cause have send for i 

I believe it be to take his advise about 
a masine for my wedding he be excellent 
at revel on my good lord 

you come late from she and I will know 
how you approve her present look it be the art 
of foreign courtier to visit prince 
in lucky minute when their gesture show 
they pleasant how look her grace today be 
she not physical but high and jocund 

you may without danger of your fortune 
choose this minute for conference with her grace 
signior that have cause to clear her look her thought 
grow easy to she she have find out the man 
the man that must more may be say but then 
more must be speak 

'slight why this to i how come he to know 
that I be he her highness aim at true 
the man be know nor be his worth conceal 

worth signior none but Laura give he 
notice I be the man I near speak of it 
myself my lord the man may with safety 
boast he be the best deserver in the court humh 

your lordship do he too much right it be certain 
he have be tell that I be he 

he have a glorious feature too 

nay good signior comely but not glorious 

how not glorious speak that again 

this be a pretty kind of flattery 
he will not suffer i to abuse myself 
I will admit he charm the lady or so 

that be I for I charm the lady he know 
I shall be duke it can be conceal 

the man have travail too 

never I but it seem the duchess give 
it out so the more to honour her choice 
signior I must do you justice the court 
speak you most accurate in the spanish garb 

the Spaniard signior reserve all passion 
to express his feel in accurance 
of state when in discourse his toothpick still 
be his parenthesis which he do manage 
subtle thus par les santos sennor 
lo conosco portierto porque es 
trabaso conlicenzia diuvestra alteza 
hablas muchas palabeas 
no puedo en veridad 

but why those thing signior 

this elevation of the shoulder be a 
politic gesture declare a meaning hide 
which you may find out if you can and be 
often use in trivial circumstance 
I question this your man 

your lordship must speak my mother tongue then 

be don Diego within 

stay slave we will be as politic as he 
which don Diego do you mean he that play 
the sloven in the great church the english 
have a proverb on he 

why not he of Valdez or any other Diego 

be not enrage my lord those grave shrug appear 
unmannerly and will before lady 
engender a suspect of vermin 

then I will prefer sir the french to your 
dislike or praise who though a surly don 
call a impertinent people giddy 
trifle yet in my esteem they merit 
high they be active even in discourse 
let we begin cheerly no matter 
on what slight or trivial subject be it 
on that single melancholy hair upon 
your chin Rise and fall by my example 

I be prepare

avec vostre menton poucce que le roy
