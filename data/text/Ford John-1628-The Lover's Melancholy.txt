whenas a prince so potent can shun 
motion of passion to be man my lord 
be to be but the exercise of care 
in several shape as misery do grow 
they alter as man form but how none know 

this little I will of Cyprus sure abound 
in great wonder both for change and fortune 
than any you have see abroad 

then any 
I have observe abroad all country else 
to a free eye and mind yield something rare 
and I for my part have bring home one jewel 
of admirable value 

jewel Menaphon 

a jewel my Amethus a fair youth 
a youth who if I be but superstitious 
I shall repute a excellence more high 
then mere creation be to add delight 
I will tell you how I find he 

prithee do 

pass from Italy to Greece the tale 
which poet of a elder time have feign 
to glorify their Tempe breed in i 
desire of visit that paradise 
to Thessaly I come and live private 
without acquaintance of more sweet companion 
than the old inmate to my love my thought 
I day by day frequent silent grove 
and solitary walk vide famistradam lib 2 Prolas 6 Acad 3 imitat Claudian one morning early 
this accident encounter i I hear 
the sweet and most ravish contention 
that art or nature ever be at strife in 

I can yet conceive what you infer 
by art and nature 

I shall soon resolve you 
a sound of music touch my ear or rather 
indeed intrance my soul as I steal near 
invite by the melody I see 
this youth this fairfaced youth upon his lute 
with strain of strange variety and harmony 
proclaim as it seem so bold a challenge 
to the clear chorister of the wood the bird 
that as they flock about he all stand silent 
wonder at what they hear I wonder too 

and so do I good on 

a nightingale 
nature best skill musician undertake 
the challenge and for every several strain 
the wellshaped youth can touch she sing she down 
he can not run division with more art 
upon his quake instrument than she 
the nightingale do with her various note 
reply too for a voice and for a sound 
Amethus it be much easy to believe 
that such they be then hope to hear again 

how do the rival part 

you term they right 
for they be rival and their mistress harmony 
some time thus spend the young man grow at last 
into a pretty anger that a bird 
who art have never teach cliff mood or note 
shall vie with he for mastery who study 
have busy many hour to perfect practice 
to end the controversy in a rapture 
upon his instrument he play so swift 
so many voluntary and so quick 
that there be curiosity and cunning 
concord in discord line of differ method 
meet in one full centre of delight 

now for the bird 

the bird ordain to be 
music first martyr strive to imitate 
these several sound which when her warble throat 
fail in for grief down drop she on his lute 
and break her heart it be the quaint sadness 
to see the conqueror upon her hearse 
to weep a funeral elegy of tear 
that trust i my Amethus I can chide 
my own unmanly weakness that make i 
a fellowmourner with he amet I believe thou 

he look upon the trophy of his art 
then sigh then wipe his eye then sigh and cry 
alas poor creature I will soon revenge 
this cruelty upon the author of it 
henceforth this lute guilty of innocent blood 
shall never more betray a harmless peace 
to a untimely end and in that sorrow 
as he be pash it against a tree 
I sudden step in 

thou have discourse 
a truth of mirth and pity 

I reprieve 
the intend execution with entreaty 
and interruption but my princely friend 
it be not strange the music of his hand 
do overmatch bird when his voice and beauty 
youth carriage and discretion must from man 
endue with reason ravish admiration 
from i they do 

but be this miracle 
not to be see 

I win he by degree 
to choose i his companion whence he be 
or who as I dare modest inquire 
so gentle he will woo not to make know 
only for reason to himself reserve

of sleep and surfeit in the university

of neither art nor honesty you may 
command my head pray take it do it be better

a speedy restitution of such ship 
as by your father be long since detain

these near part 
of Syria that adjoin muster their friend 
and by intelligence we learn for certain 
the syrian will pretend a ancient interest 
of tribute intermit 

through your land 
your subject mutter strange and imagine 
more than they dare speak public 

and yet 
they talk but odd of you 

hang they mongrel

by all your love I charge you without fear 
or flattery to let i know your thought 
and how I be interpret speak bold 

for my part sir I will be plain and brief 
I think you be of nature mild and easy 
not willing provoke but withal headstrong 
in any passion that mislead your judgement 
I think you too indulgent to such motion 
as spring out of your own affection 
too old to be reform and yet too young 
to take fit council from yourself of what 
be most amiss 

So tutor your conceit 

I think you dote with pardon let i speak it 
too much upon your pleasure and these pleasure 
be so wrap up in selflove that you covet 
no other change of fortune will be still 
what your birth make you but be loath to toil 
in such affair of state as break your sleep 

I think you will be by the world repute 
a man in every point complete but be 
in manner and effect indeed a child 
a boy a very boy 

may it please your grace 
I think you do contain within yourself 
the great elixir soul and quintessence 
of all divine perfection be the glory 
of mankind and the only strict example 
for earthly monarchy to square out their life by 
time miracle fame pride in knowledge wit 
sweetness discourse arm art 

you be a courtier 

but not of the ancient fashion an it like your highness it be I I that be the credit of the court noble prince and if thou will by proclamation or patent create i overseer of all the tailor in thy dominion then then the golden day shall appear again bread shall be cheap fool shall have more wit knave more honesty and beggar more money

Nothing I only dare to name he that be all

thou have a tongue I hope that be not oil 
with flattery be open though it be true 
that in my young day I oft have hear 
Agenor name my father more traduce 
than I can then observe yet I protest 
I never have a friend a certain friend 
that will inform i thorough of such error 
as oftentimes be incident to prince

between these mineral as if one vein 
of earth have nourish both the gentle myrtle 
be not ingraft upon a olives stock 
yet nature have between they lock a secret 
of sympathy that be plant near 
they will both in their branch and their root 
embrace each other twine of ivy round 
the well grow oak the vine do court the elm 
yet these be different plant Parthenophil 
consider this aright than these sleight creature 
will fortify the reason I shall frame 
for that ungrounded as thou think affection 
which be submit to a stranger pity

to every law of noble honesty 
that to transgress the vow of perfect friendship 
I hold a sacrilege as foul and curse 
as if some holy temple have be rob 
and I the thief 

thou be unwise young man 
to enrage a lioness 

it be unjust 
to falsify a faith and ever after 
disrobe of that fair ornament live naked
