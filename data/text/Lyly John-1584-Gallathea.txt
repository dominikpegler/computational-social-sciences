the sun do beat upon the plain field wherefore let we sit down Galathea under this fair oak by who broad leaf be defend from the warm beam we may enjoy the fresh air which soft breathe from Humber flood 

father you have devise well and while our flock do roam up and down this pleasant green you shall recount to i if it please you for what cause this tree be dedicate unto Neptune and why you have thus disguise i 

I do agree thereto and when thy state and my care be consider thou shall know this question be not ask in vain 

I willing attend 

in time past where thou see a heap of small pebble stand a stately temple of white marble which be dedicate to the god of the sea and in right be so near the sea hither come all such as either venture by long travel to see country or by great traffic to use merchandise offer sacrifice by fire to get safety by water yield thank for peril past and make prayer for good success to come but fortune constant in nothing but inconstancy do change her copy as the people their custom for the land be oppress by Dane who instead of sacrifice commit sacrilege in steed of religion rebellion and make a prey of that in which they shall have make their prayer tear down the temple even with the earth be almost equal with the sky enrage so the god who bind the wind in the hollow of the earth that he cause the sea to break their bound sith man have break their vow and to swell as far above their reach as man have swerve beyond their reason then may you see ship sail where sheep feed anchor cast where plough go fisherman throw their net where husbandman sow their corn and fish throw their scale where fowl do breed their quill then may you gather froth where now be dew rot weed for sweet rose and take view of monstrous mermaid instead of pass fair maid 

to hear these sweet marvel I will my eye be turn also into ear 

but at the last our countryman repent and not too late because at last Neptune either weary of his wrath or wary to do they wrong upon condition consent to ease their misery 

what condition will not miserable man accept 

the condition be this that at every five year day the fair and chaste virgin in all the country shall be bring unto this tree and here be bind who neither parentage shall excuse for honour nor virtue for integrity be leave for a peace offer unto Neptune 

dear be the peace that be buy with guiltless blood 

I be not able to say that but he send a monster call the Agar against who come the water roar the fowl fly away and the cattle in the field for terror shun the bank 

and she bind to endure that horror 

and she bind to endure that horror 

do this monster devour she 

whether she be devour of he or convey to Neptune or drown between both it be not permit to know and incur danger to conjecture now Galathea here end my tale and begin thy tragedy 

Alas father and why so 

I will thou have be less fair or more fortunate then shall thou not repine that I have disguise thou in this attire for thy beauty will make thou to be think worthy of this God to avoid therefore destiny for wisdom rule the star I think it better to use a unlawful mean your honour preserve then intolerable grief both life and honour hazard and to prevent if it be possible thy constellation by my craft now have thou hear the custom of this country the cause why this tree be dedicate unto Neptune and the vex care of thy fearful father 

father I have be attentive to hear and by your patience be ready to answer destiny may be defer not prevent and therefore it be better to offer myself in triumph than to be draw to it with dishonour have nature as you say make i so fair above all and shall not virtue make i as famous as other do you not know or do overcarefulness make you forget that a honourable death be to be prefer before a infamous life I be but a child and have not live long and yet not so childish as I desire to live ever virtue I mean to carry to my grave not grey hair I will I be as sure that destiny will light on i as I be resolve it can not fear i nature have give i beauty virtue courage nature must yield i death virtue honour suffer i therefore to die for which I be bear or let i curse that I be bear sith I may not die for it 

Alas Galathea to consider the cause of change thou be too young and that I shall find they out for thou too too fortunate 

the destiny to i can be so hard as the disguise hateful 

to gain love the god have take shape of beast and to save life be thou coy to take the attire of man 

they be beastly god that lust can make they seem as beast 

in health it be easy to counsel the sick but it be hard for the sick to follow wholesome counsel well let we depart the day be far spend 

fair nymph be you stray from your company by chance or love you to wander solitary on purpose 

fair boy or god or whatever you be I will you know these wood be to i so well know that I can stray though I will and my mind so free that to be melancholy I have no cause there be none of Diana train that any can train either out of their way or out of their wit 

what be that Diana a goddess what her nymph virgin what her pastime hunt 

a goddess who know it not virgin who think it not hunt who love it not 

I pray thou sweet wench among all your sweet troop be there not one that follow the sweet thing sweet love 

love good sir what mean you by it or what do you call it

if it be nothing else it be but a foolish thing 

try and you shall find it a pretty thing 

I have neither will nor leisure but I will follow Diana in the chase who virgin be all chaste delight in the bow that wound the swift heart in the forest not fear the bow that strike the soft heart in the chamber this difference be between my mistress Diana and your mother as I guess Venus that all her nymph be amiable and wise in their kind the other amorous and too kind for their sex and so farewell little god 

Diana and thou and all thou shall know that Cupid be a great god I will practise a while in these wood and play such prank with these nymph that while they aim to hit other with their arrow they shall be wound themselves with their own eye 

Come Phillida fair Phillida and I fear i too fair be my Phillida thou know the custom of this country and I the greatness of thy beauty we both the fierceness of the monster Agar every one think his own child fair but I know that which I most desire and will least have that thou be fair thou shall therefore disguise thyself in attire lest I shall disguise myself in affection in suffer thou to perish by a fond desire who I may preserve by a sure deceit 

dear father nature can not make i so fair as she have make you kind nor you more kind than i dutiful whatsoever you command I will not refuse because you command nothing but my safety and your happiness but how shall I be disguise 

in man apparel 

it will neither become my body nor my mind 

why Phillida 

for then I must keep company with boy and commit folly unseemly for my sex or keep company with girl and be think more wanton then become i beside I shall be ashamed of my long hose and short coat and so unware blab out something by blush at every thing 

fear not Phillida use will make it easy fear must make it necessary 

I agree since my father will have it so and fortune must

I neither like my gate nor my garment the one untoward the other unfit both unseem o Phillida but yonder stay one and therefore say nothing but o Phillida 

I perceive that boy be in as great dislike of themselves as maid therefore though I wear the apparel I be glad I be not the person 

it be a pretty boy and a fair he may well have be a woman but because he be not I be glad I be for now under the colour of my coat I shall decipher the folly of their kind 

I will salute he but I fear I shall make a curtsy instead of a leg 

if I dare trust my face as well as I do my habit I will spend some time to make pastime for say what they will of a man wit it be not second thing to be a woman 

all the blood in my body will be in my face if he shall ask i as the question among man be common be you a maid

I be send to seek other that have lose myself 

you shall see Ramia have also bite on a love leaf

indeed Ramia if lover be not virtuous then be thou vicious 

what be you come so near i 

I think we come near you when we say you love 

tush Ramia it be too late to recall it to repent it a shame therefore I pray thou tell what be love

suppose I be a virgin I blush in suppose myself one and that under the habit of a boy be the person of a maid if I shall utter my affection with sigh manifest my sweet love by my salt tear and prove my loyalty unspotted and my grief intolerable will not then that fair face pity this true heart 

admit that I be as you will have i suppose that you be and that I shall with entreaty prayer oath bribe and whatever can be invent in love desire your favour will you not yield 

trush you come in with admit 

and you with suppose 

what doubtful speech be these I fear i he be as I be a maiden 

what dread rise in my mind I fear the boy to be as I be a maiden

nay if you must weigh your fire by ounce and take measure of a man blast you may then make of a dram of wind a wedge of gold and of the shadow of one shilling make another so as you have a organist to tune your temperature 

So be it and often do it happen that the just proportion of the fire and all thing concur 

concur condog I will away

this be the day wherein you must satisfy Neptune and save yourselves call together your fair daughter and for a sacrifice take the fair for better it be to offer a virgin then suffer ruin if you think it against nature to sacrifice your child think it also against sense to destroy your country if you imagine Neptune pitiless to desire such a prey confess yourselves perverse to deserve such a punishment you see this tree this fatal tree who leaf though they glister like gold yet it threaten to fair virgin grief to this tree must the beautiful be bind do until the monster Agar carry she away and if the monster come not then assure yourselves that the fair be conceal and then your country shall be destroy therefore consult with yourselves not as father of child but as favourer of your country let Neptune have his right if you will have your quiet thus have I warn you to be careful and will wish you to be wise know that who so have the fair daughter have the great fortune in lose one to save all and so I depart to provide ceremony for the sacrifice and command you to bring the sacrifice Exit Augur 

they say Tityrus that you have a fair daughter if it be so dissemble not for you shall be a fortunate father it be a thing holy to preserve one country and honourable to be the cause 

in deed Melebeus I have hear you boast that you have a fair daughter than the which none be more beautiful I hope you be not so careful of a child that you will be careless of your country or add so much to nature that you will detract from wisdom 

I must confess that I have a daughter and I know you have but alas my child cradle be her grave and her swathclout her wind sheet I will she have live till now she shall willing have die now for what can have happen to poor Melebeus more comfortable then to be the father of a fair child and sweet country 

o Melebeus dissemble you may with man deceive the god you can do not I see and very late see your daughter in your arm whenas you give her infinite kiss with affection I fear i more than fatherly you have convey she away that you may cast we all away bereave she the honour of her beauty and we the benefit prefer a common inconvenience before a private mischief 

it be a bad cloth Tityrus that will take no colour and a simple father that can use no cunning you make the people believe that you wish well when you practise nothing but ill wish to be think religious towards the god when I know you deceitful towards man you can overreach i Tityrus overshoot yourself you may it be a wily mouse that will breed in the cat ear and he must halt cunning that will deceive a cripple do you ever see i kiss my daughter you be deceive it be my wife and if you think so young a piece unfit for so old a person and therefore imagine it to be my child not my spouse you must know that silver hair delight in golden lock and the old fancy crave young nurse and frosty year must be thaw by youthful fire but this matter set aside you have a fair daughter Tityrus and it be pity you be so fond a father 

you be both either too fond or too froward for while you dispute to save your daughter we neglect to prevent our destruction 

Come let we away and seek out a sacrifice we must sift out their cunning and let they shift for themselves 

Come Cupid to your task first you must undo all these lover knot because you tie they 

if they be true love knot it be unpossible to unknit they if false I never tie they 

make no excuse but to it 

love knot be tie with eye and can be undo with hand make fast with thought and can be unloose with finger have Diana no task to set Cupid to but thing impossible I will to it 

why how now you tie the knot fast 

I can choose it go against my mind to make they lose 

let i see now it be unpossible to be undo 

it be the true love knot of a woman heart therefore can be undo 

that fall in sunder of itself 

it be make of a man thought which will never hang together 

you have undo that well 

ay because it be never tide well 

to the rest for she will give you no rest these two knot be fine untie 

it be because I never tide they the one be knit by Pluto not Cupid by money not love the other by force not faith by appointment not affection 

why do you lay that knot aside 

for death 

why 

because the knot be knit by faith and must only be unknit of death 

why laugh you 

because it be the fair and the false do with great art and least truth with best colour and worst conceit 

who tide it 

a man tongue 

why do you put that in my bosom 

because it be only for a woman bosom 

why what be it 

a woman heart 

Come let we go in and tell that Cupid have do his task stay you behind Larissa and see he sleep not for love will be idle and take heed you surfeit not for love will be wanton Exit Telusa 

let i alone I will find he somewhat to do 

lady can you for pity see Cupid thus punish 

why do Cupid punish we without pity 

be love a punishment 

it be no pastime 

o Venus if thou see Cupid as a captive bind to obey that be wont to command fear lady threat that once pierce their heart I can tell whether thou will revenge it for despite or laugh at it for disport the time may come Diana and the time shall come that thou that set Cupid to undo knot shall entreat Cupid to tie knot and you lady that with solace have behold my pain shall with sigh entreat my pity 
he offer to sleep 

how now Cupid begin you to nod 

Come Cupid Diana have devise new labour for you that be god of love you shall weave sampler all night and lackey after Diana all day you shall short shoot at beast for man because you have make beast of man and weight on lady train because thou entrap lady by train all the story that be in Diana arras which be of love you must pick out with your needle and in that place sow Vesta with her nun and Diana with her nymph how like you this Cupid 

I say I will prick as well with my needle as ever I do with my arrow 

Diana can yield she conquer affection 

Diana shall yield she can conquer destiny 

Come Cupid you must to your business 

you shall find i so busy in your head that you shall wish I have be idle with your heart 

this day be the solemn sacrifice at this tree wherein the fair virgin be not the inhabitant faithless shall be offer unto i but so over careful be father to their child that they forget the safety of their country and fear to become unnatural become unreasonable their slight may blear man deceive i they can I will be here at the hour and show as great cruelty as they have do craft and well shall they know that Neptune shall have be entreat not cozen Exit 

I marvel what virgin the people will prepresent it be happy you be none for then it will have fall to your lot because you be so fair 

if you have be a maiden too I need not to have fear because you be fair 

I pray thou sweet boy flatter not i speak truth of thyself for in my eye of all the world thou be fair 

these be fair word but far from thy true thought I know my own face in a true glass and desire not to see it in a flatter mouth 

o will I do flatter thou and that fortune will not flatter i I love thou as a brother but love not i so 

no I will not but love thou better because I can love as a brother 

see we be both boy and both lover that our affection may have some show and seem as it be love let i call thou mistress 

I accept that name for diverse before have call i mistress 

for what cause 

nay there lie the mistress 

Will not you be at the sacrifice

because I dream that if I be there I shall be turn to a virgin and then be so fair as thou say I be I shall be offer as thou know one must but will not you be there 

not unless I be sure that a boy may be sacrifice and not a maiden 

why then you be in danger 

but I will escape it by deceit but see we be resolve to be both absent let we wander into these grove till the hour be pass 

I be agree for then my fear will be pass 

why what do thou fear 

nothing but that you love i not Exit 

I will poor Phillida what shall thou think of thyself that love one that I fear i be as thyself be and may it not be that her father practise the same deceit with she that my father have with i and know she to be fair fear she shall be unfortunate if it be so Phillida how desperate be thy case if it be not how doubtful for if she be a maiden there be no hope of my love if a boy a hazard I will after he or she and lead a melancholy life that look for a miserable death

Come then and go with i and I will bring you to he straight 

bring forth the virgin the fatal virgin the fair virgin if you mean to appease Neptune and preserve your country 

here she come accompany only with man because it be a sight unseemly as all virgin say to see the misfortune of a maiden and terrible to behold the fierceness of Agar that monster 

miserable and accurse Hebe that be neither fair nor fortunate thou shall be think most happy and beautiful curse thy birth thy life thy death be bear to live in danger and have live to die by deceit be thou the sacrifice to appease Neptune and satisfy the custom the bloody custom ordain for the safety of thy country i Hebe poor Hebe man will have it so who force command our weak nature nay the god will have it so who power dally with our purpose the egyptian never cut their date from the tree because they be so fresh and green it be think wickedness to pull rose from the stalk in the garden of Palestine for that they have so lively a red and who so cut the incense tree in Arabia before it fall commit sacrilege 
shall it only be lawful among we in the prime of youth and pride of beauty to destroy both youth and beauty and what be honour in fruit and flower as a virtue to violate in a virgin as a vice but alas destiny allow no dispute die Hebe Hebe die woeful Hebe and only accurse Hebe farewell the sweet delight of life and welcome now the bitter pang of death farewell you chaste virgin who thought be divine who face fair who fortune be agreeable to your affection enjoy and long enjoy the pleasure of your curl lock the amiableness of your wish look the sweetness of your tune voice the content of your inward thought the pomp of your outward show only Hebe bid farewell to all the joy that she conceive and you hope for that she possess and you shall farewell the pomp of prince court who roof be emboss with gold and who pavement be deck with fair lady where the day be spend in sweet delight the night in pleasant dream where chastity honour affection and command yield to desire and conquer 
farewell the sovereign of all virtue and goddess of all virgin Diana who perfection be impossible to be number and therefore infinite never to be match and therefore immortal farewell sweet parent yet to be i unfortunate parent how bless have you be in barrenness how happy have I be if I have not be farewell life vain life wretched life who sorrow be long who end doubtful who misery certain who hope innumerable who fear intolerable Come death and welcome death who nature can resist because necessity rule nor defer because destiny haste Come Agar thou unsatiable monster of maiden blood and devour of beauty bowel glut thyself till thou surfeit and let my life end thou tear these tender joint with thy greedy jaw these yellow lock with thy black foot this fair face with thy foul tooth why abate thou thy wont swiftness I be fair I be a virgin I be ready Come Agar thou horrible monster and farewell world thou vile monster 

the monster be not come and therefore I see Neptune be abuse who rage will I fear i be both infinite and intolerable take in this virgin who want of beauty have save her own life and all you 

we can not find any fair 

Neptune will go deliver she to her father 

fortunate Hebe how shall thou express thy joy nay unhappy girl that be not the fair have it not be better for thou to have die with fame than to live with dishonour to have prefer the safety of thy country and rareness of thy beauty before sweetness of life and vanity of the world but alas destiny will not have it so destiny can not for it ask the beautiful I will Hebe thou have be beautiful 

Come Hebe here be no time for we to reason it have be best for we thou have be most beautiful 

we meet the virgin that shall have be offer to Neptune belike either the custom be pardon or she not think fair 

I can conjecture the cause but I fear the event 

why shall you fear the God require no boy 

I will he do then shall I have no fear 

I be glad he do not tho because if he do I shall have also cause to fear but soft what man or god be this let we close withdraw ourselves into the thicket 

and do man begin to be equal with god seek by craft to overreach they that by power oversee they do they dote so much on their daughter that they stick not to dally with our deity well shall the inhabitant see that destiny can be prevent by craft nor my anger be appease by submission I will make havoc of Diana nymph my temple shall be die with maiden blood and there shall be nothing more vile than to be a virgin to be young and fair shall be account shame and punishment in so much as it shall be think as dishonourable to be honest as fortunate to be deform 

o Neptune have thou forget thyself or will thou clean forsake i have Diana therefore bring danger to her nymph because they be chaste shall virtue suffer both pain and shame which always deserve praise and honour 

praise and honour Neptune nothing less except it be commendable to be coy and honourable to be peevish sweet Neptune if Venus can do any thing let she try it in this one thing that Diana may find as small comfort at thy hand as love have find courtesy at she 
this be she that hate sweet delight envy love desire mask wanton eye stop amorous ear bridle youthful mouth and under a name or a word constancy entertain all kind of cruelty she have take my son Cupid Cupid my lovely son use he like a prentice whip he like a slave scorn he like a beast therefore Neptune I entreat thou by no other God than the god of love that thou evil entreat this goddess of hate 

I muse not a little to see you two in this place at this time and about this matter but what say you Diana have you Cupid captive 

I say there be nothing more vain then to dispute with Venus who untamed affection have breed more brawl in heaven then be fit to repeat in earth or possible to recount in number I have Cupid and will keep he not to dandle in my lap who I abhor in my heart but to laugh he to scorn that have make in my virgin heart such deep scar 

scar Diana call you they that I know to be bleed wound alas weak deity it stretch not so far both to abate the sharpness of his arrow and to heal the hurt no love wound when they seem green rankle and have a smooth skin without fester to the death within therefore Neptune if ever Venus stand thou in stead further thy fancy or shall at all time be at thy command let either Diana bring her virgin to a continual massacre or release Cupid of his martyrdom 

it be know Venus that your tongue be as unruly as your thought and your thought as unstaid as your eye Diana can chatter Venus can choose 

it be a honour for Diana to have Venus mean ill when she so speak well but you shall see I come not to trifle therefore once again Neptune if that be not bury which can never die fancy or that quench which must ever burn affection show thyself the same neptune that I know thou to be when thou be a shepherd and let not Venus word be vain in thy ear since thy be imprint in my heart 

it be unfit that goddess shall strive and it be unreasonable that I shall not yield and therefore to please both both attend Diana I must honour her virtue deserve no less but Venus I must love I must confess so much 
Diana restore Cupid to Venus and I will for ever release the sacrifice of virgin if therefore you love your nymph as she do her son or prefer not a private grudge before a common grief answer what you will do 

I account not the choice hard for have I twenty Cupid I will deliver they all to save one virgin know love to be a thing of all the vain virginity to be a virtue of all the noble I yield Larissa bring out Cupid and now shall it be say that Cupid save those he think to spoil 

I agree to this willing for I will be wary how my son wander again but Diana can forbid he to wound 

yes chastity be not within the level of his bow 

but beauty be a fair mark to hit 

well I be glad you be agree and say that Neptune have deal well with beauty and chastity 

here take your son 

sir boy where have you be always take first by Sappho now by Diana how happen it you unhappy elf 

come through Diana wood and see so many fair face with fond heart I think for my sport to make they smart and so be take by Diana 

I be glad I have you 

and I be glad I be rid of he 

alas poor boy thy wing clip thy brand quench thy bow burn and thy arrow break 

ay but it skill not I bear now my arrow in my eye my wing on my thought my brand in my ear my bow in my mouth so as I can wound with look fly with think burn with hear shoot with speak 

well you shall up to heaven with i for on earth thou will lose i 

but soft what be these 

those that have offend thou to save their daughter 

why have you a fair daughter 

ay and Melebeus a fair daughter 

where be they 

in yonder wood and methinks I see they come 

well your desert have not get pardon but these goddess jar 

this be my daughter my sweet Phillida 

and this be my fair Galathea 

unfortunate Galathea if this be Phillida 

accurse Phillida if that be Galathea 

and be thou all this while enamour of Phillida that sweet Phillida 

and can thou dote upon the face of a maiden thyself be one on the face of fair Galathea 

do you both be maiden love one another 

I have think the habit agreeable with the sex and so burn in the fire of my own fancy 

I have think that in the attire of a boy there can not have lodge the body of a virgin and so be inflame with a sweet desire which now I find a sour deceit 

now thing fall out as they do you must leave these fond fond affection nature will have it so necessity must 

I will never love any but Phillida her love be engrave in my heart with her eye 

nor I any but Galathea who faith be imprint in my thought by her word 

a idle choice strange and foolish for one virgin to dote on another and to imagine a constant faith where there can be no cause of affection how like you this Venus 

I like well and allow it they shall both be possess of their wish for never shall it be say that nature or fortune shall overthrow love and faith be your love unspotted begin with truth continue with constancy and not to be alter till death 

die Galathea if thy love be not so 

accurse be thou Phillida if thy love be not so 

suppose all this Venus what then 

then shall it be see that I can turn one of they to be a man and that I will 

be it possible 

what be to love or the mistress of love unpossible be it not Venus that do the like to Iphis and Ianthe how say you be you agree one to be a boy present 

I be content so I may embrace Galathea 

I wish it so I may enjoy Phillida 

soft daughter you must know whether I will have you a son 

take i with you Galathea I will keep you as I beget you a daughter 

Tityrus let you be a boy and if you will i shall not 

nay my shall not for by that mean my young son shall lose his inheritance 

why then get he to be make a maiden and then there be nothing lose 

if there be such change I will Venus can make my wife a man 

why 

because she love always to play with man 

well you be both fond therefore agree to this change or suffer your daughter to endure hard chance 

how say you Tityrus shall we refer it to Venus 

I be content because she be a goddess 

Neptune you will not dislike it 

not I 

nor you Diana 

not I 

Cupid shall not 

I will not 

then let we depart neither of they shall know who lot it shall be till they come to the churchdoor one shall be do it suffice 

and satisfy we both do it not Galathea 

yes Phillida 

Come Robin I be glad I have meet with thou for now we will make our father laugh at these tale 

what be these that so malapart thrust themselves into our company 

forsooth madam we be fortune teller 

fortune teller tell i my fortune 

we do not mean fortune teller we mean fortune teller we can tell what fortune we have have these twelve month in the wood 

let they alone they be but peevish 

yet they will be as good as minstrel at the marriage to make we all merry 

I lady we bear a very good consort 

can you sing 

base 

and you 

mean 

and what can you do 

if they double it I will treble it 

then shall you go with we and sing Hymen before the marriage be you content 

content never better content for there we shall be sure to fill our belly with capon rump or some such dainty dish 

then follow we 

go all it be I only that conclude all you lady may see that Venus can make constancy fickleness courage cowardice modesty lightness work thing impossible in your sex and temper hard heart like soft wool yield lady yield to love lady which lurk under your eyelid while you sleep and play with your heart string while you wake who sweetness never breed satiety labour weariness nor grief bitterness Cupid be beget in a mist nurse in cloud and suck only upon conceit confess he a conqueror who you ought to regard sith it be unpossible to resist for this be infallible that love conquer all thing but itself and lady all heart but their own
