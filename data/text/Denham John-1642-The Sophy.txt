my lord you have good intelligence what news 
from the army any certainty 
of their design or strength 

we know not their design but for their strength 
the disproportion be so great we can but 
expect a fatal consequence 

how great my lord 

the Turk be fourscore thousand foot 
and fifty thousand horse and we in the whole 
exceed not forty thousand 

methinks the prince shall know 
that judgement be more essential to a general 
than courage if he prove victorious 
it be but a happy rashness 

but if he lose the battle it be a error 
beyond excuse or remedy consider 
that half the lesser Asia will follow 
the victor fortune 

it be his single virtue 
and terror of his name that wall we in 
from danger be he lose the naked empire 
will be a prey expose to all invader 

but be it not necessary 
the king shall know his danger 

to tell he of so great a danger 
be but to draw a great on ourselves 
for though his eye be open as the morning 
towards lust and pleasure yet so fast a lethargy 
have seize his power towards public care and danger 
he sleep like death 

he be a man of that strange composition 
make up of all the worst extremity 
of youth and age 

and though 
he feel the heat of youth and cold of age 
yet neither temper nor correct the other 
as if there be a ague in his nature 
that still incline to one extreme 

but the caliph or Haly or some that know 
his soft hour may best acquaint he with it 

Alas they show he nothing 
but in the glass of flattery if any thing 
may bear a show of glory fame or greatness 
it be multiply to a immense quantity 
and stretch even to divinity 
but if it tend to danger or dishonour 
they turn about the perspective and show it 
so little at such distance so like nothing 
that he can scarce discern it 

it be the fate of prince that no knowledge 
come pure to they but pass through the eye 
and ear of other man it take a tincture 
from every channel and still bear a relish 
of flattery or private end 

but danger and necessity 
dare speak the truth 

but common 
they speak not till it be too late 
and for Haly 
he that shall tell he of the prince danger 
but tell he that himself be safe 

clear up clear up sweet Erythaea 
that cloud that hang upon thy brow presage 
a great storm than all the turkish power 
can throw upon we methinks I see my fortune 
settle her look by thou and in thy smile 
sit victory and in thy frown our ruin 
why shall not hope 
as much erect our thought as fear deject they 
why shall we 
anticipate our sorrow it be like those 
that die for fear of death 
what be it you doubt his courage or his fortune 

envy itself can never doubt his courage 

then let not love do worse by doubt that 
which be but valour slave a wise welltempered valour 
for such be he those giant death and danger 
be but his minister and serve a master 
more to be fear than they and the blind goddess 
be lead among the captive in his triumph 

I have rather she have eye for if she see he 
sure she will love he better but admit 
she be at once a goddess and his slave 
yet fortune valour all be overbear 
by number as the long resist bank 
by the impetuous torrent 

that be but rumour 
never do the Turk invade our territory 
but fame and terror double still their file 
but when our troop encounter than we find 
scarce a sufficient matter for our fury 
but hark a post Solyman conduct he in 
it be sure from the prince 

give it our secretary I hope the prince be well 

the letter will inform you 

sir the lord attend you

with the enemy and thus they will betray we 
first give we up to want then to contempt 
and then to ruin but tell those son of earth 
I will have their money or their head 
it be my command when such occasion be 
no plea must serve it be cruelty to spare 

the prince transport with his youthful heat 
I fear have go too far it be some disaster 
or else he will not send so thick well bring he in 
I be prepare to hear the worst of evil 

what be the prince besiege in his trench 
and must have speedy aid or die by famine 
or have he rash try the chance of war 
and lose his army and his liberty 
tell i what province they demand for ransom 
or if the worst of all mishap have fall 
speak for he can not die unlike himself 
speak free and yet methinks I read 
something of better fortune in thy look 
but dare not hope it 

sir the prince live 

And have not lose his honour 

as safe in honour as in life 

nor liberty 

free as the air he breathe 

return with speed 
tell he he shall have money victual man

a fair retreat I shall account it more 
than all his former conquest those huge number 
arm with despair the flower of all the empire 

sir I have not use to tell you tale or fable 
and why shall you suspect your happiness 
be so constant on my life it be true sir

what be the prince return with safety it be above

the greatness of our state or joy 
behold he come

as Phoebus be to jove when he have slay 
the ambitious giant that assail the sky 
and as my power resemble that of jove 
so shall thy glory like high Phoebus shine 
as bright and as immortal 

great sir all acquisition 
of glory as of empire here I lay before 
your royal foot happy to be the instrument 
to advance either sir I challenge nothing 
but be a humble suitor for these prisoner 
the late commander of the turkish power 
who valour have deserve a better fortune 

then what have thy deserve the be thy brave Mirzah 
worthy of all thy royal ancestor 
and all those many kingdom which their virtue 
or get or keep though thou have not be bear to it 
but daughter still your look be sad 
no long I will defer your joy go take he 
into thy chaste embrace and whisper to he 
that welcome which those blush promise 

my Erythaea why entertain thou with so sad a brow 
my long desire return thou be wont 
with kiss and sweet smile to welcome home 
my victory though buy with sweat and blood 
and long expect 

pardon sir 
it be with our soul 
as with our eye that after a long darkness 
be dazzle at the approach of sudden light 
when in the midst of fear we be surprise 
with unexpected happiness the first 
degree of joy be mere astonishment 
and it be so late in a dreadful dream 
I see my lord so near destruction 
deprive of his eye a wretched captive 
then shriek myself awake then sleep again 
and dream the same my ill presage fancy 
suggest still it be true 

then I forgive thy sadness since love cause it 
for love be full of fear and fear the shadow 
of danger like the shadow of our body 
be great then when that which be the cause 
be far off 

but still there be something 
that check my joy 
nor can I yet distinguish 
which be the apparition this or that 

a apparition 
at night I shall resolve that doubt and make 
thy dream more please 

the time have be my lord 
when I be no such stranger to your thought 
you be not wont to wear upon your brow 
a frown or smile but still have think i worthy 
at least to know the cause 

it be true 
thy breast have ever be the cabinet 
where I have lock my secret 

and do you ever find 
that any art can pick the lock or power 
can force it open 

no I have ever find thou 
trusty and secret but be it observe in the court 
that I be sad 

observe it be all man wonder and discourse 
that in a joy so great so universal 
you shall not bear a part 

discourse of too 

nothing but treason 
more common more bold speak 
so singular a sadness 
must have a cause as strange as the effect 
and grief conceal like hide fire consume 
which flame out will call in help to quench it 

but since thou can not mend it 
to let thou know it will but make thou worse 
silence and time shall cure it 

but in disease when the cause be know 
it be more than half the cure you have my lord 
my heart to counsel and my hand to act 
and my advice and action both have meet 
success in thing unlikely 

but this 
be such a secret I dare hardly trust it 
to my own soul and though it be a crime 
in friendship to betray a trust counsel 
yet to conceal this be a great crime 
and of a high nature 

now I know it 
and your endeavour to conceal it 
speak it more plain it be some plot upon the prince 

o thou have touch my sore and have search it 
now heal it if thou can the prince do hate i 
or love i not or love another better 
which be all one This be know in court 
have render i despise and scorn of all 
for I that in his absence 
blaze like a star of the first magnitude 
now in his bright sunshine be not see 
no application now no troop of suitor 
no power no not so much as to do mischief 

my lord I be ashamed of you 
so ill a master in a art so long 
profess and practise by you to be angry 
and angry with a prince and yet to show it 
in a sad look or womanish complaint 
how can you hope to compass your design 
and not dissemble they go flatter and adore he 
stand first among the crowd of his admirer 

o I have often spread those net but he 
have ever be too wise to think they real 

however 
dissemble still thank he for all his injury 
take they for favour if at last 
you can gain he some pretty nimble poison 
may do the feat or if he will abroad 
find he some brave and honourable danger 

have I not find he out as many danger 
as Juno do for Hercules yet he return 
like Hercules double in strength and honour 

if danger can do it then try pleasure 
which when no other enemy survive 
still conquer all the conqueror endeavour 
to soften his ambition into lust 
contrive fit opportunity and lay 
bait for temptation 

I will leave nothing unattempted 
but sure this will not take for all his passion 
affection and faculty be slave 
only to his ambition 

then let he fall by his own greatness 
and puff he up with glory till it swell 
and break he first betray he to himself 
then to his ruin from his virtue suck a poison 
as spider do from flower praise he to his father 
you know his nature let the prince glory 
seem to eclipse and cast a cloud on he 
and let fall something that may raise his jealousy 
but lest he shall suspect it draw it from he 
as fisher do the bait to make he follow it 

but the old king be so suspicious 

but withal 
most fearful he that view a fort to take it 
plant his artillery against the weak part 
work on his fear till fear have make he cruel 
and cruelty shall make he fear again 
methinks my lord you that so oft have sound 
and fathom all his thought that know the deep 
and shallows of his heart shall need no instrument 
to advance your end his passion and his fear 
lie leiger for you in his breast and there 
negotiate their affair 

Solyman be it your care to entertain the captain 
and the prisoner and use they kind 

sir I be not for entertainment now I be melancholy 

what grieve for our good fortune 

no sir but now the war be do we want pretence 
to put off creditor I be haunt sir 

not with ghost 

no sir 
material and substantial devil 

I know the cause what be it thou owe they 

not much sir but so much as spoil i for a good fellow 
it be but 2000 dollar a small sum to you sir 

well it shall be pay 

then if the devil come for drink let i alone with he 
well drink I love thou but too well already 
but I shall love thou better hereafter I have often 
drink myself into debt but never out of debt till now 

captain methinks you look like fish out of water 
I see the court be not your element 
you must to the war again 

faith sir these young gallant be so take up with 
their mistress I doubt their edge be take off from 
the war 

ay and their back too 

but for we old one we be weary of be laugh at 
by these court hobbyhorse for make leg and 
kiss hand unhandsome 

and to be censure by the she critic because our 
leg be big than the court standard 
and therefore out of fashion 

and such a giggle because one band be unpin 
another beard not well turn up and such a 
fiddlefaddle it be not to be endure 

well howsoever you be deal with 
pray let these stranger find such entertainment 
as you will have desire 
have but the chance of war determine it 
for they as now for we and you brave enemy 
forget your nation and ungrateful master 
and know that I can set so high a price 
on valour though in foe as to reward it 
with trust and honour 

sir your twice conquer vassal 
first by your courage than your clemency 
here humble vow to sacrifice their life 
the gift of this your unexampled mercy 
to your command and service 

I pray my lord second my suit 
I have already move the king in private 
that in our next year expedition they may have 
some command 

I shall my lord 
and glad of the occasion 
I wonder sir you will leave the court the sphere 
where all your grace in full lustre shine 

i Haly but the reputation 
of virtuous action pass if not keep up 
with a access and fresh supply of new one 
be lose and soon forget and like palace 
for want of habitation and repair 
dissolve to heap of ruin 

but can you leave sir 
your old indulgent father and forsake 
the embrace of so fair so chaste a wife 
and all the beauty of the court beside 
be mad in love and dote upon your person 
and be it not better sleep in their arm 
then in a cold pavilion in the camp 
where your short sleep be break and interrupt 
with noise and alarm 

Haly thou know not i how I despise 
these short and empty pleasure and how low 
they stand in my esteem which every peasant 
the mean subject in my father empire 
enjoy as full in as high perfection 
as he or I and which be have in common 
by beast aswell as man wherein they equal 
if not exceed we pleasure to which we be lead 
only by sense those creature which have least 
of reason most enjoy 

be not 
the empire you be bear to a scene large enough 
to exercise your virtue there be virtue 
civil aswell as military for the one 
you have give the world a ample proof already 
now exercise the other it be no less 
to govern just make your empire flourish 
with wholesome law in riches peace and plenty 
then by the expense of wealth and blood to make 
new acquisition 

that I be bear so great I owe to fortune 
and can pay that debt till virtue set i 
high in example as I be in title 
till what the world call fortune gift my action 
may style their own reward and those too little 
prince be then themselves when they arise 
more glorious in man thought then in their eye 

sir your fame 
already fill the world and what be infinite 
can receive degree but will swallow 
all that be add as our caspian sea 
receive our river and yet seem not full 
and if you tempt she more the wind of fortune 
may come about and take another point 
and blast your glory 

no 
my glory be past danger they be full blow 
thing that be blast be but in their bud 
and as for fortune I nor love nor fear she 
I be resolve go Haly flatter still your age master 
still sooth he in his pleasure and still grow 
great by those art 
well farewell court 
where vice not only have usurp the place 
but the reward and even the name of virtue 
we will go and hunt it be a princely sport 
and much resemble war 

such war as we 
where we have use to follow chase 

it show we pretty danger and acquaint we 
with situation while I view the hill 
the thicket and the river here methinks 
with best advantage I can pitch my camp 
here range my army there the battle join 
here make a safe retreat and there enclose 
the enemy as beast within a toil 
and yet I can observe the chase stag 
how he can cast about to seek his safety 
and when he see his death be unavoidable 
how he will weep I can observe the dog too 
how some in swiftness some in scent excel 
other in cry but let we lose no time 
methinks the court a prison 

still still 
slight and scorn yet this affront 
have stamp a noble title on my malice 
and marry it to justice the king be old 
and when the prince succeed 
I be lose past all recovery than I 
must meet my danger and destroy he first 
but cunning and close or his son 
and wife like a fierce tigress will devour i 
there be danger every way and since it be so 
it be brave and noble when the fall weight 
of my own ruin crush those I hate 
but how to do it that be the work he stand 
so high in reputation with the people 
there be but one way and that be to make his father 
the instrument to give the name and envy 
to he but to myself the prize and glory 
he be old and jealous apt for suspicion against which tyrant ear 
be never close the prince be young 
fierce and ambitious I must bring together 
all these extreme and then remove all medium 
that each may be the other object 

my lord 
now if your plot be right you be befriend 
with opportunity the king be melancholy 
apt for any ill impression 
make a advantage of the prince absence 
urge some suspect cause of his departure 
use all your art he be come 

sir have you know a action of such glory 
less swell with ostentation or a mind 
less taint with felicity it be a rare temper in the prince 

be it so rare to see a son so like 
his father have not I perform action 
as great and with as great a moderation 

I sir but that be forget 
action on the last age be like almanac of the last year 

it be well but if with all his conquest what I get in empire 
I lose in fame I think myself no gainer 
but be I quite forget 

sir you know 
age breed neglect in all and action 
remote in time like object 
remote in place be not behold at half their greatness 
and what be new find better acceptation 
then what be good or great yet some old man 
tell story of you in their chimney corner 

no otherwise 

they be all so full of he some magnify 
his courage some his wit but all admire 
a greatness so familiar 

sure Haly 
thou have forget thyself be thou a courtier 
or I a king my ear be unacquainted 
with such bold truth especial from thou 

sir when I be call to it I must speak 
bold and plain 

but with what eagerness what circumstance 
unasked thou take such pain to tell i only 
my son be the better man 

sir where subject want the privilege 
to speak their king may have the privilege 
to live in ignorance 

if it be a secret that concern my life 
or empire than this boldness may become thou 
but such unnecessary rudeness savour 
of some design 
and this be such a false and squinteyed praise 
which seem to look upward on his glory 
look down upon my fear I know thou hate he 
and like infect person fain will rub 
the ulcer of thy malice upon i 

sir I almost believe you speak your thought 
but that I want the guilt to make i fear it 

what mean these guilty blush then 

sir if I blush it be because you do not 
to upbraid so try a servant that so often 
have wake that you may sleep and be expose 
to danger for your safety 

and therefore think 
thou be so wrap so weave into all 
my trust and counsel that I now must suffer 
all thy ambition aim at 

sir if your love grow weary 
and think you have wear i long enough I be willing 
to be leave off but he be a foolish seaman 
that when his ship be sink will not 
unlade his hope into another bottom 

I understand no allegory 

and he be as ill a courtier that when 
his master be old desire not to comply 
with he that must succeed 

but if 
he will not be comply with 

o sir 
there be one sure way and I have know it practise 
in other state 

what be that 

to make 
the father life the price of the son favour 
to walk upon the grave of our dead master 
to our own security 
it be this must take do this plainness please you sir 

thou know my nature too too apt 
to these suspicion but I hope the question 
be never move to thou 

in other kingdom sir 

but have my son no such design 

Alas 
you know I hate he and shall I tell you 
he have you will say it be but malice 

no more of that good Haly I know thou love i 
but least the care of future safety tempt thou 
to forfeit present loyalty or present loyalty 
forfeit thy future safety 
I will be your reconciler call he hither 

o sir I wish he be within my call or you 

why where be he 

he have leave the court sir 

I like not these excursion why so sudden 

it be but a sally of youth yet some say he be discontent 

that grate my heartstring what shall discontent he 
except he think I live too long 

heaven forbid 
and yet I know no cause of his departure 
I be sure he be honour and love by all 
the soldier god the people idol 

i Haly 
the persian still worship the rise sun 
but who go with he 

none but the captain 

the captain I like not that 

never fear it sir 
it be true they love he but as their general not their prince 
and though he be most forward and ambitious 
it be temper with so much humility 

and so much the more dangerous 
there be some that use 
humility to serve their pride and seem 
humble upon their way to be the proud 
at their wish journey end 

sir I know not 
what way or end you mean it be true 
in popular state or where the prince title 
be weak and must be prop by the people power 
there by familiar way it be necessary 
to win on man affection but none of these 
can be his end 

but there be another end 
for if his glory rise upon the ruin 
of i why not his greatness too 

true sir 
ambition be like love impatient 
both of delay and rival but nature 

but empire 

I have almost forget sir he have 
a suit to your majesty 

what be it 

to give the turkish prisoner some command 
in the next action 

nay then it be too apparent 
he fear my subject loyalty 
and now must call in stranger come deal plain 
I know thou can discover more 

I can discover sir 
the depth of your great judgement in such danger 

what shall I do Haly 

your wisdom be so great it be presumption for i to advise 

well we will consider more of that but for the present 
let he with speed be send for Mahomet I thank thou 
I have one faithful servant honest Haly 

how do he take it 

swallow it as greedy 
as parch earth drink rain 
now the first part of our design be over 
his ruin but the second our security 
must now be think on 

my lord you be too sudden though his fury 
determine rash yet his cold fear 
before it execute consult with reason 
and that not satisfy with show or shadow 
will ask to be convince by something real 
now must we frame some plot and then discover it 

or intercept some letter which ourselves 
have forge before 

and still admire the miracle 
and thank the providence 

then we must draw in somebody 
to be the public agent that may stand 
betwixt we and danger and the people envy 

who fit than the grand caliph 
and he shall set a grave religious face 
upon the business 

but if we can work he 
for he be so full of foolish scruple 
or if he shall prove false and then betray we 

betray we sure my lord your fear have blind 
your understanding for what serve the king 
will not his threat work more than our persuasion 
while we look on and laugh and seem as ignorant 
as unconcern and thus appear friend 
to either side on both may work our end 

my lord the turkish pasha 
desire access 

admit they I know their business 

they long to hear with what success you move 
the king in their behalf 

but now they be come I will make they do my business 
better than I do they 

leave we a while 

my lord my duty and affection to the prince 
and the respect I owe to man of honour 
extort a secret from i which yet I grieve to utter 
the prince depart leave to i the care 
of your affair which I as he command 
have recommend to the king but with so unlooked for 
a success 

my lord fear not to speak our doom while we 
fear not to hear it we be lose before 
and can be ready now to meet that fate 
we then expect 

though he that bring unwelcome news 
have but a lose office yet he that show 
your danger first and then your way to safety 
may heal that wound he make you know the king 
with jealous eye have ever look awry 
on his son action but the fame and glory 
of the last war have raise another spirit 
envy and jealousy be twine together 
yet both lie hide in his dissemble smile 
like two conceal serpent till I unhappy I 
move this question tread upon they both 
and rouse their sleep anger then cast from he 
his doubt and straight confirm in all his fear 
decree to you a speedy death to his own son 
a close restraint but what will follow 
I dare not think you by a sudden flight may find your safety 

sir death and we be not such stranger 
that we shall make dishonour or ingratitude 
the price of life it be the prince gift 
and we but wear it for his sake and service 

then for his sake and service 
pray follow my advice though you have lose the favour 
of your unworthy master yet in the province 
you late govern you have those dependence 
and interest that you may raise a power 
to serve the prince I will give he timely notice 
to stand upon his guard 

my lord we thank you 
but we must give the prince intelligence 
both when and how to employ we 

if you will write 
commit it to my care and secrecy 
to see it safe convey 

we shall my lord 

these man be once the prince foe and then 
unwilling they make he great but now 
be his friend shall willing undo he 
and which be more be still his friend 
what little art govern the world we need not 
a arm enemy or corrupt friend 
when service but misplace or love mistake 
perform the work nor be this all the use 
I will make of they when once they be in arm 
their master shall be wrought to think these force 
raise against he and this shall so endear i 
to he that though dull virtue and the god 
overcome my subtle mischief I may find 
a safe retreat and may at least be sure 
if not more mighty to be more secure 

but Haly what confederate have the prince 
in his conspiracy 

sir I can yet suspect 
none but the turkish prisoner and that only 
from their late sudden flight 

be they flee for what 

that their own fear best know their entertainment 
I be sure be such as can not minister 
suspicion or dislike but sure they be conscious 
of some intend mischief and be flee 
to put it into act 

This still confirm i more 
but let they be pursue let all the passage 
be well secure that no intelligence 
may pass between the prince and they 

it shall be do sir 

be the caliph prepare 

he be without sir 
and wait your pleasure 

call he 

I have a great design to act in which 
the great part be thou in brief it be this 
I fear my son high spirit and suspect 
design upon my life and crown 

sure sir your fear be causeless 
such thought be stranger to his noble soul 

no it be too true I must prevent my danger 
and make the first attempt there be no such way 
to avoid a blow as to strike first and sure 

but sir I hope my function shall exempt i 
from bear any part in such design 

your function laugh do you think that prince 
will raise such man so near themselves for nothing 
we but advance you to advance our purpose 
nay even in all religion 
their learned and their seem holy man but serve 
to work their master end and varnish over 
their action with some specious pious colour 
no scruple do it or by our holy prophet 
the death my rage intend to he be thou 

sir it be your part to will i to obey 

then be wise and sudden 

my lord it grieve i to relate the cause 
of this assembly and it will grieve you all 
the prince you know stand high in all those grace 
which nature second by fortune give 
wisdom he have and to his wisdom courage 
temper to that and unto all success but 
ambition the disease of virtue breed 
like surfeit from a undigested fullness 
meet death in that which be the mean of life 
great Mahomet to who our sovereign life 
and empire be most dear appear thus 
advise i in a vision tell the king 
the prince his son attempt his life and crown 
and though no creature live that more admire 
his virtue nor affect his person more 
than I yet zeal and duty to my sovereign 
have cancel all respect nor must we slight 
the prophet revelation 

Remember sir he be your son 
endear to you by a double bond 
as to his king and father 
and the remembrance of that double bond 
double my sorrow it be true 
nature and duty bind he to obedience 
but those be place in a low sphere 
his fierce ambition like the high mover 
have hurry with a strong impulsive motion 
against their proper course but since he have forget 
the duty of a son I can forget 
the affection of a father 

but sir in the begin of disease 
none try the extreme remedy 

but when they be sudden 
the cure must be as quick when I be dead you will say 
my fear have be too slow treason be act 
assoon as thought though they be never believe 
until they come to act 

but consider sir 
the greatness of the attempt the people love he 
the looker on and the inquire vulgar 
will talk themselves to action thus by avoid 
a danger but suppose you tempt a real one 

those king who envy or the people murmur 
deter from their own purpose deserve not 
nor know not their own greatness 
the people murmur it be a sulphurous vapour 
breathe from the bowel of the base earth 
and it may soil and blast thing near itself 
but ere it reach the region we be place in 
it vanish to air we be above 
the sense or danger of such storm 

true sir they be but storm while royalty 
stand like a rock and the tumultuous vulgar 
like billow raise with wind that be with opinion 
may roar and make a noise and threaten 
but if they roll too near they be dash in piece 
while they stand firm 

yet sir crown be not place so high 
but vulgar hand may reach they 

then it be when they be place on vulgar head 

but sir 
look back upon yourself why shall your son 
anticipate a hope so near so certain we may wish and pray 
for your long life but neither prayer nor power 
can alter fate decree or nature law 
why shall he ravish then that diadem 
from your grey temple which the hand of time 
must short plant on he 

my lord 
I see you look upon i as a sun 
now in his west half bury in a cloud 
who ray the vapour of approach night 
have render weak and faint but you shall find 
that I can yet shoot beam who heat can melt 
the waxen wing of this ambitious boy 
nor run my blood so cold nor be my arm 
so feeble yet but he that dare defend he 
shall feel my vengeance and shall usher i 
into my grave 

sir we defend he not 
only desire to know his crime it be possible 
it may be some mistake or misreport 
some false suggestion or malicious scandal 
or if ambition be his fault it be you 
he have it from you when he have his be 
nor be it he fault nor you for it be in prince 
a crime to want it from a noble spirit 
ambition can no more be separate 
then heat from fire or if you fear the vision 
will you suspect the noble prince because 
this holy man be trouble in his sleep 
because his crazy stomach want concoction 
and breed ill fume or his melancholy spleen 
send up fantastic vapour to his brain 
dream be but dream these causeless fear become not 
your noble soul 

who speak another word 
have speak his last great Mahomet we thank thou 
protector of this empire and this life 
thy care have meet my fear this on presumption 
strong and apparent I have long presage 
and though a prince may punish what he fear 
without account to any but the god 
wise state as often cut off ill that may be 
as those that be and prevent purpose 
before they come to practise and foul practise 
before they grow to act you can but observe 
how he dislike the court his rude departure 
his honour from the people and the soldier 
his seek to oblige the Turk his prisoner 
their sudden and suspect flight 
and above all his restless tower thought 

if the business be important 
admit he 

sir upon your late command 
to guard the passage and search all packet 
this to the prince be intercept 

here Abdall read it 

sir we be assure how unnatural your father intention 
be towards you and how cruel towards we we have 
make a escape not so much to seek our own 
as to be instrument of your safety we will be 
in arm upon the border upon your command 
either to seek danger with you or to receive you 
if you please to seek safety with we 

now my lord 
alas my fear be causeless and ungrounded 
fantastic dream and melancholic fume 
of crazy stomach and distemper brain 
have this convince you 

sir we see 
some reason you shall fear but who we know not 
it be possible these turk may play the villain 
know the prince the life of all our hope 
staff of your age and pillar of your empire 
and have fail by force may use this art 
to ruin he and by their treason here 
to make their peace at home 
now shall this prove a truth when he have suffer 
death or disgrace which be to he the same 
it will be too late to say you be mistake 
and then to cry he mercy sir we beseech you 
a while suspend your doom till time produce 
her wont offspring truth 

and so expect 
the event of what you think shall prove the experiment 
of what I fear but since he be my son 
I can have such violent thought towards he 
as he towards i he only shall remain 
a prisoner till his death or my enlarge he 

away away we be serious 

but not so serious to neglect your safety 

be thou in earnest 

nay sir I can be serious aswell as my better 

what be the matter 

no I be a inconsiderable fellow and know nothing 

let we hear that nothing then 

the Turk sir 

what of they 

when they can not overcome you by force they will 
do it by treachery 

as how 

nay I can see as far into a millstone as another man 
they have corrupt some illaffected person 

what to do 

to nourish jealousy betwixt you and your sconce 

my son where be he 

they say he be post hither 

Haly we be betray prevent look to the port and let 
the guard be double how far be his army hence 
be the city in arm to join with he 

arms and join with he I understand you not 

do thou not say the prince be come 

I hear some foolish people say you have send for 
he as a traitor which to my apprehension be on 
purpose speak to make you odious and he desperate 
and so divide the people into faction a plot of 
dangerous consequence as I take it sir 

and be this all thou saucy trifle fool away 
with he 

sir this seem fool be a conceal dangerous knave 
under that safe disguise he think he may say or do 
any thing you will little think he the chief conspirator 
the only spy to inform the prince of all be do in court 

let he be rack and torture till he confess 
the whole conspiracy 

rack and torture I have tell you all I know and more 
there be nothing more in i sir but may be squeeze 
out without rack only a stoop or two of wine 
and if there have not be too much of that you have 
not have so much of the other 

that be your cunning sirrah 

Cunning sir I be no politician and be ever think to have 
too little wit and too much honesty for a statesman 

away with he 

but something must be do sir to satisfy the people 
it be not enough to say he do design 
or plot or think but do attempt some violence 
and then some strange miraculous escape 
for which our prophet must have public thanks 
and this false colour shall delude the eye 
of the amaze vulgar 

it be well advise 

sir his highness be return 

and unconstrained but with what change of countenance 
do he receive the message 

with some amazement 
but such as spring from wonder not from fear 
it be so unexpected 

leave we 
Haly I ever find thou honest true to i 
than my own blood and now be the time to show it 
for thou be he my love and trust have choose 
to put in action my design surprise he 
as he shall pass the gallery I will place 
a guard behind the arras when thou have he 
since blind with ambition he do soar 
like a seel dove his crime shall be his punishment 
to be deprive of sight which see perform 
with a hot steel now as thou love my safety 
be resolute and sudden 

it be severe 
but yet I dare not intercede it shall be do 
but be that word irrevocable 

ay as year or age past relent not if thou do 

why so melancholy be the design discover 

no but I be make the instrument 
that still endeavour to disguise my plot 
with borrow look and make they walk in darkness 
to act they now myself be make the mark 
for all the people hate the princess curse 
and his son rage or the old king inconstancy 
for this to tyranny belong 
to forget service but remember wrong 

but can not you contrive 
some fine pretence to cast it on some other 

no he dare trust no other have I give 
but the least touch of any private quarrel 
my malice to his son not care of he 
have then beget this service 

it be but tother plot my lord you know 
the king by other wife have many son 
Soffy be but a child and you already 
command the emperor guard procure for i 
the government of the city when he die 
urge how unfortunate those state have be 
who prince be but child then set the crown 
upon some other head that may acknowledge 
and owe the empire to your gift 

it shall be do abdall who command 
the city be the prince friend and therefore 
must be displace and thou shall straight succeed he 
thou be my better genius honest Mirvan 
greatness we owe to fortune or to fate 
but wisdom only can secure that state 

you be double welcome now my lord your come 
be so unlooked for 

to i I be sure it be 
know thou the cause for sure it be important 
that call i back so sudden 

I be so ignorant 
I know not you be send for 
wake I know no cause but in my sleep 
my fancy still present such dream and terror 
as do Andromache the night before 
her Hector fall but sure it be more than fancy 
either our guardian angel or the god 
inspire we or some natural instinct 
foretells approach danger 

how do my father 

still talk and play with Fatyma but he mirth 
be force and strain in his look appear 
a wild distract fierceness I can read 
some dreadful purpose in his face but where 
this dismal cloud will break and spend his fury 
I dare not think pray heaven make false his fear 
sometime his anger break through all disguise 
and spare nor god nor man and than he seem 
jealous of all the world suspect and start 
and look behind he 

sir with hazard of my life I have venture 
to tell you you be lose betray undo 
rouse up your courage call up all your counsel 
and think on all those stratagem which nature 
keep ready to encounter sudden danger 

but pray my lord by who for what offence 

be it a time for story when each minute 
beget a thousand danger the god protect you 

this man be ever honest and my friend 
and I can see in his amaze look 
something of danger but in act or think 
I never do that thing shall make i fear it 

nay good sir let not so secure a confidence 
betray you to your ruin 

prithee woman 
keep to thyself thy fear I can know 
that there be such a thing I stand so strong 
enclose with a double guard of virtue 
and innocence that I can look on danger 
as he that stand upon a rock 
can look on storm and tempest fear and guilt 
be the same thing and when our action be not 
our fear be crime 
and he deserve it less that guilty bear 
a punishment than he that guiltless fear 

this be the place appoint assist i courage 
this hour end all my fear but pause a while 
suppose I shall discover to the prince 
the whole conspiracy and so retort it 
upon the king it be a handsome plot 
but full of difficulty and uncertain 
and he be so fool with downright honesty 
he will never believe it and now it be too late 
the guard be set and now I hear he come 

it be ominous but I will on destruction 
overtake as often those that fly as those that bold meet it 

by your leave prince your father greet you 

unhand i traitor 

that title be your own and we be send to let you know it 
be not that the voice of Haly that thunder in my ear 

ay virtuous prince I come to make you exercise 
one virtue more your patience 

insolent villain for what cause 

only to gaze upon a while until your eye be out 

o villain shall I not see my father 
to ask he what be my crime who my accuser 
let i but try if I can wake his pity 
from his lethargic sleep 

it must not be sir 

shall I not see my wife nor bid farewell 
to my dear child 

your prayer be all in vain 

thou shall have half my empire Haly let i but 
see the tyrant that before my eye be lose 
they may dart poisonous flash like the basilisk 
and look he dead these eye that still be open 
or to foresee or to prevent his danger 
must they be close in eternal night 
can his thirst of blood be satisfy 
with any but his own and can his tyranny 
find out no other object but his son 
I seek not mercy tell he I desire 
to die at once not to consume a age 
in linger death 

our ear be charm away with he 

can you behold you god a wrong innocent 
or sleep your justice like my father mercy 
or be you blind as I must be 

I ever fear the prince too much greatness 
will make he less the great height be near 
the great precipice 

it be in worldly accident 
as in the world itself where thing most distant 
meet one another thus the east and west 
upon the globe a mathematic point 
only divide thus happiness and misery 
and all extreme be still contiguous 

or if betwixt happiness and misery there be 
a distance it be a airy vacuum 
nothing to moderate or break the fall 

but o this saintlike devil 
this damn caliph to make the king believe 
to kill his son be religion 

poor prince how be they mislead 
while they who sacred office it be to bring 
king to obey their god and man their king 
by these mysterious link to fix and tie 
they to the footstool of the deity 
even by these man religion that shall be 
the curb be make the spur to tyranny 
they with their double key of conscience bind 
the subject soul and leave king unconfined 
while their poor vassal sacrifice their blood 
to ambition and to avarice their good 
blind with devotion they themselves esteem 
make for themselves and all the world for they 
while heaven great law give for their guide appear 
just or unjust but as it wait on they 
use but to give the echo to their word 
power to their will and edge to their sword 
to varnish all their error and secure 
the ill they act and all the world endure 
thus by their art king awe the world while they 
religion as their mistress seem to obey 
yet as their slave command she while they seem 
to rise to heaven they make heaven stoop to they 

nor be this all where feign devotion bend 
the high thing to serve the low end 
for if the manyheaded beast have break 
or shake from his neck the royal yoke 
with popular rage religion do conspire 
flow into that and swell the torrent high 
then power first pedigree from force derive 
and call to mind the old prerogative 
of freeborn man and with a saucy eye 
search the heart and soul of majesty 
then to a strict account and censure bring 
the action error and the end of king 
tread on authority and sacred law 
yet all for God and his pretend cause 
act such thing for he which he in they 
and which themselves in other will condemn 
and thus engage nor safe can retire 
nor safe stand but blind bold aspire 
force their hope even through despair to climb 
to new attempt disdain the present time 
grow from disdain to threat from threat to arm 
while they though son of peace still sound the alarm 
thus whether king or people seek extreme 
still conscience and religion be their theme 
and whatsoever change the state invade 
the pulpit either force or persuade 
other may give the fuel or the fire 
but they the breath that make the flame inspire 

This and much more be true but let not we 
add to our ill and aggravate misfortune 
by passionate complaint nor lose ourselves 
because we have lose he for if the tyrant 
be to a son so noble so unnatural 
what will he be to we who have appear 
friend to that son 

Well think on and in time 
farewell unhappy prince while we thy friend 
as stranger to our country and ourselves 
seek out our safety and expect with patience 
heaven justice 

let we rather act it then expect it 
the prince injury at our hand require 
more than our tear and patience 
his army be not yet disband 
and only want a head thither we will fly 
and all who love the prince or hate the tyrant 
will follow we 

noble resolve and either we will restore 
the prince or perish in the brave attempt 
you god since what we mean to execute 
be your high office to avenge the innocent 
assist we with a fortune equal to 
the justice of our action lest the world 
shall think itself delude and mistrust 
that you want will or power to be just 

it be do and it be my masterpiece to work 
my safety betwixt two dangerous extreme 
now like a skilful sailor have I pass 
Scylla and Charybdis I have escape the rock 
of steep ambition and the gulf of jealousy 
a danger less avoid because less fear 

what be do my lord 

enough I warrant you imprison and deprive of sight 

no more this but provoke he can you think 
yourself secure and he alive 

the rest of the business will do itself 
he can aswell endure a prison as a wild bull the net 
there let he struggle and toil himself to death 
and save we so much envy 

but if his father shall relent such injury 
can receive no excuse or colour but to be 
transfer upon his counselor and then 
the forfeiture of they redeem his error 

we must set a mark upon his passion 
and as we find it run low 
what ebb from he into our rage shall flow 
why shall we be more wicked 
than we must needs 

nay if you stick at conscience 
more gallant action have be lose for want of be 
complete wicked then have be perform 
by be exact virtuous it be hard to be 
exact in good or excellent in ill 
our will want power or else our power want skill 

but gentleman be the king in earnest 
I can scarce believe it 

you will when you feel it 

I pray have any of you feel it to tell i what it be 

no sir but 
some of your fellow courtier can tell you 
that use something like it to mend their shape 
it will make you so straight and slender 

Slender because I be slender in my wit must I be draw 
Slender in my waste I will rather grow wise 
and corpulent 

Come sir it be but a little stretch 

no no more be hang and sure this will be the death of i 
I remember my grandmother die of convulsion fit 

Come sir prepare prepare 

ay for another world I must repent first 

quick then 

then first I repent that sin of be a courtier 
and second the great sin one can commit in that place the speak of truth 

have you no more sin 

some few trifle more not worth the remember 
drink and whore and swear and such like 
but for those let they pass 

have you do now 

only some good counsel to the stander by 

we thank you for that sir 

nay gentleman mistake i not 
it be not that I love you but because it be a thing of course 
for die man 

let we have it then 

First then if any of you be fool as I think that 
but a needless question be fool still and labour still 
in that vocation than the worst will be but whip 
where but for seem wise the best be rack 
but if you have the luck to be court fool those that have 
either wit or honesty you may fool withal and spare not 
but for those that want either 
you will find it rather dangerous than otherwise I can give you a modern 
instance or two but let that pass but if you happen to be state fool then it be 
but fool on the right side and all be well than you shall at least be 
wise man fellow if not wise man master 
but of all thing take heed of give any man good counsel 
you see what I have get by it and yet like a fool must 
I be do on it again 

be this all 

all but a little in my own behalf Remember gentleman 
I be at my full growth and my joint be knit and yet 
my sinew be not cable 

well we will remember it 

but stay gentleman what think you of a bottle now 

I hope you be more serious 

if you but know how dry a thing this sorrow be 
especial meet with my constitution which be 
as thirsty as any servingman 

let he have it it may be it will make he confess 

yes I shall I shall lay before you all that be within i 
and with most fluent utterance 
here be to you all gentleman and let he that be good 
nature in his drink pledge i 
So methinks I feel it in my joint already 
it make they supple 
now I feel it in my brain it make they swim 
as if the rack will be a shipwreck 

you be witty sir 

this be nothing but a poor clinch I have 
a thousand of they a trick I learn among the statesman 

hold sir you have no measure of yourself 

what do you talk of measure you will take 
measure of i with a vengeance 
well rack I defy thou do thy worst 
I will thou be man giant or monster 
gentleman now if I happen to fall asleep 
upon this engine pray wake i not too sudden 
you see here be good store of wine and if it be 
overrack it will come up with lees and all 
there I be with you again and now I be for you 

nature 
how do thou mock mankind to make he free 
and yet to make he fear or when he lose 
that freedom why do he not lose his fear 
that fear of fear the fear of what we know not 
while yet we know it be in vain to fear it 
death and what follow death it be that that stamp 
a terror on the brow of king that give 
fortune her deity and Jove his thunder 
banish but fear of death those giant name 
of majesty power empire find nothing 
to be their object will be nothing too 
then he dare yet be free that dare to die 
may laugh at the grim face of law and scorn 
the cruel wrinkle of a tyrant brow 
but yet to die so tame 
overcome by passion and misfortune 
and still unconquered by my foe sound ill 
below the temper of my spirit 
yet to embrace a life so poor so wretched 
so full of death argue a great dulness 
but I be dead already nor can suffer 
more in the other world for what be hell 
but a long sleepless night and what be their torment 
but to compare past joy with present sorrow 
and what can death deprive i of the sight 
of day of child friend and hope of empire 
and whatsoever other lose in death 
in life I be deprive of than I will live 
only to die revenge nor will I go 
down to the shade alone 
prompt i some witty some revengeful devil 
his devil that can make a bloody feast 
of his own son and call the god his guest 
here be that can kill her age sire and cast 
her brother scatter limb to wolf and vulture 
or his that slay his father to enjoy 
his mother bed and great than all those 
my father devil 
Come mischief I embrace thou fill my soul 
and thou revenge ascend and bear the sceptre 
over all my other passion banish thence 
all that be cool and tame 
know old tyrant 
my heart be too big to break I know thy fear 
exceed my suffering and my revenge 
though but in hope be much a great pleasure 
than thou can take in punish then my anger 
sink to the centre of my heart and there 
lie close in ambush till my seem patience 
have make the cruel tyrant as secure 
though with as little cause as now he be jealous 
who be there 
I find my nature will return 
to her old course I feel a inclination 
to some repose welcome thou please slumber 
a while embrace i in thy leaden arm 
and charm my careful thought 
conduct i to my bed 

how do the prince how bear he his restraint 

why sir as all great spirit 
bear great and sudden change with such impatience 
as a numidian lion when first catch 
endure the toil that hold he 
he will think of nothing 
but present death and seek all violent mean 
to compass it but time have mitigate 
those furious heat he now return to food 
and sleep admit the conversation 
of those that be about he 

I will I have not 
so easy believe my fear I be too sudden 
I will it be undo 

if you lament it 
that which now look like justice will be think 
a inconsiderate rashness 

but there be in nature 
such strong return that I punish he 
I do not grieve but that he be my son 

but it concern you to bear up your passion 
and make it good for if the people know 
that you have cause to grieve for what be do 
they will think you have no cause at first to do it 

go visit he from i and teach he patience 
since neither all his fury nor my sorrow 
can help what be past tell he my severity 
to he shall in some measure be requite 
by my indulgence to his child and if he desire it 
let they have access to he endeavour to take off 
his thought from revenge by tell he of 
paradise and I know not what pleasure 
in the other world 

I shall sir 

Mirvan the king relent and now there be leave 
no refuge but the last he must be poison 
and sudden lest he survive his father 

but handsome lest it appear 

appear 
to who you know there be none about he 
but such as I have place and they shall say 
it be discontent or abstinence 

but at the best 
it will be suspect 

why though it be know 
we will say he poison himself 

but the curious will pry further 
than bare report and the old king suspicion 
have pierce eye 

but those nature 
will short close you see his old disease 
grow strong upon he 

but if he shall recover 

but I have cast his nativity he can he must not 
in the mean time I have so besiege he 
so block up all the passage and place 
so many sentinel and guard upon he 
that no intelligence can be convey 
but by my instrument but this business will require 
more head and hand then we go you to the prison 
and bring the keeper private to i 
to give he his instruction 

sir I be command by the king 
to visit you 

what to give a period to my life 
and to his fear you be welcome here be a throat 
a heart or any other part ready to let 
in death and receive his command 

my lord I be no messenger nor minister of death 
it be not my function 

I shall know that voice 

I be the caliph and be come to tell you your father 
be now return to himself nature have get 
the victory over passion all his rigour 
be turn to grief and pity 

alas good man 
I pity he and his infirmity 
his doubt and fear and accident of age 
which first provoke his cruelty 

he bid i tell you 
his love to you shall ample recompense 
his cruelty to you and I dare say it be real 
for all his thought his pleasure and delight 
be fix on Fatyma when he be sad 
she comfort he when sick she be his physician 
and be it not for the delight he take 
in she I think he will die with sorrow 

but how be his affection fix so strange 
on her alone sure it be not in his nature 
for then he have love i or hate she 
because she come from i 

it be her desert 
she be fair beyond comparison and witty 
above her age and bear a manly spirit 
above her sex 

but may not I admire she 
be that too great a happiness pray let she make it 
her next suit to be permit to visit i herself 

she shall sir I joy to see your mind 
so well compose I fear I shall have find 
a tempest in your soul and come to lay it 
I will to the king 
I know to he that news will be 
most acceptable 

pray do and tell he 
I have cast off all my passion and be now 
a man again fit for society 
and conversation 

I will sir 

I never know myself till now how on the sudden 
I be grow a excellent dissembler to outdo 
one at the first that have practise it all his life 
so now I be myself again what be it 
I feel within methinks some vast design 
now take possession of my heart and swell 
my labour thought above the common bound 
of humane action something full of horror 
my soul have now decree my heart do beat 
as if it be forge thunderbolt for Jove 
to strike the tyrant dead so now I have it 
I have it it be a gallant mischief 
worthy my father or my father son 
all his delight vbz in Fatyma poor innocent 
but not more innocent than I and yet 
my father love thou and that be crime enough 
by this act old tyrant 
I shall be quit with thou while I be virtuous 
I be a stranger to thy blood but now 
sure thou will love i for this horrid crime 
it be so like thy own in this I be sure 
although in nothing else I be thy son 
but when it be do I leave he yet that remedy 
I take myself revenge but I aswell 
will rob he of his anger as his joy 
and have send she to the shade 
I will follow she 
but to return again and dwell 
in his dire thought for there be the black hell 

sir your wife the princess be come to visit you 

conduct she in now to my disguise again 

be this my lord the prince 

that be Erythaea 
or some angel voice like she it be she my struggle soul 
will fain go out to meet and welcome she Erythaea 
no answer but in sigh dear Erythaea 
thou come to comfort to support my suffering 
not to oppress i with a great weight 
to see that my unhappiness 
involve thou too 

my lord in all your triumph and your glory 
you call i into all your joy and give i 
a equal share and in this depth of misery 
can I be unconcern you needs must know 
you needs must hope I can or which be worse 
you must suspect my love for what be love 
but sympathy and this I make my happiness 
since both can be happy 
that we can both be miserable 

I prithee do not say thou love i 
for love or find out equal or make they so 
but I be so cast down and fall so low 
I can rise to thou and dare not wish 
thou shall descend to i but call it pity 
and I will own it then that king may give 
to beggar and not lessen their own greatness 

till now I think virtue have stand above 
the reach of fortune but if virtue be not 
yet love a great deity whatever fortune 
can give or take love want not or despise 
or by his own omnipotence supply 
then like a god with joy behold 
the beauty of his own creation 
thus what we form and image to our fancy 
we real possess 

but can thy imagination 
delude itself to fix upon a object 
so lose in misery so old in sorrow 
paleness and death hang on my cheek and darkness 
dwell in my eye more change from what I be 
in person then in fortune 

yet still the same to i 
alas my lord these outward beauty be but the prop and scaffold 
on which we build our love which now make perfect 
stand without those support nor be my flame 
so earthy as to need the dull material fuel 
of eye or lip or cheek still to be kindle 
and blow by appetite or else to expire 
my fire be pure and like those of heaven 
feed only and content with themselves 
need nothing from without 

but the disgrace that wait upon misfortune 
the mere reproach the shame of be miserable 
expose man to scorn and base contempt 
even from their near friend 

love be so far from scorn misery 
that he delight in it and be so kind cruel 
sometime to wish it that he may be alone 
in stead of all of fortune honour friend which be 
but mere diversion from love proper object 
which only be itself 

thou have almost 
teach i to love my misery and forgive 
all my misfortune I will at least forget they 
we will receive those time and in our memory 
preserve and still keep fresh like flower in water 
those happy day when at our eye our soul 
kindle their mutual fire their equal beam 
shoot and return till link and twine in one 
they chain our heart together 

And be it just that fortune shall begin 
her tyranny where we begin our love 
no if it have why be not I blind too 
I be sure if weep can have do it I have be 

think not that I be blind but think it night 
a season for our love and which to lover 
never seem too long and think of all our misery 
but as some melancholy dream which have awake we 
to the renew of our joy 

my lord this be a temper 
worthy the old philosopher 

ay but repeat that lesson 
which I have learn from thou all this morality 
thy love have teach i 

my lord you wrong your virtue 
to ascribe the effect of that to any cause 
less noble than itself 

and you your love 
to think it be less noble or less powerful 
than any the best virtue but I fear thy love 
will wrong itself so long a stay will make 
the jealous king suspect we have be plot 
how do the pledge of our former love 
our child 

both happy in their grandsire love especial 
the pretty Fatyma yet she 
accord to her apprehension feel 
a sense of your misfortune 

but let she not too much express it 
lest she provoke his fury 

she only can allay it 
when it be provoke she 
play with his rage and get above his anger 
as you have see a little boat 
to mount and dance upon the wave that threaten 
to overwhelm it 

to threaten be to save but his anger 
strike we like thunder where the blow outfly 
the loud report and even prevent man fear 

but then like thunder 
it rend a cedar or a oak or find 
some strong resist matter woman and child 
be not subject worthy a prince anger 

whatsoever 
be worthy of their love be worth their anger 

Love a more natural motion they be angry 
as prince but love as man 

once more I beg 
make not thy love thy danger 

my lord I see with what unwillingness 
you lie upon i this command and through your fare 
discern your love and therefore must obey you 

farewell my dear Erythaea 
there be a strange music in her voice the story 
of Orpheus which appear so bold a fiction 
be prophesy of thou thy voice have tame 
the tiger and the lion of my soul 

sir your daughter Fatyma 

conduct she in how strange be I tempt 
with opportunity which like a sudden gust 
have swell my calm thought into a tempest 
accurse opportunity 
the midwife and the bawd to all our vice 
that work our thought into desire desire 
to resolution those be ripe and quicken 
thou give they birth and bring they forth to action 

leave we o opportunity 
that when my dire and bloody resolution 
like sick and froward child 
be rock asleep by reason or religion 
thou like a violent noise come rush in 
and make they wake and start to new unquietness 
Come hither pretty Fatyma 
thy grandsire darling sit upon my knee 
he love thou dear 

I father for your sake 

and for his sake I shall requite it 
o virtue virtue 
where be thou flee thou be my reason friend 
but that like a depose prince have yield 
his sceptre to his base usurp vassal 
and like a traitor to himself take pleasure 
in serve they 

but father 
I desire he that you may have liberty and that 
he will give you your eye again 

pretty innocent 
it be not in the art nor power of man to do it 

must you never see again then father 

no not without a miracle 

why father I can see with one eye pray take one 
of i 

I will her innocent prate can overcome i 
oh what a conflict do I feel how be I 
toss like a ship betwixt two encounter tide 
love that be banish hence will fain return 
and force a entrance but revenge 
that be now the porter of my soul be deaf 
deaf as the adder and as full of poison 
mighty revenge that single canst overthrow 
all those joint power which nature virtue honour 
can raise against thou 

what do you seek for your handkerchief pray use i 
to drink the bloody moisture from your eye 
I will show it my grandfather 
I know it will make he weep 
why do you shake father 
just so my grandsire tremble at the instant 
your sight be take away 

and upon the like occasion 

o father what mean the naked knife 

it be to requite thy grandsire love prepare 
to meet thy death 

o it be I it be I 
your daughter Fatyma 

I therefore do it 

Alas be this the blessing my mother send i to receive 

thy mother Erythaea there be something in that 
that shake my resolution 
poor Erythaea how wretched shall I make thou 
to rob thou of a husband and a child 
but which be worse that first I fool and win thou 
to a belief that all be well and yet 
shall I forbear a crime for love of thou 
and not for love of virtue but what be virtue 
a mere imaginary sound a thing 
of speculation which to my dark soul 
deprive of reason be as indiscernible 
as colour to my body want sight 
then be leave to sense I must be guide 
by something that my sense grasp and take hold of 
on then my love and fear not to encounter 
that giant my revenge alas poor Fatyma 
my father love thou so do Erythaea 
whether shall I by just plague 
he who I hate be more unjust cruel 
to she I love or be kind to she 
be cruel to myself and leave unsatisfied 
my anger and revenge but love thou be 
the noble passion and to thou I sacrifice 
all my ungentle thought Fatyma forgive i 
and seal it with a kiss what be it I feel 
the spirit of revenge reinforcing 
new argument fly Fatyma 
fly while thou may nor tempt i to new mischief 
by give mean to act it to this ill 
my will lead not my power but power my will 
o what a tempest have I escape thanks to heaven 
and erythaea love 
no it be a poor a low revenge unworthy 
my virtue or my injury and 
as now my fame so then my infamy 
will blot out his and I instead of his empire 
shall only be the heir of all his curse 
no I will be still myself and carry with i 
my innocence to the other world and leave 
my fame to this it will be a brave revenge 
to raise my mind to a constancy so high 
that may look down upon his threat my patience 
shall mock his fury nor shall he be so happy 
to make i miserable and my suffering shall 
erect a proud trophy to my name 
than all my prosperous action every pilot 
can steer the ship in calm but he perform 
the skilful part can manage it in storm 

if happiness be a substantial good 
not frame of accident nor subject to they 
I err to seek it in a blind revenge 
or think it lose in loss of sight or empire 
it be something sure within we not subject 
to sense or sight only to be discern 
by reason my soul eye and that still see 
clear and clear for the want of these 
for gaze through these window of the body 
it meet such several such distract object 
but now confine within itself it see 
a strange and unknown world and there discover 
torrent of anger mountain of ambition 
gulf of desire and tower of hope huge giant 
monster and savage beast to vanquish these 
will be a brave conquest than the old 
or the new world 
o happiness of blindness now no beauty 
inflame my lust no other good my envy 
or misery my pity no man wealth 
draw my respect nor poverty my scorn 
yet still I see enough man to himself 
be a large prospect raise above the level 
of his low creep thought if then I have 
a world within myself that world shall be 
my empire there I will reign command free 
and willing obey secure from fear 
of foreign force or domestic treason 
and hold a monarchy more free more absolute 
than in my father seat and look down 
with scorn or pity on the slippery state 
of king will tread upon the neck of fate 

sir it be of near concernment and import 
no less than the king life and honour 

may not I know it 

you may sir but in his presence we be swear 
to impart it first to he 

Oure persian state descend not 
to interview with stranger but from whence 
come this discovery or you that bring it

Anatolia hear you nothing 
of two villain that late flee from hence

the same 

they be near than you think for 

where 

in Persia 

in arm again to tempt another slavery 
no sir they make some weak attempt presume on 
the reputation of their former greatness 
but have lose their fame and fortune 
it be no wonder they lose their friend now hopeless and forlorn 
they be return and somewhere live obscure 
to expect a change in Persia nor will be hard 
to find they 

do it and name your own reward 

we dare do nothing till we have see the king 
and than you shall command we 

well though it be not usual 
you shall have free access 

sir there be two turkish prisoner late flee 
from hence for a suppose conspiracy 
between the prince and they 

where be the villain 

this be the villain sir 
and we the wrongful accuse you give life sir 
and we take it 
as a free noble gift but when we hear 
it be value at the price of your son honour 
we come to give it back as a poor trifle 
prize at a rate too high 

Haly 
I can think my favour place so ill 
to be so ill requite yet their confidence 
have something in it that look like innocence 

be it come to that then to my last and sure refuge 

sure if the guilt be they they can not charge thou 
with such a gallant boldness if it be thou 
thou can not hear it with such a silent scorn 
I be amaze

they have truth to make they bold 
and I have power to scorn it it be I sir 
that betray he and you and they 

be this impudence or madness

a guard there 

seize he 

seize they now 
though it be too late to learn yet know 
against you be king again what it be to let your subject 
dispose all office of trust and power 
the beast obey his keeper and look up 
not to his master but his feeder hand 
and when you give i power to dispense 
and make your favour i in the same hour 
you make yourself my shadow and it be my courtesy 
to let you live and reign so long 

without there 
what none but traitor have this villain 
breathe treason into all and with that breath 
like a contagious vapour blast loyalty 
sure hell itself have send forth all her fury 
to inhabit and possess this place

like sea against a rock but lose their fury 
Mirvan take these villain and see they strangle 

farewell sir commend we to your son let he know 
that since we can die his servant 
we will die his martyr 

farewell unhappy friend 
a long farewell and may you find reward 
great as your innocence or which be more 
great as your wrong 

Come thou be trouble 
thou do not fear to die 

no but to lose my death 
to sell my life so cheap while this proud villain 
that take it must survive 

we shall not lose our death 
if heaven can hear the cry of guiltless blood 
which sure it must for I have hear the be loud one 
vengeance shall overtake thou 

away with they 

stay Haly they be innocent yet life when it be thy gift 
be worse than death I disdain to ask it 

and we to take it 

do not ask it sir 
for they to who you owe your ruin they have undo you 
have not they tell you this you have live secure 
and happy in your ignorance but this injury 
since it be not in your nature to forgive it 
I must not leave it in your power to punish it

be thou my judge and witness from this villain 
it be undeserved 
have I but feel your vengeance from some hand 
that first have suffer i it have be justice 
but have you send this sad return of all 
my love my trust my favour 

sir there be a great resemblance 
between your favour and my injury 
those be too great to be requite these 
too great to be forgive and therefore 
it be but in vain to mention either 

Mirza Mirza 
how be thou lose by my deceive credulity 
I will beg thy pardon 

stay sir not without my leave 
go some of you and let the people know 
the king keep state and will not come in public 
if any great affair or state address 
bring they to i 

how have I teach the villain 
to act my part but o my son my son 
shall I not see thou 

for once you shall sir 
but you must grant i one thing 

traitor do thou mock my misery 
what can I give but this unhappy life 

Alas sir it be but that I ask and it be my modesty 
to ask it it be in my power to take it 
when you shall see he sir to die for pity 
it be such a thing it will so deceive the world 
and make the people think you be good nature 
it will look so well in story and become 
the stage so handsome 

I never deny thou any thing and shall not now 
deny thou this though I can stand upright 
under the tyranny of age and fortune 
yet the sad weight of such ingratitude 
will crush i into earth 

lose not your tear but keep 
your lamentation for your son or sin 
for both deserve they but you must make haste sir 
or he will not stay your come 
it be now about the hour the poison 
must take effect 

poison o heaven 

nay sir lose no time in wonder both of we 
have much to do if you will see your son 
here be one shall bring you to he 
some unskilful pilot have shipwrack here 
but I not only against sure 
and likely ill have make myself secure 
but so confirm and fortify my state 
to set it safe above the reach of fate 

sir the princess and your son 

Soffy thou come to wonder at 
thy wretched father why do thou interrupt 
thy happiness by look on a object 
so miserable 

my lord methinks there be not in your voice 
the vigour that be wont nor in your look 
the wont cheerfulness be you well my lord 

no but I shall be I feel my health a come 

what be your disease my lord 

Nothing but I have take a cordial 
send by the king or Haly in requital 
of all my misery to make i happy 
the pillar of this frame grow weak 
as if the weight of many year oppress they 
my sinew slacken and a icy stiffness 
benumb my blood 

Alas I fear he be poison 
call all the help that art or herb or mineral 
can minister 

no it be too late 
and they that give i this be too well practise 
in such a art to attempt and not perform 

yet try my lord revive your thought the empire 
expect you your father die 

so when the ship be sink 
the wind that wrack it cease 

will you be the scorn of fortune 
to come near a crown and only near it 

I be not fortune scorn but she be i 
more blind than I 

o tyranny of fate to bring 
death in one hand and empire in the other 
only to show we happiness and then 
to snatch we from it 

they snatch i to it 
my soul be on her journey do not now 
divert or lead she back to lose herself 
in the maze and wind labyrinth on the world 
I prithee do not weep thy love be that 
I part with most unwilling or otherwise 
I have not stay till rude necessity 
have force i hence 
Soffy be not a man too soon 
and when thou be take heed of too much virtue 
it be thy father and his only crime 
it will make the king suspicious yet ere time 
by nature course have ripen thou to man 
it will mellow he to dust till then forget 
I be thy father yet forget it not 
my great example shall excite thy thought 
to noble action and you dear Erythaea 
give not your passion vent nor let blind fury 
precipitate your thought nor set they work 
till time shall lend they better mean and instrument 
than lose complaint where be pretty Fatyma 
she must forgive my rash ungentle passion 

what do you mean sir 

I be ashamed to tell you 
I prithee call she 

I will sir I pray try 
if sleep will ease your torment and repair 
your waste spirit 

sleep to these empty lid 
be grow a stranger and the day and night 
as undistinguished by my sleep as sight 
o happiness of poverty that rest 
secure on a bed of live turf 
while we with wake care and restless thought 
lie tumble on our down court the blessing 
of a short minute slumber which the ploughman 
shake from he as a ransom slave his fetter 
call in some music I have hear soft air 
can charm our sense and expel our care 
be Erythaea go 

yes sir 

it be well 
I will not have she present at my death 
somnus the humble God that dwell 
in cottage and smoky cell 
hate gild roof and bed of down 
and though he fear no prince frown 
fly from the circle of a crown 
Come I say thou powerful God 
and thy leaden charm rod 
dip in the lethaean lake 
over his wakeful temple shake 
lest he shall sleep and never wake 
nature alas why be thou so 
oblige to thy great foe 
sleep that be thy best repast 
yet of death it bear a taste 
and both be the same thing at last 

so now he sleep let we leave he 
to his repose 

the horror of this place present 
the horror of my crime I fain will ask 
what I be loath to hear but I be well prepare 
they that be past all hope of good be past 
all fear of ill and yet if he be dead 
speak soft or uncertain 

sir he sleep 

o that be too plain I know thou mean his last 
his long his endless sleep 

no sir he live but yet 
I fear the sleep you speak of will be his next 
for nature like a weak and weary traveller 
tire with a tedious and a rugged way 
not by desire provoke but even betray 
by weariness and want of spirit 
give up herself to this unwilling slumber 

thou have it Haly it be indeed a sad 
and sober truth though the first 
and only truth thou ever told i 
and it be a fatal sign when king hear truth 
especial when flatterer dare speak it 

I think I hear my father do he think the poison 
too slow and come to see the operation 
or do he think his engine dull or honest 
less apt to execute than he to bid he 
he need not it be enough it will succeed 
to his expectation 

it be indeed thy father 
thy wretched father but so far from act 
new cruelty that if those already past 
acknowledge and repent of can yet 
receive a pardon by those mutual bond 
nature have seal between we which though I 
have cancel thou have still preserve inviolate 
I beg thy pardon 

death in itself appear 
lovely and sweet not only to be pardon 
but wish for have it come from any other hand 
but from a father a father 
a name so full of life of love of pity 
death from a father hand from who I first 
receive a being it be a preposterous gift 
a act at which invert nature start 
and blush to behold herself so cruel 

take thou that comfort with thou and be not deaf to truth 
by all that be holy by the die accent 
of thou and my last breath I never mean 
I never wish it sorrow have so overfraught 
this sink bark I shall not live to show 
how I abhor or how I will repent 
my first rash crime but he that now 
have poison thou first poison i with jealousy 
a foolish causeless jealousy 

since you believe my innocence 
I can but believe your sorrow 
but do the villain live a just revenge 
will more become the sorrow of a king 
than womanish complaint 

o Mirza Mirza 
I have no more the power to do it 
than thou to see it do my empire Mirza 
my empire be lose thy virtue be the rock 
on which it firm stand that be undermine 
it sink with its own weight the villain who my breath create 
now brave it in my throne 

o for a hour of life but it will not be 
revenge and justice we must leave to heaven 
I will say more but death have take in the outwork 
and now assail the fort I feel I feel he 
gnaw my heartstring farewell and yet I will 

o stay stay but a while and take i with thou 
come death let i embrace thou thou that be 
the worst of all my fear be now the best 
of all my hope but fate why have thou add 
this curse to all the rest the love of life 
we love it and yet hate it death we loathe 
and still desire fly to it and yet fear it 

he be go he be go for ever 
oh that the poison have mistake his 
and meet this hate life but cruel fate 
envy so great a happiness fate that still 
fly from the wretched and pursue the bless 
you heaven but why shall I complain to they 
that hear i not or bow to those that hate i 
why shall your curse so outweigh your blessing 
they come but single and long expectation 
take from their value but these fall upon we 
double and sudden 
yet more of horror than farewell my tear 
and my just anger be no more confine 
to vain complaint or selfdevouring silence 
but break break forth upon he like a deluge 
and the great spirit of my injure lord 
possess i and inspire i with a rage 
great as thy wrong and let i call together 
all my soul power to throw a curse upon he 
black as his crime 

o spare your anger it be lose 
for he who thou accuse have already 
condemn himself and be as miserable 
as thou can think or wish he spit upon i 
cast all reproach on i woman wit 
or malice can invent I will thank thou for they 
whatever can give i a more lively sense 
of my own crime that so I may repent they 

o cruel tyrant can thou be so barbarous 
to a son as noble as thyself be vile 
that know no other crime but too much virtue 
nor can deserve so great a punishment 
for any fault but that he be thy son 
now not content to exceed all other tyrant 
exceed thyself first rob he of sight 
then seem by a feign and force repentance 
to expiate that crime do win he to 
a false security and now by poison 
have rob he of his life 

Were but my soul as pure 
from other guilt as that heaven do not hold 
one more immaculate yet what I have do 
he die do forgive i and have thou be present 
thou will have do the same for thou be happy 
compare to i I be not only miserable 
but wicked too thy misery may find 
pity and help from other but my make i 
the scorn and the reproach of all the world 
thou like unhappy merchant who adventure 
be dash on rock or swallow up in storm 
owe all thy loss to the fate but I 
like wasteful prodigal have cast away 
my happiness and with it all man pity 
thou see how weak and wretched guilt can make 
even king themselves when a weak woman anger 
can master i 

and your sorrow 
as much oh overcome my anger and turn into melt pity 

pity not i nor yet deplore your husband 
but seek the safety of your son his innocence 
will be too weak a guard when nor my greatness 
nor yet his father virtue can protect we 
go on my boy the just revenge of all 
Oure wrong I recommend to thou and heaven 
I feel my weakness grow strong upon i 
death thou be he that will not flatter prince 
that stoop not to authority nor give 
a specious name to tyranny but show 
our action in their own deform likeness 
now all those cruelty which I have act 
to make i great or glorious or secure 
look like the hate crime of other man 

o save save i who be those that stand 
and seem to threaten i 

there be nobody it be nothing 
but some fearful dream 

yes that be my brother ghost who birthright stand 
betwixt i and empire like a spread cedar 
that grow to hinder some delightful prospect 
he I cut down 
next my old father ghost who I impatient 
to have my hope delay hasten by violence before his fatal day 
then my enrage son who seem to beckon 
and hale i to he I come I come you ghost 
the great of you all but sure one hell be 
too little to contain i and too narrow 
for all my crime 

go muster all the citieband pretend it 
to prevent sudden tumult 
but indeed to settle the succession 

my lord you be too sudden you will take they unprepared 
alas you know their conscience be tender 
scandal and scruple must be first remove 
they must be pray and preach into a tumult 
but for the succession 
let we agree on that there be Calamah 
the elder son by the arabian lady 
a gallant youth 

ay too gallant his proud spirit will disdain 
to owe his greatness to another gift 
such gift as crown transcend all requital 
turn injury 
no Mirvan he must be dull and stupid lest he know 
wherefore we make he king 

but he must be good nature tractable 
and one that will be govern 

and have so much wit to know who he be behold to 

but why my lord shall you look further than yourself 

I have have some such thought but I consider 
the persian state will not endure a king 
so mean bear no I will rather be the same I be 
in place the second but the first in power 
Solyman the son of the georgian lady 
shall be the man what noise be that 

my lord the prince late victorious army 
be march towards the palace breathe nothing 
but fury and revenge to they be join 
all who desire of change or discontent 
excite to new attempt their leader 
abdall and Morat 

Abdall and Morat Mirvan we be lose fall from the top 
of all our hope and cast away like sailor 
who escape sea and rock and tempest perish 
in the very port so be we lose in the sight 
and reach of all our wish 

How have our intelligence fail we so strange 

no no I know they be in mutiny 
but they can never have hurt we 
have they not come at this instant period 
this point of time have he live two day long 
a pardon to the captain and a largesse 
among the soldier have appease their fury 
have he die two day soon the succession 
have as we please be settle and secure 
by soffy death god that the world shall turn 
on minute and on moment 

my lord lose not yourself 
in passion but take counsel from necessity 
I will to they and will let they know 
the prince be dead and that they come too late 
to give he liberty for love to he 
have breed their discontent I will tell they bold 
that they have lose their hope 

and tell they too 
as they have lose their hope of the one they have lose 
their fear of the other tell their leader we desire 
their counsel in the next succession 
which if it meet disturbance 
than we shall crave assistance from their power 
which fate can not have send in a more happy hour 

my lord 
you hear the news the prince army be at the gate 

ay I hear it and feel it here 
but the succession that be the point 
that first require your counsel 

who shall succeed but Soffy 

what in such time as these when such a army 
lie at our gate to choose a child our king 
you my lord Caliph be better read in story 
and can discourse the fatal consequence 
when child reign 

my lord if you will be guide 
by reason and example 

my lord you come most opportune we be enter 
into dispute about the next succession 

who dare dispute it we have a powerful argument 
of forty thousand strong that shall confute he 

a powerful argument indeed 

ay such a one as will puzzle all your logic 
and distinction to answer it 
and since we come too late for the performance 
of our intend service to the prince 
the wrong prince we can more express 
our loyalty to he than in the right 
of his most hopeful son 

but be he not too young 

sure you think we so too but he and we 
be old enough to look through your disguise 
and under that to see his father enemy 

seize he and you that can show reason or example 

seize i for what 

can thou remember such a name as Mirza 
and ask for what 

that name I must remember and with horror 
but few have die for do 
what they have die for if they have not do 
it be the king command and I be only 
the unhappy minister 

ay such a minister as wind to fire 
that add a accidental fierceness to 
its natural fury 

if it be the king command it be first thy malice 
command that command and then obey it 

nay if you have resolve it truth and reason 
be weak and idle argument 
but let i pity the unhappy instrument 
of prince will who anger be our fate 
and yet their love more fatal than their hate 

and how well that love have be requite 
Mirvan your confident 
by torture have confess 

the story of the king and of the pasha 

Mirvan poorspirited wretch thou have deceive i 
nay then farewell my hope and next my fear 

what horrid noise be that of drum and 
trumpet that strike my ear 
what mean these bond can not my grandsire jealousy 
be satisfy upon his son but now 
must seize his dear favourite sure my turn come next 

it be come already sir but to succeed he not they 
long live king Soffy 

but why be these man prisoner 

let this inform you 

but be my grandsire dead 

as sure as we be alive 

then let they still be prisoner away with they 
invite our mother from her sad retirement 
and all that suffer for my father love 
restraint or punishment 

dear mother make 
our happiness complete by break through 
that cloud of sorrow 
and let we not be want to ourselves 
now the heaven have do their part 
lest so severe and obstinate a sadness 
tempt a new vengeance 

sir to comply with you I will use a violence 
upon my nature joy be such a foreigner 
so mere a stranger to my thought I know 
not how to entertain he but sorrow 
ill make by custom so habitual 
it be now part of my nature 

but can no pleasure no delight divert it 
greatness or power which woman most affect 
if that can do it rule i and rule my empire 

sir seek not to rob i of my tear fortune 
herself be not so cruel for my counsel 
then may be unsuccessful but my prayer 
shall wait on all your action 

alas poor Solyman how be he alter 

I know not sir it a art your grandfather have to make 
i grow I think he take i for some crooked lady 
I be sure the engine be better for the purpose than 
steel body or bolster 

but for what cause be all this cruelty 

why because I will not accuse your father when he 
see he can not stretch my conscience thus he have 
stretch my carcase 

I think they have stretch his wit too 

this be your father love that lie thus in my joint 
I may have love all the pocky whore in Persia and 
have feel it less in my bone 

thy faith and honesty shall be reward 
accord to thy own desire 

friend I pray thou tell i whereabout my knee be 
I will fain kneel to thank his majesty 
why sir for the present my desire be only to have 
a good bonesetter and when your majesty have do the office 
of a bonesetter to the body politic and some skilful 
man to this body of i which if it have be a body 
politic have never come to this I shall by that 
time think on something accord to my desert 
but must none of these great one be hang for 
their villainy 

yes certain 

then I need look no further some of their place 
will serve my turn 

bring back those villain 

now to your tear dear madam and the ghost 
of my dead father will I consecrate 
the first fruit of my justice let such honour 
and funeral rite as to his birth and virtue 
be due be first perform than all that be 
actor or author of so black a deed 
be sacrifice as victim to his ghost 
first thou my holy devil that can varnish 
so foul a act with the fair name of piety 
next thou the abuser of thy prince ear 

sir I beg your mercy 

and I a speedy death nor shall my resolution 
disarm itself nor condescend to parley 
with foolish hope 

it be cruelty to spare they I be sorry 
I must commence my reign in blood but duty 
and justice to my father soul exact 
this cruel piety let we study for a punishment 
a feel one 
and borrow from our sorrow so much time 
to invent a torment equal to their crime
