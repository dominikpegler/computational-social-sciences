I will not for half Savoy but have bind 
France to some favour by my personal presence 
more than yourself my lord ambassador 
can have obtain for all ambassador 
you know have chief these instruction 
to note the state and chief sway of the court 
to which they be employ to penetrate 
the heart and marrow of the king design 
and to observe the countenance and spirit 
of such as be impatient of rest 
and wring beneath some private discontent 
but past all these there be a number more 
of these state criticism that our personal view 
may profitable make which can fall 
within the power of our instruction 
to make you comprehend I will do more 
with my mere shadow than you with your person 
all you can say against my come here 
be that which I confess may for the time 
breed strange affection in my brother Spain 
but when I shall have time to make my cannon 
the longtonged herald of my hide drift 
our reconcilement will be make with triumph 

if not your highness have small cause to care 
have such worthy reason to complain 
of Spain cold friendship and his linger succour 
who only entertain your grief with hope 
to make your medicine desperate 

my lord know 
the spanish gloss too well his form stuffe'lasting 
and the most dangerous condition 
he lay on they with who he be in league 
the injustice in the most unequal dowry 
give with the infanta who my lord espouse 
compare with that her elder sister have 
may tell he how much Spain love weigh to he 
when of so many globe and sceptre hold 
by the great king he only will bestow 
a portion but of six score thousand crown 
in yearly pension with his highness wife 
when the infanta wed by the archduke 
have the French county and low province 

we shall not set these passage of spleen 
betwixt Spain and Savoy to the weak part 
more good by sufferance grow than deed of heart 
the near prince be the further off 
in rite of friendship my advice have never 
consent to this voyage of my lord 
in which he do endanger Spain whole loss 
for hope of some poor fragment here in France 

my hope in France you know not though my counsel 
and for my loss of Spain it be agree 
that I shall sleight it ofttimes prince rule 
be like the chemical philosopher 
leave i then to my own projection 
in this our thrifty alchemy of state 
yet help i thus far you that have be here 
our lord ambassador and in short inform i 
what spirit here be fit for our design 

the newcreated duke Byron be fit 
be there no other reason for your presence 
to make it worthy for he be a man 
of matchless valour and be ever happy 
in all encounter which be still make good 
with a unwearied sense of any toil 
have continue fourteen day together 
upon his horse his blood be not voluptuous 
nor much incline to woman his desire 
be high than his state and his desert 
not much short of the most he can desire 
if they be weigh with what France feel by they 
he be past measure glorious and that humour 
be fit to feed his spirit who it possess 
with faith in any error chief where 
man blow it up with praise of his perfection 
the taste whereof in he so soothe his palate 
and take up all his appetite that oft time 
he will refuse his meat and company 
to feast alone with their most strong conceit 
ambition also cheek by cheek do march 
with that excess of glory both sustain 
with a unlimited fancy that the king 
nor France itself without he can subsist 

he be the man my lord I come to win 
and that supreme intention of my presence 
see never light till now which yet I fear 
the politic king suspect be the cause 
that he have send he so far from my reach 
and make he chief in the commission 
of his ambassage to my brother archduke 
with who he be now and as I be tell 
so entertain and fit in his humour 
that ere I part I hope he will return 
prepare and make the more fit for the physic 
that I intend to minister 

my lord 
there be another discontent spirit 
now here in court that for his brain and aptness 
to any course that may recover he 
in his decline and litigious state 
will serve Byron as he be make for he 
in give vent to his ambitious vain 
and that be de Laffin 

you tell i true 
and he I think you have prepare for i 

I have my lord and doubt not he will prove 
of the yet taintless fortress of Byron 
a quick expugner and a strong abider 

perhaps the battery will be bring before he 
in this ambassage for I be assure 
they set high price of he and be inform 
of all the passage and mean for mine 
that may be think on to his take in 
the king come and Laffin the king aspect 
fold in cloud 

I will not have my train 
make a retreat for bankrupt nor my court 
a hive for drone proud beggar and true thief 
that with a force truth they swear to i 
rob my poor subject shall give up their art 
and henceforth learn to live by their desert 
though I be grow by right of birth and arm 
into a great kingdom I will spread 
with no more shade then may admit that kingdom 
her proper natural and wont fruit 
Navarre shall be Navarre and France still France 
if one may be the better for the other 
by mutual rite so neither shall be worse 
thou be in law in quarrel and in debt 
which thou will quit with countenance borrow 
with thou be purchase and thou seek by i 
in my supportance now our old war cease 
to wage worse battle with the arm of peace 

peace must not make man cowherd nor keep calm 
her pursy regiment with man smother breath 
I must confess my fortune be decline 
but neither my deserve nor my mind 
I seek but to sustain the right I find 
when I be rich in keep what be leave 
and make good my honour as at best 
though it be hard man right to every thing 
wane with his wealth wealth be his sure king 
yet justice shall be still indifferent 
the overplus of king in all their might 
be but to piece out the defect of right 
and this I sue for nor shall frown and taunt 
the common scarecrow of all poor man suit 
nor misconstruction that do colour still 
licentiate justice punish good for ill 
keep my free throat from knock at the sky 
if thunder chide i for my equity 

thy equity be to be ever banish 
from court and all society of noblesse 
among who thou throw ball of all dissension 
thou be at peace with nothing but with war 
have no heart but to hurt and eat thy heart 
if it but think of do any good 
thou witch with thy smile suck blood with praise 
mock all humanity society poison 
cozen with virtue with religion 
betray and massacre so vile thyself 
that thou suspect perfection in other 
a man must think of all the villainy 
he know in all man to decipher thou 
that be the centre to impiety 
away and tempt i not 

but you tempt i 
to what thou sun be judge and make he see Exit 

now by my dear marquisate of Salusses 
your majesty have with the great life 
describe a wicked man or rather thrust 
your arm down through he to his very foot 
and pluck his inside out that ever yet 
my ear do witness or turn ear to eye 
and those strange character write in his face 
which at first sight be hard for i to read 
the doctrine of your speech have make so plain 
that I run through they like my natural language 
nor do I like that man aspect methinks 
of all look where the beam of star have carve 
their powerful influence and oh rare 
what a heroic more than royal spirit 
bewray you in your first speech that defy 
protection of vile drone that eat the honey 
sweat from laborious virtue and deny 
to give those of Navarre though breed with you 
the benefit and dignity of France 
when little river by their greedy currant 
far far extend from their mother spring 
drink up the foreign brook still as they run 
and force their greatness when they come to sea 
and justle with the ocean for a room 
oh how he roar and take they in his mouth 
digest they so to his proper stream 
that they be no more see he nothing raise 
above his usual bound yet they devour 
that of themselves be pleasant goodly flood 

I will do best for both yet shall not be secure 
till in some absolute heir my crown be settle 
there be so little now betwixt aspirer 
and their great object in my only self 
that all the strength they gather under i 
tempt combat with my own I therefore make 
mean for some issue by my marriage 
which with the great duke niece be now conclude 
and she be come I have trust in heaven 
I be not yet so old but I may spring 
and then I hope all traitorous hope will fade 

else may their whole estate fly root up 
to ignominy and oblivion 
and be your neighbour servant and poor kinsman 
I wish your mighty race may multiply 
even to the period of all empery 

thank to my princely cousin this your love 
and honour shew i in your personal presence 
I wish to welcome to your full content 
the peace I now make with your brother archduke 
by duke Byron our lord ambassador 
I wish may happy extend to you 
and that at his return we may conclude it 

it shall be to my heart the happy day 
of all my life and that life all employ 
to celebrate the honour of that day exeunt 

the wondrous honour do our duke Byron 
in his ambassage here in the archduke court 
I fear will taint his loyalty to our king 
I will observe how they observe his humour 
and glorify his valour and how he 
accept and stand attractive to their end 
that so I may not seem a idle spot 
in train of this ambassage but return 
able to give our king some note of all 
worth my attendance and see here be the man 
who though a french man and in Orleans bear 
serve the archduke I do most suspect 
be set to be the tempter of our duke 
I will go where I may see all though not hear 

spread here this history of Catiline 
that earth may seem to bring forth Roman spirit 
even to his genial foot and her dark breast 
be make the clear glass of his shine grace 
we will make his foot so tender they shall gall 
in all path but to empire and therein 
I will make the sweet step of his state begin Exit 

what place be this what air what region 
in which a man may hear the harmony 
of all thing move Hymen marry here 
their end and use and make i his temple 
have any man be bless and yet live 
the blood turn in my vein I stand on change 
and shall dissolve in change it be so full 
of pleasure not to be contain in flesh 
to fear a violent good abuse goodness 
it be immortality to die aspire 
as if a man be take quick to heaven 
what will not hold perfection let it burst 
what force have any cannon not be charge 
or be not discharge to have stuff and form 
and to lie idle fearful and unused 
nor form nor stuff show happy Semele 
that die compress with glory happiness 
deny comparison of less or more 
and not at most be nothing like the shaft 
shoot at the sun by angry Hercules 
and into shiver by the thunder break 
will I be if I burst and in my heart 
this shall be write yet it be high and right 
here too they follow all my step with music 
as if my foot be numerous and tread sound 
out of the centre with Apollo virtue 
that out of every thing his eachpart touch 
strike musical accent wheresoever I go 
they hide the earth from i with cover rich 
to make i think that I be here in heaven 

this way your highness 

come they 

I my lord exeunt 

my lord d' Aumerle I be exceed sorry 
that your own obstinacy to hold out 
your mortal enmity against the king 
when duke du main and all the faction yield 
shall force his wrath to use the rite of treason 
upon the member of your senseless statue 
your name and house when he have lose your person 
your love and duty 

that which man enforce 
by their own wilfulness they must endure 
with willing patience and without complaint 

I use not much impatience nor complaint 
though it offend i much to have my name 
so blot with addition of a traitor 
and my whole memory with such despite 
mark and begin to be so root out 

it be despite that hold you out so long 
who penance in the king be needful justice 

Come let we seek our duke and take our leaf 
of the archduke grace exeunt 

here may we safe breathe 

no doubt my lord no stranger know this way 
only the archduke and your friend count Mansfield 
perhaps may make their general escape to you 
to utter some part of their private love 
ere your departure 

then I well perceive 
to what the intention of his highness tend 
for who and other here most worthy lord 
I will become with all my worth their servant 
in any office but disloyalty 
but that have ever show so foul a monster 
to all my ancestor and my former life 
that now to entertain it I must whole 
give up my habit in his contrary 
and strive to grow out of privation 

my lord to wear your loyal habit still 
when it be out of fashion and have do 
service enough be rustic misery 
the habit of a servile loyalty 
be reckon now among privation 
with blindness dumbness deafness silence death 
all which be neither nature by themselves 
nor substance but mere decay of form 
and absolute decession of nature 
and so it be nothing what shall you then lose 
your highness have a habit in perfection 
and in desert of high dignity 
which carve yourself and be your own rewarder 
no true power do admit privation 
adverse to he or suffer any fellow 
join in his subject you superior 
it be the nature of thing absolute 
one to destroy another be your highness 
like those steep hill that will admit no cloud 
no dew nor lest fume bind about their brow 
because their top pierce into pure air 
expert of humour or like air itself 
that quick change and receive the sun 
soon as he rise everywhere disperse 
his royal splendour gird it in his beam 
and make itself the body of the light 
hot shine swift light and aspire thing 
be of immortal and celestial nature 
cold dark dull heavy of infernal fortune 
and never aim at any happiness 
your excellency know that simple loyalty 
faith love sincerity be but word no thing 
mere devise for form and as the legate 
send from his holiness to frame a peace 
betwixt Spain and Savoy labour fervent 
for common end not for the duke particular 
to have he sign it he again endeavour 
not for the legate pain but his own pleasure 
to gratify he and be at last encounter 
where the flood Tesyn enter into Po 
they make a kind contention which of they 
shall enter the other boat one thrust the other 
one leg be over and another in 
and with a fiery courtesy at last 
Savoy leap out into the legate arm 
and here end all his love and the other labour 
so shall these term and imposition 
express before hold nothing in themselves 
real good but flourish of form 
and further than they make to private end 
none wise or free their proper use intend 

o it be a dangerous and a dreadful thing 
to steal prey from a lion or to hide 
a head distrustful in his open jaw 
to trust our blood in other vein and hang 
betwixt heaven and earth in vapour of their breath 
to leave a sure pace on continuate earth 
and force a gate in jump from tower to tower 
as they do that aspire from height to height 
the bound of loyalty be make of glass 
soon break but can in no date be repair 
and as the duke D'Aumall now here in court 
fly his country have his statue tear 
piecemeal with horse all his good confiscate 
his arm of honour kick about the street 
his goodly house at annet raze to the earth 
and for a strange reproach of his foul treason 
his tree about it cut off by their waste 
so when man fly the natural clime of truth 
and turn themselves loose out of all the bound 
of justice and the straightway to their end 
forsake all the sure force in themselves 
to seek without they that which be not they 
the form of all their comfort be distract 
the riches of their freedom forfeit 
their human noblesse shame the mansion 
of their cold spirit eat down with care 
and all their ornament of wit and valour 
learning and judgement cut from all their fruit 

o here be now the rich prize in Europe 
be he but take in affection 
will we may grow together and be twin 
of either fortune or that still embrace 
I be but ring to such a precious stone 

your highness honour and high bounty show i 
have win from i my voluntary power 
and I must now move by your eminent will 
to what particular object if I know 
by this man intercession he shall bring 
my uttermost answer and perform betwixt we 
reciprocal and full intelligence 

Even for your own deserve royal good 
it be joyful accept use the love 
and worthy admiration of your friend 
that beget vow of all thing you can wish 
and be what I wish danger say no more Exit 

your highness make the light of this court stoop 
with your so near departure I be force 
to tender to your excellence in brief 
this private wish in take of my leave 
that in some army royal old count Mansfield 
may be command by your matchless valour 
to the supreme point of victory 
who vow for that renown all prayer and service 
no more lest I may wrong you Exit Mansf 

thank your lordship 

all majesty be add to your highness 
of which I will not wish your breast to bear 
more modest apprehension then may tread 
the high gate of your spirit and be know 
to be a fit bind for your boundless valour 

so Oreng wish and to the desert 
of your great action their most royal crown 

away my lord the lord inquire for you Exit Bir 

will we may win his valour to our part 

it be well prepare in his entreaty here 
with all state high observation 
and to their form and word be add gift 
he be present with two goodly horse 
one of which two be the brave beast Pastrana 
with plate of gold and a much prize jewel 
girdle and hanger set with wealthy stone 
all which be value at ten thousand crown 
the other lord have suit of tapestry 
and chain of gold and every gentleman 
a pair of spanish glove and rapier blade 
and here end their entreaty which I hope 
be the beginning of more good to we 
than twenty thousand time their gift to they 

my lord I grieve that all the set forth 
of our best welcome make you more retire 
your chamber have be more love than our honour 
and therefore we be glad your time of part 
be come to set you in the air you love 
commend my service to his majesty 
and tell he that this day of peace with he 
I will hold as holy all your pain my lord 
I shall be always glad to gratify 
with any love and honour your own heart 
shall do i grace to wish express to you 

here have be strange demeanour which shall fly 
to the great author of this embassy 

admit no entry I will speak with none 
good signior de Laffin your worth shall find 
that I will make a jewel for my cabinet 
of that the king in surfeit of his store 
have cast out as the sweep of his hall 
I tell he have threaten you away 
that I do wonder this small time of peace 
can make he cast his armour so secure 
in such as you and as it be set the head 
of one so great in counsel on his foot 
and pitch he from he with such guardlike strength 

he may perhaps find he have pitch away 
the axletree that keep he on his wheel 

I tell he so I swear in other term 
and not with too much note of our close love 
lest so he may have smoke our practise 

to choose his time and spit his poison on i 
through the ear and eye of stranger 

so I tell he 
and more than that which now I will not tell you 
it rest now then noble and worthy friend 
that to our friendship we draw duke Byron 
to who attraction there be no such chain 
as you can forge and shake out of your brain 

I have devise the fashion and the weight 
to valure hard to draw we use retreat 
and to pull shaft home with a good bowarm 
we thrust hard from we since he come from Flanders 
he hear how I be threaten with the king 
and have be much inquisitive to know 
the truth of all and seek to speak with i 
the mean he use I answer doubtful 
and with a intimation that I shun he 
which will I know put more spur to his charge 
and if his haughty stomach be prepare 
with will to any act for the aspire 
of his ambitious aim I make no doubt 
but I shall work he to your highness wish 

but undertake it and I rest assure 
you be report to have skill in magic 
and the event of thing at which they reach 
that be in nature apt to overreach 
who the whole circle of the present time 
in present pleasure fortune knowledge 
can not contain those man as break loose 
from human limit in all violent end 
will fain aspire the faculty of fiend 
and in such air breathe his unbounded spirit 
which therefore well will fit such conjuration 
attempt he then by fly close with he 
and bring he home to we and take my dukedom 

my best in that and all thing vow your service 

thank to my dear friend and the french Ulysses 

here be the man my honour friend Laffin 
alone and heavy countenance on what term 
stand the insultation of the king upon you 

why do you ask 

since I will know the truth 

and when you know it what 

I will judge betwixt you 
and as I may make even the excess of either 

ah alas my lord not all your loyalty 
which be in you more than hereditary 
nor all your valour which be more than humane 
can do the service you may hope on i 
in sound my displease integrity 
stand for the king as much in policy 
as you have stir for he in deed of arm 
and make yourself he glory and your country 
till you be suck as dry and wrought as leave 
as my stead carcase you shall never close 
with i as you imagine 

you much wrong i 
to think i a intelligence lord 

I know not now your so affect zeal 
to be repute a true heart subject 
may stretch or turn you I be desperate 
if I offend you I be in your power 
I care not how I tempt your conquer fury 
I be predestine to too base a end 
to have the honour of your wrath destroy i 
and be a worthy object for your sword 
I lay my hand and head too at your foot 
as I have ever here I hold it still 
end i direct do not go about 

how strange be this the shame of his disgrace 
have make he lunatic 

since the king have wrong i 
he think I will hurt myself no no my lord 
I know that all the king in Christendom 
if they shall join in my revenge will prove 
weak foe to he still have you to friend 
if you be go I care not if you tell he 
I may be tempt then to right myself Exit 

he have a will to i and dare not show it 
his state decay and he disgrace distract he 

change not my word my lord I only say 
I may be tempt then to right myself 
temptation to treason be no treason 
and that word tempt be conditional too 
if you be go I pray inform the truth exitur 

stay injure man and know I be your friend 
far from these base and mercenary reach 
I be I swear to you 

you may be so 
and yet you will give i leave to be Laffin 
a poor and expuate humour of the court 
but what good blood come out with i what vein 
and sinew of the triumph now it make 
I list not vaunt yet will I now confess 
and dare assume it I have power to add 
to all his greatness and make yet more fix 
his bold security tell he this my lord 
and this if all the spirit of earth and air 
be able to enforce I can make good 
if knowledge of the sure event of thing 
even from the rise of subject into king 
and fall of king to subject hold a power 
of strength to work it I can make it good 
and tell he this to if in midst of winter 
to make black grove grow green to still the thunder 
and cast out able flash from my eye 
to beat the lightning back into the sky 
prove power to do it I can make it good 
and tell he this too if to lift the sea 
up to the star when all the wind be still 
and keep it calm when they be most enrage 
to make earth dry palm sweat humorous spring 
to make fix rock walk and loose shadow stand 
to make the dead speak midnight see the sun 
midday turn midnight to dissolve all law 
of nature and of order argue power 
able to work all I can make all good 
and all this tell the king 

it be more than strange 
to see you stand thus at the rapier point 
with one so kind and sure a friend as I 

who can friend himself be foe to any 
and to be fear of all and that be it 
make i so scorn but make i what you can 
never so wicked and so full of fiend 
I never yet be traitor to my friend 
the law of friendship I have ever hold 
as my religion and for other law 
he be a fool that keep they with more care 
than they keep he safe rich and popular 
for riches and for popular respect 
take they among you minion but for safety 
you shall not find the least flaw in my arm 
to pierce or taint i what will great man be 
to please the king and bear authority Exit 

How fic a tort be this to handsel fortune 
and I will win it though I lose myself 
though he prove hard than egyptian marble 
I will make he malleable as the ophyr gold 
I be put off from this dull shore of east 
into industrious and highgoing sea 
where like Pelides in Scamander flood 
up to the ear in surge I will fight 
and pluck french Ilium underneath the wave 
if to be high still be to be best 
all work to that end be the worthy 
truth be a golden ball cast in our way 
to make we strip by falsehood and as Spain 
when the hot scuffle of barbarian arm 
smother the life of don Sebastian 
to guild the leaden rumor of his death 
give for a slaughter body hold for his 
a hundred thousand crown cause all the state 
of superstitious Portugal to mourn 
and celebrate his solemn funeral 
the moor to conquest thankful feast prefer 
and all make with the carcase of a Swisser 
so in the giant like and politic war 
of barbarous greatness rage still in peace 
show to aspire just object be lay on 
with cost with labour and with form enough 
which only make our best act brook the light 
and their end have we think we have their right 
so worst work be make good with good success 
and so for king pay subject carcase Exit 

be he so court 

as a city dame 
bring by her jealous husband to the court 
some elder courtier entertain he 
while other snatch a favour from his wife 
one start from this door from that nook another 
with gift and junket and with print phrase 
steal her employment shift place by place 
still as her husband come so duke Byron 
be wood and worship in the archduke court 
and as the assistant that your majesty 
join in commission with he or myself 
or any other doubt eye appear 
he ever vanish and as such a dame 
as we compare with he before be win 
to break faith to her husband lose her fame 
stain both their progeny and come fresh 
from underneath the burden of her shame 
visit her husband with as chaste a brow 
as temperate and confirm behaviour 
as she come quit from confession 
so from his escape will he present a presence 
the practice of his state adultery 
and guilt that shall a graceful bosom strike 
drown in the set lake of a hopeless cheek 

it may be he dissemble or suppose 
he be a little taint man who virtue 
form with the stuff of fortune great and gracious 
must needs partake with fortune in her humour 
of instability and be like to shaft 
grow crooked with stand which to rectify 
must twice as much be bow another way 
he that have bear wound for his worthy part 
must for his worst be bear with we must fit 
our government to man as man to it 
in old time they that hunt savage beast 
be say to clothe themselves in savage skin 
they that be fowler when they go on fowl 
wear garment make with wing resemble fowl 
to bull we must not show ourselves in red 
nor to the warlike elephant in white 
in all thing govern their infirmity 
must not be stir nor wrought on duke Byron 
flow with adust and melancholy choler 
and melancholy spirit be venomous 
not to be touch but as they may be cure 
I therefore mean to make he change the air 
and send he further from those spanish vapour 
that still bear fight sulphur in their breast 
to breathe a while in temperate english air 
where lip be spice with free and loyal counsel 
where policy be not rumour but save 
wisdom be simple valour righteous 
human and hate fact of brutish force 
and who grave nature scorn the scoff of France 
the empty compliment of Italy 
the anyway encroach pride of Spain 
and love man modest hearty just and plain 

I will sound he for Byron and what I find 
in the king depth I will draw up and inform 
in excitation to the duke revolt 
when next I meet with he 

it must be do 
with praise of the duke from who the king 
will take to give himself which tell the duke 
will take his heart up into all ambition 

I know it politic friend and it be my purpose exit Laf 
your majesty have miss a royal sight 
the duke Byron on his brave beast Pastrana 
who sit he like a fullsailed argosy 
dance with a lofty billow and as snug 
ply to his bearer both their motion mix 
and be consider in their site together 
they do the best present the state of man 
in his first royalty rule and of beast 
in their first loyalty serve one command 
and no way be move the other serve 
and no way be compel of all the sight 
that ever my eye witness and they make 
a doctrinal and witty hieroglyphic 
of a bless kingdom to express and teach 
king to command as they can serve and subject 
to serve as if they have power to command 

you be a good old horseman I perceive 
and still out all the use of that good part 
your wit be of the true pierean spring 
that can make any thing of any thing 

so brave a subject as the duke no king 
seat on earth can vaunt of but your highness 
so valiant loyal and so great in service 

no question he set valour in his height 
and have do service to a equal pitch 
fortune attend he with fit event 
to all his venturous and welllaid attempt 

fortune to he be Juno to Alcides 
for when or where do she but open way 
to any act of he what stone take he 
with her help or without his own lose blood 
what sort win he by she or be not force 
what victory but against odds on what commander 
sleepy or negligent do he ever charge 
what summer ever make she fair to he 
what winter not of one continue storm 
fortune be so far from his creditress 
that she owe he much for in he her look 
be lovely modest and magnanimous 
constant victorious and in his achievement 
her cheek be draw out with a virtuous redness 
out of his eager spirit to victory 
and chaste contention to convince with honour 
and I have hear his spirit have flow so high 
in all his conflict against any odds 
that in his charge his lip have bleed with terror 
how serve he at your famous siege of Dreux 
where the enemy assure of victory 
draw out a body of four thousand horse 
and twice six thousand foot and like a crescent 
stand for the signal you that show yourself 
a sound old soldier think it not fit 
to give your enemy the odds and honour 
of the first stroke command de la Guiche 
to let fire all his cannon that do pierce 
the adverse thick squadron and have shoot 
nine volley ere the foe have once give fire 
your troop be charge and when your duke old father 
meet with the assailant and their grove of reiters 
repulse so fierce make they turn their beard 
and rally up themselves behind their troop 
fresh force see your troop a little severe 
from that part first assault give it charge 
which then this duke make good second his father 
beat through and through the enemy great strength 
and break the rest like billow against a rock 
and there the heart of that huge battle break 

the heart but now come on in that strong body 
of twice two thousand horse lead by Du main 
which if I will be glorious I can say 
I first encounter 

how do he take in 
beaune in view of that invincible army 
lead by the lord great constable of Castille 
Autun and Nuis in Burgundy chase away 
viscount I'avanne troop before Dijon 
and put himself in and there that be win 

if you will only give i leave my lord 
I will do right to he yet must not give 

a league from fountain Francois when you send he 
to make discovery of the Castille army 
when he discern it be it with wondrous wisdom 
join to his spirit he seem to make retreat 
but when they press he and the baron of lux 
set on their charge so hot that his horse 
be slay and he most dangerous engage 
then turn your brave duke head and with such ease 
as do a echo beat back violent sound 
with their own force he as if a wall 
start sudden before they pash they all 
flat as the earth and there be that field win 

you be all the field wide 

o I ask you pardon 
the strength of that field yet lie in his back 
upon the foe part and what be to come 
of this your marshal now your worthy duke 
be much beyond the rest for now he see 
a sort of horse troop issue from the wood 
in number near twelve hundred and retire 
to tell you that the entire army follow 
before he can relate it he be force 
to turn head and receive the main assault 
of five horse troop only with twenty horse 
the first he meet he tumble to the earth 
and break through all not daunt with two wound 
one on his head another on his breast 
the blood of which drown all the field in doubt 
your majesty himself be then engage 
your power not yet arrive and up you bring 
the little strength you have a cloud of foe 
ready to burst in storm about your ear 
three squadron rush against you and the first 
you take so fierce that you beat their thought 
out of their bosom from the urge fight 
the second all amaze you overthrow 
the three disperse with five and twenty horse 
leave of the fourscore that pursue the chase 
and this brave conquest now your marshal second 
against two squadron but with fifty horse 
one after other he defeat they both 
and make they run like man who heel be trip 
and pitch their head in their great general lap 
and he he set on as he have be shoot 
out of a cannon beat he into rout 
and as a little brook be overrun 
with a black torrent that bear all thing down 
his fury overtake his foamy back 
load with cattail and with stack of corn 
and make the miserable ploughman mourn 
so be du Maine surcharge and so Byron 
flow over all his force every drop 
of his lose blood buy with a worthy man 
and only with a hundred gentleman 
he win the place from fifteen hundred horse 

he win the place 

on my word so it be say 

fie you have be extreme misinform 

I only tell your highness what I hear 
I be not there and though I have be rude 
with wonder of he valour and presume 
to keep his merit in his full career 
not hear you when you make such a thunder 
pardon my fault since it be to extol your servant 
but be it not most true that betwixt you both 
so few achieve the conquest of so many 

it be a truth must make i ever thankful 
but not perform by he be not I there 
command he and in the main assault 
make he but second 

he be the capital soldier 
that live this day in holy Christendom 
except your highness always except Plato 

we must not give to one to take from many 
for not to praise our countryman here serve 
the general my lord Norris send from England 
as great a captain as the world afford 
one fit to lead and fight for Christendom 
of more experience and of strong brain 
as valiant for abide in command 
on any sudden upon any ground 
and in the form of all occasion 
as ready and as profitable dauntless 
and here be then another colonel Williams 
a worthy captain and more like the duke 
because he be less temperate than the general 
and be familiar with the man you praise 
because he know he haughty and incapable 
of all comparison will compare with he 
and hold his swell valour to the mark 
justice have set in he and not his will 
and as in open vessel fill with water 
and on man shoulder bear they put treene cup 
to keep the wild and slippery element 
from wash over follow all his sway 
and tickle aptness to exceed his bound 
and at the brim contain he so this knight 
swim in Byron and hold he but to right 
but leave these hot comparison he be i own 
and then what I possess I will more be know 

all this shall to the duke I fish for this exeunt 

a feign passion in his hear now 
which he think I perceive not make conscience 
of the revolt that he have urge to i 
which now he mean to prosecute will sound 
how deep he stand affect with that scruple 
as when the moon have comfort the night 
and set the world in silver of her light 
the planet asterisims and whole state of heaven 
in beam of gold descend all the wind 
bind up in cave charge not to drive abroad 
their cloudy head a universal peace 
proclaim in silence of the quiet earth 
soon as her hot and dry fume be let loose 
storm and cloud mix sudden put out 
the eye of all those glory the creation 
turn into chaos and we then desire 
for all our joy of life the death of sleep 
so when the glory of our life man love 
clear conscience our fame and loyalty 
that do we worthy comfort be eclipse 
grief and disgrace invade we and for all 
our night of life beside our misery crave 
dark earth will open and hide we in our grave 

how strange be this 

what do your highness hear 

both hear and wonder that your wit and spirit 
and profit in experience of the slavery 
impose on we in those mere politic term 
of love fame loyalty can be carry up 
to such a height of ignorant conscience 
of cowardice and dissolution 
in all the freeborn power of royal man 
you that have make way through all the guard 
of jealous state and see on both your side 
the pike point charge heaven to let you pass 
will you in fly with a scrupulous wing 
above those pike to heavenward fall on they 
this be like man that spirit with wine 
pass dangerous place safe and die for fear 
with only thought of they be simple sober 
we must in pass to our wish end 
through thing call good and bad be like the air 
that even interpose betwixt the sea 
and the oppose element of fire 
at either touch but partake with neither 
be neither hot nor cold but with a sleight 
and harmless temper mix of both the extreme 

it be shrewd 

there be no truth of any good 
to be discern on earth and by conversion 
nought therefore simple bad but as the stuff 
prepare for arras picture be no picture 
till it be form and man have cast the beam 
of his imaginous fancy through it 
in form ancient king and conqueror 
as he conceive they look and be attire 
though they be nothing so so all thing here 
have all their price set down from man concept 
which make all term and action good or bad 
and be but pliant and wellcoloured thread 
put into feign image of truth 
to which to yield and kneel as truth pure king 
that pull we down with clear truth of their gospel 
be superstition to be hiss to hell 

believe it this be reason 

it be the faith 
of reason and of wisdom 

you persuade 
as if you can create what man can shun 
the search and compression of your grace 

we must have these lure when we hawk for friend 
and wind about they like a subtle river 
that seem only to run on his course 
do search yet as he run and still find out 
the easy part of entry on the shore 
glide so sly by as scarce it touch 
yet still eat some thing in it so must those 
that have large field and currant to dispose 
Come let we join our stream we must run far 
and have but little time the duke Savoy 
be short to be go and I must needs 
make you well know to he 

but have your highness 
some enterprise of value join with he 

with he and great person 

I will creep 
upon my bosom in your princely service 
vouchsafe to make i know I hear there live not 
so kind so bounty full and wise a prince 
but in your own except excellence 

he shall both know and love you be you i 

I take the honour of it on my knee 
and hope to quite it with your majesty Exit 

la fin be in the right and will obtain

that be seek as hard to win that sue to be win 

but be my painter warn to take his picture 
when he shall see i and present Laffin

all we will press about he and admire 
the royal promise of his rare aspect 
as if he hear not 

it will inflame he 
such trick the archduke use to extol his greatness 
which compliment though plain man hold absurd 
and a mere remedy for desire of greatness 
yet great man use they as they eat potato 
high coollises and potion to excite 
the lust of their ambition and this duke 
you know be note in his natural garb 
extreme glorious who will therefore bring 
a appetite expect such a bait 
he come go instant and fetch the painter 

all honour to your highness 

it be most true 
all honour flow to i in you their ocean 
as welcome worthy duke as if my marquisate 
be circle with you in these amorous arm 

I sorrow sir I can not bring it with i 
that I may so supply the fruitless compliment 
of only visit your excellence 
with which the king now send i to entertain you 
which notwithstanding do confer this good 
that it have give i some small time to show 
my gratitude for the many secret bounty 
I have by this your lord ambassador 
feel from your highness and in short to assure you 
that all my most desert be at your service

for defect 
of whatsoever in myself my lord 
I here commend to your most princely service

Laffin be this the man 
that you so recommend to my love 

the same my lord 

you be next my lord the duke 
the most desire of all man o my lord 
the king and I have have a mighty conflict 
about your conflict and your matchless worth 
in military virtue which I put 
in balance with the continent of France 
in all the peace and safety it enjoy 
And make even weight with all he can put in 
of all man else and of their own desert 

of all man else will he weigh other man 
with my deserve 

I upon my life 
the english general the mylord Norris 
that serve among you here he parallel 
with you at all part and in some prefer he 
and colonel Williams a welsh colonel 
he make a man that at your most contain you 
which the welsh herald of their praise the cuckoo 
will scarce have put in his monology 
in jest and say with reverence to his merit 

with reverence reverence scorn he by the spoil 
of all her merit in i he shall rue it 
do ever curtain gulf play such a part 
have Curtius be so use if he have brook 
that ravenous whirlpool pour his solid spirit 
through earth dissolve sinew stop her vein 
and rise with save Rome upon his back 
as I swim pool of fire and gulf of brass 
to save my country thrust this venturous arm 
beneath her ruin take she on my neck 
and set her safe on she appease shore 
And open the king a foul bog than this 
in his so rot bosom to devour 
he that devour what else have swallow he 
in a detraction so with spite imbrue 
and drown such good in such ingratitude 
my spirit as yet but stoop to his rest 
shine hot in he as the sun in cloud 
purple and make proud with a peaceful even 
but when I thorough set to he his cheek 
will like those cloud forgo their colour quite 
and his whole blaze smoke into endless night 

nay nay we must have no such gall my lord 
overflow our friendly liver my relation 
only deliver my inflame zeal 
to your religious merit which methinks 
shall make your highness canonize a saint 

what have his arm be without my arm 
that with his motion make the whole field move 
and this hold up we still have victory 
when over charge with number his few friend 
retire amaze I set they on assure 
and what rude ruin seize on I confirm 
when I leave lead all his army reel 
one fall on other foul and as the Cyclops 
that have lose his eye strike every way 
his blow direct to no certain scope 
or as the soul depart from the body 
the body want coherence in his part 
can not consist but sever and dissolve 
so I remove once all his army shake 
pant and faint and be ever fly 
like wander pulse sperse through body die 

it can be deny it be all so true 
that what seem arrogance be desert in you 

what monstrous humour feed a prince blood 
be bad to good man and to bad man good 

well let these contradiction pass my lord 
till they be reconcile or put in form 
by power give to your will and you present 
the fashion of a perfect government 
in mean space but a word we have small time 
to spend in private which I wish may be 
with all advantage take lord Laffin 

be it not a face of excellent presentment 
though not so amorous with pure white and red 
yet be the whole proportion singular 

that ever I behold 

it have good line 
and tract draw through it the purfle rare 

I hear the famous and right learned earl 
and archbishop of Lions Pierce Pinac 
who be report to have wondrous judgement 
in man event and nature by their look 
upon his death bed visit by this duke 
he tell his sister when his grace be go 
that he have never yet observe a face 
of worse presage than this and I will swear 
that something see in physiognomy 
I do not find in all the rule he give 
one slender blemish tend to mishap 
but on the opposite part as we may see 
on tree late blossom when all frost be past 
how they be take and what will be fruit 
so on this tree of sceptre I discern 
how it be load with appearance 
rule answer rule and glance crown with glance 

what do he take my picture 

I my lord 

your highness will excuse i I will give you 
my likeness put in statue not in picture 
and by a statuary of my own 
that can in brass express the wit of man 
and in his form make all man see his virtue 
other that with much strictness imitate 
the something stoop carriage of my neck 
the voluble and mild radiance of my eye 
never observe my masculine aspect 
and lionlike instinct it shadow 
which envy can say be flattery 
and I will have my image promise you 
cut in such matter it shall ever last 
where it shall stand fix with eternal root 
and with a most unmoved gravity 
for I will have the famous mountain Oros 
that look out of the duchy where I govern 
into your highness dukedom first make you 
and then with such inimitable art 
express and handle chief from the place 
where most conspicuous he show his face 
that though it keep the true form of that hill 
in all his longitude and latitude 
his height his distance and full proportion 
yet shall it clear bear my counterfeit 
both in my face and all my lineament 
and every man shall say this be Byron 
within my left hand I will hold a city 
which be the city Amiens at who siege 
I serve so memorable from my right 
I will pour a endless flood into a sea 
rage beneath i which shall intimate 
my ceaseless service drink up by the king 
as the ocean drink up river and make all 
bear his proud title ivory brass and gold 
that thief may purchase and be buy and sell 
shall not be use about i last worth 
shall only set the duke of Byron forth

with any nearness to your own instruction 
that statue will I prize past all the jewel

most royal duke we can not long endure 
to be thus private let we then conclude 
with this great resolution that your wisdom 
will not forget to cast a please veil 
over your anger that may hide each glance

that it be only keep and not lay out 
to such affectionate profit as we wish 
be so much set on fire with his desert 
that they consume we not to be restore 
by your presentment of he but his person 
and we have think that he who virtue fly 
so beyond wonder and the reach of thought 
shall check at eight hour sail and his high spirit 
that stoop to fear less than the pole of heaven 
shall doubt a under billow of the sea 
and be a sea be spare of his stream 
and I must blame all you that may advise he 
that have help he through all martial danger 
you let he stick at the kind rite of peace 
consider all the force I have send 
to set his martial sea up in firm wall 
on both his side for he to pass at pleasure 
do plain open he a guard way 
and lead in nature to this friendly shore 
but here be nothing worth his personal sight 
here be not wall city for that crystal 
shed with his light his hardness and his height 
about our thankful person and our realm 
who only aid we ever yet desire 
and now I see the help we send to he 
which shall have swim to he in our own blood 
have it be needful our affection 
be more give to his good than he himself 
end in the actual right it do his state 
and we be slight all our worth be make 
the commonstock and bank from whence be serve 
all man occasion yet thanks to heaven 
their gratitude be draw dry not our bounty 
and you shall tell your king that he neglect 
old friend for new and set his soothe ease 
above his honour marshal policy 
in rank before his justice and his profit 
before his royalty his humanity go 
to make i no repayment of my own 

what answer the duke 

in this sort 
your highness sweet speech have no sharp end 
than he will wish his life if he neglect 
the least grace you have name but to his wish 
much power be want the green root of war 
not yet so close cut up but he may dash 
against their relic to his utter ruin 
without more near eye fix upon his foot 
than those that look out of his country soil 
and this may well excuse his personal presence 
which yet he oft have long to set by you 
that he may imitate the majesty 
which so long peace have practise and make full 
in your admire appearance to illustrate 
and rectify his habit in rude war 
and his will to be here must needs be great 
since heaven have throne so true a royalty here 
that he think no king absolute crown 
who temple have not stand beneath this sky 
and who height be not harden with these star 
who influence for this altitude 
distil and wrought in with this temperate air 
and this division of the element 
have with your reign bring forth more worthy spirit 
for counsel valour height of wit and art 
than any other region of the earth 
or be bring forth to all your ancestor 
and as a cunning orator reserve 
his fair simile bestadorning figure 
chief matter and most move argument 
for his conclusion and do then supply 
his groundstream lay before glide over they 
make his full depth see through and so take up 
his audience in applause past the cloud 
so in your government conclusive nature 
willing to end her excellence in earth 
when your foot shall be set upon the star 
show all her sovereign beauty ornament 
virtue and rapture overtake her work 
in former empire make they but your foil 
swell to her full sea and again do drown 
the world in admiration of your crown 

he do she at all part confess right 

she take it yet but as a part of courtship 
and say he be the subtle orator 
to who he do too glorious resemble 
nature in she and in her government 
he say he be no orator but a soldier 
more than this air in which you breathe have make i 
my studious love of your rare government 
and simple truth which be most eloquent 
your empire be so ample absolute 
that even your theater show more comely rule 
true noblesse royalty and happiness 
then other court you make all state before 
utter obsolete all to come twice sod 
and therefore do my royal sovereign wish 
your year may prove as vital as your virtue 
that stand on his turret this way turn 
order and fix his affair by you 
he may at last on firm ground pass your sea 
and see that maidensea of majesty 
in who chaste arm so many kingdom lie 

when come she to her touch of his ambition 

in this speech follow which I thus remember 
if I hold any merit worth his presence 
or any part of that your courtship give i 
my subject have bestow it some in counsel 
in action some and in obedience all 
for none know with such proof as you my lord 
how much a subject may renown his prince 
and how much prince of their subject hold 
in all the service that ever subject 
do for his sovereign he that best deserve 
must in comparison except Byron 
and to win this prize clear without the maim 
common give man by ambition 
when all their part lie open to his view 
show continence past their other excellence 
but for a subject to affect a kingdom 
be like the camel that of jove beg horn 
and such madhungry man as well may eat 
hot coal of fire to feed their natural heat 
for to aspire to competence with your king 
what subject be so gross and giantly 
he have now a dauphin bear to he 
who birth ten day before be dreadful 
usher with earthquake in most part of Europe 
and that give all man cause enough to fear 
all thought of competition with he 
commend we good my lord and tell our brother 
how much we joy in that his royal issue 
and in what prayer we raise our heart to heaven 
that in more terror to his foe and wonder 
he may drink earthquake and devour the thunder 
so we admire your valour and your virtue 
and ever will contend to win their honour 
then speak she to Crequy and prince de Auvergne 
and give all gracious farewell when Byron 
be thus encounter by a councillor 
of great and eminent name and matchless merit 
I think my lord your princely dauphin bear 
Arion in his cradle through your kingdom 
in the sweet music joy strike from his birth 
he answer and good right the cause command it 
but say the other have we a five Henry 
to claim his old right and one man to friend 
who you well know my lord that for his friendship 
be promise the viceroyalty of France 
we will not doubt of conquest in despite 
of all those windy earthquake he reply 
treason be never guide to english conquest 
and therefore that doubt shall not fright our dauphin 
nor will I be the friend to such a foe 
for all the royalty in Christendom 
Fix there your foot say he I only give 
false fire and will be loath to shoot you of 
he that win empire with the loss of faith 
outbuy it and will bankrupt you have lay 
a brave foundation by the hand of victory 
put not the roof to fortune foolish statuary 
that under little saint suppose great base 
make less to sense the saint and so where fortune 
advance vile mind to state great and noble 
she much more expose they to shame 
not able to make good and fill their base 
with a conform structure I have find 
thank to the blesser of my search that counsel 
hold to the line of justice still produce 
the sure state and great be sure 
without which fit assurance in the great 
as you may see a mighty promontory 
more dig and undereaten then may warrant 
a safe supportance to his hang brow 
all passenger avoid he shun all ground 
that lie within his shadow and bear still 
a fly eye upon he so great man 
corrupt in their ground and build out 
too swell front for their foundation 
when most they shall be prop be most forsake 
and man will rather thrust into the storm 
of better ground state then take a shelter 
beneath their ruinous and fearful weight 
yet they so oversee their faulty base 
that they remain secure in conceit 
and that security do worse presage 
their near destruction than their eat ground 
and therefore heaven itself be make to we 
a perfect hieroglyphic to express 
the idleness of such security 
and the grave labour of a wise distrust 
in both sort of the allenclying star 
where all man note this difference in their shine 
as plain as they distinguish either hand 
the fix star manner and the err stand 

How take he this so worthy admonition 

grave apply say he and like the man 
who all the world say overrule the star 
which be divine book to we and be read 
by understander only the true object 
and chief companion of the true man 
and though I need it not I thank your counsel 
that never yet be idle but spherelike 
still move about and be the continent 
to this bless I will 

the circle of this embassy be close 
for which I long have long for my own end 
to see my faithful and leave courtly friend 
to who I come methinks with such a spirit 
as you have see a lusty courser show 
that have be long time at his manger tie 
high fead alone and when his headstall break 
he run his prison like a trumpet neigh 
cut air in high curvet and shake his head 
with wanton stopping betwixt his foreleg mock 
the heavy centre spread his fly crest 
like to a ensign hedge and ditch leap 
till in the fresh meat at his natural food 
he see free fellow and have meet they free 
and now good friend I will be fain inform 
what our right princely lord the duke of Savoy 
have think on to employ my come home 

to try the king trust in you and withal 
how hot he trail on our conspiracy 
he first will have you beg the government 
of the important citadel of Bourg 
or to place in it any you shall name 
which will be wondrous fit to march before 
his other purpose and be a fort 
he rate in love above his patrimony 
to make which fortress worthy of your suit 
he vow if you obtain it to bestow 
his three fair daughter on your excellence 
and hope the king will not deny it you 

deny it i deny i such a suit 
who will he grant if he deny it i 

he will find some politic shift to do it I fear 

what shift or what evasion can he find 
what one patch be there in all policy shop 
that butcher up of kingdom that can mend 
the brack betwixt we any way deny 

that be at your peril 

Come he dare not do it 

dare not presume not so you know good duke 
that all thing he think fit to do he dare 

by heaven I wonder at you I will ask it 
as stern and secure of all repulse 
as the ancient persian do when they implore 
their idol fire to grant they any boon 
with which they will descend into a flood 
and threaten there to quench it if they fail 
of that they ask it 

say like your king king 
cold have no act in depth nor be suit wrought 
of any high price that be cold seek 
I will haste and with your courage comfort Savoy Exit Laffin 

I be your friend my lord and will deserve 
that name with follow any course you take 
yet for your own sake I can wish your spirit 
will let you spare all broad term of the king 
or on my life you will at last repent it 

what can he do 

all that you can not fear 

you fear too much be by when next I see he 
and see how I will urge he in this suit 
he come mark you that think 
he will not grant it 
I be become a suitor to your highness 

for what my lord it be like you shall obtain 

I do not much doubt that my service 
I hope have more strength in your good conceit 
then to receive repulse in such request 

what be it 

that you will bestow on one who I shall name 
the keep of the citadel of Bourg 

excuse i sir I must not grant you that 

not grant i this suit 

it be not fit I shall 
you be my governor in Burgundy 
and province governor that command in chief 
ought not to have the charge of fortress 
beside it be the chief key of my kingdom 
that open towards Italy and must therefore 
be give to one that have immediate 
dependence on we 

these be wondrous reason 
be not a man depend on his merit 
as fit to have the charge of such a key 
as one that mere hang upon your humour 

do not enforce your merit so yourself 
it take away their luster and reward 

but you will grant my suit 

I swear I can 
keep the credit of my brain and place 

will you deny i then 

I be enforce 
I have no power more than yourself in thing 
that be beyond my reason 

then myself 
that be a strange sleight in your comparison 
be I become the example of such man 
as have lest power such a diminutive 
I be comparative in the better sort 
and such a king as you will say I can 
do such or such a thing be I as great 
in power as he even that indefinite he 
express i full this moon be strange change 

how can I help it will you have a king 
that have a white beard have so green a brain 

a plague of brain what do this touch your brain 
you must give i more reason or I swear 

swear what do you swear 

I swear you wrong i 
and deal not like a king to jest and sleight 
a man that you shall curious reward 
tell i of your grey beard it be not grey 
with care to recompense i who ease your care 

you have be recompense from head to foot 

with a distrust dukedom take your dukedom 
bestow on i again it be not give 
for any love but fear and force of shame 

yet it be your honour which if you respect not 
why seek you this addition 

since this honour 
will show you love i to in trust i 
without which love and trust honour be shame 
a very pageant and a property 
honour with all his adjunct I deserve 
and you quit my desert with your grey beard 

since you expostulate the matter so 
I tell you plain another reason be 
why I be move to make you this denial 
that I suspect you to have have intelligence 
with my vow enemy 

misery of virtue 
ill be make good with worse this reason pour 
poison for balm into the wound you make 
you make i mad and rob i of my soul 
to take away my try love and my truth 
which of my labor which of all my wound 
which overthrow which battle win for you 
breed this suspicion can the blood of faith 
lose in all these to find it proof and strength 
beget disloyalty all my rain be fall 
into the horsefair spring pool and mire 
and not in thankful ground or field of fruit 
fall then before we oh thou flame crystal 
that be the uncorrupted register 
of all man merit and remonstrate here 
the fight the danger the affright and horror 
whence I have rescue this unthankful king 
and show commix with they the joy the glory 
of his state then then his kind thought of i 
than my deserve now my infamy 
but I will be my own king I will see 
that all your chronicle be fill with i 
that none but I and my renown sire 
be say to win the memorable field 
of Arques and deep and none but we of all 
keep you from die there in a hospital 
none but myself that win the day at Dreux 
a day of holy name and needs no night 
nor none but I at fountain Francois burst 
the heart string of the leaguer I alone 
take Amiens in these arm and hold she fast 
in spite of all the pitchy fire she cast 
and cloud of bullet pour upon my breast 
till she show you and take her natural form 
only myself marry to victory 
do people Artois Douay Picardy 
Bethune and saint Paul Bapaume and Courcelles 
with her triumphant issue 

ha ha ha exit

respect revenge slaughter repay for laughter 
what be grave in earth what awful what abhor 
if my rage be ridiculous I will make it 
the law and rule of all thing serious 
so long as such as he

so long be mischief gather massacre 
for their curse kingdom which I will prevent 
laughter I will fright it from he far as he 
have cast irrevocable shame which ever

shall king cast of their bounty with their danger 
he that can warm at fire where virtue burn 
hunt pleasure through her torment nothing feel 
of all his subject suffer but long hide 
in want and misery and have pass 
through all the grave shape of worth and honour 
for all heroic fashion to be learn 
by those hard lesson show a antique vizard 
who will not wish he rather hew to nothing 
then leave so monstrous slight my service 
drown the dead noise of my sword in laughter 
my blow as but the passage of shadow 
over the high and most barren hill 
and use i like no man but as he take i 
into a desert gash with all my wound

o my lord 
this be to large a licence give your fury 
give time to it what reason sudden 
can not extend respite do oft supply 

while respite hold revenge the wrong redouble 
and so the shame of sufferance it torment i 
to think what I endure at his shrink hand

Byron 

my lord the king call 

turn I pray 
how now from whence flow these distract face 
from what attempt return they as disclaim 
their late heroic bearer what a pistol 
why good my lord can mirth make you so wrathful 

mirth it be mockery a contempt a scandal 
to my renown for ever a repulse 
as miserable cold as stygian water 
that from sincere earth issue and do break 
the strong vessel not to be contain 
but in the tough hoof of a patient ass 

my lord your judgement be not competent 
in this dissension I may say of you 
as fame say of the ancient Elean 
that in the olympian contention 
they ever be the just arbitrator 
if none of they contend nor be party 
those that will moderate disputation well 
must not themselves affect the coronet 
for as the air contain within our ear 
if it be not in quiet nor refrain 
trouble our hear with offensive sound 
but our affect instrument of hear 
replete with noise and sing in itself 
it faithful receive no other voice 
so of all judgement if within themselves 
they suffer spleen and be tumultuous 
they can not equal difference without they 
and this wind that do sing so in your ear 
I know be no disease breed in yourself 
but whisper in by other who in swell 
your vein with empty hope of much yet able 
to perform nothing be like shallow stream 
that make themselves so many heaven to sight 
since you may see in they the moon and star 
the blue space of the air as far from we 
to our weak sense in those shallow stream 
as if they be as deep as heaven be high 
yet with your middle finger only sound they 
and you shall pierce they to the very earth 
and therefore leave they and be true to i 
or you will be leave by all or be like one 
that in cold night will needs have all the fire 
and there be hold by other and embrace 
only to burn he your fire will be inward 
which not another deluge can put out 
o innocence the sacred amulet 
against all the poison of infirmity 
of all misfortune injury and death 
that make a man in tune still in himself 
free from the hell to be his own accuser 
ever in quiet endle joy enjoy 
no strife nor no sedition in his power 
no motion in his will against his reason 
no thought against thought nor as it be in the confine 
of wish and repent do possess 
only a way ward and tumultuous peace 
but all part in he friendly and secure 
fruitful of all best thing in all worst season 
he can with every wish be in their plenty 
when the infectious guilt of one foul crime 
destroy the free content of all our time 

it be all acknowledge and though all too late 
here the short madness of my anger end 
if ever I do good I lock it safe 
in you the impregnable defence of goodness 
if ill I press it with my penitent knee 
to that unsounded depth whence nought return 

it be music to my ear rise then for ever 
quit of what guilt soever till this hour 
and nothing touch in honour or in spirit 
rise without flattery rise by absolute merit

yet love ofttimes must offer thing unneedful 
and therefore I will counsel you to hold 
all good term with his majesty of Spain 
if any trouble shall be stir betwixt you 
I will not stir therein but to appease they 
I have too much care of my royal word 
to break a peace so just and consequent 
without force of precedent injury
