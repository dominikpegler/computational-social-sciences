she will be well content but to live 
within my presence not for love to i 
but that she may with safety of her honour 
mix with some hot vein lecher who prone lust 
shall feed the rank impostume of desire 
and get a race of bastard to who birth 
I shall be think the dad but thou thou woman 
ere I will be the cloak to thy false play 
I will couple with a witch a hag for if 
thou can live chaste live by thy sell like i 
or if thou will persuade i that thou love i

if in a month a champion shall appear 
in single opposition to maintain 
your honour I will be the man myself

and which of we prevail shall end this strife 
but if none come than you shall lose your head 
mean time your usage shall be like a queen

still prompt my sense that my queen be fair 

fair unspeakable workmanship of heaven bounty be all the skilful painter that ever discern colour mould into one to perfect a artist yet that Artist shall soon want fancy or imagination for personate a curious medal then ever to pattern a counterfeit so exquisite excellent as be the queen by nature 

I have survey the wonder of her cheek

ill purchase life indeed who ransom crave 
a sad price than price of bloodshed save 
go learn bad woman what it be how foul 
by gain of a life to lose a soul 
the price of one soul do exceed as far 
a life here as the sun in light a star 
here though we live some threescore year or more 
yet we must die at last and quit the score 
we owe to nature but the soul once die 
die ever ever no repurify 
no earnest sigh or groan no intercession 
no tear no penance no too late confession 
can move the ear of justice if it doom 
a soul past cure to a infernal tomb 
make use of this Salassa

make it not infamous but when a beauty 
so most incomparable as you be blemish 
with the dishonourable stamp of whoredom 
when your black taint name which shall have be 
have you preserve it noble your best chronicle 
wherein you may have live when this be stain 
and just too then death do but heap 
affliction on the die yet you see 
with what a sympathy of equal grief 
I mourn your ruin 

will you can as clear 
perceive my innocence as I can clear 
protest it 

fie to justify a sin 
be worse than to commit it now you be faulty 

what a royal pair of excellent creature be here both upon the castaway it be a saint like mercy in you my lord to remit the memory of a past error and in you madam if you be guilty of the suppose crime to submit yourself to the king I dare promise his love to you be so unfeigned that it will relent in your humility pray do good madam do 

but how if I be free 

by any mean for your honour cause do not yield then one jot let not the faint fear of death deject you before the royalty of a erect heart do you hear this my lord it be a doubtful case almost impossible to be decide look upon she well as I hope to prosper she have a most virtuous a most innocent countenance never heed it I know my lord your jealousy and your affection wrestle together within you for they astery mark she beauty thorough now by all the power of love it be pity she shall not be as fair within as without

my whole felicity on earth in witness 
whereof behold my lord those manly tear 
which her unkindness and my cruel fate 
force from their quiet spring they speak aloud

be all conspire against i what thou too 
now by my father ash by my life 
thou be a villain a gross rancorous villain 
do not thou only first enforce my thought to jealousy

nay more 
do not thou feed those thought with fresh supply 
nam every circumstance

will you hear i

what can thou say impostor speak and choke 

I have not deserve this my lord and you shall find it it be true I must confess that I be the only instrument to incense you to this distemperature and I be proud to say it and say it again before this noble presence that I be myself the only man 

insufferable devil 

pray my lord 

wonder not my lord but lend i your attention I see with what violence he pursue his resolution not more in detestation of the queen in particular then of all her sex in general that I may not weary your patience I bend all my study to devise which way I may do service to my country by reclaim the distraction of his discontent and have feel his disposition in every pulse I find he most addict to this pestilence of jealousy with a strong persuasion of which I from time to time ever feed he by degree till I bring the queen and the noble Petruchi into the danger they yet stand in but with all and herein I appeal to your majesty own approbation I season my word with such a intermix the praise of the queen beauty that from jealousy I draw the king into a serious examination of her perfection 

thus far I must acknowledge he speak truth 

at length have find he indeed sure affect I perceive that nothing but the suppose blemish of her dishonour can work a second divorce between they 

true true fate own truth 

now my lord to clear that imputation I know how easy it will be by the apparent certainty itself in all which if I have err it be the error of a loyal service only I must ever acknowledge how just I have deserve a punishment in draw so virtuous a princess honour into public question and humble refer myself to her gracious clemency and your noble construction 

but can can this be so 

let i ever else be the subject of your rage in the sufferance of any torture 

and be she chaste Petruchi 

chaste by virtue 
as be the new bear virgin for aught I know 

I ever whisper so much in your ear my lord and tell you that it be impossible such singular endowment by nature shall yield to the corruption so much as of a unworthy thought 
do I not tell you so from time to time 

lay by your arm my lord and join with i
