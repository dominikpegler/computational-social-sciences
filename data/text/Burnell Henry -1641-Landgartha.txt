we now sweet lady and dear sister march not 
against the intemperate Frollo but ascend 
the milky way that lead to immortal fame 
not to be rank among the starmade harlot 
but state in the high empirical heaven 
to side the god where Pallas and chaste Phoebe 
arm chief with the weapon of their virtue 
keep all the masculine deity in awe 
this our design may well exalt we thither 
as their good deed do they that in defence 
of that all shall hold dear our honour lady 
do now expose ourselves to death and what 
a cruel vicious revengeful tyrant 
may inflict on we if vanquish yet this act 
of we we must not vain boast of for 
the little bird will with their beak and wing 
offend the ravisher of their young issue 
what then shall we perform think you that far 
pass these yield up your body base to 
foul rape and lust and so to infamy 
for ever no no far be this from we 
honour virgin that have such arm to wield 
these cut weapon be too to fight authorise 
by the example of the noble woman 
Semiramis Zenobia fair Cinana 
sister unto great Macedon stout Alvilda 
Cumilla and the amazonian queen 
great Mithridates queen and several other 
be pattern now for we to imitate 
oh most brave pattern yet this we may say 
that our chaste glory shall pass they as far 
as the worth of our intention do exceed 
the cause they undertake nor ought you doubt it 
let then the king of Denmark fight where he list 
we will pursue no other than our worst 
and strong adversary in his own squadron 
where I as first will lose my life or give 
a sudden end to his black purpose 
that fight a conquest on our chastity 

thy virtue and example niece that be not 
to be reach by any imitation 
at least of our endeavour do far more 
excite our courage than Hermes can 
be he now here to play the orator 
lead on then you shall find we no bad second 

I have more than a woman longing to begin 

I know Fatyma though she be not great 
have not the least desire to fight among we 

stay till you see i knock some great one down 
until when I shall well remit your praise 

then follow i and as you see i woo 
the Swedish king to his doe you so too exeunt a march 

it be my chief comfort noble cymbrian 
subject and friend to be your guide today 
against a valiant wicked adversary 
and for our right the inheritance of this kingdom 
to show that virtue and the cause do more 
prevail than any humane fortitude 
or settle counsel when they be join to vice 
and by injustice seek to advance their state 
which wise our forefather mask beneath 
the fable of the Titan against the god 
but it shall seem the virtue of our foe 
wisdom and valour have forsake by 
their palliardise by ease and hourly riot 
this kingdom be more fatal unto they 
than Capua be to Hannibal and therefore 
not worth your mean fear I must not then 
enlarge myself in word too far because 
you need they not nor need you be behold 
unto the fame of your brave ancestor 
those valiant cymbrian that almost give 
a end to Rome the mistress of the world 
and not in her decline day when her 
own vice have confound she as when 
the Goth and Vandal now our enemy 
do trample on she be down before 
she live full man when great king Beleus 
do on the border of rich Italy 
vanquish three of her brave general 
Sylanus Coepio and Manilius 
this if you please you may consider and 
that our foe be more famous for their whoredom 
than conquer of Norway reflect also 
how for this cause we be assist by 
a angel troop of chaste and noble lady 
who neither loss of life or other evil 
can fright from seek to revenge the wrong 
do to their sex their parent and their friend 
then let we not shame ourselves now in their presence 
or to posterity by be outgo 
by woman in a battle last consider 
the everlasting honour due to virtue 
of which we now shall make a glorious purchase 

I be afraid you will consider sir 
so long of these woman until you forget 
what you applaud so feel your virtue 

thou be always merry hubba honest withal 
and from my heart I wish that each man here 
perform a soldier part no worse than thou 
we shall not then be beat 

let we march on sir 
and you shall quick find the mean of they 
valiant and strong to purchase what be your birthright 

then let we move and prosper too as we 
affect injustice or impiety exeunt a march 

we must not lose our confidence brave warrior 
though we be take somewhat tardy by 
a sort of raw freshwater soldier weak 
unmartial woman fit for night encounter 
and some poor fugitive Norwegian rebel 
conquer and beat oft by we before 
what then although our number be the less 
yet not by much the glory of the adventure 
will not be worth the pain we under take else 
beside if we consider what our ancestor 
have by their neverequalled valour oft 
perform against the noble nation of 
the world this our design be nothing nothing 
to what they do what we have do ourselves 
and mean to do hereafter notwithstanding 
let i commend unto your memory 
after a general fashion for now 
the time exact deed more than word what some 
of their large conquest be not only in 
Europe which be all they a most but in 
Africa a three and rich part of the world 
which from the ocean unto Nile they win 
and from the midland sea to the torrid zone 
great Rome herself that wisdom boast most 
and next her valour be by our father take 
pillage and burn four time at least and her 
large empire bring to nothing she master all 
we master she 
and will not now degenerate first of we 
what though man say we be not religious 
religion be but a toy and first invent 
by politic state to keep fool in awe 
and of all man observe least by themselves 
if she but thwart the least of their intendment 
they glorify she much for their own end 
and that be even almost all and so may we 
yet honour by war riches and our pleasure 
shall be the altar and the god we will bow to 
in our free mind and what we gain we will keep 
king Reyner therefore be not wise in seek 
to dispossess the brave nation breathe 
of what they have achieve by the right of conquest 
and shall I hope in snatch at our crown 
by your more powerful arm soon miss his own Ex alarm 

fury and plague these wild wild bloody whore

apprehension of fear or any kind

you in good wish be otherwise 
too indigent to cancel what we be 
engage to you for many way 
we have be still oppress since your departure 
from we who virtuous presence be all 
the comfort we have with a heavy sadness 
nourish by grief nor do we ever hope 
to see the sun again but at a window 

the god defend you sir from give way 
to such despair enter Vald 

I follow after like 
a thief aloof to see what good success 
the king have in his love suit and to venture 
for my particular as he make his voyage 

your majesty must never entertain 
dark melancholy thought but quite cashier they 

her voice sound sweet than the celestial sphere 
in their harmonious motion I be more 
than ravish when I hear it and think I shall 
fall sick too or run frantic ere it belong 

I hear no mean physician often say sir 
that music and mirth be good for sickly man 

bid the boy sing the song we make of love 

this be a very love song 
your grace make but the content of it not 
to be apply to you sir that may command 
if power and person can compel the best 
and fair lady in the world to be you 
in a noble way and otherwise your virtue forbid it 

it do indeed forbid we what be vicious 
And see we do not hope for life we must 
crave your kind pardon now to hear we tell 
the occasion of our sickness brief thus 
you be the only cause on it 

how I my liege 
my knowledge say not so 

your beauty valour 
and all the perfection part to other 
but in you conjoin protest it and I 
for one can swear it but be repel 
by a severelyawing rigor from your brow 
yet sweet withal though kill and be tell 
of a sad purpose you have never to marry 
we now be fall thus low beneath the centre 
of deep despair and sorrow and desire 
you will say something either to hasten our death 
or to recall it by a love sentence 

I must take sometime then to deliberate 
aside 

be you in that you may command we she go aside and the lady with she 

we expect no such entertainment 

my mind foretell i still of some disaster 

notwithstanding your resolution 
not to marry you have not vow against 
obedience to a man in that friendly 
yoke of wedlock the king sound affection 
be not then to be reject if you ever 
take any 

if I do he shall be the man 

you must not study now long for some answer 

he be desperate ill and if you shall 
give he a flat denial we may be 
all seize on here at court and some villainy 
commit on we be to defend ourselves 
too few by many 

they shall take our life 
ere we will endure to be defile 

and with 
the loss of some of they 

have you consider 
yet of the doom you be to pronounce 

all stand 
wary on their guard 

your poor subject sir 
must rather expect in duty your command 

nay sweet lady do not increase my torment 
by add affliction to misery 
with a compliment but something say that 
may appertain to the matter to rid i 
quick of my pain 

it be sure I have not 
although I ever mean it bound myself 
unto a single life 

then dear lady 
consider who I be and what I now be 
lodge thus for though I claim you not as by desert 
or duty yet be your prince you owe i 
some regard and all I ever must glory in 
shall be to make you queen of what be we 

may it please you sir 

pray you sit and speak 
or I must rise if weakness will permit she sit and the rest stand 

have I be ambitious when you be not 
crown king of Norway I can then perchance 
have write queen unto your prejudice 
but for that Frollo once intend foul 
I that can not affect vice do refuse 
what he with earnestness and many oath 
seek to confirm and be his bane at last 
though I believe that what he say he mean 
now therefore sir your affection ground 
in way of honour without taint of baseness 
with such exterior sign too of deep love 
to i unworthy of so great a prince 
I can nor will my heart permit it but 
in way of gratefulness reciprocal 
requite with love again as duty bind 
nay more than so but yet gracious sir 
I that be mean and poor to be your consort 
and that thing of this kind be oft repent 
do now beseech you to decline a while 
the vehemency of your fleet desire 
and take full time to think on what you do 
be it but to take a near view of i 
and that in all point for know sir the honour 
you now afford i compare to the infamy 
that will redound to both of we and to other 
by who you be to be advise if aught 
shall chance amiss when thing be consummate 
be nothing will but heighten your disgrace 
your wise demur too I shall take as full payment 
for all my service and rest devote 
more deep you and evermore continue

give i a hat I will walk with you forth 
into the gallery and tell you there

impossible that if you think i not

I must kiss thou too Rolfo 
within Rolfo rogue 

anon anon sir as they kiss 

nay Rolfo for all 
your haste I must for my brother sake take 
off that kiss from thy now sweet though greasy lip they kiss 

and now farewell but not for ever my dear 
and best of friend Rad we will part at tother tavern 

then arm in arm let be march most worthy brother exeunt 

I can not otherwise choose mistress though 
your distrust of my unfeigned affection 
keep i thus long from enjoy what I 
most desire in a noble way but come 
urge by that love that ever shall remain 
with i wheresoever I go to tender 
the duty of a servant in take leave 
of you before my sudden departure 

it be indeed too sudden and I do now 
repent the not embrace what I be not 
enough good to accept your love for I confess 
though somewhat late I love you more than you 
do i and ever shall unless the fault 
be only you in prove which I do 
not yet suspect a changeling I shall for 
my part punish severe in myself 
the offence of not be you by a continue 
sadness and grief till once again I see you 

and though I have be too much note for 
my mirth which yet be never saw with spite 
or other bad condition I promise 
por my misfortune in thus miss of you 
not to laugh once unless against my will 
at some unlucky chance till I possess 
the treasure I most covet 

that if you 
mean i shall be you when we meet next and 
safe keep for you until then in the mean time 
I shall chary preserve though but a poor 
satisfaction for you your image in 
the interior of my mind 

which overpay 
with much advantage all my service 

it be a strange resolution of the king 
to leave his queen she be so much against it 
and he so strange fond of she at first 
which she deserve be a lady the world 
can match 

he be these thirty hour in Denmark 
where if he prove unkind to she that can 
in true judgement condemn other that like not 
such proceed 

he have need be circumspect 
in what he do or he may soon repent it 
and perchance 
when matter prove past remedy to he 
yet while I find you sound no alien fault 
shall make i hate what once I so affect 

rest on that assurance I must now 
crave the kind favour of a part kiss 

that you shall have they kiss and half a dozen more 
when you come to your ship for so far I 
will with you and will along to Denmark but to try 
if I may build upon your constancy exeunt 

it be now but need we both look to ourselves 
or we may pay the forfeit of our slackness 
with the loss of both our head upon a scaffold 
for Reyner have cast the fair Landgartha 
off of who he be not worthy and by 
a dreadful precipice fall from much goodness 
he will not stop at his first fault but hurry 
by the guiltiness of his conscience 
run headlong down the hill upon the rock 
of dangerous mischief to which he be now engage 

she be a lady of so stout a heart 
that when she find he base although she love he 
exceed she can but be revenge 
for her repudiation and disgrace 

and may prove our strong friend to ruin he 
that have threaten and that not private 
to rid himself on we 

and will if he can 
you may by his death then that will be you 
settle yourself secure in his kingdom 
by match and partake now with she 

brother the man who deity we adore 
and who to give we rest still live without it 
can witness for i can I but persuade 
my mind by any probability 
it be possible for i to live in peace here 
and not have my throat cut although my right 
unto the crown of Denmark be apparent 
my title while I sleep or wake shall sleep 
as when king Reyner live a virtuous kind man 
for I delight not in the expense of blood 
though I fear not to spend my own in a 
just cause but see all rest be deny i 
as the strong law of nature bind I must 
shift for myself the best I may which shall not 
be effect by base treachery or murder 
nor do I chief yet mean to rely 
on the brave landgartha assistance who the 
love of a wife and hope of reconcilement 
may urge beyond all spirit of revenge 

what be it you mean to plot then for our safety 

we will to the pious christian emperor 
Lewis the debonair who as you know 
do oft solicit i to plead my right 
to the crown by dent of sword that be the best 
nay only patent Reyner have to show for it 
though he from be father get it which do lessen 
much his guilt 

it be not his guilt that now most trouble he 
but by more sin to guard it 

twelve thousand 
expert soldier that lie near here of the border 
of Germany I may have when I list 
to add with all speed to our own sure friend 
and unto other that will fall in troop 
from now dishonour Reyner for his base 
adultery intend with Vraca 
to strengthen himself against his wife and i 

unheard of madness so vile to betray 
and to be own ruin a poor and virtuous lady 
that but for he and his damn shameless lie 
have never marry any be withal 
as it be report most extreme fair 
far far beyond the other 

such be the folly 
of humane nature when it be forsake 
of he that make it but we will now make use on it 

you shall be sudden lest we be lay hold on 
and to take he unprepared 

when night ascend 
her sable chariot we will both of we 
mount on our best horse post away 
and be I hope ere we be miss pass danger 
Come let we therefore in and lose no time 
which in necessity be a fatal crime exeunt 

you be happy beyond expectation 
in your embassage for all man do conceive 
and very probable the queen will aid 
with the utmost of her power Harrold in his 
design for Denmark but she noble lady 
although in outward show she have not grant 
what you demand I know such be her virtue 
and love nature be come in her mind 
now to assist your most ungracious king 

for which in chief he be to you behold 
though he deserve it not at his departure 
but now contrition have wipe off his guilt 
though not the punishment before the god 
nor be there any hope leave we on earth 
but what we now may gain here by your mean 

have you but be a witness of her grief 
able to rive a heart of steel you have 
melt as we almost do into tear 
especial when she hear of the infamous 
marriage with Swealand daughter tell she by 
a whisper flatterer how than she tear 
her golden hair and use such cruelty 
on her fair limb which have wellnear end she 
notwithstanding what we can do to hinder it 
curse the time when she ever see a Dane 
not for her husband renegade most 
but the loss of her virginity and foul 
disgrace 

we hear of all yet be compel 
by strong necessity perforce to build 
on her heroic goodness and your worth 

it be well conceive and better put to trial 
that compulsion may work peace again 

here the divine lady come her self unto we enter Landgartha Scania Elsinora fatyma and Marfisa in woman apparel with sword on 

although lord Inguar your sovereign and my 
unkind husband be rather to expect 
sharp war and hate then any aid from i 
in his distress have as far as it lie 
in he disgrace i by his flight and as 
I will use false play with other yet my love 
to he deep engrave in my heart 
join to my own innocence and merit have 
as all may see get the upperhand and stop 
my once intend course of strict revenge 
though he enjoy another wife now the mistress 
of what be i by bond 

most gracious queen 
I can say nothing to excuse his guilt 
or lessen it but that your virtue shine 
the bright for his deep ingratitude 
which now be the great corrosive to himself 
and cause of all his evil by the loss 
of in a manner all be he before 
and that his act have render both of you 
famous to all the world in different manner 
you as the glorious mirror of all worth 
but he with grief I speak it for be offence 

which now dear madam as it be repent 
exact your mercy more than punishment 

to prove a last pyramid to all 
succeed time of such a noble act 

it can yield you no benefit to ruin 
he and his poor subject be also you 
and in their love they be you 

much more than his 
I do believe 

madam I can depose it to Fatyma 
and that they have ever deem it their chief glory 
to have have she for their queen their heart he lose 
when he lose she nor be there aught can raise 
the mind of the few that now stick to he but her 
strong assistance and the try valour of the 
Norwegian lady that before 
give we the victory against the Swede 

king Reyner and yourself lord Inguar have 
too many friend here to be deny in what 
our power may stead he or you demand 
and I be the more induce to pardon his fault 
that I acknowledge myself faulty too 
and which my heart have oft accuse i for 
with no small grief in grant that to he 
under the flatter title of marriage which I 
resolve never to he lose and which he dare not 
seek to have force from i but it be now past help 

there be one way yet leave madam to help all 

he then transport by his fierce desire 
which slave he by craft I will give it no worse 
a name do that wrong to my modesty 
which I be not so deep in passion 
may well have hinder and by yield to it 
have give scope for other to condemn i 

which none can just do for I be assure 
madam though you have cause not to believe it 
that his intent to your grace be sincere 
at first as now they be and therefore dear queen 
you be to meet his past ill with your goodness 
which if you do not speedy there will be 
no time nor mean hereafter leave for you 
to exercise your valour in this cause 

when we behold our neighbour house on fire 
the proverb say we ought look to our own 
this you conceive and I suppose you be 
inform by these that love you that we have 
as many valiant man and woman in 
a readiness as may if heaven be please 
for we be please in it reinthrone your king 
and chase those rebel that now urge his flight 
let then my brother the prince Valdemar

a lodging for you

your bedfellow tomorrow night 

and I shall strain myself to bid you welcome 

the king will do as much too for your highness

people will then say that I go to ask it smile 
nor do he need i have one at least

to make all sure by join our last issue 
with Reyner ere the brave Landgartha come 
who he once more think to deceive for where 
she lead all go to wrack in the other side 

it be strange so stout a mind as she shall ever 
yield love or obedience to a man that have 
so base deal to she 

she square all her 
action by the rule of goodness not 
of passion and think this deed of she 
a very grateful offering to her god

if in the mean time sir you do what lie in you 
with patience soon rid you of those fear 
and state you as before and in her love too 

I never shall see that halcyon day again 
to see she hubba though you all suppose 
the contrary and cause i send to move 
her goodness she be too magnanimous

who force be too weak to bear the blow 
of their disease yield and languish under 
the weight that be insupportable 

the weak 
their mind be the more they yield beyond 
necessity and thereby become chief actor 
in their own tragedy 

I know you speak this 
to prepare my mind for the bad news you bring 

your virtue will now most consist in not 
be over joy when you read this letter 
write and send by she that say she love you 

let i see it I know the hand it be she 
oh let i let i kiss it kiss it still kiss the letter 
and not presume to look what it contain 
to plague my guilty conscience vald read and be rule 
if this my second duty may prove as happy in the recovery of thy kingdom as my first be against a tyrant yet honour thou with the victory i shall account my travel well bestow make head brave as wisdom permit against the enemy for I be come with all speed to let he know that Landgartha be thy queen and only lawful wife be a warrior and will prove so to his prejudice and thy advantage have from her heart notwithstanding thy unkindness absolve thou of all the wrong thou do her 

a gracious language o you god defend i 
from turn altogether fool at this for my 
frail vessel be not able to contain 
the forcible excess of this sweet comfort 
my soul result so strange mount mount up 
that I have much ado to keep from dance 
my nimble spirit elevate my body

before she come you may lose all yourself and we

I be but as other be a poor weak man 
subject to many change against my will 

collect yourself be it but in obedience enter scout 
to your wise and noble queen what news with you 

that Harrold and his brother Eric with 
a mighty power of Dane and german march 
hither with speed doubtless to force a battle 

which we must decline till our best soldier 
come and then we be for they 

lead we from hence 
to guard your work and do not now forget 
your wish aid be so near you your old valour 
and judgement to command 

I hope we shall not exeunt 

our foe have fortify themselves so strong 
with wagon cart huge timber and deep trench 
as it be impossible almost to force they 

which if you do not you will find it a worse task 
to quail Landgartha who fleet be now at sea 
nay hard on land 

the present attempt will not 
perchance prove so dangerous as to the eye 
it seem if we valiant engage 
ourselves in the onset 

let we bold on then 
and to conclude what hitherto we have 
so prosperous achieve I will begin 
and die rather than lose what I have win exeunt 

all be lose beyond recovery they be break 
upon we in and fight like hungry lion 
tear our man to piece that now leave 
in foul disorder 

do you while I charge up 
to give some stop unto their fury rally 
and hearten you the best you may for if 
we can hold out but one full hour the noble 
Landgartha that with speed incredible 
have almost land all her force will be 
with we to mend all again

farewell I hope that we shall meet again exeunt several alarm 

stand traitor 

thou usurper I will stand 
and can afford you other glorious title 
but that I mean not have meet you to 
waste time in word until your foolish sweetheart 
who you will still deceive come to your rescue 
but now I hope you never shall enjoy she 
you know how 

you shall know somewhat from i howsoever

have do this for you now go look to yourself and people 

dear heaven where be I or be this a dream Reyner rise as she beat in Harrold 
it be Landgartha sure o no it be not 
that glory and great miracle of the world 
can not afford such grace to i the mere 
fall dregs of villainy but yet it be she 
the figure of her heavenly face be once 
and still be so imprint in my soul 
as it be impossible I shall forget she 
therefore you god heap all those mountain on i 
which the impious giant lift against you 
or sink i down into the very centre 
that I may never behold she any more

for both I have contemn and my most base 
ingratitude never appear at full

receive the last and mortal blow but then 
give i so sad a look oh love sister 
that life which be her gift if I must keep 
in her displeasure be much worse than death 

sir if you will be rule by i you must not 
express too much those vehement affection 
for she be acquaint but too well already 
with your sad passion and the continuance of it 

see you dear lady in love and wisdom 
esteem that my best course I shall be dumb 
as night calm as the calm evening after 
a stormy day Scania let we follow where she go then exeunt 

after our loss and watch these two night 
I can brother the toil of our journey 
lie so heavy too on my tire body 
but sleep a little though it be dangerous 

my need be no less a little sleep will serve 

let we take it here then the place be solitary 

heaven have decree another day 
shall gain what you have lose your way 
take both as you be force before 
unto the pious emperor 
one of you shall be king who seed 
shall be so too until it all bleed 
then when that issue be extinct 
Norway and Denmark whole precinct 
shall be rule by landgartha line 
and reyner her the power divine 
will for her moral virtue turn 
a christian ere she come to the urn 
yield faith to this for without doubt 
what I have say shall come about Exit Ang then Eric stir and wake Har 

sir you sleep exceed sound pray wake 

I now be fresh enough come let we be go 

dream you nothing while you sleep 

no do you 

methinks I hear a most heavenly music 
and that a angel do appear and wish we 
betake ourselves again to the emperor 
that what we lose another day shall purchase 
and that the fair Landgartha as the reward 
of her moral virtue will be make Christian 
before she die 

though we afford no credit 
unto such dream yet we must steer our course 
that way there be after so great a loss 
no comfort leave where our foe be so strong 

heaven will in time I hope revenge our wrong exeunt 

Come brother Radgee it be now conclude 
we shall never part again 

o dear brother 
I never have a good day on it much less 
a good night since be bar the comfort of your 
sweet conversation you part from i 

nay brother I can howl the same sad madrigal 
too for look you brother we be all so fright 
by those fatfoggy german who man say 
be nothing but flesh and belly that we dare 
allow no time for mirth and drink 

very 
strange that brother for they say themselves be 
exceed good fellow 

just of that seize 

I will tell you more what I hear speak of they 
brother they be sour and never worth the trust 
or honest in their bargain until they 
be drink or at least half drink 

that be as true 
brother as that you and I drink half a score 
flagon yesternight a piece the north wind 
be not so bitter in a morning till he 
have take a buttrum or his wine 

and then 
make as good music as a bagpipe when it be 
full blow what do you think of the Swede brother 

they be not yet altogether so good drinker 
as the german be but well fall to it of late 
which make i suppose brother they will be beat 
out too for beside the king will no more kiss 
the queen Vraca as it be speak but stick 
to be own old comrade be indeed the fair 

yet in my opinion brother his grace 
be marry to both shall do exceed well 
to keep both still sleep betwixt both at the night 
and embrace both by turn what say you brother 

what but to concur with you and for many 
good and convince reason be for example 
the king be keep so warm on both side by 
two such delicate creature it be impossible 
he shall catch cold ay or perchance be trouble 
with cough scyatica or other boneache 
and to have Swealand and Norway at command 
be a matter of no small importance 
you conceive i brother 

Few wise man better 
in part but stand aside themselves be come flourish 

you will not gracious madam thus deceive 
the expectation of your poor and love 
people who whole hope comfort safety nay all 
we can for the present or hereafter call we 
be but benefit derive from the fountain 
of your warm bounty at who goodness yet 
we most rejoice do not then dear empress strike 
sorrow to our late bleed heart that still 
pant and not slow by our former fear 
and the sore stripe we take which but for you 
for ever be incurable and now 
by your forsake of we will fester worse 
than before 

that you need not fear lord Inguar 
for I shall never be want in my care 
and love unto this nation leave here 
the best half of our army now behind we 
to prevent all future mischief 

our dishonour 
in your departure we shall never recover 

my offence which now be my worst affliction 
with what it do occasion all may see 
take origin and issue more of humane 
frailty and foolish pride then want of love 
to you or of desert in you to merit 
a better and more powerful man than I be 
the world only monarch if there be but one 
for which I without your mercy to restore i 
once more unto your heart as to my kingdom 
must spend my day which shall not then be many 
like to a sickly beast without a soul 

my heart shall still receive you but on my word 
the rest of my body you shall not enjoy sir 
I now be gaunt you see 
all though you must not have a feel of it 
and if I do play false my belly will show it 
questionless for I be fruitful if 
I shall be touch 

although but weak madam 
on you and this your kind friend but that I wave 
he for my husband that despise i as 
his honest mate and will have love i for 
byblow therefore enjoy he still for I suppose 
you be a hen that must be tread 

that be more than you know or I hope shall find 

she shall never enjoy i nor have not 
of a long time I will swear if that will serve 

it shall not sir believe it yet never fear 
you shall be arm in the front by i which be 
a wrong this other lady can do you 
if she will 

I will leave that now for you that have 
the able body 

and you the frail mind 
but if you chop word with i thus or insult 
I may for a farewell crack your bird neck 
before we part 

I must not stand so near 
you then she step behind Reyner and hold he betwixt Langartha and herself 

nor I prove any safeguard for you step from betwixt they 
but shall take part with she who I love best 
and have best right unto i 

that you say 
to flatter she and for mere fear but if 
I have you in private I know what you 
will sing and play too if I shall but yield Land run at she and Elsinora step in 

what do you mean 

that I will never have he 
that be resolve 

your resolution 
I must say in that be worse than madness 

I will not quarrel with you aunt yet do admire 
a lady of your know modesty shall be 
so far mistake and in such a cause 

it be you that be mistake I confess 
I be at first a opposite in your love 
unto the king but see you will needs 
yield then your virgin fort unto his highness 
I now will have you take what wife do use 
and let i still live chaste that do profess it 

my aunt say more to i I be sure she do 
all ought to live accord their vocation 
and not preposterous prove alien to it 
nor will it serve to say he tear the bond
