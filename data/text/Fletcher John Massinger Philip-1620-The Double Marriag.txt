prithee to bed to be thus fond be more tedious 
than if I be neglect

of love and duty which I will fall under 
rather than want that care which you may challenge 
as due to my obedience 

I confess

and more deserve my heart best thank then anger 
yet I must tell you sweet you do exceed 
in your affection if you will engross i

of all the beauty nature ever fashion 
or art give ornament to compare to thou 
thus as thou be obedient and love 
I shall contemn and loathe she 

I do believe you

in my assure belief this be unfeigned 
and why this sadness then 

why Juliana 
believe i these my sad and dull retirement 
my often nay almost continue fast 
sleep banish from my eye all pleasure stranger 
have neither root nor growth from any cause 
that may arrive at woman shall thou be 
as chastity forbid false to my bed 
I shall lament my fortune perhaps punish 
thy falsehood and then study to forget thou 
but that which like a never empty spring 
feed high the torrent of my swell grief 
be what my country suffer there be a ground 
where sorrow may be plant and spring up 
though yield rage and womanish despair 
and yet not shame the owner 

I do believe it true 
yet I shall think myself a happy woman 
if in this general and timely mourning 
I may or give to you or else receive 
a little lawful comfort 

thy discretion 
in this may answer for i look on Naples 
the country where we both be bear and breed 
Naples the paradise of Italy 
as that be of the earth Naples that be 
the sweet retreat of all the worthy roman 
when they have share the spoil of the whole world 
this flourish kingdom who inhabitant 
for wealth and bravery live like petty king 
make subject now to such a tyranny 
as that fair city that receive her name 
from Constantine the great now in the power 
of barbarous infidel may forget she own 
to look with pity on our misery 
so far in our calamity we transcend she 
for since this arragonian tyrant Ferrand 
cease on the government there be nothing leave we 
that we can call our own but our affliction 

and hardly those the king strange cruelty 
equal all precedent of tyranny 

equal say you 
he have out go the worst compare to he 
nor Phalaris nor Dionysius 
Caligula nor Nero can be mention 
they yet as king abuse their regal power 
this as a merchant all the country fat 
he whole do engross unto himself 
our oil he buy at his own price then sell they 
to we at dear rate our plate and jewel 
under a feign pretence of public use 
he borrow which deny his instrument force 
the race of our horse he take from we 
yet keep they in our pasture rape of matron 
and virgin be too frequent never man 
yet thank he for a pardon for religion 
it be a thing he dream not offend 

I have hear 
how true it be I know not that he sell 
the bishopric of tarent to a Jew 
for thirteen thousand ducat 

I be present 
and see the money pay the day will leave i 
ere I can number out his impious action 
or what the miserable subject suffer 
and can you entertain in such a time 
a thought of dalliance tear and sigh and groan 
will better now become you 

they indeed be 
the only weapon our poor sex can use 
when we be injure and they may become we 
but for man that be bear free man of rank 
that will be register father of their country 
and to have on their tomb in golden letter 
the noble style of tyrant killer write 
to weep like fool and woman and not like wise man 
to practise a redress deserve a name 
which fit not i to give 

thy grave reproof 
if what thou do desire be possible 
to be effect may well argue it 
as wise as love but if you consider 
with what strong guard this tyrant be defend 
ruffian and malcontent draw from all quarter 
that only know to serve his impious will 
the citadel build by he in the neck 
of this poor city the invincible strength 
nature by art assist give this castle 
and above all his fear admit no man 
to see he but unarm it be death 
for any to approach he with a weapon 
you must confess unless our hand be canon 
to batter down these wall our weak breath mine 
to blow his fort up or our curse lightning 
to force a passage to he and then blast he 
our power be like to you and we like you 
weep our misfortune 

wall of brass resist not 
a noble undertake nor can vice 
raise any bulwrack to make good the place 
where virtue seek to enter then to fall 
in such a brave attempt be such a honour 
that Brutus do he live again will envy 
Were my dead father in you and my brother 
nay all the ancestor I be derive from 
as you in be what you be be all these 
I have rather wear a mourn garment for you 
and shall be more proud of my widowhood 
you die for the freedom of this country 
then if I be assure I shall enjoy 
a perpetuity of life and pleasure 
with you the tyrant live 

till this minute 
I never hear thou speak oh more than woman 
and more to be belove can I find out 
a cabinet to lock a secret in 
of equal trust to thou all doubt and fear 
that scandalize your sex be far from i 
thou shall partake my near and dear counsel 
and further they with thou 

I will be faithful 

know then this day stand heaven propitious to we 
our liberty begin 

in ferrand death 

it be plot love and strong and believe it 
for nothing else can do it it be the thought 
how to proceed in this design and end it 
that make strange my embrace 

curse be she 
that be so indulgent to her own delight 
that for their satisfaction will give 
a stop to such a glorious enterprise 
for i I will not for the world I have be 
guilty of such a crime go on and prosper 
go on my dear lord I love your honour 
above my life nay you my prayer go with you 
which I will strengthen with my tear the wrong 
of this poor country edge your sword oh may it 
pierce deep into this tyrant heart and then 
when you return bathe in his guilty blood 
I will wash you clean with fountain of true joy 
but who be your assistant though I be 
so covetous of your glory that I can wish 
you have no sharer in it Knock 

be not curious 
they come however you command my bosom 
to they I will not have you see 

I be go sir 
be confident and may my resolution 
be present with you Exit 

such a masculine spirit 
with more than woman virtue be a dower 
to weigh down a king fortune 

good day to you enter Brissonet Camillo Ronvere 

you be a early stirrer 

what new face 
bring you along 

if I stand doubt sir 
as by your look I guess it you much injure 
a man that love and true love this country 
with as much zeal as you do one that hate 
the prince by who it suffer and as deadly 
one that dare step as far to gain my freedom 
as any he that breathe that wear a sword 
as sharp as any be 

nay no more comparison 

what you but whisper I dare speak aloud 
stand the king by have mean to put in act too 
what you but cold plot if this deserve then 
suspicion in the best the bold wise 
pursue your own intent I will follow i 
and if I not outstrip you 

be assure sir 
a conscience like this can never be ally 
to treachery 

who dare speak so much 
but one that be like we a sufferer 
and stand as we affect 

you be cozen 
and all undo every intelligencer 
speak treason with like licence be not this 
ronvere that have for many year be train 
in ferrand school a man in trust and favour 
reward too and high 

grant all this 
the thought of what he be be as he be now 
a man disgrace and with contempt throw off 
will spur he to revenge as swift as they 
that never be in favour 

poor and childish 

his regiment be cast that be most certain 
and his command in the castle give away 

that on my knowledge 

gross still what shepherd 
will yield the poor remainder of his flock 
to a know wolf though he put on the habit 
of a most faithful dog and bark like one 
as this but only talk 

yes he have mean too 

I know it to my grief weak man I know it 
to make his peace if there be any war 
between he and his master betray 
our innocent life 

you be too suspicious 
and I have bear too much beyond my temper 
take your own way I will leave you 

you may stay now 
you have enough and all indeed you fish for 
but one word gentleman have you discover 
to he alone our plot 

to he and other that be at his devotion

in my own house I will silence he for ever 
but what be past my help be past my care

for his safety 
I rather fear and as a pageant to 
usher our ruin 

we as torchbearer 
will wait on these but with such art and cunning 
I have convey sharp poniard in the wax 
that we may pass though search through all his guard 
without suspicion and in all his glory 
oppress he and with safety 

it be most strange 

to be effect 

you be doubtful still 

but we resolve to follow he and if you 
desist now virolet we will say it be fear 
rather than providence exeunt 

and so we leave you enter Julian

and let her work the wind begin to whistle 
clap all her streamer on and let she dance

let she bestride the billow till they roar 
and curl their wanton head ho below there 
ho ho within 
Ley her northeast and thrust she missen out 
the day grow fair and clear and the wind court we 
o for a lusty sail now to give chase to 

a stubborn bark that will but bear up to we 
and change a broadside brave 

where be the duke 

I have not see he stir today 

o gunner 
what bravery dwell in his age and what valour 
and to his friend what gentleness and bounty 
how long have we be inhabitant at sea here 

some fourteen year 

by fourteen life I swear then 
this element never nourish such a pirate 
so great so fearless and so fortunate 
so patient in his want in act so valiant 
how many sail of well mane ship before we 
as the bonuto do the fly fish 
have we pursue and scour that to outstrip we 
they have be fain to hang their very shirt on 
what galley have we bang and sink and take 
who only fraught be fire and stern defiance 
and nothing speak but bullet in all these 
how like old neptune have I see our general 
stand in the poop and toss his steel trident 
command both the sea and wind to serve he 

his daughter too which be the honour boatswain 
of all her sex that martial maid

This to I wonder at 
take so many stranger as he do 
he use they with that respect and coolness 
not make prize but only borrow 
what may supply his want nor that for nothing 
but render back what they may stand in need of 
and then part love where if he take 
his countryman that shall be near to he 
and stand most free from danger he sure pay for it 
he drown or hang the man ransack the bark 
then give she up a bonfire to his fortune 

the wrong he have receive from that dull country

we fare the better cheerly cheerly boy 
the ship run merry my captain be melancholy 
and nothing cure that in he but a seafight 
I hope to meet a sail boy and a right one
