now rest in peace this young prince have the order 
to crown his father hope of all the army 
who to be short put all his power to practise 
fashion and draw they up but alas so poor 
so ragged and loose so unsouldiered 
the good duke blush and call unto my father 
who then be general go archus speedy 
and chide the boy before the soldier find he 
stand thou between his ignorance and they 
fashion their body new to thy direction 
then draw thou up and show the prince his error

it be good black blood right weatherproof 
I warrant it 

what a strange pace she have get 

that be but her breed

like to so many seagod charge up to it 
do you see these sword time scythe be never so sharp sir 
nor ever at one harvest mow such handful

when they be draw and be it not sometime 
I swim upon their anger to allay they 
and like a calm depress their fell intention 
they be so deadly sure nature will suffer 
and who be all these glory why their prince
