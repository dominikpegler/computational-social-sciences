Lo gentleman before you all 
in true reclaim form I fall 
henceforth for ever I defy 
the glance of a sinful eye 
wave of fan which some suppose 
trick of fancy tread of toe 
wring of finger bite the lip 
the wanton gate the allure trip 
all secret friend and private meeting 
close bear letter and bawd greeting 
feign excuse to woman labour 
when we be send for to the next neighbour 
take false physic and never start 
to be let blood though sign be at heart 
remove chamber shift bed 
to welcome friend in husband stead 
they to enjoy and you to marry 
they first serve while you must tarry 
they to spend and you to gather 
they to get and you to father 
these and thousand thousand more 
new reclaim I now abhor 

A here be a lesson rioter for you 

I must confess my folly I will down to 
and here for ever I disclaim 
the cause of youth undo game 
chief dice those true outlander 
that shake out beggar thief and pander 
soul waste surfeit sinful riot 
quean evil doctor diet 
apothecary drug surgeon glister 
stab of arm for a common mistress 
ribbon favour ribald speech 
dear perfume jacket pennyless breech 
dutch flapdragon health in urine 
drab that keep a man too sure in 
I do defy you all 
lend i each honest hand for here I rise 
a reclaim man loathe the general vice 

So so all friend the wedding dinner cool 
who seem most crafty prove oft time most fool
