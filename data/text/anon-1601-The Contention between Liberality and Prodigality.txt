the more a man with virtuous deal do himself enure 
the less with worldly business he be molest sure 
which make proof that as turmoil still toss the worldly mind 
so mind exempt from worldly toil desire quiet find 
and chief where the life be lead in virtuous exercise 
there be no toil but ease and contentation to the wise 
but what account how sleight regard be have of virtue here 
by action on this worldly stage most plain do appear 
Men see without most just desert of virtue nought be get 
to fortune therefore fly they still that give all by lot 
and find fortune gift so pleasant sweet and savoury 
they build thereon as if they shall endure perpetual 
but this be sure and that most sure that fortune be unsure 
herself most frail her gift as frail subject to every shower 
and in the end who build most upon her surety 
shall find himself cast headlong down to depth of misery 
then have feel the crafty sleight of fortune fickle train 
be force to seek by virtue aid to be relieve again 
this be the end run how he list thus man of force must do 
unless his life be clean cut off this man must come unto 
in time therefore man may do well to care for his estate 
lest let by extremity repentance come too late 

sir I beseech you speak a good word for i to the prince 
that by her letter I may be commend to some province 
where service be to be have either there to die with fame 
or else to get i somewhat whereon to live without shame 
for beg I can and steal I may not the truth be so 
but need do make the proverb say the old wife to trot for woe 
yet who stark need do pinch at length the devil drive to go 
therefore I beseech you pity his extremity 
that will not make this suit without necessity

then for this time you shall not need to stay 
as for your cause I will remember it 
and see it holpen too as shall be fit 

true if I shall not have care of this man necessity 
I shall both swerve from virtue and from honesty
