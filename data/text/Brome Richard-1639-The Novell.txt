of your posterity and all this by obey 
a wilful father in a lawless marriage 
more fatal I foresee it then ere our state 
of Venice yet produce example for 

o now thou tear my very bowel Piso

my overhasty father to this match 
I shall submit myself the most perfidious 
that ever shadow treachery with love

than I give word or thought but to be thou 

why fly we not to Rome then where you leave she 
and shun the danger of your father plot 
which will not only force you break your faith 
with chaste Victoria but to wed another 
who faith be give already to another 
double damnation it be a way indeed 
to make your child bastard of both fides 

can there no way be find to shun the danger 
of this so hasty intend marriage 
but by my flight and the most certain loss 
of my inheritance 

that will be think on 

stay who come here 

some nightwalker that throw 
ball at their mistress well of all city 
under the universal reign of venery 
this be the civil in what sweet tranquillity 
the subject pass by and salute each other 
stay what grave beast what reverend Gib be that 
in the name of darkness drop out of a gutter 
o age what be thou come to 

pray forbear 

look there Fabritio Venus can it be 

Come you be deceive 

nay now I know I be not 
for by that little love glimpse of light 
that lead he on Fabritio it be thy father 

I pray thou peace 

what will this city come to 
a young man shall not short venture to 
a vault school for fear he jump in the 
same saddle with his father to the danger 
of his old bone enter Francisco and Horatio 
stay here come more this be 
some special haunt sure it be the habitation 
of the Novella late come to town 
which draw the admiration of all 
the rampant gallantry about the city 

they say she be yet a virgin 

and be like 
so to continue still she prove stale fish 
at the rate she be stamp for for she have set 
such a large price upon her new nothing 
that venery and prodigality be at odds 
about she it seem thy father can not bargain 

fie it be not he 

not he peace and stand close 

be she so rare a creature this Novella 

rare above excellent man it be unpossible 
for a painter to flatter she or a poet to bely she 
in aim to augment her beauty for 
I see she that can judge 

now if a man 
be to unkennel the handsome she fox 
in Venice let he follow these dog sure 
she be earth hereabout they have the scent

have beautify this city

Thence only spring the knowledge of her worth 
mark but the price she be cry at two thousand ducat 
for her maidenhead and one month society 

what a way now will that money reach 
in buttockbeef 

Shee be indeed for beauty 
person and price fit only for a prince 
I can think a less man than the duke 
himself must bear she and indeed it be pity 
that she shall sin at less advantage 

why do we then make way to visit she 
by our expense in music 

a wary whoremaster I like he well 
a pennyworth for a penny will be look for 

why Francisco why

in ready money she be yet allow 
to give herself for love if she be please 
who know how well she may affect a man 
as here and there a woman may by chance 
only for virtue that be worth our adventure 
but I wish rather we can purchase she 
at the set price betwixt we for a twelvemonth 
our friendship shall not suffer we to grudge 
at one another good turn

and yet he will deny his son free choice 
and force he marry one he not affect 

that be his drift whereby he may inherit 
from he the same licentiousness and make 
the world acknowledge he the more his son 

but have he make the purchase have he buy 
the famous piece of flesh the rare Novella 

I can unshale a plot 

never doubt but do it then 

my noble Nicolo out with it I say 

I will entreat the favour of this senate

that may be wrought to your advantage 

on 

it be true my master be with the Novella 
draw by the loose desire of wanton flesh 
but such a foul affront he do receive 
as just do provoke his dire revenge 
which he have trust i to execute 

how Nicolo but first what be the affront 

he bargain with she and for some large price 
she yield to be he but in the night 
in the condition bed be lay a moor 
a hideous and detest blackamoor 
which he demand light to please his eye 
as old man use all motive 
discover and enrage forsake the house 
affright and ashamed to ask his coin again 

but seek revenge how how good Nicolo 

thus sir you know what common disrepute 
fall upon man or woman that be find 
converse with the common cityhangman 
that near kindred after such converse 
shun their society as they will do he 
the hangman self so odious be they hold 
except it be those officer allow 
by the statepublic to negotiate with he 

I know it Nicolo but what can follow 

it be plot that the hangman shall go to she 
and be discover with she in such sort 
as her disgrace shall force she fly the city 
and I have undertake to effect it 

it must be then by bribe of the hangman 
and how can thou do that with thy own safety 
thou may be so discover and so hate 

for that observe the politic invention 
of my old master the habit of a zaffi 
one of the inferior minister of justice 
that walk between the senate and their friend 
the executioner of their command 

but what disguise shall shroud the hangman thither who own shape be as horrid as the plague 

the habit of some stranger in the city 
which here be gold to purchase 

thou have inform 
nay more thou have inspire i Nicolo 
I shall find way by this to break the contract 
my father will enforce preserve his credit 
and save the poor Novella from the same 
my father threaten by his own disgrace 
be then but true to i

enough I will trust thou keep the gold thyself 
give i this habit get thyself another 
in all point like it and in that return 
unto my father confident tell he 
the hangman undertake it and at five 
soon in the evening in stranger habit 
he will accost she

I will see it perform 
trust to my word and care and thy reward 

I leave all to you sir and crave my dismission 

what have he do 

most friendly farewell Nicolo Exit Nic 
he have give i plot enough if I but work it 
and it produce not comic sport in the end 
I must subscribe my wit be not my friend

and they that seek you more yet for a time 

your reason sir 

you know I be prefer to you for a bravo 
of long and dear experience I have serve 
six the most famous dame this city breed 
these sixty year none scorn my advice 
by which and their endeavour they grow up 
to purse the price of providence which bestow 
the most in public some in pious use 
purchase they fame almost canonization 
the last and least of they Margarita Emiliana 
found the Augustinian monastery 
I show you late where she have daily prayer 
these woman who successive I serve 
fall not by rash adventure unto all 
great fortune offer but by sound advise 
which keep their body sound and rich their coffer 
be long ere they embrace by which their price 
and beauty grow of great estimation 
my profit in this too be unneglected 
for long suspense and tedious expectation 
bring i more certain fee where if you fall 
immediate to work my work be do 
and your own too perhaps too soon witness the fall 
that pox and poverty have bring on many 
when their youth flame be spend and they reject 
when other of their sisterhood be embrace 
into a wholesome nunnery 

this fellow speak my thought Borgio I think 
you have respect to your particular profit 
in all this wind wariness for my good 

you may conceive it will grieve i that where now 
you have continual new and bounteous suitor 
that yield i fee for the bare sight of you 
you shall in yield to their common use 
send one man cloy away to affright another 
from his approach 

Borgio no more of this 
a dear friend put you to i for who sake 
I hitherto have follow your advice 
in hoist up the price of my virginity 

to such a rate no common purse dare venture 
nor common folk presume to approach the house 

and such as do attempt by offer less 
I have send back with shame as the old youth 
last night for which I thank thou Jacconetta 

I think I cool his grave concupiscence 

and therefore doubt not careful Borgio 
unless I meet a husband by the way 
I will not stoop this month at a less rate 
than the propose sum and your consent 

I thank you more then if you have possess 
i of the value of that sum propose 

he mean her maidenhead i'faith good sir 
the mark be grow out of your old chap or else 
hang i if I believe you by that little 
I know of man 

so now about our business 
some of my visitant I know be near 
wait circumspect Borgio 

you need not doubt i 

there be some hide virtue in this fellow 
or dangerous ill but whether let it be 
as be my birth my purpose shall be free 
make fit my chamber Jaconet but first 
give i my lute and set i for the sign 
o what I mean to be the fame Novella 

now Borgio how speak your muster roll 
what be you full 

I have a army royal 
of princely spirit ready for encounter 

but one at once good Borgio 

I have encamp they each in several quarter 
here lie the no less politic than stout 
italian force and there your sprightly french 
here the brave Spaniard there the German bold 
here the polonian and Sclavonian there 
persian and grecian 

pray thou hold no more 

it be not your house can hold will I admit they 
one of each several nation will throng in 
to make his battery on your virgin fort 
the rich piazza on her great mart 
boast not more nation nor St mark himself 
the understanding of more language 
than I can I find houseroom can receive 
to be make one by your interpretation 
oh what a dare glass be sparkle beauty 
fetch ambition from above the pitch 
of tower eagle or skytouching lark 
down with a glance into the net of love 

prithee speak near home who have thou house 

I have cull from the pack a special prince 
four glitter gallant one of Italy 
for our dear country sake but then a monsieur 
a jovial Frenchman all of flame and spirit 

I shall not dare to meddle with his glory 
for fear I fall with Semele who next 

a Spaniard next that to adorn his pride 
wear a epitome of both the Indies 

I see his punctuality pass by 

and do you note his stiff reservedness 
he dare not cough for break of his chain 
but then there be a Dutchman Cargo lustick 
a jolly strong chinned German princely bear 
a landsgrave at the least who very bluntness 
promise more than the sharpset italian 
the fiery Frenchman or the doughty Diego 
in all their eager pursuit 

that man Burgio 
you have bestow they all in several room 

o like fierce beast from scent of one another 

then first in fair requital of the music 
I do imagine some of they bestow 
on i this morning ere my love appear 
to feed their eye let music feast their ear 

why not i lady stand not I as fair 
and fit for your embrace as any man 

yes sir it be grant and as acceptable 
I yield to none 

it be but to try my courtship I presume 
that you put on this coyness and to draw 
more ample testimony of affection 
by protestation prayer compliment 
the weak ceremony due to love 
mere noise and liplabour with loss of time 
I think with scorn upon such poor expression 
and be above the art of amourist 
that cringe and creep by weak degree of love 
to kiss the hand the cheek the lip then cry 
oh divine touch then smirk and then embrace 
then nuzzle in the Elysium of your bosom 
and be entrance mean fit for dull spirit 
to gather heat and strength of appetite 
my desire speak in love true dialect 
and from my heart inflame you may perceive 
love fire rage in my eye enough 
to melt to yieldingness a freeze breast 
in this I talk too much I find you yield 

and I myself too blame 

let we retire then 

mistake i not good signior keep your distance 
I blame myself to let you overween 
by my long silence that immodesty 
to be in i that may embolden you 
to your and my dishonour pray desist 
and let the friendly welcome you have find 
persuade your fair construction 

be this earnest 

yes in sooth be it 

I will be plain then 
what make you here in the smockfair precious mistress 
or why these dress these perfume and painting 
do you wear the habit of our courtesan 
and by their art call gazer to your beauty 
full of high hope and flame of ardent love 
thus to delude and make they witness 
of a cold seem chastity what new art 
be this it can be to get a husband 

nor a child neither sir that be less 

that be soon believe yet no disparagement 
to your expert sufficiency in the trade 
for the best carpenter make few chip 
there be very few of all your function fruitful 
yet some there be approve man at arm 
famous in public service and a many 
good handy craftsman in the arsenal 
breed by this bounteous city from such mother 
that never can boast their father and as many 
daughter if they prove worthy in their feature 
succeed their active mother in their fortune

daughter of some patrician but in you

you may intend by this in take on you 
the habit and the name of courtesan 
and first to set a price so far beyond 
the strength of any ordinary mean 
and then to show a carriage that may strike

shall not go down with a young wench and one 
of the profession you pretend to be of 
before cold iron methinks most unnatural 
think better yet before you utter further 

Indeed I may not 

well well on then 

it be true I be indeed a mere pretender 
to the profession you suppose i of

my father noble of the candiani 
however decay in fortune ere he die

nor lose I honour by it for the strictness 
of our italian censure give a virgin 
that hold familiarity with any man 
by way of marriage treaty and then forsake 
lose in repute she be no honest woman 
until that man do vindicate her honour 

but shall he find you here what be his censure

have wrought i to and shall restore i firm 
on my first basis or exchange a life
