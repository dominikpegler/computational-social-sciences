and with their sulphur vapour choke thou ere thou 
come at the gallows 

Stretch not my patience Mahomet 

termagant that will stretch thy patience

this morning when we receive the sacrament 

slave know thou this it be a appendix to the letter 
but the great temptation be hide within 
I will scour thy gorge like a hawk thou shall swallow thy 
own stone in this letter they bustle 
seal and deliver in the presence of

o violent villain be not thy hand hereto 
And write in blood to show thy rage lust 

spice of a new halter when you go a range thus like

what be a cuckold learn of i 
few can tell his pedigree 
nor his subtle nature construe 
bear a man but die a monster

before I will prove a cuckold I will endure a winter pilgrimage 
in the freeze zone 
go stark naked through Muscovia where the climate be 
degree cold than ice

love shall marry jealousy 
since man best of life be fame

when it be in a woman keep 
let not Argos eye be sleep 
the pox be unto pander give 
by the better power of heaven 
that contain pure chastity 
and each virgin sovereignty

like missermis cheat of the brack 
we will make this night the day fair joy befall
