hem hem hem a pox on our jailor etc 

So now they be tune their pipe o the religion of these greek they sing and drink down the sun and then they sing and drink he up again some drunken hymn I warrant you towards now in the praise of their great huge roll tunbelly god Bacchus as they call he let we hearken a little 

wondrous good i'faith these fetter swan chant it most melodious before their death sure there be a great deal of pleasure in be hang for I have observe it ever since I be a little one that they always sing before they go to it but here be that will spoil your voice my friend 

who be there 

your friend at a dead lift your landlord Molops 

now grand commissioner of fate what will thou have heir apparent to Pluto 

Come forth and if you can endure to read here be a persian line in my hand will instruct you 

guardian of rag and vermin protector of halfbreeches and no shirt what be thy rascalship pleasure 

good word sir good word I be your destiny do you not see your thread of life here 

yes yes it be of thy wife one twist good Molops I know the promotion of your family she come from the weberrantry of highwayinkle to the domestic turn and wind of home breed hemp and thence get a threehalfpenny legacy at the departure of every wrong sinner 

and as for thyself have not that weighty bulk of thy crack so many gibbet that the king begin to fear his forest thou have never be preserve to whiffle plague as thou usher we to the bar and take away the judge stomach as often as they come to eat upon life and death and celebrate the funeral of distress gentleman 

you die man may be impudent by your place but I will wish you to compose your countenance and your manner both for the king be come to visit you 

what make thou here then though I easy believe thou have a ambition to be see in good company yet prithee be go and do discredit we the king love no garbagetub 

the king shall be inform of the foul word you give his officer 

why what can he do he will let we go and conquer we again will he 

but good honest landlord what be the king intent to honour we with his royal visit 

to assign we perhaps some three or four hundred stripe adays a piece to take down my landlord body and make he in case to suffer what he have be long adjudge to 

no sauciness it be to make one of you king 

then sauciness know your master 

be not mistake it be not any way to honour you but to make himself sport for you must know that it be the custom of the persian king after a conquest to take one of the captive and adorn he with all the robe of majesty give he all privilege for three full day that he may do what he will and then be certain lead to death 

will he allow so long I will give my life at any time for one day royalty it be space enough to new mould a kingdom his majesty use we wondrous reasonable I will as lief deal with he as any man I know but who be to have our clothes sirrah when we have do 

it be a small fee that the state have entail upon my place an it please you 

by my troth guess so I be wonder how their courtier can go so brave with so little mean 

well what must be must be I be afraid I shall have die a silly foolish old animal call virgin but now have at one of the lady ere I go I have a strong desire to leave some posterity behind i I will not have the house of the Stratocles decay for want of issue 

if I have the fortune of it I will revel it all night king they say ought not to sleep for the good of the people 

sirrah jailor see you send mistress turnkey your wife to take we up whore enough and be sure she let none of the young student of the law forestall the market 

peace the king approach stand in your rank orderly and show your breed and be sure you blow nothing on the lord 

be these the fair and the handsome 
among all the captive 

there be one more which I set apart a good personable fellow but he be wondrous heavy and bookish and therefore I think he unfit for any honour 

go call he forth there be none of all these have 
a forehead for a crown their blood run thick 
as if it will blot a sword 
see there come one 
arm with a serious and majestic look 
as if he will read philosophy to a king 
we have conquer something now what read thou there 

I believe he be con a hymn against the good time 

it be a discourse of the nature of the soul 
that show the vicious slave but the well incline 
free and their own though conquer 

thou do speak 
as if thou be victorious not Arsamnes 

I not deny your conquest for you may 
have virtue to entitle it you but otherwise 
if one of strange and ill contrive desire 
one of a narrow or intemperate mind 
prove master of the field I can say 
that he have conquer but that he have have 
a good hand of it he have get the day 
but not subdue the man victory be 
not fortune gift but the deserve purchase 

who do thou call deserve 

he who dare 
die next his heart in cold blood he who fight 
not out of thirst or the unbridle lust 
of a flesh sword but out of conscience 
to kill the enemy not the man who when 
the laurel plant on his brow even then 
under that safeprotecting wreath will not 
contemn the thunderer but will 
acknowledge all his strength derive and in 
a pious way of gratitude return 
some of the spoil to heaven in sacrifice 
as tenant do the first fruit of their tree 
in a acknowledgement that the rest be due 

true tell i be thou then to pay thy vow 
what will thou sacrifice the best or worst 

the best unto the best if I have destine 
a ox unto the altar he shall be 
fair and well feed for the deity do not love 
the maim or misshape because it be 
a thing so different from himself deformity 
be one of nature trespass he shall 
be crown then and conduct solemn 
that my religion may be specious 
it be stealth else not devotion 

brave say 
but it be pity thou have reason all this while 
against thyself for our religion do 
require the immolation of one captive 
and thou have prove that he be best bellow 
that best deserve to be spare 

I can 
tell you the god have neither appetite 
nor entrails that they do not hunger after 
your cookery of sacrifice and that 
a grain of incense or a piece of gum 
if offer with devotion may redeem 
a destine hecatomb but this will be 
to deprecate my fate which by your sun 
your sun that do require i I expect 
with the same mind as I will do my nuptial 

and so it shall come thy shape and virtue do 
enrich and furnish thou for heaven I will 
or thou have flee or I not conquer 
adorn he with robe but thou must swear 
first to be faithful to the state 

I swear 
come from the dungeon to the throne 
to be a king and straight be none 
reign then a while that thou may be 
fit to fall by majesty 

so beast for sacrifice we feed 
first they be crown and then they bleed 
wash with thy blood what war have do 
offensive to our God the sun 
that as thou fall we may see 
he please and set as red as thou 
enjoy the glory then of state 
while pleasure ripen thou for fate 

so beast etc 

now then Cratander I do here indulge thou 
all the prerogative of majesty 
for three full day which be expire that then 
thou may fall honourable I intend 
to strike the blow myself 

I neither take 
new courage from the power nor suffer new 
fear from the death that wait it both be thing 
that have two ear by which they may be take 
so that they be indifferent in themselves 
and only good or bad as they be order 
off with their shackle sirrah you my lord 
take order they be quick well attire 
that they may come to court and do we service 
it be next of all our royal pleasure that 
battle be reinforce by the next sun 
to make our conquest perfect all be not safe 
till the snake leave to threaten with his tail 
Oure reign be short and business much be speedy 
our counsel and our deed must have one birth 

if you will make use of any ornament I have a couple of jackchain at your service come gentleman please you to follow I will give you ease of your iron sudden 

sirrah be quick that my foot may be at liberty to kick thou 

whether tend the mind of this ambitious wretch 
he have think so hasty and so large as if 
he will overrun the whole world in a breath 

I like the courage of the man methinks 
he have give a taste how worthy he be of 
a long kingdom 

you will obey he then 

I do it obey 
he but the king as they that pay their vow 
unto the deity shroud in the image 

true it be the king will he shall be obey 
but he be a slave the man look personable 
and fit for action but he be a slave 
he may be noble virtuous generous all 
but he be still a slave 

as if the sully 
must turn all pure mettle into dross 
or that a jewel may not sometime be 
in the possession of a private man 

what you too for the rise sun my lord 
though it be but a meteor cast from the true one 
if that the conquer hart must lead the lion 
I will teach my wish to run thwart unto 
that large success you look for 

be my fear 
no omen to the kingdom o you god 
but I suspect this comic folly will 
sport our free monarchy into a nation 
of cheat slave but peace the queen 

we two 
will go and see his carriage 

do my lord 
and because you wish his state so well pray see 
the slave provide of their clothes 

you have see 
this threeday king my lord I can sport 
at the misery of man methinks I feel 
a touch of pity as often as I view he 
how do you think he will bear his state 

as schoolboy 
in time of misrule look big a while and then 
return deject to the rod 

I wonder 
no woman be choose queen for company 
these male wit be but gross and sluggish faith 
you will see a delicate comedy if that 
a she wit may but imp his reign 

o madam 
your sex be too imperious to rule 
you be too busy and too stir to 
be put in action your curiosity 
will do as much harm in a kingdom as 
a monkey in a glassshop move and remove 
till you have break all 

thing than it seem 
be very brittle that you dare not trust we 

your closet and your senate will be one 
you will gossip at the counciltable where 
the grand contrivance of some fine posset 
will be a state affair 

I never know 
but this one difference yet betwixt we and you 
your folly be more serious your vanity 
strong and thick weave and your counsel 
about the raze of a fort or city 
contrive as we about a mess of spoonmeat 
so that you laugh and be laugh at again 

I hope you do but exercise your wit 
be not at sharp 

we will venture how he will 
foil or bare point we care not 

cease the strife 
how be this Cratander qualify my lord 
what virtue have he 

no great store of virtue 
he be a tough fellow one that seem to stand 
much on a resolute carelessness and have 
a spice of that unnecessary thing 
which the mysterious call philosophy 
here come a couple can inform you better 
they have observe the thing 

my lord what think you 
of this new king what do he do what be he 

he be one that know and dare preserve his own 
honour and other too a man as free 
from wrong any as himself he bear 
a kingdom in his look a kingdom that 
consist of beauty season with discretion 
his grace be virile and comely too 
grave and severe delight so temper 
the softness of his other pleasure that 
a settle full content do thence arise 
and whole take up the beholder thought 

why then he will turn the scene we do expect 
something that will have save we the labour 
of read playbook and lovestory 

see 
how you be mistake madam he do carry 
all thing with such a state and yet so free 
from a insult pride that you will conceive 
judgement and power put into the scale 
and neither overpoise while he show 
rather that he can rule then that he will 

the afflict never want praise o how false 
do the eye of pity see the only way 
to make the foul seem gracious be to be 
within the ken of death he that ever while 
will have be think a monster be now 
condemn to die be think a hero 

Truly 
I think you have not yet be near your death 

I have be but seldom with your ladyship 

away let we go and view again he promise 
something that be not sport if he do well 
and keep his virtue up until his fall 
I will pay a good wish to he as he be go 
and a fair mention of he when he be go 

how do our new king bear his royalty 

if he go still on thus his three day folly 
will fill your annal 

he be grow the talk 
and sight of all the court he have eye chain to he 
and some say heart nor be they mean one such 
as he may steal without be miss but those 
the theft of who turn sacrilege 

I hope 
Atossa be not in the roll he dare not 
be favour by my queen 

her pure affection 
be sacred as her person and her thought 
soar above the reach of common eye 
be like those better spirit that have nothing 
of earth admix but yet look down upon 
those number of inhabitant and where 
they see a worthy mind oppress vouchsafe 
at least to help with pity 

do she then 
seem to compassionate his fortune we 
must watch his action narrow 

he may 
grow insolent else past remedy but yet 
your majesty have a prevent eye 
he may when that his channel be full discharge 
his stream on all that be round he rush forth 
with a strong headlong torrent as mischievous 
as uncontrollable the ungrateful water 
choke even that which give they life but yet 
you can kill evil by first see they 

all this have take up but one ear only 
the other and the soft be reserve 
religion and your word which equal 
as that be bind be both pass for three day 
to cut he off before be to abridge 
your triumph and devotion 

he must live 
and reign his time prescribe but he must not 
perform the action he intend let then 
all the delight and pleasure that a slave 
admire in king be offer though a hundred 
still watchful eye beset his head yet there 
be one way leave music may subtle creep 
and rock his sense so that all may sleep 

perish their table and themselves a throne 
may stand without those tumult of delight 
that wait on big and pompous luxury 
I will cross their expectation and quite banish 
all that their weak mind do think delight 
king pleasure be more subtle than to be 
see by the vulgar they be man but such 
as never have any dregs or if they have 
drop they as they be draw up from out 
the grovel press of mortal to offend 
beyond the reach of law without control 
be not the nature but the vice of power 
and he be only great that dare be good 

he wear a serious look still we may hope 
as soon to calm a tempest with a song 
as soften he 

beast and hard rock have both 
be move and by his countryman let we try 
that we may some way sir express our service 
unto you with intent you may not feel 
bare honour only without the delight 
we have provide you a taste of our 
best persian music 

that be a innocent pleasure 
sphere make it and god hear it 

boy come in 

your last new song that which I give you sirrah 

see yonder where he sit let we stand and see 
how he will behave himself the lord have vow 
to try he to the utmost 

I begin 
to fear that he be mortal 

Come begin 

I do expect some solemn hymn of the 
great world beginning or some brave captain 
deserve deed extol in lofty number 
these soft subject grate our ear but what 
be these my lord she minstrel

which we out of that duty which we owe you 
think a fit present that you may not want 
any delight that Persia yield 

I have 
no humane thought about i now forbear

these yet methinks may melt you 

if you will 
needs put yourselves to the trouble of procurer 
bring i a kingdom in one face or show i 
a people in one body than you may 
happy work on my affection 
there I dare pour myself into embracement 
lose myself in a labyrinth of joy 
as it be you only make i cold by 
surround i with these your hostile flame 

I hope you do conceive it our affection 
and duty to your sceptre 

let i ask you 
be it not enough you try i with those bait 
of wine and meat cull from the spoil of nature 
but you must bring vice in another fashion 

will you then let your day pass sluggish 
and reap no pleasure from your power 

it be one 
to punish such offender as yourselves 
that will abase your honour to so vile 
and abject a employment if you offer 
the like again you shall perceive that king 
how short so ever their reign be have long hand 
this act whatever you style it be flat treason 
our honour be abuse in it o the forehead Prax and Mas steal out and leave the two woman with he 
of woman once grow impudent that these 
can stand so long and hear their infamy 
debate quiet expect when 
they shall be call to their reproach what flee 
And leave the prey behind to tempt i ho 
who wait without convey these wicked creature 
unto the jailor Molops give he charge 
to use they as he will do enemy 
my country will twice suffer shall I yield 
unto their vice too but Greece be not 
only preserve in i have they perhaps 
carry these creature to the wild knot

when all eye see it a blemish be a monster 
pure virtue then and thou fair honour give i 
leave to contemplate on your beauty let as he be muse Atos from above throw he a gold coin 
the strength of my imagination dwell 
upon the sight of your divinity 
what more temptation yet ha whence from who 
the heaven I hope do drop down folly too 
no arm out of the cloud a chain why this 
be but a exprobration of my late 
distress fortune it be rich yet and royal 
I can be the wealth of any but the throne 
fall out what will I will wear it till I know 
from whence it come and if it prove a mettle 
that some foul drossy mind can not endure 
shall long dwell with it I then will cast it 
with as much scorn and anger from my shoulder 
as now I do receive it with admiration 

look there he walk alone consider 
let we to he while we may good day Craetander 

good Hippias Photion you be welcome how 
dare you trust yourselves in a enemy court 

we pass disguise to see what will become 
of our affair and be the future state 
of Ephesus depend on you be come 
only to give you notice of it for 
we do presume you be not to be entreat 
to do we good 

Alas I be not after 
the period of three day this make the time 
which even now I think a age seem short 
and too contract for my desire 

when you 
shall raise your country struggle in the dust 
the time be short and too contract it be long 
enough to lead a army out against it 
to crush those relic of a halflife that 
her doubtful body faint breath you may 
with that right hand spin three day to the space 
of many olympiad 

what be your meaning 

have we endure the hate and feel the fury 
of violent Arsamnes so long have we 
suffer his sword until it do grow blunt 
and rather break then wound have you try 
the weight and strictness of the persian chain 
so long and ask we now what be your meaning 
Come come Cratander I can chide you but 
that I believe you only hide the good 
that you intend your country that it may not 
be disappoint you may safe tell we 
you will betray the persian into our hand 
that we may gather force and prepare 
against their come 

oh be this your errant 
here take your chain again it can bind 

however do exprobrate our poverty 
though all our wealth have be the persian spoil 

why you throw it in before you to make way 
unto your suit 

be it not lawful to 
salute the persian mockking think you unless 
we bring a gift I will think the name of Ephesus 
have privilege our access think on the honour 
the long continue honour that you shall 
receive at home think on those numerous tear 
that you shall wipe away from flow eye 
at the first sight of liberty 

your approach 
will entice city out of house the age 
and the young too the matron and the virgin 
all mingle in a bless confusion 
will in a solemn full procession come 
and with that great religion bring you in 
as if their captive god be bring they back 
Come then a king home that go out a slave 

I be so still no soon do I come 
within the persian wall but I be they 
and since good Hippias this power have only 
add one link more to the chain I be 
become Arsamnes instrument I have swear 
faith to his sceptre and himself and must 
ask his leave ere I do betray his country 

you be free enough against we o the justice 
of a unnatural son yet ask yourself 
aught that be ratify that be do by force 

as if the valiant can be force by any 

you shall not change your fortune you shall only 
pass to another empire and for that 
right may be violate 

empire be 
desire for glory be all wickedness then 
far absent for in that there can be none 

you be resolve to reason yourself then 
into a measure unthankfulness what can 
hinder this good to your country but yourself 
fear thou the thunder and the god the anger 
of the grecian power will be upon thou if 
thou not restore they to their seat on then 
thou undertake their cause thou fight their war 

I can tell what power you pretend 
tell i of justice and fidelity 
these be the grecian god 

be then thy name 
blast to all posterity and let 
our wretched nephew when then soul shall labour 
under the persian yoke curse thou and say 
this slavery we owe unto Cratander 

pray stay I will go with you and consider 
how be I straighten life be short unto i 
and the good man end ought still to be a business 
we must die do something lest perhaps 
we lose our death we must not yet do ill 
that we misplace not action if I strike 
on this hand I be a parricide if on that 
the same brand wait i too how do I tremble 
like to the doubtful needle betwixt two lodestone 
at once incline unto both and neither 
here piety call i there my justice stop i 
it be resolve faith shall consist with both 
and age fame after my death shall tell 
betwixt two sin Cratander do do well 

set a watch at the door to keep out sleep 
he be mortal that offer to betray so much weakness 
as to wink here Archippus 

may not a man wink without mortality 
when he let it go down here Stratocles 

I do state wink in that case divine 

Come thou uneven lump thou heap of sin in proof we will liquor thy key open thy cage and give thy meager tenant a play day rascal bring the jar near as I hope for fortune I think my soul will pass into a frog now for a hundred throat to thou Molops 

you grecian I think have sponge in your maw it be but set your hand to your side and squeeze yourselves and present you drink as much as before 

off with thy cup landlord and talk not we learn it from the teat fool 

have at thou Archippus 

I do not like these health at random let we have a sober methodical order for a while 

what shall we drink by dice then and let fortune name the heir to the cup 

or shall we drink our mistress name and soak it alphabetical 

if we drink name let not the letter pass for single one but as they will in number I do pronounce Alpha no letter till it begin to multiply 

I never think drink such a mystery before a blockhead can it be drink I see 

right shallow brain can never attain to it that make your fool and your old govern philosopher continue so sober still the veget artist and the vigorous poet who brain be full and forge still will straight get a pleasant madness from that that will but warm those cold rheumatic sage who nose always drop like stillsnout 

the noble drink methinks be the posture 

let we have they 

bring the pot in play but where be the wench and the music you promise we good Molops 

for wench the town will not yield any at this time and I dare not venture my single wife among you all for fiddler I have provide they they stand ready without 

call they in sweet Molops 

well what shall those rascal play while we drink the posture 

the battle by all mean 

strike up the battle then think yourselves all in service now and do as I do 
take your bow gentleman and make a stand they take their pot in their left hand they take their cup in their right hand and fill they blow off the froth 
Right draw your shaft now and knock they 
very good now smooth your feather 
well do present and take aim 
here be to thou Leocrates 

have towards thou Philotas 

to thou Archippus 

here Molops 

have at you fiddler 

now draw your bow and let loose all 

the other charge good fellow soldier 

let we have a song between and then have at you 

fiddler employ your throat and sing a while you shall drink with they after 

sing that which I make in the prison it be seasonable enough 

well say now the other charge to the honour of Cratander 

I feel a rumble in my head as if the Cyclops be forge thunder in my brain but no matter give it i our ancient Orpheus say it perpetual drunkenness be the reward of virtue 

which the most vicious have must I still meet 
some thing must grieve i more than your misfortune 
the chain and Fetter be your innocence 

we do fire temple sir we kill no father 
nor mother it be not incest to be merry 

but to be drink be all do but consider 
if that at least you can how Greece itself 
now suffer in you thus say they the grecian 
do spend their night your vice be esteem 
the rite and custom of your country while 
the beastly revel of a slave or two 
be make the nation infamy your wreathe 
blush at your ignominy what praise be it 
when it shall be say Philotas stand up still 
after the hundred flagon when it be know 
he do not so in war you be now just fit 
to reach the spartan boy sobriety 
be all good principle wash out however 
be without vice if not virtuous 
that I shall have authority to command 
vice but not forbid they I will put you 
once more into his charge but that you will 
make even the dungeon yet more infamous 

gentleman hear i cratander Ex Crat 
speak well and like a good commonwealthsman 

out you dissemble rascal be you of cratander faction 

good gentleman do kick i I shall leave all my drink behind i if you do 

must we still thus be check we live not under 
a king but a pedagogue he be insufferable 

troth he be so proud now he must be kill to make a supper for the immortal cannibal that there be no ho with he 

I never think he will have be either so womanish as to have be chaste himself or so uncivil as to keep we so but he talk of lie with surprise city and commit fornication with victory and make mar pimp for he 

these be the fruit of learning we suffer all this mere because he have a little familiarity with the devil in philosophy and can conjure with a few notion out of Socrates 

in good troth I take it very scurvy at his hand that he will not let i deserve hang I will thought to have do all the villainy in the world and leave a name behind i but he be severe forsooth and cry out virtue mistress virtue 

disease take she I never know any good she do in commonwealth yet I wonder how he dare be so impudent as to be good in a strange place 
do not you mark his rhetoric cast at i 
I be the butt the shot at what praise if it 
when it shall be say Philotas stand up still 
after the hundred flagon when it be know 
he do not so in war mere mere upbraid 
and shall Philotas this this from Cratander 

whence this deep silence be you sacrifice 
to your dumb god of Greece where be your cap 
your love your madness 

do not ravish i 
I will cry out a rape if that you come 
within twelve foot of i we must be modest 
modest an it please the god 

fie fie we look you shall 
have leave at least a dozen of great belly 
a piece behind you upon every tribe 
where be your spirit have I be in your case 
nature ere this have be invert but 
you think on your last end as if the world 
be to expire with you 

o we must walk 
discreet look as careful to our step 
as if we be to dance on rope with egg 
under our foot we have leave off shackle 
to be worse fetter 

can a breast of large 
and ample thought tame endure the ring 
and be lead quiet by the patient nose 
when licence be religion one who dull 
and sluggish temper be call wisdom one 
who indiscretion kill with some formality 
as quicksilver with fast spittle do pass 
for a grave govern garb this heavy lump 
dull all your active fire 

you understand not 
for to what end be liberty indulge 
to be oppress by a severe rule 
one new take from among yourselves 
to make your state worse by his tyranny 
but you show what you can endure 

by heaven 
we do enslave ourselves we can be as free 
as be Cratander though not so malicious 

you be as thing of nought with he for tell i 
when call he Stratocles to council when 
ask he Leocrates his advice Philotas 
Archippus name exclude from his thought 
but when he mean to show that he have anger 

what star be thou bear under Stratocles 

that which all governor of markettown be 
some lazy planet I believe 

thou be it wont 
to exercise upon a throat or two 
to keep thy hand in ure now show thyself 
let we slit this grave weasand 

now I see 
you have some man about you now your blood 
run as they shall do high and full you sleep 
mere till now if that Cratander shall 
quit score with nature ever his time be out 
the king must choose again the dead you know 
never go for sacrifice 

must one of we 
piece up his reign then 

there be no other way 
the god themselves require it 

my haunch quake 
as if that Molops be to season they 
and put they straight in past for the great god 

whoever 
succeed he shall allow the rest whatever 
nature or art can yield nothing shall be 
unlawful but to sleep and mumble prayer 

agree agree 

agree agree 

agree agree 

then fill i out a oath 
all I presume will bind themselves with this 
good common loser of all care but what 
do tend to liberty to do the like 

the motion be worthy crown the goblet then 

will it be his blood by truth herself the offspring 
and child of wine Cratander die ever half 
the glass of his short tyranny run out 
This then to the infernal god power some on the ground 
and this 
to our just anger god as great as they he drink 
good omen so the thicken stream run black 
it be blood methinks I drink it be laziness 
to say he shall be dead he be dead already 
drink and prepare for pleasure 

liberty 

he must be more than man that gain it back 
without my will 

your justice must restore it 
will your severe majesty triumph 
with soft spoil of a lady cabinet 

as I will not feign favour and belie 
a jewel or a twist to gain the name 
of creature or of servant unto any 
so by your beauty for if Persian may 
swear by their sun I well may swear by that 
where honour be transmit in a true 
mysterious gage of a immaculate mind 
I will defend it as some sacred relic 
or some more secret pledge drop down from heaven 
to guard i from the danger of the earth 

but in that 
you make it common you bereave it of 
all that you call divinity 

he that vaunt 
of a receive favour ought to be 
punish as sacrilegious person be 
because he do violate that sacred thing 
pure spotless honour but it may be see 
and yet not prostitute I will not smother 
my joy and make my happiness a stealth 

how your thought flatter your deceive fancy 
into a state that when you leave to think 
die as your thought that keep it up what be it 
that you call joy and happiness 

I must 
confess I have no merit who just heat 
may extract aught from you call love yet when 
I do consider that affection 
can look virtuous on any thing 
that be resplendent but a subtle image 
pure reflect thence must needs arise 
and pay that look again I do take leave 
to say the careful deity provide 
that love shall never be so unhappy as 
to want his brother 

why I never spend 
a sigh for you you never have a kiss 
nor the reversion of one yet 

such love 
be but Love idol and these soft one that 
confine it to a kiss or a embrace 
do as the superstitious do of old 
contract the godhead into a bull or goat 
or some such lustful creature be it far 
be it far from i to think wherever I see 
clear stream of beauty that I may presume 
to trouble they with quench of my thirst 
where a full splendour where a bright effusion 
of immaterial beam do meet to 
make up one body of perfection 
I shall account myself injurious 
unto that deity which have let down 
himself into those ray if that I shall 
draw nigh without a awful adoration 
which my religion pay to you but be 
you like not the devotion be content 
to slight the sacrifice but spare the altar 

I be so far from ruine that breast 
in which there live a spark of chaste honour 
that I will hazard this so prize a trifle 
which man call life that I may live there still 
and prove that love be but a engine of 
the careful power invent for the safety 
and preservation of afflict goodness 
conceive not hence a passion burn towards you 
for she that speak like woman be a queen 

I can distinguish betwixt love and love 
between flame and good intent nay between flame 
and flame themselves the gross now fly up 
and now fall down again still covet new 
matter for food consume and consume 
but the pure clear flame that shoot up always 
in one continue pyramid of lustre 
know no commerce with earth but unmixed still 
and still aspire upward if that may 
be call aspire which be nature have 
this property of immortality 
still to suffice themselves neither devour 
and yet devour and such I knowledge you 
on which I look as on refine idea 
that know no mixture or corruption 
be one eternal simpleness that these 
shall from the circle of their chaste glory 
dart out a beam on i be far beyond 
all humane merit and I may conclude 
they have only their own nature for a cause 
and that they be good they be diffusive too 

your tongue have speak your thought so noble that 
I bear a pity to your virtue which 
ere night shed poppy twice over the weary world 
must only be in these two register 
annal and memory can you but contrive 
how you may live without a injury 
unto religion you shall have this glory 
to have a queen your instrument 

there be nothing 
can woo my heart unto a thought of life 
but that your presence will be want to i 
when I be shut up in silence yet I have 
a strong ambition in i to maintain 
a equal faith betwixt Greece and Persia 
that like a river run betwixt two field 
I may give growth and verdure unto both 
Praxaspes and masiste potent lord 
be both against my design so that I shall not 
obtain a army for they think I have 
that vile mind in i to betray this kingdom 
to which I have swear fidelity when by 
yourself by all that be good my intent be only 
to perfect great Arsamnes conquest and 
in that be beneficial to my country 
in which if that your majesty will descend 
to act a part after the scene be shut 
I will down to Elysium with a joyful mind 
and teach our grecian poet your bless name 
and virtue for a everlasting song 

be it against myself I will not deny it 
walk in I will follow you in great design Ex Crat 
valour help much but virtuous love do more 

wase not enough that you peruse his action 
and surfeit your eye upon his folly 
see and see again but you must cast he 
a chain a emblematic chain 

it be not 
the veil that hinder the quick busy eye 
from read over the face but modesty 
he have a weak defence that do entrust 
the preservation of a chaste love 
unto a silken cloud 

I stand not much 
upon the commerce of your eye but it be 
your chain your favour that do you think it be fit 
a queen shall send one link unto a slave 

do not the sun the sun which yet you worship 
send beam to other than yourself yet those 
which dwell on you lose neither light nor heat 
come not thence less vigorous or less chaste 
will you seal up a fountain or confine 
the air unto your walk will you enjoin 
the flower to cast no smell but as you pass 
love be as free as fountain air or flower 
for it stand not in a point it be large and may 
like stream give verdure to this plant that tree 
nay that whole field of flower and yet still run 
in a most faithful course towards the bosom 
of the love ocean 

but when you divert 
and break the stream into small rivulet 
you make it run more weak then when it keep 
unite in one channel 

if it branch 
into a small twine here and there 
the water be not lose nor do it quit 
the former name this be not to destroy 
but to enlarge the stream do it dry up 
and leave the fountain destitute indeed 
you will reason to be angry 

but what shall make you 
present he with a gift you may have smother 
a good opinion of he in your breast 
as some digress stream flow under ground 
and so have rest but you show it now 
and make the world partaker 

who will stifle 
a honest fire that flame be to be suspect 
that hide itself when that a man of valour 
grace his country with a good attempt 
you give a sword a horse a manor nay 
sometime a whole province for reward we have 
a sense of virtue too as well as you 
and shall we be deny the liberty 
to show we have that sense a favour be 
the alm of love I do not pass away 
my heart in charity virtuous Cratander 
show forth so full a transcript of your life 
in all but his misfortune that methinks 
you may admire yourself in he as in 
your shade but yet let chaste Atossa rather 
not be at all than not be whole you 

thou be still virtuous my Atossa still 
transparent as thy crystal but more spotless 
fool that we be to think the eye of love 
must always look on we the vine that climb 
by conjugal embracement about the elm 
may with a ring or two perhaps encircle 
some neighbour bough and yet this twine prove 
not the offence but charity of love 

that we have natural a desire 
to preserve honour be a principle 
not questionable but by those that will 
corrupt and rob we of it that you prize 
your chastity more than wealth and think your cabinet 
cheap and unworthy if compare to your mind 
I be so assure that I need only tell you 
the danger not entreat you to avoid it 
the slave next night intend a rape upon 
your honour and your wealth to tell your husband 
be to procure a slaughter on both side 
if we avert the riot and become 
our own defence the honour as the action 
will be entire we which may be do 
only by fly to Arsamnes castle 
a thing so easy that it will only be 
to take the air for fame and when we do 
return our husband shall strew praise in 
our way which we will tread on and contemn 

let we fly let we fly let we fly 

how I do love 
these worthy noble thought the action 
will make our tomb not need a epitaph 
when we shall live still fresh in history 
the sacred god of marriage will present 
themselves unto you night by night for this 
and personal thank you in your dream 
for thus preserve their rite undefiled 
but time be short I must away to make 
provision for our flight if any do 
desire a further satisfaction 
in this our grand design we leave our lady 
Mandane here and Ariene who 
can give a full relation of our business 

away away to the castle to the castle 

urge i no more I be sure my country 
require not perjury 

ought any word 
be keep with enemy no path be foul 
that lead to liberty 

o Photion 
such man as you have make our grecian faith 
become a proverb to express treachery 
a oath be the same in Persia and in Greece 
and bind alike in either 

but consider 
we be thrall and yoke the hard gain of our sweat 
must be send in to serve their luxury 
tribute and tax and payment will still keep we 
as in a siege to take the air perhaps 
will be a charge unto we 

nor be it Ephesus 
that only dread this slavery Claros too 
and Colophon nay Magnesia and other 
that join in the war do fear a share in the tyranny 

your force be so weaken that you can 
regain a perfect liberty your friend 
begin to fall off too all that you can 
expect now be to settle these your evil 
and live protect as a weaken friend 
under the persian shelter still preserve 
your law and liberty inviolate 
a thing perhaps yet rather to be wish for 
then compass 

yet methinks you may procure it 
have such command 

what may be do in so 
short space shall all be to your good go then 
and deal discreet with the army tell they 
the tempest that be fall on their head 
unless the persian shield they when you have 
persuade they to this conduct your force 
towards Arsamnes castle where the queen 
and lady now expect i but be sure 
you come not within sight of Sardis 

why 
shall we not march beyond the frontier then 

by no mean for you will cut off all retreat 
now when you see the numerous persian come 
you may secure fly without the loss 
of any this will quell the future rise 
of those who frowardness be not content 
either with the calm or tempest of affair 
we must comply with fortune now we be conquer 
permit the rest unto the god and i 

success attend it 

so my next care now 
must be to avoid those slave who I overhear 
have a design upon my life but let 
even the plot destiny contrive 
and be themselves of council all their malice 
shall only show a idle fruitless hate 
while wisdom take the upper hand of fate 

holla 

holla 

Archippus 

Leocrates never be afraid man it be I the very same 

before Mercury I do not know thou thy come forth out of the wood with that raw arm and those totter clothes make thou show like Actaeon new revive after his worry 

where be Stratocles and Philotas 

they be look burrleaf perhaps for excoriation or else rob some gibbet to accommodate themselves with decent weed 

holla 

holla 

hark I hear they they be hard by let we answer they holla 

o be you there 

save thou brother Stratocles joy to thou valiant Philotas I commend you that you keep your word I be glad we be so punctual 

do you think we have no religion in we it be a most corrupt time when such as we can keep touch and be faithful one to another 

but be you sure Cratander will pass by this way 

my lord Praxaspes say he love this walk 

but we have do ill to leave our weapon yonder 

pish he will pass by this hour he be busy yet we will fetch they as soon as we can agree who shall do the deed 

who shall do the deed say thou why thou or he or he or I 

do thou then if thou have a mind to it 

no faith thou shall have the whole honour of it to thyself I will not rob thou of a inch of it I be not envious Leocrates not envious 

well the next passenger be to decide it then he that shall be judge the fit to make a persian priest must do the deed 

what else do thou think we will be so base as not to stand to covenant 

you have all make yourselves very unfit to be priest methinks 

why so Philotas do you not see wooden leg and crutch wry neck and lame arm maim limb and blind side 

good faith we may be all take for a hospital break loose 

and we have wood enough among we to 
as I hope for mercy Cratander by the ball of fortune here he come soul of my life what shall we do 

not a sword not a knife among we all leave behind we in the wood that we shall be all manacle now out of a most unlucky policy we shall never have he alone again make towards he and be hang that he may resolve the question however 

Bless thy sense and thy limb fair master do a courtesy to a company of poor distress Persian it be not money we ask nor clothes only thy judgement thy judgement man of understanding 

what be your request 

that out of thy great wisdom soul of learning thou will be please to tell we free which of we four be fit to make a persian priest 

I be not well skilled in your persian rite as Cra view they narrow they fall to their posture 
I know not what man or how qualify 
your temple may admit of but I have 
two or three servant within call here they 
shall umpire this your variance ho sisarme 
ho Artobazes draw nigh quick seize Ent servant 
these four pernicious rascal do you think 
you can lie hide it be not your leg good Stratocles 
nor your close arm Leocrates that can 
disguise you from my eye I can tell you 
who drink my death who be your grand abettor 
in this design you now will know who be fit 
to make a persian priest malicious fool 
be it not all one as to ask i who 
be fit to sacrifice i but you see 
I live and will do to your punishment 
go away with they take they as they be 
let they not alter either clothes or posture 
but lead they through the city thus to Molops 
and give he charge to keep they so until 
he hear our far pleasure 

come along gentleman we will try your stump 
how many mile a day you can halt 

sirrah be civil or else before jove I will pull off my wooden leg and break your pate with it though I die for it 

we be like to have a honest court of it short 

you speak my lord as if it be not so now 

it be honest now and short will not have 
the power to be otherwise 

why Hydarnes 

there be not a woman leave man all be vanish 
and flee upon the sudden 

what I hope 
they have not change their sex all in a minute 
they be not leap into rough chin and tulipant 

there be scarce a face without a beard appear 

a sign there be few eunuch in the palace 

my lord 
this be not to discover what be become of they 
they have take weapon with they too they say 

they have no sacrifice to perform that I 
can tell of neither if they have will they 
take arm that be to invade the deity 
the sword be no instrument of their devotion 

my lord you must make haste with all your force 
to the queen and lady in Arsamnes castle 
they now be likely all to be surprise 
by the remainder of the greek 

Cratander 
that damn villain have entice they thither 
mere to entrap they let we to the king 
we will on although against revolt slave 
we fight with man before but now with vice 
he call for death that must be conquer twice 

most virtuous queen you make i search myself 
to find the worth which you do so far prize 
as thus to hazard for one man who life 
be under value that which other will not 
for a whole kingdom reputation 

where goodness be to suffer I will willing 
become the sacrifice myself to free it 

have great Arsamnes be in danger have 
your whole line be in jeopardy of ruin 
you can have do no more your pity have 
thrust you into heroic action far 
beyond the eager valour of try captain 
which I can never worthy admire 
when I consider your reward will only 
be to be rank in story with a slave 

i do it not to the man but to the virtue 
the deed be reward enough unto itself 

it will be a piece of exemplary ingratitude 
to bring you into any danger hence 
you be safe as in your court your subject shall not 
run any doubtful hazard in the chance 
of a uncertain battle their first step 
shall be victorious and when your eloquence 
guard with beauty shall procure the freedom 
of our enthrall city the ephesian 
shall know a goddess great than their own 
and you depose our magnify Diana 
have shrine in every breast outshine she 
as for myself I shall live still in those 
good benefit my country shall receive 
this day instate i in immortality 
while raise thus our city by my fall 
I shall go down a welcome shade and dwell 
among the ancient father of my country 

leave the condition to i but peace 
expect i quiet a while they come 

can you contain sir look how proud he 
sit in the midst hem in on every side 
with beauty which his wheel eye run over 
all in a minute 

here be a delicacy 
that never be practise by a captive yet 
nor hear of since the custom first begin 
that conquer slave shall personate their king 

the luxury and riot of arm love 
o that my eye can dart forth pierce lightning 
that I can shoot some quick invisible plague 
into his boil marrow he be seat 
so that a dart or arrow can reach he 
without the danger of a persian breast 
worth all his nation but why name I worth 
where I see so much infamy o Atossa 
be this your amity to virtue this 
the pity that you lend afflict goodness 
there be work enough now for my sword although 
the enemy approach not credulous woman 
descend Arsamnes call thou if he be 
a name regard when cratander by 

most virtuous sir you may expect perhaps 
atossa breast grow strange and wrest from 
her wont faith but witness o thou sun 
who with a pious eye I now behold 
that I have neither try to unty or loosen 
that sacred knot but what I have condescend 
to aid thus far be only a fair likeness 
of something that I love in you 

if then 
your loyalty be still entire to i 
show it and yield Cratander up to we 

as his design be honourable so 
be our intent with which there needs must stand 
a resoluteness it can be virtue 
unless it be constant too the approach of the enemy 
forbid i to say more on to your victory 
your wont art to conquer they be the relic 
of a few scatter troop the fragment of 
the last meal that your sword make on and when 
you have subdue they whole we will plant 
fresh bay upon your brow and seal unto you 
a peace as everlasting as our love 

within arm arm arm arm 

Mithra and victory 

let we be resolute now my lady and 
at their return show they that they have something 
leave yet to conquer breast that be not shake 
with their loud noise of trumpet see they be come 
this be a race no battle let we prepare 

what fly upon the sight of we to appear 
be here to overcome a look have do 
the business of the sword your fear may sleep 
secure now open the castle gate 

but you must grant we some condition first 

must we be article with by our woman 
what be it an it please the god that you require 

cratander life 

it be not in your power 
to grant it great Arsamnes your queen speak 
out of a tender pity to no purpose 

hear i Arsamnes who the rage sword 
have spare why shall the peaceable destroy 
all hate be not end in the field I see 
there be something still more cruel after war 

Alas you know not what you ask the god 
permit not that he live he fall to they 

you must not hear she sir against the god 
who now expect their solemn feast and banquet 

if they be god pity be a banquet to they 
whenever the innocent and virtuous 
do escape death then be their festival 
nectar never flow more large then when blood be 
not spill that shall be save do you think the smoke 
of humane entrails be a steam that can 
delight the deity whoever do burn 
the building to the honour of the architect 
or break the tablet in the painter praise 
it be mercy be the sacrifice they like 

let not affection call a curse upon you 
while you permit it to take place of your 
religion 

see he will not live Atossa 
to do the unwilling man a courtesy 
be but a specious tyranny 

Alas 
he will be near the god he will leave we 
you must not shall not kill he my Arsamnes 
speak Ariene call to he Mandane 

you owe he sir the honour of your court 
slave have defile our husband bed and we 
bring forth a race of unlike child to 
blemish your realm and we when now by he 
we be all preserve immaculate and spotless 
as tender votary 

Consider next 
no heat rage have snatch a sacred goblet 
from any altar to profane it with 
the stream of bold intemperance no cry 
of virgin come unto your ear you have live 
this while as safe as if you have be guard 
by the revengeful thunder 

I may not 
afflict he with a curtsy it can it be 
a gift that he must be compel to take 

it be the best time to fall when there be most 
request make for our preservation 
though great Atossa I can wish that your 
bless prayer be spend in gain a good peace 
for hopeful Ephesus the god that do 
require my ruin will accept their safety 

he dare not be so bold unless he be innocent 

will you be so ungrateful then Cratander 
as after all to cast away yourself 
forbid he good Arsamnes by these tear 
I ask you but I be too womanish 

your majesty be not rock you have a nurse 
that be no tiger look but up upon she 

can you deny aught when the soul be pour 
out at the eye in a petition 

Cratander live we do command thou live 

bear witness o you god that I do suffer 
this as his servant too and you the soul 
of my decease countryman who fall 
in the last battle if there yet be sense 
in the forgetful urn know that it be 
no stratagem of i to be detain 
thus long from your society now to you 
Arsamnes good king equal those in law 
who they have overcome in war and to 
the valiant that chief part of good to which 
we all be bear sweet liberty be please 
even in the enemy your queen and other 
her lady here with the most beautiful 
part of your royal court be in my power 
but far be it from i to injure but the mean 
only one life I be so much master of 
since you have put it in my power that I 
must give it back again if it must be 
beyond the ephesian safety the altar come 
more welcome than the throne if this shall bring 
freedom to i and slavery to my city 

here I must dwell Arsamnes tie by great 
and solemn vow our god do now require it 
till you shall grant that the ephesian may 
still free use their ancient custom change 
neither their rite nor law yet still reserve 
this honest power unto your royal self 
to command only what the free be wont 
to undergo with gladness I presume 
you scorn to have they subject as your own 
and vile as stranger tyrant conquer thus 

it be a time of mercy you have only 
call forth those favour which be free come 
these generous thought have add to our conquest 
it be no victory that be get upon 
the sluggish and the abject descend then 
and when we have join our hand as pledge of 
our heart combine so let we return 
to the celebration of a equal triumph 
in a unite marriage of our joy 

there I confess a conquest where I find 
he that subdue my body gain my mind 

nay remember you kick i gentleman 

faith landlord Molops I will have swear thou have be of a better nature than to remember pot quarrel 
by my troth I shall have kick my father in that humour 

well you colloque now say I shall present you to Arsamnes and Cratander what will you do 

only welcome their return with a dance that so we may frisk into liberty 

yes and kick i again 

do thou think we be rogue and villain 

well with all my heart but upon this condition that you untie neither leg nor arm you know cratander charge 

do thou think we will bring thou into any danger we have study the figure and the measure already 

you must let the two old woman dance with you 

who the two whore that Cratander commit 

the very same they be wondrous suitable now for you must know that when such slippery eel do come under my finger the first thing that I do be to strip they and to put they into other case you will make a most perfect goblin masque among you 

why they will fall in piece if they stir but any thing violent 

no matter for fall in piece I will pawn my word to you they shall not sweat 

any thing good honest Molops we be content 

you within there polecat do you hear I have procure so much of the gentleman hold your breath be sure and remember you do not drown the music with your cough 

while thus we be join we be too hard for fortune scarce heaven itself can hurt we for it will not 
there be no care now remain but to invent 
new pleasure let the hour wheel swift away 
in sport and dance then we pay the god 
best thanks when we do show most sense of joy 

I have a humble suit to your majesty in the behalf of some distress people 

let we hear it what be it 

there be half a dozen of sinner at the door four of they be the captive which your majesty refuse two of they be of another sex but will willing join with they and present you with a dance in congratulation of your happiness 

go bring they in let prison this day know 
the joy of palace we will receive Ex Mol 
all the delight the world can yield we hark 

I hope your majesty will not deny 
to grace a company of young lady 
with the like favourable eye 

they do 
honour our joy in condescend to 
be actor in their celebration 

I see that Sardis have it be Amazon 
a army of these will subdue the world 

the fire be full kindle and the people 
all in their festival attire there want 
only the sacrifice and yourself to kill it 

the voice of raven in the dead of night 
convey not harsh note into my ear 
I have pardon he 

you can unless you 
will be more impious in preserve he 
than you be valorous in conquer 

will not the god receive a hecatomb 
of ox in exchange may we not find 
the destiny be in beast entrails we will choke 
the fire with weighty lump of rich gum 
and send perfume cloud up into their seat 
in one continue thankfulness if that 
they will spare this humane sacrifice 

to promise 
the fair captive and redeem he with 
a beast or tear of some relent tree 
be not to worship but delude 

Cratander 
the god recall my courtesy I stand 
double engage to heaven and to thou 
but thou can easy pardon for I know 
thy virtue be such that thou have rather suffer 
thyself than heaven shall be violate 
be then this sword must cut thy precious thread 
if statue may preserve thou and thou think it 
a life to flourish in fair memory 
I will people all my kingdom with thy image 
to which they shall pay vow as to those god 
who now require thy company 

you power 
why be you grow thus cruel unto virtue 
it will be a wish hereafter to be foul 
I can see he die and live myself 
pray you defer his death a while do post he 
away perhaps the god may spare he yet 

I know that diverse mind be here contain 
under one silence all expect how 
I will bear this sudden accident to accuse 
or god or man be the part of he that will 
live long if I look on the desire 
of some here whensoever I shall fall 
I shall be think to have live too little if 
on the action I have do I have live enough 
if on the injury of fortune too much 
if on my honour and my fame I shall 
live still he gain by death that do die praise 
other have long keep a empire but 
none better leave it to speak more be but 
a sluggard policy to defer his suffering 
on to the altar 

be thou willing too 
curse be my victory and thou my sword 
be never henceforth happy if there be 
another sacrifice to fall like this 
witness you god how I unwilling pay 
my vow in kind most virtuous Cratander 
worthy of heaven but yet to tarry long 
and make earth happy by thy presence look 
these tear I pay thou as a sad farewell 
I feel the blow myself that I must give thou 

these tear do neither befit you to pay 
nor i to take be then Arsamnes on 

I feel a numbness seize i I be stone 
I shall not lift my arm against thou sure 
the god desire it not 

thou o bright sun who see all 
look down upon our captive fall 
never be pure sacrifice 
it be not a man but virtue die 

while thus we pay our thanks propitious be 
and grant we either peace or victory 

but thou o sun may set and then 
in brightness rise next morn again 
he when he shall once leave this light 
will make and have eternal night 

good deed may pass for sacrifice o then 
accept the virtue and give back the man 

hold hold Arsamnes 
heaven be not please with your sacrifice 
the glorious sun have veil his face in cloud 
not willing to behold it and the sky 
have shed such numerous tear as have put out 
the fire though full kindle 

thou have now 
the voice and visage of the god good priest 
the heavens be never more serene the god 
have justify my care Cratander 

happy news 
death send thou back unto we this come not 
from any humane power it be not my hand 
that spare thou bless Cratander it be some God 
some God reserve thou unto great work 
for we and for thy country 

be then 
you so interpret it I will thus divide 
that life they lend i one half shall be you 
the other ephesus that my action 
wear both gratitude and piety 
like to some well wrought picture may at once 
behold both you and that I shall never be say 
the god reserve Cratander to a crime 
to make he fall more foul 

thy faith have be 
so firm and try thy moderation 
so stay that in a just reward I must 
myself conduct thou into Greece and there 
continue thou a king that what be mean 
for sport and mirth may prove a serious honour 
and thy three day pass over into a long 
and happy government to be rule by thou 
will be as freedom to they it will not be 
account slavery to admit a prince 
choose from out themselves thy virtue there 
may shine as in their proper sphere let other 
when they make war have this ignoble end 
to gain they slave Arsamnes gain a friend
