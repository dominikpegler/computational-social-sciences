and none but you can do it

in my right eye this corner here do you see 
to do some work and worthy of a chronicle 

how now gossip how do the play please you 

very scurvy methinks and sufficient nought 

as a body will wish here be nothing but a young prodigal come of age who make much of the barber buy he a place in a new office in the air I know not where and his man of law to follow he with the beggar to boot and they two help he to a wife 

ay she be a proper piece that such creature can break for 

I can abide that nasty fellow the beggar if he have be a courtbeggar in good clothes a beggar in velvet as they say I can have endure he 

or a beg scholar in black or one of these beggarly poet gossip that will hang upon a young heir like a horseleech 

or a threadbare doctor of physic a poor quacksalver 

or a seacaptain half starve 

ay these be tolerable beggar beggar of fashion you shall see some such anon 

I will fain see the fool gossip the fool be the fine man to the company they say and have all the wit he be the very justice of peace of the play and can commit who he will and what he will error absurdity as the toy take he and no man say black be his eye but laugh at he 

but they have no fool in this play I be afraid gossip 

it be a wise play then 

they be all fool the rather in that 

like enough 

my husband Timothy Tatle God rest his poor soul be wont to say there be no play without a fool and a devil in it he be for the devil still God bless he the devil for his money will he say I will fain see the devil and why will you so fain see the devil will I say because he have horn wife and may be a cuckold as well as a devil he will answer you be even such another husband quoth I be the devil ever marry where do you read the devil be ever so honourable to commit matrimony the play will tell we that say he we will go see it tomorrow the devil be a ass he be a errant learned man that make it and can write they say and I be foul deceive but he can read too 

I remember it gossip I go with you by the same token mrs trouble truth dissuade we and tell we he be a profane poet and all his play have devil in they that he keep school upon the stage can conjure there above the school of Westminster and doctor lamb too not a play he make but have a devil in it and that he will learn we all to make our husband cuckold at play by another token that a young marry wife in the company say she can find in her heart to steal thither and see a little of the vanity through her mask and come practice at home 

o it be mistress 

nay gossip I name nobody it may be it be myself 

but be the devil a proper man gossip 

as fine a gentleman of his inch as ever I see trust to the stage or anywhere else and love the common wealth as well as ere a patriot of they all he will carry away the vice on his back quick to hell in every play where he come and reform abuse 

there be the devil of Edmonton no such man I warrant you 

the conjurer cozen he with a candle end he be a ass 

but there be one Smug a smith will have make a horse laugh and break his halter as they say 

o but the poor man have get a shrewd mischance one day 

how gossip 

he have dress a rogue jade in the morning that have the stagger and have get such a spice of they himself by noon as they will not away all the play time do what he can for his heart 

it be his part gossip he be to be drink by his part 

say you so I understand not so much 

will we have such another part and such a man in this play I fear it will be a excellent dull thing 

expect intend it 

your grace be sad methinks and melancholy 
you do not look upon i with that face 
as you be wont my goddess bright Pecunia 
although your grace be fall of two in the hundred 
in vulgar estimation yet be I 
you grace servant still and teach this body 
to bend and these my age knee to buckle 
in adoration and just worship of you 
Indeed I do confess I have no shape

ay my gossip Tatle know what fine slip grow in Gardinerslane who kiss the butcher wife with the cowsbreath what match be make in the bowlingalley and what bet win and lose how much grist go to the mill and what beside who conjure in Tutlefield and how many when they never come there and which boy ride upon doctor lamb in the likeness of a roar lion that run away with he in his tooth and have not devour he yet 

why I have it from my maid Joan hearsay and she have it from a limb of the school she say a little limb of nine year old who tell she the master leave out his conjure book one day and he find it and so the fable come about but whether it be true or no we gossip be bind to believe it an it be once out and afoot how shall we entertain the time else or find ourselves in fashionable discourse for all company if we do not credit all and make more of it in the report 

for my part I believe it and there be no wise than I I will have never a cunning schoolmaster in England I mean a cunningman a schoolmaster that be a conjurer or a poet or that have any acquaintance with a poet they make all their scholar playboy be it not a fine sight to see all our child make interluder do we pay our money for this we send they to learn their grammar and their Terence and they learn their playbook well they talk we shall have no more parliament God bless we but an we have I hope Zealoftheland busy and my gossip rabbi Troubletruth will start up and see we shall have painful good minister to keep school and catechise our youth and not teach they to speak play and act fable of false news in this manner to the supervexation of town and country with a wanion

thou do not know the man nor can thou know he 
till thou have serve some year in that deep school 
that be both the nurse and mother of the art 
and hear he read interpret and demonstrate 
a mastercook why he be the man of man 
for a professor he design he draw 
he paint he carve he build he fortify 
make citadel of curious fowl and fish 
some he drydish some mote round with broth 
mount marrowbone cut fifty angle custard 
rear bulwark pie and for his outerwork 
he raise rampart of immortal crust 
and teach all the tactic at one dinner 
what rank what file to put his dish in 
the whole art military then he know 
the influence of the star upon his meat 
and all their season temper quality 
and so to fit his relish and sauce 
he have nature in a pot above all the chemist 
or airy brethren of the Rosiecrosse

a soldier a physician a philosopher 
a general mathematician

who be the scum and excrement of man 
if thou have seek out good and virtuous person 
of these profession I have love thou and they 
for these shall never have that plea against i 
or colour of advantage that I hate 
their calling but their manner and their vice 
a worthy courtier be the ornament 
of a king palace his great master honour 
this be a moth a rascal a courtrat 
that gnaw the commonwealth with broke suit 
and eat grievance So a true soldier 
he be his country strength his sovereign safety 
and to secure his peace he make himself 
the heir of danger nay the subject of it 
and run those virtuous hazard that this scarecrow 
can endure to hear of 

you be pleasant sir 

with you I dare be here be Piedmantle 
because he be a ass do not I love a herald 
who be the pure preserver of descent 
the keeper fair of all nobility 
without which all will run into confusion 
be he a learned herald I will tell he 
he can give arm and mark he can honour 
no more than money can make noble it may 
give place and rank but it can give no virtue 
and he will thank i for this truth this dogleech 
you style he doctor because he can compile 
a almanac perhaps erect a scheme 
for my great madam monkey when it have take 
a glister and bewray the Ephemerides 
do I despise a learned physician 
in call he a quacksalver or blast 
the everliving garland always green 
of a good poet when I say his wreath 
be piece and patch of dirty wither flower 
away I be impatient of these ulcer 
that I not call you worse there be no sore 
or plague but you to infect the time I abhor 
your very scent Come lady since my prodigal 
know not to entertain you to your worth 
I will see if I have learn how to receive you 
he point he to his patch cloak throw off with more respect to you and your fair train here 
farewell my beggar in velvet for today 
tomorrow you may put on that grave robe 
and enter your great work of canter college 
your work and worthy of a chronicle 

why this be the worst of all the catastrophe 

the matter begin to be good but now and he have spoil it all with his beggar there 

a beggarly Jack it be I warrant he and a kin to the poet 

like enough for he have the chief part in his play if you mark it 

absurdity on he for a huge overgrow playmaker why shall he make he live again when they and we all think he dead if he have leave he to his rag there have be a end of he 

ay but set a beggar on horseback he will never lin till he be a gallop 

the young heir grow a fine gentleman in this last act 

so he do gossip and keep the best company 

And feast they and his mistress 

And show she to they all be not jealous 

but very communicative and liberal and begin to be magnificent if the churl his father will have let he alone 

it be spiteful do of the poet to make the chuff take he off in his height when he be go to do all his brave deed 

to find a academy 

erect a college 

Plant his professor and water his lecture 

with wine gossip as he mean to do and then to defraud his purpose 

Kill the hope of so many towardly young spirit 

as the doctor 

and the courtier I protest I be in love with master Fitton he do wear all he have from the hatband to the shoetie so political and will stoop and leer 

and lie so in wait for a piece of wit like a mousetrap 

Indeed gossip so will the little doctor all his behaviour be mere glister on my conscience he will make any party physic in the world work with his discourse 

I wonder they will suffer it a foolish old fornicate father to ravish away his son mistress 

and all her woman at once as he do 

I will have fly in his gypsy face i'faith 

it be a plain piece of political incest and worthy to be bring afore the high commission of wit suppose we be to censure he you be the young voice gossip Tatle begin 

marry I will have the old coneycatcher cozen of all he have in the young heir defence by his learned counsel mr picklock 

I will rather the courtier have find out some trick to beg he from his estate 

or the captain have courage enough to beat he 

or the fine madrigalman in rhyme to have run he out of the country like a irish rat
