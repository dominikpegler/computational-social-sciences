a thousand sigh keep daily centinel 
that beat like whirlwind all my comfort back 
as many sob guard my distress heart 
that no relief come near to aid my soul 
million of woe like band of arm man 
stop up the passage of my sweet relief 
and be thou then persuade that thy word 
can any comfort to my soul afford 
no no good Frank dear brother then forbear 
unless with grief in i you will take a share 

grief i no grief but tell i what it be 
make my sweet Ferdinand thus passionate 
I will conjure grief if grief be such a evil 
in spite of fortune fate or any devil 

will thou not leave i to myself alone 

brother you know my mind 
if you will leave your dumpish melancholy 
and like myself banish that pule humour 
or satisfy my expectation 
by tell whence your sorrow do proceed 
I will not only cease to trouble you 
but like a true skilful physician 
seek all good mean for your recovery 

well brother you have much importune i 
and for the confidence I have in you 
that you will prove secret I will now unfold 
the load of care that press down my soul 
know then good Frank love be the cause hereof 

how love why what be that love 

a child a little little boy that be blind 

and be overcome by he plague by he 
drive into dump by he put down by a boy 
master by love o I be mad for anger 
by a boy be there no rosemary and bay in England 
to whip the ape by a boy 

ay such a boy as thou can never see 
and yet ere long may feel he tyranny 
he be not visible yet aim at the heart 
woe be to those that feel his wound dart 
and one of they I be wound so deep 
that in my passion I no mean can keep 
unhappy time woe to that dismal hour 
when love do wound i with fair Phillis flower 
oh Phillis Phillis of flower sweet flower 
that ever garnish any princely bower 
farewell farewell my woe will never remove 
till I enjoy fair Phillis for my love Exit 

what be here Phillis and love and love and Phillis 
I have see Phillis and have hear of love 
I will see Phillis and will hear of love 
but neither Phillis nor the power of love 
shall make i bondslave to a woman beck 
who be here my second brother malcontent 
I will stand aside and note his passion 

o love that I have never know thy power 

more lover yet what the devil be this love 

that these my wander eye have keep their stay 
that I myself have still be like myself 
that my poor heart have never feel the wound 
who anguish keep i in a deadly sound 
o how delude dream this night overpass 
drench my sad soul in pleasure float sea 
methinks I clasp my love within my arm 
and circle she save she from threaten harm 
methinks there come a hundred in a hour 
that seek to rob i of my sweet flower 
but like a champion I do keep she still 
within this circle free from every ill 
but when I wake and miss my Phillis there 
all my sweet joy convert into fear 

what brother Anthony at prayer so hard 
tell i what saint it be thou invocate 
be it a male or female howsoever 
God bless thou brother thou be in a good mind 
but now I remember i thy saint be blind 

how blind 

I brother blind I hear thou talk of love 
and love be blind they say 

I will it be as blind as ebon night 
that love have never hit my heart so right 
but what be love in your opinion 

a voluntary motion of delight 
touch the superficies of the soul 
a substance less divine then be the soul 
yet more than any other power in man 
be that which love yet neither be enforce 
nor do enforce the heart of man to love 
which motion as it unbeseem a man 
so by the soul and reason which adorn 
the life of man it be extinguish 
even at his pleasure that it do possess 

thus may the freeman jest at manacle 
the furclad citizen laugh at a storm 
the swarthy moor dive to gather pearl 
challenge the scald ardour of the sun 
and age Nestor sit in his tent 
may term wound sport and war but merriment 

it be true fore God it be and now methinks 
my heart begin to pity heart in love 
say once more Anthony tell i thy grief 
let i have feeling of my passion 
possess i deep of thy melt state 
and thou shall see 

that thou will pity i 

no by my troth if every tale of love 
or love itself or foolbewitching beauty 
make i crossarm myself study ayme 
defy my hatband tread beneath my foot 
shoestring and garter practise in my glass 
distress look and dry my liver up 
with sigh enough to win a argosy 
if ever I turn thus fantastical 
love plague i never pity i at all 

yonder she come that hold i prisoner 

what Phillis the fair maid of the exchange 
be she god Cupid judge over man heart 
brother I will have one veny with her tongue 
to breathe my wit and jest at passion 
by your leave mistress flower 

your rude behaviour scarce offer you welcome 

I prithee tell i Phillis I hear say 
thou keep love captive in thy maiden thought 

that be a thought beyond your reach to know 

but shall I know it 

on what acquaintance then may you deem i fond 
if as you say love be at my command 

may not your friend command as great a matter 

I will know he well first for that friend may flatter 

why I hope you know i

the same and I be chicken of one brood 
and if you know he as I be sure you do 
be his brother you needs must know i too 

I partly have a guess of yonder gentleman 
his name be master Golding as I take it 

Golding I be and thy sweet fair I be 
and yet not thou but a most wretched man 
thou know my cause of grief my wound of woe 
and know it why will thou see it so 
put salve of comfort to my grief unrest 
so may thou heal my sore of heaviness 

hark you fair maid be you a surgeon 
I prithee give my brother Anthony 
somewhat to heal the love sore of his mind 
and yet it be pity that he shall have help 
a man as free as air or the sun ray 
as boundless in his function as the heaven 
the male and better part of flesh and blood 
in who be pour the quintessence of reason 
to wrong the adoration of his maker 
by worship a wanton female skirt 
and make love his idol fie dotard fie 
I be ashamed of this apostasy 
I will talk with she to hinder his complaint 
Phillis a word in private ere you go 
I love you sweet 

sour it may be so 

sour and sweet faith that do scarce agree 

two contrary and so be we

sir a gentleman of good learning and my friend 
to say the truth it be write for myself 
be somewhat overtake with fond love 
as many man be sir 

why be thou persuade or haste thou any hope 
so beautiful a virgin as she be 
of such fair parentage so virtuous 
so gentle kind and wise as Phillis be 
that she will take remorse of such base stuff 
I think not so but let i see what be thy name 

trusty john man call i sir 

how come it then your blind secretary 
have write another name unto the letter 
you devote Anthony Golding 
but sure this letter be no right of thou 
either thou find the same by happy chance 
or be employ as a messenger 
play leger dumaine with he that send the same 
wherefore the maid well know unto myself 
I will reserve the letter to her use 
that she if by the name herein set down 
she know the gentleman that do wish she well 
she may be grateful for his courtesy 

nay then I see I must disclose myself 
sir may I build upon your secrecy 
I will disclose a secret of import 

assure thyself I will not injure thou 

then cripple know I be not what I seem 
but take this habit to deceive my friend 
my friend indeed but yet my cruel foe 
foe to my good my friend in outward show 
I be no porter as I seem to be 
but young brother to that Anthony 
and to be brief I be in love with Phillis 
which my two elder brother do affect 
the one of they seek to defeat the other 
now if that I be their young brother 
can gull they both by get of the wench 
I will requite it with love recompense 
cripple thou once do promise i thy love 
when I do rescue thou on Mileend green 
now be the time now let i have thy aid 
to gull my brother of that beauteous maid 

sir what I promise I will now perform 
my love be you my life to do you good 
which to approve follow i but in all 
we will gull your brother in the wench and all 

say thou i so friend for that very word 
my life be thou command my hand and sword 

then let i see this letter it shall see i 
you undertake to carry from your brother 
to the maid 

I do and from my brother Ferdinand 
this other letter to the same effect 

well list to i and follow my advice 
you shall deliver neither of they both 
but frame two letter of your own invention 
letter of flat denial to their suit 
give they to both your brother as from Phillis 
and let each line in either letter tend 
to the dispraise of both their feature 
and the conclusion I will have set down 
a flat resolve bind with some zealous oath 
never to yield to either of their suit 
and if this sort not well to your content 
condemn the cripple 

but this will ask much time 
and they by this time look for my return 

why then myself will fit you present 
I have the copy in my custody 
of sundry letter to the same effect 

of thy own write 

my own I assure you sir 

faith thou have rob some sonnet book or other 
and now will make i think they be thy own 

why think thou that I can write a letter 
ditty or sonnet with judicial phrase 
as pretty please and pathetical 
as the best ovidimitating dance 
in all the town 

I think thou can not 

yea I will swear I can 
yet sirrah I can coneycatch the world 
make myself famous for a sudden wit 
and be admire for my dexterity 
be I dispose 

I pray thou how 

why thus there live a poet in this town 
if we may term our modern writer poet 
sharpwitted bittertongued his pen of steel 
his ink be temper with the bite juice 
and extract of the bitter weed that grow 
he never write but when the element 
of fire and water tilt in his brain 
this fellow ready to give up his ghost 
to Lucia bosom do bequeath to i 
his library which be just nothing 
but roll and scroll and bundle of cast wit 
such as dare never visit Paul churchyard 
among they all I happen on a choir 
or two of paper fill with song and ditty 
and here and there a hungry epigram 
these I reserve to my own proper use 
and paternosterlike have con they all 
I can now when I be in company 
at ale house tavern or a ordinary 
upon a theme make a extemporal ditty 
or one at least shall seem extemporal 
out of the abundance of this legacy 
that all will judge it and report it too 
to be the infant of a sudden wit 
and then be I a admirable fellow 

this be a piece of cunning 

I can do more for I can make enquiry 
where the best witted gallant use to dine 
follow they to the tavern and there sit 
in the next room with a calf head and brimstone 
and over hear their talk observe their humour 
collect their jest put they into a play 
and tire they too with payment to behold 
what I have filch from they this I can do 
but oh for shame that man shall so arraign 
their own fee simple wit for verbal theft 
yet man there be that have do this and that 
and more by much more than the most of they 

but to our purpose cripple to these letter 

I have they ready for you here they be 
give these to your two brother say that Phillis 
deliver they with frown and though her name 
be not subscribe which may not well be do 
it may perhaps give they occasion 
to think she scorn they so much grace and favour 
this do return to i and let i know 
the occurrant of this practice as they grow 
and so farewell I can no long stand 
to talk with you I have some work in hand Exit 

farewell mad cripple now Frank Golding sly 
to put in practise this new policy 
but soft here come the maid I will assay 
to plead my own love by a strange way 
by your leave sir 

porter I be not for you you see I be perambulate before a female 

I will crave but a word with you
