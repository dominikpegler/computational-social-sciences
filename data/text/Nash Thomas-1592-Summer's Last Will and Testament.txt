look each hour to yield my life and throne 
and die I have in deed unto the earth 
but that Eliza England beauteous queen 
on who all season prosperous attend

and wish long to live to her content 
but wish be not have when they wish well

Come near my friend for I be near my end 
in presence of this honourable train

a small matter I know one spend in less than a year eight and fifty pound in mustard and another that run in debt in the space of four or five year above fourteen thousand pound in lute string and grey paper 

o monstrous unthrift whoever hear the like 
the sea vast throat in so short tract of time 
devour nor consume half so much 
how well may thou have live within thy bound 

what talk you to i of live within my bound I tell you none but ass live within their bound the silly beast if they be put in a pasture that be eat bare to the very earth and where there be nothing to be have but thistle will rather fall sober to those thistle and be hungerstarve than they will offer to break their bound whereas the lusty courser if he be in a barren plot and spy better grass in some pasture near adjoin break over hedge and ditch and to go ere he will be pen in and not have his belly full peradventure the horse late swear to be steal carry that youthful mind who if they have be ass will have be yet extant 

thus we may see the long we live the more we shall learn I never think honesty a ass till this day 

this world be transitory it be make of nothing and it must to nothing wherefore if we will do the will of our high creator who will it be that it pass to nothing we must help to consume it to nothing gold be more vile than man man die in thousand and ten thousand yea many time in hundred thousand in one battle if then the best husband be so liberal of his best handiwork to what end shall we make much of a glitter excrement or doubt to spend at a banquet as many pound as he spend man at a battle methinks I honour Geta the roman emperor for a brave mind fellow for he command a banquet to be make he of all meat under the sun which be serve in after the order of the alphabet and the clerk of the kitchen follow the last dish which be two mile off from the foremost bring he a index of their several name neither do he pingle when it be set on the board but for the space of three day and three night never rise from the table 

o intolerable lie villain that be never beget without the consent of a whetstone 

ungracious man how fond he argue 

tell i I pray wherefore be gold lay under our foot in the vein of the earth but that we shall contemn it and tread upon it and so consequent tread thrift under our foot it be not know till the iron age donec facinus inuasit mortales as the poet say and the scythian always detest it I will prove it that a unthrift of any come near a happy man in so much as he come near to beggary Cicero say summum bonum consist in omnium rerum vacation that it be the chief felicity that may be to rest from all labour now who do so much vacare à rebus who rest so much who have so little to do as the beggar who can sing so merry a note as he that can change a groat cui nil est nil deest he that have nothing want nothing on the other side it be say of the carl omnia habeo nec quicquam habeo I have all thing yet want every thing multi mihi vitio vertunt quia egeo say Marcus Cato in Aulus Gellius at ego illis quia nequeunt egere many upbraid i say he because I be poor but I upbray they because they can live if they be poor it be a common proverb dinesque miserque a rich man and a miserable nam natura paucis contenta none so content as the poor man admit that the chief happiness be not rest or ease but knowledge as Herillus Alcidamas and many of Socrates follower affirm why paupertas omnes perdocot art poverty instruct a man in all art it make a man hardy and venturous and therefore it be call of the poet paupertas audax valiant poverty it be not so much subject to inordinate desire as wealth or prosperity Non habet unde suum paupertas pascat amorem poverty have not wherewithal to feed lust all the poet be beggar all alchemist and all philosopher be beggar omnia mea mecum porto quoth bias when he have nothing but bread and cheese in a leathern bag and two or three book in his bosom saint Francis a holy saint and never have any money it be madness to dote upon muck that young man of Athens Aelianus make mention of may be a example to we who dote so extreme on the image of fortune that when he may not enjoy it he die for sorrow the earth yield all her fruit together and why shall not we spend they together I thank heaven on my knee that have make i a unthrift 

o vanity itself oh wit ill spend 
so study thousand not to mend their life 
but to maintain the sin they most affect 
to be hell advocate against their own soul 
Ver since thou give such praise to beggary 
and have defend it so valiant 
this be thy penance thou shall never appear 
or come abroad but Lent shall wait on thou 
his scarcity may countervail thy waste 
riot may flourish but find want at last 
take he away that know no good way 
and lead he the next way to woe and want 
thus in the path of knowledge many stray 
and from the mean of life fetch their decay 

Heigh ho here be a coil in deed to bring beggar to stock I promise you true I be almost asleep I think I have be at a sermon well for this one night exhortation I vow by God grace never to be good husband while I live but what be this to the purpose hur come to powl as the Welshman say and her pay a halfpenny for burr seat and her hear the preacher talk and a talk very well by gis but yet a can make her laugh go a theater and hear a queen fice and he make her laugh and laugh her bellyful so we come hither to laugh and be merry and we hear a filthy beggarly oration in the praise of beggary it be a beggarly poet that write it and that make he so much commend it because he know not how to mend himself well rather than he shall have no employment but lick dish I will set he a work myself to write in praise of the art of stoop and how there be never any famous thresher porter brewer pioneer or carpenter that have straight back repair to my chamber poor fellow when the play be do and thou shall see what I will say to thou 

Vertumnus call solstitium 

solstitium come into the court without peace there below make room for master solstitium

what have thou gain we what have thou bring in 

Alas my lord what give you i to keep 
but a few day eye in my prime of youth 
and those I have convert to white hair 
I never love ambitious to climb 
or thrust my hand too far into the fire 
to be in heaven sure be a bless thing 
but atlaslike to prop heaven on one back 
can but be more labour than delight 
such be the state of man in honour place 
they be gold vessel make for servile use 
high tree that keep the weather from low house 
but can shield the tempest from themselves 
I love to dwell betwixt the hill and dale 
neither to be so great to be envy 
nor yet so poor the world shall pity i 
inter utrumque tene medio tutissimus ibis 

what do thou with those balance thou bear 

in they I weigh the day and night alike 
this white glass be the hourglass of the day 
this black one the just measure of the night 
one more than other hold not a grain 
both serve time just proportion to maintain 

I like thy moderation wondrous well 
and this thy balance weigh the white glass 
and black with equal poise and steadfast hand 
a pattern be to prince and great man 
how to weigh all estate indifferent 
the spiritualty and temporalty alike 
neither to be too prodigal of smile 
nor too severe in frown without cause 
if you be wise you monarch of the earth 
have two such glass still before your eye 
think as you have a white glass run on 
good day friend favour and all thing at beck 
so this white glass run out as out it will 
the black come next your downfall be at hand 
take this of i for somewhat I have try 
a mighty ebb follow a mighty tide 
but say solstitium have thou nought beside 
nought but day eye and fair look give I thou 

nothing my lord nor aught more do I ask 

but have thou always keep thou in my sight 
thy good desert though silent will have ask 

desert my lord of ancient servitor 
be like old sore which may not be rip up 
such use these time have get that none must beg 
but those that have young limb to lavish fast 

I grieve no more regard be have of thou 
a little soon have thou speak to i 
thou have be hear but now the time be past 
death wait at the door for thou and i 
let we go measure out our bed in clay 
nought but good deed hence shall we bear away 
be as thou be best steward of my hour 
and so return unto thy country bower 

fie fie of honesty fie solstitium be a ass perdie this play be a gallimaufry fetch i some drink somebody what cheer what cheer my heart be not you thirsty with listen to this dry sport what have we to do with scale and hourglass except we be baker or clockkeeper I can tell how other man be addict but it be against my profession to use any scale but such as we play at with a bowl or keep any hour but dinner or supper it be a pedantical thing to respect time and season if a man be drink with good fellow late he must come home for fear the gate be shut when I be in my warm bed I must rise to prayer because the bell ring I like no such foolish custom actor bring now a black jack and a roundlet of of rhenish wine dispute of the antiquity of red nose let the prodigal child come out in his doublet and hose all greasy his shirt hang forth and never a penny in his purse and talk what a fine thing it be to walk summerly or sit whistle under a hedge and keep hog go forward in grace and virtue to proceed but let we have no more of these grave matter

Vertumnus call Orion 

Orion Urion Arion my lord thou must look upon Orion gentleman dogkeeper huntsman come into the court look you bring all bound and no bandog peace there that we may hear their horn blow 

sirrah be thou that call we from our game 
How dare thou be but a petty God 
disturb i in the entrance of my sport 

it be I Orion cause thou to be call 

it be I dread lord that humble will obey 

how hap thou leave the heaven to hunt below 
as I remember thou be Hireus son 
who of a huntsman jove choose for a star 
and thou be call the dogstar be thou not 

please your honour heaven circumference 
be not enough for he to hunt and range 
but with those venombreathed cur he lead 
he come to chase health from our earthly bound 
each one of those foulmouthed mangy dog 
govern a day no dog but have his day 
and all the day by they so govern 
the dogday height infectious fosterer 
of meteor from carrion that arise 
and putrify body of dead man 
be they engender to that ugly shape 
be nought else but preserve corruption 
it be these that in the entrance of their reign 
the plague and dangerous ague have bring in 
they be and bark at night against the moon 
for fetch in fresh tide to cleanse the street 
they vomit flame and blast the ripen fruit 
they be death messenger unto all those 
that sicken while their malice bear sway 

a tedious discourse build on no ground 
a silly fancy autumn have thou tell 
which no philosophy do warrantise 
no old receive poetry confirm 
I will not grace thou by confute thou 
yet in a jest since thou rail so against dog 
I will speak a word or two in their defence 
that creature be best that come most near to man 
that dog of all come near thus I prove 
first they excel we in all outward sense 
which no one of experience will deny 
they hear they smell they see better than we 
to come to speech they have it questionless 
although we understand they not so well 
they bark as good old saxon as may be 
and that in more variety than we 
for they have one voice when they be in chase 
another when they wrangle for their meat 
another when we beat they out of door 
that they have reason this I will allege 
they choose those thing that be most fit for they 
and shun the contrary all that they may 
they know what be for their own diet best 
and seek about for it very careful 
at sight of any whip they run away 
as run a thief from noise of hue and cry 
nor live they on the sweat of other brow 
but have their trade to get their live with 
hunt and coneycatch two fine art 
yea there be of they as there be of man 
of every occupation more or less 
some carrier and they fetch some waterman 
and they will dive and swim when you bid they 
some butcher and they worry sheep by night 
some cook and they do nothing but turn spit 
Chrysippus hold dog be logician 
in that by study and by canvas 
they can distinguish betwixt three several thing 
as when he come where three broad way meet 
and of those three have stay at two of they 
by which he guess that the game go not 
without more pause he run on the three 
which as Chrysippus say insinuate 
as if he reason thus within himself 
either he go this that or yonder way 
but neither that nor yonder therefore this 
but whether they logician be or no 
cynic they be for they will snarl and bite 
right courtier to flatter and to fawn 
valiant to set upon the enemy 
most faithful and most constant to their friend 
nay they be wise as Homer witness 
who talk of Ulysses come home 
say all his household but Argus his dog 
have quite forget he ay and his deep insight 
nor Pallas art in alter of his shape 
nor his base weed nor absence twenty year 
can go beyond or any way delude 
that dog physician be thus I infer 
they be never sick but they know their disease 
and find out mean to ease they of their grief 
special good surgeon to cure dangerous wound 
for strike with a stake into the flesh 
this policy they use to get it out 
they trail one of their foot upon the ground 
and gnaw the flesh about where the wound be 
till it be clean draw out and then because 
ulcer and sore keep foul be hardly cure 
they lick and purify it with their tongue 
and well observe Hipocrates old rule 
the only medicine for the foot be rest 
for if they have the least hurt in their foot 
they bear they up and look they be not stir 
when humour rise they eat a sovereign herb 
whereby what cloy their stomach they cast up 
and as some writer of experience tell 
they be the first invent vomit 
shame thou not autumn unadvised 
to slander such rare creature as they be 

we call thou not Orion to this end 
to tell a story of dog quality 
with all thy hunt how be we enrich 
what tribute pay thou we for thy high place 

what tribute shall I pay you out of nought 
hunter do hunt for pleasure not for gain 
while dogday last the harvest safe thrive 
the sun burn hot to finish up fruit growth 
there be no bloodletting to make man weak 
physician with their cataposia 
r tittle Elinctoria 
masticatorum and cataplasmata 
their gargarism clyster and pitch clothes 
their perfume syrup and their treacle 
refrain to poison the sick patient 
and dare not minister till I be out 
then none will bathe and so be few drown 
all lust be perilsome therefore less use 
in brief the year without i can stand 
summer I be thy staff and thy right hand 

a break staff a lame right hand I have 
if thou be all the stay that hold i up 
nihil violentum perpetuum 
no violence that live to old age 
illgoverned star that never boad good luck 
I banish thou a twelvemonth and a day 
forth of my presence come not in my sight 
nor show thy head so much as in the night 

I be content though hunt be not out 
we will go hunt in hell for better hap 
one part blow my heart unto our friend 
to bid the field and huntsman all farewell 
toss up your bugle horn unto the star 
toil find ease peace follow after war 

faith this scene of Orion be right prandium caninum a dog dinner which as it be without wine so here be a coil about dog without wit if I have think the ship of fool will have stay to take in fresh water at the I will of dog I will have furnish it with a whole kennel of collection to the purpose I have have a dog myself that will dream and talk in his sleep turn round like Ned fool and sleep all night in a porridge pot mark but the skirmish between sixpence and the fox and it be miraculous how they overcome one another in honourable courtesy the fox though he wear a chain run as though he be free mock we as it be a crafty beast because we have a lord and master to attend on run about at our pleasure like masterless man young sixpence the best page his master have play a little and retire I warrant he will not be far out of the way when his master go to dinner learn of he you diminutive urchin how to behave yourselves in your vocation take not up your stand in a nuttree when you shall be wait on my lord trencher shoot but a bit at buttes play but a span at point whatever you do memento mori remember to rise betimes in the morning

turn moon and star to freeze meteor 
and make the ocean a dry land of ice 
with tempest of my breath turn up high tree 
on mountain heap up second mount of snow 
which melt into water may fall down 
as fall the deluge on the former world 
I hate the air the fire the spring the year 
and what so ever bring mankind any good 
o that my look be lightning to blast fruit 
will I with thunder present may die

winter be mild his son be rough and stern 
Ovid can well write of my tyranny 
when he be banish to the freeze zone 

And banish be thou from my fertile bound 
winter imprison he in thy dark cell 
or with the wind in bellow cave of brass 
let stern Hipporlatos lock he up safe 
never to peep forth but when thou faint and weak 
want he to aid thou in thy regiment 

I will peep forth thy kingdom to supplant 
my father I will quick freeze to death 
and then sole monarch will I sit and think 
how I may banish thou as thou do i 

I see my downfall write in his brow 
convey he hence to his assign hell 
father be give to love their son too well 

no by my troth nor mother neither I be sure I can never find it this backwinter play a rail part to no purpose my small learning find no reason for it except as a backwinter or a after winter be more rage tempestuous and violent than the begin of winter so he bring he in stamp and rage as if he be mad when his father be a jolly mild quiet old man and stand still and do nothing the court accept of your meaning you may have write in the margin of your playbook let there be a few rush lay in the place where backwinter shall tumble for fear of raying his clothes or set down enter backwinter with his boy bring a brush after he to take off the dust if need require but you will never have any wardrobe wit while you live I pray you hold the book well we be not nonplus in the latter end of the play 

this be the last stroke my tongue clock must strike 
my last will which I will that you perform 
my crown I have dispose already of 
item I give my wither flower and herb 
unto dead corpse for to deck they with 
my shady walk to great man servitor 
who in their master shadow walk secure 
my pleasant open air and fragrant smell 
to Croyden and the ground abut round 
my heat and warmth to toil labourer 
my long day to bondman and prisoner 
my short night to young marry soul 
my drought and thirst to drunkard quenchless throat 
my fruit to autumn my adopt heir 
my murmur spring musician of sweet sleep 
to murmur malcontent with their well tune care 
channel in a sweet fall quatorzain 
do lull their ear asleep listen themselves 
and final oh word now cleanse your course 
unto Eliza that most sacred dame 
who none but saint and angel ought to name 
all my fair day remain I bequeath 
to wait upon she till she be return 
autumn I charge thou when that I be dead 
be press and serviceable at her beck 
present she with thy goodly ripen fruit 
unclothe no arbour where she ever sit 
touch not a tree thou think she may pass by 
and winter with thy writhe frosty face 
smooth up thy visage when thou look on she 
thou never look on such bright majesty 
a charm circle draw about her court 
wherein warm day may dance and no cold come 
on sea let wind make war not vex her rest 
quiet enclose her bed think fly her breast 
ah gracious queen though summer pine away 
yet let thy flourish stand at a stay 
first droop this universals age frame 
ere any malady thy strength shall tame 
heaven raise up pillar to uphold thy hand 
peace may have still his temple in thy land 
Loe I have say this be the total sum 
autumn and winter on your faithfulness 
for the performance I do firm build 
farewell my friend summer bid you farewell 
archer and bowler all my follower 
a dieu and dwell with desolation 
silence must be your master mansion 
slow march thus descend I to the fiend 
weep heaven mourn earth here summer end 
autumn have all the summer fruitful treasure 
go be our sport flee be poor Croyden pleasure 
short day sharp day long night come on apace 
ah who shall hide we from the winter face 
cold do increase the sickness will not cease 
and here we lie God know with little ease 
from winter plague and pestilence good lord deliver we 
London do mourn Lambeth be quite forlorn 
trade cry woe worth that ever they be bear 
the want of term be town and city harm 
close chamber we do want to keep we warm 
long banish must we live from our friend 
this low build house will bring we to our end 
from winter plague and pestilence good lord deliver we
