when first you come from Florence will the world 
have with a universal dire eclipse 
be over whelm no more to gaze on day 
that you to Spain have never find the way 
here to be lose for ever 

we from one climate 
draw inspiration as thou then have eye 
to read my wrong so be thy head a engine 
to raise up ponderous mischief to the height 
and then thy hand the executioner 
a true italian spirit be a ball 
of wildfire hurt most when it seem spend 
great ship on small rock beat oft be rend 
and so let Spain by we but Malateste 
why from the presence do you single i 
into this gallery 

to show you madam 
the picture of yourself but so deface 
and mangle by proud Spaniard it woo whet 
a sword to arm the poor florentine 
in your just wrong 

as how let we see that picture 

here it be then time be not scarce four day old 
since I and certain don sharpwitted fellow 
and of good rank here with two jesuit 
grave profound scholar in deep argument 
of various proposition at the last 
question be move touch your marriage 
and the king precontract 

so and what follow 

whether it be a question move by chance 
or spiteful of purpose I be there 
and your own countryman I can tell 
but when much toss 
have bandy both the king and you as please 
those that take up the racket in conclusion 
the father jesuit to who subtle music 
every care there be tie stand with their life 
in stiff defence of this opinion 
o pardon i if I must speak their language 

say on 

that the most catholic king in marry you 
keep you but as his whore 

be we their theme 

and that Medina niece Onaelia 
be his true wife her bastard son they say 
the king be dead shall claim and wear the crown 
and whatsoever child you shall bear 
to be but bastard in the high degree 
as be beget in adultery 

we will not grieve at this but with hot vengeance 
beat down this arm mischief Malateste 
what whirlwind can we raise to blow this storm 
back in their face who thus shoot at i 

if I be fit to be your counsellor 
thus will I speak feign that you be with child 
the mother of the maid and some wear lady 
who oft have guilty be to court great be 
may though it be not so get you with child 
with swear that it be true 

say it be believe 
or that it so do prove 

the joy thereof 
together with these earthquake which will shake 
all Spain if they their prince do disinherit 
so bear of such a queen be only daughter 
to such a brave spirit as the duke of Florence 
all this buzz into the king he can choose 
but charge that all the bell in Spain echo up 
this joy to heaven that bonfire change the night 
to a high noon with beam of sparkle flame 
and that in church organ charm with prayer 
speak loud for your most safe delivery 

what fruit grow out of these 

these you must stick 
as here and there spring weed in bank of flower 
spy among the people who shall lay their ear 
to every mouth and steal to you their whisper 

So 

it be a plummet to sound spanish heart 
how deep they be you beside a guess 
be hereby make of any faction 
that shall combine against you which the king see 
if then he will not rouse he like a dragon 
to guard his golden fleece and ride his harlot 
and her base bastard hence either by death 
or in some trap of state ensnare they both 
let his own ruin crush he 

This go to trial 
be thou my magic book which read over 
their counterspell we will break or if the king 
will not by strong hand fix i in his throne 
but that I must be hold Spain blaze star 
be it a ominous charm to call up war 

here be a parcel of man flesh have be hang up and down all this morning to speak with you 

be it not some executioner
