how now what rare discourse be you fall upon ha have you find any familiar here that you be so free what be the business 

Nothing but the understanding gentleman on the ground here ask my judgement 

your judgement rascal for what sweep the stage or gather up the break apple for the bear within away rogue it be come to a fine degree in these spectacle when such a youth as you pretend to a judgement and yet he may in the most of this matter i'faith for the author have write it just to his meridian and the scale of the ground judgement here his playfellow in wit gentleman not for want of a prologue but by way of a new one I be send out to you here with a scrivener and certain article draw out in haste between our author and you which if you please to hear and as they appear reasonable to approve of the play will follow present Read scribe give i the counterpane 

article of agreement indent between the spectator or hearer at the hope on the Bankside in the county of Surrey on the one party and the author of Bartholomew fair in the say place and county on the other party the one and thirty day of Octob 1614 and in the twelve year of the reign of our sovereign lord James by the grace of God king of England France and Ireland defender of the faith and of Scotland the seven and forty 
inprimis it be covenant and agree by and between the party abovesaid and the say spectator and hearer aswell the curious and envious as the favour and judicious as also the ground judgement and understanding do for themselves several covenant and agree to remain in the place their money or friend have put they in with patience for the space of two hour and a half and somewhat more in which time the author promise to present they by we with a new sufficient play call Bartholomew fair merry and as full of noise as sport make to delight all and to offend none provide they have either the wit or the honesty to think well of themselves 
it be further agree that every person here have he or their freewill of censure to like or dislike at their own charge the author have now depart with his right it shall be lawful for any man to judge his six pennyworth his twelve pennyworth so to his eighteen penny 2 shilling half a crown to the value of his place provide always his place get not above his wit and if he pay for half a dozen he may censure for all they too so that he will undertake that they shall be silent he shall put in for censure here as they do for lot at the lottery marry if he drop but six penny at the door and will censure a crown worth it be think there be no conscience or justice in that 
it be also agree that every man here exercise his own judgement and not censure by contagion or upon trust from another voice or face that sit by he be he never so first in the commission of wit as also that he be fix and settle in his censure that what he approve or not approve today he will do the same tomorrow and if tomorrow the next day and so the next week if need be and not to be bring about by any that sit on the bench with he though they indite and arraign play daily he that will swear jeronimo or Andronicus be the best play yet shall pass unexcepted at here as a man who judgement show it be constant and have stand still these five and twenty or thirty year though it be a ignorance it be a virtuous and stay ignorance and next to truth a confirm error do well such a one the author know where to find he 
it be further covenant conclude and agree that how great soever the expectation be no person here be to expect more than he know or better ware than a fair will afford neither to look back to the sword and bucklerage of Smithfield but content himself with the present in stead of a little Davy to take toll of the bawd the author do promise a strut horsecourser with a leerdrunkard two or three to attend he in as good equipage as you will wish and then for kindheart the toothdrawer a fine oily pigwoman with her tapster to bid you welcome and a consort of roarer for music a wise justice of peace meditant in stead of a juggler with a ape a civil cutpurse searchant a sweet singer of new ballad allurant and as fresh a hypocrite as ever be broach rampant if there be never a servantmonster in the fair who can help it he say nor a nest of antic he be loath to make nature afraid in his play like those that beget tale tempest and such like drollery to mix his head with other man heel let the concupiscence of jig and dance reign as strong as it will among you yet if the puppet will please anybody they shall be entreat to come in 
in consideration of which it be final agree by the foresay hearer and spectator that they neither in themselves conceal nor suffer by they to be conceal any statedecipherer or politic picklock of the scene so solemn ridiculous as to search out who be mean by the gingerbreadwoman who by the Hobbyhorseman who by the Costardmonger nay who by their ware or that will pretend to affirm on his own inspire ignorance what mirror of magistrate be mean by the justice what great lady by the pigwoman what conceal statesman by the seller of mousetrap and so of the rest but that such person or person so find be leave discover to the mercy of the author as a forfeiture to the stage and your laughter aforesaid as also such as shall so desperate or ambitious play the fool by his place aforesaid to challenge the author of scurrility because the language somewhere savour of Smithfield the booth and the pigbroth or of profaneness because a madman cry God quit you or bless you in witness whereof as you have preposterous put to your seal already which be your money you will now add the other part of suffrage your hand the play shall present begin and though the fair be not keep in the same region that some here perhaps will have it yet think that therein the author have observe a special decorum the place be as dirty as Smithfield and as stink every whit 
howsoever he pray you to believe his ware be still the same else you will make he just suspect that he that be so loath to look on a baby or a hobbyhorse here will be glad to take up a commodity of they at any laughter or loss in another place
