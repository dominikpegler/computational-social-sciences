and a back not like a thresher but a bend 
and courtlike back and so forth for your body

since your outside promise little I will enlarge it 
though never so narrow as your art to thrive 
your composition with the cook and butler 
fory coneyskin and chip and half a share 
with all the underofficer of the house

I care you nothing 
then sing her asleep with curious catch 
of your own make for as I have hear 
you be poetical 

Something give that way 
yet my work seldom thrive and the main reason 
the poet urge for it be because I be not 
as poor as they be 

very likely fetch she 
while I be in the vain 

it be a apt time my lady be at her prayer 

let she pray on 
nay go and if upon my intercession 
she do you not some favour I will disclaim she 
I will ruminate on it the while 

a hundred crown be your reward 

without they nay no trifle Ex Malf

how to get money yet want eye to see

a future favour that we may preserve he

my conference with a kinsman can call 
your anger on i 

kinsman let i have 
no more of this as you desire you may continue i 

why madam under pardon 
suppose he otherwise yet come in 
a lawful way it be excusable 

how be this 

I grant you be make of pureness 
and that your tenderness of honour hold 
the sovereignty over your passion yet you have 
a noble husband with allow embrace 
to quench lascivious fire shall such flame in you 
as I must never believe be I the wife 
of one that can but zany brave Cleander 
even in his least perfection excuse 
my overbold inference I shall desire 
to meet no other object 

you grow saucy do I look further 

no dear madam and 
it be my wonder or astonishment rather 
you can deny the service of Lisander 
a man without a rival one the king 
and kingdom gaze on with admiration 
for all the excellency a mother can 
wish in her only son 

do not my honour 
and obligation to Cleander force i 
to be deaf to his complaint 

it be true but yet 
your rigor to command he from your presence 
argue but small compassion the grove 
witness his grievous suffering your fair name 
upon the rind of every gentle poplar 
and amorous myrtle tree to Venus sacred 
with adoration carve and kneel unto 
this you unseen of he both see and hear 
without compassion and what receive he 
for his true sorrow but the heavy knowledge 
that it be your peremptory will and pleasure 
however my lord live in he he shall quit 
your sight and house for ever 

I confess I give he a strong potion to work 
upon his hot blood and I hope it will cure he 
yet I can wish the cause have concern other 
I may have meet his sorrow with more pity 
at least have lend some counsel to his misery 
though now for honour sake I must forget he 
and never know the name more of Lisander 
yet in my justice I be bind to grant he 
lay his love aside most true noble 
but mention he no more this instant hour 
my brother lydian new return from travail 
and his brave friend clarange long since rival 
for fair and rich Olinda be to hear 
her absolute determination who 
she please to elect see all thing ready 
to entertain they and on my displeasure 
no more word of Lisander 

she endure to hear he name by no tongue but her own 
however she carry it I know she love he Exit 

hard nature hard condition of poor woman 
that where we be most sue too we must fly most 
the tree grow up and mix together free 
the oak not envious of the sail Cedart 
the lusty vine not jealous of the ivy 
because she clip the elm the flower shoot up 
and wanton kiss one another hourly 
this blossom glory in the other beauty 
and yet they smell as sweet and look as lovely 
but we be tie to grow alone o honour 
thou hard law to our life chain to our freedom 
he that invent thou have many curse 
how be my soul divide o Cleander 
my best deserve husband o Lisander 
the true lover that ever sacrifice 
to Cupid against Hymen oh my honour 
a tyrant yet to be obey and it be 
but justice we shall thy strict law endure 
since our obedience to thou keep we pure Exit 

how insupportable the difference 
of dear friend be the sorrow that I feel 
for my lisander absence one that stamp 
a reverend print on friendship do assure i 
you be rival for a lady a fair lady 
and in the acquisition of her favour 
hazard the cut of that gordian knot 
from your first childhood to this present hour 
by all the tie of love and amity fasten 
I be bless in a wife heaven make i thankful 
inferior to none sans pride I speak it 
yet if I be a freeman and can purchase 
at any rate the certainty to enjoy 
lisander conversation while I live 
forgive i my Caliste and the sex 
I never will seek change 

my lord and brother 
I dare not blame your choice lisander worth 
be a mistress to be ever court 
nor shall our equal suit to fair Olinda 
weaken but add strength to our true affection 
with zeal so long continue 

when we know 
who she prefer as she can choose but one 
by our so long try friendship we have vow 
the other shall desist 

it be yet your purpose 
but how this resolution will hold 
in he that be refuse be not alone 
doubtful but dangerous

when I have make he i all pleasure that 
the sweetness of his manner youth and virtue 
can give assurance of but turn this way 
to brave clarange in his face appear 
a kind of majesty which shall command 
not sue for favour if the fair lady 
of France set forth with nature best endowment 
nay shall I add a princess of the blood 
do now lay claim to either for a husband 
so vehement my affection be to both 
my envy at her happiness will kill i 

the strange love I ever hear

so full of gravity and with such sweetness 
deliver that it draw the admiration

to give he hear

for I be full of melancholy thought 
against which I have hear with reason music 
to be the speedy cure pray you apply it 

adieu fond love farewell you wanton power 
I be free again 
thou dull disease of blood and idle hour 
bewitch pain 
fly to the fool that sigh away their time

here lie Cleander dead and here the sword 
of false Lisander too long cover with

in Cloridon and chrysanthes she have lose 
two hopeful son that may have do their part 
to guard she from invasion for what cause then 
to keep the opinion of my valour upright 
in the popular breath a sandy ground to build on 
buy with the king displeasure as the breach 
of heaven decree the loss of my true comfort 
in parent kinsman friend as the fruition 
of all that I be bear to and that sit 
like to a hill of lead here in my exile

we must look on 
the cause and not the person yet behold 
with a impartial eye the excel beauty 
of this fair lady which we do believe 
upon report but till now never see they 
it move a strange kind of compassion in i 
let we survey you near she be a book 
to be with care peruse and it be my wonder 
if such misshape guest as lust and murder 
at any price shall ever find a lodging 
in such a beauteous inn mistake we not 
though we admire the outward structure if 
the room be foul within expect no favour 
I be no man if I can look on beauty 
distress without some pity but no king 
if any superficial gloss of feature 
can work i to decline the course of justice 
but to the cause cleander death what proof 
can you produce against she 

royal sir touch that point my brother death 
we build on supposition 

supposition how be such a lady sir to be condemn 
on supposition 

they be well ground sir 
and if we make it evident she be guilty 
of the first crime we charge she with adultery 
that be the parent it may find belief 
that murder be the issue 

we allow 
it may be so but that it may be must not 
infer a necessary consequence 
to cast away a lady life what witness 
to make this good 

the principal this woman 
for many year her servant she have take

affect one another so much for they sir 
that I a simple waitingwoman have take 
my bodily oath the first night of admittance 
into her ladyship service on her slipper 
that be the book to serve her will in all thing 
and to know no religion but her pleasure 
it be not yet out of fashion with some lady 
that I as the premise show be command 
to do my function in conveyance of

in that she urge and I will confess 
a guilty cause the people voice which be 
the voice of truth my husband tenderness 
in his affection to i that no dotage 
but a reward of humbleness the friendship 
echo through France between he and Lisander 
all make against she for he in his absence 
whatever imputation it draw on i 
I must take leave to speak it be true he love i 
but not in such a wanton way his reason 
master his passion I grant I have 
at midnight conference with he but if he

of his life for appear on my soul 
he will maintain enter Lisander and Alcidon 

and will thou clear example of woman pureness
