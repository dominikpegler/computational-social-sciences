may tolerate unlikely argument 
but heaven admit no jest wit that presume 
on wit too much by strive how to prove 
there be no god with foolish ground of art 
discover first the near way to hell 
and fill the world with devilish atheism 
such question youth be fond for better it be 
to bless the sun than reason why it shine

o Giovanni have thou leave the school 
of knowledge to converse with lust and death 
for death wait on thy lust look through the world 
and thou shall see a thousand face shine 
more glorious than this idol thou adore 
leave she and take thy choice it be much less sin 
though in such game as those they lose that win 

it be more ease to stop the ocean 
from float and ebb than to dissuade my vow 

then I have do and in thy wilful flame 
already see thy ruin heaven be just 
yet hear my counsel 

as a voice of life 

hie to thy father house there lock thou fast 
alone within thy chamber then fall down 
on both thy knee and grovel on the ground

ah sirrah here be work for the nonce I have a suspicion of a bad matter in my head a pretty while ago but after my madam scurvy look here at home her waspish perverseness and loud faultfinding then I remember the proverb that where hen crow and cock hold their peace there be sorry house 'sfoot if the low part of a shetailor cunning can cover such a swell in the stomach I will never blame a false stitch in a shoe while I live again up and up so quick and so quick too it be a fine policy to learn by who this must be know and I have think on it here be the way or none what cry old mistress alas alas I can blame thou we have a lord heaven help we be so mad as the devil himself the more shame for he 

o Vasques that ever I be bear to see this day 
do he use thou so too sometime Vasques

alas good heart it be against her will full sore 

I dare be swear all his madness be for that she will not confess who it be which he will know and when he do know it I be so well acquaint with his humour that he will forget all straight well I can wish she will in plain term tell all for that be the way indeed 

do you think so 

foe I know it provide that he do not win she to it by force he be once in a mind that you can tell and mean to have wring it out of you but I somewhat pacify he for that yet sure you know a great deal
