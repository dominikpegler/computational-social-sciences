you be welcome to your country dear Antonio 
you have be long in France and you return 
a very formal Frenchman in your habit 
how do you like the french court 

I admire it 
in seek to reduce both state and people 
to a fix order there judicious king 
begin at home quit first his royal palace 
of flatter sycophant of dissolute 
and infamous person which he sweet term 
his master masterpiece the work of heaven 
consider due that a prince court 
be like a common fountain whence shall flow 
pure silverdrop in general but if it chance 
some curse example poison it near the head 
death and disease through the whole land spread 
and what be it make this bless government 
but a most provident council who dare free 
inform he the corruption of the time 
though some of the court hold it presumption 
to instruct prince what they ought to do 
it be a noble duty to inform they 
what they ought to foresee here come Bosola 
the only courtgall yet I observe his rail 
be not for simple love of piety 
indeed he rail at those thing which he want 
will be as lecherous covetous or proud 
bloody or envious as any man 
if he have mean to be so here be the cardinal 

I do haunt you still 

So 

I have do you 
better service than to be slight thus 
miserable age where only the reward 
of do well be the do of it 

you enforce your merit toomuch 

I fall into the galley in your service 
where for two year together I wear two towel in stead of 
a shirt with a knot on the shoulder after the fashion of a 
roman mantle slight thus I will thrive some way 
blackbird fatten best in hard weather why not I 
in these dog day 

will you can become honest 

with all your divinity do but direct i the way to it I 
have know many travel far for it and yet return as 
arrant knave as they go forth because they carry 
themselves always along with they be you go 
some fellow they say be possess with the devil 
but this great fellow be able to possess the great 
devil and make he worse 

he have deny thou some suit 

he and his brother be like plumtree that grow crooked 
over standingpool they be rich and overload with 
fruit but none but crow pie and caterpillar feed 
on they can I be one of their flatter pander I 
will hang on their ear like a horseleech till I be full and 
then drop off I pray leave i 
who will rely upon these miserable dependence in expectation to 
be advance tomorrow what creature ever feed worse then hope 
Tantalus nor ever do any man more fearful than he that hope 
for a pleadon there be reward for hawk and dog and 
when they have do we service but for a soldier that hazard his 
limb in a battle nothing but a kind of geometry be his last supportation 

geometry 

ay to hang in a fair pair of sling take his latterswing in the 
world upon a honourable pair of crutch from hospital 
to hospital fare you well sir and yet do not you scorn we for 
place in the court be but like bed in the hospital where this 
man head lie at that man foot and so low and low 

I know this fellow seven year in the galley

by the french general Gaston de Foux

will poison all his goodness for I will tell you

like moth in cloth do hurt for want of wear

that we may imitate the love palm 
best emblem of a peaceful marriage 
that never bear fruit divide

a fearful madness I owe she much of pity exeunt 

you say you will fain be take for a eminent courtier 

it be the very main of my ambition 

let i see you have a reasonable good face for it already 
and your nightcap express your ear sufficient large 
I will have you learn to twirl the string of your band with a 
good grace and in a set speech at the end of every sentence 
to hum three or four time or blow your nose till it smart again 
to recover your memory when you come to be a precedent in 
criminal cause if you smile upon a prisoner hang he but if 
you frown upon he and threaten he let he be sure to escape 
the gallow 

I will be a very merry precedent 

do not sup anights it will beget you a admirable wit 

rather it will make i have a good stomach to quarrel 
for they say you roaringboy eat meat seldom 
and that make they so valiant 
but how shall I know whether the people take i 
for a eminent fellow 

I will teach a trick to know it 
give out you lie a die and if you 
hear the common people curse you 
be sure you be take for one of the prime nightcap

a miracle these in thy face here be deep rut 
and foul slough the last progress

flay the skin off her face to make it more level 
and whereas before she look like a nutmeggrater

morphewed lady to make she disembogue again

to find in it the fat of serpent spawn of snake jew spittle 
and their young child ordure and all these for the face 
I will soon eat a dead pigeon take from the sole of the foot 
of one sick of the plague then kiss one of you fast 
here be two of you who sin of your youth be the very 
patrimony of the physician make he renew his 
footcloth with the spring and change his 
highprized courtesan with the fall of the leaf 
I do wonder you do not loathe yourselves 
observe my meditation now 
what thing be in this outward form of man 
to be belove we account it ominous 
if nature do produce a colt or lamb 
a fawn or goat in any limb resemble 
a man and fly from it as a prodigy 
man stand amaze to see his deformity 
in any other creature but himself 
but in our own flesh though we bear disease 
which have their true name only take from beast 
as the most ulcerous wolf and swinish measel 
though we be eat up of louse and worm 
and though continual we bear about we 
a rot and dead body we delight 
to hide it in rich tissue all our fear 
nay all our terror be lest our physician 
shall put we in the ground to be make sweet 
your wife be go to Rome you two couple and get you 
to the well at Leuca to recover your ache 
I have other work on foot I observe our duchess

compliment whatsoever shall I confess myself to you

a lawyer mule of a slow pace will both surt 
my disposition and business for mark i

a vicar go to law for a tithepig 
and undo his neighbour make they spoil 
a whole province and batter down goodly 
city with the cannon

this reverend garment join you in commission 
with the right fortunate soldier the marquis of Pescara 
and the famous Lanoy

at Naples 

this great count Malastete I perceive 
have get employment

a marginal note in the musterbook that he be 
a voluntary lord 

he be no soldier 

he have wear gunpowder in his hollow tooth for the toothache 

he come to the leaguer with a full intent 
to eat fresh beef and garlic mean to stay 
till the scent begone and straight return to court 

he have read all the late service 
as the city chronicle relate it 
and keep two pewterer go only to express 
battle in model 

then he will fight by the book 

by the almanac I think 
to choose good day and shun the critical 
that be his mistress scarf 

yes he protest 
he will do much for that taffeta 

I think he will run away from a battle 
to save it from take prisoner 

he be horrible afraid 
gunpowder will spoil the perfume on it 

I see a Dutchman break his pate once 
for call he potgun he make his head 
have a boar in it like a musket

about they go to wrack for it 

what be that Bosola 

I know he in Padua a fantastical scholar 
like such who study to know how many knot be in 
Hercules club of what colour Achilles beard be 
or whether Hector be not trouble with the toothache 
he have study himself half bleareyed to know the 
true symmetry of Caesar nose by a shooinghorn and this 
he do to gain the name of a speculative man 

mark prince Ferdinand 
a very salamander live in his eye 
to mock the eager violence of fire 

that cardinal have make more bad face with his oppression 
then ever Michael Angelo make good one 
he lift up his nose like a foul porpoise before a storm 

the lord Ferdinand laugh 

like a deadly cannon 
that lighten ere it smoke 

these be your true pang of death 
the pang of life that struggle with great statesman

of Ancona to determine of a free prince

how that the pope forehear of her looseness

she will muse four hour together and her silence 
methinks express more than if she speak

yond be the cardinal window this fortification 
grow from the ruin of a ancient abbey 
and to yond side of the river lie a wall 
piece of a cloister which in my opinion 
give the best echo that you ever hear 
so hollow and so dismal and withal 
so plain in the distinction of our word 
that many have suppose it be a spirit 
that answer 

I do love these ancient ruin 
we never tread upon they but we set 
our foot upon some reverend history 
and questionless here in this open court 
which now lie naked to the injury 
of stormy weather some man lie inter 
love the church so well and give so large to it 
they think it shall have canopy their bone 
till doomsday but all thing have their end 
church and city which have disease like to man 
must have like death that we have 

like death that we have

a very deadly accent 

deadly accent
