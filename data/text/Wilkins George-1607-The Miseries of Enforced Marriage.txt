then greedy viper that devour their mother 
they eat on she but to preserve themselves 
and he consume himself and beggar we 
a tavern be his inn where among slave 
he kill his substance make pot the grave 
to bury that which our forefather give 
I ask he for our portion tell he that you

how now butler what be the meaning of this 

your brother mean to lame as many as he can that be a beggar himself many live with he in the hospital his wife send i out of Yorkshire to tell he that God have bless he with two son he bid a plague of they a vengeance of she cross i over the pate and send i to the surgeon to seek salve I look at least he shall have give i a brace of angel for my pain 

thou have not lose all thy longing I be sure he have give thou a crack crown 

a plague on his finger I can tell he be your brother and my master I will be loath to prophesy of he but whosoever do curse his child be infant ban his wife lie in childbed and beat his man bring he news of it they may be bear rich but they shall live slave be knave and die beggar

during the time that they be useless 
but none with infant bless can nourish hate 
but love the mother for the child sake 

but he that be give over unto sin 
leprose therewith without and so within

heaven be and have his gracious eye 
to give man life not like entrap spy 

your hand you you to you my soul to you a kiss 
introth I be sorry I have stray amiss 
to who shall I be thankful all silent 
none speak whist why then to God 
that give man comfort as he give his rod 
your portion I will see pay and I will love you 
you three I will live withal my soul shall love you 
you be a honest servant sooth you be 
to who I these and all must pay amends 
but you I will admonish in cool term 
let not promotion hope be as a string 
to tie your tongue or let lose it to sting 

from hence it shall not sir 

then husband thus shall nourish with their wife 

as thou and I will wench 
brother in brotherly love thus link together 

child and servant pay their duty thus 
and all be please 

we be 

then if all these be so 
I be new wed so end old marriage woe 
and in your eye so love be wed 
we hope your hand will bring we to our bed
