triumph woman to our state to brandish forth such 
fruitless menace to prison with she we will think of 
further torment I will prostitute thy body to some slave

so passionate to weep at the queen distress 

Alas sir who can choose passion methinks

hale to prison some will have pity she though 
but a mean woman much more at such a sovereign fall 

I brother and suppose her son though royal 
have see our mother as we see she in princely compassion 
perhaps they will have do the like 

no doubt nay master without offence it be your fault too 
for in your eye I spy a pearl of pity 

good faith thou say true I can do no less neither 
do I discommend you for it it be a good bosom where mercy dwell

our privacy which we desire more than throng visitant 
what be it you will have of i I will give my state to any of you all 
take it away and give i here only myself to govern 
more be too much to impose on my poor weakness 

that be too much sweet lady do not task your happy virtue 
to so hard a proof there be no strict injunction seal 
to bar the passage to a nuptial bed that be a statute by 
self will decree to make Hymen a bond slave 

o good sir Hugh how long have you lay a fruitless siege 
unto a port that be impregnable I thank you and must needs 
acknowledge my love if I have such a lunacy to be a debt 
to you you have deserve it be it worth receipt 

then give desert his due leave of these nice point of cold 
virginity and warm affection in the sweet embrace 
of a noble husband fit for your state than this cloister habit 

so shall you win a second power to you this noble prince 
will with a husband be a strong defence 
against your enemy 

add to necessity a prove loyalty a love that will not 
claim equality but bind unto 

no more no more I pray while sure my foe will not 
this cruel be to encounter i at such unequal odds 
so many soldier against a silly woman you can call 
this conquest if you win I claim the law of arm 
a friendly parley ere the battle join the time 
let it be now I crave the friendly respite of a month 
mean time let i hear no more love alarm then will 
I either yield you up the fort or stand in the defiance 

so so sir Hugh there be now some hope 

a promise fair hope more than my three year service 
have before a month sweet beauty oh let it be more to show 
my love wear humble constancy let it be two or three 

I take you at your word it shall be three sir Hugh in which time 
I lock by virtue of this hand and tongue your hand from any 
suit that sound but love you shall not name the word 
within my presence it be breach of peace if you do 

you have lock the closet and keep the key of it 

Come then sir Hugh since you have trust with love 
let we deal with arm another while that when our foe 
come they may perceive that we expect they 

my life be my country and I will offer for they 
three month I go a banish man from hence 
yet this I will borrow from beauteous excellence 
when my white plume shall in the field be spread 
my word of courage shall be Winifred exeunt Hugh and lord 

alas good prince I can but pity thou 
and grieve because my pity be pitiless 
like a miser alm God help without charity 
for I shall never quite thy labour love 
no prince Amphiabell you have wed i to a celestial 
bridegroom you have teach my ignorance a know intellect 
it be well begin and who will not persevere 
to love that love that live and last for ever 

I come to strengthen you fair Winifred so to continue 
I hope I need not yet not so strict to virginity 
as to the christian faith for wedlock be a ordinance from heaven 
though junior to the single purity 
in this chaste wedlock do the conquest win 
she know the tree forbid it will not sin 

but I have make a vow think then what danger a relapse 
will be and you will grant my best virginity 
and I will further show what heaven have do 
to aid my female resolution you then will bid 
i cross the book of love and read of nothing 
but that text above 

you promise i no less 

I will make it good 
see you this spring here a pretty stream begin his head 
so late it be a parch drought have cease our verdant grass 
here do I sit in contemplation lift to heaven my orison 
for present succour but swift than my thought 
all potent heaven a miracle have wrought 
that barren seem ground bring forth a spring 
of such sweet water as it have not be curse in the old world 
deluge I cause it then thus to be dig and frame 
by hand of man and come still to see it as before 
a heavenly shape appear and bless it more 
give it that power as heaven have so assign 
to cure disease help the lame and blind 
for which poor people their poor thank to tell music 
calls as I will not Winifred well 

it be wonderful 

hark these sound do I hear when that celestial 
body do appear let we with reverence attend aloof 
your eye or ear shall have a further proof 

with this the sign that holy Christian wear 
when in the field their standard they up rear 
against the foe of heaven with this type 
that when they receive the seal regenerate 
give they their christian name with this I bless again 
this hallow spring who seek redress with a believe heart 
here he shall find ease take power to cure the 
leprous disease give leg unto the cripple blind their sight 
so that their blessing be receive aright 
to misbeliever turn into a curse 
who seek a cure in scorn disease he worse 
this heaven have do for truth it be but young 
and needs a miracle to make her strong 
the time will come when man shall here not see 
then let the world express fidelity 
good prayer have power to fetch a angel down 
and give a mortal a immortal crown 

I need no more confirm you beauteous maid 
myself I will task unto some dangerous end 
I will take disguise and straight to Verolam 
and to the face of persecute Albon 
our friend and fellow knight I will tell his curse 
if he persist in barbarous cruelty 
I will throw my life in hazard if I fall 
tell Christian keep my true memorial 

which first leave here with i you shall do well 
here will I keep my court here will I dwell 
here let the roman tyrant shed my blood 
here they shall find i do all the good 
a poor wretch can what heaven have bless before 
I as a second mean will help the poor 

to that I leave thou most virtuous maid 
o may it of Amphiabell be say 
his good intendment have so happy end 
to make a christian of a bloody fiend 
I come to try thou Albon

now to screw and wrest a text from his native sense will 
help i well in this what be I a woman what be he a man 
where be the inequality my blood royal his perhaps ignoble 
whence spring that fount that run all royalty it be the sea
