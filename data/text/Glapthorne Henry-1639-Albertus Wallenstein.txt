like subtle lightning purge the German air 
from all the hot infection foreign war

with which the valiant palatine and his aid 
infest have the province give to death 
that thunderbolt of war who very name

the Swedish king and must he now his age 
be candid over with victory be enforce 
to a base resignation death he be damn 
that dare but mutter it

who first occasion it it will bring much comfort 
to all true soldier

and surly trumpet sing his army dirge 
that fatal music swell his sprightly sense 
more than soft hymn at nuptial 

sir his glory 
be so well know to we we need not urge 
their reputation but it be past my thought 
why on the sudden he shall be compel 
to give his charge up 

when the world believe 
he shall have have a double triumph in 
the honour of his victory 

I will tell you 
there be in prince court a leanfaced monster 
term envy reign in unworthy breast 
to fame heroic son such as know to cringe 
with subtle motion to their prince smile 
adore his footstep and his awful nod 
and can like asp instill into his ear 
a sweet yet kill venom these thin soul 
when the blunt soldier have on pile of wound 
build up his country peace whisper beware 
in time my lord lest he do grow too great 
this meet with the jealous prince fear 
as prince still be fearful of the greatness 
of rise active subject breed resolve to cut up 
that prop lean on which themselves have stand 
firm and unshake on their base and these 
court parasite and the emperor weak distrust 
pull this disgrace on Fridland which if he 
with a effeminate patience do put up 
may all the laurel grow on his crest 
be turn to cypress serve for no use 
but to adorn his funeral 

soft

what do you behold degenerate in my look 
show i unworthy still of that great title 

I will pull my eye out 
shall they convey into my soul a thought 
tend to so much sacrilege to honour 
and perfect masculine virtue 

yet I must 
put off that glorious title like a garment 
old and unfit for wear oh my lord 
our honour individual with our soul 
grow to that essence as to the hand or cheek 
the native whiteness and to have that tear 
lug off by violent torture be a sufferance 
beyond the strength of patience be it not lord

I have to your princely nobleness enjoin i 
under your pardon and with the allowance 
of these brave count your follower to deliver 
my zealous counsel to you 

noble scot 
use your discretion free 

thus great sir then 
though it be in the power of prince to prescribe 
law to their subject it be their subject will 
must put those law in act it be their obedience 
which be the able sinew of the state 
and it be a barbarous cruelty to employ 
their hand against themselves a strange injustice 
to make their proper virtue instrument 
of their own ruin 

colonel Lesle

and too much purpose 

do not lord 
misunderstand my meaning I speak not this 
that I contemn authority or dislike 
order in every thing without preeminence 
in title of command our trade the warfare 
can not subsist but to inform our general 
our too much injure general that it be 
no such strange crime to disobey a prince 
in thing injust and can there be a great 
or shameful injustice than for Caesar 
by his mandate to enforce he to resign 
his glorious charge up 

it be a shame 

a utter a abominable disgrace 
to all that honour virtue shall we suffer it 

here then

of this high consequence do require mature 
deliberation to confirm our own 
strength for the exploit it be fit we do conjoin

to any rule but you which to confirm 
as sure as fate have seal it on your sword 
my council always have have that success 
to be account faithful to my prince

meet treachery with policy and try 
if you the ambitious traitor can surprise

and be consume to ash

a Phisnomy nor as the learned term it

there be some part beneath the waste I take it 
more useful for a man of arm 

good colonel 
no more of this 

shall I ask you 
the reason why you love she you must answer 
it be for the sport as for what other reason 
woman be make unless to prick upon

my hopeful youth which in the active war 
have teach old soldier discipline behold it 
nip by the cold frost of your icy beauty 
as in a fever languish to nothing 
forgetful of the noble pride and strength

to see i still over my foe victorious 
make by myself your captive to insult 
over your suppliant vassal will those eye 
which can contract light orb into a glance 
become impoverish by a smile those cheek 
sully their native tincture shall they blush 
at your mind cruelty it will rather add 
to the illustrious excellence 

my noble lord

there be not a accent issue from your lip 
but have the power shall thunder speak to charm 
to peaceful quiet the affright the world

for heat priority your mountain snow 
cold as the north and cruel as my fortune

by yield up that fort which will when time 
have give it ceremonious privilege be perhaps 
by some unworthy groom without resistance

in man a second nature to deceive 
poor virgin by their flattery noble youth 
that I do love you dear may these tear 
shed for your folly testify look back 
into your princeless honour call that up 
to assist the fortress of your mind assail

to rob a silly orphan of her dowry

to my inheritance shall you despoil i 
of that fair portion by your lust my memory 
will like a early rise bud by that tempest

view bashful virgin point at you as at 
some hateful prodigy hear matron cry 
there go the lustful thief that glory in 
the spoil of innocent virgin that foul thief 
that have a hundred eye to let lust in at 
as many tongue to give his wild thought utterance

this can be a mansion 
for mortal frailty sweet farewell good night 
I will not have my oversaucy love

than to forgo my eye may all the joy 
of healthful slumber crown thy bed thy dream

lest it affright you once more dear good night 
while you with please happy sleep be bless 
I will seek some way to my eternal rest 

the honour you have do i mighty prince 
elector of the sacred roman empire 
by this your personal visit do engage 
so much our gratitude that what ourselves 
and the most able force of our friend 
can in requital act shall be perform 
mutual discourse often mingle soul 
and as the artery convey the blood 
throughout the body they from mind to mind 
convey affection to this end we do 
entreat this meeting that our conference may 
join in a individual league our heart 

this happy treaty glorious duke shall bring 
bless peace once more with turtle wing to soar 
over the German province shall dry 
tear from the eye of mother while the virgin 
shall dedicate their hour to joyful hymn 
in honour of your merit 

the sturdy boor 
shall plough his field in safety and ascribe 
to you great duke that happiness it be you 
who when Bellona thunder through the land 
do stop the steelwinged goddess in her course 
who when our army like a rage flood 
do bear down all before they do oppose 
the greedy torrent bold turn it back 
into its native body and conjoin 
with you so inure to conquest he be less 
than man and more than coward that can fear 
any ensue danger 

you do i too much honour mighty prince 
and now my brave confederate in arm 
where business of import command attendance 
that time be misspend that be spend in useless word 
I shall so please you therefore speak the cause 
in brief which urge i to desire this conference 
and give you reason for my strange revolt 
from my so long love master 

it be the end 
we only come for 

the sole reason 
that draw we to this meeting 

thus in brief then 
how I have serve this emperor these wound 
that beautify my body cause the mark 
of my just loyalty give by your sword 
can bear i righteous witness but good service 
to a malicious and ingrateful prince 
be rather cause of suspect than love 
and when man action do transcend reward 
they then descend to punishment my cause 
be right state thus for when myself 
I well may speak it without partial boast 
have like he eagle in my powerful gripe 
snatch up his crown that lie despise on earth 
and heave it up to heaven bear all the weight 
which you the danish and the Swedish force 
can load these shoulder with nay shake it off 
light as wind in autumn do from tree 
their wither summer garment then even then 
when my just hope be pregnant with conceit 
of wreath and triumph as a brave reward 
my soldier by his mandate be forbid 
to obey i as their general and myself 
command straightway to resign my charge 
all my great power which I have buy with blood 
unto Mathias Gallas my fieldmarshal 

insufferable injury 

inhuman and unheard of ingratitude 

nay more 
as I have be a traitor then in fact 
he do endeavour my surprise to bring i 
a prisoner to Vienna think then lord 
when both my priceless honour and my life 
be at one stake propose if I will not cause 
to play my game with cunning skill when these 
my brave commander from their martial eye 
do for my wrong shed tear of blood call on i 
as on their friend their father not to leave 
my son my soldier if I their request 
perform I save my honour and my life 
but if the emperor I give up they both 
to plain perspicuous ruin yet in not 
accomplish my master harsh command 
the name of treason brand i but pass that 
I of two evil choose to take the least 
rather to draw upon i Caesar hate 
than to forsake my charge and soldier love 
and now be free in my own soul as thought 
unsought to lord and unconstrained I offer 
to assist against this emperor this thing 
make only up of name and voice who we 
will break as shower do bubble which themselves 
of nothing have create 

so welcome 
be this your profess amity no blessing 
heaven in its full bounty can have shower 
can have arrive more please and to show 
how much we prize your friendship your the son 
young Frederick be affiance to my daughter 
the tie of nature to the tie of blood 
will make the union perfect 

it be a honour 
we be bind in duty to accept my lord 
in noble soul no thought shall once admit 
sullen delay our progress shall be swift 
as be the passage of unlimited fire 
in populous city or as wind who force 
do at their birth send open the stubborn womb 
of the dull earth their mother great design 
shall by great spirit only be pursue 
and our last business be our speedy conference 
with chancellor Oxenstern and the french ambassador 
action that carry a unusual weight 
ought still to fly at a unusual height 

So let the dull 
halfspirited soul who strive on rearmouse wing 
by that which fool term honesty to climb 
to the top of honour in their silly virtue 
boast while ingenious and more active spirit 
in a direct line without stop or hindrance 
mount to their wish yet in the worlds esteem 
be hold as real and endue with goodness 
This Wallenstein like a good easy mule 
have I lead on by the nose to this rebellion 
fire with such venom as will spread 
like swift infection through his soul these two 
shall be my agent to achieve my end 
factor in cunning to vent forth my intention 
lieutenant colonel Gordon and my good 
captain butler 

we be muse 
what serious thought it be that can so long 
detain you from our conference 

faith I be study 
on our great general fortune upon which 
our hope and life depend what think you of they 

well at least we be bind 
to hope the best he be in himself so mighty 
he seem above his fate 

his plot do carry 
a fair and specious out side 

it be a sign 
corruption be within they noble friend 
you be my countryman and if my life 
may preserve you from ruin I shall deem it 
religious employ if you discover 
what I intend to utter it will but send 
my age some hour before it be destine minute 
unto my grave and I most willing 
shall die the cause martyr 

by our honour 
no syllable shall ever pass our lip 
what you in love reveal to we 

thus then friend 
rebellion never yet can boast a happy 
or prosperous period wallenstein design 
be build on sand and with the emperor breath 
will be disperse into the air I speak not this 
that I do hate the man heaven know I love 
his person but detest the cause he justify 

true the dignity of prince 
do make whatever quarrel subject raise 
against their sovereign odious 

shall we then 
here in a strange country violate 
the law of hospitality unmake the ancient faith 
ascribe unto our nation by assist 
a traitor against his lawful prince a general 
against that power which give he that command 
betray that royal master to who bounty 
we owe our life first rather let we resolve 
to open all his treason his proceed 
unto our lord the emperor 

it be very just 
and in my judgement requisite 

I do approve it 

it be mere madness 
and he that do mislike it bear no brain 
no soul about he instead of slight preferment 
which shall our general prosper we at best 
can but expect we shall have 
castle lordship earldom nay province 
be style the saviour 
preserver of the empire have our name 
as it be in triumph sing about the street 
in popular acclamation think then friend 
how far these certain honour will surpass 
our aery expectation come let we post 
straight to Vienna and inform the emperor 
of all be proceed in this great affair 
we must not use our fortune but our care exeunt

to have conceal they from you and which most 
torture my loyal thought as it have not be 
sufficient for he to rebel himself 
he have firm a league defensive and offensive 
with your most eager enemy saxon Weimar 
Brandenburg Arheim and Gustavus horn

be of that rough demeanour spite of my 
instruction he will never learn to woe 
in the due phrase and garb 

I do admire 
the fond base carriage of our giddy youth 
in love affair and grieve to see my son 
who shall inherit from i my great spirit 
as well as fortune so degenerate from 
my masculine courage when in the bloom pride 
of my green youth I flourish my desire 
aim always rather in the tent field 
to spend my hour then on a downy couch 
to see the face of a stern enemy besmear with blood 
please i far better than a lady look 

and yet you vow 
ere you win i my lord you never see object 
that so much please your appetite 

perhaps I may 
for the obtain of my end descend 
from my great spirit so much as to decline 
to idle courtship the bird and beast will do it 
to sate their appetite the fiery steed 
that in the fervour of a fight oft time 
neigh courage to his rider when provoke 
with eager heat will lick and bite his female 
into the same desire the sparrow bill 
and with a chirp rhetoric seem to court 
enjoyment of their wish which fulfil 
dull their head they couch beneath their wing 
and in a slumber forfeit all remembrance 
of their past pleasure yet insatiate man
