you shall pardon i there be set of they as there be of fiddler there be first a set of court jeerer spruce halfwitted man confident and fierce in their opinion these be man that make themselves music and their clothes make room for their wit and go before in all company then there be the town jeerer like oboe or waits of the city that think they be wise when they be loud and make a noise when they come to play to distract the next man understanding there be jeerer at time of the year that go down into the country and infect wake and fair and the size with their impudence with which they save charge and be never without the name of a great lord to who they be cousin germane 

but what have he deserve to be call a jeer major and to bear such a title I have see the rook 

a excellent ill nature have prefer he to opinion the other have merit but the name of a jeer minor yet they can see i pleasant in their reproach and laugh in their own defence which many time keep off the cudgel 

nay jeer be a blessing that every man may have if he give his mind to it but wit if I remember what I be teach happen not to one among five hundred on they but I forget my affair

I hope you will excuse my imperfection exeunt 

it be a infinite favour most excellent lady and must needs speak the sweetness of your nature and disposition that you be please to hear i so weak and unworthy of the chair rather deserve to be in the number of disciple than a professor in any of the female science but as your virtue be more exemplary in this honour to i the humble of your servant it will become i in the gratitude to so noble a bounty not to waste time but succinct to deliver what I can not finish without trespass on your patience at my last read I do conclude with old lady that will cozen nature and time and abuse the man they love best to these I only add it be not Mercury to change their skin like snake but they must fill up wrinkle as well as hide grey hair your red leather be for country wench your white wash or spanish fucus be the best but a tire woman or coverer of time or nakedness must be keep in pension for it be now fashionable to buy one of her apprentice girl out of her time as lord and gentleman do barber boy among other ornament ribbon challenge no mean place the variety and blazon of these I have elsewhere examine for your fine lace the angel in cheap but they must be dear than other because they come in coach for pride or stateliness in any thing add charge touch glove may I advise I will have a few select lady to procure some ingenious gentleman at a reasonable pension to lie ledger for they at Rome for frangipani glove and such other correspondent thing as may be of moment and great consequence to your ladyship but then I must advertise and most serious that he may be a man of part and somewhat smell towards the roman wash that he may give you intelligence of that state and humour of the cardinal or those that pretend to it be they little or great for this concern the state lady here for your swarthy mountebank italian he utter sophisticated Holborn glove for frangipani Essex cheese for parmesan rot post for sweet powder pickle white leather for mushroom and cozen more with his break english than the wit can get honest with their best language 

the merchant of italian sausage a meet quack 

but then I will advise your ladyship to have another gentleman send into Spain for perfume pocket fan orange flower water orange flower butter beauty aqua de Chedrey and many provocative as contra yerua and joco lata 

it be a very learned gentlewoman 

for holland it be too dear in Spain therefore for a conscionable cozenage over and above here be honest Dutchman will serve you most faithful for jewel you may buy they at what rate you please they add lustre to a lady and you may sell they at a five or sift part which be very well for a great madam if you will put they off at the best rate you must get some doctor of physic or broke apocryphal captain to show they as if there be fornication in it behind the door hang or curtain which make his finger like jeweller card to set ring on for there be bawd for ring and jewel as well as for other commodity 

what do you think of this caution madam 

for your linen it must be fine and fresh every day therein consist humane delight for linen breech though some think they clean in my opinion they imitate a dutch stove too much for apron plain holland be most become starch lawn be in queen Elizabeth time and will not endure rumple every thing must be square by use and elegance but for your white shoe rich rose lightcoloured silk stocking and such variety below stair they be great inducer as a learned man tell i I will not say a divine for love most excellent lady do sometime ascend as well as descend 
but still remember lady that your fan be so little as not to lose the least smirk or grace of your countenance for it for then be so small when you put it to your face some courtier may take it for a black patch then for your oath I protest be out of fashion I profess for a justice of peace wise I vow too masculine i'faith for a chambermaid introth for a launderer as you hope to live too like a prayer never stir will disadvantage a lady many way beside visit for the active wench of the time may they be damn eternal and lose all their design if it be not so upon my honour sound well which in a great lady can never be forfeit if she be in love for great woman have their privilege of nobility and can never be forswear like the common people 

be perjury in woman no breach of law 

you have the doctor opinion 

one touch if you grow old which I omit former when time which be the moth of beauty creep upon you you must be sure to have so many leaf and curtain before your window that you may show yourselves at more various light than the most cozen mercer his fade and deceitful ware for the youth of your white satin will be then but pearl colour at the best it may be but ashcolour and therefore refuse no advantage to give it gloss accord to the conclusion of a modern poet which at this present shall be i 
wise lady must refuse no art 
for age will snow upon their heart 

you have do we a great honour and lady you shall not deny i this favour to taste of a small banquet that wait upon you in the next room shall I show the way exeunt

observe a i 

such a reverence under your favour will not become man of their gravity one always look for a coranto after it and provoke a man to whistle or sing when he see it and make one think still what you will have a month a little too much of the activity

I can derive myself knave three descent under your ancestor 

then thy child may write themselves knave of blood take that upon my heraldry but have not you brave song then James

that little that she have be crazy 

she have enough to curl and you have the discretion to know what proportion be to be leave out accord to the latitude of her face and to be curl with pin and orris powder which will neither hurt nor break it and then in the morning to let the comb pass through it once and open it between a curl and a freeze and draw up some of the curl with a bodkin within the other hair 

my hair will never endure all this
