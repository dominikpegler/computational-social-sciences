but wretched king thy nuptial knot be death

even in the chapel do thy fancy change 
when perjure man though fair Doll have thy hand

yet fear and love have tie thy ready tongue 
from blab forth the passion of thy mind 
lest fearful silence have in subtle look 
bewray the treason of my new vow love 
be fair and lovely doll but here be the prize 
that lodge here and enter through my eye 
yet howsoever I love I must be wise 
now lovely countess what reward or grace 
may I employ on you for this your zeal 
and humble honour do we in our court 
in entertainment of the english king 

it be of duty prince that I have do 
and what in favour may content i most 
be that it please your grace to give i leave 
for to return unto my country home 

but lovely Ida be your mind the same 

I count of court my lord as wise man do 
it be fit for those that know what long thereto 
each person to his place the wise to art 
the cobbler to his clout the swain to cart 

but Ida you be fair and beauty shine 
and seem best where pomp her pride refine 

if beauty as I know there be none in i 
be swear my love and I his life shall be 
the far from the court I be remove 
the more I think of heaven I be belove 

and why 

because the court be count Venus net 
where gift and vow for stale be often set 
none be she chaste as Vesta but shall meet 
a curious tongue to charm her ear with sweet 

why Ida then I see you set at nought 
the force of love 

in sooth this be my think most gracious king 
that they that little prove 
be much bless from bitter sweet of love 
and we will I wot I hear a shepherd sing 
that like a bee love have a little sting 
he lurk in flower he perch on the tree 
he on king pillow bend his pretty knee 
the boy be blind but when he will not spy 
he have a leaden foot and wing to fly 
beshrew i yet for all these strange effect 
if I will like the lad that so infect 

rare wit fair face what heart can more desire 
but doll be fair and do concern thou near 
let Doll be fair she be win but I must woe 
and win fair Ida there be some choice in two 
but Ida thou be coy 

and why dread king 

in that you will dispraise so sweet 
a thing as love have I my wish 

what then 

then will I place his arrow here 
his beauty in that face 

and be Apollo move and rule by i 
his wisdom shall be you and mine his tree 

but here return our train 
welcome fair doll how fare our father be he ship and go 

my royal father be both ship and go 
God and fair wind direct he to his home 

amen say I will thou be with he too 
then may I have a fit time to woo 
but countess you will be go therefore farewell 
yet Ida if thou will stay thou behind 
to accompany my queen 
but if thou like the pleasure of the court 
or if she like i though she leave the court 
what shall I say I know not what to say 
you may depart and you my courteous queen 
leave i a space I have a weighty cause to think upon 
Ida it nip i near 
it come from thence I feel it burn here 

now be I free from sight of common eye 
where to myself I may disclose the grief 
that have too great a part in my affect 

and now be my time by wile and word to rise 
great than those that think themselves more wise 

and first fond king thy honour do engrave 
upon thy brow the drift of thy disgrace 
thy new vow love in sight of God and man 
link thou to Dorithea during life 
for who more fair and virtuous than thy wife 
deceitful murderer of a quiet mind 
fond love vile lust that thus mislead we man 
to vow our faith and fall to sin again 
but king stoop not to every common thought 
Ida be fair and wise fit for a king 
and for fair Ida will I hazard life 
venture my kingdom country and my crown 
such fire have love to burn a kingdom down 
say Doll dislike that I estrange my love 
be I obedient to a woman look 
nay say her father frown when he shall hear 
that I do hold fair Ida love so dear 
let father frown and fret and fret and die 
nor earth nor heaven shall part my love and I 
yea they shall part we but we first must meet 
and woe and win and yet the world not see it 
yea there be the wound and wound with that think 
so let i die for all my drift be nought 

most gracious and imperial majesty 

a little flattery more be but too much 
villain what be thou that thus dare interrupt a prince secret 

dread king thy vassal be a man of art 
who know by constellation of the star 
by opposition and by dry aspect 
the thing be past and those that be to come 

but where be thy warrant to approach my presence 

my zeal and ruth to see your grace wrong 
make i lament I do detract so long 

if thou know thought tell i what mean I now 

I will calculate the cause of those your highness smile 
and tell your thought 

but lest thou spend thy time in idleness 
and miss the matter that my mind aim at 
tell i what star be opposite when that be think 

it be inconvenient mighty potentate 
who look resemble jove in majesty 
to scorn the sooth of science with contempt 
I see in those imperial look of you 
the whole discourse of love Saturn combust 
with direful look at your nativity 
behold fair Venus in her silver orb 
I know by certain axiom I have read 
your grace grief and further can express her name 
that hold you thus in fancy band 

thou talk wonder 

nought but truth oh king 
it be Ida be the mistress of your heart 
who youth must take impression of affect 
for tender twig will bow and mild mind 
will yield to fancy be they follow well 

what god be thou compose in humane shape 
or bold Trophonius to decide our doubt 
how know thou this 

Even as I know the mean 
to work your grace freedom and your love 
have I the mind as many courtier have 
to creep into your bosom for your coin 
and beg reward for every cap and knee 
I then will say if that your grace will give 
this lease this manor or this patent seal 
for this or that I will effect your love 
but Ateukin be no parasite oh prince 
I know your grace know scholar be but poor 
and therefore as I blush to beg a fee 
your mightiness be so magnificent 
you can choose but cast some gift apart 
to ease my bashful need that can beg 
as for your love o may I be employ 
how faithful will ateukin compass it 
but prince rather trust a smooth tongue 
than man of art that can accept the time 

Ateu if so thy name for so thou say 
thy art appear in entrance of my love 
and since I deem thy wisdom match with truth 
I will exalt thou and thyself alone 
shall be the agent to dissolve my grief 
sooth be I love and Ida be my love 
but my new marriage nip i near Ateukin 
for Dorithea may not brook the abuse 

these let be but as moth against the sun 
yet not so great like dust before the wind 
yet not so light tut pacify your grace 
you have the sword and sceptre in your hand 
you be be the king the state depend on you 
your will be law say that the case be i 
be she my sister who your highness love 
she shall consent for that our life our good 
depend on you and if your queen repine 
although my nature can brook of blood 
and scholar grieve to hear of murderous deed 
but if the lamb shall let the lion way 
by my advice the lamb shall lose her life 
thus be I bold to speak unto your grace 
who be too base to kiss your royal foot 
for I be poor nor have I land nor rent 
nor countenance here in court but for my love 
your grace shall find none such within the realm 

will thou effect my love shall she be i 

I will gather molyrocus and the herb 
that heal the wound of body and the mind 
I will set out charm and spell nought else shall be leave 
to tame the wanton if she shall rebel 
give i but token of your highness trust 

thou shall have gold honour and wealth enough 
win my love and I will make thou great 

these word do make i rich most noble prince 
I be more proud of they then any wealth 
do not your grace suppose I flatter you 
believe i I will bold publish this 
be never eye that see a sweet face 
nor never ear that hear a deep wit 
o God how I be ravish in your worth 

Ateu follow i love must have ease 

I will kiss your highness foot march when you please 

stand back sir i shall stand high 

Come under my arm sir or get a footstool 
or else by the light of the moon I must come to it 

agree my master every man to his height 
though I stand low I hope to get the best master 

ere I will stoop to a thistle I will change turn 
as good luck come on the right hand as the left 
here be for i and i and i 

but tell i fellow till better occasion come 
do you seek master 

we do 

but what can you do worthy preferment 

marry I can smell a knave from a rat 

and I can lick a dish before a cat 

and I can find two fool unsought 
how like you that 
but in earnest now tell i of what trade be you two 

How mean you that sir of what trade 
marry I will tell you I have many trade 
the honest trade when I needs must 
the filch trade when time serve 
the cozen trade as I find occasion 
and I have more quality I can abide a full cup unkissed 
a fat capon uncarved 
a full purse unpicked 
nor a fool to prove a justice as you do 

why sot why call thou i fool 

for examine wise than thyself 

So do many more than I in Scotland 

yea those be such as have more authority than wit 
and more wealth than honesty 

this be my little brother with the great wit wear he 
but what can thou do tell i that be so inquisitive of we 

any thing that concern a gentleman to do that can I do 

so you be of the gentle trade 

true 

then gentle sir leave we to ourselves 
for here come one as if he will lack a servant ere he go 

Ateu why so Ateukin this become thou best 
wealth honour ease and angel in thy chest 
now may I say as many often sing 
no fish to the sea nor service to a king 
unto this high promotion do belong 
mean to be talk of in the thick throng 
and first to fit the humour of my lord 
sweet lay and line of love I must record 
and such sweet line and love lay I will indite 
as man may wish for and my leech delight 
and next a train of gallant at my heel 
that man may say the world do run on wheel 
for man of art that rise by indirection 
to honour and the favour of their king 
must use all mean to save what they have get 
and win their favour who he never know 
if any frown to see my fortune such 
a man must bear a little not too much 
but in good time these bill portend I think 
that some good fellow do for service seek

thy safety and confirm thou to the act 

we will attend your nobleness 

thy credit Bartram in the scottish court 
thy reverend year the strictness of thy vow 
all these be mean sufficient to persuade 
but love the faithful link of loyal heart 
that have possession of my constant mind 
exile all dread subdue vain suspect 
methinks no craft shall harbour in that breast 
where majesty and virtue be install 
methinks my beauty shall not cause my death 

how glad sovereign princess will I err 
and bind my shame to save your royal life 
it be princely in yourself to think the best 
to hope his grace be guiltless of this crime 
but if in due prevention you default 
how blind be you that be forewarn before 

suspicion without cause deserve blame 

who see and shun not harm deserve the same 
behold the tenor of this traitorous plot 

what shall I read perhaps he write it not 

here be his warrant under seal and sign 
to jaques bear in France to murder you 

ah careless king will god this be not thou 
what tho I read ah shall I think it true 

the hand and seal confirm the deed be he 

what know I tho if now he think this 

madam Lucretius say that to repent 
be childish wisdom to prevent 

what tho 

then cease your tear that have dismay you 
and cross the foe before he have betray you 

what need this long suggestion in this cause 
when every circumstance confirm truth 
first let the hide mercy from above 
confirm your grace since by a wondrous mean 
the practice of your danger come to light 
next let the token of approve truth 
govern and stay your thought too much seduce 
and mark the sooth and listen the intent 
your highness know and these my noble lord 
can witness this that while your husband sir 
in happy peace possess the scottish crown 
I be his swear attendant here in court 
in dangerous fight I never fail my lord 
and since his death and this your husband reign 
no labour duty have I leave undo 
to testify my zeal unto the crown 
but now my limb be weak my eye be dim 
my age unwieldy and unmeet for toil 
I come to court in hope for service past 
to gain some lease to keep i be old 
there find I all be upsyturvy turn 
my friend displace the noble loath to crave 
then seek I to the minion of the king 
Ateukin who allure by a bribe 
assure i of the lease for which I seek 
but see the craft when he have get the grant 
he wrought to sell it to sir Silvester 
in hope of great earning from his hand 
in brief I learn his craft and wrought the mean 
by one his needy servant for reward 
to steal from out his pocket all the brief 
which he perform and with reward resign 
they when I read now mark the power of God 
I find this warrant seal among the rest 
to kill your grace who God long keep alive 
thus in effect by wonder be you save 
trifle not then but seek a speedy flight 
God will conduct your step and shield the right 

what shall I do ah poor unhappy queen 
bear to endure what fortune can contain 
ah lass the deed be too apparent now 
but o my eye be you as bend to hide

the realm be rend in twain in such a loss 
and Aristotle hold this for true 
of evil needs we must choose the least 
then better be it that a woman die

and by corruption generation grow 
and contrary maintain the world and state 

enough I be confirm Ateukin come

then may I triumph in the height of joy 
go to my Ida tell she that I vow

can generous heart in nature be so stern 
to pray on those that never do offend 
what though the lion king of brutish race 
through outrage sin shall lamb be therefore slay

because the mighty do gainsay the right 
o English king thou bear in thy breast 
the king of beast that harm not yield one 
the roseal cross be spread within thy field 
a sign of peace not of revenge war 
be gracious then unto this little town

for other that resist kill forage spoil 
my english soldier as you love your king 
revenge his daughter death and do i right

and by descent discover every crime 
my friend I shall lament and you will grieve 
to see the hapless ruin of this realm 

o lawyer thou haste curious eye to pry 
into the secret maim of their estate 
but if thy veil of error be unmask

if your profession have his ground and spring 
first from the law of God then country right

why thrive you by contention why devise you 
clause and subtle reason to except 
our state be first before you grow so great 
a lantern to the world for unity 
now they that be befriend and be rich 
or press the poor come Homer without quoin

to say the poor man cause be good and just 
and yet the rich man gain the best in law 
it be your guise the more the world lament 
to quoin Prouiso to beguile your law 
to make a gay pretext of due proceed 
when you delay your common plea for year 
mark what these deal late here have wrought

you fleece they of their quoin their child beg 
and many want because you may be rich

mark but the guise the poor man that be wrong 
be ready to rebel he spoil he pill 
we need no foe to forage that we have 
the law say they in peace consume we 
and now in war we will consume the law 
look to this mischief lawyer conscience know 
you live amiss amend it lest you end 

good lord that their divine shall see so far 
in other fault without amend they 
sir sir the general default in state 
if you will read before you do correct 
be by a hide work from above 
by their successive change still remain 
be not the law by contrary maintain 
how can the truth from falsehood be discern 
do we not taste the bitterness of war 
how can we know the sweet effect of peace 
do we not feel the nip winter frost 
how shall we know the sweetness of the spring 
shall all thing still remain in one estate
