only to find a climate apt to cherish 
these wither branch but no ground can prove 
so happy ay i none do virtue love 
I will try this soil if here I likewise fade

and as the run woodbine spread her arm 
to choke thy wither bough in their embrace 
I will drive thou from this world be virtue flee

both virtuous soul and vicious do advance 
these shadow of yourselves shall like yourselves 
strive to make man enamour of their beauty 
this grove shall be our temple and henceforth 
be consecrate to our deity 

how few will come and kneel at virtue shrine 

This content virtue that she be call divine 

poor virtue fortune grieve to see thy look 
want cunning to entice why hang these leaf 
as loose as autumn hair which every wind 
in mockery blow from his rot brow 
why like a drunkard be thou point at 
why be this motleyscorn set on thy head 
why stand thy court wide open but none in it 
why be the crystal pavement of thy temple 
not wear not tread upon all be for this 
because thy pride be to wear base attire 
because thy eye flame not with amorous fire 

virtue be fair in a poor array 

poor fool it be not this badge of purity 
nor sibi sapit paint on thy breast 
allure mortality to seek thy love 
no now the great wheel of thy globe have run 
and meet his first point of creation 
on crutch go this world but yesterday 
now it lie bedrid and be grow so old 
that it be grow young for it be a child again 
a childish soul it have it be a mere fool 
and fool and child be well please with toy 
so must this world with show it must be please 
then virtue buy a golden face like vice 
and hang thy bosom full of silver moon 
to tell the credulous world as those increase 
as the bright moon swell in her pearl sphere 
so wealth and pleasure they to heaven shall rear 

virtue abhor to wear a borrow face 

why have thou borrow then that idiot hood 

fool place it on my head that know i not 
and I be proud to wear the scorn of fool 

mourn in that pride and die all the world hate thou 

not all I will wander once more through the world 
wisdom I know have with her bless wing 
flee to some bosom if I meet that breast 
there I will erect my temple and there rest 
fortune nor vice shall then ere have the power 
by their loose eye to entice my paramour 
then will I cast off this deformity 
and shine in glory and triumph to see 
you conquer at my foot that tread on i 

virtue begin to quarrel vice farewell 

stay fortune while within this grove we dwell 
if my angelical and saintlike form 
can win some amorous fool to wanton here 
and taste the fruit of this allure tree 
thus shall his saucy brow adorn be make horn 
to make we laugh 

it will be rare adieu 

foul hellbred fiend virtue shall strive with you 
if any be enamour of thy eye 
their love must needs beget deformity 
man be transform to beast feast with sin 
but if in spite of thou their soul I win 
to taste this fruit though thou disguise their head 
their shape shall be remetamorphose 

I dare thou do thy worst 

my best I will try 

fortune shall judge who win the sovereignty 

the world to the circumference of heaven 
be as a small point in geometry 
who greatness be so little that a less 
can be make into that narrow room 
your quick imagination we must charm 
to turn that world and turn again to part it 
into large kingdom and within one moment 
to carry Fortunatus on the wing 
of active thought many a thousand mile 
suppose then since you last behold he here 
that you have sail with he upon the sea 
and leap with he upon the asian shore 
be feast with he in the Tartar palace 
and all the court of each barbarian king 
from whence be call by some unlucky star 
for happiness never continue long 
help i to bring he back to Arragon 
where for his pride riches make all man proud 
on a slight quarrel by a covetous earl 
fortune dear minion be imprison 
there think you see he sit with fold arm 
tear drop down his cheek his white hair tear 
his leg in rusty fetter and his tongue 
bitter curse that his squinteyed soul 
do not make choice of wisdom sacred love 
fortune to triumph in unconstancy 
from prison bail he liberty be wild 
for be set free he like a lusty eagle 
cut with his venturous feather through the sky 
and light not till he find the turkish court 
thither transport your eye and there behold he 
revel with the emperor of the east 
from whence through fear for safeguard of his life 
fly into the arm of ugly night 
suppose you see he bring to Babylon 
and that the sun clothe all in fire have rid 
one quarter of his hot celestial way 
with the bright morning and that in this instant 
he and the sultan meet but what they say 
listen you the talk of king none dare bewray Exit 

be thou that Fortunatus who great name 
be carry in the chariot of the wind 
have fill the court of all our asian king 
with love and envy who dear presence tie 
the eye of admiration to thy eye 
be thou that jove that in a shower of gold 
appear before the turkish emperor 

I be that Fortunatus mighty sultan 

where be that purse which throw abroad such treasure 

I give it to the turkish Soliman 
a second I bestow on Prester john 
a three the great tartarian cham receive 
for with these monarch have I banquet

while thou seem but a star to Agrippina

o call this madness in see from the window 
of every eye derision thrust out cheek 
wrinkle with idiot laughter every finger

by which thy name be hurt thy honour tear

Even at thou 

ha ha I laugh at they be not they mad 
that let my true true sorrow make they glad 
I dance and sing only to anger grief 
that in that anger he may smite life down 
with his iron fist good heart it seem then 
they laugh to see grief kill i oh fond man 
you laugh at other tear when other smile 
you tear yourselves in piece vile vile vile 
ha ha when I behold a swarm of fool 
crowd together to be count wise 
I laugh because sweet Agripine be not there 
but weep because she be not anywhere 
and weep because whether she be or not 
my love be ever and be still forget forget forget forget 

draw back this stream why shall my Orleans mourn 

look yonder Galloway do thou see that sun 
nay good friend stare upon it mark it well 
ere he be two hour elder all that glory 
be banish heaven and then for grief this sky 
that be now so jocund will mourn all in black 
and shall not Orleans mourn alack alack 
oh what a savage tyranny it be 
to inforce care laugh and woe not shed a tear 
dead be my love I be bury in her scorn 
that be my sunset and shall I not mourn 
yes by my troth I will 

dear friend forbear 
beauty like sorrow dwell everywhere 
race out this strong idea of her face 
as fair as she shine in any place 

thou be a traitor to that white and red 
which sit on hex cheek be Cupid throne 
be my heart sovereign oh when she be dead 
this wonder beauty shall be find in none 
now Agrippina be not i I vow to be 
in love with nothing but deformity 
o fair deformity I muse all eye 
be not enamour of thou thou do never 
murder man heart or let they pine like wax 
melt against the sun of thy destiny 
thou be a faithful nurse to chastity 
thy beauty be not like to Agrippina 
for care and age and sickness she deface 
but thou be eternal oh deformity 
thy fairness be not like to Agrippina 
for dread her beauty will no beauty have 
but thy face look most lovely in the grave 

see where they come together hand in hand 

o watch sweet Galloway when their hand do part between they shall thou find my murder heart 

by this then it seem a thing impossible to know when a english lady love true 

not so for when her soul steal into her heart and her heart leap up to her eye and her eye drop into her hand then if she say here be my hand she be your own else never 

here be a pair of your prisoner let we try their opinion 

my kind prisoner well encounter the prince of Cyprus here and myself have be wrangle about a question of love my lord of Orleans you look lean and like a lover whether be it more torment to love a lady and never enjoy she or always to enjoy a lady who you can choose but hate 

to hold she ever in my arm who I loathe in my heart be some plague yet the punishment be no more than to be enjoin to keep poison in my hand yet never to taste it 

but say you shall be compel to swallow the poison 

then a speedy death will end a speed misery but to love a lady and never enjoy she o it be not death but worse than damnation it be hell it be 

no more no more good Orleans nay then I see my prisoner be in love too 

methinks soldier can fall into the fashion of love 

methinks a soldier be the most faithful lover of all man else for his affection stand not upon compliment he woo be plain homespun stuff there be no outlandish thread in it no rhetoric a soldier cast no figure to get his mistress heart his love be like his valour in the field when he pay downright blow 

true madam but will you receive such payment 

no but I mean I love a soldier best for his plain deal 

that be as good as the first 

be it so that goodness I like for what lady can abide to love a spruce silken face courtier that stand every morning two or three hour learning how to look by his glass how to speak by his glass how to sigh by his glass how to court his mistress by his glass I will wish he no other plague but to have a mistress as brittle as glass 

and that be as bad as the horn plague 

be any lover possess with this madness 

what madman be not possess with this love yet by my troth we poor woman do but smile in our sleeve to see all this foppery yet we all desire to see our lover attire gallant to hear they sing sweet to behold they dance comely and such like but this apish monkey fashion of effeminate niceness out upon it o I hate it worse than to be count a scold 

indeed man be most regard when they least regard themselves 

and woman most honour when they show most mercy to their lover 

but be it not a miserable tyranny to see a lady triumph in the passion of a soul languish through her cruelty 

methinks it be 

methinks it be more than tyranny 

so think not I for as there be no reason to hate any that love we so it be madness to love all that do not hate we woman be create beautiful only because man shall woo they for it be miserable tyranny to enjoin poor woman to woo man I will not hear of a woman in love for my father kingdom 

I never hear of any woman that hate love

always to swim up to the chin in gold 
be what he can be if those dote fire

breathe life in our numb spirit with one smile 
and from this cold earth we with lively soul 
shall rise like man newborn and make heaven sound 
with hymn sing to thy name and prayer that we 
may once a year so oft enjoy this sight 
till these young boy change their curl lock to white 
and when graywinged age sit on their head 
that so their child may supply their stead 
and that heaven great arithmetician 
who in the scale of number weigh the world 
may still to forty two and one year more 
and still add one to one that go before 
and multiply four ten by many a ten 
to this I cry amen 

amen amen 

good night dear mistress those that wish thou harm 
thus let they stoop under destruction arm 

amen amen amen exeunt
