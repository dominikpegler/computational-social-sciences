and spit their fury in the face of heaven 
be now lay low in dust 

dread sovereign 
the heaven have show their bounty unto we 
in guard your most dear and sacred life 
from opposite hatred and that imminent peril 
to which you be engage 

when in one battle you be twice unhorse 
gird with the opposite rank of infidel 
that have not timely rescue come from heaven 
mortal assistance have be use in vain 

ay now you load i with a surplusage 
of compiless debit this thrice valiant lord 
my noble marshal twice that perilous day 
do he bestride i and beneath his targe 
methinks that instant do I lie as safe 
as in my best and strong citadel 
the while his bright sword like the bolt of jove 
pierce the steelcrest of barbarous infidel 
and flat they with earth although my subject 
yet in this one thing thou have prove my lord 
for when my life be forfeit to the war 
thou by thy valour do redeem it free 
and give it i while thou engage thy life 
for which if ever by like chance of war 
law forfeiture or our prerogative

by our earth honour and our hope divine 
as thou for we we will we engage for thou 

you give my lord to duty attribute 
too high for her submiss humility 
I be your vassal and ten thousand life 
of equal rank with i subject and servant 
be overrate if compare with you 

when I forget thou may my operant part 
each one forget their office we create thou 
next to ourself of power we but except 
the name of king all other dignity 
we will communicate to thou our friend 

may I no long use these Royaltiy 
or have the power to enjoy they then I whole 
devote they to your service 

noble marshal 
if I survive England inheritance 
or ever live to sit on jacob stone 
thy love shall with my crown be hereditary 

and gracious prince since heaven have be as liberal 
to grace i with your favour as my birth

be ever to your virtue serviceable 

we know it and have be observer long 
of thy choice virtue neither can we yet 
fasten that love on thou which come not home 
with double use and ample recompense 

these grace be beyond dimension 
they have nor height nor depth uncircumscribed 
and without bound he like abroad arm tree 
overshadow we and throw his spacious bow 
we that grow under can see the sun 
nor taste the cheerful warmth of his bright beam 
these branch we must lop by fire or thunder 
or by his shadowy arm be still keep under 

I be bear eaglefighted and to gaze 
in the sun forehead I will brook no cloud 
to stand betwixt i and his glorious fire 
I will have full light or none either soar high 
or else sink low my ominous fate be cast 
or to be first or of all abject last 

you shall renown martial feast for we 
the ambassador that come from foreign land 
to gratulate our famous victory 

I shall my lord and give they entertainment 
to England honour and to suit the place 
of which I bear the name 

we doubt it not 
we understand lord in these tedious war 
some forward spirit have be at great expense 
to furnish they like noble gentleman 
and many spend most part of their revenue 
in honour of their country some undo 
in pursuit of these war now if such come 
for their relief by suit petitionary 
let they have gracious hear and supply 
or by our service or our treasury 

I have one kinsman have spend all his land 
and be return a beggar and so totter 
as that I can but blush to acknowledge he 
but in the war he spend it and for i 
war shall relieve he he be a noble heir 
but what these lose let other war repair 

lord all once more we greet your safe return 
with general welcome we invite you all 
to feast with we and joy what we have win 
happy in these our marshal and our son 

it seem thou have not be in the war my friend but be new come up to London 

heaven bless thou from all his mercy and his grace it be tell we in Wales that you have great pig organ in Paul and big by a great deal than our organ at Rixam which make i make my travel and my journey on the pair hoof up to London to have resolution and certification in that business that when I venture into my country and habitation I may give notice to my uncle rice ap Davy ap Morgan ap Evan ap jones ap Geffrey I pray where about stand Paul church can you tell she 

Overy easy stand with thy face that way and follow thy nose and thou will be there present but do thou hear Briton take my word our organ of Paul be much big and better than you of Rixam by as much as Paul church be big and better than saint Pancridge 

awe man you prittle and prattle nothing but leasing and untruth now will you but ease your posterior a little and I will quick show you your organ of Paul 

very good I like your demonstration well but do thou think your organ of Rixam can compare with we for all that 

lend i but your ear and your apprehension and I will make you easy to acknowledge your error 

but first show i your case in which you carry your two pair of organ sure those flop will not hold they but in the mean time walk with i to the next red lettuce and I will give thou two can and wet thy organpipe well I warrant thou 

I will take your courtesy and if ever I shall meet you in Glamorgan or Rednockshire I will make bold to requite some part of your kindness 

the very noise of that horn have fright my courtesy but all be one farewell for this time and at our next meet ten to one I will be as good as my word 

say you so man why then God keep you from all his mercy and good fortune and make we all his servant 

Come we will to the chase be near we marshal 
I will try today which of our two good steed 
can speed it best let the most swift take both 

so please your grace but I shall sure lose 
you be the best for proof though i for show 

that will we try the wager grow not deep 
equal the lay and what we win we will keep 
mount mount 

great and great still no plot no trick 
to have he quite remove from the king grace 
to slander he 

the king will lend no ear 
to any just complaint that be make of he 
what can our scandal do then 

challenge he 
of treason then and that may haply call 
his loyalty into suspect and question 
which in the king at least will breed a coldness 
if not a deadness of affection 

of treason say he crave the combat then 
for that be the least he can which of we two 
shall combat he I know his blow too well 
not I 

I shall be loath 

how do you relish this 
his virtue and his bounty win he grace 
on that we will build to ruin all his favour 
and work he to disgrace 

pray teach i how 

first praise he to the king give all his virtue 
double their due add unto every thing 
ay and hyperbolize in all his deed 
let his know virtue be the common theme 
of our discourse to stale he rate his worth 
to equalise if not to exceed the king 
this can but beget distaste at least 

but further 

thus then fall off from his praise 
and question his best deed as it may be 
his noble bounty be but popular grace 
and his humility but inward pride 
his vulgar suffrage and applause abroad 
a way to climb and seat himself aloft 
you understand i 

full come to horse 
and as we ride our further plot digest 
to find what may disturb what aid we best 

spur to the king his steed be unshod before 
the way be stony and he will spoil his beast 
here take these shoe and hammer bring of purpose 
for my own use 

my lord have you pluck the shoe off from your own horse to set they on another a thousand to one but you will spoil your own gelding quite 

no matter do as I command thou sirrah 
hollow he straight I know he love that horse 
and will not ride he bare for any gold 

your horse be as good as he I be sure and I think you love he as well 

no matter if he ask thou where thou have they 
tell he thou bring they with thou for my use 
away I will gallop after and overtake thou 

put your shoe on another horse foot and let your own go barefoot a jest indeed 

the king affect both his good horse and game I will help to further both 

you have fetch i up at length that be to your fortune 
or my misfortune for I lose a shoe 
Martial you ride well furnish to the field 

my lord so horseman shall and I be glad 
my man be so well furnish and the rather 
since we be far from help my man be cunning 
your highness to his skill may trust your horse 

thou can not have present i a gift 
I can have taste better for that beast 
I much esteem you be outstrip at length 

till I be force to alight my horse with you keep equal speed 

our lord now gentleman 
how do you like the chase 

it be excellent 

have not my horse be by mischance unshod 
my marshal here and I have lead you still 

you be the better horse 

and you the worst 
witness the hugeness of your way behind 
be not my horse yet shod 

he be my lord 

then let we mount again 

your horse my lord be not in state to ride 
he want two shoe before 

who do the marshal 

oft such mischance happen 

be you furnish 
for we and for yourself keep no supply 

so I may have my lord to furnish you 
I care not how myself want 

apprehension help i for every circumstance apply 
thou have do i a unwonted courtesy 
you spy my loss first 

I do my lord 

and then alight 

true 

upon my life it be so 
to unshoe thy own good steed and furnish i 
be it not upon thy life resolve i true 

what I have do my lord I do to you 

you will exceed i still and yet my courtesy 
shall rank with thou for this great duty show 
I pay thou thus both steed be now thy own 

they wager love 

the best thing I can do 
in i be duty the worst grace in you 

the be we come mount we will return to court 
to order the great tournament prepare 
to do our son grace in which we entreat 
marshal your aid because your skill be great 

we have visit all our familiar be it not now time that we revisit our captain 

with all my heart good corporal but it have not be amiss if we have go to Burchenlane first to have suit we and yet it be a credit for a man of the sword to go threadbare because by his apparel he may be take to be a old soldier 

Cocke thy father be a fresh water soldier thou be not thou have be powder witness thy flax and touchbox 

but who come yonder my match I be glad I have meet thou 

I know cock at one time or other thou will meet with thy match what shall we go to my captain lodging 

spare that pain yonder he appear in his colour 

Fortun' de la guere I that have flourish no colour like i nay no trumpet thou in his high key have nothing now but rag to flourish I that have face the enemy have not so much as any face leave i be my suit but as well point as I have see some and stand I but in the midst of my follower I may say I have nothing about i but tag and rag I be descend noble for I be descend so low that all the clothes of my back be scarce worth a noble I be bear to thousand and yet a thousand to one they will now scarce acknowledge i where I be bear 

health to our worthy captain 

thank my most worthy soldier and yet if I shall examine your worth what at the most can all you make 

I will not have your worship to examine our outside 

and for your inside I will pass my word 

can all your worship credit afford you a new suit 

credit i no my revenue be a thousand a year part of which I lavish among gallant riot in tavern havoc in ordinary and when my estate begin to ebb as my last refuge I lay all my hope upon the last war but fail there as the world imagine I be return as you see the king have promise supply and relief to all that have spend their estate in his expedition but many like myself have be bear to be poor that scorn to be beggar as many have be bear to be rich that can never leave it the truth be I be myself as my proceed will express i further 

will you cashier we captain or shall we follow your future fortune 

you shall not leave i my purpose be to try the humour of all my friend my ally my ancient associate and see how they will respect i in my suppose poverty though I lose their acquaintance I will lose none of my retinue How say you gentleman will you copart with i in this my dejectedness 

as I be corporal so will I prove true squire to thy body 

and as I be true cock so will I crow at thy service wait on thou with a comb for thy head with fire to thy piece with water to thy hand and be cock sure in any employment whatsoever 

and as I be true match I shall scorn that any of they shall overmatch i in duty 

attend i then if I rise you shall ascend if fall I will lie flat with you first then I will make some trial of my friend at the court and in good time here be the king 

you have persuade much and I begin 
to censure strange of his emulous love 

further my lord what can his smoothness mean 
his courtesy and his humility 
but as fly bait to catch the people heart 
and wean they from your love 

do he not strive 
in all thing to exceed your courtesy 
of purpose to outshine your royal deed 
and daze I your brightness that himself may shine 
be he not only popular my liege 
be not the people suffrage sole to he 
while they neglect your fame his train do equal 
if not exceed you still his chamber throng 
with store of suitor where the marshal lie 
there be the court all eye be bend on he 
and on his glory there be no theme abroad 
but how he save you from the pagan sword 
how his sole hand sway guide and guard the realm 

think but my lord on his last game at chess 
it be his past odds but when he see you move 
with what a sly neglect he lose the mate 
only to make you bind to he 

for all the favour grace honour love 
bestow upon he from your bounteous hand 
his cunning be to think to quit you all 
and pay you with a horseshoe 

in the tournament 
make by the prince your son when he be peerless 
and without equal this ambitious marshal 
strive to exceed and do but when he see 
your highness move to see the prince disgrace 
he lose the prize but how that all the people 
may see it give not forfeit which do add 
rather than derogate brief my lord 
his courtesy be all ambition 

and well it may be be he not our vassal 
why shall the marshal then contend with we 
to exceed in any virtue we observe he 
his popularity how affable 
he be to the people his hospitality 
which add unto his love his forwardness 
to entertain ambassador and feast they 
which though he do it upon his proper charge 
and for our honour yet it may be think 
a smoothness and a cunning to grow great 
it must be so a project we intend 
to prove he faithless or a perfect friend 

it take these jealous thought we must pursue 
and to his late doubt still add something new 

your speech be end now come in my cue 
my honourable lord 

what beggar be this 

beggar my lord I never beg of you 
but be I a beggar I may be a courtier fellow 
can I beg suit my lord as well as you 
I need not go thus clad or be you free 
from beg as I be you may rank i 

comparison away 

folly and pride 
in silk and lace their imperfection show 
but let pure virtue come in garment tear 
to beg relief she get a courtly scorn 
my lord you know i 

I have see that face 

why it be the same it be it be no changeling 
it bear the selfsame front it be not like you 
pale with the least disgrace or pass with brag 
that smile upon gay clothes and frown on rag 
i be steadfast as the sun and free as fate 
who equal eye look upon want and state 

and do not i so too pray what be your business 

only that you will know i the king favour have make you a baron and the king war have make i a bare one there be less difference in the accent of the word than in the cost of our weed this be the same face you be once acquaint with though not the same habit I can know your face though your disease body be wrap in sheepskin 

this fellow offend i 

go churl pass free thou know my forfeit land though forget i nay you will be go too you be as afraid of a tear suit as a young brother of a sergeant a rich cornmaster of a plentiful year or a troublesome attorney to hear of suit put to compromise 
sir I must challenge you you be my kinsman 
my grandsire be the first that raise the name 
of Bonvile to this height but lord to see 
that you be grow a lord and know not i 

cousin I know you you have be a unthrift 
and lavish what you have have I so do 
I may have ebb like you where I now flow 

yet I can purchase that which all the wealth you have will never win you 

and what be that I pray 

wit be the word strange to you wit 

whither will thou 

true 
wit will to many ere it come to you 

feed you upon your purchase I will keep i 

have you the wit to do it 

I have wit to buy 
and you to sell which be the great gain 
cousin I will keep my wealth keep you your brain 

the wealth of Midas choke thou ere thou be old 
and even the bread thou feed on change to gold 
my lord you hear how I pray for my kindred 
I have a little more charity for my friend with you 
I have some business 

I be in haste now 

I pray you stay 

not now indeed 

pardon for here be no way 
before you hear i 

prithee be brief 

your daughter live I hope 

what be that to thou 

somewhat it will prove ay and concern i 
before I lay my fortune on these war 
And be in hope to thrive by your consent 
nay by your motion our unite heart 
be make more firm by contract well you know 
we be betroth 

sir I remember it not 

I do and thus proceed 
I be in hope to have raise my fortune high 
and with they to have pull she by degree 
unto that eminence at which I aim 
I venture for it but instead of wealth 
I purchase nought but wound honour I have 
and the repute of valour but my lord 
these simple of themselves be naked title 
respectless without price and bombast wealth 
and to the purblind world show seem bad 
behold in i their shape they thus go clad 

you say you will be brief 

all that I have 
I spend upon my soldier we take no spoil 
the war have grate on i even to this 
that you now see now my last refuge be 
to raise myself by she 

and spend her mean 
as thou have do thy own vile unthrift no 
I know no contract 

I have one to show 

no matter think thou that I will vent my bag 
to suit in satin he that jet in rag 

the world be all of one heart this blaze I can 
all love the money none esteem the man 
these be our friend at court and fine one too 
be they not pray where be our follower 

here noble captain 

you see how our friend grace we what hope we have to prefer you 

I see sufficient captain I will discharge myself I mean to seek elsewhere for preferment

captain I desire your pass I mean to march along with my corporal 

will thou go to 

I leave you who I for a little diversity for a wet storm no sir though your outside fall away I will cleave as close to you as your lining 

gramercy yet away without reply 

foutre for thy base service 

away 'sfoot how be I fall out of my humour and yet this strangeness of my near friend and alliance deserve a little contemplate be it possible that even lord that have the best educate who ear be frequent to the most fluent discourse that live in the very brain of the land the court that these shall be gull with shadow and not be able to distinguish a man when they see he thou know i yet these do not 

why may not a poor man have as good eye as another their ear indeed may be large than i but I can see as far without spectacle as the best lord in the land 

these superficial lord that think every thing to be as it appear they never question a man wit his discretion his language his inward virtue but as he seem he pass 

I warrant if I shall look like a ass 
they will take i for one too 

the next I try be my betroth if she acknowledge this hand that have receive she this heart this face and know the person from the garment I shall say woman there be more virtue in thou than man 

there be no question of that for they say they will hold out better but sir if we be no better habit I make a question how we shall get in at the courtgate for I will assure you your fashion be not in request at the court 

my virtue be not to be imitate I will hold my purpose though I be keep back and venture lash in the porter lodge Come follow i I will go see my mistress though gird with all the lady of the court 
though ragged virtue oft may be keep out 
no grate so strong keep above the centre 
but ass with gold lade free may enter 

lord marshal we be much in debt to you 
for by your favour we obtain the prize 
in the last tourney we acknowledge it 

I can not love my sovereign gracious prince

you make the lady blush 

why to change face 
they say in modest maid be sign of grace 
yet many that like she hold down the head 
will never change colour when they be once in bed 

you will put the lady out of countenance quite 

not out of heart for all of her complexion 
show in their face the fire of their affection 
and even the modest wife this know we too 
oft blush to speak what be no shame to do

while your allegiance hold what need you more 
you ever shall be noble although poor

that appear such 

Indeed so worldling say 
but virtuous man prove they be only dear 
that all their riches can about they bear 

be not earl Chester 
return yet with a answer from the marshal 

not yet my lord 

for such contention we now scorn revenge 
we will try the utmost of his patience now 
he will exceed our love if it appear 
he will hold nothing for his king too dear 

earl Chester be return 

have bring she Chester 

her who her father the most fair esteem 
he have send by i only with this request 
that if his free gift do not like your highness 
you will send she back untouched to his embrace 

I fear we shall not she appear too fair 
so straight to part with what be he will 
attempt such virginmodesty to stain 
by hope of honour flattery or constraint 
how do you like she your opinion lord 

a beauteous lady one that have no peer 
in the whole court 

therefore I hold her precious 

a fair face in court whoever see 
her beauty will become the name of queen 

one of more state or shape where shall we find 

her modesty do do her beauty grace 
both in her cheek have chuse a sovereign seat 

you have pass censure lady now you be i 
and by your father free gift you be so 
to make or mar to keep or bestow 

it glad i I be present to a king 
who I have always hear my father term 
royal in all thing virtuous modest chaste 
and to have one free attribute beside 
which even the great emperor need not scorn 
honest to you if you be such my liege 
a virgin love I prostrate and a heart 
that wish you all goodness with the duty 
of a true subject and a noble father 
then mighty prince report your subject noble 
since all those virtue you receive in i 

thou have overcome we all that thou have term we 
we will strive to be and to make good those attribute 
thou have bestow upon we rise our queen 
thy virtue have take off the threaten edge 
of our intend hate though thou be we 
both by free gift and duty which we challenge 
as from a subject though our power can stretch 
to thy dishonour we proclaim thou free 
and in this grace thy father we exceed 

the king in this show honour prince still 
shall be the lord of their own appetite 
and cherish virtue 

have I your applause 

your highness show both royalty and judgement 
in your fair choice 

be your opinion so 

far be it mighty king we shall distaste 
where you so well affect 

for grace and feature 
England afford not a more complete virgin 

be she not the marshal daughter 
I will term her worthy for my sovereign bride 

ay that be the grief 

This kiss then be the seal 
thou be our queen and now be only i 

may I become your vassal and your handmaid 
title but equal to my humble birth 
but since your grace a high title deign 
envy must needs obey where power compel 
Give expeditious order for the rite 
of these our present nuptial which shall be 
do with all state and due solemnity 
and marshal in this business thou shall find 
thyself defective and not we unkind 

health to your highness 

from my sad master 
your marshal once now your deject vassal 
and thus he bid i say if the king deign 
to grace my daughter with the style of queen 
to give you then this casket which contain 
a double dower half of this mighty sum 
he out of his revenue have afford 
have she be match but to a baron bed 
but since your highness deign she for your bride 
and his alliance scorn not to disdain 
he say a double dower be due to you 

he strive to exceed we still this emulation 
beget our hate and question he of life 
this dower we take his daughter entertain 
but he we never shall receive to grace 
bear not from we so much as love or thanks 
we only strive in all our action 
to be hold peerless for our courtesy 
and royal bounty which appear the worse 
since he a subject will precede his prince 
and do we not his daughter dear love 
we will send she back with scorn and base neglect 
but she we love though he in heart despise 
pay he that thank for all his courtesy 

in this employment I will strive to do 
the office of a subject and of servant too

have still report you royal in all 
by who the virtuous rise that the ignoble fall 

I have not see a lady more complete 
her modesty and beauty both be matchless 

be I a king and must be exceed still 
or shall a subject say that we can owe 
his bounty we will equal and exceed 
we have power to better what in he be but well 
your free opinion lord be not this lady 
the fair of the twain how dare our subject 
than dally with we in that high design 

with pardon of the queen she be parallel 
by her fair sister 

Were my censure free 
I dare say better 

be it put to i 
I shall avow she not the queen alone 
excel in grace but all that I have see

how say you lord have we requite well 
our subject bounty be we in his debt

and bountiful beyond comparison 

this must not hold prevention out of hand 
for if the marshal rise we stand not long 

our wit must then to work 

they must of force 
this be not that to which our fortune trust 

let then our subject know his king have power 
to vanquish he in all degree of honour 
and he must now confess himself excel 
with what can heaven or earth his want supply 
to equal this our late courtesy

in all degree of love and courtesy 

for our queen love and our fair daughter sake 
we do not much care if we grant he that 
admit he and his presence urge with speed 
well may he imitate but not exceed 

I fear our fall if once the marshal rise 
down down must we 

therefore devise some plot 
his favour to prevent 

leave it to i 

lord we be proud of this our unity 
double alliance of our son fair choice 
since it be applaud by your general voice 
the rather since so matchless be our grace 
that force perforce our subject must give place 

not to contend but to express a duty 
of zeal and homage I present your grace 
with a rich jewel which can only value 
these royal honour to my daughter do 

value our bounty shall thou sell thyself 
even to thy skin thou can not rate it true

though not in satisfaction I make bold 
to tender you this present 

what be the project 
here be cost and art and ample both express 
I have not view the like

I have not see a model rich frame 

or for the quantity better contrive 
this lord in all his action be still noble 
exceed all requital 

it be a brave outside 

this that you see my lord be nothing yet 
more than its worth it have commend be 
this be the case the jewel lie within 
please your grace to unveil it 

yes I will 
but ere I open it my lord I doubt 
the wealth within not equal that without 

what have we here 

a jewel I shall rate 
be it i own above your crown and sceptre 

a child 

a prince one of your royal blood 
behold he king my grandchild and thy son 
true descend from thy queen and thou 
the image of thyself 

how can this be 

my royal liege and husband view he well 
if your own favour you can call to mind 
behold it in this infant limn to the life 
he be you and i no kindred can be near 

to this rich jewel I hold nothing equal 
I know thou virtuous and thy father loyal 
but shall I doubt both yet this royal infant 
have such affection in my heart impress 
that it assure he i my noble subject 
thou have at length overcome i and I now 
shall ever ever hold i vanquish 
have thou seek earth or sea and from they both 
extract that which be most precious hold 
thou nothing can have find to equal this 
this the mix image of my queen and i 
here then shall all my emulation end 
overcome by thou our subject and our friend 

your vassal and your servant that have strive 
only to love you and your royal favour 
not to requite for that I never can 
but to acknowledge and in what I may 
to express my gratitude 

thou be the conquest 
but shall I give it over thus it be in my head 
how I this lose day honour shall regain 
a gift as great as rich I have in store 
with which to gratify our subject love 
and of a value unrequitable 
thou have give i a grandchild and a son 
a royal infant and to i most dear 
yet to surpass thou in this emulous strife 
I give thou here a daughter and a wife 
now must thou needs confess the conquest win 
by i thy king thy father and thy son 

your father son and subject quite surpass 
yield himself vanquish and overcome at length 

you have not my consent yet 

madam no 
the king do this his bounty to express 
your love be to yourself and therefore free 
bestow it where you please 

why then on thou 
he that the father do so much respect 
shall not methinks the daughter love despise 
it be good for maid take husband when they may 
heaven know how long we may be force to stay 

now lord these nuptial we will solemnize 
in all high state in which we will include 
you noble Bonvile and with mask and revel 
sport out the tedious night each hand his bride 
double by we from either part ally 

why this be as it shall be now do I smell courtier already I feel the soldier steal out of i by degree for soldier and courtier can hardly dwell both together in one bosom I have a kind of fawn humour creep upon i as soon as I but look into the courtgate and now can I take a bribe if any will be so foolish to give it i now farewell gunpowder I must change thou into damaskpowder for if I offer but to smell like a soldier the courtier will stop their nose when they pass by i my cask I must change to a cap and a feather my bandillero to a scarf to hang my sword in and indeed fashion myself whole to the humour of the time my piece I must alter to a poynado and my pike to a pickadevant only this be my comfort that our provant will be better here in the court than in the camp there we do use to lie hard and seldom here I must practise to lie extreme and often but while I be trifle here I shall lose the fight of the solemnity the prince be marry and the marshal be marry and my master be marry there will be simple do at night well I must hence for I believe the king the queen and the rest of the lord will use this place for their revel Dixi 

and why so sad my lord 

I be all dulness 
there be no life in i I have lose my spirit 
and fluence of my brain observe you not 
in what a height you fellow now reside 
that be so late deject treble graft 
into the royal blood what can succeed 
but that we all our honour must resign 
and he of they be repossess again 

the marriage indeed be celebrate 

and they have all our point stratagem 
turn back upon ourselves 

what no prevention 

his base be so fix he can shrink 
be so many way engraft and plant 
in the king blood but our supporter stand 
as shake with earthquake or else build on sand 

my lord attend the king and clear this chamber 
for this night revel it be the place prepare 

your duty lord the king be upon his entrance

usher the queen and lady be their guide 
that do each one to bed with his fair bride 

I be so high that when I look but down 
to see how far the earth be under i 
it quake my body and quite chill my blood 
and in my fear although I stand secure 
I be like he that fall I but a subject 
and marry to the daughter of the king 
though some may think i happy in this match 
to i it be fearful who will have a wife 
above he in command to embrace with awe 
who to displease be to distaste the king 
it be to have a mistress not a wife 
a queen and not a subject bedfellow 
state I can wish abroad to crown my head 
but never yet love empire in my bed

which in these loyal all arm this night shall sleep 
that be the king with that this jewel too 
I think her cheap buy at that easy rate

I count my virtue treasure not my gold 

what not at rest my lord 

why who can sleep 
that have a labour brain and see from far 
so many storm and tempest threaten he 
it be not in my element to do it 

find you no project yet how to remove he 

None none and therefore can I find no rest 

it grow towards day 

that day be night to i 
while you sun shine I have this even some conference 
in private with the king in which I urge 
the marshal discontent withal infer 
that by his look the princess he despise 
the king change face and can we second this 
by any new conjecture there be hope 
to draw he in displeasure 

watch advantage 
and as you find the humour of the king 
work it unto the marshal deep disgrace 
but soft the prince 

so early up how do you like your rest 

I find my most rest in my most unrest 
a little sleep serve a new marry man 
the first night of his bridal I have make you 
a woman of a maid 

you be up 
both late and early 

why you be abroad 
before the sun be up and the most wise 
do say it be healthful still betimes to rise 
good day 

in one ten thousand 

lord you have not see 
the king today it be his custom ever 
still to be stir early with the sun 
but here be his majesty 

not all your smooth and cunning oratory 
can colour so his pride but we esteem he 
a flatter traitor one that scorn our love 
and in disdain send back our daughter dower 
your judgement lord 

have he refuse the princess 

no but her dower send back and insolent 
her who we give he with a gift will buy 
a jewel shall we merchandise our daughter 
as one not able to bestow she noble 
but that our poverty must force we sell she 

your highness much misprise his intent 
for he have no such thought 

we know his pride 
which his ambition can no long shadow 

your highness may do well to call in question 
his insolence and to arraign he for it 

be you his judge Bonvile Audley you 
command he straight on his allegiance 
to make appearance and to answer we 
before our lord of his contempt and scorn 

shall we command he hither 

from his bed 
and if convict he shall sure pay for it 

we shall my lord 

arraign he on the sudden ere it prove 
le he not dream upon evasive shift 
but take he unprepared 

shall we command 
a bar and call a jury of his peer 
while Chester that enjoy the place of marshal 
object such allegation against his life 
as he have draw out of his rude demeanour 

it shall be so a bar and instant 
we will ourself in person hear he speak 
and see what just excuse he can produce 
for his contempt 

my gracious lord and father 
what he have do to you proceed of honour 
not of disdain or scorn he be true noble 
and if a regal bounty be a sin 
in any subject he be only guilty 
of that true virtue 

see your majesty 
with what a humble zeal and prostrate love 
he do retender your fair daughter dower 
you will not his intent thus misreceive 

it be humble pride and mere hypocrisy 
to blind the king it be but ambitious zeal 
and a dissemble cunning to aspire 

my father call in question for his life 
o let not i a sad spectator be 
of such a dismal object 

nor will I 
but leave they to their hate cruelty 

this be no place for lady we allow 
her absence of the rest let none depart 
till we have search the cunning of his heart 

a bar a judgement seat and jury set 
yet can all this daunt our innocence 

you have disloyal seek to exceed 
the king your sovereign and his royal deed 
to blemish which your fellow peer thus construe 
that strengthen by the alliance of the king 
and better arm by the people love 
you may prove dangerous 
in policy of state to quench the spark 
before they grow to flame and top your height 
before your spacious branch spread too far 
what to this general motion can you say 
before we tax you with particular 

with reverence to the state before which I stand 
that you my lord of Chester appear shallow 
to think my action can disgrace the king 
as if the luster of a petty star 
shall with the moon compare alas my deed 
confer with he be like a candle light 
to outshine the midday glory can the king 
the glorious mirror of all gratitude 
condemn that virtue in another bosom 
which in his own shine so transparent 
o pardon i mere virtue be my end 
who pitch the king do many time transcend 

to tax you more succinct you have first 
abuse the king in send to the court 
your daughter less fair and the least belove 

and that include contempt most barbarous 
which you in that unsubjectlike express 
your former emulation we omit 
as thing that may find tolerable excuse 
and be indeed not matter capital 
but to the best and great when the king 
out of his bounty and magnificence 
vouchsafe to style thou with the name of son 
be but a subject with contort brow 
and look of scorn you take his courtesy 
and in contempt send back the princess dower 

most true a ground proposition 
to question you of life 

my life my lord 
it please i that the king in person deign 
to grace my cause with his majestic ear 
you plead for i in this and speak my excuse 
I have but two in all 
he send for one and he receive they both 
with they a sweet and lovely prince to boot 
whoever lose I be sure the king have win 
at once a wife a daughter and a son 

it be true my lord we all can witness it 

he that my discontent object to i 
with the fair princess speak uncertain 
the man judicious such for fool allow 
as have their inward heart draw in their brow 
be there in all that bench a man so honest 
that can in this be discontent with i 
I charge you all those favour I receive 
from his high majesty I swallow not 
with greedy appetite perhaps like you 
when I be grace it come with awe and fear 
lest I offend that prince that hold i dear 
that for my brow 

but for your scornful send 
of the fair princess dower back to the king 
how can you answer that 

why Chester thus 
I be a man though subject if the mean 
lord over his wife why shall that privilege 
be only bar i shall I wive a empress 
and take her dowerless shall we love or hate 
in that my bounty equal her estate 
witness that judge above you I esteem 
the princess dear and yet marry she 
but as my wife for which I be infinite 
bind to the king why shall I grow engage 
above my power since this my lord you know 
the less we run in debt the less we owe 
give i my thought and score you on I pray 
I wish no more than I have mean to pay 

shall we my lord his action censure free 

and sentence they 

a persian history 
I read of late how the great sophy once 
fly a noble falcon at the Herne 
in come by chance a eagle souse by 
which when the hawk espy leave her first game 
and bold venture on the king of bird 
long tug they in the air till at the length 
the falcon better breathe seize on the eagle 
and strike it dead the baron praise the bird 
and for her courage she be peerless hold 
the emperor after some deliberate thought 
make he no less he cause a crown of gold 
to be new frame and fit to her head 
in honour of her courage then the bird 
with great applause be to the marketplace 
in tri triumph bear where when her utmost worth 
have be proclaim the common executioner 
first by the king command take off her crown 
and after with a sword strike off her head 
as one no better than a noble traitor 
unto the king of bird 

this use we make 
from this your ancient persian history 
that you a noble and a courteous peer 
praise for your hospital virtue and high bounty 
shall be first crown with laurel to your worth 
but since you dare against your sovereign 
oppose yourself you by your pride mislead 
shall as a noble traitor lose your head 

that sentence we confirm and it shall stand 
irrevocable by our straight command 

I be glad my liege I have a life yet leave 
in which to show my bounty even in that 
I will be liberal and spend it for you 
take it it be the last jewel that I have 
in lieu of which o grant i but a grave 

a laurel wreath a scaffold and a block 
ourself will see the execution do 
only thy life be we thy good be free 

my lord you be the life of courtesy 
and you be kind unto i above measure 
to give away what may enrich yourself 
since they be i I will bestow they thus 
the best of those that be so late but you 
my jewel ay by will restore you back 
you shall receive they separate from the rest 
to you the king son and by marriage my 
on you I will bestow my armoury 
stable of horse and weapon for the war 
I know you love a soldier to the princess 
and my two daughter I give equal portion 
from my revenue but if my fair wife 
prove and produce a malechild he I make 
my universal heir but if a female 
her dower be with the rest proportionable 
the next I give it be my soul to heaven 
where my creator reign my word thus end 
body to earth my soul to heaven ascend 

stay 

hold 

executioner forbear 

hear i a daughter for a father plead 

o father hear i for my husband life 
double ally I be his niece and wife 

o father hear i for a father crave 

than sentence he o let i perish rather 
I plead for he that be both my son and father 

o make your mercy to this prisoner free 

father to we 

and husband unto i 

hence with these womanish clamour 

unto these 
let i my liege presume to add another 
behold he kneel that be your son and brother 

your sister and your daughter great king hear 

your mother and your daughter 

or like dear 
your queen and sister 

speak what have he do 

whoever see a father on a son 
give sentence or my royal lord which rather 
add to your guilt a son condemn the father 

my liege command they hence they but disturb 
the traitor in his death 

a traitor be he 
that dare so term he Chester we mean thou 
our best of subject with our height of grace 
we wed thou to we in this strict embrace 
thy virtue bounty envy courtesy 
thy courage and thy constancy in death 
thy love and loyalty to the end continue 
more than their clamorous importunity 
prevail with we then as our best and great 
not to exceed but equal thou in love 
to end between we this heroic strife 
accept what we most precious hold thy life 

which as your gift I will keep till heaven and nature 
confine it hence and always it expose 
unto your love and service I never love it 
but since it be you and by your gift now i 

I observe in thou 
the substance of all perfect loyalty 
in you save flattery envy hate and pride 
nothing or ought to goodness that be ally 
resign those place that belong to he 
better than so bear noble be unborn 
till you your heart can fashion to your face 
we here suspend you from your style and place 

a royal doom

thy beauteous bride as we will hand our queen

of most choice taste press from the pure grape

in our two virtue after time shall sing 
a loyal subject and a royal king
