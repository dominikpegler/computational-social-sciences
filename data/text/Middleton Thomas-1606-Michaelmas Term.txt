why thou be a unreasonable fellow i'faith do not all trade live by their ware and yet call honest liver do they not thrive best when they utter most and make it away by the great be not wholesale the chief merchandise do you think some merchant can keep their wife so brave but for their wholesale you be foul deceive and you think so 

you be so glue to punishment and shame your word even deserve whip to bear the habit of a gentlewoman and be in mind so distant 

why you fool you be not gentlewoman sinner and there be no courageous sinner among we but be a gentlewoman by the mother side I warrant you beside we be not always bind to think those our father that marry our mother but those that lie with our mother and they may be gentleman bear and bear again for aught we know you know
