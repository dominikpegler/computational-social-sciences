nature descend from far above the sphere 
to frolic here in fair Utopia 
where my chief work do flourish in their prime 
and wanton in their first simplicity 
here I survey the picture firmament 
with hurtless flame in concave of the moon 
the liquid substance of the welkin waste 
where moisture treasury be cloud up 
the mutual jointure of all swell sea 
and all the creature which their wave contain 
last the rundle of this massive earth 
from utmost face unto the centre point 
all these and all their endless circumstance 
here I survey and glory in myself 
but what mean discord so to knit the brow 
with sorrow cloud eclipse our delight 

it grieve my heart that still in every work 
my fellow concord frustrate my desire 
when I to perfect up some wondrous deed 
do bring forth good and bad or light and dark 
pleasant and sad move and fix thing 
frail and immortal or like contrary 
she with her hand unite they all in one 
and so make void the end of my attempt 

I tell thou discord while you twain attend 
on nature train your work must prove but one 
and in yourselves though you be different 
yet in my service must you well agree 
for nature work her will from contrary 
but see where our utopian shepherd come 

thou sovereign queen and author of the world 
of all that be or be or shall be frame 
to finish up the heap of thy great gift 
vouchsafe thy simple servant one request 

stand up and tell the sum of your desire 
the boon be great that nature will not grant 
it ever be and shall be still my joy 
with wholesome gift to bless my workmanship 

we crave fair goddess at thy heavenly hand 
to have as every other creature have 
a sure and certain mean among ourselves 
to propagate the issue of our kind 
as it be comfort to our sole estate 
so be it ease unto thy work hand 
each fish that swim in the float sea 
each wing fowl that soar in the air 
and every beast that feed on the ground 
have mate of pleasure to uphold their brood 
but thy utopian poor and simple man 
as yet bewail their want of female sex 

a female shall you have my lovely swain 
like to yourselves but of a pure mould 
meanwhile go hence and tend your tender flock 
and when I send she see you hold she dear exeunt shepherd sing a roundelay in praise of nature 
now virgin put your hand to holy work 
that we may frame new wonder to the world they draw the curtain from before nature shop where stand a image clad and some unclothe they bring forth the clothe image 
when I array this lifeless image thus 
it be decree in my deep providence 
to make it such as our utopian crave 
a mirror of the earth and heaven despite 
the matter first when it be void of form 
be pure water earth and air and fire 
and when I shape it in a matchless mould 
whereof the like be never see before 
it grow to this impression that you see 
and want nothing now but life and soul 
but life and soul I shall inspire from heaven 
so hold it fast till with my quicken breath 
I kindle inward seed of sense and mind 
now fire be turn to choler air to blood 
water to humour pure than itself 
and earth to flesh more clear than crystal rock 
and discord stand aloof that concord hand 
may join the spirit with the flesh in league Concord fast embrace the image 

now do I feel how life and inward sense 
impart motion unto every limb 

then let she stand or move or walk alone the image walk about fearful 
herein have nature go beyond herself 
and heaven will grudge at beauty of the earth 
when it espy a second son below 

now every part perform her function due 
except the tongue who string be yet untie 

discord unlose her tongue to serve her turn 
for in distress that must be her defence 
and from that root will many mischief grow 
if once she spot her state of innocence image speak Pandora kneel 
Haile heavenly queen the author of all good 
who will have wrought in i the fruit of life 
and fill i with a understanding soul 
to know the difference betwixt good and bad nature lift she up 
I make thou for a solace unto man 
and see thou follow our command will 
now be thou nature glory and delight 
compact of every heavenly excellence 
thou be endow with Saturn deep conceit 
thy mind as haught as Jupiter high thought 
thy stomach lionlike like mavors heart 
thy eye bright beam like sol in his array 
thy cheek more fair then be fair Venus cheek 
thy tongue more eloquent than Mercury 
thy forehead white than the silver moon 
thus have I rob the planet for thy sake 
beside all this thou have proud Juno arm 
Aurora hand and lovely Thetis foot 
use all these well and nature be thy friend 
but use they ill and nature be thy foe 
now that thy name may suit thy quality 
I give to thou Pandora for thy name 

what creature have we here a new find god 
a second man less perfect than the first 

a woman this forsooth but make in haste 
to rob we planet of our ornament 

be this the saint that steal my Juno arm 

my eye then govern thou my daylight car 

my cheek then Cupid be at thy command 

my tongue thou pretty parrot speak a while 

my forehead then fair Cynthia shine by night 

what foul contempt be this you planet use 
against the glory of my word and work 
it be my will and that shall stand for law 
and she be frame to darken all your pride 
ordain not I your motion and yourselves 
and dare you check the author of your life 
be not your light contrive in nature shop 
but I have mean to end what I begin 
and make death triumph in your life decay 
if thus you cross the meed of my desert 
be sure I will dissolve your harmony 
when once you touch the fix period 
meanwhile I leave my worthy workmanship 
here to obscure the pride of your disdain Exit 

then in revenge of nature and her work 
let we conclude to show our empery 
and bend our force against this earthly star 
each one in course shall signorize awhile 
that she may feel the influence of her beam 
and rue that she be form in our despite 
my turn be first and Saturn will begin he ascend 

and I will begin where Saturn make a end 
and when I end then mar shall tyrannize 
and after mar then sol shall marshal she 
and after sol each other in his course 
come let we go that Saturn may begin 

I shall instill such melancholy mood 
as by corrupt of her pure blood 
shall first with sullen sorrow cloud her brain 
and then surround her heart with froward care 
she shall be sick with passion of the heart 
selfwilled and tonguetied but full fraught with tear enter Gunophilus 
gracious Pandora nature thy good friend 
have send Gunophilus to wait on thou 
for honour due that appertain her will 
and for the grace of thy lovely self 
Gunophilus will serve in humble sort 
and be resolve to live and die with thou 

if nature wild then do attend on i 
but little service have I to command 
if I myself may choose my kind of life 
nor thou nor any else shall stay with i 
I find myself unfit for company 

how so fair mistress in your flower youth 
when pleasure joy shall sit in every thought 

avaunt sir sauce play you the questioner 
what be that to thou if I be sick or sad 
either demean thyself in better sort 
or get thou hence and serve some other where 

a sour beginning but no remedy 
nature have bind i and I must obey 
I see that servant must have merchant ear 
to bear the blast and brunt of every wind 

what throb be these that labour in my breast 
what swell cloud that overcast my brain 
I burst unless by tear they turn to rain 
I grudge and grieve but know not well whereat 
and rather choose to weep then speak my mind 
for fretful sorrow captivate my tongue she play the vixen with every thing about she 

see where she sit in who we must delight 
beware she sleep no noise for wake she 

asleep why see how her allure eye 
with open look do glance on every side 

o eye more fair than be the morning star 

nature herself be not so lovely fair 

let we with reverence kiss her lily hand they all kneel to she 
and by desert in service win her love 
sweet dame if Stesias may content thy eye 
command my neat my flock and tender kid 
whereof great store do overspread our plain 
grant i sweet mistress but to kiss thy hand she hit he on the lip 

no Stesias no Learchus be the man 
thou mirror of dame nature cunning work 
let i but hold thou by that sacred hand 
and I shall make thou our utopian queen 
and set a guild chaplet on thy head 
that nymph and satyr may admire thy pomp she strike his hand he rise 

these twain and I have fortune all alike 

sweet nature pride let i but see thy hand 
and servant like shall Melos wait on thou 
and bear thy train as in the glorious heaven 
Perseus support his love Andromeda 
who thirty star whether they rise or fall 
he fall or rise hang at her heel she thrust her hand in her pocket 

o then to bless the love of Iphicles 
who heart do hold thou dear than himself 
do but behold i with a love look 
and I will lead thou in our solemn dance 
teach thou tune and pleasant lay of love she wink and frown 

no kiss nor touch nor friendly look 
what churlish influence deprive her mind 
for nature say that she be innocent 
and full fraught with virtuous quality 
but speak sweet love thou can not speak but well 

she be not tongue tie that I know by proof 

speak once Pandora to thy love friend 

rude knave what mean you thus to trouble i 

she speak to you my master I be none of your company 

Alas she weep sound Gunophilus 
oh help to rear thy mistress from the ground 

this be the very passion of the heart 
and melancholy be the ground thereof 

o then to sift that humour from her heart 
let we with roundelay delight her ear 
for I have hear that music be a mean 
to calm the rage of melancholy mood they sing she start up and run away at the end of the song say 

what song what pipe and fiddle have we here 
Will you not suffer i to take my rest Exit 

what shall we do to vanquish her disease 
the death of that be life to our desire 
but let we go we must not leave she thus exeunt Saturn descend on the stage 
Saturn have lay foundation to the rest 
whereon to build the ruin of this dame 
and spot her innocence with vicious thought 
my turn be past and jupiter be next Exit 

though rancour now be root from my heart 
I feel it burden in another sort 
by day I think of nothing but of rule 
by night my dream be all of empery 
my ear delight to hear of sovereignty 
my tongue desire to speak of princely sway 
my eye will every object be a crown 

Danae be fair and Leda please i well 
lovely Calisco set my heart on fire 
and in my eye Europa be a gem 
but in the beauty of this paragon 
dame nature far have go beyond herself 
and in this one be all my love contain 
and come what can come jupiter shall prove 
if fair Pandora will accept his love 
but first I must discuss this heavenly cloud 
that hide i from the sight of mortal eye 
behold Pandora where thy lover sit 
high jove himself who ravish with thy blaze 
receive more influence than he power on thou 
and humble sue for succour at thy hand 

why what be thou more than utopian swain 

the king of god one of immortal race 
and he that with a beck control the heaven 

why then Pandora do exceed the heaven 
who neither fear nor love jupiter 

thy beauty will excuse whatever thou say 
and in thy look thy word be privilege 
but if Pandora do conceive those gift 
that jove can give she will esteem his love 
for I can make thou empress of the world 
and seat thou in the glorious firmament 

the word of empress and of firmament 
more please my ear than jupiter my eye 
yet if thy love be like to thy protest 
give i thy golden sceptre in my hand 
but not as purchase of my precious love 
for that be more than heaven itself be worth 

there hold the sceptre of eternal jove 
but let not majesty increase thy pride 

what lack I now but a imperial throne 
and Ariadne starlight diadem 

false perjure jupiter and full of guile 
be these the fruit of thy new government 
be Juno beauty and thy wedlock vow 
and all my kindness tread under foot 
be it not enough to fancy such a trull 
but thou must yield thy scepter to her hand 
I think that Ganymede have wean thy heart 
from lawless lust of any woman love 
but well I see that every time thou stray 
thy lust but look for strumpet star below 

why know Pandora scorn both jove and thou 
and there she lay his sceptre on the ground 

this shall with i to our celestial court 
where god fond jupiter shall see thy shame 
and laugh at love for taint majesty 
and when you please you will repair to we 
but as for thou thou shameless counterfeit 
thy pride shall quick lose her paint plume 
and feel the heavy weight of Juno wrath Exit Juno 

let Juno fret and move the power of heaven 
yet in herself Pandora stand secure 
be I not nature darling and her pride 
have she not spend her treasure all on i 

yet be thou wise I counsel thou for love 
and fear displeasure at a goddess hand 

I tell thou jupiter Pandora worth 
be far exceed all your goddess 
and since in she thou do obscure my praise 
here to be short I do abjure thy love 

I may not blame thou for my beam be cause 
of all this insolence and proud disdain 
but to prevent a second rage storm 
if jealous Juno shall by chance return 
here end my love Pandora now farewell Exit 

and be thou cloud up fare as thou list 
Pandora heart shall never stoop to jove 
Gunophilus base vassal as thou be 
how hap when Juno be in presence here 
thou do not honour i with kneel and crouch 
and lay thy hand under my precious foot he power down a number of courtesy 
to make she know the height of my desert 
base peasant humble watch my stately look 
and yield applause to every word I speak 
or from my service I will discard thou quite Gunophilus on his knee 

fair and dread sovereign lady of the world 
even then when jealous Juno be in place 
as I behold the glory of thy face 
my feeble eye admire majesty 
do sink into my heart such holly fear 
that very fear amaze every sense 
withhold my tongue from say what I will 
and freeze my joint from bow when they shall 

I now Gunophilus thou please i 
these word and curtsy prove thou dutiful 

now Stesias speak 

Learchus plead for love 

now cyprian queen guider of love thought help Iphicles 

Melos must speed or die 

whether now my master in such post haste 
her excellence be not at leisure now 

o sweet Gunophilus further our attempt 

and we shall make thou rich with our reward 

stay here until I know her further pleasure 
Stesias and his fellow humble crave access to your excellence 

I now thou fit my humour let they come 

Come on master 

tell on my dear when come that happy hour 
whereon thy love shall guerdon my desire 

how long shall sorrow winter pinch my heart 
and luke warm hope be chill with freeze fear 
before my suit obtain thy sweet consent 

how long shall death encroach by delay 
a bridge the course of my decay life 
before Pandora love poor Iphicles 

how long shall care cut off my flower prime 
before the harvest of my love be in 

o speak sweet love 

some gentle word sweet love 

o let thy tongue first salve Learchus wound 
that first be make with those immortal eye 

the only promise of thy future love 
will drown the secret heap of my despair 
in endless ocean of expect joy 

although my breast yet never harbour love 
yet shall my bounty free your servitude 
if love may well consort our majesty 
and not debase our matchless dignity 

sweet honey word but see with bitter gall 

they draw i on and yet they put i back 

they hold i up and yet they let i fall 

they give i life and yet they let i die 

but as thou will so give i sweet or sour 
for in thy pleasure must be my content 

whether thou draw i on or put i back 
I must admire thy beauty wilderness 

and as thou will so let i stand or fall 
love have decree thy word must govern i 

and as thou will so let i live or die 
in life or death I must obey thy will 

I please myself in your humility 
yet will I make some trial of your faith 
before I stoop to favour your complaint 
for wot you well Pandora know her worth 
he that will purchase thing of great prize 
must conquer by his deed and not by word 
go then all four and slay the savage boar 
which rove up and down with ceaseless rage 
destroy the fruit of our utopian field 
and he that first present i with his head 
shall wear my glove in favour of the deed 

we go Pandora 

nay we run 

we fly 

thus must Pandora exercise these swain 
command they to dangerous exploit 
and be they king my beauty shall command 
sirrah Gunophilus bear up my train Exit Pandora and Gunoph 

Mars come entreat by the queen of heaven 
to summon jove from this his regiment 
such jealous humour crow in her brain 
that she be mad till he return from hence 
now sovereign jove king of immortal king 
thy lovely Juno long have look for thou 
and till thou come think every hour a year 

and jove will go the soon to assuage 
her frantic idle and suspicious thought 
for well I know Pandora trouble she 
nor will she calm the tempest of her mind 
until with a whirlwind of outrageous word 
she beat my ear and weep curse heart away he descend 
yet will I go for word be but a blast 
and sunshine will ensue when storm be pass Exit with Ganymede 

here let we stay till fair Pandora come 
and then shall Stesias have his due reward 

and why not Iphicles as well as you 

the prize be i my sword cut off his head 

but first my spear do wound he to the death 

he fall not down till I have gore his side 

content you all Learchus do the deed 
and I will make it good who ear say nay 

Melos will die before he lose his right 

nay then it be time to snatch the head be i 

lay down or I shall lay thou on the earth 

ay so fair and far off for fear of hurt 
see how the coward counterfeit a fray 
strike home you dastard swain strike home I say 
fight you in jest let i bestir i then 
and see if I can cudgel you all four she snatch the spear out of Stesias hand and lay about she 

what be my mistress mankind on the sudden 

alas why strike Pandora her best friend 

my friend base peasant 
my friend will fight like man 
avaunt or I shall lay you all for dead exeunt all save Stesias 

see cruel fair how thou have wrong thy friend he show his shirt all bloody 
to spill his blood that keep it but for thou 
there be my desert and here be my reward point first to the head on the ground and then to his wound 
I dare not say of a ingrateful mind 
but if Pandora have be well advise 
this dare I say that Stesias have be spare 

begin I say before I strike again 

o stay sweet mistress and be satisfy 

base vassal how dare thou presume to speak 
will thou encounter any deed of i she beat he 
how long have you be make a counsellor 

here strike thy fill make lavish of my life 
that in my death my love may find relief 
lance up my side that when my heart leap out 
thou may behold how it be scorch with love 
and every way crosswound with desire 
there shall thou read my passion deep engrave 
and in the midst only Pandora name 

what tell thou i of love and fancy fire 
fire of debate be kindle in my heart 
and be it not that thou be all unarm 
be sure I shall make trial of thy strength 
but now the death of some fierce savage beast 
in blood shall end my fury tragedy 
for fight I must or else my gall will burst Exit Pand 

ah ruthless heart hard than adamant 
who ear be deaf against affection plaint 
and eye be blind when sorrow shed her tear 
neither content that I live nor die 
but fondling as I be why grieve I thus 
be not Pandora mistress of my life 
yes yes and every act of she be just 
her hard word be but a gentle wind 
her great wound be but a please harm 
death at her hand be but a second life Exit Stesi Mars descend 
Mars have enforce Pandora against her kind 
to manage arm and quarrel with her friend 
and thus I leave she all incense with ire 
let sol cool that which I have set on fire Exit 

in look down upon this base world 
I long have see and rude Pandora harm 
but as myself by nature be incline 
so shall she now become gentle and kind 
abandon all rancour pride and rage 
and change from a lion to a lamb 
she shall be love liberal and chaste 
discreet and patient merciful and mild 
inspire with poetry and prophesy 
and virtue appertain womanhood 

tell i Gunophilus how do Stesias now 
how fare he with his wound unhappy i 
that so unkind hurt so kind a friend 
but Stesias if thou pardon what be past 
I shall reward thy sufferance with love 
these eye that be like two malignant star 
shall yield their comfort with their sweet aspect 
and these my lip that do blaspheme thy love 
shall speak thou fair and bless thou with a kiss 
and this my hand that hurt thy tender side 
shall first with herb recure the wound it make 
then plight my faith to thou in recompense 
and thou Gunophilus I pray thou pardon i 
that I misdo thou in my witless rage 
as time shall yield occasion be thou sure 
I will not fail to make thou some amends 

I so content i in this pleasant calm 
that former storm be utter forget 

we follow still in hope of grace to come 

o sweet Pandora deign our humble suit 

o grant i love or wound i to the death 

stand up Pandora be no long proud 
but shame at folly of her former deed 
but why stand Stesias like a man dismay 
draw near I say and thou with all the rest 
forgive the rigour of Pandora hand 
and quite forget the fault of my disdain 
now be the time if you consent all four 
wherein I will make amends for old offence 
one of you four shall be my wedlock mate 
and all the rest my wellbeloved friend 
but vow you here in presence of the god 
that when I choose my choice shall please you all 

then make I vow by Pallas shepherd queen 
that Stesias will allow Pandora choice 
but if he speed that less deserve than I 
I will rather die than grudge or make complaint 

I swear the like by all our country god 

and I by our Diana holy head 

and I by Ceres and her sacred nymph 

then love and Hymen bless i in my choice 
you all be young and all be lovely fair 
all kind and courteous and of sweet demean 
all right and valiant all in flower prime 
but since you grant my will his liberty 
come Stesias take Pandora by the hand 
and with my hand I plight my spotless faith 

the word have almost slay i with delight 

the word with sorrow kill i outright 

o happy Stesias but unhappy i 

Come let we go and weep our want else where 
Stesias have get Pandora from we all exeunt 

their sad depart will make my heart to earn 
be not the joy that I conceive in thou 
go go Gunophilus without delay 
gather i balm and cool violet 
and of our holly herb nicotian 
and bring with all pure honey from the hive 
that I may here compound a wholesome salve 
to heal the wound of my unhappy hand 

I go 

bless be the hand that make so happy wound 
for in my sufferance have I win thy love 
and bless thou that have try my faith 
have give admittance to my heart desert 
now all be well and all my hurt be whole 
and I in paradise of my delight 
Come lovely spouse let we go walk the wood 
where warble bird record our happiness 
and whistle leaf make music to our mirth 
and Flora strew her bower to welcome thou 

but first sweet husband be thou rule by i 
go make provision for some holy rite 
that zeal may prosper our new join love 
and by and by myself will follow thou 

stay not my decree for in thy look I live 

I feel myself inspire but wot not how 
nor what it be unless some holy power 
my heart foretell i many thing to come 
and I be full of unacquainted skill 
yet such as will not issue from my tongue 
but like Sibylla golden prophecy 
affect rather to be clad in verse 
the certain badge of great Apollo gift 
then to be spread and soil in vulgar word 
and now to ease the burden of my bulk 
like Sibyl thus Pandora must begin 
Come my Pandora Stesias stay for thou 

peace man with reverence here and note my word 
for from Pandora speak the laureate God 
utopiae Stesias phoenici soluit amorem 
numina caelorum dum pia praecipiunt 
and backward thus the same but double sense 
praecipiunt pia dum celorum numina amorem 
soluit phoenici Stesias utopiae 
he sober repeat these verse first forward and then backward say 

if soluere amorem signify to love 
then mean this prophesy good to Stesias 
but if it signify to withdraw love 
then be it ill abodement to we both 
but speak Pandora while the God inspire 

Idaliis prio hic pveris est aequoris altò 
pulchrior hec nymphis & prio aoniis 
and backward thus but still all one in sense 
aoniis prio & nymphis hec pulchrior alti 
aequoris est pveris hic prio Idaliis 
he sober repeat these also backward and forward say 

forward and back these also be alike 
and sense all one the point only change 
they but import Pandora praise and i 

Even now begin my fury to retire 
and now with Stesias hence will I retire exeunt 

bright cyprian queen entreat Pandora fair 
for though at first Phoebus envy her look 
yet now do he admire her glorious hue 
And swear that neither Daphne in the spring 
nor glister Thetis in her orient robe 
nor shamefast morning gird in silver cloud 
be half so lovely as this earthly saint 

And be so fair my beam shall make her light 
for lenity be beauty wait maid 

make chastity Pandora wait maid 
for modest thought beseem a woman best 

away with chastity and modest thought 
quo mihi fortuna si non conceditur uti 
be she not young then let she to the world 
all those be strumpet that be over chaste 
defy such as keep their company 
it be not the touch of a woman hand 
kiss her lip hang about her neck 
a speak look no nor a yield word 
that man expect believe i sol it be more 
and be Mars here he will protest as much 

but what be more than this be worse than nought 
I dare not stay lest she infect i too Exit 

what be he go then light foot joculus 
set i Pandora in a dance vain 

fair mother I will make Pandora blithe 
and like a satire hop upon these plain Exit 

go Cupid give her all the golden shaft 
and she will take thou for a forester 

I will and you shall see she straight in love 

here Venus sit and with thy influence 
govern Pandora nature miracle 

prithee be quiet wherefore shall I dance 

thus dance the satyr on the even lawn 

thus pretty satyr will Pandora dance 

and thus will Cupid make her melody 

be I a man I can love thou 

I be a maiden will thou have i 

but Stesias say you be not 

what then I care not 

nor I 

nor I 

then mere farewell my maiden head 
these be all the tear I will shed 
turn about and trip it 
Venus Cupid and joculus come leave she now 

the boy be go and I will follow they 
I will not follow they they be too young 
what honey thought be in Pandora brain 
hospitis est tepedo nocte recepta svi 
ah I envy she why be not I so 
and so will I be where be Iphicles 
Melos Learchus any of the three 
I cure the sick I study poetry 
I think of honour and of chastity 
no love be fit than Pandora thought 
yet not the love of Stesias alone 
Learchus be as fair as Stesias 
and Melos lovely than Learchus far 
but may I choose I will have Iphicles 
and of they all Stesias deserve the least 
must I be tie to he no I will be loose 
as loose as Helen for I be as fair 

pretty Gunophilus give i the herb 
where do thou gather they my lovely boy 

upon Learchus plain 

I fear i Cupid dance upon the plain 
I see his arrow head upon the leaf 

and I his golden quiver and his bow 

thou do dissemble but I mean good sooth 
these herb have wrought some wondrous effect 
have they this virtue from thy lily hand 
let we see thy hand my fair Gunophilus 

it may be they have for I have not wash they this many a day 

such slender finger have jove Ganymede 
Gunophilus I be love sick for thou 

o that I be worthy you shall be sick for i 

I languish for thou therefore be my love 

better you languish then I be beat 
pardon i I dare not love because of my master 

I will hide thou in a wood and keep thou close 

but what if he come a hunt that way 

I will say thou be a satire of the wood 

then I must have horn 

I so thou shall I will give thou Stesias horn 

why he have none 

but he may have short 

you say true and of that condition I be you

but why bring thou i this letter 

only to certify you that she be in health

and thus be loath to trouble you I commit you to God

the wicked youngling flout we let he go 

immortal pan where ere this lad remain 
revenge the wrong that he have do thy swain 

o that a creature so divine as she 
who beauty may enforce the heaven to blush 
and make fair nature angry at the heart 
that she have make she to obscure herself 
shall be so fickle and so full of slight 
and feign love to all love none at all 

have she be constant unto Iphicles 
I will have clad she in sweet Flora robe 
have set Diana garland on her head 
make her sole mistress of my wanton flock 
and sing in honour of her deity 
where now with tear I curse Pandora name 

the spring that smile to see Pandora face 
and leap above the bank to touch her lip 
the proud plain dance with Pandora weight 
the jocund tree that vald when she come near 
and in the murmur of their whisper leaf 
do seem to say Pandora be our queen 
witness how fair and beautiful she be 
but now alone how false and treacherous 

here I abjure Pandora and protest 
to live for ever in a single life 

the like vow make Learchus to great pan 

and Iphicles though sore against his will 

in witness of my vow I rend these line 
oh thus be my love disperse into the air 

here lie the bloody napkin which she send 
and with it my affection and my love 

break break Pandora ring and with it break 
Pandora love that almost burst my heart 

ah whither run my love Pandora stay 
gentle Pandora stay run not so fast 

shall I not stamp upon the ground I will 
who say Pandora shall not rend her hair 
where be the grove that ask i how I do 
give i a angle for the fish will bite 

look how Pandora rave now she be stark mad 

for you she rave that mean to ravish she 
help to recover she or else you die 

may she with rave die do what thou dare 

she over reach we with deceitful guile 
and pan to who we pray have wrought revenge 

I will have the ocean put into a glass 
and drink it to the health of Stesias 
thy head be full of hedgehog Iphicles 
so shake they of now let i see thy hand 
look where a blaze star be in this line 
and in the other two and twenty son 

Come come Pandora sleep within my arm 

thy arm be firebrand where be Gunophilus 
go kiss the echo and bid love untruss 
go fetch the black goat with the brazen heel 
and tell the bellwether I hear he not 
not not not that you shall not come unto i 
this night not at all at all at all 

she be asleep master shall I wake she 

o no Gunophilus there let her sleep 
and let we pray that she may be recure 

Stesias thou pity she that love thou not 

the word we tell thou Stesias be too true 

never do Iphicles dissemble yet 
believe i Stesias she have be untrue 

yet will you slay i with your slanderous word 
do you not all swear for her chastity 

it be her subtle wit that make we swear 
for Stesias know she show love to we all 
and several send for we by this swain 
and unto i he bring such honey line 
as overcome I fly unto her bower 
who when I come swear she loud i alone 
will i to deny the word I speak 
and she at night will meet i in the grove 
thus mean simple lo I be betray 

Gunophilus bring i a bloody cloth 
say for my love she be almost slay 
and when I come she use i as this swain 
protest love and point i this place 

and by this bearer I receive a ring 
and many a love word that draw i forth 
oh that a woman shall dissemble so 
she then for swear Learchus and this swain 
say that Iphicles be only she 
whereat I promise to deny my word 
and she to meet i at Enepius bank 

be thou the messenger unto they all 

I be and all that they have say be true 
she love not you not they but i alone 
how oft have she run up and down the lawn 
call aloud where be Gunophilus 

ah how my heart swell at these miscreant word 

Come let we leave he in this pensive mood 

fret Stesias fret while we dance on the plain 

such fortune happen to incredulus swain 

sweet be a single life Stesias farewell 

go life fly soul go wretched Stesias 
curse be Utopia for Pandora sake 
let wild boar with their tusk blow up my lawn 
devour wolf come shake my tender lamb 
drive up my goat unto some steepy rock 
and let they fall down headlong in the sea 
she shall not live nor thou Gunophilus 
to triumph in poor Stesias overthrow 

stay shepherd stay 

hurt not Pandora lovely Stesias 

what mean my love to look so pale and wan 

for thou base strumpet be I pale and win 

speak mild or I will make thou crabbed swain 

take she again and love she Stesias 

not for Utopia no not for the world 

ah can thou frown on she that look so sweet 

have I offend thou I will make amends 

and what can thou demand more at her hand 

to slay herself that I may live alone 

Flint heart shepherd thou deserve she not 

if thou be jove convey she from the earth 
and punish this Gunophilus she man 

o jove let this be my punishment to live still with Pandora 

envious planet you have do your worst 
yet in despite of you Pandora live 
and see the shepherd have abjure her love 
she shall be place in one of your seven orb 
but thou that have not serve she as I wild 
vanish into a hawthorn as thou stand 
near shall thou wait upon Pandora more 

o nature place Pandora in my sphere 
for I be old and she will make i young 

with i and I will leave the queen of heaven 

with i and Venus shall no more be i 

with i and I will forget fair Daphne love 

with i and I will turn Cupid out of door 

with i and I will forsake Aglauros love 

no fair Pandora stay with Cynthia 
and I will love thou more than all the rest 
rule thou my star while I stay in the wood 
or keep with Pluto in the infernal shade 

go where thou will so I be rid of thou 

speak my Pandora where will thou be 

not with old Saturn for he look like death 
nor yet with jupiter lest Juno storm 
nor with thou Mars for Venus be thy love 
nor with thou Sol thou have two paramour 
the sea bear Thetis and the ruddy morn 
nor with thou Venus lest I be in love 
with blindfold Cupid or young joculus 
nor with thou Hermes thou be full of slight 
and when I need thou jove will send thou forth 
say Cynthia shall Pandora rule thy star 
and will thou play Diana in the wood 
or Hecate in Pluto regiment 

i Pandora 

fair nature let thy hand maid dwell with she 
for know that change be my felicity 
and fickleness Pandora proper form 
thou make i sullen first and thou jove proud 
thou bloody mind he a Puritan 
thou Venus make i love all that I see 
and Hermes to deceive all that I love 
but Cynthia make i idle mutable forgetful 
foolish fickle frantic mad 
these be the humour that content i best 
and therefore will I stay with Cynthia 

and Stesias since thou set so light on she 
be thou her slave and follow she in the moon 

I will rather die than bear her company 

nature will have it so attend on she 

I will have thou be her vassal murmur not 

then to revenge i of Gunophilus 
I will rend this hawthorn with my furious hand 
and bear this bush if ear she look but back 
I will scratch her face that be so false to i 

now rule Pandora in fair Cynthia steed 
and make the moon inconstant like thyself 
reign thou at woman nuptial and their birth 
let they be mutable in all their love 
fantastical childish and foolish in their desire 
demand toy and stark mad 
when they can have their will 
now follow i ye wander light of heaven 
and grieve not that she be not place with you 
all you shall glance at she in your aspect 
and in conjunction dwell with she a space 

o that they have my room 

I charge thou follow she but hurt she not
