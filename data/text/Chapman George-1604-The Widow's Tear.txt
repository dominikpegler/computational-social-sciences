I be therein most confident 

Indeed you have better believe it then try it but pray sister tell i you be a woman do not you wife nod your head and smile one upon another when you meet abroad

as who shall say be not we mad wench that can lead our blind husband thus by the nose do you not brag among yourselves how gross you abuse their honest credulity how they adore you for saint and you believe it while you adorn their temple and they believe it not how you vow widowhood in their life time and they believe you when even in the sight of their breathless corpse ere they be full cold you join embrace with his groom or his physician and perhaps his poisoner or at least by the next moon if you can expect so long solemn plight new hymeneal bond with a wild confident untamed ruffian 

as for example 

and make he the top of his house and sovereign lord of the palace as for example look you brother this glass be i 

what of that 

while I be with it it take impression from my face but can I make it so i that it shall be of no use to any other will it not do his office to you or you and as well to my groom as to myself brother monopoly be cry down be it not madness for i to believe when I have conquer that fort of chastity the great countess that if another man of my make and mettle shall assault she her eye and ear shall lose their function her other part their use as if nature have make she all in vain unless I only have stumble into her quarter 

brother I fear i in your travail you have drink too much of that italian air that have infect the whole mass of your ingenuous nature dry up in you all sap of generous disposition poison the very essence of your soul and so pollute your sense that whatsoever enter there take from they contagion and be to your fancy represent as foul and taint which in itself perhaps be spotless 

no sister it have refine my sense and make i see with clear eye and to judge of object as they true be not as they seem and through their mask to discern the true face of thing it tell i how short live widow tear be that their weep be in truth but laugh under a mask that they mourn in their gown and laugh in their sleeve all which I believe as a delphian oracle and be resolve to burn in that faith and in that resolution do I march to the great lady 

you lose time brother in discourse by this have you bear up with the lady and clap she aboard for I know your confidence will not dwell long in the service 

no I will perform it in the conqueror style your way be not to win Penelope by suit but by surprise the castle be carry by a sudden assault that will perhaps sit out a twelvemonth siege it will be a good breed to my young nephew here if he can procure a stand at the palace to see with what alacrity I will accost her countessship in what garb I will woo she with what facility I will win she 

it shall go hard but we will hear your entertainment for your confidence sake 

and have win her nephew this sweet face 
which all the city say be so like i 
like i shall be prefer for I will wed thou 
to my great widow daughter and sole heir

to second my attempt for this great lady 
who page I late be that she who board 
I may not sit at I may board abed 
and under bring who bear so high her head Exit 

it be miraculous that you tell i sir he come to woo our lady mistress for his wife 

it be a frenzy he be possess with and will not be cure but by some violent remedy and you shall favour i so much to make i a spectator of the scene but be she say you already accessible for suitor I think she will have stand so stiff on her widow vow that she will not endure the sight of a suitor 

faith sir Penelope can not bar her gate against her wooer but she will still be mistress of herself it be as you know a certain itch in female blood they love to be sue to but she will hearken to no suitor 

but by your leave Lycus Penelope be not so wise as her husband Ulysses for he fear the jaw of the Siren stop his ear with wax against her voice they that fear the adder sting will not come near she hiss be any suitor with she now 

a spartan lord date himself our great viceroy kinsman and two or three other of his country lord as spot in his train he come arm with his altitude letter in grace of his person with promise to make she a duchess if she embrace the match this be no mean attraction to her high thought but yet she disdain he 

and how then shall my brother presume of acceptance yet I hold it much more under her contentment to marry such a nasty braggart then under her honour to wed my brother a gentleman though I say it more honourable descend than that lord who perhaps for all his ancestry will be much trouble to name you the place where his father be bear 

nay I hold no comparison betwixt your brother and he and the venerean disease to which they say he have be long wed shall I hope first rot he ere she endure the savour of his sulphurous breath well her ladyship be at hand you be best take you to your stand

perhaps I shall 

tush herself know not what she shall do when she be transform into a widow you be now a sober and stay gentleman but if Diana for your curiosity shall translate you into a monkey do you know what gambol you shall play your only way to be resolve be to die and make trial of she

her spotless love and loyalty perhaps 
oft have hear you hold her faith so sacred 
as you be dead no man may stir a spark 
of virtuous love in way of second bond 
as if you at your death shall carry with you

and as you know soak into the bone but to say truth these angry heat that break out at the lip of these straight lace lady be but as symptom of a lustful fever that boil within they for wherefore rage wife at their husband so when they fly out for zeal against the sin 

no but because they do not purge that sin

what news Lycus where be the lady 

retire into her orchard 

a pregnant badge of love she be melancholy 

it be with the sight of her spartan wooer but howsoever it be with she you have practise strange upon your brother 

why so 

you have almost lift his wit off the hinge that spark jealousy fall into his dry melancholy brain have well near set the whole house on fire 

no matter let it work I do but pay he in his own coin 'sfoot he ply i with such a volley of unseasoned scoff as will have make patience itself turn ruffian attire itself in wound and blood but be his humour better qualify then 

yes but with a medicine ten part more dangerous than the sickness how know you strange his dotage ever be on his wife take special glory to have her love and loyalty to he so renown abroad to who she oftentimes have vow constancy after life till her own death have bring forsooth her widowtroth to bed this he joy in strange and be therein of infallible belief till your surmise begin to shake it which have lose it so as now there be nought can settle it but a trial which he be resolve upon 

as how man as how 

he be resolve to follow your advice to die and make trial of her stableness and you must lend your hand to it 

what to cut his throat 

to forge a rumour of his death to uphold it by circumstance maintain a public face of mourning and all thing appertain 

ay but the mean man what time what probability 

nay I think he have not lick his whelp into full shape yet but you shall short hear of it 

and when shall this strange conception see light 

forthwith there be nothing stay he but some odd business of import which he must wind up lest perhaps his absence by occasion of his intend trial be prolong above his aim 

thank for this news in faith this may perhaps prove happy to my nephew truth be I love my sister well and must acknowledge she more than ordinary virtue but she have so possess my brother heart with vow and disavow seal with oath of second nuptial as in that confidence he have invest she in all his state the ancient inheritance of our family and leave my nephew and the rest to hang upon her pure devotion so as he dead and she match as I be resolve she will with some young prodigal what must ensue but her postissue beggar and our house already sink bury quick in ruin but this trial may remove it and since it be come to this mark but the issue Lycus for all these solemn vow if I do not make she prove in the handle as weak as a wafer say I lose my time in travail this resolution then have set his wit in joint again he be quiet 

yes and talk of you again in the fair manner listen after your speed 

nay he be pass kind but I be glad of this trial for all that 

which he think to be a flight beyond your wing 

but he will change that think ere long my bird you see even now sing i good news and make hopeful sign to i 

somewhat can I say too since your messenger departure her ladyship have be something alter more pensive than before and take occasion to question of you what your addiction be of what taste your humour be of what cut you wear your wit and all this in a kind of disdainful scorn 

good calendar Lycus well I will pawn this jewel with thou my next encounter shall quite alter my brother judgement come let we in he shall commend it for a discreet and honourable attempt man judgment sway on that side fortune lean thy wish shall assist i 
man judgment sway on that side fortune lean 
thy wish shall assist i 

and my mean exeunt 

I must confess I be ignorant what it be to court a lady till now 

and I pray you what be it now 

to court she I perceive be to woo she with letter from court for so this spartan lord court discipline teach 

his lordship have procure a new packet from his altitude 

if he bring no better ware than letter in his packet I shall great doubt of his good speed 

if his lordship do but know how gracious his aspect be to my lady in this solitary humour 

well these retire walk of she be not usual and bode some alteration in her thought what may be the cause Sthenio 

nay it will trouble Argus with his hundred eye to descry the cause 

Venus keep she upright that she fall not from the state of her honour my fear be that some of these serpentine suitor will tempt she from her constant vow of widowhood if they do good night to our good day 

it be a sin to suspect she I have be witness to so many of her fearful protestation to our late lord against that course to her infinite oath imprint on his lip and seal in his heart with such imprecation to her bed if ever it shall receive a second impression to her open and often detestation of that incestuous life as she term it of widow marriage as be but a kind of lawful adultery like usury permit by the law not approve that to wed a second be no better than to cuckold the first that woman shall entertain wedlock as one body as one life beyond which there be no desire no thought no repentance from it no restitution to it so as if the conscience of her vow shall not restrain she yet the world shame to break such a constant resolution shall repress any such motion in she 

well for her vow they be go to heaven with her husband they bind not upon earth and as for woman resolution I must tell you the planet and as Ptolemy say the wind have a great stroke in they trust not my learning if her late strangeness and exorbitant solitude be not hatch some new monster 

Well apply Argus make you husband monster 

I speak of no husband but you wench have the pregnant wit to turn monster into husband as you turn husband into monster 

well Ianthe it be high time we make in to part our lady and her spartan wooer 

we shall appear to she like the two fortunate star in a tempest to save the shipwreck of her patience 

ay and to he to I believe for by this time he have spend the last dram of his news 

that be of his wit 

just good wittol 

if not that my lady be not too deep in her new dump we shall hear from his lordship what such a lord say of his wife the first night he embrace she to what gentleman such a count be behold for his five child what young lady such a old count shall marry what revel what presentment be towards and who pen the pegma and so forth and yet for all this I know her harsh suitor have tire she to the uttermost scruple of her forbearance and will do more unless we two like a pair of shears cut asunder the thread of his discourse 

well then let we in but my master wait you on your charge at your peril see that you guard she approach from any more intruder 

except young Tharsalio 

true except he indeed for a guard of man be not able to keep he out an it please your honour 

o wench that be the property of true valour to promise like pigmy and perform like a giant if he come I will be swear I will do my lady commandment upon he 

what beat he out 

if he shall Tharsalio will not take it ill at his hand for he do but his lady commandment 

well by Hercules he come not here 

by Venus but he do or else she have hear my lady prayer and send some gracious spirit in his likeness to fright away that spartan wooer that haunt she

the blood once hot shame do inflame the more 
what they before by art dissemble most

and to say truth brother what shame be due to it or what congruence do it carry that a young lady gallant vigorous full of spirit and complexion her appetite new whet with nuptial delight to be confine to the speculation of a death head or for the loss of a husband the world afford flesh enough make the noontide of her year the sunset of her pleasure

of their assault lance 
his horse at last sore hurt fall under he 
I see I can not rescue use my spur 
to fly away 

what from thy friend 

I in a good quarrel why not 

good I be answer 

a lance pursue i bring i back again 
and with these wound leave i to accompany 
die Lysander then they rifle we 
and leave we 
they go my breath not yet go begin to strive 
and revive sense I with my feeble joint 
crawl to Lysander stir he and withal 
he gasp cry Cynthia and breathe no more 

o then she howl out right 

passenger come and in a chariot bring we 
straight to a neighbour town where I forthwith 
coffin my friend in lead and so convey he 
to this sad place 

it be well and can not show but strange 

well sir this tale pronounce with terror suit with action clothe with such likely circumstance my wound in show her husband hearse in sight think what effect it wrought and if you doubt let the sad consequence of her retreat to his tomb be your woeful instructor 

for all this I will not despair of my wager these 
grieve that sound so loud prove always light 
true sorrow evermore keep out of sight 
this strain of mourning with sepulchre like a overdo actor affect gross and be indeed so far force from the life that it bewray itself to be altogether artificial 
to set open a shop of mourning it be palpable 
truth the substance hunt not after the shadow of popular 
fame her officious ostentation of sorrow condemn her sincerity when do ever woman mourn so unmeasurable but she do dissemble 

o god a passion thus bear thus apparel with tear sigh swoon and all the badge of true sorrow to be dissemble by Venus I be sorry I ever set foot in it can she if she dissemble thus dally with hunger be deaf to the bark of her appetite not have these four day relieve nature with one dram of sustenance 

for this do she look to be deify to have hymn make of she nay to she the tomb where she be to be no more repute the ancient monument of our family the Lysandri but the new erect altar of Cynthia to which all the paphian widow shall after their husband funeral offer their wet muckender for monument of the danger they have pass as seaman do their wet garment at Neptune temple after a ship wrack 

well I will apprehend you at your pleasure I for my part will say that if her faith be as constant as her love be hearty and unaffected her virtue may just challenge a deity to enshrine they 

ay there be another point too but one of those virtue be enough at once all nature be not capable of all gift if the brain of the west be in the head of the learned then may parishclerk be common counsel man and poet alderman deputy my sister may turn Niobe for love but till Niobe be turn to a marble I will not despair but she may prove a woman let the trial run on if she do not outrun it I will say poet be no prophet prognosticator be but mountebank and none tell true but woodmonger Exit 

a sweet gentleman you be I marvel what man what woman what name what action do his tongue glide over but it leave a slime upon it well I will present to Dipolis where Lysander stay and will not say but she may prove frail but this I will say if she shall chance to break her tear be true though woman truth be weak Exit 

who call whence be you 

I be a soldier of the watch and must enter 

among the dead 

do the dead speak open or I will force it open 

what violence be this what seek you here 
where nought but death and her attendant dwell 

what wretched soul be you that thus by night lurk here among the dead 

good soldier do not stir she she be weak and quick seize with swoon and passion and with much trouble shall we both recall her faint spirit 
five day thus have she waste and not once season her palate with the taste of meat her power of life be spend and what remain of her famish spirit serve not to breathe but sigh 
she have exile her eye from steep or sight and give they whole up to ceaseless tear over that ruthful hearse of her dear spouse slay by bandito noble bear Lysander 

and hope she with these heavy note and cry to call he from the dead in these five day have she but make he stir a finger or fetch one gasp of that forsake life she mourn 
Come honour mistress I admire your virtue 
but must reprove this vain excess of moan 
rouse yourself lady and look up from death

baneful to life and bootless to the dead 
this be the inn where all Deucalion race 
soon or late must take up their lodging 
no privilege can free we from this prison 
no tear no prayer can redeem from hence 
a captive soul make use of what you see 
let this affright spectacle of death 
teach you to nourish life

a friend 

o your success and my touch this sentinel tell I suppose one tale he be far enough I undertake by this time 

I blame he not the law be severe though just and can not be dispense 

why shall the law of Paphos with more rigour then other city law pursue offender that not appease with their life forfeit exact a justice of they after death and if a soldier in his watch forsooth lose one of the dead body he must die for it it seem the state need no soldier when that be make a law 

so we may chide the fire for burn we or say the bee be not good because she sting it be not the body the law respect but the soldier neglect when the watch the guard and safety of the city be leave abandon to all hazard but let he go and tell i if your news sort with i for Lycus apprehend they say about Lysander murder
