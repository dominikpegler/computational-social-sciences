for your acceptance

when she do smile upon i and her character 
in the full glory when she be name your sister 
be you not weary of a guest dear madam 
be I still welcome 

sir we be 
all honour in your presence and though not high 
to your merit yet your entertainment be 
as full of love as nature can express 
to a twin brother more I dare presume 
you shall accuse yourself if you be less 
a prince in Naples by free use of power 
than your own Florence 

madam you must be 
less fair and powerful in tongue if you 
expect I shall be still a prince and yet 
my ambition will be high and glorious 
enough to be receive your grace servant 
for who I shall account my age no travel 
to have my pilgrimage reward with 
your fair eye madam able to create 
another life and spirit in old nature 

how do Montalto like the duke 

sir Naples can study a addition 
of fame beyond what this alliance will 
deserve in future story the excess 
of what be good nay excellent in he 
will stock a barren province 

it be our happiness 

but it be not i for though I thus disguise 
my face and tongue my heart be my own friend 
and can wish my ambition supplant 
by any smooth chine prince alive my lord 

look how they flock and fawn upon his greatness 
these be his creature by his power place 
so near about the king he can hear nothing 
of his great favourite but what their flattery 
and partial tongue convey into his ear 

pity so sweet a nature as the king 
shall be abuse by parasite but I may 
in time dissolve these court mist that so long 
have hang upon it and render the king eye 
free to distinguish object if there be 
no witchcraft exercise upon his sense 

my lord you be very pleasant 

be it not 
become the discretion of a young 
courtier to observe time and method and when madam 
be you for this match 

what my lord 

you will not 
be sad at heart to sleep with such a bedfellow 
as the duke be 

how my lord 

provide 
matrimony be not far off yet without it 
there be some lady will excuse their modesty 
and meet and think their fate at all adventure 
if no worse man will make their husband of 
the honourable order of the nightcap 

when will you marry my lord 

I be young 
yet when I be ripe to grapple with a maidenhead 
the lord Montalto the great court patron 
will help i to a wife 

you be bind to his lordship 

and so I be madam if you know all 
I have many obligation to his honour 
but there be one write here who memory 
will keep my soul awake 

Andrugio 

I do not like their conference 

alas he have no employment in the state 
he wait like a dull cipher and I have 
my spy upon he if I find he busy 
my power with the king shall soon transplant he 
or force he like Riviero his old friend 
but of more brain and faction to give up 
his ghost abroad 

it be just for your own safety 

this be a honest easy nobleman 
allow to wear some court formality 
walk on the tar pick his tooth and stroke 
upon a festival some golden sentence 
out of his beard for which the guard admire he 
and cry he up a statesman he be send off 
when he be troublesome to a phlegmatic clime 
a dull ambassador no that duke Guido 
be all my fear but I have contrive something 
may rectify my fate 

how much you honour i 
but you may spare all other entertainment 
and bravery of court they may affect 
my eye with wonder and oblige my just 
acknowledgement but all their glory be meet 
into one height hold no proportion 
to inflame my heart or more express my welcome 
then this your free grace madam and those hope 
that bless my imagination from your favour 

I be but what my brother love and virtue 
will make i but there be nothing that can move 
with his consent I shall flee to obey 

I have rather feed upon his heart 
you promise sir the duke to hunt this morning 

I have forget will you be please to try 
the pleasure of a forest 

I will attend 

Theodosia you be not for that exercise Guido 

I wish all pleasure wait upon you 
my heart must covet your return 

and i 
to dwell for ever in so fair a bosom 

to horse the morning waste 

some policy 
must cure this fear my bold resolve be fix 
I have make some attempt and court she 
but she have not understand i I must work 
by countermine and scatter into air 
his swell hope Octavio 

my good lord 

sir I present this gentleman to kiss 
your hand he be the duke secretary a roman 
bear and have a great ambition 
to be know to you for your father sake 
with who he do converse in Rome and honour 
till death conclude their acquaintance 

sir 
your love and knowledge of my father will 
deserve you shall be welcome to his son 

he make i his companion many year 
no brother be more chain in their affection 
he do impart much of his bosom to i 

you know why he leave Naples 

he do trust i with the cause my lord and every circumstance 
the king minority and Montalto power 
against which no innocent can plead in Naples 

not too loud sir you may be hear 

your pardon 

why shall truth 
faint at the name of greatness this colossus 
Montalto be but mortal sure time have 
forget to use his wing or nature be 
unwilling I shall grow to write full man 
to take revenge upon that politician 
our protean favourite 

it be my wonder 
the king so strange shall continue this 
affection to Montalto 

there be some magic in it 

dare none complain 

his engine be so place 
none can approach the king ear at which hang 
so many flatterer to infect it with 
Montalto praise 

pray give i sir this boldness 
he that do lift a axe to strike the root 
of any family can be without 
a thought to wound the branch you be leave 
by computation but a infant when 
your father discontent and faction of 
this Montalto make he forsake Naples 
which add to your mother death the guard 
and comfort of your life be take from you 
have express this malice to your father 
a thousand way he may have send you to 
another world and take off all fear 
of a revenge how come it that you live 
and visit sir the palace with this freedom 

my lord Andrugio knowledge of yon sir 
be my assurance of your faith 

I will give 
you reason at some opportunity 
not to repent your confidence 

you have 
supply my fathel in your care of i 
I live why I be this great lord favourite 
court his creature be my honour 
companion to his pleasure 

I observe

with title of his bedchamber 

it be strange 
this news will cool my resolution 

it be truth he do engage he to all favour 

it be not impossible he may be honest 

and mean so but my soul can be bribe 
so easy to prostrate my own justice 
and leave my father ash unrevenged 
which in my ear groan from beneath the marble 
to keep my thought awake 

we may suspect 
this be to catch applause a trick to win 
upon the people who do love Riviero 
and mourn his fate 

however I have art 
to keep my breast close and accept his flattery 
can compliment and with officious bend 
thank his high favour wear a face of mirth 
and prattle with the lady as if all 
the business I come into the world for 
be but to talk and dance and go a feast 

I must presume you want no counsel from 
my lord who love your father how to manage 
yourself to best advantage of your fame 
and honour unto both I be a servant 

my lord Montalto may expect you sir 

it be not safe we be observe too much

Come my lord

I understand not what it mean I know 
the word but never can apply the sense 
or find it in a passion more than ordinary 

Cupid have lose his quiver then he can not 
be arm and let you escape who sole captivity 
will be more glory than the conquest make 
as poet feign upon the god 

it be language 
with which you be please to mock your humble handmaid 

but this assure he blind 

he will deserve 
to lose his eye indeed if he shall aim 
a shaft at i 

madam you have a heart 

to which no other 
flame can approach then what shall light it to 
obedience of your will and my good mother 

obedience to my will what if it be 
my will that you shall love

one I will present a servant why that blush 
the word be not immodest there do want 
no blood upon your cheek to make it lovely 
or do it slow in silence to express 
that which your virgin language will not be 
so soon hold guilty of consent 

to what 

to love by my direction a man 
who worth consider shall deserve thou too 
and in the noble way invite thy freedom 
until the holy priest declare your heart 
be knit into one blessing there be no harm 
in this 

most royal sir I know not with 
what word to say you honour i how can 
one so unworthy as poor Domitilla 
be entertain within your thought and care 
in this high nature 

though your mother have 
make both her person and yourself a stranger 
to court I have have eye upon your virtue 
which wait on by a most ample fortune 
I have study to advance if you will accept 
a husband of a my choice what say you madam 

I have a mother sir 

she shall think it fortunate 
above expectation you have not vow yourself 
to a cold nunnery 

not I sir 

when 
I shall declare how precious he be 
to my own bosom 

royal sir this language 
must needs prepare a welcome I shall think 
my heart unlike another woman not 
to obey a charm so powerful as your praise 
but when you be consider as my king 
duty take off the merit of my will 
and humble every thought beneath obedience 

his name be 

pardon I beseech you sir 
conceal it yet what gentle spirit walk 
upon my blood I dare not look upon he 
my hope my fear it be enough great sir 
that you leave one within your thought you will 
commend to Domitilla one your love 
and precious to your bosom sure you bless he 
with such a character 

it be too short 

my heart be a false prophet it be a fate 
too good and great for Domitilla 

Well his name shall be reserve but when it open 
itself to your knowledge you will honour it 
and thank i Domitilla in the mean time 
let the opinion you have of i 
live in your trust and make room in your heart 
to meet the husband I shall bring 

why may not this be mean by his own person 
more wonder have be read in story I 
find thick but amorous tremble in my heart 
he be king why not love have do strange thing 
and can lead captive the proud heart of king 

here none can reach our voice be free and clear 

first let i kiss your hand on which I swear 
to speak all truth it be justice to your person 
your merit and my faith next though the secret 
may both concern and benefit your knowledge 
I shall desire your pardon 

you prepare i 
for wonder if it be a act of friendship 
to i it will become i to reward it 
not thanks nor pardon 

but all truth meet not 
with charitable ear there be a descant 
that please not sometime though the best art 
present it if our sense be indispose 
to patience and calm hear 

do not doubt i 

it will not become i so much as in thought 
to inquire how long or with what firm devotion 
you affect the princess Theodosia 
but Naples be more conscious then to doubt 
you bring a welcome treaty in your person 
and every voice and heart be busy with 
the expectation of your marriage 
while every eye bright with your flame be able 
to light a torch to Hymen virgin have 
no other care then with what flower sweet 
as your own name to adorn the smile altar

it will come 
to fast upon your knowledge have you never 
look from the prospect of your palace window 
when some fair sky court your eye to read 
the beauty of a day the glorious sun 
enrich so the bosom of the earth 
that tree and flower appear but like so much 
enamel upon gold the wanton bird 
and every creature but the drudge ant 
despise providence and at play and all 
that world you measure with your eye so gay 
and proud as winter be no more to shake 
his icy lock upon they but the breath 
of gentle Zephyr to perfume their growth 
and walk eternal upon the spring 
when from a coast you see not come a cloud 
creep as overload with a storm 
dark as the womb of night and with her wing 
surprise all the glory you behold 
leave not your fright eye a light to see 
the ruin of that flatter day 

this language 
carry both mystery and horror pray 
my lord convey your meaning to my knowledge 

I shall I have in vain prepare you thus else 
pardon again the story Theodosia 
more beautiful than the day I figure by she 
be quite overcast and look through a eclipse 
upon your love she have no heart but what 
another be possess of 

ha 

I know 
it can but afflict your thought that all 
your expectation ripe and court to 
the enjoy such a treasure as she be 
must finish in embrace of a shadow 
invite to a fable not a bride 
that shall with joy dwell in your princely arm 
for Theodosia without sacrilege 
can be you she be contract 

how 
the king of Naples must not sir engage 
Florence to such a mockery 

it be my duty 
to clear his honour in it he have a pure 
intention to make his sister you her close 
though honourable love be design without 
his knowledge and you will but waste your rage 
upon her destiny which will bury she 
in her own ruin if your anger make 
the king her enemy 

I do not find 
my heart in any disposition 
to break at hear of this news but wish it 
truth to prepare room for another guest 
the fair Domitilla be here saint 

your excellency 

must not be thus affront 
Montalto and return with this dishonour 
be there no cheap person to be make 
ridiculous in Naples 

calm your blood 
I know you must resent it but let not 
your passion make the world believe you shall 
despair to find one apt to your bosom 
the rich beauty in the world your birth 
and fortune must deserve and I shall curse 
my forward duty to your grace 

no more 
I have consider better and although 
your love may merit thanks yet this intelligence 
will concern my faith this can be sir 

my honour be engage then to convince you 
though with the hazard of my life and fortune 
both which must now depend upon your mercy 
your breath shall make they bleed or live 

what mean 
Montalto 

to translate the power of all 
my star and make you lord of my whole fate 
Theodosia heart sir shall be i by free 
gift of herself who have be please to take 
my vow in the exchange which now may boast 
some time and growth which can not be a sin 
against your love with which all that can spring 
from i deserve no name nor dare I take 
boldness to call her i who be a thing 
light than air in balance with your grace 
if you but chide the ambition and can render 
though I commit a rape on my own life 
all that her love have promise i 

it be strange 

but she let i take freedom to be plain 

be not to be reduce you will say 

sir woman 
love not with that safeguard upon their passion 

she have a wise art to dissemble then 

it be fear it shall arrive at the king knowledge 
in who displeasure she be lose and not 
a will to mock your grace for who there be 
another wound within her mind that she 
shall wear a smile summer in her brow 
yet frost within her heart in which unhappy 
she come to near the nature of the adamant 
hard to your grace who she attract but love 
your wisdom know be in the volume of 
our fate decree who period when they be 
by time make know greatness on earth that mean 
to play the tyrant with we may have strength 
to punish not reverse 

I be confirm 
and prosper in my thought 

it take 

my lord 
you have expression act of confidence 
which I must not betray though to my loss 
it be some happiness to know this early 
we may be expect you shall find i sir 
a prince but no usurper 

I be your creature 
the king 
we build upon your piety 
until some little time may call our love 
out of this silence 

you understand i madam 

and be honour 

her eye beget new wonder I shall be observe 

Come now to horse 

I shall attend your entertainment have 
oblige we madam 

it be not worth such guest 
but prayer and duty must supply 

now madam you be a great part of my care 
depend upon i for a husband 

be it not plain 

madam another guest must take his leave 
that here will choose his palace 

you be gracious and but encourage more to honour you 

I will creep and kiss thy altar love allow 
they flame and knit more charm upon her brow 

it be thy old quarrel against Montalto make 
thou incredulous I dare believe he love 
Theodosia 

it be not that I question sir 
but that part which concern her love to he 
sound like a plot upon your nature to 
secure his own ambition 

why the princess 
may love as great a heart have be make stoop 

your grace shall else in vain court she yourself 
and late your highness think she meet your person 
a fair design of love with all the soft 
behaviour of a princess 

but it be not 
impossible a lady shall dissemble 

Allow she but the honour she be bear with 
and she will not stain her blood so much 

but love 
must be obey and prepossession 
of heart be a lewd thing to wrestle with 
I make it my own case and if I love 
another lady better than the princess 
as every man be not proof against all beauty 
I think I shall be constant too it will 
be something to remove I 

then the king 

he know not and I have bind myself in honour 
not to betray if they be decree 
to make a marriage a soft destiny 
attend their love 

there be some mystery 
but will you rest and take for grant she 
do love Montalto if it be a truth 
you be in the same condition when she 
confirm it 

it be not good to be busy 
in search of these unwelcome certainty 
there be hope while thing be cloud in suspicion 

but so your jealousy may wound her honour 
which you may cure by knowledge 

I will think on it 
mean time let this dwell in that honest silence 
you have possess there be another secret 
may follow 

you must challenge my whole bosom 
and I be confident your highness will 
steer all your resolution by honour 
which in a prince be sacred 

sir the lord 
Montalto be come up 

then try your art upon he 
and inform yourself I will take 
my time to appear 

I obey 
my honour lord 

most noble Philberto 
where be the duke 

if you will but excuse a few minute 

it be 
my duty to attend 

how be it with the princess my good lord 

the princess she be in health why this to I 
he be of inward counsel with the duke 
I must be resolute 

I ask because 
his grace intend a present visit to she 
and be but now in mention of your lordship 
to bear he company 

I like not that 
he know he may command my service 

he will deserve your love pray my lord tell I 
and let we be plain breasted you enjoy 
the king as I but with less stock of merit 
the favour of his excellence how affect you 
the present state of thing will it be a match 
there be loud expectation in the world 
and after all my master be fond to have it 
proceed to these I be of opinion 
there be no retreat now without dishonour 
yet as I be Philoberto I much pity 
he shall through any wound to your affection 
perfect his love 

he have tell you then the secret 
and not to waste more language I collect 
from what you have express he do resolve 
to destroy i Montalto must be tread on 

not so my lord 

yes and my heart the ascent 
to his hymeneal altar which must be 
make crimson with the blood of a true lover 
his will be obey Theodosia shall see 
to advance she Montalto will go smile 
to his sacrifice and after many prayer 
that she may live the darling of his heart 
I will change my acquaintance of this world to be 
at peace in my own ash 

you will not 
commit a violence upon yourself 

I shall not need the thought of she will kill I 
with as much silence as I go to sleep 
I only shall bleed inward and my life 
remove itself like a fair apparition 
that vanish to the eye and with less noise 
than a calm summer evening but when I 
be dead it be not impossible some may 
report Theodosia be but ravish from i 
fear of a brother anger and the trick 
of politic state that marry to knit power 
not heart do force she to herares arm 
while I tear from the branch where I once grow 
travel I know not whether in the air 

I begin 
to think he worth some pity 

into what 
vain thing will the severe apprehension 
of grief transform we coward let the duke 
move with all amorous haste to his delight 
and glory in the hope of his fair bride 
i by the gift of heaven and heart but all 
my flower grow dull on their stalk and wither 
let she gay paranymph with rosy chaplet 
which will take all their colour from her blush 
attend on Theodosia to the temple 
while as they go no rude wind shall be hear 
but so much breath of heaven as gentle may 
lift their loose hair up whisper my wrong 
to every virgin care let they be marry 
knit hand and plight a ceremonious faith 
let all the triumph waste let they be waste 
and night itself bribe with a thousand form 
of mirth and revel till the night grow faint 
and pale with watch 
invite to bed yet there he shall enjoy 
but Theodosia body and not that 
as his fair thought expect perhaps the conquest 
of one who he love better 

How be that 

now shall I trust he if my sense mistake not 
Theodosia may not be a virgin 

it be 
his bold conclusion 

where be now the honour 
you talk of dare Montalto charge she with 
this stain without his conscience to assure it 

yes and to i this tender he the more 
to be suspect and I be so far 
from think she affect Montalto that 
I be convince he love she not can he 
have any noble thought of Theodosia 
that dare traduce her honour think of that 
and can revenge in any lover be 
a reason to wound a lady fame it taste 
of rank injustice and some other end 
time will discover and yet your grace be bind 
to have his accusation confirm 
or haunt this spot panther to his ruin 
who breath be only sweet to poison virtue 

what I resolve inquire not 

I see through 
Montalto soul and have be so long tame 
in my own suffering but this will make 
he ripe for punishment Andrugio and 
my son 

I can with the wing of duty 
fly swift enough to prostrate my obedience 
and welcome from a long suppose death 
my honour father 

then I must appear so 

and let i give a son up to your blessing 
worthy your best prayer and embrace it be time 
to bring you acquaint he have else this night 
contrive Montalto tragedy at a banquet 
for your revenge his active thought I can not 
counsel no long patience 

thou have but 
prevent i Octavio I be 
weary of my concealment 

but my joy be wild 
and will I fear transport i 

my best friend 
and my own spirit boy fear not Montalto 
he be now upon a precipice his fate 
stoop with the glorious burden of his pride 
thing may be worth our counsel we shall see 
this prodigy that will be hold a star 
and do so fright we with his stream hair 
drop like a comet and be lose in the air 

be it possible the day shall be so old 
and not a visit from the duke 

while he 
enjoy health I shall easy forgive 
a little ceremony 

and a lover 
your grace must chide he other man may have 
excuse for their neglect of time but he 
that love deserve no pardon 

judge with charity 
my lord the case may be your own you will 
think she a cruel mistress that shall doom 
your life to exile for not payment of 
one ceremonious visit 

not where such 
perfection be to engage my service madam 
pardon the bold comparison death be not 
enough to punish that rude thought that can 
start from your bright idea or converse 
with prater that do not first concern your excellence 
I will not be ambitious of a blessing 
but from reflex of you 

you will express 
a most officious servant to that lady 
be honour in your thought but the duke of Florence 
and I shall make no such severe condition 

if he do love you madam that will teach he 
above what ceremony prescribe to honour you 

if he do love 

your grace pardon I 
speak from a honest freedom take from 
the assurance of your goodness that know better 
how to distinguish truth I be not judge 
of his breast madam 

I suppose you be not 

and yet be a man another way 
conclude his passion be but such as have 
be read in humane nature 

what infer you 
from hence my lord 

nothing but that a prince 
may be no saint in love 

how be that 

it be in my fear I shall displease 

your will 

not for the empire of the world I shall 
repent I live with your suspicion 
upon my humble soul 

pray sir be free 
touch the duke I must know all what be it 
make he no saint 

madam he be not dead 
and in his life I see no miracle 

you talk of love 

no miracle of love

devotion to a mistress but 

what speak 
I charge thou by the memory of what 
thou do affect most 

though it wound myself 
be arm and hear it how I blush within i 
to tell your highness Florence have transplant 
his heart and all his active thought be place 

on who 

on Domitilla 

ha 

I do observe they madam at her mother house 
where we be late feast after hunt 
how strange he be take how his eye 
do wanton with her face and on her hair 
tie many golden knot to keep love chain 
but these be but suspicion he since 
confess to i in hope to win i to 
negotiate his affair how at first sight 
he take in desperate flame and that she rule 
the intelligence of his soul I hear the king 
have send for she to court which must give madam 
a dangerous opportunity to actuate 
his end with your dishonour I be unwilling 
to speak this knowledge of his hasty change 
but all my bond of piety and faith 
will have be forfeit into a long silence 

shall I be thus affront 

we see prince 
who we call god on earth in the affair 
of love turn man again 

for Domitilla 

that be the dishonour madam and infect 
my brain to think on it and as much beneath 
your grace in all the ornament of soul 
and person as she be in blood if my 
impartial thought may take so bold commission 
to judge between your beauty 

be it possible 

it be too certain madam I shall be 
a villain to accuse the duke unjust 
or bring but shadow of a truth for though 
he be unworthy of your love that dare 
thus value your perfection below 
that Phantom Domitilla let not passion 
make you too rash in manage a cause 
on which depend your fame compare to which 
ten thousand life add to i be nothing 
observe he at next visit 

I will study thanks sir

but live within your memory 

This trouble i 

be they both come to court 

and in those lodging be prepare

yes sir but something 
I nigh discern like trouble and by start 
in Domitilla but they be please with their 
remove and wait all your command 

so leave we 

where be the duke 

I think to have meet he here 

be Domitilla come to court

by my command to wait on thou 

to rival i 

how be that 
I mean she a wife for good Montalto 
as the reward of his just service 
he know it not as he be ignorant 
for who I have prepare she rival strange 
I must know more of this she be in nature 
too apprehensive for although in love 
suspicion to man a torment be 
there be no fiend to woman jealousy 

you may do what you will madam put i 
into fine clothes and make a ass of i 
but shall you wrap i in a lion skin 

you have ear that will betray what beast you be 

pray madam tell i in six word of sense 
what shall I do here I will not see the king 
though he have cunning devise this trick 
only to bring i hither and betray i 
to office make i at least a idol 

what be that 

a idol in the country I have read 
a thing we call a worshipful a right worshipful 
descend from the house of the factotum 
lord of the soil and cock of his own dunghill 

you may be out of fear you can read now 
nor set your name to a warrant 

all that nothing 
ignorance every day come into fashion 
and no mean statesman now when they do write 
their name do for their honour so contrive it 
you can hardly know a nobleman from a mark 

if you be a enemy to all preferment 
your best way be to leave the world and turn 
a lay friar 

no I find no such thing in my constitution 
every man be not bind to be religious 
man of my bulk and bear shall not fast so 
I be not give by nature to drink water 
or lie without a shirt I have corn madam 
and I will make less conscience to undo 
my shoemaker then walk on wooden pantofle 
I will endure to serve you still and dwell here 
so you conceal i from the king it be not 
that I do owe his majesty ill will 
I can endure he too upon condition 
he will make nothing on i 

why he shall 
make nothing on thou take my word or if 
thou have a mind I will pray he make thou less 

no I will be a middling christian 
but what will you do hear yourself you will be in 

with who do think 

And cast away yourself 
upon some pageant one who wit must be 
behold to another wool to keep it warm 
one that can dance and sing and wag his feather 
a artificial calf carrier 
a youth that be sow together by his tailor 
and take apieces by his surgeon 

why how now secretary 

I can say more 

be this wit natural 

you be best say 
I get it here at court pray heaven I do not 
lose what I bring I have a wholesome wit 
in the country ask the parish and the parson 
for I keep company with those that read 
and learn wit now by the ear if any slip from i 
as where there be a plenty some will out 
here be so many wit catcher a lose maidenhead 
be soon find and set upon the shoulder 
of the right owner 

I prithee tell i Bombo 
and tell i truth do not you think yourself 
after all this a fool

I shall not have be tempt hither then 
by which I have endanger my good part 
to state employment but I will be wise enough 
he have not see i yet nor shall if 
there be a witch in Naples or a mist 
that will be buy for money to walk the court in 
but take your course and I be at home again 

what then 

I will live in the cellar the wine cellar 

it be your humility 

there be some fortification to be make 
against the court invasion countermine 
of sand and sack a man may thrust himself 
among the bottle and defy the world 
be drink and not be call out of his sleep 
to go ambassador 

So so fear not 
have a strong faith and thou may die in the country 
for all this here be my mother let your care 
be now that none may interrupt we 

I will do any thing but see the king 

with pardon madam you seem full of thought 

I be study Domitilla why the king 
shall send for we to court 

mother you can 
mention the king in any act of his 
that be not glorious and like himself 
he be the great example of a king 
but rich in his soul then state 

but why 
to we this favour to call we from those 
cold and obscure shade of a retirement 
to plant we here near his own beam 

he have some meaning in it 

it it be yet dark to i 

we shall not stain his court his sister be but 
a lady of more distinction of birth 
yet all that have be prince come not to 
their state by a descant the herald know 
some be not bear to purple and to sceptre 
that have be queen virtue have raise some 
and beauty have have many charm to rule 
the heart of king 

what be all this Domitilla 
I hope you be not dream of a queen 
such wild interpretation of the king 
favour to we can be make without 
the forfeit of wit and duty which 
shall teach we to contain our thought in their 
own sphere and not to point they upon object 
above our level 

I betray myself 
when I say beauty have a power to charm 
a king it may acquit i from suspicion 
of any hope to apply they so ambitious 
you will grant it just to love the king 

our duty 

and he may where he please place his affection 

leave that to she it may concern 

and she 
that be mark for so great honour shall be mad 
to quarrel with her kind fate 

what be all this 
to thou 

to i why mother be it not possible 
a lady not much fair than myself 
may be a queen great prince have eye 
like other man and I shall sin against 
what heaven and nature have bestow on i 
shall my fate smile to think my face will be 
the bar to such preferment 

leave this 
which be but mirth I know since we be fall 
into discourse of love what will you answer 
to lord Montalto if he come woo 
and recommend by the king 

I will 
even recommend he to the king again 

be not his favourite worth your love if he 
descend to be your servant 

as a servant 
he may be entertain and be I queen 
perhaps he shall be favourite to both 
and I will smile upon his service 
in imitation of the king while he 
preserve his modest duty and his distance 

my daughter be transport sure you be 
no queen sweet Domitilla 

it be a truth 
nor be Montalto yet my favourite 

I hope she be not so miserable to affect 
the king by who direction I prepare 
she for Montalto 

a sprig of the nobility call Octavio 
desire access 

admit he 

I must let this passion cool and leave she 

welcome to court why so this sphere become you 
or rather it take ornament from you 
now Domitilla shine indeed your presence 
do throw new beam about the palace madam 
before we look as we have lose our genius 

you come not from the king with any message 

I make this haste to tender my own service 

you have no other suit to i 

yes madam 

speak it 

and I will not wander much about shall I 
be admit a young lover 

Men must not love till they be one and twenty 
they will be mad before they come to age else 

this law be never decree in the parliament 
of Cupid such a statute will undo 
many sweet virgin like yourself yet if 
you will promise to stay for i I shall think it 
a happy expectation we be both 
young we may choose each other Valentine 
and couple as we grow more ripe hereafter 

I will ask you but one question my lord 
what will you give to be the king of Naples 

I dare not think so ambitious 

it be modest what if I can love under a prince 

can he be less who you will make happy 
to boast in the possession of your fair 
person a thousand province those eye 
be able to create another Indies 
all the delight that dwell in bless Tempe 
divine bud and blossom in your cheek 
the treasure of Arabia in your breath 
nor Thebes alone as to Amphion lute 
stoop to the heavenly magic of your voice 
but all the world 

no more of this these praise 
be make for child and will make truth blush 
they may fill up where nature be defective 
and be I queen of Naples I shall punish 
such flattery but you be young and may 
outgrow this vanity 

you be merciful 

I shall be ever so to you Octavio 
let this encourage you to think I love you 
in the first place of those which be bear subject 
if you will answer my respect forbear 
to question further 

I shall wait sometime and kiss your hand 

and if my power may 
prevail to do you favour with the king 
make your address 

have not the court transform she 

methinks I move upon a state already 
and yet it be not the glory of his title 
affect my hope so much his Person be lovely 
and both together make the charm I do 
expect his royal presence how shall I 
behave my look when he declare himself

which of themselves betray their want of lustre 
and come with a ambition to recover 
flame from your smile

to take these from a prince 
the king with wing 
I will haste to meet he 

go and so abrupt 
her business may allow her breath to thank i 
for my rich present but I will follow she 
I will not meet the king here if she prove

more for her honour she will mock no prince 
I be not lose to Florence yet though I

of any lady who shall preingage 
her heart to another bosom and then sneak 
off like a tame despise property 
when her end be advance 

I understand not 
this passion yet it point upon something 
that may be dangerous to conclude Theodosia 
be Naples sister and I must not see 
she lose to honour though my kingdom bleed

but I will love thou like one let we call 
a counsel of our thought and mingle sorrow 
yet when we have do all and tire our breath 
there be no cure for love but love or death 

how will Montalto counsel i I be 
wild with the repetition 

the duke 
lay such a black aspersion on your sister 
it be blasphemy to honour but as soon 
he may pollute the sun beam or defile 
the dew of heaven ere it approach the earth 
make we believe the rock of ice do flame 
and may endanger the north star my wonder 
will make i reason least it throw a poison 
on your whole family a stain so deep 
and so prodigious all the blood within 
his dukedom will purge it can he find 
no excuse for his revolt to Domitilla 
but blast the sweet princess

prepare to be thy bride as a addition 
to the reward I owe thy service

to let lose these suspicion to the descant 
of people tongue the air be dangerous 
let i search the duke bosom for the spring 
of this dishonour

and the receiver of his thought leave i 
to manage this great work I have a way

king be your leave I vanish 

this paper contain wonder it be not possible 

upon my life sir Philoberto can demonstrate these 

the devil have not art 
to abuse we so this will require some counsel 
he be here 
Montalto leave we 

sir your pleasure 

be all in thou haste meet with Philoberto 

not yet 

no matter I have think upon it 
and do conclude it best to let thing pass 
yet in a dream choice and enquiry may 
awake suspicion upon innocence 

you can think her guilty sir 

I be not 
without some fear I have collect thing 
since we confer that stagger my good thought 

of she you can sir unthink again 
whatever will betray she to your jealousy 
a virgin monument can be more chaste 
in the temple 

yes yes we may be all cozen 
and therefore let she pass among thing desperate 
yet be I certain she be spot thus 
as it be but a young leprosy upon she 
I can wish hearty my sister timely 
marry not to the duke that will betray we 
but to some one I know not who can love 
we both so well as be that rare friend 
and save our honour 

do you then suspect she 

o the duke character have a powerful sense 
and who know but she may be lose by one 
not fit to make her reparation 
can any nobleman be find in Naples 
to bind her wound up by so great a act 
of secrecy and marriage but some wind 
may listen and convey I know not whither 
what my sad breath have scatter in the air 
thy master have no servant that dare take 
one sorrow from he 

you be sir provide 
of more than that can rise to in my service 

can thou be so compassionate to lose 
thy hope of rich beauty for my sake 
dare thou with all this knowledge hide her stain 
and marry she 

my duty to your majesty 
shall marry i to death let not this trouble 
the quiet of your heart I will take Theodosia 
and think upon she as she have the whiteness 
of my good angel 

thou be a miracle 
teach i but which way I may reward this love 
till now I have no poverty thy worth 
will make i everlasting in debt 
what shall I say 

great sir no more your favour 
flow from a bounty which have only heaven 
above it 

they be all trifle let i see 
be nothing in thy power to make thou find 
my gratitude how barren be we wealth 
honour 

there be nothing good or great you have not 
free possess i with your favour will 
so mighty have they fall upon i rather 
express a storm and I have sink beneath 
the welcome violence have not your love 
from whence they flow enable i to strength 
and manly bear 

I be improvident 
to reserve nothing or it be a fault 
in thou to be so prodigal of merit 
in thy past service can thou think of nothing 
worth my addition 

Nothing sir 

I have it 
and thank my better genius I have it 
such a reward Montalto that I dare 
be modest yet pronounce never do prince 
exceed it to his friend 

sir you amaze i 
and shame my want of merit 

in the title 
let king peruse the benefit and study 
a imitation to their best love creature 
they be great as fortune can invent I will teach thou 
a way Montalto to know all thy friend 
and enemy 

that be a precious knowledge 
be it in nature with your highness pardon 
the heart of man be not to be measure 
with what we reach the star or fathom sea 
o he that be active in a state have more 
chain to he by the power and strength of office 
then genuine respect and it be not worth 
or person but the fortune of a statesman 
that sometime man adore 

it be true and therefore 
I be proud in this that I can teach thou look 
into man soul to know they fit for scorn or 
thy embrace 

how may this sir be do 

almost in the twinkle of a eye too 

strange 

I seem to frown upon thou 

how sir 

do apprehend i I will counterfeit 
that I be displease with thou do not mistake i 
and have it voice about the court thou be 
consign do mark at this will all thy enemy 
who heart thou can not see their tongue before 
by thy great power silence join in faction 
complain discover their whole stock of malice 
tickle their spleen that thou be out of favour 
who I shall hear and smile at then all those 
who honest soul deserve thou will rise up 
the champion of thy same of the other side 
and be so many orator to make 
thy faith and honour shine when this do 
the scene be change I send for thou thou come 
with a most glorious train and then I will smile 
take thou again in the sight of all discover 
it be but a trick thy friend keep still thy bosom 
and thou in triumph shoot a scorn with i 
to strike all envy dumb be it not a rate one 
I can do enough for thou Montalto 

you have find out a way I must confess 
but with your pardon I shall be more able 
to do you service in the other ignorance 
than ruin a desperate hazard in this knowledge 
some hold it sin and capital enough 
to have the princess favour which once lose 
though but in suspicion they may rage 
and like a torrent rise to overwhelm nature 

these shall wound thou 

and how other judge 
may wrest the action of a man employ 
though never so faithful to his king and state 

I be confident of thy justice and decree 
thy triumph in it thy goodness thus conspicuous 
render thou love and fit for Theodosia 
when she be bright the sun never smile 
more cheerful upon teem earth 
than I to find thou perfect for I do 
but seem displease come I will have it so 
if thou do love i no dispute but let i 
pursue my fancy mean to do thou honour 
who wait

you know the way my lord to your own lodging 
from whence on peril of our anger stir not 
until we send for you Octavio 

do we not dream 

Something will creep 
like a dead sleep upon i I be in 
a labyrinth but hence with coward fear 
I know the worst grim death can but translate 
i hence and there be a end of death and fate 

he comfort and counsel Domitilla 
I have my part in love affliction 

this I fear 
I must acquaint the king where be your fellow 
Bombo his mirth may now be seasonable 

he be go madam

back to the country house he hear of my lord 
Montalto disgrace and the fear of his supply 
the place of a favourite send he away this morning 
with all his movable the country he say

his time come he dare not stay to see the king 

will we have still be stranger to the court 
leave we my daughter be much bind to your grace 

it be the king you speak of pray be careful 
you speak all goodness of he he deserve it 
and will when I be dead 

I will lose no time 

I wish it prosper 

I dare not say the king dissemble with i 
that be a fault beyond my love but sure 
something he say that make my heart believe 
he do not mean i for another and 
Montalto who reward I must be think 
be now consign and under his displeasure 

he will have more care of his honour then 
to place thou so unworthy Montalto 
have play the cunning traitor with our love 
if I may trust thou noble Philoberto 
that tell i the whole story of his falsehood 
which I before suspect 

and if he shall despise i as it be justice 
will heaven be angry if I love he still 
or will the king call it a treason in i 
if he do I can willing die for it 
and with may last word pray he may live happy 
but why be I this trouble to your grace 
my story be not worth one of your minute 
dear madam pardon i and teach i how 
to make my time more happy spend in something 
that may concern your highness you do love too 

madam the duke of Florence 

how the duke 

why do he visit i madam indeed 
you may believe I love he not 

admit he 
I prithee and conceal i Domitilla 
I know he come woo to thy beauty 
I prithee let i hear the second part 

I shall against my own desire obey you 

the ambition of my eye can not be think 
immodest if they ever wish to dwell here 
they have find their light again let no misfortune 
be a second cause to bury i in darkness 

your grace pardon if my haste to attend 
the king and his command make i appear 
rude when I leave your excellence 

this do more 
than satisfy 

I know not how I may 
stand guilty in your thought by keep a 
rich caskanet 

you honour i to accept it 

but with a blush I must remember too 
I do not thank you there be want of time 
or manner I must leave it to your mercy 
and will by any duty to your grace 
expiate my error 

madam it be not worth 
the mention of this gratitude your breath 
make the oblation rich and i who be 
encourage by your virtue to present you 
with something of more value than a world 
of these poor empty glory I dare give you 
my heart madam 

bless your grace from such a meaning 

can you be cruel to it 

I never have 
the confidence to look upon a wound 
and such a bleed object as your heart 
will fright my sense 

you be more ingenious 
than not to understand that I mean love 
I love you madam best of all your sex 

you can sir you dare not 

how 

you dare not be so wicked I be be sure 
when you remember what you be a prince 

be it a sin for prince to love madam 

or if you can dispense with so much passion 
to love i and dare give i what I tremble 
to think you promise that that very act 
in which you most advance affection to i 
will make i think you love i not 

be clear 

how shall I think his courtship worth my trust 
and meet he with a real change of heart 
who in his very first attempt of love 
will blast my honour and betray i to 
a shame black as the tongue of infamy 

will I 

and more 
for you in this 
will tempt i to a act by which I shall 
not only wound myself to death of honour 
but make i guilty of another blood 
and kill a innocent lady who least tear 
be worth a thousand life of perjure man 
that make a scorn of virtue 

what lady 

have you forget the princess sir 

the princess 

in that name you will find yourself again 
lose in a mist of passion o think 
the fame and hope of two rich country be 
engage upon your faith your highness pardon 
I find some blush chide my too much boldness 
and by a near view now of your goodness 
I see my error to believe you mean 
other than trial of i or can fall 
to any thought beneath your birth and honour 

but if Theodosia be make another 
by her own gift and I at large with what 
justice may I be think then to address 
my passion hither 

if the princess which 
I must not think give your heart back again 
and that you can quit all your tie with honour 
my thought be all resign to the king will 
he must dispose of i by my own vow 
without his free consent never to marry 

the king there it be I think she be his mistress 
it be not possible the princess now 
can pardon my neglect Montalto practice 
upon i and his poison of her virtue 
will excuse my shame I dare not see 
who I have injure Theodosia 
in they resolve this night I will steal from Naples 

nay do not hide your face my lord it will 
appear as fresh and lovely to my eye 
as when it first present i your smile 
I be Theodosia still 

but I have be 

abuse time will discover to the ruin 
of his own name and glory of our love 
Montalto practice to divide our sonles 

you can be so merciful or else 
this sweetness be put on to enlarge my guilt 
when we be both compare dare you believe 
I can repent and be revenge 

upon who 

upon myself for suffer my eye 
to wander from this sweetness 

you outdo 
the satisfaction if your grace can find 
i grow again within your heart where first 
my love desire to plant 

o let i drown 
my blush in this over slow of charity 
but there be a act that justice call i to 
before I can be worthy of this peace 
Montalto have play the villain now I find it 
and from his treacherous heart my sword must force 
a bloody satisfaction for thy honour 
poison by he 

stay that revenge shame have 
already sink he 

sir the king desire 
some conference with your grace and with you madam 

I shall attend you sir we shall present 
together thus no object to displease he 

though I shall blush to see he I will wait on you 

good heaven upon what humane bosom shall 
we that be make your substitute on earth 
place secure confidence and yet there may 
be malice in complaint the flourish oak 
for his extent of branch stature growth 
the darling and the idol of the wood 
who awful nod the under tree adore 
shake by a tempest and throw down must need 
submit his curl head and full grow limb 
to every common axe be patient while 
the torture put to every joint the saw 
and engine make with their very noise 
the forest groan and tremble but not one 
when it be in his strength and state revile it 
who poverty of soul and envy send 
to gather stick from the tree wish for rheum 
the great man emblem I do love Montalto 
and wed not have he lose if justice will 
consent and be a little of his side 
but here be the two plummet weigh he down 
his impious practice on the duke and base 
aspersion on our sister that defame 
our whole blood be a loud loud accusation 

his conscience dare not sir deny it 

and you 
speak here the tragic story of Riviero 
who honest soul for not comply with 
his power and end choose in a discontent 
to make himself a exile you pursue 
and by the practice of Montalto poison 
at Rome 

this letter send to Alvarez 
who treacherous physic purge his soul away 
be too much testimony 

it be his character 
Octavio you come for justice too 

it be a vain breath to desire it sir 
your thought be still so conscious of virtue 
they will prevent petition 

come near 

the king be trouble 

where he love to find 
so much ingratitude 

Andrugio 

thing be not yet mature for my discovery 

you observe away 
we may be just Philoberto 
yet not destroy another attribute 
which show who representative we be 
mercy become a king too much can be 
but think a sin on the right hand we be 
resolve 
madam you be welcome 

I begin 
to fear there be some spell upon the king 
if after this Montalto shall prevail 
let innocence be strong to the world 
and heaven be afraid to punish vice 

remove 
for a few minute 

I obey 

you tell i wonder madam alas poor lady 
I shall then have enough to reconcile 
she be too hasty to interpret i 
her lover 

if you sir apply no cure 
the fond impression may I fear endanger 
her sense and life I urge Montalto sir 
by your command before his change of fortune 
but she take no delight to hear he name 

no no nor I good heaven how I be trouble 
how to repair this pretty piece of innocence 
who I have bring into a wake dream 
of passion something I must do pray tell i 
but tell i truth I charge thou by thy duty 
to i to Naples and to heaven or if 
there be in woman faith or thy religion 
any thing else to make it up a full 
and perfect conjuration 

you fright i 
without these not a thought within my heart 
but you have power to summon 

tell i then 
be Domitilla virtuous 

how sir 

be she exceed virtuous be she most 
divine chaste can she do more than blush 
at wanton sound will she be very angry 
at a immodest offer and be fright 
to hear it name tell i do she pray 
and weep and will be tear upon the rack 
ere she consent to stain one virgin think 
or dare she more than Lucrece kill herself 
to save her honour or do something more 
miraculous than all this to preserve 
her white name to posterity 

I know not 
how to reply to these particular 
but if your meaning be to have i speak 
truth of her modest and pare thought she be 
all that her mother can beseech of heaven 
to bless a child with of so chaste a soul 
and virtuous simplicity 

no more 
I do believe and will find out a way 
to make her satisfaction it be just 
say I desire her presence 

now you bless we 
a widow prayer and tear for this great bounty 

your sister and the duke sit 

there be new trouble 

never so love unite 
the pleasant language of their eye and gesture 
do speak their heart at peace 

that will rejoice i 

take we to your love 
all jealousy be banish and we both 
breath from one soul 

my wonder and my joy 

your pardon

the cloud be now remove

how be this 

let i entreat you to obscure your person 
a while 

my lord you be welcome to we very welcome 
we have keep our word and find you have not lose 
your confidence what a brave armour be 
a innocent soul how like a cock it bid 
defiance to a storm against who rib 
the insolent wave but dash themselves in piece 
and fall and hide their head in passionate foam 
how will a guilty person tremble now 
look pale and with his eye chain to the ground 
betray his fear of justice 

where shall honour 
shine with his pure and native lustre but 
where there be such a king so good so great 
the example and reward he must be 
a rebel twice to virtue that can live 
to be convince of a dishonour near 
such a instructive goodness 

where be all his fierce accuser 
call they to his presence 
who all their envy will destroy 

So so 
the king be charm 

they be go upon the first 
news of my lord return they vanish sir 

so may all reason fly the brow of innocence 

it be well say but they shall not fly their name 
read there just to our thought they apprehend 
thou lose in our displeasure where be our sister 
and now they come to be revenge Montalto 
upon our favour 

right and please your grace 

there be something may concern your want of grace 
Andrugio Philoberto

and the duke to you and you may presume 
to use their favour they be here

of Riviero but I must obey 
this fatal revolution

rough as the cause you have to make it frown 
and that may strike i dead without more torment 

ingrateful man be I reward thus

but wound all our honour 

let he find your mercy sir 
for his offence to i

in i of violence to heaven and justice
