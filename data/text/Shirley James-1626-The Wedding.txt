walk up and down thus bury no it be drown 
I can therefore say it be a chest 
Gratiana have never a coffin I have one 
spacious enough for both on his but the wave 
will never yield to it for it may be they 
soon as the northern wind blow cold upon they 
will freeze themselves to marble over she 
lest she shall want a tomb

breath do forgive you but you must expect 
no safety from the law my service sir 

I have leave direction that it can miss i 
and have thou come to apprehend i for it 
with as much ease thou may I be no statesman 
officious servant make no suitor wait

to reward it justice can put on 
a shape to fright i 

I be sorry sir 
your resolution carry so much danger Exit 

what can life bring to i that I shall court it 
there be a period in nature be it not 
better to die and not be sick wear in 
our body which in imitation 
of ghost grow lean as if they woo at last 
be immaterial too our blood turn jelly 
and freeze in their cold channel let i expire 
while I have heat and strength to tug with death 
for victory 

you may disburden there 
but gentle it be a chest of value mistress 
I will give he notice where be Beauford

I do suspect it and have therefore bring 
my assurance with i I must require 
satisfaction for a kinsman death 
one Marwood 

ha 

your valour be not noble 
it be a course reward to kill he for 
his friendship I come not with a guard of 
officer to attach your person it 
be too poor and formal the instrument 
that sluice his soul out I have rather shall 
sacrifice to his ash and my sword 
shall do it or you be guilty of another 
to wait upon his ghost 

young man be not 
too rash without the knowledge how our quarrel 
rise to procure thyself a danger 

make it 
not your fear I have hear the perfect story 
and ere I fight with thou shall see thy error 
acknowledge thou have kill a friend I bring 
a perspective to make those thing that lie 
remote from sense familiar to thou nay 
thou shall confess thou know the truth of what 
concern he or Gratiana 

when my soul 
throw off this upper garment I shall know all 

thou shall not number many minute know 
it be my misfortune to close up the eye 
of Marwood who body I vow never 
shall to the earth without revenge or i 
companion to his grave I have therefore bring it 
hither it be in this house 

ha 

his pale corpse 
shall witness my affection 

thou do promise 
to inform i of Gratiana 

and thus brief 
Marwood reveal at death another witness 
of his truth for Cardona he corrupt 
to betray Gratiana to he 

ha Cardona 
heaven continue she among the live 
but half a hour 

I have save you trouble 
she wait without in your name I procure 
her presence as you have affair with she 
she be unprepared a little terror will 
enforce she to confess the truth of all thing 

thou do direct well 

still remember Beauford 
I be thy enemy and in this do but 
prepare thy conscience of misdeed to 
meet my just anger 

I be all wonder Milisent bring in Cardona 

he be now at opportunity 

sir you send 
to speak with i 

come near I hear say 
you be bawd tell i how go virgin 
in the sinful market nay I must know hellcat 
what be the price you take for Gratiana 
do Marwood come off roundly with his wage 
tell i the truth or by my father soul 
I will dig thy heart out 

help 

let i not hear 
a syllable that have not reference 
to my question or 

I will tell you sir 
Marwood 

So 

do vicious affect she 
win with his gift and flattery I promise 
my assistance but I know her virtue be not 
to be corrupt in a thought 

ha 

therefore 

what do you study 

hold I will deliver 
the rest into your ear it be too shameful 
to express it loud than a whisper 

with what unwillingness we discover thing 
we be ashamed to own Cardona shall 
ha use but half this fear in thy consent 
and thou have never be guilty of a sin 
thou be so loath to part with though it be 
a burden to thy soul how bold will 
out innocence plead for we but she have do 

then be Gratiana honour save 

untouched 

where be I lose this story be more kill 
than all my jealousy o Cardona 
go safe from hence but when thou come at home 
lock thyself up and languish till thou die 
thou shall meet Marwood in a gloomy shade 
give back this salary exit Cardona 

have I make good 
my promise do you find your error 

no I have find my horror have the chaste 
and innocent Gratiana drown herself 
what satisfaction can I pay thy ghost 

now do i right sir 

she be go for ever 
and can the earth still dwell a quiet neighbour 
to the rough sea and not itself be thaw 
into a river let it melt to wave 
from henceforth that beside the inhabitant 
the very genius of the world may drown 
and not accuse i for she o Gratiana 

reserve your passion and remember what 
I come for 

how shall I punish my unjust suspicion 
death be too poor a thing to suffer for she 
some spirit guide i where her body lie 
within her watery urn although seal up 
with frost my tear be warm and can dissolve it 
to let in i and my repentance to she 
I will kiss her cold face into life again 
renew her breath with i on her pale lip 
I do not think but if some artery 
of i be open and the crimson flood 
convey into her vein it will agree 
and with a gentle glide steal itself 
into her heart enliven her dead faculty 
and with a flattery entice her soul again 
to dwell in her fair tenement 

you lose 
yourself in these wild fancy recollect 
and do i justice 

I be lose indeed 
with fruitless passion I remember thou 
and thy design again I must account 
for Marwood death be it not alas thou be 
too young and can not fight I wish thou be 
a man of tough and active sinew for 
thy own revenge sake I will praise thou for 
my death so I may fall but noble by thou 
for I be burden with a weight of life 
stay do not tell i thou have bring hither 
the body of young Marwood 

yes 

since a mistake not malice do procure 
his ill fate I will but drop one funeral 
tear upon his wound and soon finish 
to do thou right 

you shall a coffin bring in 

do this enclose his corpse how little room 
do we take up in death that live know 
no bound here without murmur we can 
be circumscribe it be the soul that make we 
affect such wanton and irregular path 
when that be go we be quiet as the earth 
and think no more of wander o Marwood 
forgive my anger thy confession do 
invite thy ruin from i yet upon open 
my memory forsake i it be Gratiana 
spirit have thou leave thy heavenly dwelling 
to call i hence I be now come to thou 
or but command more haste and I will count it 
no sin to strike myself and in the stream 
of my own blood to imitate how thou 
do drown thyself 

I be live Beauford 

I know thou be immortal 

live as thou be 

good angel do not mock mortality 

And come 

to call i to my answer how I dare 
suspect thy chastity I will accuse myself 
and to thy injure innocence give i up 
a willing sacrifice
