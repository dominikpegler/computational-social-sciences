if you but anger i tell a sowgelder 
have cut you all like colt hold i and kiss i 
for I be too much trouble make up my treasure 
and get i horse private come about it 


thought I assure myself Martell your counsel 
have no end but allegiance and my honour 
yet I be jealous I have pass the bound 
of a son duty for suppose she worse 
than you report not by bare circumstance 
but evident proof confirm have give she out 
yet since all weakness in a kingdom be 
no more to be severe punish than 
the fault of king be by the thunderer 
as oft as they offend to be revenge 
if not for piety yet for policy 
since some be of necessity to be spare 
I may and now I wish I have not look 
with such strict eye into her folly 

sir a duty well discharge be never follow 
by sad repentance nor do your highness ever 
make payment of the debt you owe she better 
than in your late reproof not of she but 
those crime that make she worthy of reproof 
the most remarkable point in which king differ 
from private man be that they not alone 
stand bind to be in themselves innocent 
but that all such as be ally to they 
in nearness or dependence by their care 
shall be free from suspicion of all crime 
and you have reap a double benefit 
from this last great act first in the restraint 
of her lose pleasure you remove the example 
from other of the like licentiousness 
then when it be know that your severity 
extend to your mother who dare hope for 
the least indulgence or connivance in 
the easy slip that may prove dangerous 
to you or to the kingdom 

I must grant 
your reason good Martell if as she be 
my mother she have be my subject or 
that only here she can make challenge to 
a place of be but I know her temper 
and fear if such a word become a king 
that in discover she I have let loose 
a tiger who rage be shut up in darkness 
be grievous only to herself which bring 
into the view of light her cruelty 
provoke by her own shame will turn on he 
that foolish presume to let she see 
the loathe shape of her own deformity 

beast of that nature when rebellious threat 
begin to appear only in their eye 
or any motion that may give suspicion 
of the least violence shall be chain up 
their fang and tooth and all their mean of hurt 
pare of and knock out and so make unable 
to do ill they will soon begin to loathe it 
I will apply nothing but have you grace do 
or will do yet what your less forward zeal 
in word do only threaten far less danger 
will grow from act it on she then may 
perhaps have be from her apprehension 
of what may once be practise for believe it 
who confident of his own power presume 
to spend threat on a enemy that have mean 
to shun the worst they can effect give armour 
to keep off his own strength nay more disarm himself and lie unguarded against all harm 
or doubt or malice may produce 

it be true 
and such a desperate cure I will have use 
if the intemperate patient have not be 
so near i as a mother but to she 
and from i gentle unguent only be 
to be apply and as physician 
when they be sick of fever eat themselves 
such viand as by their direction be 
forbid to other though alike disease 
so she consider what she be may challenge 
those cordial to restore she by her birth 
and privilege which at no suit must be 
grant to other 

may your pious care 
effect but what it aim at I be silent 

what laugh you at sir 

I have some occasion 
I shall not else and the same cause perhaps 
that make i do so may beget in you 
a contrary effect 

why what be the matter 

I see and joy to see that sometime poor man 
and most of such be good stand more indebt 
for mean to breathe to such as be hold vicious 
than those that wear like hypocrite on their forehead 
the ambitious title of just man and virtuous 

speak to the purpose 

who will ever have think 
the good old queen your highness reverend mother 
into who house which be a academic 
in which all principle of lust be practise 
no soldier may presume to set his foot 
at who most bless intercession 
all office in the state be charitable 
confer on pander overwear chamber wrestler 
and such physician as know how to kill 
with safety under the pretence of save 
and such like child of a monstrous peace 
that she I say shall at the length provide 
that man of war and honest young brother 
that will not owe their feed to their codpiece 
shall be esteem of more than mother or drone 
or idle vagabond 

I be glad to hear it 
prithee what course take she to do this 

one that can fail she and virtuous train 
with her jewel and all that be worthy the carry 
the last night leave the court and as it be more 
than say for it be confirm by such as meet she 
she be flee unto your brother 

how 

nay storm not 
for if that wicked tongue of she have not 
forget its pace and Thierry be a prince 
of such a fiery temper as report 
have give he out for you shall have cause to use 
such poor man as myself and thank we too 
for come to you and without petition 
pray heaven reward the good old woman for it 

I foresee this 

I hear a tempest come 
that sing i and my kingdom ruin haste 
and cause a troop of horse to fetch she back 
yet stay why shall I use mean to bring in 
a plague that of herself have leave i muster 
our soldier up we will stand upon our guard 
for we shall be attempt yet forbear 
the inequality of our power will yield i 
nothing but loss in their defeature something 
must be do and do sudden save your labour 
in this I will use no counsel but i own 
that course though dangerous be best command 
our daughter be in readiness to attend we 
Martell your company and honest Vitry 
thou will along with i 

yes anywhere 
to be worse than I be here be past my fear 


you be here in a sanctuary and that viper 
who since he have forget to be a son 
I much disdain to think of as a brother 
have better in despite of all the god 
to have raze their temple and spurn down their altar 
then in his impious abuse of you 
to have call on my just anger 

princely son 
and in this worthy of a near name 
I have in the relation of my wrong 
be modest and no word my tongue deliver 
to express my insupportable injury 
but give my heart a wound nor have my grief 
be from what I suffer but that he 
degenerate as he be shall be the actor 
of my extreme and force i to divide 
the fire of brotherly affection 
which shall make but one flame 

that part of he 
as it deserve shall burn no more if or 
the tear of orphan widow or all such 
as dare acknowledge he to be their lord 
join to your wrong with his heart blood have power 
to put it out and you and these your servant 
who in our favour shall find cause to know 
in that they leave not you how dear we hold they 
shall give Theodoret to understand 
his ignorance of the priceless jewel which 
he do possess in you mother in you 
of which I be more proud to be the donor 
then if the absolute rule of all the world 
be offer to this hand once more you be welcome 
which with all ceremony due to greatness 
I will make know but that our just revenge 
admit not of delay your hand lord general 

your favour and his merit I may say 
have make he such but I be jealous how 
your subject will receive it 

how my subject 
what do you make of i o heaven my subject 
how base shall I esteem the name of prince 
if that poor dust be any thing before 
the whirlwind of my absolute command 
let they be happy and rest so content 
they pay the tribute of their heart and knee 
to such a prince that not alone he have power 
to keep his own but to increase it that 
although he have a body may add to 
the fame night labour of strong Hercules 
yet be the master of a continence 
that so can temper it that I forbear 
their daughter and their wife who hand though strong 
as yet have never draw by unjust mean 
their proper wealth into my treasury 
but I grow glorious and let they beware 
that in their least repine at my pleasure 
they change not a mild prince for if provoke 
I dare and will be so into a tyrant 

you see there be hope that we shall rule again 
and your fall fortune rise 

I hope your highness 
be please that I shall still hold my place with you 
for I have be so long use to provide you 
fresh bit of flesh since i grow stale that sure 
if cashier now I shall prove a bad cator 
in the fishmarket of cold chastity 

for i I be your own nor since I first 
know what it be to serve you have remember 
I have a soul but such a one who essence 
depend whole on your highness pleasure 
and therefore madam 

rest assure you be 
such instrument we must not lose 

our service 

you have view they then what be your opinion of they 
in this dull time of peace we have prepare they 
apt for the war ha 

sir they have limb 
that promise strength sufficient and rich armour 
the soldier best love wealth more it appear 
they have be drill nay very pretty drill 
for many of they can discharge their musket 
without the danger of throw off their head 
or be offensive to the stander by 
by sweat too much backward nay I find 
they know the right and left hand file and may 
with some impulsion no doubt be bring 
to pass the A b c of war and come 
unto the hornbook 

well that care be you 
and see that you effect it 

I be slow 
to promise much but if within ten day 
by precept and example not draw from 
worm eat precedent of the roman war 
but from my own I make they not transcend 
all that ever yet bear arm let it be say 
Protaldy brag which will be unto i 
as hateful as to be esteem a coward 
for sir few captain know the way to win he 
and make the soldier valiant you shall seem 
lie with they in their trench talk and drink 
and be together drink and what seem stranger 
we will sometime wench together which once practise 
and with some other care and hide act 
they be all make i I will breathe into they 
such fearless resolution and such fervour 
that though I bring they to besiege a fort 
who wall be steeple high and cannon proof 
not to be undermine they shall fly up 
like swallow and the parapet once win 
for proof of their obedience if I will they 
they shall leap down again and what be more 
by some direction they shall have from i 
not break their neck 

this be above belief 

sir on my knowledge though he have speak much 
he be able to do more 

she mean on she 

and howsoever in his thankfulness 
for some few favor do he by myself 
he leave Austrachia not Theodoret 
though he be chief aim at can have lay 
with all his dukedom power that shame upon he 
which in his barbarous malice to my honour 
he swear with threat to effect 

I can but 
believe you madam thou be one degree 
grow near to my heart and I be proud 
to have in thou so glorious a plant 
transport hither in thy conduct we 
go on assure of conquest our remove 
shall be with the next sun 

amazement leave i it be he 

we be again undo 

our guilt have no assurance nor defence 

if now your ever ready wit fail to protect we 
we shall be all discoverde 

be not so 
in your amazement and your foolish fear 
I be prepare for it 

how not one poor welcome 
in answer of so long a journey make 
only to see your brother 

I have stand 
silent thus long and be yet unresolved 
whether to entertain thou on my sword 
as fit a parricide of a mother honour 
or whether be a prince I yet stand bind 
though thou be here condemn to give thou hear 
before I execute what foolish hope 
nay pray you forbear or desperate madness rather 
unless thou come assure I stand in debt 
as far to all impiety as thyself 
have make thou bring thy neck unto the axe 
since look only here it can but 
draw fresh blood from thy sear up conscience 
to make thou sensible of that horror which 
they ever bear about they that like Nero 
like say I thou be worse since thou dare strive 
in her defame to murder thy alive 

that she that long since have the boldness to 
be a bad woman though I wish some other 
shall so report she can not want the cunning 
since they go hand in hand to lay fair colour 
on her black crime I be resolve before 
nor make I doubt but that she have empoison 
your good opinion of i and so far 
incense your rage against i that too late 
I come to plead my innocence 

to excuse thy impious scandal rather 

Rather force with fear to be compel to come 

forbear 

This move not i and yet have I not be 
transport on my own integrity 
I neither be so odious to my subject 
nor yet so barren of defence but that 
by force I can have justify my guilt 
have I be faulty but since innocence 
be to itself a hundred thousand guard 
and that there be no son but though he owe 
that name to a ill mother but stand bind 
rather to take away with his own danger 
from the number of her fault then for his own 
security to add unto they This 
this have make i to prevent the expense 
of blood on both side the injury the rape 
page that ever wait upon the war 
the account of all which since you be the cause 
believe it will have be require from you 
rather I say to offer up my daughter 
who live only can revenge my death 
with my heart blood a sacrifice to your anger 
then that you shall draw on your head more curse 
than yet you have deserve 

I do begin 
to feel a alteration in my nature 
and in his full sail confidence a shower 
of gentle rain that fall on the fire 
of my hot rage have quench it ha I will 
once more speak rough to he and I will 
yet there be something whisper to i that 
I have say too much how be my heart divide 
between the duty of a son and love 
due to a brother yet I be sway here 
and must ask of you how it be possible 
you can affect i that have learn to hate 
where you shall pay all love 

which join with duty 
upon my knee I shall be proud to tender 
have she not use herself so many sword 
to cut those bond that tide i to it 

fie no more of that 

Alas it be a theme 
I take no pleasure to discourse of will 
it can assoon be bury to the world 
as it shall die to i nay more I wish 
next to my part of heaven that she will spend 
the last part of her life so here that all 
indifferent judge may condemn i for 
a most malicious slanderer nay texde it 
upon my forehead if you hate i mother 
put i to such a shame pray you do believe it 
there be no glory that may fall upon i 
can equal the delight I shall receive 
in that disgrace provide the repeal 
of your long banish virtue and good name 
usher i to it 

see she show herself 
a easy mother which her tear confirm 

it be a good sign the comfortable rain 
I ever see 

embrace why this be well 
may never more but love in you and duty 
on your part rise between you 

do you hear lord general 
do not your new stamp honour on the sudden 
begin to grow sick 

yes I find it fit 
that put off my armour I shall think of 
some honest hospital to retire to

they can whip i for it what be your opinion 

the beadle will resolve you for I can 
there be something that more near concern myself 
that call upon i 

note but yonder scarab 
that live upon the dung of her base pleasure 
how from the fear that she may yet prove honest 
hang down their wicked head 

what be that to i

or fear make he forbear to execute 
the vengeance he determine his fond pity

best lady 
we have no faculty which be not you 

nor will be anything without you 

be so 
and we will stand or fall together for 
since we have go so far that death must stay 
the journey which we wish shall never end

I will I have 
a convoy too to bring i safe off 
for rage although it be allay with sorrow 
appear so dreadful in he that I shake 
to look upon it 

coward I will meet it 
and know from whence it have birth son kingly Thierry

and thrive so well here that the god endeavour 
to practice it above 

your mother 

ha or be they only careful to revenge 
not to reward or when for your offence 
we study satisfaction must the cure 
be worse than the disease 

will you not hear i 

to lose the ability to perform those duty 
for which I entertain the name of husband 
ask more than common sorrow but to impose 
for the redress of that defect a torture 
in mark she to death for who alone 
I feel that weakness as a want require 
more than the make the head bald or fall 
thus flat upon the earth or curse that way 
or pray this o such a scene of grief 
and so set down the world the stage to act on 
may challenge a tragedian better practise 
than I be to express it for my cause

so weak that though the part be good I fear 
the ill act of it will defraud it of 
the poor reward it may deserve man pity

you dare you again 
though arm with the authority of a mother 
attempt the danger that will fall on you 
if such another syllable awake it 
go and with you be safe I have such cause 
of grief nay more to love it that I will not

but take away from that have from i 
prompt by your last part groan inquire 
what draw it from you and the cause soon learn 
for she who barbarism can deny nothing 
with such prevail earnestness desire it 
it be not in i though it have be my death 
to hide it from she she I say in who 
all be that Athens Rome or warlike Sparta 
have register for good in their best woman 
but nothing of their ill know herself 
mark out I know not by what power but sure 
a cruel one to die to give you child 
have first with a settle countenance 
look up to heaven and then upon herself 
it be the next best object and then smile 
as if her joy in death to do you service 
will break forth in despite of the much sorrow 
she show she have to leave you and then take 
i by the hand this hand which I must ever 
love better than I have do since she touch it 
go say she to my lord and to go to he 
be such a happiness I must not hope for 
and tell he that he too much prize a trifle 
make only worthy in his love and her 
thankful acceptance for her sake to rob 
the orphan kingdom of such guardian as 
must of necessity descend from he 
and therefore in some part of recompense 
of his much love and to show to the world 
that it be not her fault only but her fate 
that do deny to let she be the mother 
of such most certain blessing yet for proof 
she do not envy she that happy she 
that be appoint to they her quick end 
shall make way for she which no soon speak 
but in a moment this too ready engine 
make such a battery in the choice castle 
that ever nature make to defend life 
that straight it shake and sink 

stay dare any 
presume to shed a tear before i or 
ascribe that worth unto themselves to merit 
to do so for she I have do now on 

fall thus once more she smile as if that death 
for she have study a new way to sever 
the soul and body without sense of pain 
and then tell he quoth she what you have see 
and with what willingness it be do for which 
my last request unto he be that he 
will instant make choice of one most happy 
in be so choose to supply my place 
by who if heaven bless he with a daughter 
in my remembrance let it bear my name 
which say she die 

I hear this and yet live

she be dead and what her entertainment may be 
in the other world without i be uncertain 
and dare I stay here unresolved

so low that I have lose the power to be 
disposer of my own life
