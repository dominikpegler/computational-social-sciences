master substitute then why shall he 
usurp a privilege without your loave 
to preach unto the people a doctrine 
they ought not hear 
he incite they not to obey your charge

your counsel 

it be this my lord 
that straight before the french have pitch their tent 
or raise a work before our city wall 
as yet their ship have not over spread the sea 
we send a regiment that they with speed 
land on the marsh and begird their back 
while we open our gate and with astrong assault 
force they retreat into the arch of death 
so the revengeful earth shall be their tomb 
that do ere while trample her teem womb

to abuse a man of so much merit be not 
seemly in you nay I will term it sauciness

of a counsellor and will object 
This my prophetic fear whisper my heart 
when from a watch tower I behold the french 
erect their spear which like a mighty grove

the sun like diamond or as the glorious 
guilder of the day shall deign a low visit 
than my warm blood that use to play like 
summer feel a change graybearded winter
