sweet shepherd for Oenone sake be cunning in this song 
and keep thy love and love thy choice or else thou do she wrong 

my vow be make and witness the poplar will not start 
nor shall the nymph Oenone love from forth my breathe heart 
I will go bring the one thy way my flock be here behind 
and I will have a lover fee they say unkissed unkind 

but pray you tell i Juno be it so 
as Pallas tell i here the tale of Echo 

Shee be a nymph indeed as Pallas tell 
a walker such as in these thicket dwell 
and as she tell what subtle juggle prank 
she play with Juno so she tell her thank 
a tattle trull to come at every call 
and now forsooth nor tongue nor life at all 
and though perhaps she be a help to jove 
and hold i chat while he may court his love 
believe i dame I be of this opinion 
he take but little pleasure in the minion 
and whatsoever his escape have be beside 
dare say for he a never stray so wide 
a lovely nutbrown lass or lusty trull 
have power perhaps to make a god a bull 

gramercy gentle Juno for that jest 
i'faith that item be worth all the rest 

no matter Venus howsoever you scorn 
my father jove at that time wear the horn 

have every wanton god above Venus not better luck 
than heaven will be a pleasant park and mar a lusty buck 

tut Mars have horn to butt withal although no bull a show 
a never need to mask in net he fear no jealous froe 

forsooth the better be his turn for if he speak too loud 
must find some shift to shadow he a net or else a cloud 

no more of this fair goddess unrip not so your shame 
to stand all naked to the world that be such heavenly dame 

nay Pallas that be a common trick with Venus well we know 
and all the god in heaven have see her naked long ago 

and then she be so fair and bright and lovely and so trim 
as Mars be but for Venus tooth and she will sport with he 
and but i list not here to make comparison with jove 
Mars be no ranger Juno he in every open grove 

too much of this we wander far the sky begin to scowl 
retire we to Diana bower the weather will be foul 

Pallas the storm be past and go and Phoebus clear the sky 
and lo behold a ball of gold a fair and worthy prize 

this posy will the apple to the fair give be 
then be it i for Venus hight the fair of the three 

the fair here as fair be mean be I you do i wrong 
and if the fair have it must to i it do belong 

then Juno may it not enjoy so every one say not 
but I will prove myself the fair ere I lose it so 
the brief be this  
let this unto the fair give tree 
the fair of the three and I be she 
detur pulche  
the fair  
detur pulcherrimae  
the fair of the three and I be 〈◊〉 

my face be fair  
that all the god in heaven  
have make they choose I of the 〈◊〉 
to be the wife of Jove and queen of heaven 
Y● then this prize be  to beauty 
the only she that win this prize be I 

that Venus be the fair this do prove 
that Venus be the lovely queen of love 
the name of Venus be in deed but beauty 
and man i fair call per excellency 
if then this prize be but bequeath to beauty 
the only she that win this prize be I 

to stand on term of beauty as you take it 
believe i lady be but to mistake it 
the beauty that this subtle prize must win 
no outward beauty hight but dwell within 
and sift it as you please and you shall find 
this beauty be the beauty of the mind 
this fairness virtue hight in general 
that many branch have in special 
this beauty wisdom hight whereof be I 
by heaven appoint goddess worthy 
and look how much the mind the better part 
do overpass the body in desert 
so much the mistress of those gift divine 
excel thy beauty and that state of thou 
then if this prize be thus bequeath to beauty 
the only she that win this prize be I 

nay Pallas by your leave you wander clean 
we must not construe hereof as you mean 
but take the sense as it be plain mean 
and let the fair hate I be content 

our reason will be infinite I trow 
unless unto some other point we grow 
for first here be none methinks dispose to yield 
and none but will with word maintain the field 

then if you will to avoid a tedious grudge 
refer it to the sentence of judge 
who ere he be that come next in place 
let he bestow the ball and end the case 

so can it not go wrong with i not at all 

I be agree however it befall 
and yet by common doom so may it be 
I may be say the fair of the three 

then yonder lo that shepherd swain be he 
that must be 〈◊〉 in this controversy 

Juno in happy time I do accept the man 
it seem by his look some skill of love he can 

the nymph be go and I all solitary 
must wend to tend my charge oppress with melancholy 
this day or else i fail my shepherd skill 
will tide i pass good or pass ill 

shepherd abash not though at sudden thus 
thou be arrive by ignorance among we 
not earthly but divine and goddess all three 
Iuno Pallas Venus these our title be 
nor fear to speak for reverence of the place 
choose to end a hard and doubtful case 
this apple lo nor ask thou whence it come 
be to be give unto the fair dame 
and fair be nor she nor she but she 
who shepherd thou shall fair name to be 
this be thy charge fulfil without offence 
and she that win shall give thou recompense 

Dread not to speak for we have choose thou 
sith in this case we can no judge be 

And shepherd say that I the fair am 
and thou shall win good guerdon for the same 

nay shepherd look upon my state grace 
because the pomp that long to  
they may not see and think queen Juno name 
to who old shepherd title work of fame 
be mighty and may easy suffice 
at Phoebus hand to game a golden prize 
and for thy meed since I be queen of riches 
shepherd I will reward thou with great monarchy 
empire and kingdom heap of massy gold 
sceptre and diadem curious to behold 
rich robe of sumptuous workmanship and cost 
and thousand thing whereof I make no boast 
the mould whereon thou tread shall be of Tagus sand 
and Xanthus shall run liquid gold for thou to wash thy hand 
and if thou like to tend thy flock and not from they to she 
their fleece shall be curl gold to please their master eye 
and last to set thy heart one fire give this one fruit to i 
and shepherd lo this tree of gold will I bestow on thou 
the ground whereon it grow the grass the root of gold 
the body and the bark of gold all glitter to behold 
the leaf of burnish gold the fruit that thereon grow 
be diadem set with pearl in gold in gorgeous glister show 
and if this tree of gold in lieu may not suffice 
require a grove of golden tree so Juno bear the prize 

i l●st not tempt thou with decaying wealth 
which be e●ba●et by want of lusty health 
but if thou have a mind to fly above 
you crown with fame near to the seat of jove 
if thou aspire to wisdom worthiness 
whereof thou may not see the brightness 
if thou desire honour of chivalry 
to be renown for happy victory 
to fight it out and in the champain field 
to shroud thou under Pallas warlike shield 
to prance on barb steed this honour lo 
myself for guerdon shall on thou bestow 
and for encouragement that thou may see 
what famous knight dame Pallas warrior be 
behold in Pallas honour here they come 
march along with find of thunder drum 

Come shepherd come sweet shepherd look on i 
these be to hot alarams these for thou 
but if thou will give i the golden ball 
Cupid my boy shall hate to play withal 
that whensoever this apple he shall see 
the god of love himself shall think on thou 
and bid thou look and choose and he will wound 
whereso thy fancy object shall be find 
and light when he shoot he do not miss 
and I will give the many lovely kiss 
and come and play with thou on Ida here 
and if thou will a face that have no peer 
a gallant girl a lusty minion trull 
that can give sport to thou thy bellyful 
to ravish all thy beat vein with joy

most heavenly dame be never man as I 
poor shepherd swain so happy and unhappy 
the least of these delight that you devise 
able to wrap and dazzle human eye 
but since my silence may not pardon be 
and I appoint which be the fair she

by Paris doom must have this golden ball 
thy beauty stately Iuno dame divine 
that like to Phoebus golden beam do shine

who sweetness do both god and creator move 
and if the fair face deserve the ball

and in this ball do Venus more delight 
then in her lovely boy fair Cupid sight 
Come shepherd comme sweet Venus be thy friend

Colin and kind have be thy friend that Cupid can not see 

and whither wend you thriveless swain like to the strike deer

yet will Rhamnusia vengeance take on her disdainful fault 

Lo yonder co●●es the lovely nymph that in these Ida vale

beguile disdain and out of love live long thou poplartree 
and let thy letter grow in length to witness this with i 
a Venus but for reverence unto thy sacred name 
to steal a silly maiden love I may account it blame 
and if the tale be true I hear and blush for to receit 
thou do i wrong to leave the plain and dally out of sight 
false Paris this be not thy vow when thou and I be one 
to range and change old love for new but now those day be go 
but I will find the goddess out that she thy vow may read 
and fill these wood with my lament for thy unhappy deed 

so fair a face so foul a thought to harbour in his breast 
thy hope consume poor nymph thy hap be worse than all the rest 

a shepherd you be full of wile and whet your wit on book 
and wrap poor maid with pipe and song and sweet allure look 

misspeak not all for his amiss there be that keep flock 
that never choose but once nor yet beguile love with mock

Melponie the muse of tragic song 
with mournful tune in stole of dismal hue 
assist a silly nymph to wail her woe 
and leave thy lusty company behind

but Bacchus time well spend I wot our sacred father jove 
with Phoebus and the god of war be meet in Diane grove 

then we be here before they yet but stay the earth do swell 
God Neptune to this hap be good do meet the prince of hell 

what jar be these that call the god of heaven and hell below 

it be a work of wit and toil to rule a lusty shrew 

bring forth the man of Troie that he may hear 
whereof he be to be arraign here 

Lo where he come prepare to plead his case 
under conduct of lovely Venus grace 

I have not see a more allure boy 

so beauty hight the wrack of Priam Troy 

lo● sacred jove at Juno proud complain 
as erst I give my pledge to Mercury 
I bring the man who he do late attaint 
to answer his indictment orderly 
and crave this grace of this immortal senate 
that you allow the man his advocate 

that may not be the law of heaven deny 
a man to plead or answer by attorney 

Pallas thy doom be all too peremptory 

Venus that favour be deny he flat 
he be a man and therefore by out law 
himself without his aid must plead his cause 

then bash not shepherd in so good a case 
and friend thou have as well as foe in place 

why Mercury why do you not indite he 

soft gentle Juno I pray you do not bite he 

nay god I trow you be like to have great silence 
unless this parrot be command hence 

Venus forbear be still speak Mercury 

if Juno jangle Venus will reply 

Paris king Priam son thou be arraign of partiality 
of sentence partial and unjust for that without indifferency 
beyond desert or merit far as thy accuser say 
from they to lady Venus here thou give the prize away 
what be thy answer 
sacred and just thou great and dreadful jove 
and you thrice reverend power who love nor hate 
may wrest awry if this to i a man 
this fortune fatal be that I must plead 
for safe excusal of my guiltless thought 
the honour more make my mishap the less 
that I a man must plead before the god 
gracious forbearer of the world amiss 
for she who beauty how it have entice 
this heavenly senate may with i aver 
but sith nor that nor this may do i boot 
and for myself myself must speaker be 
a mortal man amid this heavenly presence 
let i not shape a long defence to they 
that ben beholder of my guiltless thought 
then for the deed that I may not deny 
wherein consist the full of my offence 
I do upon command if then I err 
I do no more than to a man belong 
and if in verdict of their form divine 
my dazzle eye do swerve or surfeit more 
on Juno face than any face of their● 
it be no partial fault but fault of he 
belike who eyesight not so perfect be 
as may decern the brightness of toe rest 
and if it be permit unto man 
you god to parley with your secret thought 
there be that sit upon that sacred seat 
that will with Paris err in Venus praise 
but let i cease to speak of error here 
sith what my hand the organ of my heart 
do give with good agreement of my eye 
my tongue be void with process to maintain 

a jolly shepherd wise and eloquent 

First then arraign of partiality 
Paris reply unguilty of the fact 
his reason be because he know no more 
fair Venus ceston than dame Juno mace 
nor never see wise Pallas crystal shield 
then as I look I love and like atonce 
and as it be refer from they to i 
to give the prize to she who beauty best 
my fancy do commend so do I praise 
and judge as may my dazzle eye decern 

a piece of art that cunning pardie 
refer the blame to weakness of his eye 

now for I must add reason for my deed 
why Venus rather please i of the three 
f●●st in the entrails of my mortal ear 
the question stand upon beauty blaze 
the name of her that height the queen of love 
my thought in beauty shall not be excel 
have it be destine to majesty 
yet will I not rob Venus of her grace 
then stately Juno may have bear the ball 
have it to wisdom be entitle 
my human wit have give it Pallas then 
but sith unto the fair of the three 
that power that throw it for my father ill 
do dedicate this ball and safe dare 
my shepherd skill adventure as I think 
to judge of form and beauty rather than 
of Juno state or Pallas worthiness 
that learn to ken the fair of the flock 
and praise beauty but by nature aim 
behold to Venus Paris give this fruit 
a dayman choose there by full consent 
and heavenly power shall not repent their deed 
where it be say beyond desert of she 
I honour Venus with this golden prize 
you god alas what can a mortal man 
decern betwixt the sacred gift of heaven 
or if I may with reverence reason thus 
suppose I give and judge corrupt then 
for hope of that that best do please my thought 
this apple not for beauty praise alone 
I may offend sith I be pardon 
and tempt more than ever creature be 
with wealth with beauty and with chivalry 
and so prefer beauty before they all 
the thing that have enchant heaven itself 
and for the one contentment be my wealth 
a shell of salt will serve a shepherd swain 
a slender banquet in a homely skrip 
and water run from the silver spring 
for arm they dread no foe that sit so low 
a thorn can keep the wind from off my back 
a sheepcoat thatch a shepherd palace hight 
of tragic muse shepherd ●on no skill 
enough be they if Cupid be displease 
to sing his praise on slender oaten pipe 
and thus thrice reverend have I tell my tale 
and crave the torment of my guiltless soul 
to be measure by my faultless thought 
if warlike Pallas or the queen of heaven 
sue to reverse my sentence by appeal 
be it as please your majesty divine 
the wrong the hurt not i if any be 
but she who beauty claim the prize of i 

Venus withdraw your shepherd for a space 
till he again be call for into place 
Juno what will you after this reply 
but doom with sentence of indifferency 
and if you will but justice in the cause 
the man must quite be by heaven law 

yea gentle jove when Juno suit be move 
then heaven may see how well she be belove 

but madam fit it majesty divine 
in any sort from justice to decline 

whether the man be guilty yea or no 
that do not hinder our appeal I trow 

Phoebus I wot amid this heavenly crew 
there be that have to say as well as you 

and Juno I with they and they with i 
in law and right must needful agree 

I grant you may agree but be content 
to doubt upon regard of your agreement 

and if you mark the man in his defence 
say thereof as a might with reverence 

and do you very well I promise you 

no doubt sir you can note it cunning 

well Juno if you will appeal you may 
but first dispatch the shepherd hence away 

then Vulcan dame be like to have the wrong 

and that in passion do to Mars belong 

call Venus and the shepherd in again 

And ride the man that he may know his pain 

his pain his pain his never die pain 
a cause to make to many more complain 

shepherd thou have be hard with equity and law 
and for thy star do thou to other calling draw 
we here dismiss thou hence by order of our senate 
go take thy way to Troie and there abide thy fate 

sweet shepherd with such luck in love while thou do live 
as may the queen of love to any lover give 

my luck be loss however my love do speed 
I fear i Paris shall but rue his deed 

from Ida wood now wend the shepherd boy 
that in his bosom carry fire to Troy 

Venus these lady do appeal you see 
and that they may appeal the god agree 
it rest then that you be well content 
to stand in this unto our final judgement 
and if king Priam son do well in this 
the law of heaven will not lead amiss 

but sacred jupiter may thy daughter choose 
she may with reason this appeal refuse 
yet if they be unmoved in their shame 
be it a stain and blemish to their name 
a deed to far unworthy of the place 
unworthy Pallas lance or Juno mace 
and if to beauty it bequeath be 
I doubt not but it will return to i 

Venus there be no more ado than so 
it rest where the god do it bestow 

but lady under favour of your rage 
however it be you play upon the vantage 

then dame that we more free may debate 
and here the indifferent sentence of this senate 
withdraw you from this presence for a space 
till we have thorough question of the cac● 
Diana shall be your guide nor shall you need 
yourselves to inquire how thing do here succeed 
we will as we resolve give you to know 
by general doom how every thing do go 

thy will my wish fair lady will you wend 

beshrew she who this sentence do offend 

now jove be just and god you that be Venus friend 
if you have ever do she wrong then may you make amends 

Venus be fair Pallas and Juno toe 

but tell i now without some more ado 
who be the fair she and do not flatter 

Vulcan upon comparison hang all the matter 
that do the quarrel and the strife be end 

because it be know the quarrel be pretend 

Mars you have reason for your speech perdie 
my dame I trow be fair in your eye 

or Vulcan I shall do she double wrong 

about a toy we tarry here so long 
give it by voice voice give the odds 
a trifle so to to trouble all the god 

believe i Saturn be it so for i 

for i Pluto for i mar for i if jove agree 

and gentle god I be indifferent 
but then I know who be likely to be shend 

thrice reverend god and thou immortal jove 
if Phoebus may as he do much behove 
be license accord to our law 
to speak upright in this doubt cause 
since woman wit work man unceasing woe 
to make they friend that now be friendless foe 
and peace to keep with they with we and all 
that make their title to this golden ball 
nor think you god my speech do derogate 
from sacred power of this immortal senate 
refer this sentence where it do belong 
in this say I fair Phoebe have the wrong 
not that I mean her beauty bear the prize 
but that the holly law of heaven deny 
one god to meddle in another power 
and this befall so near Diana bower 
as for the appease this unpleasant grudge 
in my conceit she hight the fit judge 
if jove control not Pluto hell with charm 
if Mars have sovereign power to manage arm 
if Bacchus bear no rule in Neptune sea 
nor Vulcan fire do Saturn since obey 
suppress not then against law and equity 
Diana power in her own territory 
who regiment amid her sacred bower 
as proper height as any rule of you 
well may we so wipe all the speech away 
that Pallas Juno Venus have to say 
and answer that by justice of our law 
we be not suffer to conclude the cause 
and this to i most equal doom appear 
a woman to be judge among her fere 

Apollo have find out the only mean 
to rid the blame from we and trouble clean 

we be behold to his sacred wit 

I can commend and well allow of it 
and so derive the matter from we all 
that Diana have the give of the ball 

so jove may clear excuse he in the case 
where Juno else will chide and brawl apace 

and now it be some cunning to divine 
to who Diana will this prize resign 

suffice i it shall be none of i 

Vulcan though thou be black thou be nothing fine 

go bathe thou Bacchus in a tub of wine 
the ball as likely to be i as thou 

Lo lady far beyond my hope and will you see 
this thankless office be impose to i 
wherein if you will rest aswell content 
as Diana will be judge indifferent 
my equal doom shall none of you offend 
and of this quarrel make a final end 
and therefore whether you belief of loath 
confirm your promise with some sacred oath 

Phoebe chief mistress of this sylvan chase 
who god have choose to conclude the case 
that yet in balance undecided lie 
touch bestow of this golden prize 
I give my promise and my oath withal 
by S●ix by heaven power imperial 
by all that long to Pallas deity

unpartial her wisdom shall bestow 
without mislike or quarrel any more

and say the best desert do there abide 

and here I promise and protest withal 
by Styx by heaven power imperial 
by all that long to Juno deity

and by that holy name of Proserpina 
that wheresoever this ball of pure gold 
that chaste Diana here in hand do hold 
unpartial her wisdom shall bestow 
without mislike o● quarrel any more 
Juno shall rest content and satisfy 
and say the best desert do there abide 

and lovely Phoebe for I know thy doom 
will be no other than shall thou become 
behold I take thy dainty hand to kiss 
and with my solemn oath confirm my promise 
by Styx by jove immortal empery 
by Cupid bow by Venus myrtletree 
by Vulcan gift my ceston and my fan 
by this red rose who colour first begin 
when erst my wanton boy the more his blame 
do draw his bow awry and hurt his dame 
by all the honour and the sacrifice 
that from Cithaeron and from Paphos rise 
that wheresoever etc 
Venus shall rest etc 

it be enough and goddess attend 
there won within these pleasant shady wood 
where neither storm nor sun distemperature 
have power to hurt by cruel heat or cold 
under the climate of the mild heaven 
where seldom light jove angry thunderbolt 
for favour of that sovereign earthly peer 
where whistle wind make music among the tree 
far from disturbance of our country god 
amid the cypress springe a gracious nymph

and vow her life with favour to prolong 
then first begin Cupid eyesight wax dim
