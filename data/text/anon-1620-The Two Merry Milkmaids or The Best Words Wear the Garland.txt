that burst and shed their poison not a flower 
but bear a sting in it that wound my heart 
foul lust and murder that do follow it 
lie hide among the leave o throw i sir 
throw i from your embrace as far as the wild wind 
do drive the dust before it and destroy i 
like it to nothing purge your land by make 
bonfire of it and i upon some hill 
that the black smoke may vanish into air 
and not infect your turret 

why do thou talk thus 

first kill i sir it will be charity 
then rip my bosom up and in my heart 
there you shall find what my tongue loathe to utter 

I think dear Dorigene I never shall 
have be a stranger to your thought till now

although I never give he any hope 
upon the wedding day he meet i here 
and look so like a man that mean to perish 
that I be willing to restore some comfort 
whereon I wish he get i such a garland 
make of all flower that the world contain 
not think such a thing can have be do 
and for requital promise he I can 
utter no more nor shall have think so much

all will you more will you we shall proceed 
Grow impudent in sin till thunder rent we 

why but such promise may be dispense with 
though you have seal it with a vow 

I do sir and a great one nor leave there 
but add two or three to that the least be 
the blast of this beauty he adore 

I know not how to doubt yet this may be 
a cunning I will try she let it not trouble thou 
dear Dorigene thou shall perform thy vow 
I will be the sufferer and take the sin on i 

but the damnation must be i my lord 
and if I pull it on i it shall be this way 
Rather then wrong you 

why so thou wrong i worst 
and will deprive i of all the joy in this world 
thou will teach i by ill example how to follow thou 
sweet let i kiss thou I will beg for that 
which all man else do labour to avoid 
it be but one hour loss of thou I prithee 
make no more scruple of it then other woman 
it be a crime that not one night in the year 
but somewhere or other such a fault be make 
nor look the wife the next day worse for it 

no more sir 

thou will consent 

I will 

why I thank thou I have bestow some pain to beg myself into a order o Dorigene if thou be false the serpent part with his subtlety and close it in the fruit he give thy sex 

I know not whether I be great bless 
or curse in such a husband fate thou have thy end 
and I have i Come Dorilus and take i 
now while I have obedience 
give i not respite to enter into consideration 
lest I do worse then perform my vow 
he come welcome my Dorilus be merry man 
and look upon i as a lover shall 
that have obtain his mistress I be thou 
and for the time free as I be the duke 
be bold man in approach there be no fear 
of spy upon we we be free as people 
that know no law or do command the law 
I have the duke consent for what I do 
nay his entreaty he do like to have 
a rival in the thing he love and be 
not different from the common sort of man 
that do esteem they most that most abuse they 

how many way do you desire to kill i 

why Dorilus 

you say the duke be acquaint 

with our love it be true 
but there be no harm in that for he will be secret 
as I have life he will 

why do you abuse i thus 

I do for as I have a soul I be serious 
he bid i keep my vow and say the man 
that do bestow this garland do deserve 

what to enjoy you 

ay to enjoy i 

he do it then to give we leave to sin 
that he may punish 

o no he do it for my quiet he will soon 
strike his own eye to offend it nay his heart 
rather than my 

what do we then contrive lust together 
that rebel blood which rage against he 
have better be bestow upon rude beast 
wild than wolf or tiger we be worse 
they that will wrong this true royal prince 
this prince of his own passion as of man 
deserve to see no day to taste no food 
no clothes to shield he from the rage of winter 
but live more wretched than the last of beggar 
die without tear or prayer and want a grave 
take your vow back again and place they better 
for here I make a general release 
of all debt betwixt we be a free woman 
and set up anew with caution that you never 
prove bankrupt again deal not so large 
nor trust so prodigal lest you do meet 
with such as will take the full forfeiture 
so virtue guard you and your goodness crown 
your thought and action with true chastity 

this be not as I look for nor do wish 

o stay let i not be so wretched but to pay 
the alm of a true heart thanks for your bounty 
which have be great than I can requite 
now I do love thou Dorilus as dear 
as thy own mistress virtue and I beseech thou 
deprive we not thy presence at the court 
for I will live to study a requital 
and the duke with i that shall know thy worth 
and find it in thy deed shall entertain thou 
and in his bosom fix thou a true friend 
thou shall not go unless thou promise i 
I may receive and welcome thou at court 

since you command i I will not fail to offer 
my service to my sovereign and you 

with tear of joy I love thou 

what blood have these two creature cold as I be

and I do feel it work towards my heart 
which when it once have reach and kindle 
into a flame no premeditation 
of the offence shall blow it out again 
the duke have entertain a jealousy 
and employ i in the discovery 
which make effectual to my purpose 
mischief be brood in my brain and the event 
shall work my pleasure or their discontent

I be uncapable of this ill language 
but suppose I be my lord as you esteem i 
be this a time when my heart be full of sorrow

he weep out in water the sun burn 
not outward as my blood within passion beat 
so thick and short they make my entrails sweat

her dwell in that face it be a question 
whether smile more adorn that cheek then tear

it be the mad world the report go she ●hud lie with on for a nosegay 

in some thing fame will be free I see in some thing scant for I will assure you it be for a garland 

why a garland let it be she have be better win it with some other dance then the old one but she have hard measure methinks not to be allow a advocate for alas what can a woman say for herself in such a case 

do thou think a advocate can handle it better 

yes if he have a feel of the business 

away traitor 

bring forth the prisoner place she at the bar 

read the indictment 

Dorigen Ebroistene daughter to guide ebroisten in the province of Mysen gentleman and by the grace and favour of our sovereign lord duke of Saxony make duchess attaint of high treason by commit adultery with one Dorilus Truohesse a private gentleman of the same province of Mysen who by good and sufficient witness beside her own shameless confession to the duke himself be here just accuse and indict of the fact yet the duke out of his most gracious clemency desirous of a direct and lawful proceed admit the say dorigen daughter to the aforesaid Guido to answer for herself and wish with all his soul such be his infinite affection to she that she can clear herself of the crime so heaven and the justice of her cause defend she 

speak lady free and fearless what can you say 

nothing but that I do desire to die 
for it be sin enough that the duke think 
I be guilty of the fact all the clemency 
that you can show i or I do desire 
be to condemn i quick 

that I must speak it grieve i in a cause 
which I cud wish never have presidence 
as it have have too often alas that I 
who do bleed inward to behold this woman 
fall by a sin equal to Lucifer 
from her clear heaven where she stand a star 
move in his arm as her proper orb 
that I shall see this woman as I say 
who have she be a fix one have never 
shoot from her sphere but as a exhalation 
draw by the attractive virtue of the sun 
appear a glorious star yet want matter 
to maintain his lustre shoot forth his flame 
and drop from whence it come unto a dunghill 
so be this woman raise and so she fall 
that so much beauty which be give for honour 
and do advance she to it shall cause shame 
who can tell whether this be the first man 
that she have sin withal since usual 
many fault be commit ere one find 
she promise the fellow of her lust 
upon condition to make that and what be it 
a garland a garland of all flower 
of what effect who know or to what purpose 
both be as certain as the thing itself 
how or from whence it come nay more than this 
she be so impudent to tell the duke 
and tell he she have swear which the immodest 
and most profess strumpet never will 
what name of shame be to be give this woman 
that will thus lewd suffer the wild tongue 
prcoclaim performance of so vild a deed 
and unto he she know do love she so 
she may perhaps by her beauty and her tear 
or both together stir compassion 
in many here and in the duke himself 
but when her crime shall be remember 
a crime so beyond mercy be do 
unto a prince and such a prince as he be 
what can I less inspire i all you power 
that think i worthy of authority 
then without pity to condemn this woman 

the case be too apparent 

be it not grave father 

yes indeed it be I be almost asleep 

you all do know all you that know the law 
who pardon the offender do commit 
a offence equal with he that do punish 
the harmless innocent than she must die 
I grieve to speak it and be so charitable 
to wish that her reproach may die with she 

I thank thou for the last speech it be well 
oh that she now cud speak and clear herself 
but proceed give sentence if she stay long 
and I stand by a witness of her tear 
she will weep herself guiltless and innocent 
therefore go on 

stay 

who be that 

I know not 

whence come that voice 

out of the cloud I think 
for no man dare own it 

go forward and give sentence 

stay I say 

it speak again 

it come by my ear 

the court be trouble 

hear i you minister of justice 
and thou patron of it and truth 
that come to you for succour and for safety 

keep your place for let it be the devil 
I will hear he and hear shall determine 
whether he be a spirit of truth or lie 

the all preserver that guard innocence 
and often let it pine but never perish 
can raise a voice from stone or tree or wind 
to plead the cause that need no eloquence 
what have this lady do that here you bring she 
unto a bar of shame it be it for be virtuous 
because she have be constant to her lord 
but some have call her chastity in question 
that never have a spark in their own breast 
and have possess the duke from his own thought 
that she must needs be bad because they be so 
have every woman so much wit to hide 
that fault especial and have not she 
who be the mirror of of her sex for that 
more than for beauty but she tell the duke 
she have offend in a idle promise 
and that be object to she for a crime 
a piece of impudence unparallel 
when have she mean to have wrong her royal lord 
she will have lock the secret in her heart 
and set her face with smile beat with kiss 
suspicion from his bosom but she discover 
the gift the giver and the vow that buy it 
who be it not know dishonesty consist 
in the deed do not in the speak word 
and she imagine the deed in which 
she employ the doer never to be do 
and so the wickedness let i not be think tedious 
nor be offensive if I bring to mind 
the meeting of those two how she reveal 
that you great duke consent to the fact 
encourage she unto it and lead she on 
if she have be a villain to her death 
but he look on she and see in her eye 
the image of fair virtue how it weep 
give back her vow and free she from his heart 
in that shape first she stand but again place she 
as his most roy all mistress and your wife 

excellent voice go on for I can stand 
a tedious winter but to hear thou talk 

so can not I without a rug gown 

it have be still a maxim she be not chaste 
that have not be attempt but she who have stand 
temptation and resist gold be the pure 
for be try and virtue put in act 
appear more glorious when it have wrought itself 
out of those trouble which will stifle it 
heaven be assault by the giant once 
which show jove power the great the pensive soul 
fight with sin the devil and with death 
after the victory triumph and sing 
eternal among the bless angel 
crown with perpetual peace and happiness 
but she for be virtuous must die 
for conquer her affection for love 
sincere and effectual her lord 
for have not the cunning to dissemble 
but for be simple chaste and innocent 
just noble beauteous excellent in all 
save what no common woman will have miss 
for this and for this only she must die 

no she must live and all the world must die 
to i before a hair of she shall perish 
o I have wrong thy goodness now I see it 
who be before make blind with jealousy 
the heaven take thy part and will suffer 
so much of worthiness to fall at once 
lest nothing here but wickedness abound

by which you will infer my duchess honest 

by all the best hope of a die man

whether my joy be sensual or immortal

and stand on such a change as if my soul 
be melt into blood or my blood turn 
to soul which light i up fresh taper 
who instructive beam direct i to the heart 
of my dear duchess where chastity I find 
have build her temple within there

tread the bright ring and from the order sphere 
strike heavenly music to all earthly ear 
give i your royal pardon and remit i 
the hand of death lie cold and weighty on i

thus be I bid to my sovereign 
fall on my face now rise I up again 
to render to the lady fair salute 
and give they all their worthy attribute 
wonder not that I resolute come 
bold thus dare press into this room 
for from a lord and knight of eminent note 
I bring this challenge such as can read may know it 

very succinct and peremptory 

for this day I be master of the revel 
be it know unto all man that I of the court of Saxony traveller by degree a lord and a profess champion for all lady in the list of peace do challenge all courtier whatsoever without exception native or stranger to confer court or compliment in silence with discursive motion and true action of the face hand body and leg and afterward with the volubility of the tongue to talk long fast and loud for sense I stand not upon it be seldom regard by the party court therefore indeed belong not to the courtier also be it far know that my assistant agent or second do challenge likewise all courtier whatsoever at the true compendious form of compile epistle alias loveletter to lady or mistress either in prose or verse with proverb or without proverb with sentence or without sentence figure or any other matter to be perform extempore or not extempore accord as it shall please the challenge which be to say the defendant to determine all which that aforesaid as well as this now speak of shall be perform by the say challenger instant who only stay to hear of any opponent be both ready to enter 

here be unexpected sport 

let they enter they shall be answer Smirke thou shall be my second 

shall I that be some comfort yet to put the loss of the ring out of my thought 
shall I answer the epistoler 

ay marry shall thou 

I will pistol and pestle he I will warrant he he be never so pound in his life I will scorn to begin after my hearty commendation with he 

hark they approach 

which be my antagonist 

I be he 

and who be i 

behold the man with pen and ink provide 

poor fool thou will but make thyself deride 

so nimble in rhyme I will first break your head in prose and afterward whip you in verse I will lambast you in complete 

nay I will not lose the honour of be the court lady 

when my talk time come I will thank you lady in language 
mark how my challenge go it be not to talk sense only but long fast loud and you our talk i that way I will give you my tongue and every tooth I have to make trotter on for I be bear and breed and nurse a talker and of my quality this lady have have some small experience for I do promise she to prove a talker and for her sake do now profess and practise it and it be in vain for any creature to contend with i I have put down the lawyer of all nation and all woman gossip at christen after they have drink wine the midwife be there word flow out of my mouth like water from the cloud to make a deluge to drown all voice but my own which drum nor trumpet nor a sea flight can do 

but a thump of the gut will 

O 

it be excellent sweet lady to hear word 
though they want matter for silence do betray 
a bashfulness in man unmeet for courtier 
for he that have a bold tongue and a free 
can never want the affection of lady 
nor be it fit he shall for he can keep they 
walk at midnight with a tedious tale 
and long it be the better because sleep 
be account as some use to call it 
death image other some his elder brother 
by how much we do use it by so much less 
we live in this world and lose time and pleasure 
which both to rich and poor be the chief treasure 
why do you talk now 

talk if I have breath enough to live I care not 

nay and you give out you have lose the day 

I have not fair play show i 

stratagem be to be allow against all adversary 
I will have judgement on it 

ay ay lawful lawful 

lawful let it be then but if ever I challenge a man of his hand to a trial of skill with the tongue again I will forswear talk all day of my life and that I will be loath to do if I do feel the very breath that shall have be spend in word upward to twattle downward I be a villain 

I believe I smell the meaning stand far off and give room to i and the epistoler you challenge all man to compose 

I do 

with figure or without figure with sentence or without sentence 

it be right 

draw out your pen and inkhorn I be for you 

give they room and set a table forth 

with expedition too I put in that 

no expedition belong to clerk and not to secretary celerity if you will 

ay sir celerity I mean so 

no more but so a word enough 

but what be the subject 

why each of we be to indite a epistle to our mistress be it not so 

right 

then write 

this will be good mirth I hope 

ridiculous enough 

so it shall be and yet my little smirk here have conceit he will have some flash 

a couple of pretty scribe 

the challenger have the advantage he may premeditate 

no matter smirk best at a start his wit be like your hackney all a gallop to which he say vtere diligentia nec sis tantus cessator & calcoribus indigeas which be claw the pole as for example in your challenger 

he have rub it out it seem 

Smirke go on smooth without any rub 

yet there he have one 

hold bias and a sentence then 

scripsi 

et scripsi 

very good now lording lend your care 

I will read it first myself 

and good reason 

fair in the world and sweet upon earth 

so 

I remember my duty to you in black and white 

I will it have be black and blue 

peace 

for all colour else wave under the standard of your beauty 

I wonder what part of she be gooseturd green that be a colour 

you be the mistress of beauty 

I will a say the queen or empress 

and all other woman be but your handmaid 

o abominable barren 

nay smirk silence you must not interrupt your adversary 

I can say nothing without say too much nor say too much without say nothing 

I must say nothing or else I will say something but here it be shall shame thou 

methinks when thou stand in the sun with thy feather on thy head and thy fan in thy hand thou look like the phoenix of the east Indies burn in spice for clove mace and nutmeg be in thy breath 

she will make a excellent wassailbowl 

again 

I have do 

the apple of thy breast be like the lemon of Arabia which make the vessel so sweet it can never smell of the cask 

if she shall that may prove the brewer fault 

be come to your middle I must draw to a end for my end be at the middle because of the proverb in medio consistet virtus and so I conclude your while my own and afterward if it be possible Marmaduke Ranoff 

well now let i run on judgement I crave 

which thou shall have 

illustrious bright shine well speak and blood stir lady 

ay marry sir 

if the rope of my capacity can reach to the belfry of your beauty these word of my like silver bell may be worthy to hang in the ear of your favour but the ladder of my invention be too low to climb up to the steeple of your understanding 

excellent Smirke 

if it be not I shall ring out my mind to you in a sweet peal of most savoury conceit for your face it be like the sun no man be able to endure it 

that be very good 

your forehead which I will neither compare unto alabaster nor to the lily but it be as it be and so be both your eye for your nose it be a well arch bridge which for brevity sake I pass over your cheek be like a good comedy worthy to be clap your lip and your tooth be incomparable your tongue like the instrument of Orpheus able to tame the fury to handle every part of you be too much but some particular part no man can sufficient 

prithee let i give thou a box on the care for that conceit 

no my good lord pray keep your bounty 
from top to toe you be a sweet vessel of delight I dare not say a barrel for oftentimes with much jolt the brewer beat out the bunghole and so the good liquor run out but you contain you although not hoop about with the old fashion farthingale but after the new fashion tie up with point to untruss at your pleasure in which pleasure I leave you fair of a hundred and witty of a thousand rest in little rest till I rest whole you in the downebed of affection wherever stand to my utmost I rest all in all you 

can any man say more 

your censure hereafter gentleman now sir I challenge you in verse in praise of tall woman and little woman and choose your subject which you refuse I will take 

why then I will take your little woman 

and I your lusty proceed 

ay here will be some sport now 

the duke call to see the epistle 

and they be worth his perusal 

we must have patience for this verse will come of so round as your prose 

best have a song to entertain the time 

it be not a miss 
music 

scripsi 

say non feci stay a little here be a couple of line a halter on they they will twist handsome go forward I have end 

attention 

listen you tall and likewise you low man 
I sing the praise of a bounce woman 
a full well set bigboned and fair joint 
fit to bid welcome man that be best appoint 

excellent 

to your tall woman your little one be nothing 
no more than be a high thing to a low thing 

that be true 

for your small dandiprat I hope there be no man 
that think she but a hobby horse to woman 
a thing to be forget and never know 
but on a holiday to the rout show 
in war the basilisk be prefer 
before the musket and be loud hear 

there be a error little and loud my friend but pass it 

in every triumph where there be excess 
the great always put down the less 
the lioness be more admire at 
than her epitome which be a cat 

the fool grow serious 

he have steal it certain 

no faith it may be his own for I think his brain 
a little craze and mad man shoot forth strange thing 

but to weak understanding now I come 
be your small taber music to your drum 

Hum drum he have lighten within a inch of a conceit of i 

or in instrument of peace can there that trial 
be make upon a kit as a base viol 
judge you my master that on both have play 
it be but my opinion and I have say 

believe it he have say well Smirke look to yourself 

I warrant you give i audience 

silence 

in praise of little woman I begin 
and will maintain what I have enter in 
be not your parakeet or marmoset 
in more request than your baboon or parrot 
give but your little wench free her liquour 
and to bed send she you will find her quick 
pert nimble both to kiss and cog 
than your great wench that will lie like a log 
and he that all day at the drum do labour 
will at night glad play upon a taber 
I hope there be no man but of this belief 
that veal be more sweet and nourish then beef 
small meat be still prefer for ask your glutton 
he will always say lamb be sweet than your mutton 
your smell than Whiting firm be and sound 
nor must your place compare with your neat flounder 

Well say now thou be in good victual thou will never out 

in fish or flesh I will prove it to each wight 
a lark leg than the body of a kite 
be better far our baker always make 
the fine flower in the lesser cake 
and I will be judge by those that root do eat 
that your small turnip be better than your great 

I be of thy mind too 

who list to be resolve let they both try 
in that belief I live in that I will die 

incomparable Smirke thou have my voice judgement 

a smirk a smirk 

loath to grow tedious yet once more we will try 
to give content out of variety 
with once dance more this night sport we will end 
your pardon if with too much zeal we offend 

Landoff we thank thou and wish if any be 
all that be here be please as well as we
