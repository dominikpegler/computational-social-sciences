dare she despise i thus i that with spoil 
and hazardous exploit full sixteen year 
have lead as handmaiden fortune victory 
who the Maltezi call my servitor 
tempest I have subdue and fight they calm 
outlightened lightning in my chivalry 
rid tame as patience billow that kick heaven 
whistle enrage Boreas till his gust 
be grow so gentle that he seem to sigh 
because he can not show the air my keel 
and yet I can conquer her bright eye 
which though they blaze both comfort and invite 
neither by force nor fraud pass through her ear 
who guard it only blush innocence 
to take the least possession of her heart 
do I attempt she with a threadbare name unapt with meritorious action 
she may with colour disallow my suit 
but by the honour of this christian cross 
in blood of infidel so often die 
which my own soul and sword have fix here 
and neither favour nor birth privilege 
Oriana shall confess although she be 
valetias sister our grandmaster here 
the wage of scorn love be baneful hate enter Rocca 
and if I rule not she I will rule her fate 
Rocca my trusty servant welcome

I bring you sir her smile not i 

her smile 
why they be present for king old son 
great Solyman that weary his hot eye 
but to peruse his deck seraglio 
when from the number of his concubine 
he choose one for that night in his pride 
of they wife wealth be not so rich as I 
in this one smile from Oriana send 

sir fare you well 

o Rocca thou be wise 
and will not have the torrent of my joy 
ruin i headlong apt thou conceive 
if one revive smile can raise i thus 
what trance will the sweet word which thou bring 
cast i into I feel my dear friend

and carry faithful thy master sigh 
that it must work some heat in her cold heart 
and all my labour now come fraught home 
with ten fold prize 

will you yet hear i 

yes 
but take heed gentle Rocca that thou do 
tender by degree assault my ear 
with her consent now to embrace my love 
for thou well know I have be so plunge so tear 
with she resolve reject and neglect 
that to report her soft acceptance now 
will stupefy sense in i if not kill 
why show thou this distemper

I bring you smile of pity not affection 
for such she send

Waken sir and know 
that her contempt if you can name it so 
continue still she bid you throw your pearl 
into strong stream and hope to turn they so 
ere she to foul dishonour write your plaint 
in rock of coral grow above the sea 
they hope to soften to compassion 
or change their modest blush to love sick pale 
ere work she to your impious request 
all your loose thought she chide you home again 
but with such calm behaviour and mild look 
she gently deny than other grant 
for just as other love so do she hate 
she say that by your order you be bind 
from marry ever and much marvel than 
you will thus violate she and your own faith 
that be the virgin you shall now protect 
hitherto she profess she have conceal 
your lustful battery but the next she vow 
in open hall before the honour cross 
and her great brother she will quite disclose 
call for justice to your utter shame 

hence find the blackamoor that wait upon she 
bring she unto i she do love i yet 
and I must she now at least seem to do 
Cupid thy brand that glow thus in my vein 
I will with blood extinguish be not go

while any other revel in her breast 
sweat on my spirit know thou trick up toy

White innocent sign that do abhor to dwell 
so near the dim thought of this trouble breast 
and grace these graceless project of my heart enter Zanthia alias Abdella Zan with 2 letter 
yet I must wear thou to protect my crime 
if not for conscience for hypocrisy

my pearl that scorn a stain I much repent 
all my neglect let i Ixion like 
embrace my black cloud since my Juno be 
so wrathful and averse thou be more soft 
and full of dalliance than the fair flesh 
and far more love 

ay you say so now 
but like a property when I have serve 
your turn you will cast i off or hang i up 
for a sign somewhere 

may my life then forsake i 
of my expect bliss be cast to hell 

my tongue sir can lisp to meet you so 
nor my black cheek put on a feign blush 
to make i seem more modest than I be 
this groundwork will not bear adulterate red 
nor artificial white to cozen love 
these dark lock be not purchase nor these tooth 
for every night they be my bedfellow 
no bath no blanch water smooth oil 
do mend i up and yet Mountferrat know 
I be as full of pleasure in the touch 
as ere a white face puppet of they all 
juicy and firm unfledge they of their tire 
their wire their partlet pin and periwig 
and they appear like bald coat in the nest 
I can as blithe work in my love bed 
and deck thy fair neck with these jetty chain 
sing thou asleep be weary and refresh 
with the same organ steal sleep off again 

o my black swan silken than signet plush 
sweet then be the sweet of pomander 
breathe like curl Zephyrus cool lymontree 
straight as young pine or cedar in the grove 
quick descend lover best canopy 
still night for Zanthia do enamour i 
beyond all continuance perpetrate dear wench 
what thou have promise and I vow by heaven 
Malta I will leave in it my honour here 
and in some other country Zanthia make 
my wife and my best fortune 

from this hope 
here be a answer to that letter which 
I late show you send from Tripoli 
by the great bassa which importune her 
love unto he and treachery to the island 
which will she undertake by Mahomet 
the Turk there vow on his bless Alcharon 
marriage unto she this the master know 
but be resolve of her integrity 
as well he may sweet lady yet for love 
for love of thou Mountferrat oh what chain 
of deity or duty can hold love 
I have this answer frame so like her hand 
as if it have be mould of return 
the bassa letter safe into her pocket 
what you will do with it yourself best know 
farewell keep my true heart keep true your vow Exit Zan 

till I be dust my Zanthia be confirm 
sparrow and dove sit couple betwixt thy lip 
it be not love but strong libidinous will 
that triumph over i and to satiat that 
what difference betwixt this moor and her fair dame 
night make their hew alike their use be so 
who hand so subtle he can colour name 
if he do wink and touch they lust be blind 
never in woman do distinction find exit 

but i'faith do thou think my lady be never in love 

I rather think she be ever in love in perfect charity 

I mean with all the world 

a most christian answer I promise you but I mean in 
love with a man 

with a man what else will have she in love with a beast 

you be somewhat quick but if she be it be no 
precedent do you never read of Europa the fair that leap 
a bull that leap the sea that swim to land and then leap she 

o heaven a bull 

yes a white bull 

lord how can she sit he where do she hold 

why by the horn since which time no woman almost be 
content till she have a horn of her own to hold by 

thou be very knavish 

and thou very foolish but sirrah why do not thou marry 

because I will be no man lookingglass 

as how Oriana ready above 

as thus there be no wife if she be good and true will honour and obey but must reflect the true countenance of her husband upon he if he look sad upon she she must not look merry upon he if he look merry she must not sorrowful else she be a false glass and fit for nothing but break his anger must be her discontent his pleasure her delight if he weep she must cry if he laugh she must show her tooth if he be sick she must not be in health if he eat caudle she must eat pottage she must have no proper passion of her own and be not this a tyranny 

yes i'faith marriage may well be call a yoke wife then be but like superficial line in geometry that have no proper motion of their own but as their body their husband move yet I know some wife that be never free merry nor true please but when they be far of their husband 

that be because the moon govern they which have most light and shine bright the more remote it be from the sun and contrary be more sullen dim and show least splendour when it be near 

but if I be to marry I will marry a fair effeminate fool 

why 

because I will lead the blind whether I list 

and I the wise man I can get for money because I have rather follow the clearsighted bless i from a husband that sale by his wife compass 

why 

why it be ten to one but she break his head in her youth and when she be old she will never leave till she have break his back too 
but what scurvy knight have you here in Malta etc 

Hist wench my lady call she be enter the terrace to see the show 

o black pudding 

my little labour in vain 

but what scurvy knight have we here in Malta that when they be dub take their oath of allegiance to live poor and chaste ever after

that can deserve he 

of all man I say 
that dare for it be a desperate adventure 
wear on their free neck the sweet yoke of woman 
for they that do repine be no true husband 
give i a soldier 

why be they more love 
than other man 

and love too with more judgement 
for but observe you courtier be more curious 
to set himself forth rich then his lady 
his bath perfume nay painting too more costly 
than his frugality will allow to she 
his clothes as chargeable and grant he but 
a thing without a beard and he may pass 
at all time for a woman and with some 
have better welcome now your man of land 
for the most part be careful to manure they 
but leave his lady fallow your great merchant 
break often for the debt he owe his wife 
then with his creditor and that be the reason 
she look elsewhere for payment now your soldier 

I marry do he right 

first who have one 
have a perpetual guard upon her honour 
for while he wear a sword Isander herself 
dare not bark at it next she sit at home 
like a great queen and tend he forth to fetch in 
her tribute from all part which be bring home 
he lay it at her foot and seek no further 
for his reward than what she may give free 
and with delight too from her own exchequer 
which he find ever open 

be more modest 

why we may speak of that we be glad to taste of 
among ourselves in mean 

thou talk of nothing 

of nothing madam you have find it something 
or with the raise up this pretty mount here 
my lord have deal with spirit enter Gomera 

two long hour absent 

thy pardon sweet I have be look on 
the prize that be bring in by the brave Dane 
the valiant norandine and have bring something 
that may be thou will like of but one kiss 
and then possess my purchase there be a piece 
of cloth of tissue this of purple velvet 
and as they swear of the right tyrian dye 
which other hear but weak counterfeit 
if they be worth thy use wear they if not 
bestow they on thy woman 

here be the husband 

while there be any trade o the sea 
thou shall want nothing it be a soldier glory 
however he neglect himself to keep 
his mistress in full lustre 

you exceed sir 

yet there be one part of the prize dispose of 
before I come which I grieve that I miss of 
be almost assure it will have be 
a welcome present 

pray you say what be it 

a turkish captive of incomparable beauty 
and without question in her country noble 
which as companion to thy faithful noble 
I will have give thou for thy slave 

but be she 
of such a exquisite form 

most equisite 

and well descend 

So the habit promise 
in which she be take 

of what year 

it be say 
a virgin of fourteen 

I pity she 
and wish she be i that I may have the mean 
to entertain she gentle 

she be now miranda 
and as I have hear make it she suit to be so 

Miranda s than her fate deserve not pity 
but envy rather 

envy Oriana 

yes and their envy that live free 

how be this 

why she be fall into the hand of one 
so full of that which in man we style goodness 
that in she be his slave she be happy far 
than if she be confirm the sultan mistress 

Miranda be indeed a gentleman 
of fair desert and better hope but yet 
he have his equal 

where I will go far 
as I be now though much unfit for travail 
but to see one that without injury 
may be put in the scale or parallel 
in any thing that be noble with Miranda 
his knowledge in all service of war 
and ready courage to put into act 
that know judgement as you be a soldier 
you best may speak of nor can you deliver 
nor I hear with delight a better subject 
and heaven do well in such a lovely feature 
to place so chaste a mind for he be of 
so sweet a carriage such a win nature 
and such a bold yet well dispose behaviour 
and to all these he have such a charm tongue 
that if he will serve under love fresh colour 
what monumental trophy may he raise 
of his free conquest make in lady favour 

yet you do resist he when he be 
a earnest suitor to you 

yes I do 
and if I be again seek to I shall 
but must ascribe it rather to the fate 
that do appoint i you than any power 
which I can call my own 

even so 

thank fortune 
the plot I have to raise in he doubt of she 
thou have effect 

I can tell you too 
what cause I have to love he with what reason 
in thankfulness he may expect from i 
all due observance but I pass that as 
a benefit for which in my behalf 
you be his debtor 

I perceive it take 
by his change look 

he be not in the city 
be he my lord 

who lady 

why Miranda 
have you here can there be any else 
worth my enquiry 

this be somewhat more 
then love to virtue 

faith when he come hither 
as sometime without question you shall meet he 
invite he home 

to what end 

to dine with we 
or sup 

and then to take a hard bed with you 
mean you not so 

if you can win he to it 
it will be the better for his entertainment 
leave that to i he shall find noble usage 
and from i a free welcome 

have you never 
hear of a roman lady Oriana 
remember as a precedent for matron 
chaste one I pray you understand who husband 
tax for his sour breath by his enemy 
condemn his wife for not acquaint he 
with his infirmity 

it be a common one 
her answer be have kiss none but he 
she think it be a general disease 
all man be subject to but what infer you 
from that my lord 

why that this virtuous lady 
have all her thought so fix upon her lord 
that she can find no spare time to sing praise 
of any other nor will she employ 
her husband though perhaps in debt to year 
as far as I be for a instrument 
to bring home young man that may delight she 
with their discourse or 

what my lord 

their person 
or if I shout speak plain 

no it need not 
you have say enough to make my innocence know 
it be suspect 

you betray yourself 
to more than a suspicion can you else 
to i that live in nothing but love to you 
make such a gross discovery that your lust 
have sell that heart I think my to Miranda 
or rise to such a height in impudence 
as to presume to work my yield weakness 
to play for your bad end to my disgrace 
the wittol or the pander 

do not study 
to print more wound for that be tyranny 
upon a heart that be pierce through already 

thy heart thou have pierce through my honour false one 
the honour of my house fool that I be 
to give it up to the deceive trust 
of wicked woman for thy sake vild creature 
for all I have do well in in my life 
I have dig a grave all bury in a wife 
for thou I have defy my constant mistress 
that never fail her servant glorious war 
for thou refuse the fellowship of a order 
which prince through all danger have be proud 
to fetch as far as from Jerusalem 
and be I thus reward 

by all goodness 
you wrong my lady and deserve she not 
when you be at your best repent your rashness 
it will show well in you 

do and ask her pardon 

no I have live too long to have my faith 
my try faith call in question and by he 
that shall know true affection be too tender 
to suffer a unkind touch without ruin 
study ingratitude all from my example 
for to be thankful now be to be false 
but be it so let i die I see you wish it 
yet dead for truth and pity sake report 
what weapon you make choice of when you kill i 

she faint 

what have you do 

my last breath can 
be better spend than to say I forgive you 
nor be my death untimely since with i 
I take along what may have be hereafter 
in scorn deliver for the doubtful issue 
of a suspect mother 

o she be go 

for ever go be you a man 

I grow here 

open she mouth and pour this cordial in it 
if any spark of life be unquenched in she 
this will recover she 

it be all in vain 
she be stiff already live I and she dead 

how like a murderer I stand look up 
and hear i curse myself or but behold 
the vengeance I will take for it Oriana 
and then in peace forsake i jealousy 
thou loathsome vomit of the fiend below 
what desperate hunger make i to receive thou 
into my heart and soul I let thou forth 
and so in death find ease and do ray fault then 
deserve no great punishment no I will live 
to keep thou for a fury to torment i 
and make i know what hell be on the earth 
all joy and hope forsake i all man malice 
and all the plague they can inflict I wish it 
fall thick upon i let my tear be laugh at 
and may my enemy smile to hear i groan 
and dead may I be pity of none exeunt 

pray you sir why be the ordnance of the fort discharge so sudden 

it be the governor pleasure 
in honour of the Dane a custom use 
to speak a soldier welcome 

it be a fit one 
but be my master here too 

three day since 

may I demand without offence so much 
be it pride in he however now a slave 
that I be not admit to his presence 

his courtesy to you and to mankind 
may easy resolve you he be free 
from that poor vice which only empty man 
esteem a virtue 

what be the reason then 
as you imagine sir 

why I will tell you 
you be a woman of a tempt beauty 
and he however virtuous as a man 
subject to humane frailty and how far 
they may prevail upon he shall he see you 
he be not ignorant and therefore choose 
with care to avoid the cause that may produce 
some strange effect which will not well keep rank 
with the rare temperance which be admire 
in his life hitherto 

this much increase 
my strong desire to see he 

it shall rather 
teach you to thank the prophet that you worship 
that you be such a man who though he may 
do any thing which youth and heat of blood 
invite he to yet dare not give way to they 
your entertainment be noble and not like 
your present fortune and it all those tear 
which make grief lovely in you in the relation 
of the sad story that force i to weep too 
your husband hard fate be not counterfeit 
you shall rejoice that you have mean to pay 
a chaste life to his memory and bring to he 
those sweet which while he live he can not taste of 
but if you wanton bestow they on 
another man you offer violence 
to he though dead and his grieve spirit will suffer 
for your immodest looseness 

why I hope sir 
my willingness to look on he to who 
I owe my life and service be no proof 
of any unchaste purpose 

so I wish too 
and in the confidence it be not lady 
I dare the better tell you he will see you 
this night in which by he I be command 
to bring you to his chamber to what end 
I easy shall guess be I Miranda 
and therefore though I can yield little reason 
but in a general love to woman goodness 
why I shall be so tender of your honour 
I willing will bestow some counsel of you 
and will you follow it 

let i first hear it 
and then I can resolve you 

my advice then 
be that you will not as most lady use 
when they prepare themselves for such encounter 
study to add by artificial dress 
to native excellence you without help 
but see as it be now will make a hermit 
leave his death head and change his after hope 
of endless comfort for a few short minute 
of present pleasure to prevent which lady 
practice to take away from your perfection 
and to preserve your chastity unstained 
the most deform shape that you can put on 
to cloud your body fair gift or your mind 
it be labour to so chaste a end 
will prove the fair ornament 

to take from 
the workmanship of heaven be a offence 
as great as to endeavour to add to it 
of which I will not be guilty chastity 
that lodge in deformity appear rather 
a mulct impose by nature than a blessing 
and it be commendable only when it conquer 
though never so oft assault in resistance 
for i I will therefore so dispose myself 
that if I hold out it shall be with honour 
or if I yield Miranda shall find something 
to make he love his victory Exit 

with what cunning 
this woman argue for her own damnation 
nor shall I hold it for a miracle 
since they be all bear sophister to maintain 
that lust be lawful and the end and use 
of their creation will I never have 
hope better of she or can not believe 
though see the i I must ever grieve Exit 

I will see you in your chamber a table out tow stool 

pray you no far 
it be a ceremony I expect not 
I be no stranger here I know my lodging 
and have sleep sound there when the Turk cannon

this be the foul play I will show good night sweet 

the sun be not set yet 

no sir 

will it be 
never to rise again to light the world 
and yet to what vain purpose do I wish it 
since though I be environ with thick mist 
black as Cimmerian darkness or my crime 
there be that here upon which as a anvil 
ten thousand hammer strike and every spark 
they force from it to i be another sun 
to light i to my shame 

take hope and comfort 

they be aide indeed but yet as far from i 
as I from be innocent this cave fashion 
by provident nature in this solid rock 
to be a den for beast alone receive i 
and have prove a enemy to mankind 
all humane help forsake i 

I will never leave you 
and wish you will call back that noble courage 
that old invincible fortitude of you 
that use to shrink at nothing 

then it do not 
but it be when I be honest then in the height 
of all my happiness of all my glory 
of all delight that make life precious to i 
I dare die Rocca death itself then to i 
be nothing terrible because I know 
the fame of a good knight will ever live 
fresh on my memory but since I fall 
from my integrity and dismiss those guard 
those strong assurance of innocence 
that constancy flee from i and what be worse 
now I be loathsome to myself and life 
a burden to i rack with sad remembrance 
of what I have do and my present horror 
unsufferable to i torture with despair 
that I shall never find mercy hell about i 
behind i and before i yet I dare not 
still fear worse put off my wretched be enter Abdella 

to see this will deter a doubtful man 
from mischievous intent much more the practice 
of what be wicked here be the moor look up sir 
some ease may come from she 

new trouble rather 
and I expect it 

who be this Mountferrat 
rise up for shame and like a river dry up 
with a long drought from i your bounteous sea 
receive those tide of comfort that flow to you 
if ever I look lovely if desert 
can ever challenge welcome if revenge 
and unexpected wreak be ever please 
or can endear the giver of such blessing 
all these I come adorn with and as due 
make challenge of those so long wish embrace 
which you unkind have hitherto deny i 

why what have you do for i 

make Gomera 
as true miserable as you think he happy 
can you wish more 

as if his sickness can 
recover i the injury I receive 
Were oriana 

she have pay dear for they 
she be dead 

how 

dead my hate can reach no further 
take advantage of she in a swoon 
under pretence to give a cordial to she 
I poison she what stupid dulness be this 
what you shall entertain with sacrifice 
can you receive so cold 

bloody deed 
be grateful offering please to the devil 
and thou in thy black shape and black action 
be hell perfect character be delight 
to do what I though infinite wicked 
tremble to hear thou have in this take from i 
all mean to make amends with penitence 
to her wrong virtue and despoil i of 
the poor remainder of that hope be leave i 
for all I have already or must suffer 

I do it for the best 

for thy worst end 
and be assure but that I think to kill thou 
will but prevent what thy despair must force thou 
to do unto thyself and so to add to 
thy most assure damnation thou go dead now 
but get thou from my sight and if lust of i 
do ever fire thou love I can call it 
leap down from those steep rock or take advantage 
of the next tree to hang thyself and then 
I may laugh at it 

in the mean time 
I must be bold to do so much for you ha ha 

why grinst thou devil 

that it be in my power 
to punish thy ingratitude I make trial 
but how you stand affect and since I know 
I be use only for a property 
I can and will revenge it to the full 
for understand in thy contempt of i 
those hope of Oriana which I can 
have change to certainty be lose for ever 

why live she 

yes but never to Mountferrat 
although it be in i with as much ease 
to give she free up to thy possession 
as to remove this rush which yet despair of 
for by my much wrong love flattery nor threat 
tear prayer nor vow shall ever win i to it 
so with my curse I leave thou

so strange remission superfluous 
but one petition I have do 

what sweet 

to call i lord if the hard hand of death seize on Gomera first 

o much too worthy 
how much you undervalue your own price 
to give your unbought self for a poor woman 
that have be once sell use and lose she show 
I be a garment wear a vessel crack 
a zone untie a lily tread upon 
a fragrant flower crop by another hand 
my colour sully and my odour change 
if when I be new blossom I do fear 
myself unworthy of miranda spring 
thus overblow and seed I be rather 
fit to adorn his chimney than his bed 

rise miracle save Malta with thy virtue 
if word can make i proud how have she speak 
yet I will try she to the very block 
hardhearted and uncivil Oriana 
ingrateful payer of my industry 
that with a soft paint hypocrisy 
cozen and geer my perturbation 
expect a witty and a fell revenge 
my comfort be all man will think thou false 
beside thy husband have be thus long enter Nor Collonna and Lucinda with a child

and on the top of that thy name shall stand 
fresh and without decay 

o honour sir 
if hope of this or any bliss to come

or expiate the trespass against my wife 
that in one hour suspicion I beget 
I may be win to be a man again 
and fare like other husband sleep and eat 
laugh and forget my please penitence 
but till old nature can make such a wife 
again I vow never to resume the order 
and habit that to man be necessary 
all breath I will spend in sigh all sound in groan 
and know no company but my waste moan 

this will be wilful murder on yourself 
nor like a christian do you bear the chance 
which the inscrutable will of heaven admit 

what will you have my weakness do that 
suffer itself thus to be practise on 
by a damn hellhound and his agent dam
