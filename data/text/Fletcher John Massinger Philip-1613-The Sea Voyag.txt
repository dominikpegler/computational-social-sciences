how do we lose Clarinda 

when we believe the stag be spend and will take soil 
the sight of the black lake which we suppose 
he choose for his last refuge fright he more 
than we that do pursue he 

that be usual for death itself be not so terrible 
to any beast of chase 

since we live here we never can force one to it 

it be so dreadful 
bird that with their pinion cleave the air 
dare not fly over it when the stag turn head 
and we even tire with labour Clarinda as if 
she be make of air and fire 
and have no part of earth in she eager pursue he 
nor need we fear her safety this place yield not 
fawn nor satyr or more lustful man 
here we live secure 
and have among ourselves a commonwealth 
which in ourselves begin with we must end 

i there be the misery 

but be alone 
allow i freedom but to speak my thought 
the strictness of our governess that forbid we 
on pain of death the sight and use of man 
be more than tyranny for herself she be past 
those youthful heat and feel not the want 
of that which young maid long for and her daughter 
the fair Clarinda though in few year 
improve in height and large proportion 
come here so young 
that scarce remember that she have a father 
she never dream of man and shall she see one 
in my opinion he will appear a strange beast to she 

it be not so with we 

for my part I confess it I be not make 
for this single life nor do I love hunt so 
but that I have rather be the chase myself 

by Venus out upon i I shall have swear 
by Diana I be of thy mind too wench 
and though I have take a oath not alone 
to detest but never to think of man 
every hour something tell i I be forswear 
for I confess imagination help i sometime 
and that be all be leave for we to feed on 
we may starve else for if I have any pleasure 
in this life but when I sleep I be a pagan 
then from the courtier to the country clown 
I have strange vision 

vision crocale 

yes and fine vision too 
and vision I hope in dream be harmless 
and not forbid by our canon the last night 
troth it be a foolish one but I must tell it 
as I lie in my cabin betwixt sleep and wake 

upon your back 

how shall a young maid lie fool 
when she will be intrance 

we be instruct forward I prithee 

methinks a sweet young man 
in year some twenty with a downy chin 
promise a future beard and yet no red one 
steal sly to my cabin all unbrace 
take i in his arm and kiss i twenty time

they take to leave we rich be not honest 
nor can that friendship last which virtue join not 
when first they force the industrious Portugal 
from their plantation in the happy island 

this be that I watch for 

and do omit no tyranny which man 
enure to spoil and mischief can inflict 
on the grieve sufferer when by lawless rapine 
they reap the harvest which their labour sow 
and not content to force they from their dwell

the last remainder of their wealth then then 
after a long pursuit each doubt other 
as guilty of the Portugal escape 
they do begin to quarrel like ill man 
forgive i piety that I call they so 
no long love or correspondence hold 
than it be cement with prey or profit 
then do they turn those sword they oft have bloody 
with innocent gore upon their wretched self 
and pay the forfeit of their cruelty 
show to Sebastian and his colony

Thence grow Amyntas rape and my desire 
to be revenge and now observe the issue
