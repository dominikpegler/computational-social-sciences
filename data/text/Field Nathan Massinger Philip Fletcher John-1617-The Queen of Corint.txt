the general be return then 

with much honour 

and peace conclude with the prince of Argos 

to the queen wish the condition sign 
so far beyond her hope to the advantage 
of Corinth and the good of all her subject 
that though Leonidas our brave general 
ever come home a fair and great example 
he never yet return or with less loss 
or more deserve honour 

have you not hear 
the motive to this general good 

the main one 
be admiration first in young Agenor 
for by that name we know the prince of Argos 
of our Leonidas wisdom and his valour 
which though a enemy first in he breed wonder 
that like love succeed that which be 
follow by a desire to be a friend 
upon what term soever to such goodness 
they have a interview and that their friendship 
may with our peace be ratify it be conclude 
Agenor yield up all such strong place 
as he hold in our territory shall receive 
with a sufficient dower pay by the queen 
the fair Merione for his wife 

but how 
approve the queen of this since we well know 
nor be her highness ignorant that her son 
the prince Theanor make love to this lady 
and in the noble way 

which she allow of 
and I have hear from some familiar with 
her near secret she so deep prize she 
be from a infant train up in her service 
or to speak better rather her own creature 
she once do say that if the prince shall steal 
a marriage without her leave or knowledge 
with this Merione with a little suit 
she shall grant both their pardon where as now 
to show herself forsooth a spartan lady 
and that it be in her power now it concern 
the common good not alone to subdue 
her own affection but command her son 
she have not only force he with rough threat 
to leave his mistress but compel he when 
Agenor make his entrance into Corinth 
to wait upon his rival 

can it be 
the prince shall sit down with this wrong 

I know not 
I be sure I shall not 

trust i nor I 
a mother be a name but put in balance 
with a young wench it be nothing where do you leave he 

near Vesta temple for there he dismiss i 
and full of trouble thought call for Crates 
he go with he but whither or to what purpose 
I be a stranger 

they be come back Neanthes 

I like the place well 

well sir it be build 
as if the architect have be a prophet 
and fashion it alone for this night action 
the vault so hollow and the wall so strong 
as Diana there might suffer violence 
and with loud shriek in vain call Jove to help she 
or shall he hear his thunder can not find 
a entrance to it 

I give up myself 
whole to thy direction worthy Crates 
and yet the desperate cure that we must practice 
be in itself so foul and full of danger 
that I stand doubtful whether it be more manly 
to die not seek help or that help be 
so deadly to pursue it 

to those reason 
I have already urge I will add these 
for but consider sir 

it be of weight 
whatever it be that with such vehement action 
of eye hand foot nay all his body motion 
Crates incite the prince to 

then observe 
with what variety of passion he 
receive his reason now he be pale and shake 
for fear or anger now his natural red 
come back again and with a please smile 
he seem to entertain it it be resolve on 
be it what it will to his end may it prosper 
though the state sink for it 

now you be a prince 
fit to rule other and in shake off 
the bond in which your mother fetter you 
discharge your debt to nature she be your guide 
follow she bold sir 

I be confirm 
fall what may fall 

yet still disguise your malice 
in your humility 

I be instruct 

though in your heart there rage a thousand tempest 
all calmness in your look 

I shall remember 

and at no hand though these be use as agent 
acquaint they with your purpose till the instant 
that we employ they it be not fit they have 
time to consider when it be do reward 
or fear will keep they silent yet you may 
grace they as you pass by it will make they sure 
and greedy to deserve you 

I will move only 
as you will have i good day gentleman 
nay spare this ceremonious form of duty 
to he that bring love to you equal love 
and be in nothing happy than in know 
it be return by you we be as one 

I be overjoy I know not 
how to reply but 

hang all butt my lord 
for this your bounteous favour 

let i speak 
if to feed vulture hereafter the halter 
have do his part or if there be a hell 
to take a swinge or two there may deserve this 

we be ready 

try we any way 

put we to it 

what jewel I have in you 

have these soul 
that for a good look and a few kind word 
part with their essence 

since you will compel i 
to put that to the trial which I doubt not 
Crates may be sudden will instruct you 
how and in what to show your love obey he 
as you will bind i to you 

it be well ground 
leave i to rear the building 

we will do 

I know it 

any thing you will put we to exeunt 

sister I reap the harvest of my labour 
in your preferment be you worthy of it 
and with a open bosom entertain 
a great fortune than my love dare hope for 
be wise and welcome it play not the coy 
and foolish wanton with the offer bounty 
of he that be a prince I be woo for you 
and win Merione then if you dare 
believe the object that take i be worthy 
or trust my judgement in i think you be 
court sue to and conquer 

noble brother 
I have and still esteem you as a father 
and will as far obey you my heart speak it 
and yet without your anger give i leave 
to say that in the choice of that on which 
all my life joy or sorrow have dependence 
it have be fit ere you have make a full 
and absolute grant of i to any other 
I shall have use my own eye or at least 
make you to understand whether it be 
within my power to make a second gift 
of my poor self 

I know what it be you point at 
the prince theanos love let not that cheat you 
his vow be but mere courtship all his service 
but practise how to entrap a credulous lady 
or grant it serious yet you must remember 
he be not to love but where the queen his mother 
must give allowance which to you be bar up 
and therefore study to forget that ever 
you cherish such a hope 

I will I can 

but brave Agenor who be come in person 
to celebrate this marriage for your love 
forgive the forfeit of ten thousand life 
that must have fall under the sword of war 
have not this peace be make which general good 
both country owe to his affection to you 
oh happy sister ask this noble lady 
your bosom friend since I fail in my credit 
what palm Agenor name above all prince 
that Greece be proud of carry and with lustre 

Indeed fame give he out of excellent 
and friend I doubt not but when you shall see he 
he will so appear to you be sure it be he 

as I live madam 

virtue enable i to contain my joy

So prithee tell he Exit Ser 

I yield myself too weak 
in argument to oppose you you may lead i 
whither you please 

it be answer like my sister 
and if in he you find not ample cause 
to pray for i and daily on your knee 
conclude I have no judgement 

may it prove so 
friend shall we have your company 

two hour hence 
I will not fail you 

at your pleasure madam Exit leo and Mer

with as much care as I will do my fame 
to entertain your wish return 

best lady 
that I do honour you and with as much reason 
as ever man do virtue that I love you 
yet look upon you with that reverence 
as holy man behold the sun the star 
the temple and their god they all can witness 
and that you have deserve this duty from i 
the life and mean of life for which I owe you 
command i to profess it since my fortune 
afford no other payment 

good Euphanes where benefit be ill confer 
I have think 
that for the trifle courtesy as I call they 
though you give they another name you have 
make ample satisfaction in the acceptance 
and therefore do presume you have bring home 
some other language 

no one I have learn 
yield word sufficient to express your goodness 
nor can I ever choose another theme 
and not be think unthankful 

pray you no more 
as you respect i 

that charm be too powerful 
for i to disobey it it be your pleasure 
and not my boldness madam 

good Euphanes 
believe I be not one of those weak lady 
that barren of all inward worth be proud 
of what they can true call their own 
their birth or fortune which be thing without they 
nor in this will I imitate the world 
who great part of man think when they give 
they purchase bondman not make worthy friend 
by all that be good I swear I never think 
my great estate be a addition to i 
or that your want take from you 

there be few 
so true understand or themselves 
or what they do possess 

good Euphanes 
where benefit 
be ill confer as to unworthy man 
that turn they to bad use the bestower 
for want judgement how and on who to place they 
be partly guilty but when we do favour 
to such as make they ground on which they build 
their noble action there we improve our fortune 
to the most fair advantage if I speak 
too much though I confess I speak well 
prithee remember it be a woman weakness 
and than thou will forgive it 

you speak nothing 
but what will well become the wise man 
and that by you deliver be so please 
that I can hear you ever 

fly not from 
your word for I arrest it and will now 
express myself a little more and prove 
that whereas you profess yourself my debtor 
that I be you 

your ladyship then must use 
some sophistry I never hear of 

by plain reason 
for look you have you never sink beneath 
your want or if those want have find supply 
from Crates your unkind and covetous brother 
or any other man I then have miss 
a subject upon which I worthy 
may exercise my bounty whereas now 
by have happy opportunity 
to furnish you before and in your travel 
with all conveniency that you think useful 
that gold which will have rust in my coffer 
be thus employ have render i a partner 
in all your glorious action and whereas 
have you not be I shall have die a thing 
Scarce know or soon forget there be no trophy 
in which Euphanes for his worth be mention 
but there you have be careful to remember 
that all the good you do come from Beliza 

that be but thankfulness 

it be such a honour 
and such a large return for the poor trash 
I venture with you that if I shall part 
with all that I possess and myself too 
in satisfaction for it it be still short 
of your deserve 

you overprize they madam 

the queen herself have give i gracious thank 
in your behalf for she have hear Euphanes

spread like a river and run calm on 
secure yet from my storm like a young pine

who strong large branch yet do shelter he 
and every traveller admire his beauty 
but like a wind I will work into his crank 
trouble his stream and drown all vessel that 
ride on his greatness under my mother arm 
like to a steal tempest will I search 
and rend his root from her protection

no I have none and will hear none o my honour 
my honour blast in the bud my youth 
my hopeful youth and all my expectation 
ever to be a man be lose for ever 

why nephew we as well as you be dub 
knight of the pantofle 

and be shout at 
kick scorn and laugh at by each page and groom 
yet with erect head we bear it 

Alas

as I a tender gristle apt to bow 
you will like i with cloak envelop 
walk thus than stamp then stare

I hope and then all be i 

why look you pupil

and all be well again the bastinado 
require a long time a year or two 
and then it be bury I grant you have be baffle 
it be but a journey of some thirty year 
and it will be forget 

think you so 

assure 

he may make a short cut 
but hang or drown himself and on my life 
it will no more trouble he 

I can never endure 
or hemp or water they be dangerous tool 
for youth to deal with I will rather follow 
my tutor counsel 

do so 

And put in 
for my security that I will not return 
in thirty year my whole state to my uncle 

that I like well of 

still provide uncle 
that at my come home you will allow i 
to be of age that I may call to account 
this page that have abuse i 

it be a march 

then Corinth thus the bashful Lamprias 
take leave of thou and for this little time 
of thirty year will labour all he can 
though he go young forth to come home a man exeunt 

be your prisoner ready 

when it shall please the queen 
to call they forth my lord 

pray you do i the favour 
to tell i how they have bear themselves this night 
of their imprisonment 

glad sir your brother 
with the other courtier willing receive 
all courtesy I can offer eat and drink 
and be exceed merry so dissemble 
their guilt or confident in their innocence 
that I much wonder at it but the prince 
that as bear high shall have grace his fall 
with great courage be so sink with sorrow 
that to a common judgement you will seem 
to suffer like a woman but to i 
that from the experience I have have of many 
look further in he I do find the deep 
consideration of what be past more fright he 
then any other punishment 

that be indeed 
true magnanimity the other but 
a desperate bastard valour 

I press to he 
and notwithstanding the queen strict command 
have your lordship promise to secure i 
offer to free he from his bond which he 
refuse with such a sorrow mix with scorn 
that it amaze i yet I urge his highness 
to give one reason for it he brief answer 
that he have sit in judgement on himself 
and find that he deserve they that he be 
a ravisher and so to suffer like one 
which be the reason of my tear he add 
for be it not I again shall break the law 
by scorn all their rigour can inflict 
I shall die smile 

I forbear to wonder 
that you be move that see this I be strike 
with the relation so it be very well 
see all thing ready I do wish I can 
send comfort to the prince be ready with he 
it be in the queen breast only which for we bar bring in 
to search into be sauciness to determine 
what she think fit 

make way there for the queen 

Read first the law and what our ancestor 
have in this case provide to deter 
such like offender to you gentle lady 
this only will I can as well give comfort 
as bid you be secure from fear or doubt 
of our displeasure be as confident 
as if your plea be against a common man 
to have all right from we I will not grieve 
for what be not worth my pity read the law 

Lycurgus the nineteenth against rape it be provide and public enact and confirm that any man of what degree soever offer violence to the chastity of a virgin shall ipso facto be liable to her accusation and accord to the say law be censure ever provide that it shall be in the choice of the say virgin so abuse either to compel the offender to marry she without a dowry if so she will be satisfy or demand his head for the offence to have that accord perform 

you hear this what do you demand 

the benefit 
the law allow i 

for the injury 
do to my honour I require his head 

I likewise have a eye upon my honour 
but know that his death can restore it 
I ask he for my husband 

I be ravish 
and will have justice 

I be ravish too 
I kneel for mercy 

I demand but what 
the law allow i 

that which I desire 
be by the same law warrant 

the rape 
on i have make a forfeit of his life 
which in revenge of my disgrace I plead for 

the rape on i give i the privilege 
to be his wife and that be all I sue for 

a doubtful case 

such pretty lawyer yet 
I never see nor read of 

May the queen 
favour your sweet plea madam 

be that justice 
shall one that be to suffer for a rape 
be by a rape defend look upon 
the public enemy of chastity 
this lustful satire who enrage desire 
the ruin of one wretched virgin honour 
will not suffice and shall the wrack of two 
be his protection may be I be ravish 
for his lust only thou for his defence 
oh fine evasion shall with such a sleight 
your justice be delude your law cheat 
and he that for one fact deserve to die 
for sin often find impunity 
but that I know thou I will swear thou be 
a false impostor and suborn to this 
and it may be thou be Merione 
for have thou suffer true what I have do 
thou will like i complain and call for vengeance 
and our wrong be equal I alone 
shall not desire revenge but be it so 
if thou prevail even he will punish it 
and foolish mercy show to he undo thou 
consider fool before it be too late 
what joy thou can expect from such a husband 
to who thy first and what be more force embrace 
which man say heighten pleasure be distasteful 

it be in respect that then they be unlawful 
unblessed by Hymen and leave sting behind they 
which from the marriage bed be ever banish 
let this court be then the image of Jove throne 
upon which grace and mercy still attend 
to intercede between he and his justice 
and since the law allow as much to i 
as she can challenge let the mild sentence 
which best become a mother and a queen 
now overcome nor let your wisdom suffer 
in do right to she I in my wrong 
endure a second ravishment 

you can free he 
only from that which do concern yourself 
not from the punishment that be due to i 
your injury you may forgive not i 
I plead my own just wreak which will right both 
where that which you desire rob i of justice 
it be that which I appeal to 

bloody woman 
do thou desire his punishment let he live then 
for any man to marry where he like not 
be still a linger torment 

for one rape 
one death be sufficient that way can catch i 

to you I fly then to your mercy madam 
exempt not your justice be but equal 
and since in no regard I come behind she 
let i not so be undervalue in 
your highness favour that the world take notice 
you so prefer she that in her behalf 
you kill that son you will not save for i 
mercy oh mercy madam 

great queen justice 

with what a masculine constancy the grave lady have hear they both 

yet how unmoved she sit 
in that which most concern she 

now she rise 
and have well weigh both their argument 
resolve to speak 

and yet again she pause 
oh Conon such a resolution once 
a roman tell i he have see in Cato 
before he kill himself 

it be now determine 
Merione I can wish I be no queen 
to give you satisfaction no mother 
Beliza to content you and will part 
even with my be both might have their wish 
but since that be impossible in few word 
I will deliver what I be resolve on 
the end for which all profitable law 
be make look two way only the reward 
of innocent good man and the punishment 
of bad delinquent we concern rape 
provide that same latter clause of marriage 
for he that have fall once not then foresee 
mankind can prove so monstrous to tread twice 
a path so horrid the great lawgiver 
Draco that for his strange severity 
be say to write his stern decree in blood 
make none for parricide presume that 
no man can be so wicked such may be 
Lycurgus answer do he live for this 
but since I find that in my son which be not 
doubt in any else I will add to it 
he can marry both but for both die 
both have their full revenge you see Beliza 
you have your wish with you Merione 
I will spend a tear or two so heaven forgive thou 

upon my knee I do approve your judgement 
and beg that you will put it into act 
with all speed possible only that I may 
have already make peace with myself 
part so with all the world princely Agenor 
I ask your pardon you my lord Euphanes 
and Crates with the rest too I forgive you 
do you the like for i you gracious mother 
I dare not ask and yet if that my death 
be like a son of you though my life be not 
perhaps you may vouchsafe it last that 
both these who I have wrong may wish my ash 
no heavy burden ere I suffer death 
for the restore of Meriones honour 
let i be marry to she and then die 
for you Beliza 

thou have make in this 
part of amends to i and to the world 
thy suit be grant call a flamen forth 
to do this holy work with he a headsman 
raise up thy weep eye Merione 
with this hand I confirm thy marriage 
wish that now the god will show some miracle 
that this may not divorce it 

to that purpose 
I be their minister stand not amaze 
to all your comfort I will do this wonder 
your majesty with your pardon I must speak it 
allow once heretofore of such a contract 
which you repent afterward revoke it 
be full bend to match she with Agenor 
the grieve prince know this and yet not dare 
to cross what you determine by a oath 
bind i and these his follower to do something 
that he may once enjoy she we swear to it 
and easy persuade be assure 
she be his wife before the face of heaven 
although some ceremonious form be want 
commit the first rape and bring she to he 
which break the marriage but when we perceive 
he purpose to abuse our ready service 
in the same kind upon the chaste Beliza 
hold ourselves less tie to he then goodness 
I make discovery of it to my brother 
who can relate the rest 

it be most true 

I will it be 

in every circumstance 
it be upon my soul for this know to i 
I win Merione in my lady habit 
to be again but willing surprise 
but with Agenor and her noble brother 
with my approve friend Conon with such speed 
she be pursue that the lewd act scarce end 
the prince assure he have enjoy Beliza 
for all the time Meriones face be cover 
be apprehend and bring to your presence 
but not till now discover in respect 
I hope the imminent danger of the prince 
to which his loose unquenched heat have bring he 
be pursue unto the late trial 
will work in he compunction which it have do 
and these two lady in their feign contention 
to your delight I hope have serve as masker 
to their own nuptial 

my choice be worthy 
when first I look on thou as thou have order 
all shall be do and not the mean that 
play in this unexpected comedy 
but shall partake our bounty and my lord 
that with the rest you may seem satisfy 
if you dare venture on a queen not yet 
so far in debt to year but that she may 
bring you a lusty boy I offer up 
myself and kingdom during my life to you 

it be a blessing which I dare not hope for 
but with all joy receive 

we all applaud it 

then on unto the temple where the right 
of marriage end we will find new delight exeunt
