our best prayer wait 
upon your fortune exeunt Cred 

for yourselves not he 

thou can not blame they I be in their debt 

but have your large expense a part whereof 
you owe they for unprofitable silk 
and lace be bestow among the poor 
that will have pray the right way for you 
not upon you 

for unprofitable silk 
and lace now believe i honest boy 
thou have hit upon a reprehension that belong 
unto i 

by my lord 
I have not so unmannerly a thought 
to reprehend you 

why I love thou for it 
Mine own acknowledgement confirm thy word 
for once I do remember come from 
the mercer where my purse have spend itself 
on those unprofitable toy thou speak of 
a man half naked with his poverty 
do meet i and request my relief 
I want whence to give it yet his eye 
speak for he those I can have satisfy 
with some unfruitful sorrow if my tear 
will not have add rather to his grief 
then ease it but the true compassion that 
I shall have give I have not this begin 
to make i think how many such man want 
the vain superfluous cost I wear upon 
my outside will have clothe and leave myself 
a habit as become to increase 
this new consideration there come one 
clad in a garment plain and thrifty yet 
as decent as these fair dear folly make 
as if it be of purpose to despise 
the vanity of show he purse have still 
the power to do a charitable deed 
and do it 

yet your inclination sir 
deserve no less to be commend than his action 

prithee do not flatter i 
he that intend well yet deprive himself 
of mean to put his good thought into deed 
deceive his purpose of the due reward 
that goodness merit oh antiquity 
thy great example of nobility 
be out of imitation or at least 
so lame follow that thou be as much 
before this age in virtue as in time 

sir it must needs be lame follow when 
the chief man love to follow it 
be for the most part cripple 

who be they 

soldier my lord soldier 

it be true duboy but if the law disable i no more 
for noble action then good purpose 
I will practice how to exercise the worth 
commend to we by our ancestor 
the poor neglect soldier shall command 
i from a lady courtship and the form 
I will study shall no more be teach i by 
the tailor but the scholar that expense 
which hitherto have be to entertain 
the intemperate pride and pleasure of the taste 
shall fill my table more to satisfy 
and less to surfeit 
what a honest work it will be when we find 
a virgin in her poverty and youth 
incline to be tempt to employ 
as much persuasion and as much expense 
to keep she upright as man use to do upon she fall 

it be charity that many maid will be unthankful for 
and some will rather take it for a wrong 
to buy they out of their inheritance 
the thing that they be bear to 

Longueville thou bring a cheerful promise in thy face 
there stand no pale report upon thy cheek 
to give i fear or knowledge of my loss it be red and lively 
how proceed my suit 

that be with labour sir a labour that to those of Hercules 
may add another or at least be call 
a imitation of this burn shirt 
for it be a pain of that unmerciful 
perplexity to shoulder through the throng 
of people that attend your success 
my sweaty linen fix upon my skin 
still as they pull i take that with it it be 
a fear I shall have leave my flesh among they 
yet I be patient for methinks the toil 
may be a emblem of the difficult 
and weary passage to get out of law 
and to make up the dear similitude 
when I be forth seek my handkercher 
to wipe my sweat off I do find a cause 
to make i sweat more for my purse be lose 
among their finger 

there it be rather find 

by they 

I mean so 

well I will restore 
thy damage to thou how proceed my suit 

like one at broker I think forfeit 
your promise council at the first 
put strong forward with a labour speed 
and such a violence of plead that 
his fee in sugarcandy scarce will make 
his throat a satisfaction for the hurt 
he do it and he carry the whole cause 
before he with so clear a passage that 
the people in the favour of your side 
cry Montague Montague in the spite of he 
that cry out silence and begin to laugh 
your adversary advocate to scorn 
who like a cunning footman set i forth 
with such a temperate easy kind of course 
to put he into exercise of strength 
and follow his advantage so close 
that when your hot mouth pleader think have win 
before he reach it he be out of breath 
and then the other strip he 

so all be lose 

but how I know not for methinks I stand 
confound with the clamour of the court 
like one embark upon a storm at sea 
where the tempestuous noise of thunder mix 
with roar of the billow and the thick 
imperfect language of the seaman take 
his understanding and his safety both 
together from he 

thou do bring ill news 

of what I be unwilling to have be 
the first reporter 

do observe no more 

at least not better 

then the be not inform 
so well as I be I can tell thou that 
will please thou for when all else leave my cause 
my very adversary take my part 

whosoever tell you that abuse you 

credit i he take my part 
when all forsake i 

take it from you 

yes I mean so and I think he have just cause 
to take it when the verdict give it he 

his spirit will have sink he ere he can 
have carry a ill fortune of this weight so light 

Nothing be a misery unless our weakness apprehend it so 
we can be more faithful to ourselves 
in any thing that be manly than to make 
ill fortune as contemptible to we 
as it make we to other 

here come they 
who very countenance will tell you how 
contemptible it be to other

witch how prithee 

thus the band will all turn witch to revenge 
themselves upon we and the woman that 
come to we for disguise must wear beard 
and that be they say a token of a witch 

what shall we then do 

we must study on it 
with more consideration stay duboye

of some frequent tavern or such a place 
of common notice to perform it in 
by way of undertake to maintain 
the several honour of those enemy 
thou for the lord of orleanes I for Amiens 

I like the project and I think it will take 
the better since their difference first do rise 
from his occasion who we follow once 

we can hope less after the report 
than entertainment or gratuity 
yet those be end I do not aim at most 
great spirit that be needy and will thrive 
must labour while such trouble be alive exeunt

though you have cut the throat of all the catchpole 
in France nay in the world 

I will be loath 
to be a burden or feed like a drone 
on the industrious labour of a bee 
and base far I hold it to owe for 
the bread I eat what be not in i to pay 
then since my full fortune be decline 
to their low ebb I will fashion my high mind

of this disguise boy out I ever trust 
it be a woman and how happy 
I have find it so and for myself I be sure 
one that will offer i a thousand pound now 
and that be a pretty sum to make one stagger 
in ready gold for this concealment can not 
buy my hope of she she be a dainty wench 
and such a one I find I want extreme 
to bring i into credit beauty do it 

say we shall all meach here and stay the feast now what can the worst be we have play the knave that be without question 

true and as I take it this be the first truth 
we tell these ten year and for any thing 
I know may be the last but grant we be knave 
both base and beastly knave 

Say so then 

well 

and likewise let it be consider we have wrong 
and most malicious this gentlewoman 
we cast to stay with what must we expect now 

i there be the point we will expect good eat 

I know we will but we may find good beat 

you say true gentleman and by 
though I love meat as well as any man 
I care not what he be if he eat a god name 
such crabsauce to my meat will turn my palate 

there be all the hazard for the freeze Montague 
have now get spring again and warmth in he 
and without doubt dare beat we terrible 
for not to mint the matter we be coward 
and have and shall be beat when man please 
to call we into cudgel 

I feel we be very prone that way 

the son of Adam 

now here then rest the state of the question 
whether we yield our body for a dinner 
to a sound dogwhip for I promise you 
if man be give to correction 
we can expect no less or quiet 
take a hard egg or two and ten mile hence 
bait in a ditch this we may do secure 
for to stay here about will be all one 
if once our moral mischief come in memory 

but pray you hear i be not this the day 
the virgin lady do elect her husband 

the dinner be to that end 

very well then say we all stay and say we all escape this whip and be well entertain and one of we carry the lady 

it be a seemly say I must confess but if we stay how fit 
we may apply it to ourselves in the end 
will ask a christian fear I can see 
if I say true what special ornament 
of art or nature lay aside our lie 
whore and drink which be no great virtue 
we be endue withal to win this lady 

yet woman go not by the best part ever that I have find direct 

why shall we fear then they choose man 
as they feed some time they settle 
upon a white brothe face a sweet smooth gallant 
and he they make a end of in a night 
sometime a goose sometime a gross meat 
a rump of beef will serve they at some season 
and fill their belly too though without doubt 
they be great devourer stock fish be a dish 
if it be well dress for the tufnesse sake 
will make the proud of they long and leap for it 
they will run mad for a pudding ere they will starve 

for my own part I care not come what can come 
if I be whip why so be it if cudgel 
I hope I shall out live it I be sure 
it be not the hundred time I have be serve so 
and yet I thank God I be here 

here be resolution 

a little patience and a rot apple 
cure twenty worse disease what say you sir 

marry I say sir if I have be acquaint 
with lamb in my youth as you have be 
with whip and such benefit of nature 
I shall do better as I be I will venture 
and if it be my luck to have the lady 
I will use my fortune modest if beat 
you shall not hear a word one I be sure of 
and if the worst fall she shall be my physic 
let we go then and a merry wind be with we 

captain your shoe be old pray put they off 
and let one fling they after we be bold sir 
and howosever our fortune fall let we bear 
a equal burden if there be a odd lash
