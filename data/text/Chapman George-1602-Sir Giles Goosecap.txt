you mistake we not sir 

this captain Foulweather alias commendation Will be the gallant that will needs be a suitor to our countess 

faith and if Foulweather be a welcome suitor to a fair lady have good luck

a southern man I think 

as fearful as a hare and he will lie like a lapwing and I know how he come to be a captain and to have his surname of commendation 

how I prithee will 

why sir he serve the great lady Kingcob and be yeoman of her wardrobe and because he can brush up her silk lusty she think he will curry the enemy coat as sound and so by her commendation he be make captain in the low country 

then be make captain only by his lady commendation without any worth also of his own he be ever after surname captain commendation

what be those two knight name that be thy captain comrade and within at supper with our lady 

one of their name sir be sir Gyles Goosecap the other sir cut rudesby

a northern man or a Westernman I take he but my captain be the emphatical man and by that pretty word emphatical you shall partly know he for it be a very forcible word in troth and yet he force it too much by his favour marry no more than he do all the rest of his word with who multiplicity often time he travail himself out of all good company 

like enough he travail for nothing else 

but what quality haunt sir Gyles Goosecap now sir 

sir Gyles Goosecap have always a death head as it be in his mouth for his only one reason for every thing be because we be all mortal and therefore he be general call the mortal knight then have he another pretty phrase too and that be he will tickle the vanity of it still in every thing and this be your summa totalis of both their virtue 

it be enough it be enough as long as they have land enough but now muster your third person afore we I beseech you 

the third person and second knight blunt sir cut rudesby be indeed blunt at a sharp wit and sharp at a blunt wit a good bustle gallant talk well at rover he be two part soldier as slovenly as a Swisser and somewhat like one in face too for he wear a bush beard will dead a cannon shoot better than a woolpack he will come into the presence like your Frenchman in foul boot and dare eat garlic as a preparative to his courtship you shall know more of he hereafter but good wag let i win you now for the geographical part of your lady in requital

who power to enjoy his object may so mask 
the judge part that in her radiant eye 
his estimation of the world may seem 
upright and worthy I have choose love 
to blind my reason with his misty hand 
and make my estimative power believe

and far above the pitch of my low plume 
I be your bold and constant guest my lord 

far far from bold for thou have know i long 
almost these twenty year and half those year 
have be my bedfellow long time before 
this unseen thing this thing of nought indeed 
or atom call my lordship shine in i 
and yet thou make thy self as little bold 
to take such kindness as become the age 
and truth of our indissoluble love 
as our acquaintance spring but yesterday 
such be thy gentle and too tender spirit 

my lord my want of courtship make i fear 
I shall be rude and this my mean estate 
meet with such envy and detraction 
such misconstruction and resolve misdoom 
of my poor worth that shall I be advance 
beyond my unseen lowness but one hair 
I shall be tear in piece with the spirit 
that fly in illlunged tempest through the world 
tear the head of virtue from her shoulder 
if she but look out of the ground of glory 
betwixt who and i and every worldly fortune 
there fight such sour and curse antipathy 
so waspish and so petulant a star 
that all thing tend to my grace or good 
be ravish from their object as I be 
a thing create for a wilderness 
and must not think of any place with man 

o hark you sir this wayward mood of you must sift be or rather root out you will no more music sir 

not now my lord 

begin my master then to bed to bed 

I thank you honest friend 

hence with this book and now monsieur Clarence methinks plain and prose friendship will do excellent well betwixt we come thus sir or rather thus come sir it be time I trow that we both live like one body thus and that both our side be slit and concorporate with organ fit to effect a individual passage even for out very thought suppose we be one body now and I charge you believe it where of I be the heart and you the liver 

your lordship may well make that division if you know the plain song 

o sir and why so I pray 

first because the heart be the more worthy entrail be the first that be bear and move and the last that move and die and then be the fountain of heat too for wheresoever our heat do not flow direct from the heart to the other organ there their action must of necessity cease and so without you I neither will nor can live 

well sir for these reason I may be the heart why may you be the liver now 

I be more than ashamed to tell you that my lord 

nay nay be not too suspicious of my judgement in you I beseech you ashamed friend if your love overcome not that shame a shame take that love I say Come sir why may you be the liver 

the plain and short truth be my lord because I be all liver and turn lover 

lover 

lover i'faith my lord 

now I prithee let i leap out of my skin for joy why thou will not now revive the sociable mirth of thy sweet disposition will thou shine in the world a new and make those that have slight thy love with the austerity of thy knowledge dote on the again with thy command shaft of their humour 

a alas my lord they be all far out of my aim and only to fit myself a little better to your friendship have I give these wilful reins to my affection 

And i'faith be my sour friend to all worldly desire overtake with the heart of the world love I shall be monstrous proud now to hear she be every way a most rare woman that I know thy spirit and judgement have choose be she wise be she noble be she capable of thy virtue will she kiss this forehead with judicial lip where somuch judgement and virtue deserve it Come brother twin be short I charge you and name i the woman 

since your lordship will shorten the length of my folly relation the woman that I so passionate love be no worse lady than your own niece the too worthy countess Eugenia 

why so so so you be a worthy friend be you not to conceal this lovemine in your head and will not open it to your heart now beshrew my heart if my heart dance not for joy though my heel do not and they do not because I will not set that at my heel that my friend set at his heart what friend and nephew both nephe be a far inferior title to friend I confess but I will prefer the backward as many friend do and leave their friend worse than they find they 

but my noble Lo it be almost a prodigy that I be only a poor gentleman and far short of that state and wealth that a lady of her greatness in both will expect in her husband 

hold thy doubt friend never fear any woman unless thyself be make of straw or some such dry matter and she of lightning audacity prosper above probability in all worldly matter do not thou know that fortune govern they without order and therefore reason the mother of order be none of her counsel why shall a man desire to aspire a unreasonable creature which be a woman seek her fruition by reasonable mean because thyself bind upon reason will thou look for congruity in a woman why there be not one woman among one thousand but will speak false latin and break Priscian head attempt nothing that you may with great reason doubt of and out of doubt you shall obtain nothing I tell thou friend the eminent confidence of strong spirit be the only witchcraft of this world spirit wrestle with spirit as body with body this be enough to make the hope well if she be one of these paint community that be ravish with coach and upper hand and brave man of dirt but thou know friend she be a good scholar and like enough to bite at the right reason and reason evermore ad optima hortetur to like that which be best not that which be brave or right or great and so consequent worst but prove what she can we will turn she and wind she and make she so pliant that we will draw she through a wedding ring i'faith

non illo melior quisquam nec amantior aequi 
vir fuit aut illa reverentior ulla dearum

be this the wondrous fortune you presage 
what man may miserable woman trust 

o peace good lady I come not to ravish you to any thing but now I see how you accept my motion I perceive how upon true trial you esteem i have I ride all this Circuit to levy the power of your judgement that I may not prove their strength too sudden with so violent a charge and do they fight it out in white blood and show i their heart in the soft crystal of tear 

o uncle you have wound yourself in charge i that I shall shun judgement as a monster if it will not weep I place the poor felicity of this world in a worthy friend and to see he so unworthy revolt I shed not the tear of my brain but the tear of my soul and if ever nature make tear the effect of any worthy cause I be sure I now shed they worthy

which yet will not maintain he a week such kind of nobleness give no coat of honour nor can scarce get a coat for necessity 

then be it not substantial knowledge as it be in he but verbal and fantastical for omnia in illa ille complexu tenet 

why seek he i then 

to make you joint partner with he in all thing and there be but a little partial difference betwixt you that hinder that universal jointure the bigness of this circle hold too near our eye keep it from the whole sphere of the sun but can we sustain it indifferent betwixt we and it it will then without check of one beam appear in his fullness

sing good Horatio while I sigh and write 
accord to my master Plato mind 
the soul be music and do therefore joy 
in accent musical which he that hate 
with point of discord be together tie 
and bark at reason consonant in sense 
divine Eugenia bear the ocular form 
of music and of reason and present 
the soul exempt from flesh in flesh inflame 
who must not love she then that love his soul 
to she I write my friend the star of friend 
will needs have my strange line greet her strange eye 
and for his sake I will pour my poor soul forth 
in flood of ink but do not his kind hand 
bar i with violent grace I will consume 
in the white flame of her impassionate love 
ere my harsh lip shall vent the odorous blaze 
for I be desperate of all worldly joy 
and there be never man so harsh to man 
when I be full of digest life 
I seem a liveless embryo to all 
each day rack up in nightlike funeral 
sing good Horatio while I sigh and write 

fie for shame 
I never hear of such a antedame 
do woman bring no help of soul to man 
why friend they either be man soul themselves 
or the most witty Imitatrix of they 
or pretty sweet ape of human soul 
that ever nature frame as I will prove 
for first they be substantiae lucidae 
and pure than man body like their soul 
which man harsh hair both of their breast and chin 
occasion by their gross and rude heat 
plain demonstrate then like soul they do 
movere corpora for no power on earth 
move a man body as a woman do 
then do they dare formas corpori 
or add fair form to man as their soul do 
for but for woman who wood care for form 
I vow I never will wash face nor hand 
nor care how ragged or slovenly I go 
Be it not for woman who of all man pomp 
be the true final cause then they make 
man in their seed immortal like their soul 
that else will perish in a span of time 
o they be soullikecreature and my niece 
the soul of twenty rare soul style in one 

that that it be my lord that make i love 

o be you come sir welcome to my niece 
as I may say at midnight gentle friend 
what have you write I pray 

strange stuff my lord he read and comment 

Indeed the way to believe be to love 
and the right way to love be to believe 
this I will carry now with pen and ink 
for she to use in answer see sweet friend 
she shall not stay to call but while the steel 
of her affection be make soft and hot 
I will strike and take occasion by the brow 
bless be the woo that be not long a do 

have ever man so true and noble friend 
or wood man think this sharp world freeze air 
to all true honour and judicial love 
wood suffer such a flourish pine in both 
to overlook the boxtree of this time 
when the learn mind have by impulsion wrought 
her eye clear fire into a know flame 
no elemental smoke can darken it 
nor northern coldness nip her daphnean flower 
oh sacred friendship thank to thy kind power 
that be retire from all the faithless world 
appear to i in my unworldly friend 
and for thy own sake let his noble mind 
by move precedent to all his kind 
like just Deucalion of earth stony bone 
repair the world with humane blood and flesh 
and die virtue with new life refresh

how now my friend do not the know beam 
that through thy common sense glance through thy eye 
to read that letter through thy eye retire 
and warm thy heart with a triumphant fire 

my lord I feel a treble happiness 
mix in one soul which prove how eminent 
thing endless be above thing temporal 
that be in body needful confine 
I can suffer their dimension pierce 
where my immortal part admit expansure 
even to the comprehension of two more 
commix substantial with her mere self 

as how my strange and riddlespeaking friend 

as thus my lord I feel my own mind joy 
as it be separate from all other power 
and then the mixture of another soul 
join in direction to one end like it 
and three the contentment I enjoy 
as we be join that I shall work that good 
in such a noble spirit as your niece 
which in myself I feel for absolute 
each good mind double his own free content 
when in another use they give it vent 

say like my friend and that I may not wrong 
thy full perfection with a empty grace 
then that which show present to thy conceit 
in work thou a wife worse than she seem 
I will tell thou plain a secret which I know 
my niece do use to paint herself with white 
who cheek be natural mix with red 
either because she think palelook move most 
or of a answerable nice affect 
to other of her modest quality 
because she will not with the outward blaze 
of tempt beauty tangle wanton eye 
and so be trouble with their trompery 
which construe as thou will I make it know 
that thy free comment may examine it 
as willing to tell truth of my niece 
then in the least degree to wrong my friend 

a jealous part of friendship you unfold 
for be it ever see that any dame 
will change of choice a well mix white and red 
for bloodless paleness if she strive to move 
her paint then be to shun motion 
but if she mend some defect with it 
breed it more hate than other ornament 
which to supply bare nature lady wear 
what a absurd thing be it to suppose 
if nature make we either lame or sick 
we will not seek for sound limb or for health 
by art the rector of confuse nature 
so in a face if nature be make lame 
than art can make it be it more offence 
to help her want there then in other limb 
who can give instance where dame face lose 
the privilege their other part may boast 

but our most court receive poet say 
that paint be pure chastity abator 

that be to make up a poor rhyme to nature 
and far from any judgement it confer 
for lightness come from heart and not from look 
and if inchastity possess the heart 
not paint do not raze it nor be clear 
do paint spot it 
omne bonum naturaliter pulchrum 
for outward fairness bear the divine form 
and move beholder to the act of love 
and that which move to love be to be wish 
and each thing simple to be wish be good 
so I conclude mere paint of the face 
a lawful and a commendable grace 

what paradox do thou defend in this 
and yet through thy clear argument I see 
thy speech be far exempt from flattery 
and how illiterate custom gross err 
almost in all tradition she prefer 
since then the doubt I put thou of my niece 
check not thy doubtless love forth my dear friend 
and to all force to those impression 
that now have carve her fantasy with love 
I have invite she to supper here 
And tell she thou be most extreme sick 
which thou shall counterfeit with all thy skill 

which be exceed small to counterfeit 

practice a little love will teach it thou 
and then shall doctor Versey the physician 
come to thou while herself be in my house 
with who as thou confer of thy disease 
I will bring my niece with all the lord and lady 
within your hear under feign pretext 
to show the picture that hang near thy chamber 
where when thou hear my voice know she be there 
and therefore speak that which may stir her thought 
and make she fly into thy open arm 
lady who true worth can move to ruth 
true lover must deceive to show their truth

alas poor gentleman good my lord let we see he 

thank gentle lady but my friend be loath 
to trouble lady since he can quit they 
with any thing he have that they respect 

respect my lord I will hold such a man 
in more respect than any emperor 
for he can make i empress of myself 
and in my own rule comprehend the world 

how now young dame what so inspire 
this speech have silver hair and reverence ask 
and soon shall have duty do of i 
then any pomp in temporal empery 

good madam get my lord to let we greet he 

Alas we shall but wrong and trouble he 
his contemplation greet he with most welcome 

I never know a man of so sweet a temper 
so soft and humble of so high a spirit 

alas my noble lord he be not rich 
nor title have nor in his tender cheek 
the stand lake of impudence corrupt 
have nought in all the world nor nought will have 
to grace he in the prostitute light 
but if a man will consort with a soul 
where all man sea of gall and bitterness 
be quite evaporate with her holy flame 
and in who power a dovelike innocence 
foster her own desert and life and death 
run hand in hand before they all the sky 
clear and transparent to her pierce eye 
than wood my friend be something but till then 
a cipher nothing or the worst of man 

sweet lord let we go visit he 

pray good my lord what be that you talk on 

be you come from your necessary business sir Gyles we talk of the visit of my sick friend Clarence 

o good my lord let we visit he cause I know his brother 

know his brother nay then count do not deny he 

pray my lord whether be elder he or his elder brother 

o the young brother elder while you live sir Gyles 

I say so still my lord but I be so bear down with truth as never any knight in the world be I think 

a man will think he speak simple now but indeed it be in the will of the parent to make which child they will young or elder for often we see the young inherit wherein he be elder 

your logical wit my lord be able to make any thing good 

well come sweet lord and lady let we spend 
the time till suppertime with some such sight 
as my poor house be furnish withal 
picture and jewel of which implement 
it may be I have some will please you much 

sweet lord let we see they 

I think your disease sir be rather of the mind then the body 

be there disease of the mind doctor 

no question sir even as there be of the body 

And cure for they too 

And cure for they too but not by physic 

you will have their disease grief will you not 

yes oftentimes 

and do not grief ever rise out of passion 

evermore 

and do not passion proceed from corporal distemper 

not the passion of the mind for the mind many time be sick when the body be healthful 

but be not the mindssickness of power to make the body sick 

in time certain 

and the body ill affection able to infect the mind 

no question 

then if there be such a natural commerce of power betwixt they that the ill estate of the one offend the other why shall not the medicine for one cure the other 

yet it will not you see heimihi quod nullus amor est medicabilis herbis 

nay then doctor since you can make any reasonable connexion of these two contrariety the mind and the body make both subject to passion wherein you confound the substance of both I must tell you there be no disease of the mind but one and that be ignorance 

why what be love be not that a disease of the mind 

nothing so for it spring natural out of the blood nor be we subject to any disease or sorrow who cause or effect simple and native concern the body that the mind by any mean partake nor be there any passion in the soul for where there be no affection there be no passion and affectus your master Galen refer part irascent for illic est anima sentiens ubi sunt affectus therefore the rational soul can be there also 

but you know we use to say my mind give i this or that even in those addiction that concern the body 

we use to say so indeed and from that use come the abuse of all knowledge and her practice for when the object in question only concern the state of the body why shall the soul be sorry or glad for it if she willing mix herself than she be a fool if of necessity and against her will a slave and so far from that wisdom and freedom that the empress of reason and a eternal substance shall comprehend 

divine speak sir but very paradoxical 

who be there 
ay my lord 

bring hither the key of the gallery methinks I hear the doctor and my friend 

I do so sure 

peace then a while my lord 
we will be bold to eavesdrop for I know 
my friend be as respective in his chamber 
and by himself of any thing he do 
as in a critic synod curious eye 
follow therein Pythagoras golden rule 
maximè omnium teipsum reverere 

know you the countess Eugenia sir 

exceed well sir she be a good learned scholar 

then I perceive you know she well indeed 

methinks you two shall use much conference 

Alas sir we do very seldom meet 
for her estate and i be so unequal 
and then her knowledge pass i so far 
that I hold much to sacred a respect 
of her high virtue to let my attend they 

pardon i sir this humbleness can flow 
out of your judgement but from passion 

Indeed I do account that passion 
the very high perfection of my mind 
that be excite by her excellence 
and therefore willing and glad feel it 
for what be speak of the most chaste queen 
of rich Pasiaca may be say of she 
anteuenit sortem moribus virtutibus annos 
Sexum animo morum nobilitate genus 

a most excellent distich 

Come lord away let we not presume too much 
of a good nature not for all I have 
wood I have he take knowledge of the wrong 
I rude offer he come then I will show 
a few rare jewel to your honour eye 
and then present you with a common supper 

jewel my lord why be not this candlestick one of your jewel pray 

yes mar be it sir Gyles if you will 

it be a most fine candlestick in truth it want nothing but the language 

the language servant why the language 

why mistress there be a Latin candlestick here afore and that have the language I be sure 

I think he have a reason for it lady 

I and a reason of the sun too my lord for his father will have be ashamed on it 

well master Clarence I perceive your mind 
have so incorporate itself with flesh 
and therein ratify that flesh to spirit 
that you have need of no physician help 
but good sir even for holy virtue health 
and grace of perfect knowledge do not make 
those groundwork of eternity you lay 
mean to your ruin and short be here 
for the too strict and rational course you hold 
will eat your body up and then the world 
or that small point of it where virtue live 
will suffer diminution it be now 
bring almost to a simple unity 
which be as you well know simplicior puncto 
and if that point fail once why then alas 
the unity must only be suppose 
let it not fail then most man else have sell it 
though you neglect yourself uphold it 
so with my reverend love I leave you sir 

thank worthy doctor I do ample quite you 
I prop poor virtue that be prop myself 
and only by one friend in all the world 
for virtue only sake I use this wile 
which otherwise I will despise and scorn 
the world shall sink and all the pomp she hug 
close in her heart in her ambitious gripe 
ere I sustain it if this slender joint 
move with the worth that worldling love so well 
have power to save it from the throat of hell 

Come on fair lady I must make you both
