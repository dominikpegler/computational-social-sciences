Timophanes my brother for who death 
I be taint in the world and foul taint 
in who remembrance I have ever wear 
in peace and war this livery of sorrow 
can witness for i how much I detest 
tyrannous usurpation with grief 
I must remember it for when no persuasion 
can win he to desist from his bad practice 
to change the aristocracy of Corinth 
into a absolute monarchy I choose rather 
to prove a pious and obedient son 
to my country my best mother than to lend 
assistance to Timophanes though my brother 
that like a tyrant strive to set his foot 
upon the city freedom 

it be a deed 
deserve rather trophy than reproof 

and will be still remember to your honour

this seat of justice or engage myself 
to fight for you abroad or to reform 
your state at home swear all upon my sword 
and call the god of Sicily to witness 
the oath you take that whatsoever I shall 
propound for safety of your commonwealth

the glass of servile flattery may behold 
the weak foundation upon which they build 
that trust in humane frailty happy be those 
that know in their birth they be subject to 
uncertain change be still prepare and arm 
for either fortune a rare principle 
and with much labour learn in wisdom school 
for as these bondman by their action show 
that their prosperity like too too large a sail 
for their small bark of judgement sink they with 
a foreright gale of liberty ere they reach 
the port they long to touch at so these wretch 
swell with the false opinion of their worth 
and proud of blessing leave they not acquire 
that do believe they can with giantarm 
fathom the earth and be above their fate 
those borrow help that do support they vanish 
fall of themselves and by unmanly suffer 
betray their proper weakness and make know 
their boast greatness be lend not their own 

o for some meat they sit long 

we forget 
when we draw out intemperate feast till midnight 
their hunger be not think on nor their watch 
nor do we hold ourselves serve to the height 
but when we do exact and force their duty 
beyond their strength and power 

we pay for it now 
I now can be content to have my head 
break with a rib of beef or for a coffin 
be bury in the drip pan

to stand upon your guard and leave your feast 
or but imagine what it be to be 
most miserable and rest assure you be so 
our master be victorious 

how 

within 
a day march of the city flesh with spoil 
and proud of conquest the Armado sink 
the carthaginian admiral hand to hand 
slay by Leosthenes 

I feel the whip 
upon my back already 

every man 
seek a convenient tree and hang himself 

better die once then live a age to suffer 
new torture every hour 

say we submit 
and yield we to their mercy 

can you flatter 
yourselves with such false hope or dare you think 
that you imperious lord that never fail 
to punish with severity petty slip 
in your neglect of labour may be win 
to pardon those licentious outrage 
which noble enemy forbear to practise 
upon the conquer what have you omit 
that may call on their just revenge with horror 
and study cruelty we have go too far 
to think now of retire in our courage 
and during lie our safety if you be not 
slave in your abject mind as in your fortune 
since to die be the worst better expose 
our naked breast to their keen sword and sell 
our life with the most advantage than to trust 
in a forestal remission or yield up 
our body to the furnace of their fury 
thrice heat with revenge 

you lead we on 

and it be but justice you shall bring we off 

and we expect it 

hear then and obey i 
and I will either save you or fall with you 
man the wall strong and make good the port 
bold deny their entrance and rip up 
your grievance and what compel you to 
this desperate course if they disdain to hear 
of composition we have in our power 
their age father child and their wife 
who to preserve themselves must willing 
make intercession for we it be not time now 
to talk but do a glorious end or freedom 
be now propose we stand resolve for either 
and like good fellow live or die together 

I be so far from envy I be proud 
you have outstrip i in the race of honour 
o it be a glorious day and brave win 
your bold performance give such lustre to 
Timoleon wise direction as the army 
rest doubtful to who they stand most engage 
for their so great success 

the god first honour 
the glory be the general it be far from i 
to be his rival 

you abuse your fortune 
to entertain her choice and gracious favour 
with a contract brow plume victory 
be true paint with a cheerful look 
equal distant from proud insolence 
and base dejection 

o Timagoras 
you only be acquaint with the cause 
that load my sad heart with a hill of lead 
who ponderous weight neither my new get honour 
assist by the general applause 
the soldier crown it with nor all war glory 
can lessen or remove and will you please 
with fit consideration to remember 
how much I wrong Cleora innocence 
with my rash doubt and what a grievous penance 
she do impose upon her tender sweetness 
to pluck away the vulture jealousy 
that feed upon my liver you can blame i 
but call it a fit justice on myself 
though I resolve to be a stranger to 
the thought of mirth or pleasure 

you have redeem 
the forfeit of your fault with such a ransom 
of honourable action as my sister 
must of necessity confess her suffering 
weigh down by your fair merit and when she view you 
like a triumphant conqueror carry through 
the street of Syracuse the glad people 
press to meet you and the senator 
contend who shall heap most honour on you 
the ox crown with garland lead before you 
appoint for the sacrifice and the altar 
smoke with thankful incense to the god 
the soldier chant loud hymn to your praise 
the window fill with matron and with virgin 
throw upon your head as you pass by 
the choice flower and silent invoke 
the queen of love with their particular vow 
to be think worthy of you can Cleora 
though in the glass of selflove she behold 
her best desert but with all joy acknowledge 
what she endure be but a noble trial 
you make of her affection and her anger 
rise from your too amorous ear soon drench 
in Lethe and forget 

if those glory 
you so set forth be i they may plead for i 
but I can lay no claim to the least honour 
which you with foul injustice ravish from she 
her beauty in i wrought a miracle 
teach i to aim at thing beyond my power 
which her perfection purchase and give to i 
from her free bounty she inspire i with 
that valour which I dare not call my own 
and from the fair reflection of her mind 
my soul receive the sparkle beam of courage 
Shee from the magazine of her proper goodness 
stock i with virtuous purpose send i forth 
to trade for honour and she be the owner 
of the bark of my adventure I must yield she 
a just account of all as fit a factor 
and howsoever other think i happy 
and cry aloud I have make a prosperous voyage 
one frown of her dislike at my return 
which as a punishment for my fault I look for 
strike dead all comfort 

tush these fear be needless 
she can must not shall not be so cruel 
a free confession of a fault win pardon 
but be second by desert command it 
the general be your own and sure my father 
repent his harshness for myself I be 
ever your creature one day shall be happy 
in your triumph and your marriage 

may it prove so 
with her consent and pardon 

ever touch 
on that harsh string she be your own and you 
without disturbance seize on what be your due 

she have her health then 

yes sir and as often 
as I speak of you lend attentive ear 
to all that I deliver nor seem tire 
though I dwell long on the relation of 
your suffering for she heap praise on praise 
on your unequalled temperance and command 
you hold over your affection 

to my wish 
have you acquaint she with the defeature 
of the carthaginian and with what honour 
Leosthenes come crown home with 

with all care 

and how do she receive it 

as I guess 
with a seem kind of joy but yet appear not 
transport or proud of his happy fortune 
but when I tell she of the certain ruin 
you must encounter with at their arrival 
in Syracuse and that death with torment 
must fall upon you which you yet repent not 
esteem it a glorious martyrdom 
and a reward of pure unspotted love 
preserve in the white robe of innocence 
though she be in your power and still spur on 
by insolent lust you rather choose to suffer 
the fruit untasted for who glad possession 
you have call on the fury of your lord 
then that she shall be grieve or taint in 
her reputation 

do it work compunction 
pity she my misfortune 

Shee express 
all sign of sorrow which her vow observe 
can witness a grieve heart at the first hear 
she fall upon her face rent her fair hair 
her hand hold up to heaven and vent sigh 
in which she silent seem to complain 
of heaven injustice 

it be enough wait careful 
and upon all watch occasion continue 
speech and discourse of i it be time must work she 

I will not be want but still strive to serve you

thou now be dead 

he be more a slave than fortune 
or misery can make i that insult 
upon unweaponed innocence 

prate you dog 

cur snap at lion in the toil who look 
fright they be free 

as a wild beast 
drive he before you 

oh divine Cleora 

dare thou presume to name she 

yes and love she 
and may say have deserve she 

stop his mouth exit guard with Pisander 
load he with iron too 

I be deadly sick 
to look on he 

if he get loose I know it 
I caper like a ape again I feel 
the whip already 

This go to my lady 

Come cheer you sir we will urge his punishment 
to the full satisfaction of your anger 

he be not worth my thought no corner leave 
in all the spacious room of my vex heart 
but be fill with Cleora and the rape 
she have do upon her honour with my wrong 
the heavy burden of my sorrow song 

thou be thy own disposer Were his honour 
and glory centuple as I must confess 
Leosthenes be most worthy yet I will not 
however I may counsel force affection 

it need not sir I prize he to his worth 
nay love he true yet will not live slave 
to his jealous humour since by the hope of heaven 
as I be free from violence in a thought 
I be not guilty 

it be believe Cleora 
and much the rather our great god be praise for it 
in that I find beyond my hope no sign 
of riot in my house but all thing order 
as if I have be present 

may that move you 
to pity poor Marullo 

it be my purpose 
to do he all the good I can Cleora 
but his offence be against the state 
must have a public trial in the mean time 
be careful of yourself and stand engage 
no far to Leosthenes than you may 
come off with honour for be once his wife 
you be no more your own nor i but must 
resolve to serve and suffer his command 
and not dispute they ere it be too late 
consider it due I must to the senate Exit Archida 

I be much distract in Leosthenes 
I can find nothing just to accuse 
but his excess of love which I have study 
to cure with more than common mean yet still 
it grow upon he and if I may call 
my suffering merit I stand bind to think on 
Marullo danger though I save his life 
his love be unrewarded I confess 
both have deserve i yet of force must be 
unjust to one such be my destiny enter Timandra 
how now whence flow these tear 

I have meet madam 
a object of such cruelty as will force 
a savage to compassion 

speak what be it 

Men pity beast of rapine if overmatch 
though bait for their pleasure but these monster 
upon a man that can make no resistance 
be senseless in their tyranny let it be grant 
Marullo be a slave he be still a man 
a capital offender yet in justice 
not to be torture till the judge pronounce 
his punishment 

where be he 

drag to prison 
with more than barbarous violence spurn and spit on 
by the insult officer his hand 
pinion behind his back load with fetter 
yet with a saintlike patience he still offer 
his face to their rude buffet 

o my grieve soul 
by who command 

it seem my lord your brother 
for he be a looker on and it take from 
honour Leosthenes to suffer it 
for his respect to you who name in vain 
the grieve wretch loud call on 

by Diana 
it be base in both and to their tooth I will tell they 
that I be wrong in it as go forth 

what will you do 

in person 
visit and comfort he 

that will bring fuel 
to the jealous fire which burn too hot already 
in lord Leosthenes 

let they consume he 
I be mistress of myself where cruelty reign 
there dwell nor love nor honour Exit Cleora 

So it work 
though hitherto I have run a desperate course 
to serve my brother purpose now it be fit enter Leosthenes and Timagoras 
I study my own end they come Assist i 
in these my undertake love great patron 
as my intent be honest 

it be my fault 
distrust from other spring Timagoras 
from diffidence in ourselves but I will strive 
with the assurance of my worth and merit 
to kill this monster jealousy 

it be a guest 
in wisdom never to be entertain 
on trivial probability but when 
he do appear in pregnant proof not fashion 
by idle doubt and fear to be receive 
they make their own horn that be too secure 
as well as such as give they growth and be 
from mere imagination though I prize 
Cleora honour equal with my own 
and know what large addition of power 
this match bring to our family I prefer 
our friendship and your peace of mind so far 
above my own respect or she that if 
she hold not her true value in the test 
it be far from my ambition for her cure 
that you shall wound yourself 

This argue for i 

why she shall be so passionate for a bondman 
fall not in compass of my understanding 
but for some near interest or he raise 
this mutiny if he love she as you say 
she do confess he do but to enjoy 
by fair or foul play what he venture for 
to i be a riddle 

pray you no more already 
I have answer that objection in my strong 
assurance of her virtue 

it be unfit then 
that I shall press it further 

now I must Timandra step out distract 
make in or all be lose 

what will Timandra 

how wild she look how be it with thy lady 

collect thyself and speak 

as you be noble 
have pity or love piety oh 

take breath 

out with it bold 

o the best of lady 
I fear be go for ever 

who Cleora 

deliver how 'sdeath be a man sir speak 

take it then in as many sigh as word 
my lady 

what of she 

no soon hear 
Marullo be imprison but she fall 
into a deadly swoon 

but she recover 
Say so or he will sink too hold sir fie 
this be unmanly 

bring again to life 
but with much labour she awhile stand silent 
yet in that interim vent sigh as if 
they labour from the prison of her flesh 
to give her grieve soul freedom on the sudden 
transport on the wing of rage and sorrow 
she fly out of the house and unattended 
enter the common prison 

This confirm 
what but before I fear 

there you may find she 
and if you love she as a sister 

damn she 

or you respect her safety as a lover 
procure Marullo liberty 

impudence 
beyond expression 

shall I be a bawd 
to her lust and my dishonour 

she will run mad else 
or do some violent act upon herself 
my lord her father sensible of her suffering 
labour to gain his freedom 

o the devil 
have she bewitch he too 

I will hear no more 
Come sir we will follow she and if no persuasion 
can make she take again her natural form 
which by lust powerful spell she have cast off 
this sword shall disenchant she 

o my heartstring exeunt Leost and Timagoras 

I know it will take pardon i fair Cleora 
though I appear a traitress which thou will do 
in pity of my woe when I make know 
my lawful claim and only seek my own Exit 

there be for your privacy stay unbind his hand 

I dare not madam 

I will buy thy danger 
take more gold do not trouble i with thanks 
I do suppose it do Exit jailor 

my better angel 
assume this shape to comfort i and wise 
since from the choice of all celestial figure 
he can not take a visible form so full 
of glorious sweetness kneel 

rise I be flesh and blood 
and do partake thy torture 

can it be 
that charity shall persuade you to descend 
so far from your own height as to vouchsafe 
to look upon my suffering how I bless 
my fetter now and stand engage to fortune 
for my captivity no my freedom rather 
for who dare think that place a prison which 
you sanctify with your presence or believe 
sorrow have power to use her sting on he 
that be in your compassion arm and make 
impregnable though tyranny raise at once 
all engine to assault he 

Indeed virtue 
with which you have make evident proof that you 
be strong fortify can fall though shake 
with the shock of fierce temptation but still triumph 
in spite of opposition for myself 
I may endeavour to confirm your goodness 
a sure retreat which never will deceive you 
and with unfeigned tear express my sorrow 
for what I can help 

do you weep for i 
o save that precious balm for noble use 
I be unworthy of the small drop 
which in your prodigality of pity 
you throw away on i ten of these pearl

from a consume plague or stop heaven vengeance 
call down by cry sin though at that instant 
in dreadful flash fall on the roof 
of bold blasphemer I be just punish 
for my intent of violence to such pureness 
and all the torment flesh be sensible of 
a soft and gentle penance 

which be end 
in this your free confession enter Leosthenes and Timagoras 

what a object 
have I encounter 

I be blast too

can I expire now 
these white and innocent hand close my eye thus 
it be not to die but in a heavenly dream 
to be transport without the help of Charon 
to the elysian shade you make i bold 
and but to wish such happiness I fear 
may give offence 

no for believe it Marullo

that happiness in my gift but you may challenge

from i a virgin bounty I will practise 
all art for your deliverance and that purchase 
in what concern your father aim I speak it 
do not despair but hope 

to have the hangman 
when he be marry to the cross in scorn 
to say god give you joy 

but look on i 
and be not too indulgent to your folly 
and then but that grief stop my speech imagine 
what language I shall use 

against thyself

So brother 
though you join in the dialogue to accuse i

I can in my defence allege such reason 
as my accuser shall stand dumb to hear they

for the preserver of my fame and honour 
and pray you sir in charity believe 
that since I have ability of speech 
my tongue have so much be enure to truth

I have rather fall under so just a judge 
then be acquit by a man corrupt 
and partial in his censure 

note his language

his present state dare promise 

I observe it 
place the fair lady in the midst that both 
look with covetous eye upon the prize 
they be to plead for may from the fair object 
teach Hermes eloquence 

be I fall so low 
my birth my honour and what be dear to i 
my love and witness of my love my service 
so undervalue that I must contend 
with one where my excess of glory must 
make his overthrow a conquest shall my fullness 
supply defect in such a thing that never 
know any thing but want and emptiness 
give he a name and keep it such from this 
unequal competition if my pride 
or any bold assurance of my worth 
have pluck this mountain of disgrace upon i 
I be just punish and submit but if 
I have be modest and esteem myself 
more injure in the tribute of the praise 
which no desert of i prize by selflove 
ever exact may this cause and minute 
for ever be forget I dwell long 
upon my anger and now turn to you 
ingrateful fair one and since you be such 
it be lawful for i to proclaim myself 
and what I have deserve 

neglect and scorn 
from i for this proud vaunt 

you nourish lady 
your own dishonour in this harsh reply 
and almost prove what some hold of your sex 
you be all make up of passion for if reason 
or judgement can find entertainment with you 
or that you will distinguish of the object 
you look on in a true glass not seduce 
by the false light of your too violent will 
I shall not need to plead for that which you 
with joy shall offer be my high birth a blemish 
or do my wealth which all the vain expense 
of woman can waste breed loathe in you 
the honour I can call my own thought scandal 
be I deform or for my father sin 
mulct by nature if you interpret these 
as crime it be fit I shall yield up myself 
most miserable guilty but perhaps 
which yet I will not credit you have see 
this gallant pitch the bar or bear a burden 
will crack the shoulder of a weak bondman 
or any other boisterous exercise 
assure a strong back to satisfy 
your loose desire insatiate as the grave 

you be foul mouth 

ill manner too 

I speak 
in the way of supposition and entreat you 
with all the fervour of a constant lover 
that you will free yourself from these aspersion 
or any imputation black tongue slander 
can throw on your unspotted virginwhiteness 
to which there be no easy way then by 
vouchsafe he your favour he to who 
next to the general and the god and fautor 
the country owe her safety 

be you stupid 
'slight leap into his arm and there ask pardon 
o you expect your slave reply no doubt 
we shall have a fine oration I will teach 
my spaniel to howl in sweet language 
and keep a better method 

you forget 
the dignity of the place 

silence 

speak bold 

it be your authority give i a tongue 
I shall be dumb else and I be secure 
I can clothe my thought and just defence 
in such a abject phrase but it will appear 
equal if not above my low condition 
I need no bombast language steal from such 
as make nobility from prodigious term 
the hearer understand not I bring with i 
no wealth to boast of neither can I number 
uncertain fortune favour with my merit 
I dare not force affection or presume 
to censure her discretion that look on i 
as a weak man and not her fancy idol 
how I have love and how much I have suffer 
and with what pleasure undergo the burden 
of my ambitious hope in aim at 
the glad possession of a happiness 
the abstract of all goodness in mankind 
can at no part deserve with my confession 
of my own want be all that can plead for i 
but if that pure desire not blend with 
foul thought that like a river keep his course 
retain still the clearness of the spring 
from whence it take beginning may be think 
worthy acceptance then I dare rise up 
and tell this gay man to his tooth I never 
dare doubt her constancy that like a rock 
beat off temptation as that mock the fury 
of the proud wave nor from my jealous fear 
question that goodness to which as a altar 
of all perfection he that true love 
shall rather bring a sacrifice of service 
then raze it with the engine of suspicion 
of which when he can wash a Aethiop white 
Leosthenes may hope to free himself 
but till then never 

bold presumptuous villain 

I will go far and make good upon he 
in the pride of all his honour birth and fortune 
he be more unworthy than myself 

thou lie 

confute he with a whip and the doubt decide 
punish he with a halter 

o the god 
my rib though make of brass can not contain 
my heart swell big with rage the lie whip pluck off his disguise 
let fury then disperse these cloud in which 
I long have mask disguise that when they know 
who they have injure they may faint with horror 
of my revenge which wretched man expect 
as sure as fate to suffer 

ha Pisander 

it be the bold theban 

there be no hope for i then 
I think I shall have put in for a share 
and bear Cleora from they both but now 
this stranger look so terrible that I dare not 
so much as look on she 

now as myself 
thy equal at thy best Leosthenes 
for you Timagoras praise heaven you be bear 
Cleora brother it be your safe armour 
but I lose time the base lie cast upon i 
I thus return thou be a perjure man 
false and perfidious and have make a tender 
of love and service to this lady when 
thy soul if thou have any can bear witness 
that thou be not thy own for proof of this 
look better on this virgin and consider 
this persian shape lay by and she appear 
in a greekish dress such as when first you see she 
if she resemble not Pisander sister 
one call Statilia 

it be the same my guilt 
so choke my spirit I can not deny 
my falsehood nor excuse it 

this be she 
to who thou be contract this the lady 
that when thou be my prisoner fair take 
in the spartan war that beg thy liberty 
and with it give herself to thou ungrateful 

no more sir I entreat you I perceive 
true sorrow in his look and a consent 
to make i reparation in my honour 
and then I be most happy 

the wrong do she 
draw i from Thebes with a full intent to kill thou 
but this fair object meet i in my fury 
and quite disarm more be deny to have she 
by you my lord Archidamus and not able 
to live far from she love the mistress of 
all quaint device prompt i to treat 
with a friend of i who as a pirate sell i 
for a slave to you my lord and give my sister 
as a present to Cleora 

strange meander 

there how I bear myself needs no relation 
but if so far descend from the height 
of my then flourish fortune to the low 
condition of a man to have mean only 
to feed my eye with the sight of what I honour 
the danger to I undergo the suffering 
the clearness of my interest may deserve 
a noble recompense in your lawful favour 
now it be apparent that Leosthenes 
can claim no interest in you you may please 
to think upon my service 

sir my want 
of power to satisfy so great a debt 
make i accuse my fortune but if that 
out of the bounty of your mind you think 
a free surrender of myself full payment 
I glad tender it 

with my consent to 
all injury forget 

I will study 
in my future service to deserve your favour 
and good opinion 

thus I glad fee kiss Statilia 
this advocate to plead for i 

you will find i 
a easy judge when I have yield reason 
of your bondman fall off from their obedience 
and after as you please determine of i 
I find their nature apt to mutiny 
from your too cruel usage and make trial 
how far they may be wrought on to instruct you 
to look with more prevention and care 
to what they may hereafter undertake 
upon the like occasion the hurt be little 
they have commit nor be ever ever 
but with some pain effect I confess 
in hope to force a grant of fair Cleora 
I urge they to defend the town against you 
nor have the terror of your whip but that 
I be prepare of defence elsewhere 
so soon get entrance in this I be guilty 
now as you please your censure 

bring they in 
and though you have give i power I do entreat 
such as have undergo their insolence 
it may not be offensive though I study 
pity more than revenge 

it will best become you 

I must consent 

for i I will find a time 
to be revenge hereafter 

give i leave 
I will speak for all 

what can thou say to hinder 
the course of justice 

Nothing you may see 
we be prepare for hang and confess 
we have deserve it our most humble suit be 
we may not twice be execute 

twice how mean thou 
at the gallow first and after in a ballad 
sing to some villainous tune there be tengroatrhymer 
about the town grow fat on these occasion 
let but a chapel fall or a street be fire 
a foolish lover hang himself for pure love 
or any such like accident and before 
they be cold in their grave some damn ditty be make 
which make their ghost walk let the state take order 
for the redress of this abuse record 
it be do by my advice and for my part 
I will cut as clean a caper from the ladder 
as ever merry greek do 

yet I think 
you will show more activity to delight 
your master for a pardon 

o I will dance caper 
as I be all air and fire 

and ever be 
obedient and humble 

as his spaniel 
though he kick i for exercise and the like 
I promise for all the rest 

Rise then you have it 

cease these clamour 
and now the war be end to our wish 
and such as go the pilgrimage of love 
happy in full fruition of their hope 
it be lawful thanks pay to the power divine 
to drown our care in honest mirth and wine exeunt
