have speak you so impartial worthy 
we shall do wrong to merit not grace you 
believe i sir you have injure much yourself 
vouchsafe familiarity with those 
man of so common rank as Dansiker 
your hope shall fly a pitch above they 

it may be that our clime stand not to give 
that full content the air you draw at home 
and therefore purpose short a return 

I know no country I can call home 
what by your courtesy I may my desert stand 
not to make promise of 

detract not from yourself call this your own 
I see there speak a fortune in your brow 
will make we proud to have acknowledge you 

I will gauge a thousand ducat on equal term 
I live to see he the sultan admiral 

why not as well as the great customer 
my ally kinsman governor neither bear Turk 

I dare not look so high yet be I employ 
what a poor christian can I dare make promise of 

Christian or Turk you be more wise I know 
then with religion to confine your hope 

he be too well read in poesy to be tie 
in the slave fetter of religion 
what difference in i as I be a Turk 
and be a christian life liberty 
wealth honour they be common unto all 
if any odds be it be on Mahomet side 
his seruit over thrive best I be sure 

be this the hook your golden bait do cover 

I have oft with laughter think how innocent 
my thought when first I turn be how scrupulous 
I be when with one argument I be confirm as thus 
if this religion be so damnable 
as other make it that God which owe the right 
profane by this will soon destroy it quite 

that be easy answer heaven be merciful 
by their destruction it shall take all mean 
from give possibility to their change 
and so unjust damn they but for my part 
it be not divinity but nature move i 
which do in beast force they to keep their kind 

but man that have two end safety and profit 
where beast no far be transport 
then with the present object must make their action 
turn to those point 

both which be in some sort propose to you 

as how 

as thus for profit you can with yourself 
imagine that your virtue can be smother 
may there but be assurance of your trust 

how shall I give you that Gou as we do turn Turk 

that be the way to more uncertainty 
man soon open foe then feign friend try 
and where man act from their own end proceed 
more look unto those end then like the deed 

this gudgeon will not bite 

but when there be example plentiful 
to instance against your word you need not fear 
man what they see oppose against what they hear 

the cunning fowler to beguile the bird 
bring up some tame and let they fly abroad 
to draw in other that their liberty 
may be the bait to other misery 
such be statepolicy sometimes to advance a ill 
when other for less crime it oft do kill 
but to cut off your further argument 
what be my of prowess or art shall rest by you 
to be dispose of but to abjure 
my name and the belief my ancestor 
leave to my being I do not love so well 
the earth that bear i to lessen my contempt 
and hatred to she by so much advantage 
so oblique act as this shall give to she 

work in my sister present 

you be yourself free nor will I further 
dissuade your resolution nor less esteem 
your merit and fair worth 

you engage i to you sir 

he enjoy too much by promise to be win 
it must be a woman act to who there be nought 
that be impossible what devil dare not move 
Men to accomplish woman work they to 
and see in happy time she be come we will single they 

here come a argument that will persuade 
a god turn mortal until I see her face 
I never know what man term beauty be 
beside who fair she have a mind so chaste 
a man may soon melt the Alps then she 

we will along with you when make she hence 

the wind sit fair the slave be send down 
who the next morn bear hence 

we will aboard with you fair sir we will leave 
our love exchange with you some happy time 
may perfect that good work I wish be i 

my true service nay lady stay 
though hitherto I have be a hapless orator 
your mild measure or my lovetaught tongue 
may find more fortunate hour for by that guide 
which rule and know our thought 

reserve your oath sir to more easy ear 
I understand myself too well to credit they 

ungentle maid to triumph in my torment 
if ever breast do feel the power of love 
or beauty make a conquest of poor man 
I be thy captive by heaven by my religion 

as my belief be in that my faith give trust 
to your protest 

then by thy god by the great Mahomet 

too weak a bond to tie a christian in 

what shall I swear by propose a oath to i 
the breach whereof will at once sink i low 
than hell know being I will take it willing 

I will be conceal no long know then I love 
but not the man who daily orison 
invoke confusion on i who religion 
speak i a infidel 

'Sheart I be of none only to feed discourse 
and fill up argument 

but you must be of one if you will enjoy i 
if then your thought answer to what you speak

hardhearted man glut thy relentless sight 
with fulleyed sorrow 

Shee be all amorous all fair that she do love 
behold those tear who drop will pierce the heart 
of tiger make they pitiful

his seat in beauty thou be a God to i 
my country friend nay being what will thou have 

to be no other than myself I crave 

I be no more my own rather than lose 
so true a happiness as thy constant love 
there be no way so black I will not prove
