you have deserve 
my life which ought to waste itself in service 

I be a honourer of your fair sister 
it rest in you to perfect my ambition 
and make she i 

how do you mean my lord 

now he be put to it she be Ursini mistress 
as he be Borgia he can have no 
pretence to oppose he if he discover 
and be Aurelio again he destroy all 
hope for himself for I perceive he be take with she 
I know by the motion of his nose which pant 
like the bellows of a organ 

sir your father 
voice speak in you you now command my destiny 
if you will make i happy 

noble sir 
I be sorry where such infinite merit plead 
I have no power to serve your noble wish 
and keep the honour of a gentleman 

your family I take it can receive 
no stain by my alliance 

it be a blessing 

how will he come off 

mistake not I beseech you 
I have already engage myself to a gentleman 
of a noble house in Milan one Aurelio 
Andreozzi 

that be himself 

who on the fight of 
her picture which I give he court i 
to woo the substance for he promise 
to follow i in person be one 
to who I have many obligation 
in the Milan court I paund the credit 
of a gentleman to assist his fair desire 
if in few day he come to Urbino but 
I be confident his young affection 
which have no other life but what a dead 
representation can infuse will soon 
vanish again and leave i to be serviceable 
in what you will command i and be sure 
I will not rack your patience too much length 
if in few day he appear not I will think 
my promise disoblige and direct all 
my ability to make your wish prosper 
it will become my gratitude 

you speak noble 

the pleasure of the court will so abate 
his thought this way that I presume your lordship 
will soon be master of that amorous province 
you aim at and much honour your poor servant 

let this confirm I be you 

so so this be indifferent well carry I be jealous 
of a more lame come off 

add this one 
to your other princely favour madam and 
admit this gentleman to kiss your hand 

without much suit my heart will have convey 
that to my lip a very handsome gentleman 

what say the duchess do not her eye fix 
upon my brother how now Cornelia 
I be his sister yet I have 
no acquaintance with this turbulent passion 
when I last see he 

what do her highness mean 
she speak to Ursini but her eye direct 
some language this way Borgia do observe 

and wonder but I see nothing in her eye 
to be afraid of 

if the duchess shall be in love with he 
here be a purchase I do very 
believe here will be a end of all our war 
if he have but the grace to march upon 
this service and charge home smile smile upon he 
well Aurelio Andreozzi it be very possible 
you may meet with your match if he mount she 
I will bring a ladder to his sister fort 
and then the town be our own she call he to she

and will not be the hateful stock of pastime 
to groom and page

nor do not think it possible it may be

as the wheel move we do think nothing less 
your son shall not be duke there be no fear on it 
while Ferrara live

so we say sleep quiet 

he shall not very peremptory 
you be no oracle will I be duchess 
for half a hour he shall be duke do you hear now 
no matter who repent I think you 
have be his friend he shall be a duke 
however I think on it it become not you 
to circumscribe his fortune he can number 
descent of noble blood and have his breed 
have none of the worst face head nor heart 
however you value he and discharge your bolt 
at random thus he shall 

hear we sir 

he shall not be a duke 

do not I say he be mad 

that be dissemble 
he have cause now to see a turn in the stream 
and Ferrara only hopeful with the duchess enter Pisauro and Ascanio 
what thing be that 

be he so confident 

he will lay about like a prince do you think 
we may present he safe if you say 
the word I will wind he up to a emperor 

Keep thy shape boy we will lose the sport 
and happy I will acquaint these gentleman 

if I 
shall be whip hearty for my conceit 
the little high German will not take it kind 
it may be the court largesse but no matter 
I have some gold and dare venture the last 
at any time for coin of this complexion 

be you in earnest 

it will be excellent 
and please her highness she have command 
all liberty of mirth I will undertake 
to prepare she 

about it then I will have 
my part in the interlude lose no time boy 
thou shall be prince of Pigmyland for this 
the duchess I will withdraw 

my lord you make i wonder challenge i 
of promise though I acknowledge it 
no act that can reflect with a dishonour 
upon our person yet we must not be 
so jest into marriage you be a prince 
of a unquestioned merit take not these 
imaginary way to advance your hope 
in we we be yet free as you my lord 
and shall not in a dream give up ourself 
be we dispose to marry or contract 
ourself the day shall witness it without 
a blush let guilty soul call night to cover 
their promise we be innocent 

good madam 
render i not so lose to my own sense 
to the honour of a prince base to coin 
a language for my purpose though you may 
repent the last night freedom and correct 
your judgement of i make i not so miserable 
to let the court think I invent this 
as destitute of noble way to move you 
but I presume this be to try my patience 
and make my joy at last more precious 
by this delay I know you be all virtue 
and can stain yourself by a denial 
of any syllable you speak 

with pardon 
of your grace I shall laugh if you persist thus 
you have a pleasant dream but lover 
be flatter in their sleep I speak to you 

then madam I take leave to tell you it be not 
do like a princess of that character 
we have receive and if I have no witness 
I see what mirth we be prepare for 

witness 
there be too much at stake my lord already 
to rack this argument for your own fame 
proceed not to enlarge it we will rather 
confess some guilt against ourself then let 
you honour be expose to such straight censure 
for love we yet if you will be silent 
in this we shall be proud in other thing 
to have deny you nothing and be ashamed 
you take our court so unprepared to honour you

nothing but truth although my willing ear 
catch up the voice she speak it to you signior

that she resolve to marry we 

your excellence

who suppose the duchess and this must 
sound hope in he to be so negative

cunning in this and must apply some compliment 
for our own honour good my lord your privacy 

How ere her grace be a little impudent

in such a cause she have no mind to marry he 
and perhaps talk to i last night to try 
my strength of wit woman be subtle creature 
no matter though Ursini court my sister 
my ambition fair a other side again

upon 
my conscience she hear the word

Ursini 

madam I be bold to press 
on your retirement but when you remember 
I bring no mutinous thought but such as be 
devote to your service you will think it 
a trespass that may soon invite a pardon 

you must first practise to offend my lord 
this be favour to i 

still such goodness 
flow from your language to i at the first 
encounter but when I take boldness to 
have some assurance from you alone 
which I have hope and serve for with the truth 
of your best honourer you decline the subject 
or fly the sweet conclusion 

my lord 
that you have love at least profess so much 
may easy be grant but let i 
beseech you sir do you upon the first 
motion that wrought upon your mind to think 
i worthy of your love acquaint i with it 

no madam 
I long cherish the soft fire 
that try the pureness of it and the object 
that shoot so bright a flame into my bosom 
and have suppress it still but that your virtue 
grow up too powerful against it than 
I take leave to express how much I wish 
to be your votary 

give i equal licence 
my lord in the same cause to try myself 
I have thought too will be compose of something 
in you to be examine 

I submit 
and shall obey your censure life and death 
hang on your lip I come to be determine 
your servant or your sacrifice for to languish 
at distance thus

present I much fear my lord I shall 
in that particular satisfy your lordship 

you want no knowledge of i there be nothing 
in my past fate but may appear to you 
my nature need no gloss my blood my fortune 
clear to your view my person not much wither 
if these together want a charm I can 
deserve you may love for I know best 
the extent of my devotion and the heart 
that though you shall despise it must still serve you 

but good my lord what answer you to this 
be it become the discretion 
of a noble servant to pursue his mistress 
by unruly way and interpose command 
and power of great one to enforce the heart 
of any lady though I must confess 
her grace may challenge my obedience 
to her law and person it have be yet a rule 
and love and religion can be compel 

you do not conclude i if I obtain 
a favour from the duchess to propound 
my wish and plead for i I know well 
the soul be not her subject can her power 
bestow your body on i and that I 
can boast myself lord of beauteous frame 
without your mind I be more tyrant to 
accept than she to force and answer for 
a crime more fatal than the ravisher 

your brother madam 

if I have any power 
my lord you must not leave i yet I will 
entreat your small retreat behind the hang 
for a few minute 

your command be a favour
