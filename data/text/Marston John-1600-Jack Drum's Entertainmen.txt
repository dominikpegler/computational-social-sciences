with such a fuel let i burn and die 
and like to Hercules so mount the sky 

come you grow wanton o you bite my lip 

in faith you jest I do but soft sip 
the roseal juice of your revive breath 
let clumsy judgement chillblained gouty wit 
bung up their chief content within the whoop 
of a stuff dry fat and repose their hope 
of happiness and heart tranquillity 
upon increase of dirt but let i live 
clip in the cincture of a faithful arm 
lull in content joy be make divine 
with the most precious love of Katherine 

let the unsanctified spirit of ambition 
entice the choice of muddy mind dame 
to yoke themselves to swine and for vain hope 
of gay rich trappings be still spur and prick 
with pine discontent for nuptial sweet 
but let i live love in my husband eye 
who thought with i may sweet sympathize 

the heaven shall melt the sun shall cease to shine 
before I leave the love of Katherine 

nay when heaven melt and the sun strike dead 
even then my love shall not be vanquish

thy love shall be my life thy hate my death 

o when I die let i embrace thy waste 

in death let i be count thou and chaste 

heaven grant be dead my soul may live nigh thou 

one kiss shall give thou i eternal 

in fair exchange vouchsafe my heart to take 

with all my mind wear this Ned for my sake
