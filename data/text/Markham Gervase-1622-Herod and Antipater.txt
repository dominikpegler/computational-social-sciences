that outfly thought or motion Egypt sweet 
have safety in it not jerusalem 

I do confess it yet this dangerous way 
of our escape have many fear about it 

there be pregnant reason for it and our life 
be mark that Herod shoot at who but see 
the woeful state of sad jerusalem 
and how this tyrant like a angry boar 
root up the goodly pine shall cover he 
have he not slay Antigonus destroy 
thy father and thy grandsire oh my lord

worthy Hircanus noble Alexander 
and at this instant lie he not in wait 
for our destruction beldame that I be

head with lightning strike unto the heart 
of every noble action what can king 
do that the rude not censure and pervert 
to vild interpretation nay although 
justice and mercy guard they though man fault 
be grow so odious that even cruelty 
be a commend goodness mere distrust 
a reasonable virtue secrecy 
important and most needful and suspect 
a worthy truth which need no witness 
yet in this case where man can err twice 
what shall we do that shall escape infamy

look round about the people then lift up 
her snowwhite hand to heaven 
talk to it as if she have be in it then fall down 
upon her humble knee which as they bend 
you may behold humility retire 
down to her heart and leave within her eye

banish the sun the moon and star do vanish 
and be it to obscure the world and spoil 
both man and beast nature and every thing 
yet will I do it and why I must and will be king 
kingly Antipater 

never grow pride more high more desperate 
nor ever can the arrogance of man 
find out a breast more large and spacious 
but fate and he must wrestle let i now 
entreat your worthy patience to contain 
much in imagination and what word 
can have time to utter let your eye 
out of this dumb show tell your memory

by the awe of great Augustus at who foot 
they cast their life and weapon he with frown 
chide the two angry prince yet command 
the father to forgive they peace be make 
only against Antipater they bend 
the fury of their courage which the king 
withstand and reconcile they all make sound 
Augustus give they garland and install 
they equal captain over Palestine 
but yet Antipater by Herod mean 
get the precedence and priority 
how in that throng he justle it be your eye 
and not my tongue must censure this we hope 
our scale be still ascend and you will find 
better and better and the best behind 

you must take my direction
