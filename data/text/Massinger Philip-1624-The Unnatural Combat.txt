thus far we be happy madam quit the place 
you shall hear how we succeed 

goodness reward you 

it be apparent and we stay too long 
to censure Malefort as he deserve 

there be no colour of reason that make for he 
have he discharge the trust commit to he 
with that experience and fidelity 
he practise heretofore it can not be 
our navy shall be block up and in our sight 
our good make prize our sailor sell for slave 
by his prodigious issue 

I much grieve 
after so many brave and high achievement 
he shall in one ill forfeit all the good 
he ever do his country 

well it be grant 

I humble thank you sir 

he shall have hear 
his iron too strike off bring he before we 
but seek no further favour 

sir I dare not 

Monsieur Chamont Montaigne Lanour assistant 
by a commission from the most christian king 
in punish or free Malefort 
our late great admiral though I know you need not 
instruction from i how to dispose of 
yourselves in this man trial that exact 
your clear judgement give i leave with favour 
to offer my opinion we be to hear he 
a little look back on his fair action 
loyal and true demeanour not as now 
by the general voice already he be condemn 
but if we find as most believe he have hold 
intelligence with his accurse son 
fall off from all allegiance and turn 
but for what cause we know not the most bloody 
and fatal enemy this country ever 
repent to have bring forth all compassion 
of what he be or may be if now pardon 
we sit engage to censure he with all 
extremity and rigour 

your lordship show we 
a path which we will tread in 

he that leave 
to follow as you lead will lose himself 

I will not be singular 

he come but with 
a strange distract look 

live I once more 
to see these hand and arm free these that often 
in the most dreadful horror of a fight 
have be as seamark to teach such as be 
second in my attempt to steer between 
the rock of too much date and pale fear 
to reach the port of victory when my sword 
advance thus to my enemy appear 
a hairy comet threaten death and ruin 
to such as dare behold it these the leg 
that when our ship be grapple carry i 
with such swift motion from deck to deck 
as they that see it with amazement cry 
he do not run but fly 

he still retain 
the greatness of his spirit 

now cramp with iron 
hunger and can they hardly do support i 
but I forget myself o my good lord 
that sit there as my judge to determine 
the life and death of Malefort where be now 
those shout those cheerful look those loud applause 
with which when I return load with spoil 
you entertain your admiral  all be forget 
and I stand here to give account for that 
of which I be as free and innocent 
as he that never see the eye of he 
for who I stand suspect 

Monsieur Malefort 
let not your passion so far transport you 
as to believe from any private malice 
Or envy to your person you be question 
for do the supposition want weight 
that do invite we to a strong assurance 
your son 

my shame 

pray you hear with patience ever 
without assistance or sure aid from you 
can with the pirate of Algiers and Tunisia 
even those that you have almost twice defeat 
acquire such credit as with they to be 
make absolute commander pray you observe i 
if there have not some contract pass between you 
that when occasion serve you will join with they 
to the ruin of Marseilles 

more what urge 
your son to turn apostate 

have he from 
the state or governor the least neglect 
which envy can interpret for a wrong 

or if you sleep not in your charge how can 
so many ship as do infest our coast 
and have in our own harbour shut our navy 
come in unfought with 

they put he hardly to it 

my lord with as much brevity as I can 
I will answer each particular objection 
with which you charge i the main ground on which 
you raise the build of your accusation 
have reference to my son shall I now curse he 
or wish in the agony of my trouble soul 
lightning have find he in his mother womb 
you will say be from the purpose and I therefore 
betake he to the devil and so leave he 
do never loyal father but myself 
beget a treacherous issue be it in i 
with as much ease to fashion up his mind 
as in his generation to form 
the organ to his body must it follow 
because that he be impious I be false 
I will not boast my action yet it be lawful 
to upbraid my benefit to unthankful man 
who sink the turkish galley in the straight 
but Malefort who rescue the french 〈◊〉 
when they be board and stow under hatch 
by the pirate of argiers every minute 
they do expect to be chain to the oar 
but your now doubt admiral than you fill 
the air with shout of joy and do proclaim 
when hope have leave they and grim look despair 
hover with sailstretch wing over their head 
to i as to the neptune of the sea 
they owe the restitution of their good 
their life their liberty o can it then 
be probable my lord that he that never 
become the master of a pirate ship 
but at the main yard hang the captain up 
and cause the rest to be throw over board 
shall after all these proof of deadly hate 
so oft express against they entertain 
a thought of quarter with they but much less 
to the perpetual ruin of my glory 
to join with they to lift a wicked arm 
against my mother country this Marseilles 
which with my prodigal expense of blood 
I have so oft protect 

what you have do 
be grant and applaud but yet know 
this glorious relation of your action 
must not so blind our judgement as to suffer 
this most unnatural crime you stand accuse of 
to pass unquestioned 

no you must produce 
reason of more validity and weight 
to plead in your defence or we shall hardly 
conclude you innocent 

the large volume of 
your former worthy deed with your experience 
both what and when to do but make against you 

for have your care and courage be the same 
as heretofore the danger we be plunge in 
have be with ease prevent 

what have I 
omit in the power of flesh and blood 
even in the birth to strangle the design 
of this hellbred wolf my son alas my lord 
I be no god nor like he can foresee 
his cruel thought and curse purpose 
nor will the sun at my command forbear 
to make his progress to the other world 
afford to we one continue light 
nor can my breath dispress those foggy mist 
cover with which and darkness of the night 
their navy undiscerned without resistance 
beset our harbour make not that my fault 
which you in justice must ascribe to fortune 
but if that nor my former act nor what 
I have deliver can prevail with you 
to make good my integrity and truth 
rip up this bosom and pluck out the heart 
that have be ever loyal 

how a trumpet 
inquire the cause 

thou searcher of man heart 
and sure defender of the innocent 
my other cry sin a while not look on 
if I in this be guilty strike the dead 
or by some unexpected mean confirm 
I be accuse unjust 

speak the motive 
that bring thou hither 

from our admiral thus 
he do salute you fair and desire 
it may be understand no public hate 
have bring he to Marseilles nor seek he 
the ruin of his country but aim only 
to wreak a private wrong and if from you 
he may have leave and liberty to decide it 
in a single combat he will give up good pledge 
if he fall in the trial of his right 
we shall weigh anchor and no more molest 
this town with hostile arm 

speak to the man 
if in this presence he appear to you 
to who you bring this challenge 

it be to you 

his father 

can it be 

strange and prodigious 

thou see I stand unmoved be thy voice thunder 
it shall not shake i say what will the viper 

the reverence a father name may challenge 
and duty of a son no more remember 
he do defy thou to the death 

go on 

and with his sword well prove it on thy head 
thou be a murderer a atheist 
and that all attribute of man turn fury 
can express thou this he will make good 
if thou dare give he meeting 

dare I live 
dare I when mountain of my sin over whelm i 
at my last gasp ask for mercy how I bless 
thy come captain never man to i 
arrive so opportune and thy message 
however it may seem to threaten death 
do yield to i a second life in cure 
my wound honour stand I yet suspect 
as a confederate with this enemy 
who of all man against all tie of nature 
he mark out for destruction you be just 
immortal power and in this merciful 
and it take from any sorrow and my shame 
for be the father to so bad a son 
in that you be please to offer up the monster 
to my correction blush and repent 
as you be bind my honourable lord 
your ill opinion of i not great Brutus 
the father of the roman liberty 
with more assure constancy behold 
his traitor son for labour to call home 
the banish Tarquin scourge with rod to death 
than I will show when I take back the life 
this prodigy of mankind receive from i 

we be sorry monsieur Malefort for our error 
and be much take with your resolution 
but the disparity of year and strength 
between you and your son due consider 
we will not so expose you 

then you kill i 
under pretence to save i o my lord 
as you love honour and a wrong man fame 
deny i not this fair and noble mean 
to make i right again to all the world 
shall any other but myself be choose 
to punish this apostata with death 
you rob a wretched father of a justice 
that to all after time will be record 
I wish his strength be centuple his skill equal 
to my experience that in his fall 
he may not shame my victory I feel 
the power and spirit of twenty strong man in i 
be he with wild fire circle I undaunted 
will make way to he as you do affect sir 
my daughter Theocrine as you be 
my true and ancient friend as thou be valiant 
and as all love a soldier second i 
in this my just petition in your look 
I see a grant my lord 

you shall overbear i 
and since you be so confident in your cause 
prepare you for the combat 

with more joy 
than yet I ever taste by the next sun 
the disobedient rebel shall hear from i 
and so return in safety my good lord 
to all my service I will die or purchase 
rest to Marseilles nor can I make doubt 
but his impiety be a potent charm 
to edge my sword and add strength to my arm 

he do accept the challenge then 

nay more 
be over joy in it and as it have be 
a fair invitement to a solemn feast 
and not a combat to conclude with death 
he cheerful embrace it 

be the article 
sign to on both part 

at the father suit 
with much unwillingness the governor 
consent to they 

you be inward with 
our admiral can you yet never learn 
what the nature of the quarrel be that render 
the son more than incense implacable 
against the father 

never yet I have 
as far as manner will give warrant to it 
with my best curiousness of care observe he 
I have sate with he in his cabin a day together 
yet not a syllable exchange between we 
sigh he do often as if inward grief 
and melancholy at that instant will 
choke up his vital spirit and now and then 
a tear or two as in derision of 
the toughness of his rugged temper will 
fall on his hollow cheek which but once feel 
a sudden flash of fury do dry up 
and lay then his hand upon his sword 
he will murmur but yes so as I oft hard he 
we shall meet cruel father yet we shall 
when I will exact for every womanish drop 
of sorrow from these eye a strict account 
of much more from thy heart 

it be wondrous strange 

and past my apprehension 

yet what make 
the miracle great when from the main top 
a sail be descry all thought that do concern 
himself lay by no lion pinch with hunger 
rouse himself more fierce from his den 
than he come on the deck and there how wise 
he give direction and how stout he be 
in his execution we to admiration 
have be eyewitness yet he never mind 
the booty when it be make we but as if 
the danger in the purchase of the prey 
delight he much more than the reward 
his will make know he do retire himself 
to his private contemplation no joy 
express by he for victory 

hear he come 
but with more cheerful look then ever yet 
I see he wear 

it be long since resolve on 
nor must I stagger now may the cause 
that force i to this unnatural act 
be bury in everlasting silence 
and I find rest in death or my revenge 
to either I stand equal pray you gentleman 
be charitable in your censure of i 
and do not entertain a false belief 
that I be mad for undertake that 
which must be when effect still repent 
it add to my calamity that I have 
discourse and reason and but too well know 
I can nor live nor end a wretched life 
but both way I be impious do not therefore 
ascribe the perturbation of my soul 
to a servile fear of death I oft have view 
all kind of his inevitable dart 
not be they terrible be I condemn to leap 
from the cloudcovered brow of a steep rock 
into the deep or curtiuslike to fill up 
for my country safety and a after name 
a bottomless abyss or charge through fire 
it can not so much shake i as the encounter 
of this day single enemy 

if you please sir 
you may shun it or defer it 

not for the world 
yet two thing I entreat you the first be 
you will not inquire the difference between 
myself and he which as a father once 
I honour now my deadly enemy 
the last be if I fall to bear my body 
far from this place and where you please inter it 
I shall say more but by his sudden come 
I be cut off 

let i sir have the honour 
to be your second 

with your pardon sir 
I must put in for that since our try friendship 
have last from our infancy 

I have serve 
under your command and you have see i fight 
and handsome though I say it and if now 
at this downright game I may but hold your card 
I will not pull down the side 

I rest much bind 
to your so noble offer and I hope 
shall find your pardon though I now refuse they 
for which I will yield strong reason but as brief 
as the time will give i leave for i to borrow 
that be suppose the weak any aid 
from the assistance of my second sword 
may write i down in the black list of those 
that have nor fire nor spirit of their own 
but dare and do as they derive their courage 
from his example on who help and valour 
they whole do depend let this suffice 
in my excuse for that now if you please 
on both part to retire to yonder mount 
where you as in a roman theater 
may see the bloody difference determine 
your favour meet my wish 

it be approve of 
by i and I command you lead the way 
and leave i to my fortune 

I will glad 
be a spectator since I be deny 
to be a actor of each blow and thrust 
and punctual observe they 

you shall have 
all you desire for in a word or two 
I must make bold to entertain the time 
if he give suffrage to it 

yes I will 
I will hear thou and then kill thou nay farewell 

embrace with love on both side and with we 
leave deadly hate and fury 

from this place 
you never shall see both live 

what be past help be 
beyond prevention 

now we be alone sir 
and thou have liberty to unload the burden 
which thou groan under speak thy grief 

I shall sir 
but in a perplex form and method which 
you only can interpret will you have not 
a guilty knowledge in your bosom of 
the language which you force i to deliver 
so I be nothing as you be my father 
I bend my knee and uncompelled profess 
my life and all that be i to be your gift 
and that in a son duty I stand bind 
to lay this head beneath your foot and run 
all desperate hazard for your ease and safety 
but this confess on my part I rise up 
and not as with a father all respect 
love fear and reverence cast off but as 
a wicked man I thus expostulate with you 
why have you do that which I dare not speak 
and in the action change the humble shape 
of my obedience to rebellious rage 
and insolent pride and with shut eye constrain i 
to run my bark of honour on a shelf 
I must not see nor if I see it shun it 
in my wrong nature suffer and look backward 
and mankind tremble to see i pursue 
what beast will fly from for when I advance 
this sword as I must do against your head 
piety will weep and filial duty mourn 
to see their altar which you build up in i 
in a moment raze and ruine that you can 
from my grieve soul I wish it but produce 
to qualify not excuse your deed of horror 
our seem reason that I may fix here 
and move no father 

have I so far lose 
a father power that I must give account 
of my action to my son or must I plead 
as a fearful prisoner at the bar while he 
that owe his be to i sir a judge 
to censure that which only by myself 
ought to be question mountain soon fall 
beneath their valley and the lofty pine 
pay homage to the bramble or what else be 
preposterous in nature ere my tongue 
in one short syllable yield satisfaction 
to any doubt of thou nay though it be 
a certainty disdain argument 
since though my deed wear Hell black livery 
to thou they shall appear triumphal robe 
set off with glorious honour thou be bind 
to see with my eye and to hold that reason 
that take or birth or fashion from my will 

this sword divide that slavish knot 

it can 
it can wretch and if thou but remember 
from who thou have this spirit thou dare not hope it 
who train thou up in arm but I who teach thou 
man be man only when they dare look down 
with scorn on death and danger and contemn 
all opposition till plume victory 
have make her constant stand upon their helmet 
under my shield thou have fight as secure 
as the young eglet cover with the wing 
of her fierce dam learn how and where to prey 
all that be manly in thou I call i 
but what be weak and womanish thy own 
and what I give since thou be proud ungrateful 
presume to contend with he to who 
submission be due I will take from thou 
look therefore for extremity and expect not 
I will correct thou as a son but kill thou 
as a serpent swell with poison who survive 
a little long with infection breath 
will render all thing near he like itself 
contagious nay now my anger be up 
ten thousand virgin kneel at my foot 
and with one general cry howl for mercy 
shall not redeem thou 

thou incense power 
a while forbear thy thunder let i have 
no aid in my revenge if from the grave 
my mother 

thou shall never name she more 

they be at it 

that thrust be put strong home 

but with more strength avoid 

Wellcome in 
he have draw blood of he yet well do old cock 

that be a strange miss 

that a certain hit 

he be fall the day be we 

the admiral be slay 

the father be victorious 

let we haste 
to gratulate his conquest 
1 we to mourn 
the fortune of the son 

with utmost speed 
acquaint the governor with the good success 
that he may entertain to his full merit 
the father of his country peace and safety 

Were a new life hide in each mangle limb 
I will search and find it and however to some 
I may seem cruel thus to tyrannize 
upon this senseless flesh I glory in it 
that I have power to be unnatural 
be my security die all my fear 
and wake jealousy which have so long 
be my tormentor there be now no suspicion 
a fact which I alone be conscious of 
can never be discover or the cause 
that call this duel on I be above 
all perturbation nor be it in 
the power of fate again to make i wretched 

all honour to the conqueror 
who dare tax 
my friend of treachery now 

I be very glad sir 
you have speed so well but I must tell you thus much 
to put you in mind that a low ebb must follow 
your high swell tide of happiness you have purchase this 
hour at a high price 

it be Belgarde 
above all estimation and a little 
to be exalt with it can savour 
of arrogance that to this arm and sword 
Marseilles owe the freedom of her fear 
or that my loyalty not long since eclipse 
shine now more bright than ever be not thing 
to be lament though indeed they may 
appear too dear buy my fall glory 
be make up again and cement 
with a son blood it be true he be my son 
while he be worthy but when he shake off 
his duty to i which my fond indulgence 
upon submission may perhaps have pardon 
and grow his county enemy I look on he 
as a stranger to my family and a traitor

though I dislike not what be motion yet 
in what so near concern i it be fit 
I shall proceed with judgement 

here she come 
look on she with impartial eye and then 
let envy if it can name one grace feature 
in which she be defective 

welcome girl 
my joy my comfort my delight my all 
why do thou come to greet my victory 
in such a sable habit this show well 
when thy father be a prisoner and suspect 
but now his faith and loyalty be admire 
rather than doubt in your outward garment 
you be to express the joy you feel within 
nor shall you with more curiousness and care 
pace to the temple to be make a bride 
than now when all man eye be fix upon you 
you shall appear to entertain the honour 
from i descend to you and in which 
you have a equal share 

heaven have my thanks 
with all humility pay for your fair fortune 
and so far duty bind i you a little 
to mourn a brother loss however wicked 
the tenderness familiar to our sex 
may if you please excuse 

thou be deceive 
he live be a blemish to thy beauty 
but in his death give ornament and lustre 
to thy perfection but that they be 
so exquisite rare that they admit not 
the least addition Hah here be yet a print 
of a sad tear on thy cheek how it take from 
our present happiness with a father lip 
a love father lip I will kiss it off 
the cause no more remember 

you forget sir 
the presence we be in 

it be well consider 
and yet who be the owner of a treasure 
above all value but without offence 
may glory in the glad possession of it 
nor let it in you excellence beget wonder 
or any here that look on the daughter 
I feast myself in the imagination 
of those sweet pleasure and allow delight 
I taste from the mother who still live 
in this her perfect model for she have 
such smooth and high arch brow such sparkle eye 
who every glance store Cupid empty quiver 
such ruby lip and such a lovely brown 
disdain all adulterate aid of art 
keep a perpetual spring upon her face 
as death himself lament be force 
to blast it with his paleness and if now 
her brightness dim with sorrow take and please you 
think think young lord when she appear herself 
this veil remove in her own natural pureness 
how far she will transport you 

do she need it 
the praise which you and well deserve give to she 
must of necessity raise new desire 
in one indebt more to year to i 
your word be but as oil pour on a fire 
that flame already at the height 

no more 
I do believe you and let i from you 
find so much credit when I make she you 
I do possess you of a gift which I 
with much unwillingness part from my good lord 
for bear your further trouble give i leave for on the sudden I 
be indispose to retire to my own house and rest tomorrow 
as you command i I will be your guest 
and have deck my daughter like herself 
you shall have far conference 

you be master 
of your own will but fail not I will expect you 

nay I will be excuse I must part with you 
my dear Theocrine give i thy hand 
I will support thou 

you gripe it too hard sir 

Indeed I do but have no far end in it 
but love and tenderness such as I may challenge 
and you must grant thou be a sweet one yet 
and to be cherish 

may I still deserve it 

with my best endeavour 
let they bring stomach there be no want of meat sir 
portly and curious viand be prepare 
to please all kind of appetite 

it be well 
I love a table furnish with full plenty 
and store of friend to eat it but with this caution 
I will not have my house a common inn 
for some man that come rather to devour i 
than to present their service at this time too 
it be a serious and solemn meeting 
I must not have my board pester with shadow 
that under other man protection break in 
without invitement 

with your favour then 
you must double your guard my lord for on my knowledge 
there be some so sharp set not to be keep out 
by a file of Musketeer and it be less danger 
I will undertake to stand at push of pike 
with a enemy in a breach that undermine too 
and the cannon play on it than to stop 
one harpy your perpetual guest from entrance 
when the dresser the cook drum thunder come on 
the service will be lose else 

what be he 

as tall a trencherman that be most certain 
as ere demolish piefortification 
as soon as batter and if the rim of his belly 
be not make up of a much tough stuff 
than his buff jerkin there be no defence 
against the charge of his gut you needs must know he 
he be eminent for his eat 

o Belgarde 

the same one of the admiral cast captain 
who swear there be no war nor hope of any 
the only drill be to eat devout 
and to beever drink that be allow of 
but they know not where to get it there be the spite on it 

the more their misery yet if you can 
for this day put he off 

it be beyond the invention of man 

no say this only 
and as from i you apprehend i 

yes sir 

but it must be do grave 

never doubt i sir 

we will dine in the great room but let the music 
and banquet be prepare here 

this will make he 
lose his dinner at the least and that will vex he 
as for the sweet meat when they be tread under foot 
let he take his share with the page and lackey 
or scramble in the rush 

it be near twelve 
I keep a watch within i never miss 
save thou master steward 

you be most welcome sir 

have thy lord sleep well tonight I come to inquire 
I have a foolish dream that against my will 
carry i from my lodging to learn only 
how he be dispose 

he be in most perfect health sir 

let i but see he feed hearty at dinner 
and I will believe so too for from that ever 
I make a certain judgement 

it hold sure 
in your own constitution 

and in all man 
it be the best symptom let we lose no time 
delay be dangerous 

troth sir if I may 
without offence deliver what my lord have 
commit to my trust I shall receive it 
as a special favour 

we will see it and discourse 
as the proverb say for health sake after dinner 
or rather after supper willing then 
I will walk a mile to hear thou 

nay good sir 
I will be brief and pithy 

prithee be so 

he bid i say of all his guest that he 
stand most affect to you for the freedom 
and plainness of your manner he never observe you 
to twirl a dish about you do not like of 
all be please to you or to take 
a say of venison or stale fowl by your nose 
which be a solecism at another table 
but by strong eat of they do confirm 
they never be delicious to your palate 
but when they be mortify as the Huguenot say 
and so your part grow great nor do you 
find fault with the sauce keen hunger be the best 
which ever to your much praise you bring with you 
nor will you with impertinent relation 
which be a masterpiece when meat before you 
forget your tooth to use your nimble tongue 
but do the feat you come for 

be advise 
and end your jeer for if you proceed 
you will feel as I can eat I can be angry 
and beat may ensue 

I will take your counsel 
and roundly come to the point my lord much wonder 
that you that be a courtier as a soldier 
in all thing else and every day can vary 
your action and discourse continue constant 
to this one suit 

to one it be well I have one unpawned in these day every cast commander be not bless with the fortune I assure you but why this question do this offend he 

not much but he believe it be the reason 
you never presume to fit above the salt 
and therefore this day our great admiral 
with other state be invite guest 
he do entreat you to appear among they 
in some fresh habit 

this staff shall not serve 
to beat the dog off these be soldier garment 
and so by consequence grow contemptible 

it have sting he 

I will I be acquaint with the player 
in charity they may furnish i but there be 
no faith in broker and for believe tailor 
they be only to be read of but not see 
and sure they be confine to their own hell 
and there they live invisible well I must not 
be fob off thus pray you report my service 
to the lord governor I will obey he 
and though my wardrobe be poor rather than lose 
his company at this feast I will put on 
the rich suit I have and fill the chair 
that make i worthy of 

we be shut of he he will be see no more here how my fellow 
will bless i for his absence he have starve they 
have he stay a little long will be can 
for his own sake shift a shirt and that be the utmost 
of his ambition adieu good captain 

it be a strange fondness 

it be beyond example 
his resolution to part with his estate 
to make her dower the weighty be nothing 
but to observe how curious he be 
in his own person to add ornament 
to his daughter ravish feature be the wonder 
I send a page of i in the way of courtship 
this morning to she to present my service 
from who I understand all there he find he 
solicitous in what shape she shall appear 
this gown be rich but the fashion stale the other 
be quaint and neat but the stuff not rich enough 
then do he curse the tailor and in rage 
fall on her shoemaker for want art 
to express in every circumstance the form 
of her most delicate foot then sit in counsel 
with much deliberation to find out 
what tire will best adorn she and one choose 
vary in his opinion he tear off 
and stamp it under foot then try a second 
a three and four and satisfy at length 
with much ado in that he grow again 
perplex and trouble where to place her jewel 
to be most mark and whether she shall wear 
this diamond on her forehead or between 
her milkwhite pap dispute on it both way 
then take in this hand a rope of pearl 
the best of France he serious consider 
whither she shall dispose it on her arm 
or on her neck with 20 other trifle too tedious to deliver 

I have know he from his first youth but never yet observe 
in all the passage of his life and fortune 
virtue so mix with vice valiant the world speak he 
but with that bloody liberal in his gift too 
but to maintain his prodigal expense 
a fierce extortioner a impotent lover 
of woman for a flash but his fire quench 
hate as deadly the truth be I be not 
ambitious of this match nor will I cross you in your affection 

I have ever find you 
and it be my happiness a love father 
and careful of my good by the loud music 
as you give order for his entertainment 
he be come into the house two long hour since 
the colonel commissioner and captain 
to pay he all the rite his worth can challenge 
go to wait on he hither 

you be most welcome 
and what I speak to you do from my heart 
disperse itself to all 

you meet my lord your trouble 

rather sir increase of honour 
when you be please to grace my house 

the favour redouble on my part most worthy sir 
since your fair daughter my incomparable mistress 
deign we her presence 

view she well brave Beaufort 
but yet at distance you hereafter may 
make your approach near when the priest 
have make it lawful and be not she my 
I dare aloud proclaim it Hymen never 
put on his saffron colour robe to change 
a barren virgin name with more good omen 
then at her nuptial look on she again 
then tell i if she now appear the same 
that she be yesterday 

be herself 
she can but be excellent these rich 
and curious dress which in other may 
cover deformity from she take lustre 
nor can add to she 

you conceive she right 
and in your admiration of her sweetness 
you only can deserve she blush not girl 
thou be above his praise or i nor can 
obsequious flattery though she shall use 
her thousand oil tongue to advance thy worth 
give aught for that be impossible but take from 
thy more than humane grace and even then 
when she have spend herself with her best strength 
the wrong she have do thou shall be so apparent 
that lose her own servile shape and name 
she will be think detraction but I 
forget myself and something whisper to i 
I have say too much 

I know not what to think on it 
but there be some mystery in it which I fear 
will be too soon discover 

I much wrong 
your patience noble sir by too much hug 
my proper issue and like the foolish crow 
believe my black brood swan 

there need not sir 
the least excuse for this nay I must have 
your arm you be the master of the feast 
and this the mistress 

I be anything 
that you shall please to make i 

nay it be you 
without more compliment 

your will be a law sir 

will I have be bear a Lord 

or I a lady 

it may be you be both be get in court 
though breed up in the city for your mother 
as I have hear love the lobby and there nightly 
be see strange apparition and who know 
but that some noble fawn heat with wine 
and cloy with partridge have a kind of longing 
to trade in sprat this need no exposition 
but can you yield a reason for your wish 

why have I be bear a lord I have be no servant 

and where as now necessity make we waiter 
we have be attend on 

and may have sleep then 
as long as we please and feed when we have stomach 
and wear new clothes nor live as now in hope 
of a cast gown or petticoat 

you be fool 
and ignorant of your happiness ere I be 
swear to the pantofle I have hear my tutor 
prove it by logic that a servant life 
be better than his master and by that 
I learn from he if that my memory fall not 
I will make it good 

proceed my little wit 
in decimo sexto 

thus then from the king 
to the beggar by gradation all be servant 
and you must grant the slavery be less 
to study to please one than many 

true 

well then and first to you sir you complain 
you serve one lord but your lord serve a thousand 
beside his passion that be his worst master 
you must humour he and he be bind to soothe 
every grim sir above he if he frown 
for the least neglect you fear to lose your place 
but if and with all slavish observation 
from the minion self to the groom of his close stool 
he hourly seek not favour he be sure 
to be ease of his office though perhaps he buy it 
nay more that high disposer of all such 
that be subordinate to he serve and fear 
the fury of the manyheaded monster 
the giddy multitude and as a horse 
be still a horse for all his golden trappings 
so your man of purchase title at their best be 
but servingman in rich livery 

most rare infant 
where learn thou this morality 

why thou dull pate 
as I can thou of my tutor 

now for we boy 

I be cut of the governor 

quick quick sir 
see all thing perfect 

let the blame be we else 

and as I say when we be at the banquet 
and high in our cup for it be no feast without it 
especial among soldier Theocrine 
be retire as that be no place for she 
take you occasion to rise from the table 
and lose no opportunity 

it be my purpose 
and if I can win she to give her heart 
I have a holy man in readiness 
to join our hand for the admiral her father repent he of his grant to i and 
so far transport with a strange opinion 
of her fair feature that shall we desire it 
I think ere long he will believe and strong 
the dauphin be not worthy of she I 
be much amaze with it 

nay dispatch there fellow 

we be ready when you please sweet form your pardon 
it have be such a busy time I can not 
tender that ceremonious respect 
which you deserve but now the great work end 
I will attend the less and with all care 
observe and serve you 

this be a pen speech 
and serve as a perpetual preface to 
a dinner make of fragment 

we wait on you 

you be not merry sir 

yes my good lord 
you have give we ample mean to drown all care 
and yet I nourish strange thought which I will 
most willing destroy 

pray you take your place 

and drink a health and let it be if you please 
to the worthy of woman now observe he 

give i the bowl since you do i the honour 
I will begin it 

may we know her name sir 

you shall I will not choose a foreign queen 
nor yet our own for that will relish of 
tame flattery nor do their height of title 
or absolute power confirm their worth and goodness 
these be heaven gift and frequent confer 
on such as be beneath they nor will I 
name the king mistress howsoever she 
in his esteem may carry it but if I 
as wine give liberty may use my freedom 
not sway this way or that with confidence 
and I will make it good on any equal 
if it must be to she who outward form 
be better by the beauty of her mind 
she live not that with justice can pretend 
a interest to this so sacred health 
but my fair daughter he that only doubt it 
I do pronounce a villain this to she then 

what may we think of this 

it matter not 

for my part I will soothe he rather than 
draw on a quarrel Chamont 

it be the safe course and one I mean to follow 

it have go round sir 

now you have do she right if there be any 
worthy to second this propose it bold 
I be your pledge 

let we pause here if you please 
and entertain the time with something else 
music there in some lofty strain the song too 
that I give order for the new one call 
the soldier delight 
the song end enter Belgarde in armour a case of carbine by his side 

who stop i now 
or who dare only say that I appear not 
in the most rich and glorious habit that 
render a man complete what court so set off 
with state and ceremonious pomp but thus 
accoutre I may enter or what feast 
though all the element at once be ransack 
to store it with variety transcend 
the curiousness and cost on Traian birth day 
where prince only and confederate king 
do sit as guest serve and attend on 
by the senator of Rome sit with a soldier 
in this his natural and proper shape 
may not and bold fill a seat and by 
his present make the great solemnity 
more honour and remarkable 

it be acknowledge 
and this a grace do to i unexpected 

but why in armour 

what be the mystery 
pray you reveal that 

soldier out of action 
that very rare but like unbidden guest 
bring their stool with they for their own defence 
at court shall feed in gauntlet they may have 
their finger cut else there your carpet knight 
that never charge beyond a mistress lip 
be still most keen and valiant but to you 
who it do most concern my lord I will 
address my speech and with a soldier freedom 
in my reproof return the bitter scoff 
you throw upon my poverty you contemn 
my courser outside and from that conclude 
as by your groom you make i understand 
I be unworthy to sit at your table 
among these tissue and embroidery 
unless I change my habit I have do it 
and show myself in that which I have wear 
in the heat and fervour of a bloody fight 
and then it be in fashion not as now 
ridiculous and despise this have pass through 
a wood of pike and every one aim at it 
yet scorn to take impression from their fury 
with this as still you see it fresh and new 
I have charge through fire that will have singe your sable 
black fox and ermine and change the proud colour 
of scarlet though of the right tyrian die 
but now as if the trappings make the man such only be 
admire that come adorn 
with what be no part of they this be my own 
my rich suit a suit I must not part from 
but not regard now and yet remember 
it be we that bring you in the mean of feast 
banquet and revel which when you possess 
with barbarous ingratitude you deny we 
to be make sharer in the harvest which 
our sweat and industry reap and sow for you 
the silk you wear we with our blood spin for you 
this massy plate that with the ponderous weight 
do make your cupboard crack we unaffrighted 
with tempest or the long and tedious way 
or dreadful monster of the deep that wait 
with open jaw still ready to devour we 
fetch from the other world let it not then 
in after age to your shame be speak 
that you wish no relent eye look on 
our want that feed your plenty or consume 
in prodigal and wanton gift on drone 
the kingdom treasure yet detain from we 
the debt that with the hazard of our life 
we have make you stand engage for or force we 
against all civil government in armour 
to require that which with all willingness 
shall be tender ere demand 

I commend 
this wholesome sharpness in you and prefer it 
before obsequious tameness it show lovely 
nor shall the rain of your good counsel fall 
upon the barren sand but spring up fruit 
such as you long have wish for and the rest 
of your profession like you discontent 
for want of mean shall in their present payment 
be bind to praise your boldness and hereafter 
I will take order you shall have no cause 
for want of change to put your armour on 
but in the face of a enemy not as now 
among your friend to that which be due to you 
to furnish you like yourself of my own bounty 
I will add five hundred crown 

I to my power 
will follow the example 

take this captain 
it be all my present store but when you please 
command i further 

I can wish it more 

this be the lucky jest ever come from i 
let a soldier use no other scribe to draw 
the form of his petition this will speed 
when your thrice humble supplication 
with prayer for increase of health and honour 
to their grave lordship shall as soon as read 
be pocket up the cause no more remember 
when this dumb rhetoric well I have a life 
which I in thankfulness for your great favour 
my noble lord when you please to command it 
must never think my own broker be happy 
these golden bird fly to thou 

you be dull sir 
and seem not to be take with the passage 
you see present 

passage I observe none 
my thought be elsewhere busy ha she be 
in danger to be lose to be lose for ever 
if speedy I come not to her rescue 
for so my genius tell i 

what chimaera 
work on your fantasy 

fantasy they be truth 
where be my Theocrine you have plot 
to rob i of my daughter  bring i to she 
or I will call down the saint to witness for i 
you be inhospitable 

you amaze i 
your Daughter sake and now exchange courtship 
with my son her servant why do you hear this 
with such distract look since to that end 
you bring she hither 

it be confess I do 
but now pray you pardon i and if you please 
ere she deliver up her virgin fort 
I will observe what be the art he use 
in plant his artillery against it 
she be my only care nor must she yield 
but upon noble term 

it be so determine 

yet I be jealous 

overmuch I fear 
what passion be these 

Come I will bring you 
where you with these if they so please may see 
the lovescene act 

there be something more 
than fatherly love in this 

we wait upon you 

since then you meet my flame with equal order 
as you profess it be your bounty mistress 
nor must I call it debt yet it be your glory 
that your excess supply my want and make thou 
strong in my weakness which can never be 
but in your good opinion 

you teach i sir 
what I shall say since from your san of favour 
I like dim Phoebe in herself obscure 
borrow that light I have 

which you return 
with large increase since that you will overcome 
and I dare  please 
to make what be yet divide one 

I have 
already in my wish modesty 
forbid i to speak more 

but what assurance 
but still without offence may I demand 
that may secure i that your heart tongue 
join to make up this harmony 

choose any 
suit your love distinguish from lust 
to ask and i to grant 

yonder they be 

at distance too it be yet well 

I may take then 
this hand and with a thousand burn kiss 
swear it be the anchor to my hope 

you may sir 

this be somewhat too much 

and this do view myself 
in these true mirror 

ever true to you sir 
and may they lose the ability of fight 
when they seek other object 

this be more 
than I can give consent to 

and a kiss 
thus print on your lip will not distaste you 

her lip 

why where shall he kiss be you distract 

then when this holy man have make it lawful 

a priest so ready too I must break in  

and what be speak here be register above 
I must ingross those favour to myself 
which be not to be name 

all I can give 
but what they be I know not 

I will instruct you 

o how my blood boil 

pray you contain yourself 
methinks his courtship be modest 

then be i 
and whole i the river of your love 
to kinsman and ally nay to your father 
however out of his tenderness he admire you 
must in the ocean of your affection 
to i be swallow up and want a name 
compare with what you owe i 

it be most fit  sir 
the strong bond that bind i to you must 
dissolve the weak 

I be ruine if 
I come not fair off 

there be nothing want 
but your consent 

some strange invention aid i 
This yes it must be so 

why do you stagger 
when what you seem so much to wish be offer 

both party be agree to 

I will not court 
a grant from you nor do I wrong your daughter 
though I say my son deserve she 

it be far from 
my humble thought to undervalue he 
I can prize too high for howsoever 
from my own fond indulgence I have sing 
her praise with too prodigal a tongue 
that tenderness lay by I stand confirm 
all that I fancy excellent in she 
balance with what be real his own 
hold weight in no proportion 

new turn 

whither tend this 

have you observe my lord 
with what a sweet gradation he will 
as I do punctual you can blame she 
though she do listen with a greedy ear 
to his fair modest offer but so great 
a good as then flow to she shall have be 
with more deliberation entertain 
and not with such haste swallow she shall first 
consider serious what the blessing be 
and in what ample manner to give thank for it 
and then receive it and though I shall think 
short minute year till it be perfit●ed 
I will defer that which I most desire 
and so must she till long expectation 
that heighten pleasure make she true know 
her happiness and with what outstretched arm 
she must embrace it 

this be curiousness 
beyond example 

let it then begin 
from i in what be i own I will use my will 
and yield no further reason I lay claim to 
the liberty of a subject fall not off 
but be obedient or by the hair 
I will drag thou home censure i as you please 
I will take my own way oh the inward fire 
that want vent consume i 

it be most certain 
he be mad or worse 

how worse 

nay there I leave you 
my thought be free 

this I foresee 

take comfort 
h shall walk in cloud but I will discover he 
and he shall find and feel if he excuse not 
and with strong reason this gross injury 
I can make use of my authority 

sir do you call 

I look no soon on her 
but all my boast power of reason leave i 
and passion again usurp her empire do none else wait i 

I be wretched sir shall any owe more duty 

this be worse than disobedience leave i 

on my knee sir as I have ever square my will by you 
And like and loathe with your eye I beseech you 
to teach i what the nature of my fault be 
that have incense you sure it be one of weakness 
and not of malice which your gentle temper 
on my submission I hope will pardon 
which grant by your piety if that I 
out of the least neglect of i hereafter 
make you remember it may I sink ever 
under your dread command 

o my star who can but dote on this humility 
that sweeten lovely in her tear the fetter 
that seem to lessen in their weight but now 
by this grow heavy on i 

dear sir 

peace I must not hear thou 

not look on i 

no thy look and word be charm 

may they have power then 
to calm the tempest of your wrath alas sir 
do I but know in what I give offence 
in my repentance I will show my sorrow 
for what be past and in my care hereafter 
kill the occasion or cease to be 
since life without your favour be to i a load I will cast off 

o that my heart be rend in sunder that I may expire 
the cause in my death bury yet I know not 
with such prevail oratory it be beg from i 
that to deny thou will convince i to 
have suck the milk of tiger rise and I 
but in a perplex and mysterious method 
will make relation that which all the world 
admire and cry up in thou for perfection 
be to unhappy i foul blemish 
and mulct in nature if thou have be bear 
deform and crooked in the feature of 
thy body as the manner of thy mind 
moor lip flat nose dim eye and beetle browed 
with a dwarf stature to a giant waste 
sour breathe with claw for finger on thy hand 
splay footed gouty legged and over all 
a loathsome leprosy have spread itself 
and make thou shun of humane fellowship 
I have be bless 

why will you with a monster 
for such a one or worse you have describe 
to call your father 

rather than as now 
though I have drown thou for it in the sea 
appear as thou do a new Pandora 
with Juno fair cow eye Minerva brow 
Aurora blush cheek Hebe fresh youth 
Venus soft pap with Thetis silver foot 

sir you have like and love they and oft force 
with your hyperbole of praise pour on they 
my modesty to a defensive red 
strew over that paleness which you then be please 
to style the pure white 

and in that cup I drink the poison I now feel disperse 
through every vain and artery wherefore be thou 
so cruel to i This thy outward shape 
bring a fierce war against i not to be 
by flesh and blood resist but to leave i 
no hope of freedom from the magazine 
of thy mind force treacherous thou draw up 
auxiliary help to strengthen that 
which be already in itself too potent 
thy beauty give the first charge but thy duty 
second with thy care and watchful study 
to please and serve my will in all that may 
raise up content in i like thunder break through 
all opposition and my rank of reason 
disband my victorious passion fall 
to bloody execution and compel i 
with willing hand to it be on my own chain 
and with a kind of flatter joy to glory in my captivity 

ay in this you speak sir be ignorance itself 

and so continue for knowledge of the arm thou bear against i 
will make thou curse thyself but yield no aid 
for thou to help i and it be cruelty 
in i to wound that spotless innocency 
however it make i guilty in a word 
the pleurisy of goodness be thy ill 
thy virtue vice and thy humble lowness 
far worse than stubborn sullenness and pride 
thy look that ravish all beholder else 
as kill as the basilisk their tear 
express in sorrow for the much I suffer 
a glorious insultation and no sign 
of pity in thou and to hear thou speak 
in thy defence though but in silent action 
will make the hurt already deep fester 
incurable and therefore as thou will not 
by thy presence raise fresh fury to torment i 
I do conjure thou by a father power 
and it be my curse I dare not think it lawful 
to sue unto thou in a near name 
without reply to leave i 

my obedience never learn yet to question your command 
but willing to serve they yet I must 
since that your will forbid the knowledge of 
my fault lament my fortune 

o that I have reason to discern the better way 
and yet pursue the worse when I look on she 
I burn with heat and in her absence freeze 
with the cold blast of jealousy that another 
shall ere taste those delight that be deny i 
and which of their affliction bring less torture 
I hardly can distinguish be there then 
no mean no so my understanding tell i 
and that by my cross fate it be determine 
that I be both way wretched 

yonder he walk sir 
in much vexation he have send my lady 
his daughter weep in but what the cause be 
rest yet in supposition 

I guess at it but must be further satisfy I will sift he 
in private therefore quit the room 

I be go sir 

Hal who disturb i Montrevile your pardon 

will you can grant one to yourself I speak it 
with the assurance of a friend and yet 
before it be too late make reparation 
of the gross wrong your indiscretion offer 
to the governor and his son nay to yourself 
for there begin my sorrow 

will I have no great cause to mourn 
then their displeasure for I dare justify 

we must not do all that we dare private friend 
I observe your alteration with a strict eye 
perhaps then other and to lose no time 
in repetition your strange demeanour 
to your sweet daughter 

will you can find out some other theme to treat of 

none but this and this I will dwell on how ridiculous 
and subject to construction 

no more 

you make yourself amaze i and if 
the frequent trial interchange between we 
of love and friendship be to their desert 
esteem by you as they hold weight with i 
no inward trouble shall be of a shape 
so horrid to yourself but that to i 
you stand bind to discover it and unlock 
your secret thought though the most innocent be 
loud cry sin 

and so perhaps they be 
and therefore be not curious to learn that 
which know must make you hate i 

think not so I be you in right and wrong not shall you find 
a verbal friendship in i but a active 
and here I vow I shall no soon know 
what the disease be but if you give leave 
I will apply a remedy be it madness 
I be familiar acquaint with a deep read man 
that can with charm and herb 
restore you to your reason or suppose 
you be bewitch he with more potent spell 
and magical rite shall cure you be it heaven anger 
with penitence and sacrifice appease it 
beyond this there be nothing that I can 
imagine dreadful in your fame and fortune 
you be secure your impious son remove to 
that render you suspect to the state 
and your fair daughter 

o press i no far 

be you wring there why what of she have she 
make shipwreck of her honour or conspire 
against your life or seal a contract with 
the devil of hell for the recovery of her young inamorato 

none of these 
and yet what must increase the wonder in you 
be innocent in herself she have wound i 
but where inquire not yet I know not how 
I be persuade from my confidence 
of your vow love to i to trust you with 
my dear secret pray you chide i for it 
but with a kind of pity not insult 
on my calamity 

forward 

this same daughter 

what be her fault 

she be too fair to i 

Ha how be this 

and I have look upon she 
more than a father shall and languish to 
enjoy she as a husband 

heaven forbid it 

and this be all the comfort you can give i 
where be your promise aid your charm your herb 
your deep read scholar spell and magic rite 
can all these disenchant i no I must be 
my own physician and upon myself 
practise a desperate cure 

do not contemn I 
enjoin i what you please with any hazard 
I will undertake it what mean have you practice 
to quench this hellish fire 

all I can think on 
but to no purpose and yet sometime absence 
do yield a kind of intermission to 
the fury of the fit 

see she no more then 

it be my last refuge and it be my intent 
and still it be to desire your help 

command it 

thus then you have a fort of which you be 
the absolute lord whither I pray you bear she 
and that the sight of she may not again 
nourish those flame which I feel something lessen 
by all the tie of friendship I conjure you 
and by a solemn oath you must confirm it 
that though my now calm passion shall rage high 
than ever heretofore and so compel i 
once more to wish to see she though I use 
persuasion mix with threaten nay add to it 
that I this fail shall with hand hold up thus 
kneel at your foot and bathe they with my tear 
prayer or curse vow or imprecation 
only to look upon she though at distance 
you still must be obdurate 

if it be 
your pleasure sir that I shall be unmoved I will endeavour 

you must swear to be 
inexorable as you will prevent 
the great mischief to your friend that fate 
can throw upon he 

well I will obey you 
but how the governor will be answer yet 
and it be material be not consider 

leave that to i I will present give order 
how you shall surprise she be not fright with 
her exclamation 

be you constant to 
your resolution I will no fail 
in what concern my part 

be ever bless for it 

not to be speak with say you 

no 

nor you 
admit to have conference with she 

neither 
his door be fast lock up and solitude 
dwell round about they no access allow 
to friend or enemy but 

nay be not move sir 
let his passion work and like a hot rein horse 
it will quick tire itself 

or in his death 
which for her sake till now I have forbear 
I will revenge the injury he have do 
to my true and lawful love 

how do your father 
the governor relish it 

troth he never have 
affection to the match yet in his pity 
to i he be go in person to his house 
nor will he be deny and if he find not 
strong and fair reason Malefort will hear from he 
in a kind he do not look for 

in the mean time 
pray you put on cheerful look 

my suit my fortune 

o here be Montaigne 

I never can have meet you 
more opportune I will not stale the jest 
by my relation but if you will look on 
the malcontent Belgarde new rig up 
with the train that follow he it will be a object 
worthy of your note 

look you the comedy 
make good the prologue or the scorn will dwell 
upon yourself 

I will hazard that observe now 

nay captain glorious captain 

fall back rascal 
do you make a owl of i this day I will 
receive no more petition 
here be bill of all occasion and all fix 
if this be the pleasure of a rich suit will I be 
again in my buff jerkin or my armour 
than I walk secure by my creditor nose 
and not a dog mark i every officer shun i 
and not one lousy prison will receive i 
but now as the ballad say I be turn gallant 
there do not live that thing I owe a souse to 
but do torment i a faithful cobbler tell i 
with his awl in his hand I be behind hand with he 
for set i upright and bid i look to myself 
a sempstress too that trade but in sock 
swear she will set a sergeant on my back 
for a borrow shirt my pay and the benevolence 
the governor and the state bestow upon i 
the city cormorant my moneymonger 
have swallow down already they be sum 
I grant but that I shall be such a fool 
against my oath be a cashier captain 
to pay debt though grow up to one and twenty 
deserve more reprehension in my judgement 
than a shopkeeper or a lawyer that lend money 
in a long dead vacation 

how do you like 
his meditation

I can now go on the score for shame 
and where I shall begin to pawn I marry 
that be consider timely I pay for 
this train of you dame ostrich fourteen crown 
and yet it be so light it will hardly pass 
for a tavern reckon unless it be 
to save the charge of paint nail on a post 
for the sign of the feather pox upon the fashion 
that a captain can think himself a captain 
if he wear not this like a forehorse yet it be not 
staple commodity these be perfume too 
of the roman wash and yet a stale red herring 
will fill the belly better and hurt the head less 
and this be Venice gold will I have it again 
in french crown in my pocket o you commander 
that like i have no dead pa●es nor can cozen 
the commissary at a muster let i stand 
for a example to you as you will 
enjoy your privilege videlicet 
to pay your debt and take your lechery gratis 
to have your issue warm by other fire 
to be often drink and swear yet pay no forfeit 
to the poor but when you share with one another 
with all your other choice immunity 
only of this I serious advise you 
let courtier trip like courtier 
and your lord of dirt and dung hill meet 
their wood and acre in velvet satin tissue 
but keep you constant to do and chamois

in force and outrage upon what assurance 
remember only that my father live

hereafter be report to have be 
the principal occasion of your fall 
into a relapse or but suppose out of 
the easiness of my nature and assurance 
you be firm and can hold out I can consent 
you needs must know there be so many let 
that make against it that it be my wonder 
you offer i the motion have bind i 
with oath and imprecation on no term 
reason or argument you can propose 
I ever shall admit you to her sight 
Much less restore she to you 

be we soldier and stand on oath 

it be beyond my knowledge 
in what we be more worthy then in keep 
our word much more our vow 

heaven pardon all 
how many thousand in our heat of wine 
quarrel and play and in our young day 
in private I may say between ourselves 
in point of love have we to answer for 
shall we be scrupulous that way 

you say well 
and very apt call to memory 
two oath against all tie and rite of friendship 
break by you to i 

no more of that 

yes it be material and to the purpose 
the first and think upon it be when I bring you 
as a visitant to my mistress then the mother 
of this same daughter who with dreadful word 
too hideous to remember you swear deep 
for my sake never to attempt yet then 
then when you have a sweet wife of your own 
I know not with what art philtre and charm 
unless in wealth and fame you be above i 
you win she from i and her grant obtain 
a marriage with the second wait on 
the burial of the first that to the world 
bring your dead son this I sit tame down by 
want indeed occasion and power 
to be at the height revenge 

yet this you seem 
free to pardon 

as perhaps I do 
your daughter Theocrine grow ripe 
her mother too decease and fit for marriage 
I be a suitor for she have your word 
upon your honour and our friendship make 
authentical and ratify with a oath 
she shall be i but vow with you be like 
to your religion a nose of wax 
to be turn every way that very day 
the governor son but make his approach 
of courtship to she the wind of your ambition 
for her advancement scatter the thin sand 
in which you write your full consent to i 
and draw you to his party what have pass since 
you bear a register in your own bosom 
that can at large inform you 

Montrevile 
I do confess all that you charge i with 
to be strong truth and that I bring a cause 
most miserable guilty and acknowledge 
that though your goodness make i my own judge 
I shall not show the least compassion 
or mercy to myself o let not yet 
my foulness taint your pureness or my falsehood 
divert the torrent of your loyal faith 
my ill if not return by you will add 
lustre to your much good and to overcome 
with noble sufferance will express your strength 
and triumph over my weakness if you please to 
my black deed be only know to you 
and in surrender up my daughter bury 
you not alone make i your slave for I 
at no part do deserve the name of friend 
but in your own breast raise a monument 
of pity to a wretch on who with justice 
you may express all cruelty 

you much move i 

o that I can but hope it to revenge 
a injury be proper to the wish 
of feeble woman that want strength to act it 
but to have power to punish and yet pardon 
peculiar to prince see these knee 
that have be ever stiff to bend to heaven 
to you be supple be there aught beyond this 
that may speak my submission or can pride 
though I well know it be a stranger to you 
desire a feast of more humility 
to kill her grow appetite 

I require not 
to be seek to this poor way yet it be so far 
a kind of satisfaction that I will 
dispense a little with those serious oath 
you make i take your daughter shall come to you 
I will not say as you deliver she 
but as she be you may dispose of she 
as you shall think most requisite 

his last word be riddle to i 
here the lion force 
will have prove useless and against my nature 
compel i from the crocodile to borrow 
her counterfeit tear there  
may I but quench these fire that rage  the  
and fall what can fall I be arm to bear be 

you must be pack 

have he rob i of 
my honour and deny i now a room 
to hide my shame 

my lord the admiral 
attend your ladyship 

close the port and leave they 

ha who be this how alter how deform 
it can be and yet this creature have 
a kind of a resemblance to my daughter 
my Theocrine but as different 
from that she be as body dead be in 
their best perfection from what they be 
when they have life and motion 

it be most true fir 
I be dead indeed to all but misery 
o come not near i sir I be infectious 
to look on i at distance be as dangerous 
as from a pinnacle cloudkissing spire 
with giddy eye to view the steep descent 
but to acknowledge i a certain ruin 
o sir 

speak Theocrine force i not 
to far question my fear already 
have choke my vital spirit 

pray you turn away 
your face and hear i and with my last breath 
give i leave to accuse you what offence 
from my first infancy do I commit 
that for a punishment you shall give up 
my virgin chastity to the treacherous guard 
of goatish Montrevile 

what have be do 

abuse i fir by violence and this tell 
I can live to speak more may the cause 
in you find pardon but the speed curse 
of a ravish maid fall heavy heavy on he 
Beaufort my lawful love farewell for ever 

take not thy flight so soon immaculate spirit 
it be flee already how the innocent 
as in a gentle slumber pass away 
but to cut off the knotty thread of life 
in guilty man must force stern Atropos 
to use her sharp knife often I will help 
the edge of she with the sharp point of i 
but that I dare not die till I have rend 
this dog heart piecemeal o that I have wing 
to scale these wall or that my hand be canon 
to bore their flinty side that I may bring 
the villain in the reach of my good sword 
the turkish empire offer for his ransom 
shall not redeem his life o that my voice 
be loud as thunder and with horrid sound 
may force a dreadful passage to his ear 
and through they reach his soul libidinous monster 
foul ravisher as thou dare do a deed 
which force the sun to hide his glorious face 
behind a sable masque of cloud appear 
and as a man defend it or like i 
show some compunction for it 

ha ha ha 

be this a object to raise mirth

or if thou be the thing thou be report 
thou shall have lead the way do tear thy hair 
like a village nurse and mourn while I laugh at thou

and in a equal balance poise the nothing 
or little mischief I have do compare 
with the ponderous weight of thou and how can thou 
accuse or argue with i I be a rape 
and she be in a kind contract to i 
the fact may challenge some qualification 
but thy intent make nature self run backward 
and do have cause a earthquake

there can be a want of power above 
to punish murder and unlawful love
