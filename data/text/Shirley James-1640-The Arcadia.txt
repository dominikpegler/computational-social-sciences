the soft blow

to those that come to school to he instruct 
with handsome shadow to deceive the eye

a prince I must confess beside Gynoecia 
since I come hither I have have some sprinkle of 
I know not what affection to Philoclea 
for how can I imagine such a blessedness 
from you but if you mock not

o pardon the over charge Gynoecia 
who error may be yet make more excusable 
by the immortal name of love

have nothing but myself to give you for it 
a small but free gift bestow i as you please 

my soul be narrow to receive this wide blessing 

but i must be wise

Mine Palladius of Iberia

private person you may proceed 

I shall and with as much brevity 

choose who you will first accuse 

then first this Daiphantas this Zelmane 
this what you will for he have yet no name 
nor shape that we can trust to have knowledge 
of our late master solitary life 
come not without a purpose of this treachery 
and by the cunning of Gynoecia 
in the habit of a woman be receive 
as a unsuspected guest enjoy the freedom 
of those who the king place near his bosom 
his child not more dear treason thus fortify 
they soon conspire the death of this good king 
a cave this gentlewoman lodging be 
the fatal scene where the unhappy queen 
by his direction force his dear life from he 
I omit what lustful motive prompt she 
that with more licence she may twine with this 
hermaphrodite and that they have appoint 
where they may meet when this black deed be do 
but heaven be merciful and prevent her 
flight by the happy come in of shepherd 
in the mean time transport with the confidence 
of her performance that he may not leave 
any revenger of this hateful murder 
he hasty make up to Philoclea chamber 
whereby the mingle what he can her shame 
with his offence he easy may enforce 
she to be accessary to her father death 
and under her protection and her sister 
against who they know we be not to rebel 
seize with one gripe the state but heaven preserve 
all by the unexpected come up 
of this Dametas 

yes heaven and I preserve all 

who seek then for Pamela 
which the other princely thief have steal away 
and find these I mean Philoclea 
and this young man together find occasion 
to enclose the ravisher till by command 
they be apprehend thus you have in short 
his wicked story and what punishment 
will not be think a mercy to that monster 
that kill a king dishonour a queen 
and violate the daughter 

in thing promote with such cunning mixture 
it be hard to shape a square and direct answer 
my accuser sordid and malicious rail 
more grievous to my tender sense of honour 
then death can be I forget he 
a thing beneath my anger and arm with 
my own simplicity doubt not to assure 
how much my cause be injure know grave judge 
this prince and I draw hither by the fame 
of the rare beauty in Basilius daughter 
know that with their parent they live here 
seclude from the world where no access 
in our own person be to be expect 
put on these form as soon may conduce 
to make our love know this Palladius 
become so fortunate that his princely mistress 
consent to forsake and trust his conduct 
to a happy kingdom my fortune 
be not so happy for I do not cherish 
a great flame yet modest of Philoclea 
then her weak father in my sex deceive 
retain of i that tire with his solicit 
I have no time to perfect my desire 
with his fair daughter 
till under colour of some devotion 
I make a cave my lodging to invite 
Basilius thither with full hope to enjoy i 
but this reveal to the queen she take 
my place to make the old king see his folly 
in the mean time I must confess I go 
to bright Philoclea chamber hope to 
win she by all the charm of noble love 
to leave Arcadia but she unhappy 
obey her own genius give no 
consent when in the midst of my security 
I know not by what mean I be make prisoner 
and here be the thread to guide through this labyrinth 
methinks your man of mighty tongue shall blush 
to have spend his rage so poor 

what ic all this to the death of the old king 

by all the god I be innocent 
the queen have absolve i as for Philoclea 
if you will call it a crime in that I love she 
I be and shall be guilty but have never 
a thought so rude to force her unstained chastity 
or if the honour of this excellent lady 
suffer in the blind opinion of the world 
our marriage not my death may cure all wound 
malice can fasten on her name 

o impudence 

if this be all you have to say proceed 
to his confederate 

the imagination how miserable 
these juggler will have make we and our country 
if their disguise have prosper strike a terror 
through all my faculty my tongue be enfeeble 
therefore to omit his practice in the murder 
which you may easy collect by circumstance 
this be enough to call he a foul traitor 
he do attempt to steal a way out princess 
the hope and treasure of Arcadia 
and take in the fact dare not deny it 
have he no other cry i to answer for 
this pull severe death on he and to insist 
upon offence of so foul a nature 
be to distrust your wisdom or your justice 
thou to their shame of mankind speak to this 

not for thy sake who in this misery 
have only merit to be my scorn 
but for the truth I answer pardon sir 
if passion make i not remember language 
that shall become this place this ill tongue man 
that with such vehemence accuse thus 
be himself guilty 

how 

of a more hateful vice ingratitude 
be this the payment for our service 
which once thy tongue acknowledge have deserve 
statue to the eternal memory 
of the preserver of your king and country 
be all the valour of this young man cancel 
when rebel have advance their dare sword 
high as the throat of your old king his wife 
and tremble daughter be the time forget 
when wild beast have prepare their riotous maw 
to bury the dear pledge of your kingdom 
o where have be my treason or his rape 
have they be then devour the ground have not 
drink up the blood so perfect but there 
remain a colour to teach impious man 
to blush for their ingratitude have we 
be careless of our life to preserve 
the king when danger threaten horror to he 
and can a temperate man imagine we 
shall be his murderer we have not save 
to be ourselves the hangman but I be charge 
for steal of your princess can your breath 
acknowledge she your sovereign and allow 
no faith to what she say you have degrade 
my blood from honour and unless you make i 
less than her subject I be bind to obey 
when she command I shall wait upon she 
but you will object I counsel she I do 
and justify the act she be confine 
too narrow and I dare lead she to 
a throne above the majesty her birth 
can challenge in Arcadia love who force 
the god have not resist may plead for i 

be this all 

though it want method it be enough to vindicate 
my honour from his base aspersion 

to he you call Dametas 

not guilty my lord as I hope to be save not guilty 

neglect of the great charge with which the king 
our master trust he sum up his fault 

I be make a goldfinder I desire justice for he and 
mercy for myself 

silence 

I have hear you with attention and whereas 
to the king death the unhappy cause of this 
assembly you have answer with denial 
which you think fortify by the queen 
self only accusation I must tell you 
it free you not for though no manifest proof 
yet circumstance well examine make you 
the accidental cause of his murder 
for the other part of your offence I find not 
you have deny your guilt but only use 
qualification and excuse your service 
in themselves high and honourable allow you 
no privilege to offend but give your black fault 
a black die then just weigh your offence you meet 
in equal guilt for though you first convey 
away Pamela his intention be 
early as you and by the rule of justice 
the will stand for the act both ravish 
although not of the lady from themselves 
yet from their parent and their country which 
by all the grecian law be pay with death 
thus then I must pronounce Daiphantas shall 
be throw from some high tower to mere his death 
Palladius lose his head before sunset 
the executioner shall be Dametas 
which office of the common hangman he 
shall for his whole life execute a punishment 
for his neglect of duty 

must I be hangman o brave heaven preserve your lordship I shall quick learn the trade and if ever any of your honour have occasion to use i I will owe you a good turn and in token I have be bind to you the knot of my dutiful affection shall tell a tale in your ear you shall thank i when you be hang come your way but I beseech your lordship I may be allow a man some time I will be loath to hang or to behead myself my wife or my own kindred but if it happen there be more work than he can turn his hand to I will not stick with he to hang myself provide you malefactor and let i alone for halter
