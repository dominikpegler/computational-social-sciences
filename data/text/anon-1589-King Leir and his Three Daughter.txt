thus to our grief the obsequy perform 
of our too late decease and dear queen 
who soul I hope possess of heavenly joy 
do ride in triumph among the cherubin 
let we request your grave advice my lord 
for the dispose of our princely daughter 
for who our care be special employ 
as nature bind to advance their state 
in royal marriage with some princely mate 
for want now their mother good advice 
under who government they have receive 
a perfect pattern of a virtuous life 
leave as it be a ship without a stern 
or silly sheep without a pastor care 
although ourselves do dear tender they 
yet be we ignorant of their affair 
for father best do know to govern son 
but daughter step the mother counsel turn 
a son we want for to succeed our crown 
and course of time have cancel the date 
of further issue from our wither loin 
one foot already hang in the grave 
and age have make deep furrow in my face 
the world of i I of the world be weary 
and I will fain resign these earthly care 
and think upon the welfare of my soul 
which by no better mean may be effect 
then by resign up the crown from i 
in equal dowry to my daughter three 

a worthy care my liege which well declare 
the zeal you bear unto our quondam queen 
and since your grace have license i to speak 
I censure thus your majesty know well 
what several suitor your princely daughter have 
to make they each a jointure more or less 
as be their worth to they that love profess 

no more nor less but even all alike 
my zeal be fix all fashion in one mould 
wherefore unpartial shall my censure be 
both old and young shall have alike for i 

my gracious lord I hearty do wish 
that God have lend you a heir indubitate 
which may have sit upon your royal throne 
when fate shall lose the prison of your life 
by who succession all this doubt may cease 
and as by you by he we may have peace 
but afterwish ever come too late 
and nothing can revoke the course of fate 
wherefore my liege my censure deem it best 
to match they with some of your neighbour king 
border within the bound of Albion 
by who unite friendship this our state 
may be protect against all foreign hate 

herein my lord your wish sort with i 
and i I hope do sort with heavenly power 
for at this instant two near neighbour king 
of Cornwall and of Cambria motion love 
to my two daughter Goneril and Ragan 
my young daughter fair Cordelia vow 
no like to a monarch unless love allow 
she be solicit by diverse peer 
but none of they her partial fancy hear 
yet if my policy may she beguile 
I will match she to some king within this isle 
and so establish such a perfect peace 
as fortune force shall never prevail to cease 

of we and we your gracious care my lord 
deserve a everlasting memory 
to be enrol in chronicle of fame 
by neverdying perpetuity 
yet to become so provident a prince 
lose not the title of a love father 
do not force love where fancy can dwell 
lest stream be stop above the bank do swell 

I be resolve and even now my mind 
do meditate a sudden stratagem 
to try which of my daughter love i best 
which till I know I can be in rest 
This grant when they joint shall contend 
each to exceed the other in their love 
then at the vantage will I take Cordelia 
even as she do protest she love i best 
I will say then daughter grant i one request 
to show thou love i as thy sister do 
accept a husband who myself will woo 
This say she can well deny my suit 
although poor soul her sense will be mute 
then will I triumph in my policy 
and match she with a king of Brittany 

I will to they before and bewray your secrecy 

thus father think their child to beguile 
and oftentimes themselves do first repent 
when heavenly power do frustrate their intent 

I marvel Ragan how you can endure 
to see that proud pert pet our young sister 
so slight to account of we her elder 
as if we be no better than herself 
we can have a quaint device so soon 
or new make fashion of our choice invention 
but if she like it she will have the same 
or study new to exceed we both 
beside she be so nice and so demure 
so sober courteous modest and precise 
that all the court have work enough to do 
to talk how she exceed i and you 

what shall I do will it be in my power 
to find a cure for this contagious ill 
some desperate medicine must be soon apply 
to dim the glory of her mount fame 
else ere it be long she will have both prick and praise 
and we must be set by for work day 
do you not see what several choice of suitor 
she daily have and of the best degree 
say among all she hap to fancy one 
and have a husband whenas we have none 
why then by right to she we must give place 
though it be never so much to our disgrace 

by my virginity rather than she shall have 
a husband before i 
I will marry one or other in his shirt 
and yet I have make half a grant already 
of my good will unto the king of Cornwall 

swear not so deep sister here come my L Scaliger 
Something his hasty come do import 

sweet princess I be glad I meet you here so lucky 
have good news which do concern you both 
and crave speedy expedition 

for god sake tell we what it be my lord 
I be with child until you utter it 

madam to save your longing this it be 
your father in great secrecy today 
tell i he mean to marry you out of hand 
unto the noble prince of Cambria 
you madam to the king of Cornwall grace 
your young sister he will fain bestow 
upon the rich king of Hibernia 
but that he doubt she hardly will consent 
for hitherto she never can fancy he 
if she do yield why then between you three 
he will divide his kingdom for your dowry 
but yet there be a further mystery 
which so you will conceal I will disclose 

whatever thou speak to we kind Scaliger 
think that thou speak it only to thyself 

he earnest desire for to know 
which of you three do bear most love to he 
and on your love he so extreme dote 
as never any do I think before 
he present do mean to send for you 
to be resolve of this torment doubt 
and look who answer please he the best 
they shall have most unto their marriage 

o that I have some please mermaid voice 
for to inchant his senseless sense with 

for he suppose that Cordelia will 
strive to go beyond you in her love 
promise to do whatever he desire 
then will he straight enjoin she for his sake 
the hibernian king in marriage for to take 
this be the sum of all I have to say 
which be do I humble take my leave 
not doubt but your wisdom will foresee 
what course will best unto your good agree 

thank gentle Scaliger thy kindness undeserved 
shall not be unrequited if we live 

now have we fit occasion offer we 
to be revenge upon her unperceived 

nay our revenge we will inflict on she 
shall be account piety in we 
I will so flatter with my dote father 
as he be never so flatter in his life 
nay I will say that if it be his pleasure 
to match i to a beggar I will yield 
for why I know whatever I do say 
he mean to match i with the Cornwall king 

I will say the like for I be well assure 
whatever I say to please the old man mind 
who dote as if he be a child again 
I shall enjoy the noble cambrian prince 
only to feed his humour will suffice 
to say I be content with any one 
who he will appoint i this will please he more 
then ever Apollo music please jove 

I smile to think in what a woeful plight 
Cordelia will be when we answer thus 
for she will rather die then give consent 
to join in marriage with the irish king 
so will our father think she love he not 
because she will not grant to his desire 
which we will aggravate in such bitter term 
that he will soon convert his love to hate 
for he you know be always in extreme 

not all the world can lay a better plot 
I long till it be put in practice 

Perillus go seek my daughter 
will they immediate come and speak with i 

I will my gracious lord 

o what a combat feel my pant heart 
betwixt child love and care of common weal 
how dear my daughter be unto my soul 
none know but he that know my thought and secret deed 
ah little do they know the dear regard 
wherein I hold their future state to come 
when they secure sleep on bed of down 
these age eye do watch for their behalf 
while they like wanton sport in youthful toy 
this throb heart be pierce with dire annoy 
as do the sun exceed the small star 
so much the father love exceed the child 
yet my complaint be causeless for the world 
afford not child more conformable 
and yet methinks my mind presage still 
I know not what and yet I fear some ill

a present mean to rid i of this doubt 

our royal lord and father in all duty 
we come to know the tenor of your will 
why you so hasty have send for we 

dear Goneril kind Ragan sweet Cordelia 
you flourish branch of a kingly stock 
spring from a tree that once do flourish green 
who blossom now be nip with winter frost 
and pale grim death do wait upon my step 
and summons i unto his next assize 
therefore dear daughter as you tender the safety 
of he that be the cause of your first be

which of you three to i will prove most kind 
which love i most and which at my request 
will soon yield unto their father hest

of any of his daughter love to he

the high turret in all Brittany 
and from the top leap headlong to the ground

in brief command whatever you desire 
and if I fail no favour I require 

o how thy word revive my die soul 

o how I do abhor this flattery 

but what say Ragan to her father will 

o that my simple utterance can suffice 
to tell the true intention of my heart 
which burn in zeal of duty to your grace 
and never can be quench but by desire 
to show the same in outward forwardness 
o that there be some other maid that dare 
but make a challenge of her love with i 
I will make she soon confess she never love 
her father half so well as I do you 
ay then my deed shall prove in plain case 
how much my zeal abound to your grace 
but for they all let this one mean suffice 
to ratify my love before your eye 
I have right noble suitor to my love 
no worse than king and happy I love one 
yet will you have i make my choice anew 
I will bridle fancy and be rule by you 

do never Philomela sing so sweet a note

and so be you but do thou know proud girl

of these three nymph the daughter of king Leir 
if present view do answer absent praise 
and eye allow of what our ear have hear 
and Venus stand auspicious to my vow 
and fortune favour what I take in hand

as jason when he win the golden fleece 

heaven grant you may the match be full of honour 
and well beseem the young gallian king 
I will your grace will favour i so much 
as make i partner of your pilgrimage 
I long to see the gallant british dame 
and feed my eye upon their rare perfection 
for till I know the contrary I will say 
our dame in France be far more fair than they 

lord Mumford you have save i a labour 
in offer that which I do mean to ask 
and I most willing accept your company 
yet first I will enjoin you to observe 
some few condition which I shall propose 

so that you do not tie my eye for look 
after the amorous glance of fair dame 
so that you do not tie my tongue from speak 
my lip from kiss when occasion serve 
my hand from congee and my knee to bow 
to gallant girl which be a task more hard 
then flesh and blood be able to endure 
command what else you please I rest content 

to bind thou from a thing thou can not leave 
be but a mean to make thou seek it more 
and therefore speak look kiss salute for i 
in these myself be like to second thou 
now hear thy task I charge thou from the time 
that first we set sail for the british shore 
to use no word of dignity to i 
but in the friendly manner that thou can 
make use of i as thy companion 
for we will go disguise in palmer weed 
that no man shall mistrust we what we be 

if that be all I will fit your turn I warrant you I be some kin to the Blunt and I think the blunt of all my kindred therefore if I be too blunt with you thank yourself for pray i to be so 

thy pleasant company will make the way see i short

I do commit the government to you 
my trusty lord and faithful counsellor 
time cut off the rest I have to say 
the wind blow fair and I must needs away 

heaven send your voyage to as good effect 
as we your land do purpose to protect 

but how far distant be we from the court 

some twenty mile my lord or thereabouts 

it seem to i twenty thousand mile 
yet hope I to be there within this hour 

then be you like to ride alone for i 
I think my lord be weary of his life 

sweet Goneril I long to see thy face 
which have so kind gratify my love 

get a fresh horse for by my soul I swear 
I be past patience long to forbear 
the wish sight of my belove mistress 
dear Ragan stay and comfort of my life 

now what in God name do my lord intend 
he think he never shall come at we journey end 
I will he have old Dedalus waxen wing 
that he may fly so I may stay behind 
for ere we get to Troynovant I see 
he quite will tire himself his horse and i 

brother of Cambria we greet you well 
as one who here we little do expect 

brother of Cornwall meet in happy time 
I think as much to have meet with the sultan of Persia 
as to have meet you in this place my lord 
no doubt it be about some great affair 
that make you here so slender accompany 

to say the truth my lord it be no less 
and for your part some hasty wind of chance 
have blow you hither thus upon the sudden 

my lord to break off further circumstance 
for at this time I can brook delay 
tell you your reason I will tell you i 

in faith content and therefore to be brief 
for I be sure my haste be as great as you 
I be send for to come unto king Leir 
who by these present letter promise 
his old daughter lovely Goneril 
to i in marriage and for present dowry 
the moiety of half his regiment 
the lady love I long ago possess 
but until now I never have the father 

you tell i wonder yet I will relate 
strange news and henceforth we must brother call 
witness these line his honourable age 
be weary of the trouble of his crown 
his princely daughter Ragan will bestow 
on i in marriage with half his signory 
who I will glad have accept of 
with the three part her compliment be such 

if I have one half and you have the other 
then between we we must needs have the whole 

the hole how mean you that zlood I hope 
we shall have two hole between we 

why the whole kingdom 

ay that be very true 

what then be leave for his three daughter dowry 
lovely Cordelia who the world admire 

it be very strange I know not what to think 
unless they mean to make a nun of she 

it be pity such rare beauty shall be hide 
within the compass of a cloister wall 
but howsoever if Leir word prove true 
it will be good my lord for i and you 

then let we haste all danger to prevent 
for fear delay do alter his intent 

sister when do you see Cordelia last 
that pretty piece that think none good enough 
to speak to she because sirreverence 
she have a little beauty extraordinary 

since time my father warn she from his presence 
I never see she that I can remember 
God giver her joy of her surpass beauty 
I think her dowry will be small enough 

I have incense my father so against she 
as he will never be reclaim again 

I be not much behind to do the like 

faith sister what move you to bear she such good will 

in truth I think the same that move you 
because she do surpass we both in beauty 

beshrew your finger how right you can guess 
I tell you true it cut i to the heart 

but we will keep her low enough I warrant 
and clip her wing for mount up too high 

whoever have her shall have a rich marriage of she 

she be right fit to make a parson wife 
for they man say do love fair woman well 
and many time do marry they with nothing 

with nothing marry God forbid why be there any such 

I mean no money 

I cry you mercy I mistake you much 
and she be far too stately for the church 
she will lay her husband benefice on her back 
even in one gown if she may have her will 

in faith poor soul I pity she a little 
will she be less fair or more fortunate 
well I think long until I see my Morgan 
the gallant prince of Cambria here arrive 

and so do I until the Cornwall king 
present himself to consummate my joy 
peace here come my father 

cease good my lord and sue not to reverse 
our censure which be now irrevocable 
we have dispatch letter of contract 
unto the king of Cambria and of Cornwall 
our hand and seal will justify no less 
then do not so dishonour i my lord 
as to make shipwreck of our kingly word 
I be as kind as be the pelican 
that kill itself to save her young one live 
and yet as jealous as the princely eagle 
that kill her young one if theydo but dazzle 
upon the radiant splendour of the sun 
within this two day I expect their come 
but in good time they be arrive already 
this haste of you my lord do testify 
the fervent love you bear unto my daughter 
and think yourselves as welcome to king Leir 
as ever Priam child be to he 

my gracious lord and father too I hope 
pardon for that I make no great haste 
but be my horse as swift as be my will 
I long ere this have see your majesty 

no other excuse of absence can I frame 
then what my brother have inform your grace 
for our undeserved welcome we do vow 
perpetual to rest at your command 

but you sweet love illustrious Goneril 
the regent and the sovereign of my soul 
be Cornwall welcome to your excellency

or brave Aeneas to the Carthage queen 
so and more welcome be your grace to i 

o may my fortune prove no worse than he 
since heaven do know my fancy be as much 
dear Ragan say if welcome unto thou 
all welcome else will little comfort i

as sleep be welcome to the traveller 
as be fresh water to seabeaten man 
or moisten shower unto the parch ground 
or any thing more welcome than this 
so and more welcome lovely Morgan be 

what rest then but that we consummate 
the celebration of these nuptial rite

and here I do free dispossess myself 
and make you two my true adopt heir

and take i to my prayer and my bead 
I know my daughter Ragan will be sorry 
because I do not spend my day with she 
will I be able to be with both at once 
they be the kind girl in christendom 

I have be silent all this while my lord 
to see if any worthy than myself 
will once have speak in poor Cordelia cause 
but love or fear tie silence to their tongue 
o hear i speak for she my gracious lord 
who deed have not deserve this ruthless doom 
as thus to disinherit she of all 

urge this no more and if thou love thy life 
I say she be no daughter that do scorn 
to tell her father how she love he 
whoever speak hereof to i again 
I will esteem he for my mortal foe 
Come let we in to celebrate with joy 
the happy nuptial of these lovely pair

my lord again than let we have nothing else 
and so be take for spy and then it be well

wherein they both be marry unto king 
and I by birth as worthy as themselves 
be turn into the world to seek my fortune 
how may I blame the fickle queen of chance 
that make i a pattern of her power 
ah poor weak maid who imbecility 
be far unable to endure these brunt 
o father Leir how do thou wrong thy child 
who always be obedient to thy will 
but why accuse I fortune and my father 
no no it be the pleasure of my god 
and I do willing embrace the rod 

it be no goddess for she do complaint 
on fortune and the unkindnes of her father 

these costly robe ill fit my estate 
I will exchange for other mean habit 

now if I have a kingdom in my hand 
I will exchange it for a milkmaid smock and petticoat 
that she and I may shift our clothes together 

I will betake i to my thread and needle 
and earn my living with my finger end 

o brave God will thou shall have my custom 
by sweet S Denis here I sad swear 
for all the shirt and night gear that I wear 

I will profess and vow a maiden life 

than I protest thou shall not have my custom 

I can forbear no long for to speak 
for if I do I think my heart will break 

'sblood Will I hope you be not in love with my sempster 

I be in such a labyrinth of love 
as that I know not which way to get out 

you will never get out unless you first get in 

I prithee Jack cross not my passion 

prithee Will to she and try her patience 

thou fair creature whatsoever thou be 
that ever any mortal eye be hold 
vouchsafe to i who have overhear thy woe 
to show the cause of these thy sad lament 

ah pilgrim what avail to show the cause 
when there be no mean to find a remedy 

to utter grief do ease a heart over charge 

to touch a sore do aggravate the pain 

the silly mouse by virtue of her tooth 
release the princely lion from the net 

kind palmer which so much desire to hear 
the tragic tale of my unhappy youth 
know this in brief I be the hapless daughter 
of Leir sometime king of brittany 

why who debar his honourable age 
from be still the king of Brittany 

None but himself have dispossess himself 
and give all his kingdom to the king 
of Cornwall and of Cambria with my sister 

have he give nothing to your lovely self 

he love i not and therefore give i nothing 
only because I can not flatter he 
and in this day of triumph to my sister 
do fortune triumph in my overthrow 

sweet lady say there shall come a king 
as good as either of your sister husband 
to crave your love will you accept of he 

o do not mock with those in misery 
nor do not think though fortune have the power 
to spoil my honour and debase my state 
that she have any interest in my mind 
for if the great monarch on the earth 
shall sue to i in this extremity 
except my heart can love and heart can like 
better than any that I ever see 
his great estate no more shall move my mind 
than mountain move by blast of every wind 

think not sweet nymph it be holy palmer guise 
to grieve soul fresh torment to devise 
therefore in witness of my true intent 
let heaven and earth bear record of my word 
there be a young and lusty gallian king 
so like to i as I be to myself 
that earnest do crave to have thy love 
and join with thou in Hymen sacred bond 

the like to thou do never these eye behold 
o live to add new torment to my grief 
why do thou thus entrap i unaware 
ah palmer my estate do not befit 
a kingly marriage as the case now stand 
whilom whenas I live in honour height 
a prince perhaps may postulate my love 
now misery dishonour and disgrace 
have light on i and quite reverse the case 
thy king will hold thou wise if thou surcease 
the suit whereas no dowry will ensue 
then be advise palmer what to do 
cease for thy king seek for thyself to woo 

your birth be too high for any but a king 

my mind be low enough to love a palmer 
rather than any king upon the earth 

o but you never can endure their life 
which be so straight and full of penury 

o yes I can and happy if I may 
I will hold thy palmer staff within my hand 
and think it be the sceptre of a queen 
sometime I will set thy bonnet on my head 
and think I wear a rich imperial crown 
sometime I will help thou in thy holy prayer 
and think I be with thou in paradise 
thus I will mock fortune as she mock i 
and never will my lovely choice repent 
for have thou I shall have all content 

it be sin to hold she long in suspense 
since that my soul have vow she shall be i 
ah dear Cordelia cordial to my heart 
I be no palmer as I seem to be 
but hither come in this unknown disguise 
to view the admire beauty of those eye 
I be the king of Gallia gentle maid 
although thus slender accompany 
and yet thy vassal by imperious love 
and swear to serve thou everlasting

that swear without exception I will have you 
these foppet that know not whether to love a man or no except they first go ask their mother leave by this hand I hate they ten time worse than poison 

what rest then our happiness to procure 

faith go to church to make the matter sure 

it shall be so because the world shall say

the king have dispossess himself of all 
those to advance which scarce will give he thank 
his young daughter he have turn away 
and no man know what be become of she 
he sojourn now in Cornwall with the old 
who flatter he until she do obtain 
that at his hand which now she do possess 
and now she see he have no more to give 
it grieve her heart to see her father live 
o who shall man trust in this wicked age 
when child thus against their parent rage 
but he the mirror of mild patience 
put up all wrong and never give reply 
yet shame she not in most opprobrious sort 
to call he fool and dotard to his face 
and set her parasite of purpose oft 
in scoff wise to offer he disgrace 
o iron age o time o monstrous vild 
when parent be contemn of the child 
his pension she have half restrain from he 
and will ere long the other half I fear 
for she think nothing be bestow in vain 
but that which do her father life maintain 
trust not alliance but trust stranger rather 
since daughter prove disloyal to the father 
well I will counsel he the best I can 
will I be able to redress his wrong

endure such quip and peremptory taunt 
as I do daily from my dote father 
do it not suffice that I he keep of alm 
who be not able for to keep himself 
but as if he be our better he shall think 
to check and snap i up at every word 
I can make i a new fashion gown 
and set it forth with more than common cost 
but his old dote doltish wither wit 
be sure to give a senseless check for it 
I can make a banquet extraordinary 
to grace myself and spread my name abroad 
but he old fool be captious by and by 
and say the cost will well suffice for twice 
judge then I pray what reason be it that I 
shall stand alone charge with his vain expense 
and that my sister Ragan shall go free 
to who he give as much as unto i

but we the world do this experience give 
that he that can flatter can live

to cease the effect where first the cause begin 

sweet be not angry in a partial cause

Alas not I poor soul she breed young bone 
and that be it make she so tuteliy sure

o vild old wretch whoever hear the like 
that seek thus his own child to defame 

I can stay to hear this discord sound

to sow the seed of discord and disgrace 

thus say or do the best that ever I can

and more than this ten thousand thousand time 
else age Leir they can never find 
cruel to he to who he have be kind 
why do I overlive myself to see 
the course of nature quite reverse in i 
ah gentle death if ever any wight 
do wish thy presence with a perfect zeal 
then come I pray thou even with all my heart 
and end my sorrow with thy fatal dart 

ah do not so disconsolate yourself 
nor dew your age cheek with waste tear 

what man be thou that take any pity 
upon the worthless state of old Leir 

one who do be be as great a share of grief 
as if it be my dear father case 

ah good my friend how ill be thou advise 
for to consort with miserable man 
go learn to flatter where thou may in time 
get favour among the mighty and so climb 
for now I be so poor and full of want 
as that I never can recompense thy love 

what be get by flattery do not long endure 
and man in favour live not most secure 
my conscience tell i if I shall forsake you 
I be the hateful excrement on the earth 
which well do know in course of former time 
how good my lord have be to i and i 

do I ever raise thou high than the rest 
of all thy ancestor which be before 

I never do seek it but by your good grace 
I still enjoy my own with quietness

the due revenue which thy father leave 

I have enough my lord and have that 
what shall you need to give i any more 

o do I ever dispossess myself 
and give thou half my kingdom in good will 

Alas my lord there be no reason why 
you shall have such a thought to give it i 

nay if thou talk of reason then be mute 
for with good reason I can thou confute 
if they which first by nature sacred law 
do owe to i the tribute of their life 
if they to who I always have be kind 
and bountiful beyond comparison 
if they for who I have undo myself 
and bring my age unto this extreme want 
do now reject contemn despise abhor i 
what reason move thou to sorrow for i 

where reason fail let tear confirm my love 
and speak how much your passion do i move 
ah good my lord condemn not all for one 
you have two daughter leave to who I know 
you shall be welcome if you please to go 

o how thy word add sorrow to my soul 
to think of my unkindness to Cordelia 
who causeless I do dispossess of all 
upon the unkind suggestion of her sister 
and for her sake I think this heavy doom 
be fall on i and not without desert 
yet unto Ragan be I always kind 
and give to she the half of all I have 
it may be if I shall to her repair 
she will be kind and entreat i fair 

no doubt she will and practise ere it be long 
by force of arm for to redress your wrong 

well since thou do advise i for to go 
I be resolve to try the worst of woe 

how may I bless the hour of my nativity 
which bode unto i such happy star 
how may I thank kind fortune that vouchsafe 
to all my action such desire event 
I rule the king of Cambria as I please 
the state be all obedient to my will 
and look whatever I say it shall be so 
not any one that dare answer no 
my elder sister live in royal state 
and want nothing fit she degree 
yet have she such a cool card withal 
as that her honey savour much of gall 
my father with she be quartermaster still 
and many time restrain she of her will 
but if he be with i and serve i so 
I will send he pack somewhere else to go 
I will entertain he with such slender cost 
that he shall quick wish to change his host 

ah Goneril what dire unhappy chance 
have sequester thy father from our presence 
that no report can yet be hear of he 
some great unkindness have be offer he 
exceed far the bound of patience 
else all the world shall never i persuade 
he will forsake we without notice make 

Alas my lord who do it touch so near 
or who have interest in this grief but I 
who sorrow have bring to her long home 
but that I know his quality so well 
I know he be but steal upon my sister 
at unaware to see she how she fare 
and spend a little time with she to note 
how all thing go and how she like her choice 
and when occasion serve he will steal from she 
and unaware return to we again 
therefore my lord be frolic and resolve 
to see my father here again ere long 

I hope so too but yet to be more sure 
I will send a post immediate to know 
whether he be arrive there or no 

but I will intercept the messenger 
and temper he before he do depart 
with sweet persuasion and with sound reward 
that his report shall ratify my speech 
and make my lord cease further to inquire 
if he be not go to my sister court 
as sure my mind presage that he be 
he happy may by travel unknown way 
fall sick and as a common passenger 
be dead and bury will God it be so well 
for then there be no more to do but this 
he go away and none know where he be 
but say he be in Cambria with the king 
and there exclaim against i as he will 
I know he be as welcome to my sister 
as water be into a break ship 
well after he I will send such thunderclap 
of slander scandal and invent tale 
that all the blame shall be remove from i 
and unperceived rebound upon himself 
thus with one nail another I will expel 
and make the world judge that I use he well 

my honest friend whither away so fast

in token of further employment take that 

a strong bond a firm obligation good in law good in law if I keep not the condition let my neck be the forfeiture of my negligence 

I like thou well thou have a good tongue 

and as bad a tongue if it be set on it as any oysterwife at Billingsgate have why I have make many of my neighbour forsake their house with rail upon they and go dwell else where and so by my mean house have be good cheap in our parish my tongue be well whet with choler be more sharp than a razor of Palerno 

o thou be a fit man for my purpose

yet thou must affirm they to be true 
with oath and protestation as will serve 
to drive my sister out of love with he 
and cause my will accomplish to be 
this do thou win my favour for ever 
and make a high way of preferment to thou 
and all thy friend

I will so tonguewhip he that I will

Few word be best in so small a matter

I have be overnegligent today 
in go to the temple of my god 
to render thank for all his benefit 
which he miraculous have bestow on i 
in raise i out of my mean estate 
whenas I be devoid of worldly friend 
and place i in such a sweet content 
as far exceed the reach of my desert 
my kingly husband mirror of his time 
for zeal for justice kindness and for care 
to God his subject i and common weal 
by his appointment be ordain for i 
I can with the thing that I do want 
I can want the thing but I may have 
save only this which I shall never obtain 
my father love o this I never shall gain 
I will abstain from any nutriment 
and pine my body to the very bone 
bare foot I will on pilgrimage set forth 
unto the further quarter of the earth 
and all my life time will I sackcloth wear 
and mourningwise pour dust upon my head 
so he but to forgive i once will please 
that his grey hair may go to heaven in peace 
and yet I know not how I he offend 
or wherein just I have deserve blame 
o sister you be much to blame in this

nay rest on i kind friend and stay thyself

through these uncouth path and tireful way 
and never ease thy faint limb a whit 
thou have leave all ay all to come with i 
and I for all have nought to guerdon thou 

cease good my lord to aggravate my woe 
with these kind word which cut my heart in two 
to think your will shall want the power to do 

cease good Perillus for to call i lord 
and think i but the shadow of myself 

that honourable title will I give 
unto my lord so long as I do live 
o be of comfort for I see the place 
whereas your daughter keep her residence 
and lo in happy time the cambrian prince 
be here arrive to gratify our come 

be I best speak or sit i down and die 
I be ashamed to tell this heavy tale 

then let i tell it if you please my lord 
it be shame for they that be the cause thereof 

what two old man be those that seem so sad 
methinks I shall remember well their look 

no I mistake not sure it be my father 
I must dissemble kindness now of force 
father I bid you welcome full of grief 
to see your grace use thus unworthy 
and ill befit for your reverend age 
to come on foot a journey so endurable 
o what disaster chance have be the cause 
to make your cheek so hollow spare and lean 
he can speak for weep for god love come 
let we refresh he with some needful thing 
and at more leisure we may better know 
whence spring the ground of this unlooked for woe 

Come father ere we any further talk 
you shall refresh you after this weary walk 

come he to i with finger in the eye 
to tell a tale against my sister here 
who I do know he great have abuse 
and now like a contentious crafty wretch 
he first begin for to complain himself 
whenas himself be in the great fault 
I will not be partial in my sister cause 
nor yet believe his dote vain report 
who for a trifle safe I dare say 
upon a spleen be steal thence away 
and here forsooth he hope to have harbour 
and to be moan and make on like a child 
but ere it be long his come he shall curse 
and true say he come from bad to worse 
yet will I make fair weather to procure 
convenient mean and then I will strike it sure 

now happy I be arrive here 
before the stately palace of the cambrian king 
if Leir be here safeseated and in rest 
to rouse he from it I will do my best 
now bag of gold your virtue be no doubt 
to make i in my message bold and stout 
the king of heaven preserve your majesty 
and send your highness everlasting reign 

thank good my friend but what import thy message message 

kind greeting from the Cornwall queen 
the residue these letter will declare 

how fare our royal sister 

I do leave she at my part in good health 
see how her colour come and go again 
now red as scarlet now as pale as ash 
she how she knit her brow and bite her lip 
and stamp and make a dumb show of disdain 
mix with revenge and violent extreme 
here will be more work and more crown for i 

Alas poor soul and have he use she thus 
and be he now come hither with intent 
to set divorce betwixt my lord and i 
do he give out that he do hear report 
that I do rule my husband as I list 
and therefore mean to alter so the case 
that I shall know my lord to be my head 
well it be best for he to take good heed 
or I will make he hop without a head 
for his presumption dotard that he be 
in Cornwall he have make such mutiny 
first set of the king against the queen 
then stir up the commons against the king 
that have he there continue any long 
he have be call in question for his fact 
so upon that occasion thence he flee 
and come thus sly steal unto we 
and now already since his come hither 
my lord and he be grow in such a league 
that I can have no conference with his grace 
I fear he do already intimate 
some forge cavillation against my state 
it be therefore best to cut he off in time 
lest slanderous rumour once abroad disperse 
it be too late for they to be reverse 
friend as the tenor of these letter show 
my sister put great confidence in thou 

she never yet commit trust to i 
but that I hope she find i always faithful 
so will I be to any friend of she 
that have occasion to employ my help 

have thou the heart to act a stratagem 
and give a stab or two if need require 

I have a heart compact of adamant 
which never know what melt pity mean 
I weigh no more the murder of a man 
than I respect the crack of a flea 
when I do catch she bite on my skin 
if you will have your husband or your father 
or both of they send to another world 
do but command i do it it shall be do 

it be enough we make no doubt of thou 
meet we tomorrow here at nine o'clock 
meanwhile farewell and drink that for my sake 

ay this be it will make i do the deed 
o have I every day such customer 
this be the gainful trade in Christendom 
a purse of gold give for a paltry stab 
why here be a wench that long to have a stab 
well I can give it she and never hurt she neither 

when will these cloud of sorrow once disperse 
and smile joy triumph upon thy brow 
when will this scene of sadness have a end 
and pleasant act ensue to move delight 
when will my lovely queen cease to lament 
and take some comfort to her grieve thought 
if of thyself thou deign to have no care 
yet pity i who thy grief make despair 

o grieve not you my lord you have no cause 
let not my passion move your mind a whit 
for I be bind by nature to lament 
for his ill will that life to i first lend 
if so the stock be dry with disdain 
wither and sere the branch must needs remain 

but thou be now graft in another stock 
I be the stock and thou the lovely branch 
and from my root continual sap shall flow 
to make thou flourish with perpetual spring 
forget thy father and thy kindred now 
since they forsake thou like inhuman beast 
think they be dead since all their kindness die 
and bury they where black oblivion lie 
think not thou be the daughter of old Leir 
who do unkind disinherit thou 
but think thou be the noble gallian queen 
and wife to he that dear love thou 
embrace the joy that present with thou dwell 
let sorrow pack and hide herself in hell 

not that I miss my country or my kin 
my old acquaintance or my ancient friend 
do any whit distemperate my mind 
know you which be more dear to i 
than country kin and all thing else can be 
yet pardon i my gracious lord in this 
for what can stop the course of nature power 
as easy be it for fourfooted beast 
to stay themselves upon the liquid air 
and mount aloft into the element 
and overstrip the feather fowl in flight 
as easy be it for the slimy fish 
to live and thrive without the help of water 
as easy be it for the blackamoor 
to wash the tawny colour from his skin 
which all oppose against the course of nature 
as I be able to forget my father 

mirror of virtue phoenix of our age 
too kind a daughter for a unkind father 
be of good comfort for I will dispatch 
ambassador immediate for Britain 
unto the king of Cornwall court whereas 
your father keep now his residence 
and in the kind manner he entreat 
that set former grievance apart 
he will be please to come and visit we 
if no entreaty will suffice the turn 
I will offer he the half of all my crown 
if that move not we will furnish out a fleet 
and sail to Cornwall for to visit he 
and there you shall be firm reconcile 
in perfect love as erst you be before 

where tongue can sufficient thank afford 
the king of heaven remunerate my lord 

only be blithe and frolic sweet with i 
this and much more I will do to comfort thou 

it be a world to see now I be flush 
how many friend I purchase everywhere 
how many seek to creep into my favour 
and kiss their hand and bend their knee to i 
no more here come the queen now shall I know her mind 
and hope for to derive more crown from she 

my friend I see thou mind thy promise well 
and be before i here methinks today 

I be a poor man and it like your grace 
but yet I always love to keep my word 

well keep thy word with i and thou shall see 
that of a poor man I will make thou rich 

I long to hear it it may have be dispatch 
if you have tell i of it yesternight 

it be a thing of right strange consequence 
and well I can utter it in word 

it be more strange that I be not by this 
beside myself with long for to hear it 
be it to meet the devil in his den 
and try a bout with he for a scratch face 
I will undertake it if you will but bid i 

ah good my friend that I shall have thou do 
be such a thing as I do shame to speak 
yet it must needs be do 

I will speak it for thou queen shall I kill thy father 
I know it be that and if it be so say 

ay 

why that be enough 

and yet that be not all 

what else 

thou must kill that old man that come with he 

here be two hand for each of they be one 

and for each hand here be a recompense 

o that I have ten hand by miracle 
I can tear ten in piece with my tooth 
so in my mouth you will put a purse of gold 
but in what manner must it be effect 

tomorrow morning ere the break of day 
I by a wile will send they to the thicket 
that be about some two mile from the court 
and promise they to meet they there myself 
because I must have private conference 
about some news I have receive from Cornwall 
this be enough I know they will not fail 
and then be ready for to play thy part 
which do thou may right easy escape 
and no man once mistrust thou for the fact 
but yet before thou prosecute the act 
show he the letter which my sister send 
there let he read his own indictment first 
and then proceed to exertion 
but see thou faint not for they will speak fair 

can he speak word as please as the pipe 
of Mercury which charm the hundred eye 
of watchful Argos and inforce he sleep 
yet here be word so please to my thought 
as quite shall take away the sound of he 

about it then and when thou have dispatch 
I will find a mean to send thou after he 

I wonder that the messenger do stay 
who we dispatch for Cambria so long since 
if that his answer do not please we well 
and be do show good reason for delay 
I will teach he how to dally with his king 
and to detain we in such long suspense 

my lord I think the reason may be this 
my father mean to come along with he 
and therefore it be his pleasure he shall stay 
for to attend upon he on the way 

it may be so and therefore till I know 
the truth thereof I will suspend my judgement 

an it like your grace there be a ambassador 
arrive from Gallia and crave admittance to your majesty 

from Gallia what shall his message 
hither import be not your father happy 
go thither well whatsoever it be 
bid he come in he shall have audience 
what news from Gallia speak ambassador 

the noble king and queen of Gallia first salute 
by i their honourable father my lord Leir 
next they commend they kind to your grace 
as those who welfare they entire wish 
letter I have to deliver to my lord Leir 
and present too if I may speak with he 

if you may speak with he why do you think 
we be afraid that you shall speak with he 

pardon i madam for I think not so 
but say so only because he be not here 

Indeed my friend upon some urgent cause 
he be at this time absent from the court 
but if a day or two you here repose 
it be very likely you shall have he here 
or else have certain notice where he be 

be not we worthy to receive your message 

I have in charge to do it to himself 

it may be then it will not be do in haste 
how do my sister brook the air of France 

exceed well and never sick one hour 
since first she set her foot upon the shore 

I be the more sorry 

I hope not so madam 

do thou not say that she be ever sick 
since the first hour that she arrive there 

no madam I say quite contrary 

then I mistake thou 

then she be merry if she have her health 

o no her grief exceed until the time 
that she be reconcile unto her father 

God continue it 

what madam 

why her health 

amen to that but God release her grief 
and send her father in a better mind 
than to continue always so unkind 

I will be a mediator in her cause 
and seek all mean to expiate his wrath 

madam I hope your grace will do the like 

shall I be a mean to exasperate his wrath 
against my sister who I love so dear no no 

to expiate or mitigate his wrath 
for he have misconceive without a cause 

o ay what else 

it be pity it shall be so will it be other wise 

it be great pity it shall be otherwise 

then how madam 

then that they shall be reconcile again 

it show you bear a honourable mind 

it show thy understanding to be blind 
and that thou have need of a interpreter 
well I will know thy message ere it be long 
and find a mean to cross it if I can 

Come in my friend and frolic in our court 
till certain notice of my father come 

my lord you be up today before your hour 
it be news to you to be abroad so rathe 

it be news indeed I be so extreme heavy 
that I can scarce keep my eyelid open 

and so be I but I impute the cause 
to rise soon then we use to do 

hither my daughter mean to come disguise 
I will sit i down and read until she come 

she will not be long I warrant you my lord 
but say a couple of these they call good fellow 
shall step out of a hedge and set upon we 
we be in good case for to answer they 

it be not for we to stand upon our hand 

I fear we scant shall stand upon our leg 
but how shall we do to defend ourselves 

Even pray to God to bless we from their hand 
for fervent prayer much ill hap withstand 

I will sit and pray with you for company 
yet be I never so heavy in my life 

be it not a mad jest lest two or three of my profession shall meet i and lay i down in a ditch and play rob thief with i and perforce take my gold away from i while I act this stratagem and by this mean the grey beard shall escape faith when I be at liberty again I will make no more to do but go to the next tree and there hang myself 
but stay methinks my youth be here already 
and with pure zeal have pray themselves asleep 
I think they know to what intent they come 
and be provide for another world 
now can I stab they brave while they sleep 
and in a manner put they to no pain 
and do so I show they mighty friendship 
for fear of death be worse than death itself 
but that my sweet queen will i for to show 
this letter to they ere I do the deed 
mass they begin to stir I will stand aside 
so shall I come upon they unaware 

I marvel that my daughter stay so long 

I fear we do mistake the place my lord 

God grant we do not miscarry in the place 
I have a short nap but so full of dread 
as much amaze i to think thereof 

fear not my lord dream be but fantasy 
and slight imagination of the brain 

persuade he so but I will make he and you 
confess that dream do often prove too true 

I pray my lord what be the effect of it 
I may go near to guess what it pretend 

leave that to i I will expound the dream 

methinks my daughter Goneril and Ragan 
stand both before i with such grim aspect 
each brandish a falchion in their hand 
ready to lop a limb off where it fall 
and in their other hand a naked poniard 
wherewith they stab i in a hundred place 
and to their think leave i there for dead 
but then my young daughter fair Cordelia 
come with a box of balsam in her hand 
and pour it into my bleed wound 
by who good mean I be recover well 
in perfect health as erst I be before 
and with the fear of this I do awake 
and yet for fear my feeble joint quake 

I will make you quake for something present 
stand stand 

we do my friend although with much ado 

deliver deliver 

deliver we good lord from such as he 

you shall have pray before while it be time 
and then perhaps you may have escape my hand 
but you like faithful watchman fall asleep 
the while I come and take your halberd from you 
and now you want your weapon of defence 
how have you any hope to be deliver 
This come because you have no better stay 
but fall asleep when you shall watch and pray

but unto God who my injustice see 
if it be so that she do seek revenge 
as with good reason she may just do 
I will most willing resign my life 
a sacrifice to mitigate her ire

because I be unworthy for to live 
therefore speak soon and I will soon make speed 
whether Cordelia will thou do this deed 

as I be a perfect gentleman thou speak French to i 
I never hear Cordelia name before 
nor never be in France in all my life 
I never know thou have a daughter there

but thy own tongue declare that thou have be 
a vile old wretch and full of heinous sin 

ah no my friend thou be deceive much 
for she except who I confess I wrong 
through dote frenzy and overjealous love 
there live not any under heaven bright eye 
that can convict i of impiety 
and therefore sure thou do mistake the mark 
for I be in true peace with all the world 

you be the fit for the king of heaven 
and therefore for to rid thou of suspense 
know thou the queen of Cambria and Cornwall 
thy own two daughter Goneril and Ragan 
appoint i to massacre thou here 
why will thou then persuade i that thou be 
in charity with all the world but now 
when thy own issue hold thou in such hate 
that they have hire i to abridge thy fate 
o fie upon such vile dissemble breath 
that will deceive even at the point of death 

be I awake or be it but a dream

and thou shall never wake until doom day 
by they I hope thou will have sleep enough 

yet gentle friend grant one thing ere I die 

I will grant you any thing except your life 

o but assure i by some certain token 
that my two daughter hire thou to this deed 
if I be once resolve of that than I 
will wish no long life but crave to die 

that to be true in sight of heaven I swear 

swear not by heaven for fear of punishment 
the heaven be guiltless of such heinous act 

I swear by earth the mother of we all 

swear not by earth for she abhor to bear 
such bastard as be murderer of her son 

why then by hell and all the devil I swear 

swear not by hell for that stand gape wide 
to swallow thou and if thou do this deed 

I will that word be in his belly again 
it have fright i even to the very heart 
this old man be some strong magician 
his word have turn my mind from this exploit 
then neither heaven earth nor hell be witness 
but let this paper witness for they all 
shall I relent or shall I prosecute 
shall I resolve or be I best recant 
I will not crack my credit with two queen 
to who I have already pass my word 
o but my conscience for this act do tell 
I get heaven hate earth scorn and pain of hell 

o just jehova who almighty power 
do govern all thing in this spacious world 
how can thou suffer such outrageous act 
to be commit without just revenge 
o viperous generation and accurse 
to seek his blood who blood do make they first

thing past all sense let we not seek to know 
it be god will and therefore must be so

be that thou go unto my daughter Cordelia 
and carry she her father late blessing 
withal desire she that she will forgive i 
for I have wrong she without any cause 
now lord receive i for I come to thou 
and die I hope in perfect charity 
dispatch I pray thou I have live too long 

ay but you be unwise to send a errand 
by he that never mean to deliver it 
why he must go along with you to heaven 
it be not good you shall go all alone 

no doubt he shall when by the course of nature 
he must surrender up his due to death 
but that time shall not come till God permit 

nay present to bear you company 
I have a passport for he in my pocket 
already seal and he must needs ride post

and I be pay for he as well as you

most willing will bear a share in death 
it skill not for i my friend a whit 
nor for a hundred such as thou and I 

marry but it do sir by your leave your good day be past though it be no matter for you it be a matter for i proper man be not so rife

I bring he forth whereas he have not be 
but for good will to bear i company 
he leave his friend his country and his good

o if he shall miscarry here and die 
who be the cause of it but only I 

why that be I let that never trouble thou 

o no it be I oh have I now to give thou 
the monarchy of all the spacious world 
to save his life I will bestow it on thou 
but I have nothing but these tear and prayer 
and the submission of a bend knee kneel 
o if all this to mercy move they mind 
spare he in heaven thou shall like mercy find 

I be as hard to be move as another and yet methinks the strength of their persuasion stir i a little 

my friend if fear of the almighty power 
have power to move thou we have say enough 
but if thy mind be movable with gold 
we have not present to give it thou 
yet to thyself thou may do great good 
to keep thy hand still undefiled from blood 
for do but well consider with thyself 
when thou have finish this outrageous act 
what horror still will haunt thou for the deed 
think this again that they which will incense 
thou for to be the butcher of their father 
when it be do for fear it shall be know 
will make a mean to rid thou from the world 
o then be thou for ever tie in chain 
of everlasting torment to endure 
even in the hot hole of grisly hell 
such pain as never mortal tongue can tell 

o heaven be thank he will spare my friend

it be not good to return from whence we come 
unto your daughter Ragan back again 
now let we go to France unto Cordelia 
your young daughter doubtless she will succour you 

o how can I persuade myself of that 
since the other two be quite devoid of love 
to who I be so kind as that my gift 
may make they love i if it be nothing else 

no worldly gift but grace from God on high 
do nourish virtue and true charity 
Remember well what word Cordelia speak 
what time you ask she how she love your grace 
she say her love unto you be as much 
as ought a child to bear unto her father 

but she do find my love be not to she 
as shall a father bear unto a child 

that make not her love to be any less 
if she do love you as a child shall do 
you have try two try one more for my sake 
I will never entreat you further trial make 
Remember well the dream you have of late 
and think what comfort it foretell to we 

Come true friend that ever man possess 
I know thou counsel all thing for the best 
if this three daughter play a kind part 
it come of God and not of my desert 

there be of late news come unto the court 
that old lord Leir remain in Cambria 
I will hie i thither present to impart 
my letter and my message unto he 
I never be less welcome to a place 
in all my life time than I have be hither 
especial unto the stately queen 
who will not cast one gracious look on i 
but still with lower and suspicious eye 
will take exception at each word I speak 
and fain she will have undermine i 
to know what my ambassage do import 
but she be like to hop without her hope 
and in this matter for to want her will 
though by report she will have it in all thing else 
well I will post away for Cambria 
within these few day I hope to be there 

by this our father understand our mind 
and our kind greeting send to he of late 
therefore my mind presage ere it be long 
we shall receive from Britain happy news

for she to i have always be unkind 

fear not my love since that we know the worst

if he will not come to Gallia unto we 
than we will sail to Britain unto he

I have swear I will never come home without my wench 
and I will not be forswear 
I will rather never come home while I live

I will have make she follow i to France 

nay you will have be so kind as take she with you 
or else be I as she 
I will have be so love as I will stay behind you 
yet I must confess you be a very proper man 
and able to make a wench do more than she will do 

well I have a pair of slop for the nonce 
will hold all your mock 

nay we see you have a handsome hose 

ay and of the new fashion 

more bob more put they in still they will serve instead of bombast yet put not in too many lest the seam crack and they fly out among you again you must not think to outface i so easy in my mistress quarrel who if I see once again ten team of horse shall not draw i away till I have full and whole possession 

ay but one team and a cart will serve the turn 

not only for he but also for his wench 

well you be two to one I will give you over 
and since I see you so pleasant dispose 
which indeed be but seldom see I will claim 
a promise of you which you shall not deny i 
for promise be debt and by this hand you promise it i 
therefore you owe it i and you shall pay it i 
or I will sue you upon a action of unkindness 

prithee lord Mumford what promise do I make thou 

faith nothing but this 
that the next fair weather which be very now 
you will go in progress down to the sea side 
which be very near 

faith in this motion I will join with thou 
and be a mediator to my queen 
prithee my love let this march go forward 
my mind foretell it will be a lucky voyage 

entreaty need not where you may command 
so you be please I be right well content 
yet as the sea I much desire to see 
so be I most unwilling to be see 

we will go disguise all unknown to any 

howsoever you make one I will make another 

and I the three o I be overjoy 
see what love be which get with a word 
what all the world beside can never obtain 
but what disguise shall we have my lord 

Fayth thus my queen and I will be disguise 
like a plain country couple and you shall be Roger 
our man and wait upon we or if you will 
you shall go first and we will wait on you 

it be more than time this device be excellent 
Come le we about it 

what strange mischance or unexpected hap 
have thus deprive we of our father presence 
can no man tell we what be become of he 
with who we do converse not two day since 
my lord let everywhere lighthorse be send 
to scour about through all our regiment 
Dispatch a post immediate to Cornwall 
to see if any news by of he there 
myself will make a strict inquiry here 
and all about our city near at hand 
till certain news of his abode be bring 

all sorrow be but counterfeit to i 
who lip be almost seal up with grief 
my be the substance while they do but seem 
to weep the less which tear can redeem 
oh never be hear so strange a misadventure 
a thing so far beyond the reach of sense 
since no man reason in the cause can enter 
what have remove my father thus from hence 
o I do fear some charm or invocation 
of wicked spirit or infernal fiend 
stir by Cordelia move this innovation 
and bring my father timeless to his end 
but may I know that the detest witch 
be certain cause of this uncertain ill 
myself to France will go in some disguise 
and with these nail scratch out her hateful eye 
for since I be deprive of my father 
I loathe my life and wish my death the rather 

the heaven be just and hate impiety 
and will no doubt reveal such heinous crime 
censure not any till you know the right 
let he be judge that bring truth to light 

o but my grief like to a swell tide 
exceed the bound of common patience 
nor can I moderate my tongue so much 
to conceal they who I hold in suspect 

this matter shall be sift if it be she 
a thousand France shall not harbour she 

all happiness unto the cambrian king 

welcome my friend from whence be thy ambassage 

I come from Gallia unto Cornwall send 
with letter to your honourable father 
who there not find as I do expect 
I be direct hither to repair 

Frenchman what be thy message to my father 

my letter madam will import the same 
which my commission be for to deliver 

in his absence you may trust we with your letter 

I must perform my charge in such a manner 
as I have strict commandment from the king 

there be good pack betwixt your king and you 
you need not hither come to ask for he 
you know where he be better than ourselves 

madam I hope not far off 

have the young murderess your outrageous queen 
no mean to colour her detest deed 
in finish my guiltless father day 
because he give she nothing to her dowry 
but by the colour of a feign ambassage 
to send he letter hither to our court 
go carry they to they that send they hither 
and bid they keep their scroll unto themselves 
they can blind we with such slight excuse 
to smother up so monstrous vild abuse 
and be it not it be against law of arm 
to offer violence to a messenger 
we will inflict such torment on thyself 
as shall enforce thou to reveal the truth 

madam your threat no whit appall my mind 
I know my conscience guiltless of this act 
my king and queen I dare be swear be free 
from any thought of such impiety 
and therefore madam you have do they wrong 
and ill beseem with a sister love 
who in mere duty tender he as much 
as ever you respect he for dowry 
the king your husband will not say as much 

I will suspend my judgement for a time 
till more appearance give we further light 
yet to be plain your come do enforce 
a great suspicion to our doubtful mind 
and that you do resemble to be brief 
he that first rob and then cry stop the thief 

pray God some near you have not do the like 

hence saucy mate reply no more to we 
for law of arm shall not protect thy tongue 

never be I offer such discourtesy 
God and my king I trust ere it be long 
will find a mean to remedy this wrong 

how shall I live to suffer this disgrace 
at every base and vulgar peasant hand 
it ill befit my imperial state 
to be thus use and no man take my part 

what shall I do infringe the law of arm 
be to my everlasting obloquy 
but I will take revenge upon his master 
which send he hither to delude we thus 

nay if you put up this be sure ere long 
now that my father thus be make away 
she will come and claim a three part of your crown 
as due unto she by inheritance 

but I will prove her title to be nought 
but shame and the reward of parricide 
and make she a example to the world 
for afterage to admire her penance 
this will I do as I be Cambria king 
or lose my life to prosecute revenge 
Come first let we learn what news be of our father 
and then proceed as best occasion fit 

my honest friend we be ashamed to show 
the great extremity of our present state 
in that at this time we be bring so low 
that we want money for to pay our passage 
the truth be so we meet with some good fellow 
a little before we come aboard your ship 
which strip we quite of all the coin we have 
and leave we not a penny in our purse 
yet want money we will use the mean 
to see you satisfy to the uttermost 

here be a good gown it will become i pass well 
I shall be fine in it

faith have we other to supply their room 
though never so mean you willing shall have they 

do you hear sir you look like a honest man 
I will not stand to do you a pleasure here be a good strong motley gaberdine cost i fourteen good shilling at Billingsgate give i your gown for it and your cap for i and I will forgive your passage 

with all my heart and xx thank 

do you hear sir you shall have a better match than he because you be my friend here be a good sheep russet seagown will bide more stress I warrant you than two of he yet for you seem to be a honest gentleman I be content to change it for your cloak and ask you nothing for your passage more 

my own I willing will change with thou 
and think myself indebt to thy kindness 
but will my friend may keep his garment still 
my friend I will give thou this new doublet if thou will 
restore his gown unto he back again 

nay if I do will I may never eat powder beef and mustard more nor drink can of good liquor while I live my friend you have small reason to seek to hinder i of my bargain but the best be a bargain be a bargain 

kind friend it be much better as it be 
for by this mean we may escape unknown 
till time and opportunity do fit 

hark hark they be lay their head together 
they will repent they of their bargain anon 
it be best for we to go while we be well 

God be with you sir for your passage back again 
I will use you as unreasonable as another 

I know thou will but we hope to bring ready money 
with we when we come back again 
Were ever man in this extremity 
in a strange country and devoid of friend 
and not a penny for to help ourselves 
kind friend what think thou will become of we 

be of good cheer my lord I have a doublet 
will yield we money enough to serve our turn 
until we come unto your daughter court 
and then I hope we shall find friend enough 

ah kind Perillus that be it I fear 
and make i faint or ever I come there 
can kindness spring out of ingratitude 
or love be reap where hatred have be sow 
can henbane join in league with mithridate 
or sugar grow in wormwood bitter stalk 
it can be they be too opposite 
and so be I to any kindness here 
I have throw wormwood on the sugar youth 
and like to henbane poison the fount 
whence flow the mithridate of a child goodwill 
ay like a envious thorn have prick the heart 
and turn sweet grape to sour unrelished sloe 
the causelesseire of my respectless breast 
have sour the sweet milk of dame nature pap 
my bitter word have gall her honey thought 
and weed of rancour choke the flower of grace 
then what remainder be of any hope 
but all our fortune will go quite aslope 

fear not my lord the perfect good indeed 
can never be corrupt by the bad 
a new fresh vessel still retain the taste 
of that which first be pour into the same 
and therefore though you name yourself the thorn 
the weed the gall the henbane and the wormwood 
yet she will continue in her former state 
the honey milk grape sugar mithridate 

thou please orator unto i in woe 
cease to beguile i with thy hopeful speech 
oh join with i and think of nought but cross 
and then we will one lament another loss 

why say the worst the worst can be but death 
and death be better than for to despair 
then hazard death which may convert to life 
banish despair which bring a thousand death 

overcome with thy strong argument I yield 
to be direct by thou as thou will 
as thou yield comfort to my craze thought 
will I can yield the like unto thy body 
which be full weak I know and ill pay 
for want of fresh meat and due sustenance 

alack my lord my heart do bleed to think 
that you shall be in such extremity 

Come let we go and see what God will send 
when all mean fail he be the sure friend 

this tedious journey all on foot sweet love 
can be please to your tender joint 
which never be use to these toilsome walk 

I never in my life take more delight 
in any journey than I do in this 
i do i good whenas we happen to light 
among the merry crew of country folk 
to see what industry and pain they take 
to win they commendation among their friend 
lord how they labour to bestir themselves 
and in their quirk to go beyond the moon 
and so take on they with such antic fit 
that one will think they be beside their wit 
Come away Roger with your basket 

soft dame here come a couple of old youth 
I must needs make myself fat with test at they 

nay prithee do not they do seem to be 
man much overgo with grief and misery 
let we stand aside and harken what they say 

ah my Perillus now I see we both 
shall end our day in this untrustful soil 
o I do faint for want of sustenance 
and thou I know in little better case 
no gentle tree afford one taste of fruit 
to comfort we until we meet with man 
no lucky path conduct our luckless step 
unto a place where any comfort dwell 
sweet rest betide unto our happy soul 
for here I see our body must have end 

ah my dear lord how do my heart lament 
to see you bring to this extremity 
o if you love i as you do profess 
or ever think well of i in my life 
feed on this flesh who vein be not so dry 
but there be virtue leave to comfort you 
oh feed on this if this will do you good 
I will smile for joy to see you suck my blood 

I be no cannibal that I shall delight 
to slake my hungry jaw with humane flesh 
I be no devil or ten time worse than so 
to suck the blood of such a peerless friend 
o do not think that I respect my life 
so dear as I do thy loyal love 
ah Britain I shall never see thou more 
that have unkind banish thy king 
and yet not thou do make i to complain 
but they which be more near to i than thou

ah Goneril be half my kingdom gift 
the cause that thou do seek to have my life 
ah cruel Ragan do I give thou all 
and all can not suffice without my blood 
ah poor Cordelia do I give thou nought 
nor never shall be able for to give 
o let i warn all age that ensue 
how they trust flattery and reject the truth 
well unkind girl I here forgive you both 
yet the just heaven will hardly do the like 
and only crave forgiveness at the end 
of good Cordelia and of thou my friend 
of God who majesty I have offend 
by my transgression many thousand way 
of she dear heart who I for no occasion 
turn out of all through flatterer persuasion 
of thou kind friend who but for i I know 
have never come unto this place of woe 

alack that ever I shall live to see 
my noble father in this misery 

sweet love reveal not what thou be as yet 
until we know the ground of all this 

o but some meat some meat do you not see 
how near they be to death for want of food 

lord which do help they servant at their need 
or now or never send we help with speed 
o comfort comfort yonder be a banquet 
and man and woman my lord be of good cheer 
for I see comfort come very near 
o my lord a banquet and man and woman 

o let kind pity mollify their heart 
that they may help we in our great extreme 

God save you friend and if this bless banquet

even for his sake that save we all from death 
vouchsafe to save we from the gripe of famine 

here father sit and eat here sit and drink 
and will it be far better for your sake 

I will give you thank anon my friend do faint 
and need present comfort 

I warrant he never stay to say grace 
oh there be no sauce to a good stomach 

the bless god of heaven have think upon we 

the thank be he and these kind courteous folk 
by who humanity we be preserve 

and may that draught be unto he as be 
that which old Aeson drink which do renew 
his wither age and make he young again 
and may that meat be unto he as be 
that which Elias eat in strength whereof 
he walk forty day and never faint 
shall I conceal i long from my father 
or shall I manifest myself to he 

forbear a while until his strength return 
lest be overjoy with see thou 
his poor weak sense shall forsake their office 
and so our cause of joy be turn to sorrow 

what cheer my lord how do you feel yourself 

methinks I never eat such savoury meat 
it be as pleasant as the bless manna 
that rain from heaven among the Israelite 
it have recall my spirit home again 
and make i fresh as erst I be before 
but how shall we congratulate their kindness 

i'faith I know no how sufficient 
but the best mean that I can think on be this 
I will offer they my doublet in requital 
for we have nothing else to spare 

nay stay Perillus for they shall have i 

pardon my lord I swear they shall have i 

ah who will think such kindness shall remain 
among such strange and unacquainted man 
and that such hate shall harbour in the breast 
of those which have occasion to be best 

ah good old father tell to i thy grief 
I will sorrow with thou if not add relief 

ah good young daughter I may call thou so 
for thou be like a daughter I do owe 

do you not owe she still what be she dead 

no God forbid but all my interest be go 
by show myself too much unnatural 
so have I lose the title of a father 
and i be call a stranger to she rather 

your title be good still for it be always know 
a man may do as he list with his own 
but have you but one daughter then in all 

yes I have more by two then will I have 

o say not so but rather see the end 
they that be bad may have the grace to mend 
but how have they offend you so much 

if from the first I shall relate the cause 
it will make a heart of adamant to weep 
and thou poor soul kindhearted as thou be 
do weep already ere I do begin 

for god love tell it and when you have do 
I will tell the reason why I weep so soon 

the know this first I be a Britain bear 
and have three daughter by one love wife 
and though I say it of beauty they be speed 
especial the young of the three 
for her perfection hardly match can be 
on these I dote with a jealous love 
and think to try which of they love i best 
by ask they which will do most for i 
the first and second flatter i with word 
and vow they love i better than their life 
the young say she love i as a child 
may do her answer I esteem most vild 
and present in a outrageous mood 
I turn she from i to go sink or swim 
and all I have even to the very clothes 
I give in dowry with the other two 
and she that best deserve the great share 
I give she nothing but disgrace and care 
now mark the sequel when I have do thus 
I sojourn in my elder daughter house 
where for a time I be entreat well 
and live in state suffice my content 
but every day her kindness do grow cold 
which I with patience put up well enough 
and seem not to see the thing I see 
but at the last she grow so far incense 
with moody fury and with causeless hate 
that in most vild and contumelious term 
she bid i pack and harbour somewhere else 
then be I fain for refuge to repair 
unto my other daughter for relief 
who give i please and most courteous word 
but in her action show herself so sore 
as never any daughter do before 
she pray i in a morning out betimes 
to go to a thicket two mile from the court 
point that there she will come talk with i 
there she have set a shaghaired murder wretch 
to massacre my honest friend and i 
then judge yourself although my tale be brief 
if ever man have great cause of grief 

nor never like impiety be do 
since the creation of the world begin 

and now I be constrain to seek relief 
of she to who I have be so unkind 
who censure if it do award i death 
I must confess she pay i but my due 
but if she show a love daughter part 
it come of God and she not my desert 

no doubt she will I dare be swear she will 

How know you that not know what she be 

myself a father have a great way hence 
use i as ill as ever you do her 
yet that his reverend age I once may see 
I will creep along to meet he on my knee 

o no man child be unkind but i 

condemn not all because of other crime 
but look dear father look behold and see 
thy love daughter speak unto thou 

o stand thou up it be my part to kneel 
and ask forgiveness for my former fault 

o if you wish I shall enjoy my breath 
dear father rise or I receive my death 

then I will rise to satisfy your mind 
but kneel again till pardon be resign 

I pardon you the word beseem not i 
but I do say so for to ease your knee 
you give i life you be the cause that I 
be what I be who else have never be 

but you give life to i and to my friend 
who day have else have a untimely end 

you bring i up whenas I be but young 
and far unable for to help myself 

I cast thou forth whenas thou be but young 
and far unable for to help thyself 

God world and nature say I do you wrong 
that can endure to see you kneel so long 

let i break off this love controversy 
which do rejoice my very soul to see 
good father rise she be your love daughter 
and honour you with as respective duty 
as if you be the monarch of the world 

but I will never rise from off my knee 
until I have your blessing and your pardon 
of all my fault commit any way 
from my first birth unto this present day 

the blessing which the god of Abraham give 
unto the tribe of juda light on thou 
and multiply thy day that thou may see 
thy child child prosper after thou 
thy fault which be just none that I do know 
God pardon on high and I forgive below 

now be my heart at quiet and do leap 
within my breast for joy of this good hap 
and now dear father welcome to our court 
and welcome kind Perillus unto i 
mirror of virtue and true honesty 

o he have be the kind friend to i 
that ever man have in adversity 

my tongue do fail to say what heart do think 
I be so ravish with exceed joy 

all you have speak now let i speak my mind 
and in few word much matter here conclude 
if ere my heart do harbour any joy 
or true content repose within my breast 
till I have root out this viperous sect 
and repossess my father of his crown 
let i be count for the perjure man 
that ever speak word since the world begin 

let i pray to that never pray before 
if ere I resalute the british earth 
as ere it be long I do presume I shall 
and do return from thence without my wench 
let i be geld for my recompense 

Come let we to arm for to redress this wrong 
till I be there methinks the time seem long 

I feel a hell of conscience in my breast 
torment i with horror for my fact 
and make i in a agony of doubt 
for fear the world shall find my deal out 
the slave who I appoint for the act 
I never set eye upon the peasant since 
oh can I get he for to make he sure 
my doubt will cease and I shall rest secure 
but if the old man with persuasive word 
have save their life and make he to relent 
then be they flee unto the court of France 
and like a trumpet manifest my shame 
a shame on these whitelivered slave say I 
that with fair word so soon be overcome 
o God that I have be but make a man 
or that my strength be equal with my will 
these foolish man be nothing but mere pity 
and melt as butter do against the sun 
why shall they have preeminence over we 
since we be creature of more brave resolve 
I swear I be quite out of charity 
with all the heartless man in Christendom 
a pox upon they when they be afraid 
to give a stab or slit a paltry windpipe 
which be so easy matter to be do 
well have I think the slave will serve i so 
myself will have be executioner 
it be now undo and if that it be know 
I will make as good shift as I can for one 
he that repine at i however it stand 
it be best for he to keep he from my hand 

thus have we bring our army to the sea 
whereas our ship be ready to receive we 
the wind stand fair and we in four hour sail 
may easy arrive on british shore 
where unexpected we may they surprise 
and gain a glorious victory with ease 
wherefore my love countryman resolve 
since truth and justice fight on our side 
that we shall march with conquest where we go 
myself will be as forward as the first 
and step by step march with the hardy wight 
and not the mean soldier in our camp 
shall be in danger but I will second he 
to you my lord we give the whole command 
of all the army next unto ourself 
not doubt of you but you will extend 
your wont valour in this needful case 
encourage the rest to do the like 
by your approve magnanimity 

my liege it be needless to spur a willing horse 
that be apt enough to run himself to death 
for here I swear by that sweet saint bright eye 
which be the star which guide i to good hap 
either to see my old lord crown anew 
or in his cause to bid the world adieu 

thank good lord Mumford it be more of your good will 
than any merit or desert in i 

and now to you my worthy country man 
you valiant race of genovestan Gaul 
surname Redthanks for your chivalry 
because you fight up to the thank in blood 
show yourselves now to be right Gaul indeed 
and be so bitter on your enemy 
that they may say you be as bitter as gall 
gall they brave shot with your artillery 
gall they brave halberd with your sharp point bill 
each in their point place not one but all 
fight for the credit of yourselves and Gaul 

then what shall more persuasion need to those 
that rather wish to deal then hear of blow 
let we to our ship and it that God permit 
in four hour sail I hope we shall be there 

and in five hour more I make no doubt 
but we shall bring our wish desire about 

my honest friend it be your turn tonight 
to watch in this place near about the beacon 
and vigilant have regard 
if any fleet of ship past hitherward 
which it you do your office be to fire 
the beacon present and raise the town

faith neighbour and you will follow my advice instead of watch the beacon we will go to goodman Gennings and watch a pot of ale and a rasher of bacon and if we do not drink ourselves drink then so I warrant the beacon will see we when we come out again 

ay but how if somebody excuse we to the captain

now march our ensign on the british earth 
and we be near approach to the town 
then look about you valiant countryman 
and we shall finish this exploit with ease 
the inhabitant of this mistrustful place 
be dead asleep as man that be secure 
here shall we skirmish but with naked man 
devoid of sense new wake from a dream 
that know not what our come do pretend 
till they do feel our meaning on their skin 
therefore assail God and our right for we 

where be these villain that be set to watch 
and fire the beacon if occasion serve 
that thus have suffer we to be surprise 
and never give notice to the town 
we be betray and quite devoid of hope 
by any mean to fortify ourselves 

it be ten to one the peasant be overcome with drink and sleep and so neglect their charge 

a whirlwind carry they quick to a whirlpool that there the slave may drink their belly full 

this it be to have the beacon so near the alehouse 

out on you villain whither run you now 

to fire the town and call up the beacon

that victory may prosecute the right

and add fresh vigour to my willing limb 
but hark I hear the adverse drum approach

presumptuous king of Gaul how dare thou 
presume to enter on our british shore 
and more than that to take our town perforce 
and draw our subject heart from their true king

as ere you buy presumption in your life 

overdare Cornwall know we come in right 
and just revengement of the wrong king 
who daughter there fall viper as they be 
have seek to murder and deprive of life 
but God protect he from all their spite 
and we be come in justice of his right

except for fear of our revenge hand 
thou fly to sea as not secure on land 

Welshman I will so ferret you ere night for that word 
that you shall have no mind to crake so well this twelvemonth 

they lie that say we seek our father death
