sir you be the very friend I wish to meet with 
I have a large discourse invite your ear 
to be a auditor 

and what concern it 

the sad thrive progress of the love 
between my lord the prince and that great lady 
who insolence and neveryetmatched pride 
can by no character be well express 
but in she only name the prow Erota 

Alas Melitus I shall guess the best 
success your prince can find from she to be 
as harsh as the event do prove but now 
it be not a time to pity passionate grief 
when a whole kingdom in a manner lie 
upon its deathbed bleed 

who can tell 
whether or no these many plague at once 
hang over this unhappy land for her sake 
that be a monster in it 

here be the misery 
of have a child our prince else I presume 
the bold venetian have not dare to attempt 
so bloody a invasion 

yet I wonder 
why master secretary still the senate 
so almost superstitious adore 
Gonzalo the venetian lord consider 
the outrage of his countryman 

the senate 
be wise and therein just for this Gonzalo 
upon a massacre perform at sea 
by the admiral of Venice on a merchant 
of Candy when the cause be to be hear 
before the senate there in open court 
profess that the cruelty the admiral 
have show deserve not only fine but death 
for Candy then and Venice be at peace 
since when upon a motion in the senate 
for conquest of our land it be know for certain 
that only this Gonzalo dare to oppose it 
his reason be because it too much savour 
of lawless and unjust ambition 
the war be scarce begin but he in fear 
of quarrel against his life flee from his country 
and hither come where to confirm his truth 
I know Melitus he out of his own store 
have money Cassilanes the general 

what without other pledge than cassilane 
bare promise of payment 

no it may be 
he have some petty lordship to retire to 
but this he have do now it be fit Melitus 
the senate shall be thankful otherwise 
they shall annihilate one of those law 
for which this kingdom be throughout the world 
unfollowed and admire 

what law be these sir 
let i so much importune you 

you shall 
and they be worth your knowledge brief thus 
who ere he be that can detect apparent 
another of ingratitude for any 
receive benefit the plaintiff may 
require the offender life unless he please 
free and willing to grant remission 

by which strict law the senate be in danger 
shall they neglect Gonzalo 

right the law 
permit a like equality to alien 
as to a homeborn patriot 

pray sir the other 

know Melitus 
the elder cretan flourish many year 
in war in peace unparalleled and they 
to spur heroic spirit on to virtue 
enact that what man soever he be 
do noble in the field against his enemy 
so by the general voice approve and know 
may at his homereturn make his demand 
for satisfaction and reward 

they be 
both famous law indeed enter a messenger 

master secretary 
the senate be about to sit and crave 
your presence 

what so sudden 

these letter 
will show the cause why 

heaven thou be great 
and worthy to be thank 

your countenance sir 
do promise some good tiding 

o the best 
and happy for this land that ever be tell 
all the venetian force be defeat 

how sir 

and what do add some delight more 
there be among the soldier a contention 
who shall be the triumpher and it stand 
doubtful between a father and his son 
old cassilane and young Antinous 

why may not both demand it 

the law deny it 
but where the soldier do not all consent 
the party in contention be refer 
to plead before the senate and from they 
upon a open audience to be judge 
the chief and then to make demand 

you ravish i 
with wonder and delight 

Come as we walk 
I shall more full inform you exeunt 

admit no soldier near we till the senate 
have take their place 

you be obey my lord 

Decius fall off 

I shall 

Give leave Arcanes 
youngman come near to i who be I 

it be a sin against the piety 
of filial duty if I shall forget 
the debt I owe my father on my knee 
your pleasure 

what so low can thou find joint 
yet be a elephant Antinous rise 
thou will belie opinion and rebate 
the ambition of thy gallantry that they 
who confidence thou have bewitch shall see 
their little god of war kneel to his father 
though in my hand I do grasp thunder 

sir 
for proof that I acknowledge you the author 
of give i my birth I have discharge 
a part of my obedience but if now 
you shall as cruel father do proclaim 
your right and tyrant like usurp the glory 
of my peculiar honour not derive 
from successary but purchase with my blood 
than I must stand first champion for myself 
against all interposer 

bold urge 
and proud I can love thou do not anger 
consult with just disdain in open language 
to call thou most ungrateful Say free 
will thou resign the flattery whereon 
the reel pillar of a popular breath 
have raise thy giantlike conceit to add 
a suffrage to thy father merit speak 

sir hear i be there not a chronicle 
well pen by all their tongue who can report 
what they have see you do or have you not 
best in your own performance write yourself 
and be your own text I will undertake 
alone without the help of art or character 
but only to recount you deed in arm 
and you shall ever then be fame a precedent 
of live victory but as you be 
great and well worthy to be style great 
it will betray a poverty of spirit 
in i to obstruct my fortune or descent 
if I shall cowardlike surrender up 
the interest which the inheritance of your virtue 
and my own thrifty fate can claim in honour 
my lord of all the mass of fame which any 
that wear a sword and have but see i fight 
give i I will not share nor yield one jot 
one tittle 

not to i 

you be my father 
yet not to you 

ambitious boy how dare thou 
to tell i that thou will contend 

have I 
be slothful and not follow you in all 
the straits of death you may have just then 
repute i a bastard it be a cruelty 
more than to murder innocent to take 
the life of my yet infanthonour from i 

Antinous look upon this badge of age 
thy father grayhaired beard full fifty year 
and more than half of this ere thou be bear 
I have be know a soldier in which time 
I find no difference betwixt war and peace 
for war be peace to i and peace be war 
Antinous mark i well there have not live 
these fifty year a man who Crete prefer 
before thy far let i bold boast 
thy father both for discipline and action 
have so long be the first of all his nation 
now can thou think it honest charitable 
nay humane be so young my son my child 
beget breed teach by i by i thy father 
for one day service and that on thy first 
to rob i of a glory which I fight for 
a half of hundred year 

my case observe 
both equity and precedent for sir 
that very day whereon you get your fame 
you take it from some other who be then 
chief in repute as you be now and have be 
perhaps as many year deserve that 
which you gain in a day as I have i 

but he be not my father then Antinous 
thou leave out that 

sir have he be your father 
he have be then immortal for a father 
heighten his reputation where his son 
inherit it as when you give we life 
your life be not diminish but renew 
in we when you be dead and we be still 
your live image 

So be thou curse 
in thy posterity as I in thou 
dishonourable boy oh shall that sun 
which not a year yet since behold i mount 
upon a fiery steed wave my sword 
and teach this youngman to manage arm 
that be a raw fresh novice in the feat 
of chivalry shall that same sun be witness 
against this brat of his ingratitude 
who to eclipse the light of my renown 
can no way hope to get a noble name 
but by the tread on his father greatness 
thou will not yield enter Arcanes 

my life but not the prize 
my sword have purchase 

the senate 
my lord be here at hand and all the soldier 
begin to throng about they 

now Arcanes then 

what sir 

trifle will affront we that 
fine fight stripling 

let he have the shame on it 
please you withdraw on this side 

my great heart 
be never quail before 

my lord be confident 
let not your father daunt you 

Decius whether 
must I withdraw 

on this side see the soldier 
attend your pleasure courage sir the senate 

way for the senate 
my good lord I know not 
what tax of arrogance I may incur 
shall I presume though court by your favour 
to take a place among you I have rather

by force though mean yet more become place 
then run the hazard of a doubtful censure 

my lord your wisdom be both know and try 
we can rank you in a noble friendship 
than your great service to the state deserve 

wil it please you sit enter Fernando with soldier 

what here my lord Porphicio

my lord you be too modest 

it be no season to be troublesome 
else but I have do your lordship be observe 

be the demandant ready 

he be ready 

produce he then 

before this sacred presence 
ay by a general consent be make 
the soldier voice and to your gracious wisdom 
present as chief in arm his country champion 
Cassilanes 

most reverend lord you hear the lesser number 
of those who have be guardian to this country 
approve this champion I in all their name 
who fight for candy here present before you 
the mighty man in arm Antinous 
speak fellow soldier 

Antinous Antinous 

stand by all save the two competitor 

my lord how much your country owe you both 
the due reward of your desertful glory 
must to posterity remain but yet 
since by our law one only can make claim 
to the propose honour which you both 
it seem have true merit take leave 
free to plead your right we shall attend you 

wherein priority of voice be grant 
lord Cassilanes to you for that your rare 
and long experience in the course of war 
as well do challenge it as the best privilege 
of order and civility for that 
you be your brave opponent worthy father 
say countryman be you content 

ay I 

right grave right gracious father how unfit 
it be for i that all my life time have 
be practise in the school of blood and slaughter 
to bandy word now in my life last farewell 
your wisdom will consider be there pitch 
another and another field like that 
which not yet three day since this arm have scatter 
defeat and make nothing than the man 
that have a heart to think he can but follow 
for equal i he shall not through the lane 
of danger and amazement may in that 
that only of but follow i be happy 
repute worthy to be make my rival 
for it be not lord unknown to those about i 
my fellow soldier first with what a confidence 
I lead they on to fight go on still and 
And as if I can have be a second nature 
as well in hearten they by my example 
as by my exhortation I give life 
to quicken courage to inflame revenge 
to heighten resolution in a word 
to outdo action it boot not to discover 
how that youngman who be not fledge nor skill 
in martial play be even as ignorant 
as childish but I list not to disparage 
his non ability the signal give 
of battle when our enemy come on 
direct more by fury then warrant 
of policy and stratagem I meet they 
I in the forefront of the army meet they 
and as if this old weatherbeaten body 
have be compose of cannonproof I stand 
the volley of their shot ay I myself 
be he that first disrank their wood of pike 
but when we come to handystroke as often 
as I lend blow so often I give wound 
and every wound a death I may be bold 
to justify a truth this very sword 
of i slay more than any twain beside 
and which be not the least of all my glory 
when he this young man hand to hand in fight 
be by the general of the venetian 
and such as be his retinue unhorse 
I step between and rescue he myself 
or horse hoof have trample he to dirt 
and while he be remount I maintain 
the combat with the gallant general 
till have take breath he throng before i 
renew the fight and with a fatal blow 
steal both that honour from i and his life 
from he who I before myself alone 
have more than full three quarter kill a man 
well worthy only by this hand to have die 
not by a boy weak push I talk too much 
but it be a fault of age if to bring home 
long peace long victory even to your Capitol 
if to secure your kingdom wife and child 
your life and liberty if to renown 
your honour through the world to fix your name 
like blaze star admire and fear by all 
that have but hear of candy or a Cretan 
be to deserve the approvement of my manhood 
then thus much have I do what more examine 
the annal of my life and then consider 
what I have be and be lord I have say 

with reverence to the senate be it lawful 
without your custom breach to say a word 

Say on my lord Gonzalo 

I have hear 
and with no little wonder such high deed 
of chivalry discourse that I confess 
I do not think the worthy while they live 
all nine deserve as much applause or memory 
as this one but who can do aught to gain 
the crown of honour from he must be somewhat 
more than a man you tread a dangerous path 
yet I shall hear you glad for believe i 
thus much let i profess in honour cause 
I will not to my father nor my king 
my country father yield if you transcend 
what we have hear I can but only say 
that miracle be yet in use I fear 
I have offend 

you have speak noble 
Antinous use your privilege 

princely father 
ere I begin one suit I have to make 
it be just and honourable 

Poss speak and have it 

that you will please the soldier may all stand 
together by their general 

it be grant 
all fall to yonder side go on Antinous 

I shall be brief and plain all what my father 
this country patron have discourse be true 
fellow in arm speak you be it true 

true true 

it follow that the blaze of my performance 
take light from what I see he do and thus 
a city though the flame be much more dreadful 
may from a little spark be set on fire 
of all what I have do I shall give instance 
only in three main proof of my desert 
first I seek out but through how many danger 
my lord judge you the chief the great commander 
the head of that huge body who proud weight 
our land shrink under he I find and fight with 
fight with and slay fellow in arm speak you 
be it true or not 

true true 

when he be fall 
the heart of all our adversary 
begin to quail till young Fernando son 
to the last duke of Venice gather head 
and soon renew the field by who example 
the bold venetian double strength and courage 
have get the better of the day our man 
suppose that their adversary grow 
like Hydra head recoil and begin to sly 
I follow they and what I say they know 
the sum on it be I call they back new rank they 
lead on they follow shrink not till the end 
fellow in arm be it true or no 

true true 

last to finish all there be but one 
the only great exploit which be to take 
Fernando prisoner and that hand to hand 
in single fight I do myself without 
the help of any arm save the arm of heaven 
speak soldier be it true or no 

Antinous Antinous

strong apprehension of her beauty have 
make she believe that she be more than woman 
and as there do not want those flatterer 
about the world conqueror to make he think 
and do persuade he that he be a god 
so there be those base fly that will not stick 
to buzz into her ear she be a angel 
and that the food she feed on be ambrosia 

she shall not touch it then it be poet fare 

I may take leave to say she may as well 
determine of herself to be a goddess 
with lesser flattery than he a god 
for she do conquer more although not far 
every one look on her die in despair 
and will be glad to do it actual 
to have the next age tell how worthy 
and what good cause he have to perish so 
her beauty be superlative she know it 
and know it think no man can deserve 
but ought to perish and to die for she 
many great prince for her love have languish 
and give themselves a willing sacrifice 
proud to have end so and now there be 
a prince so mand in his own passion 
that he forget the royalty he be bear to

I must leave you then 
but my best wish shall remain with you

most pitiful prince 
who in the cauldron of affection 
look as he have be parboiled 

if I offend with too much love you 
it be a fault that I must still commit 
to make your mercy shine the more on i 

you be the selfsame creature you condemn 
or else you dare not follow i with hope 
that I can pity you who be so far 
from grant any comfort in this kind 
that you and all man else shall perish first 
I will live free and single till I find 
something above a man to equal i 
put all your brave hero into one 
your king and emperor and let he come 
in person of a man and I shall scorn he 
must and will scorn he 
the god of love himself have lose his eye 
his bow and torch extinguish and the poet 
that make he first a god have lose their fire 
since I appear and from my eye must steal it 
this I dare speak and let i see the man

Most come to see i and see i return

to make their story perfect for where the name 
mere the word of fair Erota stand

beget admiration in the man 
and in my own sex envy which glory be lose 
when I shall stick my beauty in a cloud 
and clear shine through it

which be thing I delight in 

Antinous follow i Exit 

she be vex to the soul 

let she be vex it be fit she shall be so 
give i thy hand Gonzalo thou be in our favour 
for we do love to cherish lofty spirit 
such as percusteere the earth and bind 
with a erect countenance to the cloud 

sfoot what thing be this 

I do love firework because they mount 
a exhalation I profess to adore 
beyond a fix star it be more illustrious 
as every thing raise out of smoke be so 
their virtue be in action what do you think of i 

troth sir 
you be beyond my guess I know you not 

do you know yourself 

yes sir 

why you and I be one I be proud and 
very proud too that I must tell you I see 
it do become you cousin Gonzalo prithee 
let it be so 

let it be so good cousin 

I be no great one fool 

I hope so for alliance sake 

yet I do serve the mighty monstrous and magnanimous 
invincible Erota 

o good cousin now I have you I will meet you in your coat 

coat I have my horseman coat I must confess 
line through with velvet and a scarlet outside 
if you will meet i in it I will send for it 
and cousin you shall see i with much comfort 
for it be both a new one and a right one 
it do not come collateral 

adieu good cousin at this present I have some business 

farewell excellent cousin 

candy I say be lose already 

yes 
if to be conqueror be to be lose 

you have it one day conquest have undo they 
and sell they to their vassalage for what 
have I else toil my brain profuse empty 
my money but to make they slave to Venice 
that so in case the sword do lose his edge 
than art may sharpen she 

Gonzalo how 

Fernando thus you see how through this land 
both of the best and base I be honour 
I only give the state of Venice notice 
when where and how to land or you have find 
a better entertainment I be he 
encourage young Antinous to affront 
the devil his father for the devil I think 
dare not do more in battle 

but why do you 
I find no such great policy in that 

Indeed Fernando thou can fight not plot 
have they continue one they two alone 
be of sufficient courage and performance 
to beat a army 

now by all my hope 
I rather shall admire than envy virtue 

why then by all your hope you will rather have 
your brain knock out then learn how to be wise 
you statesman well sir I do more than this 
when Cassilane crave from the common treasure 
pay for his soldier I strike home and lend he 
a hundred thousand ducat 

marry sir 
the policy be little the love less 
and honesty least of all 

How say you by that 
go fight I say go fight I will talk no more with you 
you be insensible 

well I shall observe you 

why look you sir by this mean have I get 
the great part of Cassilanes estate 
into my hand which he can never redeem 
but must of force sink do you conceive i now 

So 
but why have you importune the senate 
for i to sojourn with they 

there be the quintessence 
the soul and grand elixir of my wit 
for he accord to his noble nature 
will not be know to want though he do want 
and will be bankrupt so much the soon 
and make the subject of our scorn and laughter 

here be a perfect plot stratagem 

why can you 
imagine that I do not hate in heart 
my country enemy yes yes Fernando 
and I will be the man that shall undo they 

you be in a ready way 

I be never out on it 

peace 
here come a wise coxcomb a tame coward 
now worthy Gaspero what 
you come I know to be my lord Fernando 
conductor to old Cassilane 

to wait upon he 

and my lord the senator send you 

my noble lord they do 

my lord Fernando 
this gentleman as humble as you see he 
be even this kingdom treasure in a word 
it be his chief glory that he be not wise 
than honest nor more honest than approve 
in truth and faith 

my lord 

you may be bold 
to trust he with your bosom he will not deceive 
if you rely upon he once 

your name be Gaspero 

your servant 

go commend i 
right honest Gaspero commend i hearty 
to noble Cassilane tell he my love 
be vow to he 

I shall 

I know you will 
my lord I can long be absent from you 

sir you be now my guide Exit 

thus my design 
run uncontrolled yet Venice though I be 
intelligencer to thou in my brain 
be other large project for if proud Erota 
bend to my lure I will be candy king 
and duke of Venice too ha Venice too 
o it be pretty shove in why not Erota 
may in her love seal all sure if she swallow 
the bait I be lord of both if not yet candy 
despite of all her power shall be ruine 

urge i no far Annophill 

my lord 

thy father poverty have make thou happy 
for though it be true this solitary life 
suit not with youth and beauty oh my child 
yet it be the sweet guardian to protect 
chaste name from courtaspersion there a lady 
tender and delicate in year and grace 
that dote upon the charm of ease and pleasure 
be shipwrecked on the shore for it be much safe 
to trust the ocean in a leak ship 
then follow greatness in the wanton rite 
of luxury and sloth 

my wish sir 
have never soar a high flight then true 
to find occasion wherein I may witness 
my duty and obedience 

it be well say 
can thou forbear to laugh Arcanes 

why sir 

to look upon my beggary to look upon 
my patience in my beggary tell i 
do it show handsome brave 
handsome thou will flatter i 
and swear that I be miserable 

nothing 
more glorify the noble and the valiant 
then to despise contempt if you continue 
but to enjoy yourself you in yourself 
enjoy all store beside 

a excellent change 
I that some seven apprenticeship command 
a hundred minister that wait on 
my nod and sometime twenty thousand soldier 
be now retire attend in my age 
by one poor maid follow by one old man 

sir you be low in your own repute 
than you have reason for 

the roman captain 
I mean the best such as with their blood 
purchase their country peace the empire glory 
be glad at last to get they to some farm 
offfrom the clamour of the ingrateful great one 
and the unsteady multitude to live 
as I do now and it be their blessing too 
let it be we Arcanes 

I can but 
applaud your scorn of injury 

of injury 
Arcanes Annophill lend both your hand 
so what say you now 

why now my lord 

I swear 
by all my past prosperity thus stand 
between you two I think myself as great 
as mighty as if in the Capitol 
I stand amid the senator with all 
the Cretan subject prostrate at my foot 

sir you be here more safe 

and more belove 
why look you sir I can forget the weakness 
of the traduce soldier the neglect 
of the fairspoken senate the impiety 
of he the villain who to my dishonour 
the world miscall my son 
but by the 

sir remember that you promise no occasion 
shall move your patience

among we enter a servant

Antinous sit down 

madam 

I say sit down I do command you sit 
for look what honour thou do gain by i 
I can lose by it happy Antinous 
the grace and the high deity 
smile at thy birth and still continue it 
then think that I who scorn lesser example 
must do the like such as do taste my power 
and talk of it with fear and reverence 
shall do the same unto the man I favour 
I tell thou youth thou have a conquest win 
since thou come home great than that last 
which dignify thy same great than if 
thou shall go out again and conquer far 
for I be not ashamed to acknowledge 
myself subdue by thou 

great lady 

sit still I will not hear thou else now speak 
and speak like my Antinous like my soldier 
who Cupid and not mar have send to battle 

I must I see be silent 

So thou may 
there be great action in it than in clamour 
a look if it be gracious will begin the war 
a word conclude it then prove no coward 
since thou have such a friendly enemy 
that teach thou to conquer 

you do amaze i madam 
I have no skill no practice in this war 
and whether you be serious or please 
to make your sport on a deject man 
I can right guess but be it as it will 
it be a like unhappiness to i 
my discontent bear those condition in they music 
and lay i out so wretched no design 
however true promise a good 
can make i relish aught but a sweetbitter 
voluntary exile music again 

why a exile 
what comfort can there be in those companion enter Hyparcha 
which sad thought bring along with 

madam 

whence come this welltuned sound 

I know not madam 

listen wench 
whatever friendly hand they be that send it song 
let they play on they be master of their faculty 
do it please you sir 

accord to the time 

go to they wench 
and tell they we shall thank they for they have keep 
as good time to our disposition as to their instrument 
unless Antinous shall say he love enter Philander 
there never can be sweet accent utter 

let then the heart that do employ those hand 
receive some small share of your thanks with they 
it be happiness enough that you do like it 
a fortune unto i that I shall send it 
in such a lucky minute but to obtain 
so gracious welcome do exceed my hope 

good prince I thank you for it 

o madam pour not to fast joy on i 
but sprinkle they so gentle I may stand they 
it be enough at first you have lay aside 
those cruel angry look out of your eye 
with which as with your lovely you do strike 
all your beholder in a ecstasy 

Philander you have long profess to love i 

have I but profess it madam 

nay but hear i 

more attentive then to a oracle 

and I will speak more true if more can be 
nor shall my language be wrap up in riddle 
but plain as truth itself I love this gentleman 
who grief have make he so uncapable 
of love he will not hear at least not understand it 
I that have look with scornful eye on thou 
and other prince mighty in their state 
and in their friend as fortunate have now pray 
in a petitionary kind almost 
this man this well deserve man that I must say 
to look upon this beauty yet you see 
he cast his eye rather upon the ground 
than he will turn they this way Philander 
you look pale I will talk no more 

pray go forward I will be your martyr 
to die thus be immortal to live 

will you go to he then and speak for i 
you have love long but not fervent 
know how to speak for you have do it like 
a orator even for yourself then how will you for i 
who you profess to love above yourself 

the curse of dissembler follow i 
unto my grave and if I do not so 

you may as all man do speak bold better 
in their friend cause still then in your own 
but speak your utmost yet you can feign 
I will stand by and blush to witness it 
tell he since I behold he I have lose 
the happiness of this life food and rest 
a quiet bosom and the state I go with 
tell he how he have humble the proud 
and make the live but a dead Erota 
tell he withal that she be better please 
with think on he then enjoy these 
tell he Philander prince I talk in vain 
to you you do not mark i 

Indeed I do 

but thou do look so pale 
as thou will spoil the story in relate 

not if I can but live to tell it 

it may be you have not the heart 

I have a will I be sure however my heart 
may play the coward but if you please I will try 

if a kiss will strengthen thou I give you leave 
to challenge it nay I will give it you 

o that a man shall taste such heavenly bliss 
and be enjoin to beg it for another 

Alas it be a misery I grieve 
to put you to and I will suffer rather 
in his tyranny than thou in i 

nay madam since I can have your love 
I will endeavour to deserve your pity 
for I have rather have within the grave 
your love than you shall want it upon earth 
but how can I hope with a feeble tongue 
to instruct he in the rudiment of love 
when your most powerful beauty can work it 

do what thou will Philander the request 
be so unreasonable that I quit thou of it 
I desire now no more but the true patience 
and fortitude of lover with those help 
of sigh and tear which I think be all the physic 

o if he do but hear you it be enough 
and I will wake he from his apoplexy 
Antinous 

my lord 

nay pray 
no courtesy to i you be my lord 
indeed you be for you command her heart 
that command i nor can you want to know it 
for look you she that tell it you in word 
explain it now more passionate in tear 
either thou have no heart or a marble one 
if those drop can melt it prithee look up 
and see how sorrow sit within her eye 
and love the grief she go with if not her 
of which thou be the parent and never yet 
be there by nature that thing make so stony 
but it will love whatever it beget 

he that beget i do beget these care 
which be good issue though happy by he 
esteem monster nay the illjudging world 
be likely enough to give they those character 

what be this to love and to love and to the lady he be old 
wrathful perverse selfwilled and full of anger 
which be his fault but let they not be thou 
he thrust you from his love she pull thou on 
he doubt your virtue she do double they 
oh either use thy own eye or take i 
and with they my heart than thou will love she 
nay dote upon she more than on thy duty 
and man will praise thou equal for it 
neglect she condemn thou as a man 
unworthy such a fortune oh Antinous 
it be not the friendship that I bear to thou 
but her command that make i utter this 
and when I have prevail let she but say 
Philander you must die or this be nothing 
it shall be do together with a breath 
with the same willingness I live to serve she 

no more Philander 

all I have do be little yet to purpose 
but ere I leave he I will perceive he blush 
and make he feel the passion that I do 
and every true lover will assist i in it 
and lend i their sad sigh to blow it home 
for Cupid want a dart to wound this bosom 

no more no more Philander I can endure no more 
pray let he go go good Antinous make peace 
with your own mind no matter though I perish Ex 

I can help it 

nor do I require it 
the malady need no physician 
help hospital people 

I be glad to hear 
you be so valiant 

valiant 
can any man be proud that be not valiant 
foolish woman what will thou say thou 
I know not what to call thou 

I can you 
for I can call you coxcomb ass and puppy 

you do do it I thank you 

that you will lose a fortune 
which a cobbler better deserve than thou do

impudent traitor 

her o spare Antinous

as murder innocent lady will stamp on thou

solicit my love she vow at last 
she can not will not live unless I grant 
what she long sue for I in tender pity 
to save a lady of her birth from ruin 
give she her life and promise to be she 
nor urge I aught from she but secrecy 
and then enjoin she to supply such want 
as I perceive my father late engagement 
have make he subject to what shall I heap up 
long repetition she to quit my pity 
not only have discover to my father 
what she have promise to conceal but also 
have draw my life into this fatal forfeit 
for which since I must die crave a like 
equality of justice against she 
not that I covet blood but that she may not 
practise this art of falsehood on some other 
perhaps more worthy of her love hereafter 

if this be true 

my lord be as the law be 
indifferent upright I do plead guilty
