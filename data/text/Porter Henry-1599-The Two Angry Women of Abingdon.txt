nay wisdom bid i shun that passion 
than I will study for a remedy 
I have a daughter now heaven invocate

I will not have they graze upon this green 
I hope they will not for this crop be poor 
and they may pasture upon great store 
but yet it be pity that they let they pass 
and like a common bite the muse grass 
yet this I fear if Frank and I shall kiss 
some creek goose will chide we with a hiss 
I mean not that goose sing it know not what 
it be not that hiss when one say hist come hither 
nor that same hiss that set dog together 
nor that same hiss that by a fire do stand 
and hiss T or F upon the hand

for I shall sound sure if I hear that note 
and then green ginger for the green goose cry 
serve not the turn I turn the white of eye 
the rosasolis yet that make i live 
be favour that these gentleman may give 
but if they be displease then please be I 
to yield myself a hiss death to die 
yet I hope here be none consent to kill 
but kind take the favour of good will 
if any thing be in the pen to blame 
then here stand I to blush the writer shame 
if this be bad he promise a better 
trust he and he will prove a right true debtor
