and last of all to end a household strife 
it be the honey against a waspish wife

for every man must then be his wife slave 
Come therefore you shall teach our court to shine 
so calm a spirit be worth a golden mine 
wife with meek husband that to vex they long 
in bedlam must they dwell else dwell they wrong
