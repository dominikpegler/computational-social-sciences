to be thus cross 

the day of marriage set 
with the applausive vote of both the kingdom 
by a unlooked for war to be put of 
will vex a royal spleen

discreet and valiant if we may believe 
what his young fame proffer to every knowledge

just praise of he 

I have no thought so impious

but to obey her virgin sweetness make i 
her just admirer but when I observe 
her prudent manage of the state a strength 
will become many year her pious law 
but that without example make to advance 
her sex chastity I forget all 
beside worth praise though every least of her 
desert will ask a volume it be his excellence 

there be one not sorry for these war

profession soldier batten in a tempest 

and he deserve employment yet I think 
he will never purchase with his pay 

be confident 
your worth will plead alone the queen expect i

may cure ourselves by let other blood

your memorandum 

with all our heart sir 

we desire no more 

I will wait on you again 

fortune de la guerre 
my lord Leandro what paper that 
he so intentive peruse 

I like it and can willing allow 
the change the queen grow mighty in her spirit 
and this match with the prince will swell her state 
too much my lord 

we be you 

see what dangerous paper have be scatter 
to wound the title of our royal mistress 
my servant bring i this our enemy 
who call himself prince Ferdinand will fain 
have we believe he cousin to the queen 
she a usurper of his crown 

we all know he dead 

I be sure I do attend his funeral 

I think I wait too 

this paper say he be convey away 
and so escape his uncle cruelty 
to who protection he be leave a infant 
he die we translate our obedience 
to his daughter now our queen 

here be a impostor 

heaven aid the innocent say I he have 
Valentia aid and come not to invite 
but force a resignation I wish thing 
be calm again 

prince Leonario if she prosper not 
be like to be a loser too 

for he 
it matter not we have more to think on now 
than love and compliment 

I think he will be general 
against this pretend Ferdinand 

what else 
her sweet heart that give Cupid in his crest 
Alas there need no art nor strength of war 
to advance her cause justice will fight for she 
in the cloud and victory send from heaven without 
her soldier sweat will glorious descend 
to crown his head with laurel 

may it prove so 

I can say thing will stagger your belief 
but I forget the queen send for i to 
you both a servant 

I do not like my lord Leandro wind 
he have be faithful 

always honourable the queen 

I take this as the great honour madam 
you can confer my name be young in war 
but my affection to your royal person 
arm with the virtue of your cause shall make i 
do something worth your name 

it be your request 
nor can we place our chief command but where 
it be equal with your interest in we 
and your own merit 

sure my star do mean 
this way to make you know how much my heart 
dare in your service and if Ferdinand 
for so he call himself possess a soul 
above the vulgar make we shall spare 
the blood of many and conclude the war 
in single opposition 

with your highness pardon 
it not become you shall engage your person 
and so great a cause so dangerous 
it will be too much honour to the impostor 
and in the supposition of the world 
a strength to his pretence to bring your birth 
so low to humble both yourself and fortune 
to his unworthy level a thing grow 
up in the night a meteor hang in 
the air prodigious feed with vapour and 
black influence ambitious to deceive 
the world and challenge kindred with the star 
it be too great a venture sir 

since there must be a war 
let the army meet in battle there be more hope 
after the worst to reinforce and prosper 
than when the kingdom put upon one stake 
and one man chance to assure it 

I allow 
your counsel lord but have more argument 
convince i not to run such a hazard 
of what must make Olivia rich hereafter 
a kingdom loss may be repair but your 
life make a sacrifice to tyrant war 
May find a welcome to the other shade 
but no tear can invite you back to share 
or grief or joy with i I will have no duel 

it be a command and my obedience 
shall meet it though I fear it will be a sin 
to be too careful of myself but I 
shall still remember I be your soldier 
and this consider shall not make i rash 
but wise teach i to deserve this title 
which live but in your honour 

I will pray for you 
and not so much for what concern the state 
as what your merit have already gain 
upon my heart 

blessing upon they both 
a curse upon these war that spoil their mirth 

my lord Leandro 

there be your commission captain I suppose 
you have find way to empty your exchequer 

my bag be not brimful my lord I have 
defalk and make a ebb for wine and woman 
and other thing that keep poor man alive 
to do their country service 

please you walk 
with this gentleman captain he shall pay you 
five hundred piece that I owe you 

i your grace owe i nothing 

I can not pay the debt in better time sir 

umh I will take the money and allow the miracle 

do you observe the prince nobleness 
although the act become he yet the manner 
take i especial heaven preserve the captain 
from be mad 

I prosper in your vote 
but shall I madam if that power which crown 
with victory guide i with fair success 
in this your war and triumph smile upon we 
shall I at my return have that reward 
my soul next heaven affect shall no delay 
cold than frost to lover blood afflict 
my expectation of our marriage 
although to doubt this be a sin yet where 
the ambition be so just I shall but right 
my heart to have it oft assure nor can 
it make your eye less rich in smile when it be 
only my love encourage i to make 
the busy harmless question 

it do please i 
nor can you ask so often as I have 
a cheerfulness to answer that I love you 
and have propound nothing dear to i 
than that which perfect chaste affection 
and chain two heart the priest with sadness will 
expect you safe again but from this war 
when you return he shall not in his register 
of lover find one with more wing have meet 
the bosom of her friend than glad Olivia 
to make one soul with you 

I have enough 
and thirst for action in the field from whence 
I will bring harvest home or leave myself 
happy in life or death to do you service 

well I be afraid if Hymen shall set up 
his taper now they will not last to light 
his priest at their return to say his office 

hope fair 

I allow his spirit but 
the prince have not be practise in 
the school of war where stratagem prevail 
above all personal resolution 

he can want fit counsel to direct 
his early valour beside 
Ferdinand by computation as young as he 
may poise the scale see the captain 

we always think you noble and we hope 
you will take no offence that our occasion 
prevail above our modesty

entreat you to be witness of what money 
I pay these gentleman that have trust i

above expression

to serve the queen

why you unthankful son of false light sergeant 
take they to their rendezvous

to abate half our money 

All all good captain he shall have all rather

with as you be 

this be his project 

umh you will forgive i both your debt 

and pray heaven to forgive you too 

my lord bear witness 
these two will bribe i to abuse the queen 
and the present service be this less than treason 

oh Er nay nay captain

I mean for bulk ram i into a cannon 
if you shall buy yourselves with your estate 
from this employment il not cousin you 
your money be good debt still you may live 
and ask i for it again and I may pay you

that be at their peril 
when they come to the field but go they shall 
and they be my cousingerman 

good my lord speak for we 

you do not know my lord but a little suffering 
may save their soul and teach they if they come 
off with a quarter of their limb compassion 
to other man that venture their life for they 
their conscience be tough and must be supple 
when they shall fast and march ten month in armour 
sometime through river sometime over mountain 
and not have straw at night to keep their breech 
from grow to the earth in storm in heat 
when they have feel the softness of a trench 
thigh deep in water and their dung to fatten it 
when they shall see no meat within a month 
but chaw their match like liquorish and digest 
the bark of tree like salad in the summer 
when they shall live to think there be no such thing 
in nature as a thirst and wonder why 
a tailor be create when they have 
as much in ready shot within their flesh 
as will set up a plumber or repair 
a church with lead beside ten thousand more 
affliction which they be sure to find 
they may have christianity and not put 
a soldier to the payment of his debt 

it be a mad captain come my lord let we leave he 

you shall have time and place to send for money 
or make your will set on who know but you 
hereafter may be honest and prove captain 
you may have preferment in the war for money 
and so my gentle creditor march on 

the hope and care of many year be in 
one day destroy have heaven no stroke in war 
or be old providence asleep Leonario

young Ferdinand who I expect to 
salute a king his prisoner and the queen 
with her new conqueror glorious in the spoil 
by put out this light will mix their beam 
and burn our eye out with their shine there be 
no talk but of this triumph and the people 
who I by art and secret murmur have 
make doubtful at the first noise of this conquest 
as they have borrow soul from fear and folly 
adore the rise star and in the praise 
of he and his great fate wonder that heaven 
shall hold a sun and he so bright nor with 
this flattery content but they condemn 
as low as all their sin shall one day they 
he who the chance of war have make a prisoner 
there be no trust to policy or time 
the thing of state be whirl by destiny 
to meet their period art can repair they

command none be want to attend 
with all the state that may become she to 
congratulate the triumph now bring home

it be not safe to wear a brow but what 
the queen example first form into smile 
I here contract my knowledge and seclude 
my wish since they prosper not I be 
her chancellor as great office and high 
employment do expose we to most danger 
they oft teach those possess they a statewisdom 
and by inherent virtue of the place 
our fear to lose make we secure ourselves 
by art more often than by conscience 
but I may be endanger to suspicion 
I like not thing but I delay my attendance

without a fresh wound that thy love to i 
shall be so ill reward thou have engage 
thyself too much already it be within 
thy will yet to be safe reveal thyself 
throw of the cloud that do eclipse that brightness 
and they will court thy person and be proud 
with all becominghonor to receive thou 
no fear shall rob thy cheek of her chaste blood 
o leave i to my own star and expect 
whatever become of wretched Ferdinand 
a happy fate 

your council be unkind 
this language will become your charity 
to a stranger but my interest be more 
in thou than thus with word to be send off 
our vow have make we one nor can the name 
of father country or what can be dear 
in nature bribe one think to wish myself 
in heaven without thy company it be poor then 
to leave thou here then by thy faith I charge thou

by all our promise when we do flatter 
ourselves and in our fancy take the world 
a piece and collect what do like 
they best to make we a new paradise 
by that the noble ornament of thy soul 
thy honour I conjure thou let i still 
be undiscovered what will it avail 
to leave i who thou love and walk alone 
sad pilgrim to another world we will 
converse in soul and shoot like star who beam 
be twist and make bright the sullen grove 
of lover as we pass 

these be but dream 
of happiness be wise Rosania 
thy love be not a friend to make thou miserable 
society in death where we affect 
but multiply our grief live thou o live 
and if thou have a tear when I be dead 
but drop it to my memory it shall 
more precious than embalm dwell upon i 
and keep my ash pure my spirit shall 
at the same instant in some innocent shape 
descend upon that earth thou have bedew 
and kiss the bright tribute of thy eye 
shall after wait like thy good angel on thou 
there will be none to speak of Ferdinand 
without disdain if thou die too o live 
a little to defend i or at least 
to say I be no traitor to thy love 
and lay the shame on death and my false star 
that will not let i live to be a king 

o Ferdinand 
thou do not love i now 

not love Rosania 
if woo thou to live will not assure thou 
command i then to die and spare the cruelty 
of the fair queen not love Rosania 
if thou will but delight to see i bleed 
I will at such a narrow passage let 
out life it shall be many hour in ebb 
and my soul bathe in the crimson stream 
take pleasure to be drown I have small time 
to love and be alive but I will carry 
so true a faith to woman hence as shall 
make poor the world when I be go to tell 
the story yonder we be interrupt 

you must prepare yourself for present trial 
I have command to attend you to the judge 
that gentleman and all that do adhere 
to your conspiracy be by the queen 
most gracious mercy pardon 

in that word 
thou have bring i more than life I shall betray 
and with my too much joy undo thou again 
heaven do command thou live I must obey 
this summons I shall see thou again Tiberio 
before I die 

I will wait upon you sir 
the queen will not deny i that poor office 
I know not how to leave you 

death and I 
shall meet and be make friend but when we part 
the world shall find thy story in my heart 

be that the prisoner at the bar 

he that pretend himself Ferdinand 
your uncle son 

proceed to his arraignment my lord Leandro 
you know our pleasure 

although the queen in her own royal power 
and without violate sacred justice where 
treason come to invade she and her crown 
with open war need not insist upon 
the form and circumstance of law but use 
her sword in present execution 
yet such be the sweet temper of her blood 
and calmness of her nature though provoke 
Ino a storm unto the great offender 
she shut up no defence will to give 
a satisfaction to the world how much 
she do delight in mercy Ferdinand 
for so thou do pretend thyself thou be 
indict of high treason to her majesty 
in that thou have usurp relation to 
her blood and under name of be her kinsman 
not only haste contrive to blast her honour 
with neighbour prince but have gather arm 
to wound the precious bosom of her country 
and tear the crown which heaven and just succession 
have place upon her royal head what can 
thou answer to this treason 

bold thus 
as I be never with the height of all 
my expectation and the aid of friend 
transport one degree above myself 
so must not Ferdinand though his star have frown 
and the great eye of providence seem to slumber 
while your force thus compel and bring i hither 
with mockery of my fate to be arraign 
for be a prince have any think beneath 
the title I be bear to yet I will not call 
this cruelty in you nor in the queen 
if I may name she so without injustice 
to my own right a kingdom be a garland 
worth all contention and where right seal not 
the true possession nature be forget 
and blood think cheap to assure it there be something 
within that excellent figure that restrain 
a passion here that else will forth like lightning 
it be not your shape which yet have so much sweetness 
some pale religious hermit may suspect 
you be the bless saint he pray too no 
the magic be in our nature and our blood 
for both our vein full of one precious purple 
strike harmony in their motion I be Ferdinand 
and you the fair Olivia brother child 

what insolence be this 

o my lord let he 
be free to plead for if it be no dream 
his cause will want a orator by my blood 
he do talk brave 

these be flourish 

speak to the treason you be charge with 
and confess a guilt 

he justify himself 

if it be treason to be bear a prince 
to have my father royal blood move here 
if it be treason in my infancy 
to have escape by divine providence 
when my poor life shall have be sacrifice 
to please a cruel uncle who ambition 
surprise my crown and after make Olivia 
his daughter queen if it be treason to 
have be a stranger thus long from my country 
breed up with silence of my name and birth 
and not till now mature to own myself 
before a sunbeam if it be treason 
after so long a banishment to weep 
a tear of joy upon my country bosom 
and call her mine my just inheritance 
unless you stain my blood with bastardy 
if it be treason still to love this earth 
that know so many of my race her king 
though late unkind arm to kill her sovereign 
as if the effusion of my blood be leave 
to make her fertile if to love Olivia 
my near pledge of blood although her power 
have chain her prince and make her lord her prisoner 
who sit with expectation to hear 
that sentence that must make the golden wreath 
secure upon her brow by blast i

thank you for his reward and lose his head for it 

we always see that man in such high nature 
deform and guilty want not specious shape 
to gain their practice friendship and compassion 
but he shall feel the punishment do you smile 

a woman anger be but worth it madam 
and if I may have freedom I must say 
not in contempt of what you seem nor help 
by overcharge of passion which but make 
a fruitless noise I have a sense of what 
I be to lose a life but I be so fortify 
with valiant thought and innocence I shall 
when my last breath be give up to lose 
its self in the air be so remote from fear 
that I will cast my face into one smile 
which shall when I be dead acquit all tremble 
and be a story to the world how free 
from paleness Ferdinand take leave of earth

that when our pleasure be know not to proceed 
they dare be officious in his sentence be

I not suspect his wisdom sir but he 
have no commission here to be a judge

let i but see one curl in any brow 
attend the prisoner hither kiss our hand

a sea tempestuous in her anger I 
never think she will marry he 

she be the queen 
but with what honour she can quit the prince 
who without treason do deserve she too 
come not within my reach 

if you consider 
he have be valiant for she to great purpose 
and bring a prisoner home to mount his jennet

of triumph and the queen already teem 
to bless the kingdom with a heir and yet 
you see I walk like a poor neighbour prince

I praise the influence of my star there be 
a fire in Cupid quiver that will scorch

and be not judge of what thou know not dear 

I know too much 

that I be marry

you be too rash for there be truth in i 
in Ferdinand though in thy thought hold black 
and stain prodigious with breach of faith 
I have not break my vow do not compel i 
by thy unbelief to do a sin I hate 
as much as I love thou 

have you a soul 

yes and thy eye shall read it be but calm 
that soul thou once do love white with his first 
simplicity and faith I will urge 
in my excuse the beauty of the queen 
enough to melt a scythian into love 
but call to mind my dear Rosania 
and do but put upon thou Ferdinand 
so late forget by his star a prisoner 
slave like a villain at the bar expect 
at every breath his sentence nay admit 
Rosania the best part of his soul 
stand like a weep fountain to take leave 
of what she never must salute again 
in this extreme to preserve Ferdinand 
and save Rosania will thou scorn the breath 
of mercy that do court thou from the lip 
of a great queen can thou love Rosania 
if thou be Ferdinand to lose thyself 
who she will follow in a stream of tear 
and when she have make a island of thy tomb 
strive to swim to thou she can not choose 
but drown herself in her own wave I prithee 
take reason to thou and when thou have consider 

persuade i I be not Rosania 
and I will say it be virtue and that yet 
your heart may grow with i be not the queen 
possess of that which shall have be my title 
a wife to Ferdinand 

it be confess the world 
do think it so I do consent to ceremony 

call you enjoy of the queen but ceremony 

pause there and if thou have but so much charity 
to think I dare not blaspheme heaven I will call 
that and the angel bold to my witness 
the queen be to i a stranger yet 

a miracle 

retain but love as thou preserve thy sweetness 
and that will teach thou to believe that Ferdinand 
however salute king be still thy subject 
and though her husband in my faith to thou 
the marriage bed have still our virgin sheet 
a brother may embrace a sister with 
the heat I bring that this be truth the power 
and name I have shall only serve to make 
our flight secure into another kingdom 
and when I part with these new shine glory 
thy faith will be confirm and thou acknowledge 
I venture much to keep my heart thy servant 

I know not what to say be not the queen 
displease 

she be but cunning disguise 
her passion to the world but I forget 
what must enlarge my fear of her revenge 
if thou be know Rosania 

lose that fear 
I be still safe and now I see the cause 
make she repent her favour and thy greatness 
forgive i Ferdinand and yet I know not 
all be not well there be poison in this balsam 
prepare for thou 

from who 

Rosania 

when she shall but consent to have i die 
she shall not trouble poison to send off 
my despise life my soul in just obedience 
to her command will take a cheerful flight 
in hope to serve she in the other world 

you shall know more hereafter and let this 
secure your thought she yet believe i what 
this shape present but without wise prevention 
I fear I shall not live too long conceal 
I dare not say her honour be a bleed 
but a queen thus distaste may not find 
that ice within her blood we be interrupt 

your pardon sir it be the queen pleasure 
this gentleman attend she in the gallery 

he shall wait her command 
I know not what to counsel it be not safe 
sweet to neglect she yet my fear of some 
ill fate be round about i like a mist 
and dark my understanding let a kiss 
and silence teach our soul some new discourse 

why here be a volume of intelligence 
I will stay no long to expect the prince 
but seek he out immediate disguise 
king by your leave I shall untruss your mistress 

I know not what I feel nor what to fear 
if love ever mean a tragedy it be here 

if we never meet again one more salute 
shall fortify our life by join breath 
nor shall our last hard fate deny we this 
to change our faithful soul at our last kiss 

I know not what to think on it but if I 
have any sense there be some new state madness 
creep into court 

be we not all asleep 
and these fine dream perplex we 

no it be wake 

show i the ten part of a reason why 
the queen do marry he 

it be destiny 

why since shall he be melancholy 

or she so humorous 

not lie together pray heaven the gentleman 
be find with no defective title in he 

observe her favour to that boy he be 
his servant now her minion I like not 
these violent wheel the whole frame may be soon 
endanger if these passion be not cure 

new lodging for he near her own and he 
give free access to the bedchamber 

it be nought 
or will be so I pity the good king 
though she have raise he to the high glory 
her power extend too yet to make this height 
his precipice and throw he into scorn 
nay poison the best hope he have of honour 
and love from she and in his sight to court 
a boy his servant it will vex the best 
of all our temper if we feel the sting on it 

he be here that lady be the queen cabinet 

they be merry about the mouth 

another summons 
it be possible the queen may marry he too 

there be some mystery we can reach 
if we do well remember there be a law 
make by herself as soon as she be queen 
to keep wife pulse temperate and correct 
the insolent blood of woman that have husband 

and man be not exempt 

I say no more 
but heaven maintain the law and the lawmaker 
and conjure down that devil 
it be the king and the smooth boy let we leave they 

be this the lady message do the queen 
take thou into such favour 

I tell truth 
and though it sound but ill on the queen part 
because she think i what I seem my lord 
you need not to wear one cloud upon your face 
when you remember who I be my fear 
be thick upon my heart how to secure 
this shadow any long 

that afflict 
i most Rosania for it please i 
to hear she can affect thou but what way 
to keep her expectation high and thou 
my dear safe her passion may be violent 

they be already sir if I mistake not

to do the office of a husband to she 
that peace will keep her bosom clear and I

obey what thou desire and do the office 
of a husband ha 

I will wait upon you still 
and hope you will vouchsafe i now and then 
a harmless smile her beauty will deserve 
your whole heart and there be something in the memory 
of what she have advance you to will help 
to make you kind 

shall I enjoy the queen 
because the misery of my fate compel 
a ceremonious sin shall I betray 
the essence of my faith and leave a curse 
when thou be know upon my name for ever 
if thou have take new resolve against i 
punish my heart some other way have she 
more ornament than ever meet in woman 
mistress of more perfection than poet

one night embrace my body shall not carry 
my soul so far astray the man condemn 
to live in a perpetual snow have not 
a pure frost within his blood 

This but 
engender a new grief although it bind 
Rosania heart there be yet one way leave 
and that ere I pronounce you must forgive 
there be a tremble in my tongue and I 
already feel such winter in my breath

so like a loss of these that I be leave 
a piece of shake earth death can look 
to make i tremble so can thou forsake i 

not in my heart but give my body leave 
to seek some other place my lord to dwell in 
when I be go into some wilderness

and perfect all I will pray you may live happy 
and hold intelligence with some gentle wind 
that shall convey my wish and return

a breach of chastity by so black example 
if the king urge a execution 
of what our vote confirm by you impose 
upon the kingdom you shall prove yourself 
more innocent or give we cause to mourn 
this fall from virtue
