and have of late spoil all the sheep in the exchequer 

And throw the chief merchant over board

and so God save the queen 

and have you do now sir 

I have farewell 

farewell Mr pursuivant he have so fill my head with proclamation Exit 

now valiant mate you have maintain this fight with courage and with wont hardiment the spoil of this rich ship we will divide in equal share and not the mean of any but by the custom of the sea may challenge accord to his place right in the spoil though outlaw we keep law among ourselves else we can have no certain government 

a gallant prize and brave purchase too with loss of blood on both side a sea fight be never better manage nor exploit with more exchange of hostile opposition we do not look for such a valiant spirit in any merchant breast nor do we think a ship of such small burden so weak mane will have endure so hot and proud a fight 

nor do I think the providence of heaven will so have favour man of base condition such as profess wrong piracy and theft have spoil my man and ransack every corner of my surprise bark seize all my substance and share among you my best merchandise and not alone undo i and in i all that be i but in overwhelm we shake the estate of all my creditor 

what be that to we man of our know condition must cast behind our hack all such respect we leave our conscience upon the land when we begin to rob upon the sea 

we know we be pirate and profess to rob and will not have we free use our trade if thou and thou be quite undo by we we make by thou impute it to thy fortune and not to any injury in we 
for he that be bear to be a beggar know 
however he toil and traffic must die so 

if you must needs possess this thrive trade yet since the sea afford such choice of store you may methinks have spare your own countryman 

nay since our country have proclaim we pirate and cut we off from any claim in England we will be no long now call english man 

Clinton I know thou and have use thy skill ere now in a good vessel of my own before thou take this desperate course of life perhaps if now thou do i a good office time may enable i to quit thy love 

troth I can wish we have light of any other but since thy fate have cast thou upon we we must neglect no opportunity for they that intermit advantage must know occasion head be bald behind my merry mate come top your can apace pile up your chest with prize to the lid and stuff the vast hold of our empty ship with such rich ware as this our prize afford supple your biscuit with such choice of wine 
as free come bring by the auspicious wind 
to unlade themselves and seek for stowage here 
since wine come free let we make spare of beer 

let can of wine pass round in health through all such golden prize come not every day nor can we always meet such choice of spoil first bind the merchant lay he fast in hold and have seize all his best merchandise pierce with your ordnance through his ship craze keel and sink she down into the deep abyss whence not all the crane in Europe or the world can weigh she out again 

let it be so lest she prove prize unto a second foe 

be it as my fate shall please my loss I value but as good lend i now to be pay back but that which most afflict my sorrowful soul be that my friend have venture large with i especial my sister who I fear will brook that ill which I with patience bear 

place he below the hatch as our prisoner and now to part our purchase brave win even with the hazard of our dear life 

the danger pass still make the purchase sweet Come first drink round my merry mate that do divide in peace what we by war have win exeunt 

gentleman and my merry mate at sea those special savour you have crown i with can never be deserve upon my part so weak be my ability and knowledge in navigation and exploit at sea yet since your love so far exceed my worth that of a unexperienced gentleman you have prefer i above many other to be your captain and command your ship I hope to bear myself so even and upright in this my charge that it shall not repent you of the least honour to my grace decree 

our captain be late slay in fight we by your valour escape our enemy and make their ship our prize since we first know you all our attempt succeed prosperous and heaven have better bless we for your sake 

when first we take you to our fellowship we have a poor bark of some fifteen tun and that be all our riches but since then we have take many a rich prize from Spain and get a gallant vessel stout mane and well provide of ordnance and small shot man and ammunition that we now dare cope with any carack that do trade for Spain 

we dare do any thing that stand with justice our country honour and the reputation of our own name but among all our spoil I wonder we have escape the valiant pirate that be so much renown upon the sea that be a conquest worth the hazard beside a thousand pound reward propose to that adventurer that can bring they in my peace and pardon though a man condemn be by the proclamation ratify 

the ocean scarce can bear their outrage they be so violent confound all and spare none not their own countryman we can not do our country great service than in their pursuit to engage our life 

I can we meet those rover on the sea so famous for their piracy and theft so fear of all that trade for merchandise so proud of their strong vessel and stout ging that man she with their proud artillery that thunder wrack to every ship alike o with what ardour and inflame desire will we in the mid sea encounter they climb to the maintop boy see what you ken there 

I shall I shall sir 

we seek for purchase but we take it from foe and such be hold among we lawful spoil but such as be our friend and countryman we succour with the best supply we have of victual or munition be distress 

ho there

now how be it with thou Clinton 

well well 

but be it not better when we reign as lord nay king at sea the ocean be our realm and the light billow in the which we sail our hundred nay our shire and province that bring we annual profit those be day 

yes golden day but now our last night be come and we must sleep in darkness 

worthy mate we have a flash leave of some half hour long that let we burn out brave not behind we leave a black noisome snuff of cowardice in the nostril of our noble countryman let we die no base example 

think Tom wanton who storm can never move tempest daunt rock terrify nor swallow gulf affright to who the base abyss in rough rage show like a pleasant garden in a calm and the seamonster but like beast at land of profit or pleasure Clinton can be affright with a halter hemp he strangle that think of he so base 

in that word thou have put a second sentence of our life yet Clinton never be it my thought of thou o the naval triumph thou and I have see nay ourselves make when on the sea at once have be as many bonfire as in town kindle upon a night of jubilee as many ordnance thunder in the cloud as at king coronation and dead body heave from the hatch and cast overboard as fast and thick as in some common pest when the plague sweep city 

that it have sweep we then too so the sea have be to we a glorious monument where now the fate have cast we on the shelf to hang betwixt air and water 

gentleman your limit hour draw nigh 

i that be the plague we speak of yet no great than some before have taste and hereafter many be bind to suffer and if Purser as die man seldom deem amiss presage not wrong how many gallant spirit equal with we in fame shall this gulf swallow and make this silver oar to blush in blood how many captain that have awe the sea shall fall on this infortunate piece of land some that command land some to who the indian mine pay tribute Turk veil but when we that have quake nay trouble flood and make armada fly before our stream shall founder thus be split and lose 
then be it no impeachment to their fame 
since Purser and bold Clinton bide the same 

what be our ship well tackle we may launch upon this desperate voyage 

cord brave 

call up the boatswain sound lash the slave with a rope end have he unto the chest or duck he at the mainyard 

have i to the chest I must first have you to the gallow and for duck I be afraid I shall see you duck and drake too 

o you brave navigator that have see or ever have yourselves command aboard that know our empire there and our fall now pity at least we that be make the scorn of a base common hangman 

thou do ill to offend they in their death 

I have and long to make a end of they 

have thou but two month since wrinkle a brow look but askew much less unloose thy lip to speak speak say I nay but lodge a thought or murmur of the least affront to we thou base of all worm meat I have make unwholesome food for haddock but I have do 

enough Tom Watton with these sheet not sail a stiff gale blow to split we on yon rock 

And set sail from the fatal marshal sea and Wapping be our harbour a quick sand that shall swallow many a brave marine soldier of who valour experience skill and naval discipline be lose I wish this land may never have need but what star must we sail by or what compass 

I know not the star but here be your compass 

yes that way point the needle that way we steer a sad course plague of the pilot hear you Mr sheriff you see we wear good clothes they be pay for and our own then give we leave our own among our friend to distribute there be sir for you 

and you 

the work man make they take never measure on a hangman back wear they for our sake and remember we there be some content for he too 

thank your worship 

I will your knaveship have our worship place if hang now be hold so worshipful 

but now our sun be all set night come on the watery wilderness over which we reign prove in our ruin peaceful Mr Chant trade fearless abroad as in the river mouth and free as in a harbour then fair Thames queen of fresh water famous through the world and not the least through we who double tide must overflow our body and be dead may thy clear wave our scandal wash away but keep our valour live now lead on Clinton thus arm in arm let we march to death and wheresoever our name be memorize 
the world report two valiant pirate fall 
shoot betwixt wind and water so farewell exeunt as they enter 

a father blessing more than all thy honour crown thou and make thy fortune grow still o heaven I shall be too importunate to ask more earthly favour at your hand now that you after all these misery have still reserve my son safe and unscorned beside thy pardon and thy country freedom what favour have her grace confer on thou 

more than my pardon and the meed propose to grace the rest she style i with the order of knighthood and for the service of my country with promise of employment of more weight the pirate be commit to the Marshalsea condemn already and this day to die and now as part of my neglect duty it rest I visit that fair gentlewoman to who I stand indebt for my life that necessary duty once perform out of my present fortune to distribute some present comfort to my sister want 

a grateful friend thou be a kind dear brother and a most love son

and that be some question 

wherefore have that word strike you with sudden sadness 

my husband

what kiss already then I smell another wedding towards and in no fit time than now prepare yourselves gentleman and gentlewoman make a hall for I come to present you with a mask 

what mask 

not such as lady wear upon their face to keep the foul from the fair but a plain mask or rather more proper I may call it a mum because the presenter have scarce a word to speak for themselves 

if there be any that appear as friend and come to grace our feast in courtesy admit they prithee 

that shall I sir and with all expedition 
and that without drum without fife or musician 
these two line shall serve for the prologue now enter scaena prima dramatis personae these be the actor yet let i entreat you not to condemn they before you hear they speak 

amazement startle i be these my brother 

by the father side it shall seem for you know he be a hard man and it shall seem it be but a hard world with they 

and these my false friend that disinherit heaven and put their faith in riches I pray gentleman how come this change 

how come this change say you no change of pastor which they say make fat calf but change of drink change of woman change of ordinary change of game and one wench in the change all these help to make this change in we 

and change be no robbery I have be rob but not at ruff yet they that have rob you see what a poor stock they have leave i a whore steal away my maidenhead ill company my good condition a broker rob i of my apparel drink of my wit and dice of my money
