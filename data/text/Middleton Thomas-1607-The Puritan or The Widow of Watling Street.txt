at their fresh sight 

sister 

away 
all honesty with he be turn to clay 
o my sweet husband o 

my dear father 

here be a pule indeed I think my mother weep for all the woman that ever bury husband for if from time to time all the widower tear in England have be bottle up I do not think all will have fill a threehalfpenny bottle alas a small matter buck a handkerchief and sometime the spital stand too nigh saint Thomas a watering well I can mourn in good sober sort as well as another but where I spend one tear for a dead father I can give twenty kiss for a quick husband 

well go thy way old sir Godfrey and thou may be proud on it thou have a kind love sisterinlaw how constant how passionate how full of April the poor soul eye be well I will my brother know on it he shall then know what a kind wife he have leave behind he truth and it be not for shame that the neighbour at the next garden shall hear i between joy and grief I shall even cry outright 

So a fair riddance my father be lay in dust his coffin and he be like a wholemeatpie and the worm will cut he up short farewell old dad farewell I will be curb in no more I perceive a son and heir may quick be make a fool and he will be one but I will take another order now she will have i weep for he forsooth and why because he cozen the right heir be a fool and bestow those land upon i his elder son and therefore I must weep for he ha ha why all the world know as long as it be his pleasure to get i it be his duty to get for i I know the law in that point no attorney can gull i well my uncle be a old ass and a admirable coxcomb I will rule the roast myself I will be keep under no more I know what I may do well enough by my father copy the law be in my own hand now nay now I know my strength I will be strong enough for my mother I warrant you 

what be to be do now old lad of war thou that be wont to be as hot as a turnspit as nimble as a fencer and as lousy as a schoolmaster now thou be put to silence like a sectary war sit now like a justice of peace and do nothing where be your musket caliver and hotshot in Longlane at pawn at pawn now key be your only gun keygun keygun and bawd the gunner who be your sentinel in peace and stand ready charge to give warning with hem hum and pockycough only your chamber be licence to play upon you and drab enough to give fire to they 

well I can tell but I be sure it go wrong with i for since the cessure of the war I have spend above a hundred crown out a purse I have be a soldier any time this forty year and now I perceive a old soldier and a old courtier have both one destiny and in the end turn both into hobnail 

pretty mystery for a beggar for indeed a hobnail be the true emblem of a beggar shoesole 

I will not say but that war be a bloodsucker and so but in my conscience as there be no soldier but have a piece of one though it be full of hole like a shot ancient no matter it will serve to swear by in my conscience I think some kind of peace have more hide oppression and violent heady sin though look of a gentle nature than a profess war 

troth and for my own part I be a poor gentleman and a scholar I have be matriculate in the university wear out six gown there see some fool and some scholar some of the city and some of the country keep order go bareheaded over the quadrangle eat my commons with a good stomach and battle with discretion at last have do many sleight and trick to maintain my wit in use as my brain will never endure i to be idle I be expel the university only for steal a cheese out of jesus college 

be it possible 

oh there be one Welshman God forgive he pursue it hard and never leave till I turn my staff towards London where when I come all my friend be pithole go to grave as indeed there be but a few leave before then be I turn to my wit to shift in the world to tower among son and heir and fool and gull and lady old son to work upon nothing to feed out of flint and ever since have my belly be much behold to my brain but now to return to you old Skirmish I say as you say and for my part wish a turbulence in the world for I have nothing to lose but my wit and I think they be as mad as they will be and to strengthen your argument the more I say a honest war be better than a bawdy peace as touch my profession the multiplicity of scholar hatch and nourish in the idle calm of peace make they like fish one devour another and the community of learning have so play upon affection and thereby almost religion be come about to fantasy and discredit by be too much speak off in so many and mean mouth I myself be a scholar and a graduate have no other comfort by my learning but the affliction of my word to know how scholarlike to name what I want and can call myself a beggar both in Greek and latin and therefore not to cog with peace I will not be afraid to say it be a great breeder but a barren nourisher a greatgetter of child which must either be thief or richman knave or beggar 

well will I have be bear a knave then when I be bear a beggar for if the truth be know I think I be beget when my father have never a penny in his purse

widow I have be a mere stranger for these part that you live in nor do I ever know the husband of you and father of they but I true know by certain spiritual intelligence that he be in purgatory 

purgatory tuh that word deserve to be spit upon I wonder that a man of sober tongue as you seem to be shall have the folly to believe there be such a place 

well lady in cold blood I speak it I assure you that there be a purgatory in which place I know your husband to reside and wherein he be like to remain till the dissolution of the world till the last general bonfire when all the earth shall melt into nothing and the sea scald their finny labourer so long be his abidance unless you alter the property of your purpose together with each of your daughter they that be the purpose of single life in yourself and your elder daughter and the speedy determination of marriage in your young 

how know he that what he have some devil tell he 

strange he shall know our thought 
why but daughter have you purpose speedy marriage 

you see she tell you ay for she say nothing nay give i credit as you please I be a stranger to you and yet you see I know your determination which must come to i metaphysical and by a supernatural intelligence 

This put amazement on i

I will think to steal a marriage will his tongue 
have drop out when he blab it 

but sir my husband be too honest a deal man to be now in any purgatory

I know he get his wealth with a hard gripe 
o hardly hardly 

this be most strange of all how know he that 

he will eat fool and ignorant heir clean up 
and have his drink from many a poor man brow 
even as their labour brew it 
he will scrape riches to he most unjust 
the very dirt between his nail be illgot 
and not his own o 
I groan to speak on it the thought make i shudder shudder

oh 

a man that will keep church so duly rise early before his servant and even for religious haste go ungartered unbutton nay sir reverence untrust to morning prayer 

o uff

there be the devil there be the devil true he think it sanctity enough if he have kill a man so it have be do in a pew or undo his neighbour so it have be near enough to the preacher o a sermon be a fine short cloak of a hour long and will hide the upperpart of a dissembler church ay he seem all church and his conscience be as hard as the pulpit 

I can no more endure this 

nor I widow 
endure to flatter 

be this all your business with i

you may believe my strain I strike all true 
and if your conscience will leap up to your tongue yourself will affirm it and that you shall perceive I know of thing to come as well as I do of what be present a brother of your husband shall short have a loss

if this be true we be all shame all undo

but if it so come to pass as for your fair sake I wish it may that this presage of your strange fortune be prevent by that accident of death and bloodshedding which I before tell you off take heed upon your life that two of you which have vow never to marry seek you out husband with all present speed and you the three that have such a desire to outstrip chastity look you meddle not with a husband

how now who be that what be you 

the same that I shall be captain 

George pieboard honest George why come thou in half face muffle so 

o captain I think we shall never have laugh again never spend frolic hour again

I come to prepare thou and with news 
as happy as thy quick delivery 
be trace out by the scent arrest captain

almost as many as George stone the bear 
three at once three at once 

how do thou shake they to then 

the time be busy and call upon our wit let it suffice 
here I stand safe and escape by miracle 
some other hour shall tell thou when we will steep 
our eye in laughter captain my device 
lean to thy happiness for ere the day 
be spend to the girdle thou shall be set free 
the corporal be in his first sleep the chain be miss 
thy kinsman have express thou and the old knight 
with palieyhams now labour thy release 
what rest be all in thou to conjure captain 

conjure 'sfoot George you know the devil a conjure I can conjure 

the devil of conjure nay by my faith I will not have thou do so much captain as the devil a conjure look here I have bring thou a circle ready character and all 

'sfoot George be in thy right wit do know what thou say why do talk to a captain a conjure do thou ever hear of a captain conjure in thy life do call it a circle it be too wide a thing my think have it be a lesser circle than I know what to have do 

why every fool know that captain nay then I will not cog with you captain if you will stay and hang the next session you may 

no by my faith George come come let we to conjure let we to conjure 

but if you look to be release as my wit have take pain to work it and all mean wrought to far it beside to put crown in your purse to make you a man of better hope and where as before you be a captain or poor soldier to make you now a commander of rich fool which be true the only best purchase peace can allow you safe than highway heath or cunnygrove and yet a far better booty for your great thief be never hang never hang for why they be wise and cheat within door and we geld fool of more money in one night than your false tailed gelding will purchase in a twelvemonth run which confirm the old beldame say he be wise that keep himself warm that be he that rob by a good fire 

Well open i'faith George thou have pull that say out of the husk 

captain idle it be no time now to delude or delay the old knight will be here sudden I will perfect you direct you tell you the trick on it it be nothing 

'sfoot George I know not what to say to it conjure I shall be hang ere I conjure 

nay tell not i of that captain you will never conjure after you be hang I warrant you look you sir a perilous matter sure first to spread your circle upon the ground then with a little conjure ceremony as I will have a hackneyman wand silver over a purpose for you then arrive in the circle with a huge word and a great trample as for instance have you never see a stalkingstamping player that will raise a tempest with his tongue and thunder with his heel 

o yes yes yes often often 

why be like such a one for any thing will blear the old knight eye for you must note that he will never dare to venture into the room only perhaps peep fearful through the keyhole to see how the play go forward 

well I may go about it when I will but mark the end on it I shall but shame myself i'faith George speak big word and stamp and stare and he look in at keyhole why the very thought of that will make i laugh outright and spoil all nay I will tell thou George when I apprehend a thing once I be of such a laxative laughter that if the devil himself stand by I shall laugh in his face 

puh that be but the babe of a man and may easy be hush as to think upon some disaster some sad misfortune as the death of thy father in the country 

'sfoot that will be the more to drive i into such a ecstasy that I shall never lin laugh 

why then think upon go to hang else 

mass that be well remember now I will do well I warrant thou never fear i now but how shall I do George for boisterous word and horrible name 

puh any fustian invocation captain will serve as well as the best so you rant they out well or you may go to a apothecary shop and take all the word from the box 

troth and you say true George there be strange word enough to raise a hundred quacksalver though they be never so poor when they begin but here lie the fear on it how in this false conjuration a true devil shall pop up indeed 

a true devil captain why there be never such a one nay faith he that have this place be as false a knave as our last churchwarden 

then he be false enough a conscience i'faith George
