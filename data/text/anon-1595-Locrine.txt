a mighty lion ruler of the wood 
of wondrous strength and great proportion 
with hideous noise scar the tremble tree 
with yell clamour shake all the earth 
traverse the grove and chase the wander beast 
long do he range amid the shady tree 
and drive the silly beast before his face 
when sudden from out a thorny bush 
a dreadful archer with his bow bend 
wound the lion with a dismal shaft 
so he he stroke that it draw forth the blood 
and fill his furious heart with fret ire 
but all in vain he threaten tooth and paw 
and sparkle fire from forth his flame eye 
for the sharp shaft give he a mortal wound 
so valiant Brutus the terror of the world 
who only look do scar his enemy 
the archer death bring to his late end 
o what may long abide above this ground 
in state of bliss and healthful happiness 

most loyal lord and faithful follower 
that have with i unworthy general 
pass the greedy gulf of ocean 
leave the confine of fair Italy 
behold your Brutus draw nigh his end 
and I must leave you though against my will 
my sinew shrink my numb sense fail 
a chill cold possess all my bone 
black ugly death with visage pale and win 
present himself before my dazzle eye 
and with his dart prepare be to strike 
these arm my lord these never daunt arm 
that oft have quell the courage of my foe 
and eke dismay my neighbour arrogancy 
now yield to death overlay with crooked age 
devoid of strength and of their proper force 
even as the lusty cedar wear with year 
that far abroad her dainty odour throw 
among all the daughter of proud Lebanon 
this heart my lord this near appall heart 
that be a terror to the border land 
a doleful scourge unto my neighbour king 
now by the weapon of unpartial death 
be cleave asunder and bereave of life 
as when the sacred oak with thunderbolt

slide along the air celestial vault 
be rend and cleave to the very root 
in vain therefore I strangle with this foe 
then welcome death since God will have it so 

alas my lord we sorrow at your case 
and grieve to see your person vex thus 
but whatsoever the fate determine have

and he that will annihilate his mind 
soar with Icarus too near the sun 
may catch a fall with young Bellerophon 
for when the fatal sister have decree 
to separate we from this earthly mould

then worthy lord since there be no way but one 
cease your lament and leave your grievous moan

and all the crew of the molossian

and to their cost behold our chivalry 
where ere ancora handmaid of the sun 
where ere the sunbright guardian of the day 
where ere the joyful day with cheerful light 
where ere the light illuminate the word 
the trojan glory fly with golden wing 
wing that do soar beyond fell envious flight 
the fame of Brutus and his follower

of mighty jove commander of the world 
then worthy Brutus leave these sad lament 
comfort yourself with this your great renown 
and fear not death though he seem terrible 

nay Corinus you mistake my mind 
in construe wrong the cause of my complaint 
I fear to yield myself to fatal death

or with his Ixion overdare soon 
be bind in chain of ever during steel 

then harken to your sovereign late word 
in which I will unto you all unfold 
our royal mind and resolute intent 
when golden Hebe daughter to great jove 
cover my manly cheek with youthful down 
the unhappy slaughter of my luckless sire 
drive i and old Assaracus my eme 
as exile from the bound of Italy 
so that perforce we be constrain to fly 
to grecian monarch noble Pandrassus 
there I alone do undertake your cause 
there I restore your antique liberty 
though Grecia frown and all Mollossia storm 
though brave Antigonus with martial band 
in pitch field encounter i and i 
though Pandrassus and his contributory 
with all the rout of their confederate 
seek to deface our glorious memory 
and wipe the name of trojan from the earth 
he do I captivate with this my arm 
and by compulsion force he to agree 
to certain article which there we do propound 
from Graecia through the boisterous Hellespont 
we come unto the field of lestrigon 
whereas our brother corineius be 
which when we pass the Sicilian gulf 
and so transfret the illician sea 
arrive on the coast of Aquitane 
where with a army of his barbarous Gaul 
Goffarius and his brother Gathelus 
encounter with our host sustain the foil 
and for your sake my Turnus there I lose 
Turnus that slay six hundred man at arm 
all in a hour with his sharp battleaxe 
from thence upon the strons of Albion 
to Corus haven happy we come 
and quell the giant come of Albion race 
with Gogmagog son to samotheus

and for the same in dangerous attempt 
in sundry conflict and in diverse broil

a savage captain of a savage crew 
and for these deed brave Cornwall I receive 
a grateful gift give by a gracious king 
and for this gift this life and dear blood 
will Corineus spend for Brutus good

leave unto he for a inheritage 
by those that be his ancestor 
let i be fling into the ocean 
and swallow in the bowel of the earth

to contradict her age father will 
therefore since he to who I must obey 
have give i now unto your royal self 
I will not stand aloof from off the lure 
like crafty dame that most of all deny 
that which they most desire to possess 
then now my son thy part be on the stage

Locrine stand up and wear the regal crown 
and think upon the state of majesty 
that thou with honour well may wear the crown 
and if thou tender these my late word 
as thou require my soul to be at rest 
as thou desire thy own security 
cherish and love thy new betroth wife

that tame the huge monster of the world 
play thou as sweet on the sweet sound lute 
as do the spouse of fair Euridies 
that do enchant the water with his noise 
and make stone bird and beast to lead a dance 
constrain the hilly tree to follow he 
thou can not move the judge of crebus 
nor move compassion in grim Pluto heart 
for fatal mors expect all the world 
and every man must tread the way of death 
brave Tantalus the valiant Pelops sire 
guest to the god suffer untimely death 
and old fleithonus husband to the morn 
and eke grim Minos who just jupiter 
deign to admit unto his sacrifice 
the thunder trumpet of bloodthirsty Mars 
the fearful rage of fell Tisiphone

when Perseus marry fair Andromeda 
the only daughter of king Cepheus 
he think he have establish well his crown 
and that his kingdom shall for aye endure 
but lo proud Phineus with a band of man 
contrive of sunburn aethiopian 
by force of arm the bride he take from he 
and turn their joy into a flood of tear 
So fare it with young Locrine and his love 
he think this marriage tend to his weal 
but this foul day this foul accurse day 
be the beginning of his misery 
behold where Humber and his scythian 
approache nigh with all his warlike train 
I need not I the sequel shall declare 
what tragic chance fall out in this war 

at length the snail do climb the high top 
ascend up the stately castle wall 
at length the water with continual drop 
do penetrate the hard marble stone 
at length we be arrive in Albion 
nor can the barbarous dacian sovereign 
nor yet the ruler of brave Belgia 
stay we from cut over to this I will 
whereas I hear a troop of Phrygian 
under the conduct of Postumia son 
have pitch up lordly pavilion 
and hope to prosper in this lovely I will 
but I will frustrate all their foolish hope 
and teach they that the scythian emperor 
lead fortune tie in a chain of gold 
constrain she to yield unto his will 
and grace he with their regal diadem

be equal to the grove of Thessaly 
where Phoebus with the learned lady nine 
delight themselves with music harmony 
and from the moisture of the mountain top 
the silent spring dance down with murmur stream 
and water all the ground with crystal wave 
the gentle blast of Eurus modest wind 
move the pitter leaf of sylvan wood 
do equal it with Tempe paradise 
and thus comfort all to one effect 
do make i think these be the happy isle 
most fortunate if Humber may they win 

madam where resolution lead the way 
and courage follow with embolden pace 
fortune can never use her tyranny 
for valiantness be like unto a rock

and Borras fall with his tempestuous storm 
blow upon it with a hideous clamour

yet will we not start back one foot from they 
that they may know we be invincible

and the immortal god that live therein 
whenas the morning show his cheerful face 
and Lucifer mount upon his steed

I will meet young Albanact in the open field 
and crack my lance upon his burganet 
to try the valour of his boyish strength 
there will I show such ruthful spectacle 
and cause so great effusion of blood 
that all his boy shall wonder at my strength 
as when the warlike queen of Amazon 
Penthesilea arm with her lance 
gird with a corslet of bright shine steel 
coop up the faintheart grecian in the camp 

speak like a warlike knight my noble son 
nay like a prince that seek his father joy

scelera in authorem cadunt 
high on a bank by Nilus boisterous stream 
fearful sit the egyptian crocodile 
dreadful grind in her sharp long tooth 
the break bowel of a silly fish 
his back be arm against the dint of spear 
with shield of brass that shine like burnish gold 
and as he stretch forth his cruel paw 
a subtle adder creep close near 
thrust his fork sting into his claw 
privy shed his poison through his bone 
which make he swell that there his bowel burst 
that do so much in his own greatness trust 
so Humber have conquer Albanact 
do yield his glory unto Locrine sword 
mark what ensue and you may easy see 
that all our life be but a tragedy 

and be this true be albanactus slay 
have curse Humber with his straggle host 
with that his army make of mongrel cur 
bring our redoubt brother to his end 
o that I have the thracian Orpheus harp 
for to awake out of the infernal shade 
those ugly devil of black Erebus 
that may torment the damn traitor soul 
oh that I have Amphion instrument 
to quicken with his vital note and tune 
the flinty joint of every stony rock 
by which the scythian may be punish 
for by the lightning of almighty jove 
the hun shall die have he ten thousand life 
and will to God he have ten thousand life 
that I may with the armstrong Hercules 
crop off so vile a hidra hiss head 
but say i cousin for I long to hear 
how Albanact come by untimely death 

after the traitorous host of scythian 
enter the field with martial equipage 
young Albanact impatient of delay 
lead forth his army against the straggle mate 
who multitude do daunt our soldier mind 
yet nothing can dismay the forward prince 
but with a courage most heroical 
like to a lion among a flock of lamb 
make havoc of the faint heart fugitive 
hew a passage through they with his sword 
yea we have almost give they the repulse 
when sudden from out the silent wood 
hubba with twenty thousand soldier 
cowardly come upon our weaken back 
and murder all with fatal massacre 
among the which old Debon martial knight 
with many wound be bring unto the death 
and Albanact oppress with multitude 
while valiant he fell his enemy 
yield his life and honour to the dust 
he be dead the soldier flee amain 
and I alone escape they by flight 
to bring you tiding of these accident 

not age Priam king of stately Troy 
grand emperor of barbarous Asia 
when he behold his noble mind son 
slay traitorous by all the Myrmidon 
lament more than I for Albanact 

not Hecuba the queen of Ilium 
when she behold the town of Pergamus 
her palace burn with all devour flame 
her fifty son and daughter fresh of hue 
murder by wicked Pyrrhus bloody sword 
shed such sad tear as I for Albanact 

the grief of Niobe fair Athens queen 
for her seven son magnanimous in field 
for her seven daughter fair than the fair 
be not to be compare with my lament 

in vain you sorrow for the slaughter prince 
in vain you sorrow for his overthrow 
he love not most that do lament the most 
but he that seek to venge the injury 
think you to quell the enemy warlike train 
with childish sob and womanish lament 
unsheathe your sword unsheathe your conquer sword 
and seek revenge the comfort for this sore 
in Cornwall where I hold my regiment 
even just ten thousand valiant man at arm 
have Corineus ready at command 
all these and more if need shall more require 
have Corrineus ready at command 

and in the field of martial Cambria 
close by the boisterous Iscan silver stream 
where lightfoot fair skip from bank to bank 
full twenty thousand brave courageous knight 
well exercise in feat of chivalry 
in manly manner most invincible 
young Camber have with gold and victual 
all these and more if need shall more require 
I offer up to venge my brother death 

thank love uncle and good brother too 
for this revenge for this sweet word revenge 
must ease and cease thy wrongful injury 
and by the sword of bloody Mars I swear 
never shall sweet quiet enter this my front 
till I be venge on his traitorous head 
that slay my noble brother Albanact 
sound drum and trumpet muster up the camp 
for we will straight march to Albania 

thus be we come victorious conqueror 
unto the flow current silver stream 
which in memorial of our victory 
shall be agnominate by our name 
and talk of by our posterity 
for sure I hope before the golden sun 
post his horse to fair Thetis plain 
to see the water turn into blood 
and change his bluish hue to rueful red 
by reason of the fatal massacre 
which shall be make upon the virent plain 
see how the traitor do presage his harm 
see how he glory at his own decay 
see how he triumph at his proper loss 
oh fortune vild unstable fickle frail 

methinks I see both army in the field 
the break lance climb the crystal sky 
some headless lie some breathless on the ground 
and every place be straw with carcase 
behold the grass have lose his pleasant green 
the sweet sight that ever may be see 

I traitorous Humber thou shall find it so 
yea to thy cost thou shall the same behold 
with anguish sorrow and with sad lament 
the grassy plain that now do please thy eye 
shall ere the night be colour all with blood 
the shady grove which now enclose thy camp 
and yield sweet savour to thy damn corpse 
shall ere the night figure all with blood 
the profound stream that pass by thy tent 
and with his moisture serve all thy camp 
shall ere the night convert be to blood 
yea with the blood of those thy straggle boy 
for now revenge shall ease my linger grief 
and now revenge shall glut my long soul 

let come what will I mean to bear it out 
and either live with glorious victory 
or die with fame renown for chivalry 
he be not worthy of the honey comb 
that shun the hive because the bee have sting 
that like i best that be not get with ease 
which thousand danger do accompany 
for nothing can dismay our regal mind 
which aim at nothing but a golden crown 
the only upshot of my enterprise 
be they enchant in grim Pluto court 
and keep for treasure among his hellish crew 
I will either quell the triple Cerberus 
and all the army of his hateful hag 
or roll the stone with wretched Sisiphon 

right martial be thy thought my noble son 
and all thy word savour of chivalry 
but warlike Segar what strange accident 
make you to leave the ward of the camp 

to arm my lord to honourable arm 
take helm and targe in hand the Briton come 
with great multitude than erst the greek 
bring to the port of phrygian Tenidos 

but what say Segar to these accident 
what counsel give he in extremity 

why this my lord experience teach we 
that resolution be a sole help at need 
and this my lord our honour teach we 
that we be bold in every enterprise 
then since there be no way but fight or die

now sit I like the mighty god of war

thy brag banner cross with argent stream 
the ornament of thy pavilion 
shall all be captivate with this hand 
and thou thyself at albanactus tomb 
shall offer be in satisfaction 
of all the wrong thou do he when he live 
but can thou tell i brave Thrasimachus 
how far we be distant from humber camp 

my lord within your foul accurse grove 
that bear the token of our overthrow 
this Humber have entrench his damn camp 
march on my lord because I long to see 
the treacherous scythian squelter in their gore 

sweet fortune favour Locrine with a smile 
that I may venge my noble brother death 
and in the midst of stately Troynovant 
I will build a temple to thy deity 
of perfect marble and of jacinthe stone 
that it shall pass the high pyramid 
which with their top surmount the firmament 

the armestrong offspring of the doubt knight 
stout Hercules Alcmena mighty son 
that tame the monster of the threefold world 
and rid the oppress from the tyrant yoke 
do never show such valiantness in fight 
as I will now for noble Albanact 

full four score year have Corineus live 
sometime in war sometime in quiet peace 
and yet I feel myself to be as strong 
as erst I be in summer of my age 
able to toss this great unwieldy club 
which have be paint with my foeman brain 
and with this club I will break the strong array 
of Humber and his straggle soldier 
or lose my life among the thick press 
and die with honour in my late day 
yet ere I die they all shall understand 
what force lie in stout Corineus hand 

and if Thrasimachus detract the fight 
either for weakness or for cowardice 
let he not boast that Brutus be his eme 
or that brave Corineus be his sire 

then courage soldier first for your safety 
next for your peace last for your victory exeunt 

be thou that Humber prince of fugitive 
that by thy treason slay young Albanact 

I be his son that slay young Albanact 
and if thou take not heed proud phrygian 
I will send thy soul unto the stygian lake 
there to complain of humber injury 

you triumph sir before the victory 
for Corineus be not so soon slay 
but curse scythian you shall rue the day 
that ere you come into Albania 
so perish that they envy Britain wealth 
so let they die with endless infamy 
and he that seek his sovereign overthrow 
will this my club may aggravate his woe 
where may I find some desert wilderness 
where I may breathe out curse as I will 
and scare the earth with my condemn voice 
where every echo repercussion 
may help i to bewail my overthrow 
and aid i in my sorrowful lament 
where may I find some hollow uncouth rock 
where I may damn condemn and ban my fill 
the heaven the hell the earth the air the fire 
and utter curse to the concave sky 
which may infect the airy region 
and light upon the Britain Locrine head 
you ugly spirit that in Cocytus mourn 
and gnash your tooth with dolorous lament 
yea fearful dog that in black Lathe howl 
and scare the ghost with your wide open throat 
you ugly ghost that fly from these dog 
do plunge yourselves in Pyriphlegeton 
come all of you and with your shriek note 
accompany the Briton conquer host 
Come fierce Erinys horrible with snake 
come ugly fury arm with your whip 
you threefold judge of black Tartarus 
and all the army of you hellish fiend 
with new find torment rack proud Locrine bone 
oh god and star damn be the god and star 
that do not drown i in fair Thetis plain 
curse be the sea that with outrageous wave 
with surge billow do not rive my ship 
against the rock of high Cerannia 
or swallow i into her watery gulf 
will God we have arrive upon the shore 
where Polyphemus and the Cyclops dwell 
or where the bloody anthropophagy 
with greedy jaw devour the wander wight 
but why come albanact bloody ghost 
to bring a corrosive to our misery 
be it not enough to suffer shameful flight 
but we must be torment now with ghost 
with apparition fearful to behold 

revenge revenge for blood 

so nought will satisfy your wander ghost 
but dire revenge nothing but humber fall 
because he conquer you in Vlbany 
now by my soul Humber will be condemn 
to Tantal hunger or Ixion wheel 
or to the vulture of Prometheus 
rather than that this murder be undo 
whenas I die I will drag thy curse ghost 
through all the river of foul Erebus 
through burn sulphur of the Limbolake 
to allay the burn fury of that heat 
that rage in my everlasting soul 

thus from the fury of Bellona broil 
with sound of drum and trumpet melody 
the Britain king return triumphant 
the scythian slay with great occision 
do equalise the grass in multitude 
and with their blood have stain the stream brook 
offer their body and their dear blood 
as sacrifice to albanactus ghost 
now curse Humber have thou pay thy due 
for thy deceit and crafty treachery 
for all thy guise and damn stratagem 
with loss of life and ever during shame 
where be thy horse trap with burnish gold 
thy trample courser rule with foam bit 
where be thy soldier strong and numberless 
thy valiant captain and thy noble peer 
Even as the country clown with sharp scythe 
do mow the wither grass from off the earth 
or as the ploughman with his pierce share 
rent the bowel of the fertile field 
and rip up the root with razor keen 
so Locrine with his mighty curtleaxe 
have crop off the head of all thy Hun 
so Locrine peer have daunt all thy peer 
and drive thy host unto confusion 
that thou may suffer penance for thy fault 
and die for murder valiant Albanact 

and thus yea thus shall all the rest be serve 
that seek to enter Albion against our will 
if the brave nation of the troglodyte 
if all the coalblack aethiopian 
if all the force of the Amazon 
if all the host of the barbarian land 
shall dare to enter this our little world 
soon shall they rue their overbold attempt 
that after we our progeny may say 
there lie the beast that seek to usurp our land 

i they be beast that seek to usurp our land 
and like to brutish beast they shall be serve 
for mighty love the supreme king of heaven 
that guide the concourse of the meteor 
and rule the motion of the azure sky 
fight always for the Briton safety 
but stay methinks I hear some shriek noise 
that draw near to our pavilion 

what prince soever adorn with golden 
do sway the regal scepter in his hand 
and think no chance can ever throw he down 
or that his state shall everlasting stand 
let he behold poor Estrild in this plight 
the perfect platform of a trouble wight 
once be I guard with manortial band 
compass with prince of the noble blood 
now be I fall into my foeman hand 
and with my death must pacify their mood 
o life the harbour of calamity 
oh death the haven of all misery 
I can compare my sorrow to thy woe 
thou wretched queen of wretched Pergamus 
but that thou view thy enemy overthrow 
Nigh to the rock of high Caphareus 
thou see their death and then depart thence 
I must abide the victor insolence 
the god that pity thy continual grief 
transform thy corpse and with thy corpse thy care 
poor Estrild live despair of relief 
for friend in trouble be but few and rare 
what say I few I few or none at all 
for cruel death make havoc of they all 
thrice happy they who fortune be so good 
to end their life and with their life their woe 
thrice hapless I who fortune so withstand 
that cruel she give i to my foe 
o soldier be there any misery 
to be compare to fortune treachery 

Camber this same shall be the scythian queen 

so may we judge by her lament word 

so fair a dame my eye do never see 
with flood of woe she seem overwhelm to be 

o Locrine have she not a cause for to be sad 
if she have cause to weep for humber death 
and shed salt tear for her overthrow 
Locrine may well bewail his proper grief 
Locrine may move his own peculiar woe 
he be conquer die a speedy death 
and feel not long his lamentable smart 
I be conqueror live a linger life 
and feel the force of Cupid sudden stroke 
I give he cause to die a speedy death 
he leave i cause to wish a speedy death 
o that sweet face paint with nature die 
those roseal check mix with a snowy white 
that decent neck surpass ivory 
those comely breast which Venus well may spite 
be like to snare which wily fowler wrought 
wherein my yield heart be prisoner catch 
the golden tress of her dainty hair 
which shine like ruby glitter with the sun 
have so entrap poor Locrine lovesick heart 
that from the same no way it can be win 
how true be that which oft I hear declare 
one dram of joy must have a pound of care 

hard be their fall who from a golden crown 
be cast into a sea of wretchedness 

hard be their thrall who by Cupid frown 
be wrap in wave of endless carefulness 

o kingdom object to all misery 

o love the extreme of all extremity 
let he go into his chair 

my lord in ransack the scythian tent 
I find this lady and to manifest 
that earnest zeal I bear unto your grace 
I here present she to your majesty

and here present she to your majesty 

presumptuous villain will thou take my prize

unreverent villain strive you in our sight 
take they hence jailor to the dungeon 
there let they lie and try their quarrel out 
but thou fair princess be no whit dismay 
but rather joy that Locrine favour thou

king need not fear the vulgar sentence 

but lady must regard their honest name 

be it a shame to live in marriage bond 

no but to be a strumpet to a king 

if thou will yield to Locrine burn love 
thou shall be queen of fair Albania 

but Guendoline will undermine my state 

upon my honour thou shall have no harm 

then lo brave Locrine Estrild yield to thou 
and by the god who thou do invocate 
by the dead ghost of thy decease sire 
by thy right hand and by thy burn love

but where be my lady mistress Guendoline

have you not see a mighty elephant 
slay by the bite of a silly mouse 
Even so the chance of war inconstant be 

peace uncle peace and cease to talk hereof 
for he that seek by whisper this or that 
to trouble Locrine in his sweet life 
let he persuade himself to die the death

and learn to love proud humber concubine

his death will soon extinguish our complaint 

o no his death will more augment my woe

shall Locrine live that cause my father death 
shall Locrine live that now divorce you

and curse Estrild that inflame his heart

and have they pitch there their petty host 
so close unto our royal mansion

close by the bank of silver Simois 
o lovely Estrild now the chase begin 
never shall we see the stately Troynovant 
mount on the courser garnish all with pearl 
never shall we view the fair Concordia 
unless as captive we be thither bring 
shall Locrine then be take prisoner 
by such a youngling as Thrasimachus 
shall Guendolina captivate my love 
never shall my eye behold that dismal hour 
never will I view that ruthful spectacle 
for with my sword this sharp curtleaxe 
I will cut in sunder my accurse heart

help i to mourn for warlike Locrine death 
pour down your tear you watery region 
for mighty Locrine be bereave of life 
o fickle fortune oh unstable world 
what else be all thing that this globe contain 
but a confuse chaos of mishap 
wherein as in a glass we plain see 
that all our life be but as a tragedy 
since mighty king be subject to mishap 
I mighty king be subject to mishap 
since martial Locrine be bereave of life 
shall Estrild live then after Locrine death 
shall love of life bar she from Locrine sword 
o no this sword that have bereave his life 
shall now deprive i of my fleet soul 
strengthen these hand oh mighty jupiter 
that I may end my woeful misery 
Locrine I come Locrine I follow thou 

what doleful sight what ruthful spectacle 
have fortune offer to my hapless heart 
my father slay with such a fatal sword 
my mother murder by a mortal wound 
what thracian dog what barbarous Myrmidon 
will not relent at such a ruthful case 
what fierce Achilles what hard stony flint 
will not bemoan this mournful tragedy 
Locrine the map of magnanimity 
lie slaughter in this foul accurse cave 
Estrild the perfect pattern of renown 
nature sole wonder in who bewteous breast 
all heavenly grace and virtue be enshrine 
both massacre be dead within this cave 
and with they die fair Pallas and sweet love 
here lie a sword and Sabren have a heart 
this bless sword shall cut my curse heart 
and bring my soul unto my parent ghost 
that they that live and view our tragedy 
may mourn our case with mournful plaudity 
ay i my virgin hand be too too weak 
to penetrate the bulwark of my breast 
my finger use to tune the amorous lute 
be not of force to hold this steely glaive 
so I be ly to wail my parent death 
not able for to work my proper death 
ah Locrine honour for thy nobleness 
ah Estrild famous for thy constancy 
il may they fare that wrought your mortal end 

search soldier search find Locrine and his love 
find the proud strumpet humber concubine 
that I may change those her so please look 
to pale and ignominious aspect 
find i the issue of their curse love 
find i young Sabren Locrine only joy 
that I may glut my mind with lukewarm blood 
swift distil from the bastard breast 
my father ghost still haunt i for revenge 
cry revenge my overhasten death 
my brother exile and my own divorce 
banish remorse clean from my brazen heart 
all mercy from my adamantine breast 

nor do thy husband lovely Guendoline 
that wont be to guide our stayless step 
enjoy this light see where he murder lie 
by luckless lot and froward frown fate 
and by he lie his lovely paramour 
fair Estrild gore with a dismal sword 
and as it seem both murder by themselves 
clasp each other in their feeble arm 
with love zeal as if for company 
their uncontented corpse be yet content 
to pass soul Styx in Charon ferryboat 

And have proud Estrild then prevent I 
have she escape Guendoline wrath 
violent by cut off her life 
will god she have the monstrous hydra life 
that every hour she may have die a death 
worse than the swing of old Ixion wheel 
and every hour revive to die again 
as Titius bind to houseless Caucason 
do feed the substance of his own mishap 
and every day for want of food do die 
and every night do live again to die 
but stay methinks I hear some faint voice 
mournful weep for their luckless death 

you mountain nymph which in these desert reign 
cease off your hasty chase of savage beast 
prepare to see a heart oppress with care 
address your ear to hear a mournful style 
no humane strength no work can work my weal 
care in my heart so tyrant like do deal 
you dryad and lightfoot satiri 
you gracious fairy which at evening tide 
your closet leave with heavenly beauty store 
and on your shoulder spread your golden lock 
you savage bear in cave and darken den 
come wail with i the martial Locrine death 
Come mourn with i for beauteous estrild death 
ah love parent little do you know 
what sorrow Sabren suffer for your thrall 

but may this be and be it possible 
live Sabren yet to expiate my wrath 
fortune I thank thou for this courtesy 
and let i never see one prosperous hour 
if Sabren die not a reproachful death 

hard heart death that when the wretched call 
be further off and seldom heerst at all 
but in the midst of fortune good success 
uncalled come and shears our life in twain 
when will that hour that bless hour draw nigh 
when poor distress Sabren may be go 
sweet Atropos cut off my fatal thread 
what be thou death shall not poor Sabren die 

yes damsel yes Sabren shall sure die 
though all the world shall seek to save her life 
and not a common death shall Sabren die 
but after strange and grievous punishment 
short inflict upon thy bastard head 
thou shall be cast into the curse stream 
and feed the fish with thy tender flesh 

and think thou then thou cruel homicide 
that these thy deed shall be unpunished 
no traitor no the god will venge these wrong 
the fiend of hell will mark these injury 
never shall these bloodsucking masty cur 
bring wretched Sabren to her late home 
for I myself inspire of thou and thou 
mean to abridge my former destiny 
and that which Locrine sword can not perform 
this pleasant stream shall present bring to pass 

one mischief follow another neck 
who will have think so young a maid as she 
with such a courage will have seek her death 
and for because this river be the place 
where little Sabren resolute die 
Sabren for ever shall this same be call 
and as for Locrine our decease spouse 
because he be the son of mighty brute 
to who we owe our country live and good 
he shall be bury in a stately tomb 
close by his age father Brutus bone 
with such great pomp and great solemnity 
as well beseem so brave a prince as he 
let Estrild lie without the shallow fault 
without the honour due unto the dead 
because she be the author of this war 
retire brave follower unto Troynouant 
where we will celebrate these exequies 
and place young Locrine in his father tomb 

Lo here the end of lawless treachery 
of usurpation and ambitious pride 
and they that for their private amour dare 
turmoil our land and see their broil abroach 
let they be warn by these premise 
and as a woman be the only cause 
that civil discord be then stir up 
so let we pray for that renown maid 
that eight and thirty year the scepter sway 
in quiet peace and sweet felicity 
and every wight that seek her grace smart 
will that this sword be pierce in his heart Exit
