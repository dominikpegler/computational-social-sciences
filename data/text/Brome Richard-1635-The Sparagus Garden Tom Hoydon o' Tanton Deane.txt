o you be most friendly welcome good mr Gilbert Gilawire and mr Walter Chamlet I take you to be 

the same sir at your service 

your father both be my good neighbour indeed worthy and well repute member of the city while they live but that may be read upon the hospital wall and gate it be enough for i to say they love i Sanson touchwood and I be a wretch if I shall not honour their memory in their happy succession again gentleman you be welcome 

yet you may be please sir to remember though our father be both love friend to you yet they be sometime at odds one with another 

true true ever at odds they be the common talk of the town for a pair of wrangler still at strife for one trifle or other they be at law loggerhead together in one match that hold they tug tone the other by the pursestring a matter of nine year and all for a matter of nothing they course one another from court to court and through every court temporal and spiritual and hold one another play till they lose a thousand pound a man to the lawyer and till it be very sufficient and judge that your father be one fool and your father be another fool and so again gentleman you be welcome now your business 

you may now be please sir to remember that our father grow friend at last 

heaven forbid else 

and note the cause the ground of their reconciliation which be upon the love betwixt i and this gentleman sister my father son marry his father daughter and our two father grow friend and wise man again 

to the point good gentleman yet you be welcome 

troth sir the point be this you know and the town have take sufficient notice of it that there have be a long contention betwixt you and old mr Striker your neighbour 

ha 

and the cause or ground of your quarrel for aught anybody know but yourselves may be as trivial as that which be deride in our father 

be you there with i 

and great hope there be and wager lay by your friend on both side that you two will be friend 

I will hold you a hundred pound of that 

nay more that mr Striker will be willing to give his grandchild to your son so you will give your consent 

and your come be to persuade that be it not if it be so speak deal plain with i gentleman while yet you be welcome 

insooth it be so we come to negotiate the match for your son and your friendship with old mr Striker 

you be not welcome 

but when you weigh the reason and consider the perfect love of the young pair and how the world will praise your reconciliation and bless the providence that make their love the mean to work their parent charity 

again you be not welcome 

yourself but now commend the atonement 
of our two father wrought by the same mean 
I mean my marriage with his sister here 
against as great a opposition 

but our father love their child 

your father be a couple of dote fool and you a pair of saucy knave now you be not welcome and more than so get you out of my door 

will you sir by your wilfulness cast away your son 

my son no son of i I have cast he off already for cast a eye upon the daughter of my enemy let he go let he pack let he perish he come not within these door and you that be his fine speak spokesman get you off of my ground I charge you 

we be go sir only but wish you mr touchwood to remember that your son be your son 

indefinite not sir until he do not only renounce all interest in the love of that baggage but do some extraordinary mischief in that family to right i for the trespass he have do and so win my good opinion till which be do a daily curse of mine he shall not miss and so you may inform he 

what a uncharitable wretch be this 

the touchy piece of touchwood that ever I meet withal 

I fear we shall inflame he 

all the comfort be his son may yet outlive he 

but the danger be his father may disinherit he 

he can be so devilish here come his son a gentleman of so sweet a disposition and so contrary to his crabbed sire that a man who never hear of his mother virtue may wonder who get he for he 

not at all I assure you same be his father noun son for the old man you see be gentle enough till he be incense and the son be move be as fiery as the father 

but he be very seldom and slow move his father often and of the sudden 

I prithee will thou have green wood take fire as soon as that which be old and sere 

he be deep in thought 

over head and ear in his mrs contemplation 

to disobey a father be a crime 
in any son unpardonable be this rule 
so general that it can bear no exception 
or be a father power so illimitable 
as to command his son affection 
and so control the conqueror of all man 
even love himself no he that enterprise 
so great a work forget he be a man 
and must in that forget he be a father 
and so if he forgo his nature I 
by the same law may leave my piety 
but stay I will not lose myself in follow 
this wild conceit 

how now Sam whither away 

I be but cast how to find the way 
unto myself can you direct i gentleman 

yes yes your father have tell we the way 

have you have conference with he have you speak 

marry sir have we and I think to purpose 

have you win aught upon he to my advantage 

as much as may restore you to acquaintance 
with he again can you but make good use on it 

pray do not trifle with i tell i brief 

brief he say you must not dare to see he 
nor hope to receive blessing to the value 
of a new threepence till you disclaim your love 
in your fair Annabel and not only so 
but you must do some villainous mischievous act 
to vex his adversary her grandfather 
or walk beneath his curse in banishment 

a most uncharitable and unnatural sentence 

but think withal it be your father that 
make this decree obey he in the excecution 
he have a great estate you be his only son 
do not lose he your fortune and yourself 
for a frail piece of beauty shake she off 
and do some notable thing against her house 
to please your father 

the devil speak it in thou 
and with this spell I must conjure he out 

o friend you be too violent 

he be too desperate 
to urge i to a act of such injustice 
can her fair love to who my faith be give 
be answer with so loud a injury 
or can my faith so break yield a sound 
less terrible than thunder to affright 
all love and constancy out of the breast 
of every virgin that shall hear the breach 
of my firm faith 

be not so passionate 

I have no further power to do a outrage 
against that family to who my heart 
be link than to rip out this trouble heart 
the only ominous cause indeed of all 
my over passionate father cruelty and that 
if I must needs do a injurious office 
alone shall be my act to calm his fury 

prithee blow over this passion thou be wont 
to affect wit and can not be a lover 
true without it love be wit itself 
and through a thousand let will find a way 
to his desire end 

the ballet teach you that 

Well say love will find out the way 
I see thou be come to thyself again 
can there no shift no witty slight be find 
that have be common in all time and age 
to blind the eye of a weaksighted father 
and reconcile these dangerous difference 
but by bloodshedding or outrageous deed 
to make the feud the great recollect 
thyself good Sam my house my purse my counsel 
shall all be thou and what shall be thy friend 

let i entreat your friendship 

and i your pardon

Come come I know the quarrel and I know you will never get a child by fall out 

nor any way else so long as he be such a jealous beast as he be

quick sweet sir Hugh I long for that before you name it 

have you this spring eat any asparagus yet 

why be that good for a woman that long to be with child 

of all the plant herb root or fruit that grow it be the most provocative operative and effective 

Indeed sir Hugh 

all your best especial your modern herbalist conclude that your asparagus be the only sweet stirrer that the earth send forth beyond your wild carrot cornflag or gladial your root of standergrass or of Satyrion boil in goat milk be hold good your clary or Horminum in diverse way good and Dill especial boil in oil be also good but none of these nor saffron boil in wine your nut of artichoke rocket or seed of ashtree which we call the kite key nor thousand such though all be good may stand up for perfection with asparagus 

do you say so sir Hugh 

I have it from the opinion of most learned doctor rare physician and one that dare call himself so 

what doctor be he a fool on horseback

and sure it be a rare commodity when a knight be become a broker for to cry it up so 

and let i have some present for my next meal or you can imagine how sick I will be 

but mistake not i nor the commodity we speak of mrs brittleware where will you have it here in our own house fie the virtue of it be mortify if it pass the threshold from the ground it grow on no you must thither to the garden of delight where you may have it dress and eat in the due kind and there it be so provocative and so quick in the hot operation that none dare eat it but those that carry their cooler with they present to delay or take off the delightful fury it fill they with 

be there conveniency for that too 

yes yes the house afford you as convenient couch to retire to as the garden have bed for the precious plant to grow in that make the place a palace of pleasure and daily resort and fill with lord and knight and their lady gentleman and gallant with their mistress 

but do not honest man go thither with their wife too 

none other some to their own cost and some at other man
