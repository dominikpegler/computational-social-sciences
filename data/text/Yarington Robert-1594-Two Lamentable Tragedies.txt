call it a burden for it seem so great

free from the yoke of such subjection 
the boy shall die be he my father son 
before I will part with my possession 
I will call my son and ask his good advice 
how I may best dispatch this serious cause 
ho sir Allenso 

father

I must entreat your furtherance and advice 
about a thing that do concern we near 
first tell i how thou do affect in heart 
little Pertillo thy dead uncle son 

so well good father that I can tell 
whether I love he dear than myself 
and yet if that my heart be call to count 
I think it will surrender i to death 
ere young Pertillo shall sustain a wrong 

How get his safety such a deep regard 
within your heart that you affect it so 

nature give root love and the die charge 
of his dead father give such store of sap 
unto this tree of my affection 
that it will never wither till I die 

but nature love and reason tell thou thus 
thyself must yet be near to thyself 

his love do not estrange i from myself 
but do confirm my strength with multitude 
of benefit his love will yield to i 

beware to foster such pernicious snake 
within thy bosom which will poison thou 

he be a dove a child a innocent 
and can poison father though he will 

I will be plain know Pertillo life 
which thou do call a dove a innocent 
a harmless child and and I know not what 
will harm thou more than any serpent can 
ay than the very sight of basilisk 

father you tell i of a strange discourse 
how can his life produce such detriment 
as basilisk who only sight be death 

harken to i and I will tell thou how 
thou know his father good his house land 
have much advance our reputation 
in have but their usage for a time 
if the boy live then like to senseless beast 
like long ear ass and rich lade mule 
we must resign these treasure to a boy 
and we like ass feed on simple hay 
make he away they shall continue we 
by virtue of his father testament 
the jewel castle meadow house land 
which thy small cousin shall defeat thou of 
be still thy own and thou advance thyself 
above the height of all thy ancestor

justice will thrust aspire thought below 
and make i caper for to break my neck 
after some woeful lamentation 
of my obedience to unlawfulness 
I tell you plain I will not have he die 
may I enjoy the sultan empery 

what will thou bar thyself of happiness 
stop the large stream of pleasure which will flow 
and still attend on thou like servingman 
prefer the life of he that love thou not 
before thy own and my felicity 

I will rather choose to feed on carefulness 
to ditch to delve and labour for my bread 
nay rather choose to beg from door to door 
then condescend to offer violence 
to young Pertillo in his innocence 
I know you speak to sound what mighty share 
Pertillo have in my affection 

in faith I do not therefore prithee say 
will thou consent to have he make away

of adulation and unthankfulness 
ah have their die prayer no avail 
within your heart no damn extortion 
have leave no room for grace to harbour in 
audacious sin how can thou make he say 
consent to make my brother son away 

nay if you begin to brawl withdraw yourself 
but utter not the motion that I make 
as you love i or do regard your life 

and as you love my safety and your soul 
let grace and fear of God such thought control 

still prattle let your grace and fear alone 
and leave i quick to my private thought 
or with my sword I will open wide a gate 
for wrath and bloody death to enter in 

better you give i death and burial 
than such foul deed shall overthrow we all 

still be you wag that rebellious tongue 
I will dig it out for crow to feed upon 
if thou continue long in my sight Exit Alenso

in the dead bosom of the bloody boy 
and wind himself his son and harmless wife 
in endless fold of sure destruction

to shamble forth with bold audacity

why then belike you mean to do your charge 
and feel no taste of pity in your heart 

of pity man that never enter here 
and if it shall I will threat my craven heart 
to stab it home for harbour such a thought 
I see no reason why I shall relent 
it be a charitable virtuous deed 
to end this princock from this sinful world 

such charity will never have reward 
unless it be with sting of conscience 
and that be a torment worse than sisyphus 
that roll a restless stone against the hill 

my conscience be not prick with such conceit 

that show thou further off from hope grace 

grace i no grace I respect no grace 
but with a grace to give a graceless stab

only forbear to lay thy rude hand 
upon the poor mistrustless tender child 
as for our vow fear not their violence 
God will forgive on hearty penitence

of that thou never mean to execute 
pure cowardice for fear to crack thy neck

a goodly pardon for thy heinous sin

where none shall here nor see my lamentation 

and I will follow wheresoever thou go exit

that do arise upon this accident 

there be no hope he shall recover speech 
the wife do say he be ready now to leave

methinks if beech himself be innocent 
that then the murderer shall not dwell far off 
the hammer that be stick in his head 
be borrow of a cutler dwell by 
but he remember not who borrow it 
he be commit that do owe the hammer 
but yet he stand upon his innocence 
and Beech absence cause great suspicion 

if beech be faulty as I do not think 
I never be so much deceive before 
o have you know his conversation

devil seem saint and in this hateful time 
deceit can bear apparent sign of truth 
and vice bear show of virtue excellence

but who be that that bring a heavy load 
behind he on a painful porter back

which late be join to that mangle trunk 
lay they together see if they can make 
among they all a sound and solid man 

they all agree but yet they can make 
that sound and whole which a remorseless hand 
have sever with a knife of cruelty 
but say good sir where do you find this out 

walk betimes by parisgarden ditch 
have my water spaniel by my side 
when we approach unto that hapless place 
where this same trunk lie drown in a ditch 
my spaniel begin to send to bark to plunge 
into the water and come forth again 
and fawn on i as if a man shall say 
help out a man that here lie murder 
at first I take delight to see the dog 
think in vain some game do there lie hide 
among the nettle grow near the bank

Merry by law convict as principal 
receive his doom to hang till he be dead 
and afterward for to be hang in chain 
Williams and Rachel likewise be convict 
for their concealment William crave his book 
and so receive a brand of infamy 
but wretched Rachel sex deny that grace 
and therefore do receive a doom of death 
to die with he who sin she do conceal 
your eye shall witness of their shade tip 
which many here do see perform indeed 
as for Fallerio not his homely weed 
his beardless face nor counterfeit speech 
can shield he from deserve punishment 
but what he think shall rid he from suspect 
shall drench he in more wave of wretchedness 
pull his son into relentless jaw 
of hungry death on tree of infamy 
here come the duke that doom they both to die 
next Merry death shall end this tragedy Exit 

where be that Siren that incarnate fiend 
monster of nature spectacle of shame 
blot and confusion of his family 
false seem semblance of truedealing trust 
I mean Fallerio bloody murderer 
have he confess his curse treachery 
or will he stand to prove his innocence 

we have attach Fallerio gracious lord 
and do accuse he with Pertillo death 
but he remote will not confess himself 
neither the mean nor author of the same 
his mighty vow and protestation 
do almost seem to plead integrity 
but that we all do know the contrary 

I know your error strike your knowledge blind 
his seem i do so delude your mind people 

then bring he forth to answer for himself 
since he stand stout to deny the deed 
his son can witness that the die man 
accuse Fallerio for his treachery 
stand forth thou close disguise hypocrite 
and speak direct to these article 
first do thou hire two bloody murderer 
to massacre Pertillo in a wood 

I never do suborn such murderer 
but ever love Pertillo as my life 

thy son can witness to the contrary 

I have no son to testify so much 

no for his gravity be counterfeit 
pluck of his beard and you will swear it so 

have you no son do not Alenso live 

Alenso live but be no son of i 

Indeed his better part have not his source 
from thy corrupt vice affect heart 
for virtue be the mark he aim at 

I dare be swear that Sostrata will blush 
shall thou deny Alenso for thy son 

nay do she live she will not challenge i 
to be the father of that hapless son 

nay than anon you will deny yourself 
to be yourself unjust Fallerio 

I do confess myself to be myself 
but will not answer to Fallerio 

not to Fallerio this be excellent 
you be the man be call Fallerio 

he never breathe yet that call i so 
except he be deceive as you be now 

this impudence shall not excuse your fault 
you be well know to be Fallerio 
the wicked husband of dead Sostrata 
and father to the virtuous Alenso 
and even as sure as all these certainty 
thou do contrive thy little nephew death 

true for I be nor false Fallerio 
husband nor father as you do suggest 
and therefore do not hire the murderer 
which to be true acknowledge with your eye 

how now my lord this be a miracle 
to shake off thirty year so sudden 
and turn from feeble age to flourish youth 

but he my lord that wrought this miracle 
be not of power to free himself from death 
through the performance of this sudden change 

no be he the chief hope of Christendom 
he shall not live for this presumption 
use no excuse Alenso for thy life 
my doom of death shall be irrevocable 

ill fare his soul that will extenuate 
the rigor of your life confound doom 
I be prepare with all my heart to die 
for that be the end of human misery 

then thus you shall be hang immediate 
for your illusion of the magistrate 
with borrow shape of false antiquity 

thrice happy sentence which I do embrace 
with a more fervent and unfeigned zeal 
than a ambitious rule desire man 
will do a jem bedeck diadem 
which bring more watchful care and discontent 
then pomp or honour can remunerate 
when I be dead let it be say of i 
Alenso die to set his father free 

that be a freedom worse than servitude 
to cruel Turk or damn infidel 
most righteous judge I do appeal for justice 
justice on he that have deserve death 
not on Alenso he be innocent 

but I be guilty of abet he 
contrary to his majesty edict 
and therefore death be meritorious 

I be the wretch that do suborn the slave 
to murder poor Pertillo in the wood 
spare spare Alenso he be innocent 

what strange appeal be this we know thou not 
none but Fallerio be accuse hereof 

then father get you hence depart in time 
lest be know you suffer for the crime 

depart and leave thou clad in horror cloak 
and suffer death for true affection 
although my soul be guilty of more sin 
then ever sinful soul be guilty of 
yet fiend of hell will never suffer this 
I be thy father though unworthy so 
o still I see these weed do sear your eye 
I be Fallerio make no doubt of i put off 
though thus disguise in habit countenance 
only to escape the terror of the law 

and I Alenso that do succour he 
against your commandment mighty sovereign 
ponder your oath your vow as God do live 
I shall not live if I do rescue he 
I do God live and will revenge it home 
if you defer my condign punishment 

assure yourselves you both shall suffer death 
but for Fallerio he shall hang in chain 
after he be dead for he be principal 

unsavoury worm wood hemlock bitter gall 
bring no such bad unrelished sour taste 
unto the tongue as this death bode voice 
bring to the ear of poor Fallerio 
not for myself but for Alenso sake 
who I have murder by my treachery 
ah my dread lord if any little spark 
of melt pity do remain alive 
and not extinguish by my impious deed

to shun such danger as she run into 
by her misguide taciturnity

but let his body be convey hence 
to Mileend green and there be hang in chain 

see here the end of lucre and desire 
of riches get by unlawful mean 
what monstrous evil this have bring to pass 
your scarce dry eye give testimonial 
the father son the sister brother bring 
to open scandal and contemptuous death 
but here come they that wrought these deed of ruth 
as if they mean to plot new wickedness 
whether so fast you damn miscreant 
you vain deluder of the credulous 
that seek to train man to destruction 

why we will on to set more harm a float 
that I may swim in river of warm blood 
Outflowing from the side of innocent 

I will entice the greedy mind soul 
to pull the fruit from the forbid tree 
yet Tantal like he shall but glut his eye 
nor feed his body with salubrious fruit 

hence stigmatic you shall not harbour hear 
to practice execrable butchery 
myself will bring your close design to light 
and overthrow your vild conspiracy 
no heart shall entertain a murderous thought 
within the sea embrace continent 
where fair Eliza prince of piety 
do wear the peace adorn diadem 

maugre the worst I will have many heart 
that shall affect my secret whisper 
the chink of gold be such a please cry 
that all man wish to hear such harmony 
and I will place stern murder by my side 
that we may do more harm than haughty pride 

truth now farewell hereafter thou shall see 
I will vex thou more with many tragedy 

the more the pity will the heart of man 
be not so open wide to entertain 
the harmful bait of self devour sin 
but from the first unto the latter time 
it have and will be so eternal 
now it remain to have your good advice 
unto a motion of some consequence 
there be a bark that be new rig for sea 
unman unfurnished with munition 
she must encounter with a great foe 
then great Alcides slay in Lerna lake 
will you be please to man this willing bark 
with good conceit of her intention 
to store she with the thunder furniture 
of smooth smile and please plaudiat 
she shall be able to endure the shock 
of snarl Zoylus and his curse crew 
that seek to sink she in reproach wave 
and may perchance obtain a victory 
against curious carp and fawn parasite 
but if you suffer she for want of aid 
to be overwhelm by her insult foe 
o then she sink that mean to pass the flood 
with strong force to do she country good 
it rest thus whether she live or die 
she be your beadsman everlasting
