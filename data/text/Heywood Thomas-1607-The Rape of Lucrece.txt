the balm that must anoint we be his blood 

let we lave our brow then in that crimson flood

Mutius do 

Tarquin be proud

tyrannous 

true 

insufferable lofty 

thou have hit i 

and shall I tell thou what I prophesy 
or his succeed rule 

no I will do it for thou Tarquin ability will in the weal 
beget a weak unable impotence 
his strength make Rome and our dominion weak 
his soar high make we to flag our wing 
and fly close by the earth his golden feather 
be of such vastness that they spread like sail 
and so be calm we that we have not air 
able to raise our plume to taste the pleasure of our own element 

we be one heart our thought and our desire be suitable 

since he be king he bear he like a god 
his wife like Pallas or the wife of Jove 
will not be parley without sacrifice 
and homage sole due to the deity 

what have with good Lucretius 

have small speed 
I have a earnest suit unto the king 
about some business that concern the weal 
of Rome and we it will not be listen to 
he have take upon he such ambitious state 
that he abandon conference with his peer 
or if he chance to hear our tongue so much 
as but to hear their summons he despise 
the intent of all our speech our advise 
and counsel think his own judgement only 
to be approve in matter military 
and in affair domestic we be but shout 
and fellow of no part viol unstring 
our note too harsh to strike in prince ear 
great jove amend it 

whither will you my lord

and to my daughter Lucrece home breed safety 
danger beget in court a life retire

where industry be scorn let we welcome sloth 

nay good Lucretius do not leave we thus 
see here come Collatine but where be Valerius 
how do he taste these time 

not giddy like Brutus passionate 
like old Lucretius with his tear swell eye not laugh like 
nor blunt like Horatius Cocles here 
he have usurp a strange garb of humour 
distinct from these in nature every way 

how be he relish can his eye forbear 
in this strange state to shed a passionate tear 
can he forbear to laugh with Scevola 
at that which passionate weep can mend 

nay can his thought shape aught but melancholy 
to see these dangerous passage of state 
how be he temper noble Collatine 

strange he be all song he be ditty all 
note that Valerius have give up the court 
and wean himself from the king consistory 
in which his sweet harmonious tongue grow harsh 
whether it be that he be discontent 
yet will not so appear before the king 
or whether in applause of these new edict 
which so distaste the people or what cause 
I know not but now he be all musical 
unto the counsel chamber he go sing 
and while the king his wilful edict make 
in which nonce tongue be powerful save the king 
he be in a corner relish strange air 
conclusive he be from a towards hopeful gentleman 
transshape to a mere balleter none know 
whence shall proceed this transmutation 

see where he come morrow Valerius

Valer when Tarquin first in court begin 
and be approve king

that I dote on his sight 
now all be go new desire embrace 
and my desert disgrace 

upon my life he be either mad or lovesick 
o can Valerius but so late a statesman 
of who the public weal deserve so well

who voice shall thunder counsel in the ear 
of Tarquin and proud Tullia think Valerius 
what that proud woman Tullia be it will put thou 
quite out of tune 
Valer now what be love I pray thou tell 
it be the fountain and the well 
where pleasure and repentance dwell 
it be perhaps the sansing bell 
that ring all in to heaven or hell 
and this be love and this be love as I hear tell

a thing that creep and can go 
a prize that pass to and fro 
a thing for i a thing for more

Phoebus alone alone excel 

Tullia perhaps sin in our grandsire death 
and have not yet by reconcilement make 
atone with Phoebus at who shrine we kneel 
yet gentle priest let we thus far prevail 
to know if Tarquin seed shall govern Rome 
and by succession claim the royal wrath 
behold i young of the Tarquin race 
this elder Aruns both the son of Tullia 
This junius Brutus though a madman yet 
of the high blood of Tarquin 

Sextus peace tell we oh thou that shine so bright 
from who the world receive his light

when Tarquin soul from earth be free 
that noble Sextus shall succeed 
in Rome as king 

I oracle have thou lose thy tongue 

tempt he again fair priest 

if not as king let delphian Phoebus yet 
thus much resolve i who shall govern Rome 
or of we three bear great preeminence 

Sextus I will yet sacred Phoebus we entreat 
which of these three shall be great 
which large power and state replete 
by the heaven doom 
Phoebus thy thought no long smother

the blood of the slaughter sacrifice make this floor as slippery as the place where Tarquin tread it be glassy and as smooth as ice I be proud to hear the oracle so gracious to the blood of the Tarquin and so I fall 

nothing but so then to the oracle 
I charge thou Aruns junus Brutus thou 
to keep the sacred doom of the oracle 
from all our train lest when the young lad 
our brother now at home sit dandle 
upon fair Tullia lap this understanding 
may kiss our beauteous mother and succeed

be deaf unto our counsel 

further yet 

now Tullia what must be conclude next 

the kingdom you have get by policy 
you must maintain by pride 

good Tullia 

those that be late of the king faction 
cut off for fear they prove rebellious 

better 

since you gain nothing by the popular love 
maintain by fear your princedom 

excellent thou be our oracle and save from thou 
we will admit no counsel we obtain 
our state by cunning it must be keep by strength 
and such as can love we will teach to fear 
to encourage which upon a better judgement 
and to strike great terror to the world

by love abroad shall purchase fear at home 

we be secure then yet our great strength 
be in our child how dare treason look 
we in the face have issue barren prince 
breed danger in their singularity 
have none to succeed their claim die with they 
but when in top on three Tarquin more 
like Hydra head grow to revenge his death 
it terrify black treason 

Tullia wise and apprehensive be our princely son 
Sextus and Aruns back return safe 
with a applausive answer of the god 
from the oracle our state be able then 
be god ourselves to scorn the hate of man 

where be Tullia

Aruns shall down be Aruns twice my brother 
if he presume fore i to kiss my mother 

i Sextus think this kiss to be a crown thus will we tug for it 

Aruns thou must down

Curb in the proud boy fury let we know 
from whence this discord rise 

from our love how happy be we in our issue now 
whenas our son even with their blood contend 
to exceed in duty we accept your zeal 
this your superlative degree of kindness 
so much prevail with we that to the king 
we engage our own dear love betwixt his incensement 
and your presumption you be pardon both 
and Sextus though you fail in your first proffer 
we do not yet esteem you lest in love ascend and touch our lip 

thank you no

Aruns on earth we have no foe but you 

what mean this their unnatural enmity 

hate bear from love 

resolve we then how do the god accept 
or sacrifice how be they please with we 
how long will they applaud our sovereignty 

shall I tell the king 

do cousin with the process of your journey 

I will we go from hither when we go from here arrive thither when we land there make a end of our prayer when we have do our orison when thus quoth Phoebus Tarquin shall be happy while he be bless govern while he reign wake when he sleep not sleep when he wake not quaff when he drink eat when he feed gape when his mouth open live till he die and die when he can live no long so Phoebus commend he to you 

mad Brutus still son Aruns what say you 

that the great god to who the potent king 
of this large empire sacrifice by we 
applaud your reign commend your sovereignty 
and by a general synod grant to Tarquin 
long day fair hope majestic government 

add withal that to depose the late king which in 
other have be arch treason in Tarquin be honour what in 
Brutus have be usurpation in Tarquin be lawful succession 
and for Tullia though it be parricide for a child to kill her father 
in Tullia it be charity by death 
to rid he of all his calamity Phoebus himself say she be a good child and shall not I say as he say to tread upon her father skull sparkle his brain upon her chariot wheel 
and wear the sacred tincture of his blood 
upon the servile shoe but more than this 
after his death deny he the due claim 
of all mortality a funeral 
a earthen sepulchre this this quoth the oracle 
save Tullia none will do 

Brutus no more lest with our surpass eye of wrath and fury 
we look into the humour be not madness 
and folly to thy word a privilege 
even in thy last reproof of our proceed 
thou have pronounce thy death 

if Tullia will send Brutus abroad for news and after at his return not endure the tell of it let Tullia either get close ear or get for Brutus a strict tongue God boy 

alas it be madness pardon he not spleen 
nor be it hate but frenzy we be please 
to hear the god propitious at our prayer 
but whither be Sextus go resolve we Cocles 
we see thou in his part follow he 

I hear he say he will straight take his horse 
unto the warlike Gabine enemy 

to Rome and you save they we have no opposite 
And dare the boy confederate with our foe 
attend we lord we must new battle wage 
and with bright arm confront the proud boy rage 

have I as many soul as drop of blood 
in this branch vein as many life as star 
stick in yond azure roof and be to die 
more death than I see waste weary minute 
to grow to this I will hazard all and more 
to purchase freedom to this bondage Rome

you be our royal brother and in you

we will entreat Valerius 

since you will needs enforce a highgerman health look well to your head for I come upon you with this dutch tassaker if you be of a more noble science than you be it will go near to break your head round

gramercy Valerius come this highgerman health as double as his double double ruff I will pledge it 

be it in lubeckes or double double beer their own natural liquor I will pledge it be it as deep as his ruff let the health go round about the board as his band go round about his neck I be no more afraid of this dutch falchion than I shall be of the heathenish invention 

I must entreat you spare i for my brain brook not the fume of wine their vaporous strength offend i much 

I will have none spare i for I will spare none Collatine will pledge no health unless it be to his Lucrece 

what be Lucrece but a woman and what be woman 
but torture and disturbance unto man 
if they be foul they be odious and if fair 
they be like rich vessel full of poisonous drug 
or like black serpent arm with golden scale 
for my own part they shall not trouble i 

Sextus sit fast for I proclaim myself a woman champion and shall unhorse thou else 

for my own part I be a marry man and I will speak to my wife to thank thou Brutus 

I have a wife too and I think the most virtuous lady in the world 

I can say but that I have a good wife too and I love she but if she be in heaven beshrew i if I will wish she so much hurt as to desire her company upon earth again yet upon my honour though she be not very fair she be exceed honest 

nay the less beauty the less temptation to despoil her honesty 

I shall be angry with he that shall make question of her honour 

and I angry with thou if thou shall not maintain her honour 

if you compare the virtue of your wife let i step in for i 

I shall wrong my Lucrece not to stand for she 

ha ha all captain and stand upon the honesty of your 
wife be it possible think you that woman of young spirit and full age 
of fluent wit that can both sing and dance 
read write such as feed well and taste choice cate 
that straight dissolve to purity of blood 
that keep the vein full and inflame the appetite 
make the spirit able strong and prone 
can such as these their husband be away 
employ in foreign siege or elsewhere 
deny such as importune they at home 
tell i that flax will not be touch with fire 
nor they be win to what they most desire 

shall I end this controversy in a word 

do good Brutus 

I hold some holy but some apt to fin 
some tractable but some that none can win 
such as be virtuous gold nor wealth can move 
some vicious of themselves be prone to love 
some grape be sweet and in the garden grow 
other unpruned turn wild neglect so 
the pure oar contain both gold and dross 
the one all gain the other nought but loss 
the one disgrace reproach and scandal taint 
the other angel and sweet feature saint 

such be my virtuous Lucrece 

yet for her virtue not comparable to the wife of Aruns 

and why may not my be rank with the most virtuous 

I will put in for a lot but 1000 to one I shall draw but a blank 

I shall not show I love my wife not to take her part in her absence I hold her inferior to none 

save i 

no not to she 

o this be a brave controversy for a jury of woman to arbitrate 

I will hazard all my fortune on the virtue 
of divine Lucrece shall we try they thus 
it be now dead of night let we mount our steed 
within this two hour we may reach to Rome 
and to our house all come unprepared 
and unexpected by our high praise wine 
she of they all that we find best employ 
devote and most huswife exercise 
let she be hold most virtuous and her husband 
win by the wager a good horse and armour 

a hand on that 

here be a help hand to that bargain 

but shall we to horse without circumstance 

Scevola will be mount with the first 

then mount clevall Brutus this night take you the charge of the army I will see the trial of this wager it will do i good to see some of they find their wife in the arm of their lover they be so confident in their virtue Brutus we will interchange good night within be thou but as provident over the army as we if our horse fail not expeditious in our journey horse horse horse 

but one hour more and you shall all to rest 
now that your lord be absent from this house 
and that the master eye be from his charge 
we must be careful and with providence 
guide his domestic business we have now 
give over all feast and lewd revel 
which ill become the house who lo be absent 
we banish all excess till his return 
in fear of who my soul do daily mourn 

madam so please you to repose yourself 
within your chamber leave we to our task

to please a love husband I will offend 
the love and patience of my dear friend 
methinks his purpose be unreasonable 
to draw i in my husband absence forth 
to feast and banquet it will have ill become i 
to have leave the charge of such a spacious house without both L and mistress 
I be opinion thus wife shall not stray 
out of their door their husband be away L Turnus shall excuse i 

pray madam set i right into my work 
be abroad I may forget the charge 

impose i by my L or be compel 
to stay out late which be my husband here 
may be without distaste but he from hence 
which late a broad there can no excuse dispense 
here take your work again a while proceed 
and then to bed for while you sow I will read 

I will have hazard all my hope my wife have not be so late a revel 

nor i at this time of night a gambol 

they wear so much cork under their heel they can choose but love to caper 

nothing do i good but that if my wife be watch all they be wanton and if I halost none can brag of their win 

now Collatine to you either Lucrece must be better employ then the rest or you content to have her virtue rank with the rest 

I be please 

soft soft let we steal upon she as upon the rest lest have some watchword at our arrival we may give her notice to be better prepare nay by your leave Collatine we will limit you no advantage 

see lord thus Lucrece revel with her maid in stead of riot quaff and the practice of high lavolta to the ravish sound of chamber music she like a good huswife be teach of her husband sundry chare Lucrece 

my L and husband welcome 10 time welcome 
be it to see your Lucrece you thus late

of a poor wife in the absence of her husband 
we prostrate to you howsoever mean

we neither feast dance quaff riot nor play 

if one woman among so many bad may be find good if a white wench may prove a black swan it be Lucrece her beauty have relation to her virtue and her virtue correspondence to her beauty and in both she be fellowless 

lord will you yield the wager 

stay the wager be as well which of our wife be fair too it stretch aswell to their beauty as to their continence who shall judge that 

that can none of we because we be all party let prince Sextus determine it who have be with we and be a eye witness of their beauty 

agree 

I be please with the censure of P Sextus 

so be we all 

I commit my Lucrece whole to the censure of Sextus 

and Sextus commit he whole to the dispose of Lucr 
I love the lady and her grace desire 
nor can my love wrong what my thought admire

of any roman lady to carouse 
and drown her virtue in the juice of grape 
how can I show my love to my husband 
to do his wife such wrong by too much wine 
I may neglect the charge of this great house
