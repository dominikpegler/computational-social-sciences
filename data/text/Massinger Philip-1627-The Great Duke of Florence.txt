you bring your welcome with you 

sir I find it 
in every circumstance 

again most welcome 
yet give i leave to wish and pray you excuse i 
for I must use the freedom I be bear with 
the great duke pleasure have command you 
to my poor house upon some other service 
not this you be design to but his will 
must be obey however it ravish from i 
the happy conversation of one 
as dear to i as the old roman hold 
their household lar who they believe have power 
to bless and guard their family 

it be receive so 
on my part signior nor can the duke 
but promise to himself as much as may 
be hope for from a nephew and it be weakness 
in any man to doubt that Giovanni 
train up by your experience and care 
in all those art peculiar and proper 
to future greatness of necessity 
must in his action be grow a man 
make good the princely education 
which he derive from you 

I have discharge 
to the utmost of my power the trust the duke 
commit to i and with joy perceive 
the seed of my endeavour be not sow 
upon the barren sand but fruitful glebe 
which yield a large increase my noble charge 
by his sharp wit and pregnant apprehension 
instruct those that teach he make use 
not in a vulgar and pedantic form 
of what be read to he but it be straight digest 
and true make his own his grave discourse 
in one not more indebt unto year 
amaze such as hear he horsemanship 
and skill to use his weapon be by practice 
familiar to he as for knowledge in 
music he need it not it be bear with he 
all that he speak be with such grace deliver 
that it make perfect harmony 

you describe 
a wonder to i 

sir he be no less 
and that there may be nothing want that 
may render he complete the sweetness of 
his disposition so win on all 
appoint to attend he that they be 
rival even in the course office who 
shall get precedency to do he service 
which they esteem a great happiness 
than if they have be fashion and build up 
to hold command over other 

and what place 
do he now bless with his presence 

he be now 
run at the ring at which he be excellent 
he do allot for every exercise 
a several hour for sloth the nurse of vice 
and rust of action be a stranger to he 
but I fear I be tedious let we pass 
if you please to some other subject though I can 
deliver he as he deserve 

you have give he 
a noble character 

and how I pray you 
for we that never look beyond our villa 
must be inquisitive be state affair 
carry in court 

there be little alteration 
some rise and other fall as it stand with 
the pleasure of the duke their great disposer 

do Lodovica Sanazarro hold 
weight and grace with he 

Every day new honour 
be shower upon he and without the envy 
of such as be good man since all confess 
the service do our master in his war 
against Pisa and Sienna may with justice 
claim what be confer upon he 

it be say noble 
for prince never more make know their wisdom 
then when they cherish goodness where they find it 
they be man and not god Contarino 
they can give wealth and title but no virtue 
that be without their power when they advance 
not out of judgement but deceive fancy 
a undeserving man however set of 
with all the trim of greatness state and power 
and of a creature even grow terrible 
to he from who he take his giant form 
this thing be still a comet no true star 
and when the bounty feed his false fire 
begin to fail will of itself go out 
and what be dreadful prove ridiculous 
but in our Sanazarro it be not so 
he be pure and try gold and any stamp 
of grace to make he currant to the world 
the duke be please to give he will add honour 
to the great bestower for he though allow 
companion to his master still preserve 
his majesty in full lustre 

he indeed 
at no part do take from it but become 
a partner of his care and ease he 
with willing shoulder of a burden which 
he shall alone sustain 

be he yet marry 

no signior still a bachelor however 
it be apparent that the choice virgin 
for beauty bravery and wealth in Florence 
will with her parent glad consent be win 
be his affection and intent but know 
to be at his devotion 

so I think too 
but break we off here come my princely charge 
make your approach bold you will find 
a courteous entertainment 

pray you forbear 
my hand good signior it be a ceremony 
not due to i it be fit we shall embrace

or will believe from i how many sleep 
good Charomonte have break in his care 
to build i up a man you must confess 
Chiron the tutor to the great Achilles 
compare with he deserve not to be name 
and if my gracious uncle the great duke 
still hold i worthy his consideration

and so from i report he 

fame already 
have fill his highness ear with the true story 
of what you be and how much better by he 
and it be his purpose to reward the travail 
of this grave sir with a magnificent hand 
for though his tenderness hardly can consent 
to have you one hour absent from his sight 
for full three year he do deny himself 
the pleasure he take in you that you here 
from this great master may arrive unto 
the theory of those high mystery 
which you by action must make plain in court

and fortune do depend nor must I check 
at his command for any private motive

opinion of courtlady and take care 
of your own stake 

for my stake it be past care

but bring he thither mark i that and feed he 
but a month or two with custard and court cakebread 
and he turn knave immediate I will be honest

and not as now with other I may still 
and without observation or envy 
as I have do continue my delight 
with you that be alone in my esteem 
the abstract of society we may walk 
in solitary grove or in choice garden 
from the variety of curious flower 
contemplate nature workmanship and wonder 
and then for change near to the murmur of 
some bubble fountain I may hear you sing 
and from the welltuned accent of your tongue 
in my imagination conceive 
with what melodious harmony a choir 
of angel sing above their maker praise 
and then with chaste discourse as we return 
imp feather to the break wing of time 
and all this I must part from 

you forget 
the have impose upon we 

one word more 
and then I come and after this when with 
continue innocence of love and service 
I have grow ripe for hymeneal joy 
embrace you but with a lawful flame

for any second marriage now whereas 
you name the heir of Urbin as a princess 
of great revenue it be confess she be so 
but for some cause private to ourself 
we have dispose she otherwise yet despair not 
for you ere long with joy shall understand 
that in our princely care we have provide 
one worthy to succeed we

and hold the counsel of great Cozimo 
oraculous 

my Sanazarro nay

and promise in your clear aspect some novel 
that may delight we

a enemy to brave and thrive action 
that dare believe but in a thought we be 
too prodigal in our favour to this man 
who merit though with he we shall divide 
our dukedom still continuous his debtor 

it be far from i 

we all applaud it 

nay blush not Sanazarro we be proud 
of what we build up in thou nor can our 
election be disparage since we have not 
receive into our bosom and our grace 
a glorious lazy drone grow fat with feed 
on other toil but a industrious bee 
that crop the sweet flower of our enemy 
and every happy evening return 
load with wax and honey to our hive 

my best endeavour never can discharge

but shine upon you ever 

Contarino 

my gracious lord 

what entertainment find you 
from Carolo de Charomonte 

free 
and bountiful he be ever like himself 
noble and hospitable 

but do my nephew 
depart thence willing 

he obey your summons 
as do become he yet it be apparent 
but that he dare not cross your will he will 
have sojourn long there he ever find 
variety of sweet entertainment 
but there be something else nor can I blame 
his youth though with some trouble he take leave 
of such a sweet companion 

who be it 

the daughter sir of signior Carolo 
fair Lydia a virgin at all part 
but in her birth and fortune equal to he 
the rare beauty Italy can make boast of 
be but mere shadow to she she the substance 
of all perfection and what increase 
the wonder sir her body matchless form 
be better by the pureness of her soul 
such sweet discourse such ravish behaviour 
such charm language such enchant manner 
with a simplicity that shame all courtship 
flow hourly from she that I do believe 
have Circe or Calypso her sweet grace 
wander Ulysses never have remember 
Penelope or Ithaca 

be not rape so 

your excellence will be so have you see she 

take up take up but do your observation 
note any passage of affection 
between she and my nephew 

how it shall 
be otherwise between they be beyond 
my best imagination Cupid arrow 
be useless there for of necessity 
their year and disposition do accord so 
they must wound one another 

umh thou be 
my secretary Contarino and more skill 
in politic design of state then in 
thy judgement of a beauty give i leave 
in this to doubt it here go to my cabinet 
you shall find there letter new receive touch the state of Urbin 
pray you with care peruse they leave the search 
of this to we 

I do obey in all thing 

Lydia a diamond so long conceal 
and never wear in court of such sweet feature 
and he on who I fix my dukedom hope 
make captive to it umh it be somewhat strange 
our eye be everywhere and we will make 
a strict enquiry Sanazarro 

sir 

be my nephew at his rest 

I see he in bed sir 

it be well and do the prince Fiorinda 
nay do not blush she be rich Urbin heir 
continue constant in her favour to you 

dread sir she may dispense they as she please 
but I look up to she as on a princess 
I dare not be ambitious of and hope 
her prodigal grace shall not render i 
offend to your highness 

not a scruple 
he who I favour as I do my friend 
may take all lawful grace that become he 
but touch this hereafter I have now 
and though perhaps it may appear or trifle 
serious employment for thou 

I stand ready 
for any act you please 

I know it friend 
have you never hear of Lydia the daughter 
of Carolo Charomonte 

he I know sir 
for a noble gentleman and my worthy friend 
but never hear of she 

she be deliver 
and feel to we by Contarino 
for a masterpiece in nature I will have you 
ride sudden thither to behold this wonder 
but not as send by we that be our first caution 
the second be and careful observe it 
that though you be a bachelor and endow with 
all those perfection that may take a virgin 
on forfeit of our favour do not tempt she 
it may be her fair grace do concern we 
pretend what business you think fit to gain 
access into her father house and there 
make full discovery of she and return i 
a true relation I have some end in it 
with which we will acquaint you 

this be sir 
a easy task 

yet one that must exact 
your secrecy and diligence let not 
your stay be long 

it shall not sir 

farewell

how do this dress show 

it be of itself 
curious and rare but borrow ornament

incomparable 

thou flatter i 

I can 
your excellence be above it 

Were we less perfect 
yet be as we be a absolute princess 
we of necessity must be chaste wise fair 
by our prerogative yet all these fail 
to move where I will have they How receive 
count Sanazarro the rich scarf I send he 
for his last visit 

with much reverence 
I dare not say affection he express 
more ceremony in his humble thank 
then feel of the favour and appear 
wilful ignorant in my opinion 
of what it do invite he to 

no matter 
he be blind with too much light have you not hear 
of any private mistress he be engage to 

not any and this do amaze i madam 
that he a soldier one that drink rich wine 
feed high and promise as much as Venus 
can wish to find from Mars shall in his manner 
be so averse to woman 

troth I know not 
he be man enough and if he have a haunt 
he prey far off like a subtle fox 

and that way 
I do suspect he for I learn last night 
when the great duke go to rest attend by 
one private follower he take horse but whither 
he be rid or to what end I can guess at 
but I will find it out

be my lord stir 

no he be fast 

let we take then 
our morning draught such as eat store of beef 
mutton and capon may preserve their health 
with that thin composition call small beer 
as it be say they do in England but Italian 
that think when they have sup upon a olive 
a root or bunch of raisin it be a feast 
must kill those crudity rise from cold herb 
with hot and lusty wine 

a happiness 
those Tramontane never taste 

have they not 
store of wine there 

yes and drink more in two hour 
then the Dutchman or the Dane in four and twenty 

but what be it French trash make of rot grape 
and dregs and lees of Spain with welsh metheglin 
a drench to kill a horse but this pure nectar 
be proper to our climate be too fine 
to brook the roughness of the sea the spirit 
of this beget in we quick apprehension 
and active execution whereas their 
gross feed make their understanding like it 
they can fight and that be their all 

security 
dwell about this house I think the gate be wide open 
and not a servant stir see the horse 
set up and clothe 

I shall sir 

I will make bold 
to press a little further 

who be this 
count Sanazarro 

yes I know he quick 
remove the flagon 

a good day to you friend 
nay do not conceal your physic I approve it 
and if you please will be a patient with you 

my noble lord 

a health to you well do 
I see you love yourselves and I commend you 
it be the best wisdom 

may it please your honour 
to walk a turn in the gallery I will acquaint 
my lord with your be here 

tell he I come 
for a visit only it be a handsome pile this 

why here be a brave fellow and a right one 
nor wealth nor greatness make he proud 

there be too few of they for most of our new courtier 
who father be familiar with the price 
of oil and corn with when and to where to vent they 
and leave their heir rich from their knowledge that way 
like gourd shoot up disdain a night disclaim to speak 
but to clothe of tissue 

stand you prate knave 
when such a guest be under my roof see all 
the room perfume this be the man that carry 
the sway and swinge of the court and I have rather 
preserve he i with honest office then 
but I will make no comparison bid my daughter 
trim herself up to the height I know this courtier 
must have a smack at she and perhaps by his place 
expect to wriggle further if he do 
I shall deceive his hope for I will not taint 
my honour for the dukedom which way go he 

to the round gallery 

I will entertain he 
as fit his worth and quality but no far 

I can apprehend yet I have argue 
all way I can imagine for what reason 
the great duke do employ i hither and 
what do increase the miracle I must render 
a strict and true account at my return 
of Lydia this lord daughter and describe 
in what she be excellent and where defective 
it be a hard task he that will undergo 
to make a judgement of a woman beauty 
and see through all her plaster and painting 
have need of Lynceus eye and with more ease 
may look like he through nine mud wall then make 
a true discovery of she but the intent 
and secret of my prince heart must be 
serve and not search into 

most noble sir 
excuse my age subject to ease and sloth 
that with no great speed I have present 
my service with your welcome 

it be more fit 
that I shall ask your pardon for disturb 
your restat this unseasonable hour 
but my occasion carry i so near 
your hospitable house my stay be short to 
your goodness and the name of friend which you 
be please to grace i with give i assurance 
a visit will not offend 

offend my lord 
I feel myself much young for the favour 
how be it with our gracious master 

he sir 
hold still his wont greatness and confess 
himself your debtor for your love and care 
to the prince Giovanni and have send 
particular thank by i have his grace know 
the quick dispatch of what I be design to 
will have licence i to see you 

I be rich 
in his acknowledgement 

sir I have hear 
your happiness in a daughter 

sit the wind there 

fame give she out for a rare masterpiece 

it be a plain village girl sir but obedient 
that be her best beauty sir 

let my desire 
to see she find a fair construction from you 
I bring no loose thought with i 

you be that way 
my lord free from suspicion her own manner 
without a imposition from i 
I hope will prompt she to it as she be 
she be come to make a tender of that service 
which she stand bind to pay 

with your fair leave 
I make bold to salute you 

sir ay you have it 

I be her gentlewoman will he not kiss i to 
this be course i'faith 

how he fall off 

my lord though silence best become a maid 
and to be curious to know but what concern myself and with become distance 
may argue i of boldness I must borrow 
so much of modesty as to inquire prince Giovanni health 

he can want what you be please to wish he 

will it be so 
and then there be no blessing that can make 
a hopeful and a noble prince complete 
but shall fall on he o he be our north star 
the light and pleasure of our eye 

where be I 
I feel myself another thing can charm 
be write on such pure ruby her lip melt 
assoon as touch not those smooth gale that glide 
over happy Arabia or rich Sabaea 
create in their passage gum and spice 
can serve for a weak simile to express 
the sweetness of her breath such a brave stature 
Homer bestow on Pallas every limb 
proportion to it 

this be strange my lord 

I crave your pardon and you matchless maid 
for such I must report you 

there be no notice 
take all this while of i 

and I must add 
if your discourse and reason parallel 
the rareness of your more than humane form 
you be a wonder 

pray you my lord make trial 
she can speak I can assure you and that my presence 
may not take from her freedom I will leave you 
for know my lord my confidence dare trust she 
where and with who she please if he be 
take the right way with she I can fancy 
a better match and for false play I know 
the trick and can discern they Petronella 

yes my good lord 

I have employment for you 

what be your will sir 

madam you be so large a theme to treat of 
and every grace about you offer to i 
such copiousness of language that I stand 
doubtful which first to touch at if I err 
as in my choice I may let i entreat you 
before I do offend to sign my pardon 
let this the emblem of your innocence 
give i assurance 

my hand join to you 
without this superstition confirm it 
nor need I fear you will dwell long upon i 
the barrenness of the subject yield nothing 
that rhetoric with all her trope and figure 
can amplify yet since you be resolve 
to prove yourself a courtier in my praise 
as I be a woman and you man affirm 
our sex love to be flatter I will endure it 
now when you please begin 

such Leda pap be 
down pillow style by Jove and their pure whiteness 
shame the swan down or snow no heat of lust 
swell up her azure vein and yet I feel 
that this chaste ice but touch fan fire in i 

you need not noble sir be thus transport 
or trouble your invention to express 
your thought of i the plain phrase and language 
that you can use will be too high a strain 
for such a humble theme 

if the great duke 
make this his end to try my constant temper 
though I be vanquish it be his fault not i 
for I be flesh and blood and have affection 
like other man who can behold the temple 
or holy altar but the object work 
devotion in he and I may as well 
walk over burn iron with bare foot 
and be unscorched as look upon this beauty 
without desire and that desire pursue to 
till it be quench with the enjoy those 
delight which to achieve danger be nothing 
and loyalty but a word 

I never be proud 
nor can find I be guilty of a thought 
deserve this neglect and strangeness from you 
nor be I amorous 

suppose his greatness 
love she himself why make he choice of i 
to be his agent it be tyranny 
to call one pinch with hunger to a feast 
and at that instant cruel deny he 
to taste of what he see allegiance 
tempt too far be like the trial of 
a good sword on a anvil as that often 
fly in piece without service to the owner 
so trust enforce too far prove treachery 
and be too late repent 

pray you sir 
or licence i to leave you or deliver 
the reason which invite you to command 
my tedious wait on you 

as I live 
I know not what to think on it be it he pride 
or his simplicity 

whither have my thought 
carry i from myself in this my dulness 
I have lose a opportunity 

it be true 
I be not breed in court not live a star there 
nor shine in rich embroidery and pearl 
as they that be the mistress of great fortune 
be every day adorn with 

will you vouchsafe 
your ear sweet lady 

yet I may be bold 
for my integrity and fame to rank 
with such as be more glorious though I never 
do injury yet I be sensible 
when I be contemn and scorn 

will you please to hear i 

o the difference of nature Giovanni 
a prince in expectation when he live here 
steal courtesy from heaven and will not to 
the mean servant in my father house 
have keep such distance 

pray you do not think i 
unworthy of your ear it be your beauty 
that turn i statue I can speak fair lady 

and I can hear the harshness of your courtship 
can corrupt my courtesy 

will you hear i 
if I speak of love 

provide you be modest 
I be uncivil else 

they be come to parley 
I must observe this near 

you be a rare one 
and such but that my haste command i hence 
I can converse with ever will you grace i 
with leave to visit you again 

so you 
at your return to court do i the favour 
to make a tender of my humble service 
to the prince Giovanni 

ever touch 
upon that string and will you give i hope 
of future happiness 

that as I shall find you 
the fort that be yield at the first assault 
be hardly worth the take 

o they be at it 

she be a magazine of all perfection 
and it be death to part from she yet I must 
a part kiss fair maid 

that custom grant you 

a homely breakfast do attend your lordship 
such as the place afford 

no I have feast 
already here my thank and so I leave you 
I will see you again till this unhappy hour 
I be never lose and what to do or say 
I have not yet determine 

go so abrupt 
it be very strange 

under your favour sir 
his come hither be to little purpose 
for any thing I hear from he 

take heed Lydia 
I do advise you with a father love 
and tenderness of your honour as I will not 
have you course and harsh in give entertainment 
so by no mean be credulous for great man 
till they have gain their end be giant in 
their promise but those obtain weak pigmy 
in their performance and it be a maxim 
aloud among they so they may deceive 
they may swear any thing for the queen of love 
as they hold constant do never punish 
but smile at lover perjury yet be wise too 
and when you be sue to in a noble way 
be neither nice nor scrupulous 

all you speak sir 
I hear as oracle nor will digress 
from your direction 

so shall you keep 
your fame untainted 

as I will my life sir 

leave the horse with my groom but be you careful 
with your best diligence and speed to find out 
the prince and humble in my name entreat he 
I may exchange some private conference with he 
before the great duke know of my arrival 

I haste my lord 

here I will attend his come 
and see you keep yourself as much as may be 
conceal from all man else 

to serve your lordship 
I wish I be invisible 

I be drive 
into a desperate straight and can steer 
a middle course and of the two extreme 
which I must make election of I know not 
which be more full of horror never servant 
stand more engage to a magnificent master 
than I to Cozimo and all those honour 
and glory by his grace confer upon i 
or by my prosperous service deserve 
if now I shall deceive his trust and make 
a shipwreck of my loyalty be ruine 
and on the other side if I discover 
Lydia divine perfection all my hope 
in she be sink never to be buoy up 
for it be impossible but assoon as see 
she must with adoration be sue to 
a hermit at his bead but look on she 
or the cold cynic who corinthian Lais 
not move with her lust blandishment call a stone 
at this object will take fire nor be the duke 
such a Hippolytus but that this Phaedra 
but see must force he to forsake the grove 
and Diane huntsmanship proud to serve under 
Venus soft ensign no there be no way 
for i to hope fruition of my end 
but to conceal her beauty and how that 
may be effect be as hard a task 
as with a veil to cover the sun beam 
or comfortable light three year the prince 
live in her company and Contarino 
the secretary have possess the duke 
what a rare piece she be but he be my creature 
and may with ease be fright to deny 
what he have say and if my long experience 
with some strong reason I have think upon 
can overreach a youth my practice yield i 
but little profit 

you be well return sir 

leave we when that your grace shall know the motive 
that force i to invite you to this trouble 
you will excuse my manner 

sir there need not 
this circumstance between we you be ever 
my noble friend 

you shall have further cause 
to assure you of my faith and zeal to serve you 
and when I have commit to your trust 
presume still on your retentive silence 
a secret of no less importance than 
my honour nay my head it will confirm 
what value you hold with i 

pray you believe sir 
what you deliver to i shall be lock up 
in a strong cabinet of which you yourself 
shall keep the key for here I pawn my honour 
which be the best security I can give yet 
it shall not be discover 

this assurance 
be more than I with modesty can demand 
from such a paymaster but I must be sudden 
and therefore to the purpose can your excellence 
in your imagination conceive 
on what design or whither the duke will 
command i hence last night 

no I assure you 
and it have be a rudeness to inquire 
of that I be not call to 

grant i hear 
and I will make you true understand 
it only do concern you 

i my lord 

you in your present state and future fortune 
for both lie at the stake 

you much amaze i 
pray you resolve this riddle 

you know the duke 
if he die issueless as yet he be 
determine you his heir 

it have please his highness 
oft to profess so much 

but say he shall 
be win to prove a second wife on who 
he may beget a son how in a moment 
will all those glorious expectation which 
render you reverence and remarkable 
be in a moment blast however you be 
his much love sister son 

I must bear it 
with patience and in i it be a duty 
that I be bear with and it be much unfit 
for the receiver of a benefit 
to offer for his own end to prescribe 
law to the giver pleasure 

sweet answer 
and like your noble self this your rare temper 
so win upon i that I will not live 
if that by honest art I can prevent it 
to see your hope make frustrate and but think 
how you shall be transform from what you be 
shall this as heaven avert it ever happen 
it must disturb your peace for whereas now 
be as you be receive for the heir apparent 
you be no soon see but wonder at 
the signior make it a business to 
inquire how you have sleep and as you walk 
the street of Florence the glad multitude 
in throng press but to see you and with joy 
the father point with his finger tell 
his son this be the prince the hopeful prince 
that must hereafter rule and you obey he 
great lady beg your picture and make love 
to that despair to enjoy the substance 
and but the last night when it be only rumour 
that you be come to court as if you have 
by sea past hither from another world 
what general shout and acclamation follow 
the bell ring loud the bonfire blaze and such 
as love not wine carrow sing to your health 
be drink and blush not at it and be this 
a happiness to part with 

I allow these 
as flourish of fortune with which prince 
be often soothe but never yet esteem they 
for real blessing 

yet all these be pay 
to what you may be not to what you be 
for if the great duke but show to his servant 
a son of his own you shall like one obscure 
pass unregarded 

I confess command 
be not to be contemn and if my fate 
appoint i to it as I may I will bear it 
with will shoulder but my lord as yet 
you have tell i of a danger come towards i 
but have not name it 

that be soon deliver 
great Cozimo your uncle as I more 
than guess for it be no frivolous circumstance 
that do persuade my judgement to believe it 
purpose to be marry 

marry sir 
with who and on what term pray you instruct i 

with the fair Lydia 

Lydia 

the daughter 
of signior Charomonte 

pardon i 
though I appear incredulous for on 
my knowledge he never see she 

that be grant 
but Contarino have so sing her praise 
and give she out for such a masterpiece 
that he be transport with it sir and love 
steal sometime through the care into the heart 
as well as by the eye the duke no soon 
hear she describe but I be send in post 
to see she and return my judgement of she 

and what be your censure 

it be a pretty creature 

she be very fair 

yes yes I have see worse face 

her limb be neat form 

she have a waste 
indeed size to love wish 

a delicate hand too 

then for a leg and foot 

and there I leave you 
for I presume no further 

as she be sir 
I know she want no gracious part that may 
allure the duke and if he only see she 
she be his own he will not be deny 
and than you be lose yet if you will second i 
as you have reason for it most concern you 
I can prevent all yet 

I will you can 
a noble way 

I will cry down her beauty 
especial the beauty of her mind 
as much as Contarino have advance they 
and this I hope will breed forgetfulness 
and kill affection in he but you must 
join with i in my report if you be question 

I never tell a lie yet and I hold it 
in some degree blasphemous to dispraise 
what be worthy admiration yet for once 
I will dispraise a little and not vary 
from your relation 

be constant in it 

my lord the duke have see your man and wonder 
you come not to he see if his desire 
to have conference with you have not bring 
he hither in his own person 

they be comely courser 
and promise swiftness 

they be of my knowledge 
of the best race in Naples 

you be nephew 
as I hear a excellent horseman and we like it 
it be a fair grace in a prince pray you make trial 
of their strength and speed and if you think they fit 
for your employment with a liberal hand 
reward the gentleman that do present they 
from the viceroy of Naples 

I will use 
my best endeavour sir 

wait on my nephew 
nay stay you Contarino be within call 
it may be we shall use you you have ride hard sir 
and we thank you for it Every minute seem 
irksome and tedious to we till you have 
make your discovery say friend have you see 
this phoenix of our age 

I have see a maid sir 
but if that I have judgement no such wonder 
as she be deliver to you 

this be strange 

but certain truth it may be she be look on 
with admiration in the country sir 
but if compare with many in your court 
she will appear but ordinary 

Contarino 
report she otherwise 

such as never see swan 
may think crow beautiful 

how be her behaviour 

it be like the place she live in 

how her wit 
discourse and entertainment 

very course 
I will not willing say poor and rude 
but have she all the beauty of fair woman 
the dulness of her soul will fright i from she 

you be curious sir I know not what to think on it 
Contarino 

sir 

where be thy judgement man 
to extol a virgin Sanazarro tell i 
be near to deformity 

I see she 
and curious peruse she and I wonder 
that she that do appear to i that know 
what beauty be not worthy the observe 
shall so transport you 

troth my lord I think then 

thought do thou not affirm it 

I confess sir 
I do believe so then but now I hear 
my lord opinion to the contrary 
I be of another faith for it be not fit 
that I shall contradict he I be dim sir 
but he be sharp sight 

this be to my wish 

we know not what to think of this yet will not 
determine rash of it how do you like 
my nephew horsemanship 

in my judgement sir 
it be exact and rare 

and to my fancy 
he do present great Alexander mount 
on his Bucephalus 

you be right courtier 
and know it be your duty to cry up 
all action of a prince 

do not betray 
yourself you be safe I have do my part 

I thank you 
nor will I fail 

what be your opinion nephew 
of the horse 

two of they be in my judgement 
the best I ever back I mean the roan sir 
and the brown bay but for the chestnut colour 
though he be full of mettle hot and fiery 
he tread weak in his pastern 

So come near 
this exercise have put you into a sweat 
take this and dry it and now I command you 
to tell i true what be your censure of 
Charomonte daughter Lydia 

I be sir 
a novice in my judgement of a lady 
but such as it be your grace shall hear it free 
I will not speak in of she and be sorry 
if I keep myself a friend to truth I can 
report she as I will so much I owe 
her reverend father but I will give you sir 
as near as I can her character in little 
she be of a goodly stature and her limb 
not disproportion for her face it be 
far from deformity yet they flatter she 
that style it excellent her manner be 
simple and innocent but her discourse 
and wit deserve my pity more than praise 
at her best my lord she be a handsome picture 
and that say all be speak 

I believe you 
I never yet find you false 

nor ever shall sir 
forgive i matchless Lydia I too much love 
and jealous fear to lose thou do compel i 
against my will my reason and my knowledge 
to be a poor detractor of that beauty 
which fluent Ovid if he live again 
will want word to express 

pray you make choice of 
the rich of our furniture for those horse 
and take my nephew with you we in this 
will follow his direction 

can I find now 
the princess Fiorinda and persuade she 
to be silent in the suit that I move to her 
all be secure 

in that my lord it will aid you 

we will be private leave we all my study 
and serious meditation aim no further 
than this young man good he be my sister son 
and she be such a sister when she live 
I can not prize too much nor can I better 
make know how dear I hold her memory 
then in my cherish the only issue 
which she have leave behind she who be that 

sir 

my fair charge you be welcome to we 

I have find it sir 

all thing go well in Urbino 

your gracious care to i a orphan free i 
from all suspicion that my jealous fear can drive into my fancy 

the next summer 
in our own person we will bring you thither 
and seat you in your own 

when you think fit sir 
but in the mean time with your highness pardon 
I be a suitor to you 

name it madam 
with confidence to obtain it 

that you will please 
to lay a strict command on Charomonte 
to bring his daughter Lydia to the court 
and pray you think sir that it be not my purpose 
to employ she as a servant but to use she 
as a most wish companion 

ha your reason 

the hopeful prince your nephew sir have give she 
to i for such a abstract of perfection 
in all that can be wish for in a virgin 
as beauty music ravish discourse 
quickness of apprehension with choice manner 
and learning to not usual with woman 
that I be much ambitious though I shall 
appear but as a foil to set she off 
to be from she instruct and supply 
in what I be defective 

do my nephew 
serious deliver this 

I assure your grace 
with zeal and vehemency and even when 
with his best word he strive to set she forth 
though the rare subject make he eloquent 
he will complain all he can say come short 
of her deserve 

pray you have patience 
this be strange carry ha be we trist with 
dare they do this be Cozimo fury that 
of late be terrible grow contemptible 
well we will clear our brow and undermine 
their secret work though they have dig like mole 
and crush they with the tempest of my wrath 
when I appear most calm he be unfit 
to command other that know not to use it 
and with all rigour yet my stern look shall not 
discover my intent for I will strike 
when I begin to frown you be the mistress 
of that you do demand 

I thank your highness 
but speed in the performance of the grant 
double the favour sir 

you shall possess it soon than you expect 
only be please to be ready when my secretary 
wait upon you to take the fresh air my nephew 
and my bosom friend so to cheat i it be not fair 

where shall this princess be nor in her lodging 
nor in the private walk her own retreat 
which she so much frequent 

by my life 
she be with the duke and I much more than fear 
her forwardness to prefer my suit have ruine 
what with such care we build up 

have you furnish 
those courser as we will you 

there be no sign 
of anger in his look 

they be complete sir 

it be well to your rest soft sleep wait on you madam 
tomorrow with the rise of the sun 
be ready to ride with we they with more safety 
have tread on forktongued adder then provoke i 

I come not to be thank sir for the speedy 
performance of my promise touch Lydia 
it be effect 

we be undo 

the duke 
no soon hear i with my best of language 
describe her excellency as you teach i 
but he confirm it you look sad as if 
you wish it be undo 

no gracious madam 
I be your servant for it 

be you as careful 
for what I move to you count Sanazarro 
now I perceive you honour i in vouchsafe 
to wear so slight a favour 

it be a grace 
I be unworthy of 

you merit more 
in prize so a trifle take this diamond 
I will second what I have begin for know 
your valour have so win upon i that 
it be not to be resist I have say sir 
and leave you to interpret it 

This to i 
be wormwood it be apparent we be take 
in our own noose what be to be do 

I know not 
and it be a punishment just fall upon i 
for leave truth a constant mistress that 
ever protect her servant to become 
a slave to lie and falsehood what excuse 
can we make to the duke what mercy hope for 
our pack be lay open 

it be not to 
be question but his purpose journey be 
to see fair Lydia 

and to divert he 
impossible 

there be now no look backward 

and which way to go on with safety not 
to be imagine 

give i leave I have 
a embryo in my brain which I despair not 
may be bring to form and fashion provide 
you will be open breasted 

it be no time now 
our danger be equal to conceal 
a thought from you 

what power hold you over Lydia 
do you think that with some hazard of her life 
she will prevent your ruin 

I presume so 
if in the undertake it she stray not

a holy day to i that bring my prince 
under my humble roof 

see sir my good tutor 
shed tear for joy 

dry they up Charomonte 
and all forbear the room while we exchange 
some private word together 

o my lord 
how gross have we overshoot ourselves 

in what sir 

in forget to acquaint 
my guardian with our purpose all that Lydia 
can do avail we nothing if the duke 
find out the truth from he 

it be now pass help 
and we must stand the hazard hope the best sir 

my loyalty doubt sir 

it be more thou have 
abuse our trust and in a high degree 
commit treason 

treason it be a word 
my innocence understand not be my breast 
transparent and my thought to be discern 
not one spot shall be find to taint the candour 
of my allegiance and I must be bold 
to tell you sir for he that know no guilt 
can know no fear it be tyranny to over charge 
a honest man and such till now I have live 
and such my lord I will die 

sir do not flatter 
yourself with hope these great and glorious word 
which every guilty wretch as well as you 
that be arm with impudence can with ease deliver 
and with as full a mouth can work on we 
nor shall gay flourish of language clear 
what be in fact apparent 

fact what fact 
you that know only what it be instruct i 
for I be ignorant 

This then sir we give up 
on our assurance of your faith and care 
our nephew Giovanni nay our heir 
in expectation to be train up by you 
as do become a prince 

and I discharge it 
be this the treason 

take we with you sir 
and in respect we know his youth be prone 
to woman and that live in our court 
he may make some unworthy choice before 
his weak judgement be confirm we do 
remove he from it constant presume 
you with your best endeavour rather will 
have quench those heat in he then light a torch 
as you have do to his looseness 

I my travail 
be ill requite sir for by my soul 
I be so curious that way that I grant 
access to none can tempt he nor do ever 
one syllable or obscene accent touch 
his care that may corrupt he 

no why then 
with your allowance do you give free way 
to all familiar privacy between 
my nephew and your daughter or why do you 
have you no other end in it but our service 
read to they and together as they have be 
scholar of one form grammar rhetoric 
philosophy story and interpret to they 
the close temptation of lascivious poet 
or wherefore for we still have spy upon you 
be she still present when by your advice 
he be teach the use of his weapon horsemanship 
wrestle nay swim but to fan in she 
a hot desire of he and then forsooth 
his exercise end cover with 
a fair pretence of recreation for he 
when Lydia be instruct in those grace 
that add to beauty he bring to admire she 
must hear she sing while to her voice her hand 
make ravish music and this applaud dance 
a light levalto with she 

have you end 
all you can charge i with 

nor stop you there 
but they must unattended walk into 
the silent grove and hear the amorous bird 
warble their wanton note here a sure shade 
of barren sycamore which the allseeing sun 
can not pierce through near that a arbour hang 
with spread eglantine there a bubble spring 
water a bank of hyacinth and lily 
with all allurement that can move to lust 
and can this Charomonte shall I grant 
they have be equal both in birth and fortune 
become your gravity nay it be clear as air 
that your ambitious hope to match your daughter 
into our family give connivance to it 
and this though not in act in the intent 
I call high treason 

hear my just defence sir 
and though you be my prince it will not take from 
your greatness to acknowledge with a blush 
in this my accusation you have be 
more sway by spleen and jealous supposition 
then certain ground of reason you have a father 
bless be his memory that make frequent proof 
of my loyalty and faith and will I boast 
the danger I have break through in his service 
I can say more nay you yourself dread sir 
when ever I be put unto the test 
find i true gold and not adulterate metal 
and be I doubt now 

this be from the purpose 

I will come to it sir your grace well know 
before the prince happy presence make 
my poor house rich the chief blessing which 
I glory in though now it prove a curse 
be a only daughter nor do you command i 
as a security to your future fear 
to cast she off which have you do however 
she be the light of my eye and comfort of 
my feeble age so far I prize my duty 
above affection she now have be 
a stranger to my care but she be fair 
be that her fault or i do ever father 
hold beauty in his issue for a blemish 
her education and her manner tempt to 
if these offend they be easy remove 
you may if you think fit before my face 
in recompense of all my watch for you 
with burn corrosive transform she to 
a ugly leper and this do to taint 
her sweetness prostitute she to a loathsome brothel 
this I will rather suffer sir and more 
then live suspect by you 

let not passion 
carry you beyond your reason 

I be calm sir 
yet you must give i leave to grieve I find 
my action misinterpret Alas sir 
be Lydia desire to serve the prince 
call a offence or do she practise to 
seduce his youth because with her best zeal 
and fervour she endeavour to attend he 
it be a hard construction though she be my daughter 
I may thus far speak she from her infancy 
she be ever civil her behaviour near 
simplicity than craft and malice dare not 
affirm in one loose gesture or light language 
she give a sign she be in thought unchaste 
I will fetch she to you sir and but look on she 
with equal eye you must in justice grant 
that your suspicion wrong she 

it may be 
but I must have strong assurance of it 
then passionate word and not to trifle time 
as we come unexpected to your house 
we will prevent all mean that may prepare she 
how to answer that with which we come to charge she 
and howsoever it may be receive 
as a foul breach to hospitable rite 
on thy allegiance and boast faith

close prisoner to thy chamber till all doubt 
be clear that do concern we 

I obey sir 
and wish your grace have follow my hearse 
to my sepulchre my loyalty unsuspected

as you be a duke 

if your grace will have i 
I will eat and drink like a emperor

but be discover

what a sight be this we can be angry with you 
how much you do belie she when you tell we 
she be only simple this be barbarous rudeness 
beyond belief 

I will not speak her sir

ere I will lose my dance 
I will speak to the purpose I be sir no prologue 
but in plain term must tell you we be provide 
of a lusty hornpipe

your grace may do it by letter 

who sign you 
a patent to direct we wait our come 
in the garden 

all will out 

i more than fear it 

these be strange chimaera to we what to judge of it 
be past our apprehension one command 
Charomonte to attend we can it be 
that Contarino can be so besot 
as to admire this prodigy or her father 
to dote upon it or do she personate 
for some end unknown to we this rude behaviour 
within the scene present will appear 
ridiculous and impossible o you be welcome 
we now acknowledge the much wrong we do you 
in our unjust suspicion we have see 
the wonder sir your daughter 

and have find she 
such as I do report she what she want 
in courtship be I hope supply in civil 
and modest entertainment

such contrariety be never read of 
Charomonte be no fool nor can I think 
his confidence build on sand we be abuse 
it be too apparent 

I be indispose sir 
and that life you tender once much endanger 
in force i from my chamber 

here she be sir 
sudden sick I grant but sure not drink 
speak to my lord the duke 

all be discover 

be this your only daughter 

and my heir sir 
nor keep I any woman in my house 
unless for sordid office but one 
I do maintain trim up in her cast habit 
to make her sport and she indeed love wine 
and will take too much of it and perhaps for mirth 
she be present to you 

it shall yield 
no sport to the contriver it be too plain now 
her presence do confirm what Contorino 
deliver of she nor can sickness dim 
the splendour of her beauty be herself then 
she must exceed his praise 

will your grace hear i 
I be faint and can say little 

here be accent 
who every syllable be musical 
pray you let i raise you and a while rest here 
false Sanazarro treacherous Giovanni 
but stand we talk 

here be a storm soon raise 

as thou be our subject Charomonte swear 
to act what we command 

that be a oath 
I long since take 

then by that oath we charge thou 
without excuse denial or delay 
to apprehend and sudden Sanazarro 
and our ingrateful nephew we have say it 
do it without reply or we pronounce thou 
like they a traitor to we see they guard 
in several lodging and forbid access 
to all but when we warrant be our will 
hear soon than obey 

these be strange turn 
but I must not dispute they 

be severe in it 
o my abuse lenity I from what height 
be my power fall 

o i most miserable 
that be innocent make other guilty 
most gracious prince 

pray you rise and then speak to i 

my knee shall first be root in this earth 
and Myrrha like I will grow up to a tree 
drop perpetual tear of sorrow which 
harden by the rough wind and turn to amber 
unfortunate virgin like myself shall wear 
before I will make petition to your greatness 
but with such reverence my hand hold up thus 
as I will do to heaven you prince be 
as god on earth to we and to be sue too 
with such humility as his deputy 
may challenge from their vassal 

here be that form 
of language I expect pray you speak 
what be your suit 

that you will look upon i 
as a humble thing that million of degree 
be place beneath you for what be I dread sir 
or what can fall in the whole course of my life 
that may be worth your care much less your trouble 
as the lowly shrub be to the lofty cedar 
or a molehill to Olympus if compare 
I be to you sir or suppose the prince 
which can find belief in i forget 
the greatness of his birth and hope have throw 
a eye of favour on i in i punish 
that be the cause the rashness of his youth 
shall the queen of the inhabitant of the air 
the eagle that bear thunder on her wing 
in her angry mood destroy her hopeful young 
for suffer a wren to perch too near they 
such be our disproportion 

with what fervour 
she plead against herself 

for i poor maid 
I know the prince to be so far above i 
that my wish can reach he yet I be 
so much his creature that to fix he in 
your wont grace and favour I will abjure 
his sight for ever and betake myself 
to a religious life where in my prayer 
I may remember he and never see man more 
but my ghostly father will you trust i sir 
in truth I will keep my word or if this fail 
a little more of fear what may befall he 
will stop my breath for ever 

have you thus argue 
as you be yourself and bring as advocate 
your health and beauty to make way for you 
no crime of he can put on such a shape 
but I shall look with the eye of mercy on it 
what will I give to see this diamond 
in her perfect lustre as she be before 
the cloud of sickness dim it yet take comfort 
and as you will obtain remission for 
his treachery to i cheer your droop spirit 
and call the blood again into your cheek 
and then plead for he and in such a habit 
as in your high hope you will put on 
if we be to receive you for our bride 

I will do my best sir 

and that best will be 
a crown of all felicity to i 


it be prove in i the curse of humane frailty 
add to our affliction make we know 
what be good and yet our violent passion force we 
to follow what be ill reason assure i 
it be not safe to shave a lion skin 
and that to trifle with a sovereign be 
to play with lightning yet imperious beauty 
tread upon the neck of understanding 
compel i to put off my natural shape 
of loyal duty to disguise myself 
in the adulterate and cobweb mask 
of disobedient treachery where be now 
my borrow greatness or the promise life 
of follow courtier echo my will 
in a moment vanish power that stand not on 
its proper base which be peculiar only 
to absolute prince fall or rise with 
their frown or favour the great duke my master 
who almost change i to his other self 
no soon take his beam of comfort from i 
but I as one unknown or unregarded 
unpitied suffer who make intercession 
to his mercy for i now who do remember 
the service I have do he not a man 
and such as speak no language but my lord 
the favourite of Tuscany grand duke 
deride my madness ha what noise of horse

Contarino yes it be he and Lodovico 
and the duchess Fiorinda Urbin heir 
a princess I have slight yet I wear 
her favour and to teach i what I be 
she who I scorn can only meditate for i 
this way she make yet speak to she I dare not 
and how to make suit to she be a task 
of as much difficulty yes thou bless pledge 
of her affection aid i This supply 
the want of pen and ink and this of paper

if by your gracious mean he can have 
a pardon and that get be life your slave

of i the most belove and I will save thou 
or perish with thou sure thy fault must be 
of some prodigious shape if that my prayer 
and humble intercession to the duke

shall not make less my benefit 

what we purpose 
shall know no change and therefore move i not 
we be make as property and what we shall 
determine of they can be call rigour 
but noble justice when they prove disloyal 
they be cruel to themselves the prince that pardon 
the first affront offer to majesty

subject shall tremble at contemptible 
ingratitude be a monster Carolo 
to be strangle in the birth not to be cherish 
madam you be happy meet with

this compassion in you 
must make the colour of his guilt more ugly 
the honour we have hourly heap upon he 
the title the reward to the envy of 
the old nobility as the common people 
we now forbear to touch at and will only 
insist on his gross wrong to you you be please 
forget both yourself and proper greatness 
to favour he nay to court he to embrace 
a happiness which on his knee with joy 
he shall have sue for who repine not at 
the grace you do he yet in recompense 
of your large bounty the disloyal wretch 
make you a stale and what he may be by you 
scorn and deride give himself up whole 
to the service of another if you can 
bear this with patience we must say you have not 
the bitterness of spleen or ireful passion 
familiar to woman pause upon it 
and when you serious have weigh his carriage

his advocate for he we perhaps because 
we will deny you nothing may awake

nor will I give it over thus 

do our nephew 
bear his restraint so constant as you 
deliver it to we 

in my judgement sir 
he suffer more for his offence to you 
then in his fear of what can follow it 
for he be so collect and prepare 
to welcome that you shall determine of he 
as if his doubt and fear be equal to he 
and sure he be not acquaint with much guilt 
that more lament the tell one untruth 
under your pardon still for it be a fault sir 
then other that pretend to conscience do 
their cry secret sin

I once more must make bold sir 
to trench upon your patience I have 
consider my wrong due yet that can 
divert my intercession for a man 
your grace like i once favour I be still 
a suppliant to you that you will vouchsafe 
the hear his defence and that I may 
with your allowance see and comfort he 
then have hear all that he can allege 
in his excuse for be false to you

you will overcome 
there be no contend with you pray you enjoy 
what you desire and tell he he shall have 
a speedy trial in which we will forbear 
to sit a judge because our purpose be 
to rise up his accuser

of happiness wait on Cozimo 

be it no more 

my honor be pawn for it 

I will second you 

since it be for the service and the safety 
of the hopeful prince fall what can fall I will run 
the desperate hazard 

he be no friend to virtue 
that do decline it 

ha what sue you for 
shall we be ever trouble do not tempt 
that anger may consume you 

let it sir 
the loss be less though innocent we perish 
then that your sister son shall fall unheard 
under your fury shall we fear to entreat 
that grace for he that be your faithful servant 
which you vouchsafe the count like we a subject 

do not we vow till sickness have forsake 
thy daughter Lydia and she appear 
in her perfect health and beauty to plead for he 
we be deaf to all persuasion 

and that hope sir 
have wrought a miracle she be recover 
and if you please to warrant she will bring 
the penitent prince before you 

to enjoy 
such happiness what will we not dispense with 

we all kneel for the prince 

nor can it stand 
with your mercy that be gracious to stranger 
to be cruel to your own 

but be thou certain 
I shall behold she at the best 

if ever 
she be handsome as it fit not i to say so 
she be now much better 

rise thou be but dead 
if this prove otherwise Lydia appear 
and feast a appetite almost pine to death 
with long expectation to behold 
thy excellency thou as beauty queen 
shall censure the detractor let my nephew 
be lead in triumph under her command 
we will have it so and Sanazarro tremble 
to think who he have slander we will retire 
ourselves a little and prepare to meet 
a blessing which imagination tell we 
we be not worthy of and then come forth 
but with such reverence as if I be 
my self the priest the sacrifice my heart 
to offer at the altar of that goodness 
that must or kill or save i 

be not these 
strange gambol in the duke 

great prince have 
like mean man their weakness 

and may use it 
without control or check 

it be fit they shall 
their privilege be less else than their subject 

let they have their humour there be no cross they 

and can it be your bounty shall fall down 
in shower on my ingratitude or the wrong 
your greatness shall revenge teach you to pity 
what retribution can I make what service 
pay to your goodness that in some proportion 
may to the world express I will be thankful 
since my engagement be so great that all 
my best endeavour to appear your creature 
can but proclaim my want and what I owe 
to your magnificence 

all debt be discharge 
in this acknowledgement yet since you please 
I shall impose some term of satisfaction 
for that which you profess yourself oblige for 
they shall be gentle one and such as will not 
I hope afflict you 

make i understand 
great princess what they be and my obedience 
shall with all cheerful willingness subscribe 
to what you shall command 

I will bind you to 
make good your promise first I then enjoin you 
to love a lady that a noble way 
true affect you and that you will take 
to your protection and care the dukedom 
of Urbino which no more be i but you 
and that when you have full possession of 
my person as my fortune you will use i 
not as a princess but instruct i in 
the duty of a humble wife for such 
the privilege of my birth no more remember 
I will be to you This consent to 
all injury forget on your lip 
I thus sign your quietus 

I be wretched 
in have but one life to be employ 
as you please to dispose it and believe it 
if it be not already forfeit 
to the fury of my prince as it be your gift 
with all the faculty of my soul I will study 
in what I may to serve you 

I be happy 
in this assurance what 
sweet lady be this 

it be Lydia madam she 

I understand you 
nay blush not by my life she be a rare one 
and if I be your judge I will not blame you 
to like and love she but sir you be my now 
and I presume so on your constancy 
that I dare not be jealous 

all thought of she 
be in your goodness bury 

pray you sir 
be comfort your innocence shall not know 
what it be to fear and if that you but look on 
the guard that you have in yourself you can 
the duke be your uncle sir and though a little 
incense against you when he see your sorrow 
he must be reconcile what rugged tartar 
or cannibal though bathe in humane gore 
but look on your sweetness will forget 
his cruel nature and let fall his weapon 
though then aim at your throat 

o Lydia 
of maid the honour and your sex glory 
it be not fear to die but to lose you 
that bring this fever on i I will now 
discover to you that which till this minute 
I dare not trust the air with ere you know 
what power the magic of your beauty have 
I be enchant by it like and love it 
my fondness still increase with my year 
and flatter by false hope I do attend 
some bless opportunity to move 
the duke with his consent to make you i 
but now such be my starcrossed destiny 
when he behold you as you be he can 
deny himself the happiness to enjoy you 
and I as well in reason may entreat he 
to give away his crown as to part from 
a jewel of more value such you be 
yet howsoever when you be his duchess 
and I be turn into forget dust 
pray you love my memory I shall say more 
but I be eve off 

the duke that convenance once 
when it be clothe in smile show like a angel 
but now it be fold up in cloud of fury 
it be terrible to look on 

sir 

a while 
silence your musical tongue and let i feast 
my eye with the most ravish object that 
they ever gaze on there be no miniature 
in her fair face but be a copious theme 
which will discourse at large of make a volume 
what clear arch brow what sparkle eye the lily 
contend with the rose in her cheek 
who shall most set they off what ruby lip 
or unto what can I compare her neck 
but to a rock of crystal every limb 
proportion to love wish and in their neatness 
add lustre to the riches of her habit 
not borrow from it 

you be please to show sir 
the fluency of your language in advance 
a subject much unworthy 

how unworthy 
by all the vow which lover offer at 
the cyprian goddess altar eloquence 
itself presume as you be to speak you 
will be strike dumb and what have you deserve then 
wretch you kneel too late that have endeavour 
to spout the poison of your black detraction 
on this immaculate whiteness be it malice 
to her perfection or 

your highness promise 
a gracious hear to the count 

and prince too 
do not make void so just a grant 

we will not 
yet since their accusation must be urge 
and strong ere their weak defence have hear 
we seat you here as judge to determine 
of your gross wrong and we and now remember 
who deputy you be be neither sway 
or with particular spleen or foolish pity 
for neither can become you 

there be some hope yet 
since they have such gentle judge 

rise and stand forth then 
and hear with horror to your guilty soul 
what we will prove against you can this princess 
thou enemy to thyself stoop her high flight 
of tower greatness to invite thy lowness 
to look up to it and with nimble wing 
of gratitude can thou forbear to meet it 
Were her favour boundless in a noble way 
and warrant by our allowance yet 
in thy acceptation there appear no sign 
of a modest thankfulness 

pray you forbear 
to press that far it be a fault we have 
already hear and pardon 

we will then pass over it and brief touch at that 
which do concern ourself in which both be 
equal offender what we shall speak point 
indifferent at either how we raise thou 
forgetful Sanazarro of our grace 
to a full possession of power and honour 
it be too well know we will not remember 
and what thou be rash youth in expectation 
and from which headlong thou have throw thyself 
not Florence but all Tuscany can witness 
with admiration to assure thy hope 
we do keep constant to a widow bed 
and do deny ourself those lawful pleasure 
our absolute power and height of blood allow we 
make both the key that open our heart secret 
and what you speak believe as oracle 
but you in recompense of this to he 
that give you all to who you owe your be 
with treacherous lie endeavour to conceal 
this jewel from our knowledge which ourself 
can only lay just claim too 

it be most true sir 

we both confess a guilty cause 

look on she 
be this a beauty fit to be embrace 
by any subject arm can any tire 
become that forehead but a diadem 
or shall we grant your be false to we 
can be excuse your treachery to she 
in seek to deprive she of that greatness 
her matchless form consider she be bear too 
must never find pardon we have speak lady 
like a rough orator that bring more truth 
than rhetoric to make good his accusation 
and now expect your sentence 

in your birth sir 
you be mark out the judge of life and death 
and we that be your subject to attend 
with tremble fear your doom 

we do resign 
this chair as only proper to yourself 

and since in justice we be lose we fly 
unto your save mercy 

which set off 
a prince much more than rigour 

And become he 
when it be express to such as fall by weakness 
that be a twinborn brother to affection 
better than wreathe of conquest 
hie Lod con Alph we allspeake 
their language mighty sir 

you know our temper 
and therefore with more boldness venture on it 
and will not our consent to your demand 
deprive we of a happiness hereafter 
ever to be despair of we perhaps 
may hearken near to you and can wish 
with some qualification or excuse 
you may make less the mountain of your crime 
and so invite our clemency to feast with you 
but you that know with what impatiency 
of grief we part from the fair Clarinda 
our duchess let she memory still be sacred 
and with what imprecation on ourself 
we vow not hope ever to see her equal 
never to make trial of a second choice 
if nature frame not one that do excel she 
as this maid beauty prompt we that she do 
and yet with oath then mix with tear upon 
her monument we swear our eye shall never 
again be tempt it be true and those vow 
be register above something here tell i 
Carolo thou hear we swear 

and swear so deep 
that if all woman beauty be in this 
as she be not to be name with the dead duchess 
nay all their virtue bind up in one story 
of which i be scarce a epitome 
if you shall take she as a wife the weight 
of your perjury will sink you if I dare 
I have tell you this before 

it be strong truth Carolo 
and yet what be necessity in we 
can free they from treason 

there be your error 
the prince in care to have you keep your vow 
make unto heaven vouchsafe to love my daughter 

he tell i so indeed sir 

and the count 
aver as much to i 

you all conspire 
to force our mercy from we 

which give up 
to aftertime preserve you unforsworn 
a honour which will live upon your tomb 
when your greatness be forget 

though we know 
all this be practice and that both be false 
such reverence we will pay to dead Clarinda 
and to our serious oath that we be please 
with our own hand to blind our eye and not 
know what we understand here Giovanni 
we pardon thou and take from we in this 
more than our dukedom love she as I part 
with she all thought of woman fly fast from we 
Sanazarro we forgive you in your service 
to this princess merit it yet let not other 
that be in trust and grace as you have be 
by the example of our lenity 
presume upon their sovereign clemency 

long live great Cozimo 

sure the duke be 
in the give vain they be so loud Come on spouse 
we have hear all and we will have our boon too 

what be it 

that your grace in remembrance of 
my share in a dance and that I play your part 
when you shall have drink hard will get this signior grant 
to give this damsel to i in the church 
for we be contract in it you shall do 
your dukedom pleasure 

how 

why the whole race 
of such as can act natural fool part 
be quite wear out and they that do survive 
do only zany we and we will bring you 
if we die not without issue of both sex 
such chap mirthmaker as shall preserve 
perpetual cause of sport both to your grace 
and your posterity that sad melancholy 
shall never approach you 

we be please in it 
and will pay her portion May the passage prove 
of what be present worthy of your love 
and favour as be aim and we have all 
that can in compass of our wish fall
