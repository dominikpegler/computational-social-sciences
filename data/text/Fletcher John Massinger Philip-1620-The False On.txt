i love the K nor do dispute his power 
for that be not confine nor to be censure 
by i that be his subject yet allow i 
the liberty of a man that still will be 
a friend to justice to demand the motive 
that do induce young Ptolemy or Photinus 
to who direction he give up himself 
and I hope wise to commit his sister 
the princess Cleopatra if I say 
the queen Achillas it be I hope no treason 
she be by her father testament 
who memory I bow to leave coheir 
in all he stand possess of 

it be confess 
my good Achoreus that in these eastern kingdom 
woman be not exempt from the sceptre 
but claim a privilege equal to the male 
but how much such division have take from 
the majesty of Egypt and what faction 
have spring from those partition to the ruin 
of the poor subject doubtful which to follow 
we have too many and too sad example 
therefore the wise Photinus to prevent 
the murder and the massacre that attend 
on disunited government and to show 
the king without a partner in full splendour 
think it convenient the fair Cleopatra 
a attribute not frequent in this climate 
shall be commit to safe custody 
in which she be attend like her birth 
until her beauty or her royal dowry 
have find she out a husband 

how this may 
stand with the rule of policy I know not 
most sure I be it hold no correspondence 
with the rite of Egypt or the law of nature 
but grant that Cleopatra can sit down 
with this disgrace though insupportable 
can you imagine that Rome glorious senate 
to who charge by the will of the dead king 
this government be deliver or great Pompey 
that be appoint Cleopatra guardian 
as well as Ptolemy will ere approve 
of this rash counsel their consent not seek for 
that shall authorise it 

the civil war 
in which the Roman empire be embark 
on a rough sea of danger do exact 
their whole care to preserve themselves and give they 
no vacant time to think of what we do 
which hardly can concern they 

what be your opinion 
of the success I have hear in multitude 
of soldier and all glorious pomp of war 
Pompey be much superior 

I can give you 
a catalogue of all the several nation 
from whence he draw his power but that be tedious 
they have rich arm be ten to one in number 
which make they think the day already win 
and Pompey be master of the sea 
such plenty of all delicate be bring in 
as if the place on which they be entrench 
be not a camp of soldier but Rome 
in which Lucullus and Apicius join 
to make a public feast they at Dirachium 
fight with success but know not to make use of 
fortune fair offer so much I have hear 
Caesar himself confess 

where be they now 

in Thessaly near the pharsalian plain 
where Caesar with a handful of his man 
hem in the great number he whole troop 
exceed not twenty thousand but old soldier 
flesh in the spoil of Germany and France 
enure to his command and only know 
to fight and overcome and though that famine 
reign in his camp compel they to taste 
bread make of root forbid the use of man 
which they with scorn throw into Pompey camp 
as in derision of his delicate 
or corn not yet half ripe and that a banquet 
they still besiege he be ambitious only 
to come to blow and let their sword determine 
who have the better cause 

May victory 
attend on it where it be 

we every hour 
expect to hear the issue 

save my good lord 
by Isis and Osiris who you worship 
and the four hundred god and goddess 
adore in Rome I be your honour servant 

truth needs Seprinius no oath 

you be cruel 
if you deny he swear you take from he 
three full part of his language 

your honour be bitter 
confound i where I love I can say it 
but I must swear it yet such be my ill fortune 
nor vow nor protestation win belief 
I think and I can find no other reason 
because I be a roman 

no Septinius 
to be a roman be a honour to you 
do not your manner and your life take from it 
and cry aloud that from Rome you bring nothing 
but Roman vice which you will plant here 
but no seed of her virtue 

with your reverence 
I be too old to learn 

any thing honest 
that I believe without a oath 

I fear 
your lordship have sleep ill tonight and that 
invite this sad discourse it will make you old 
before your time on these virtuous moral 
and old religious principle that fool we 
I have bring you a new song will make you laugh 
though you be at your prayer 

what be the subject 
be free Septinius 

it be a catalogue 
of all the gamester of the court and city 
which lord lie with that lady and what gallant 
sport with that merchant wife and do relate 
who sell her honour for a diamond 
who for a tissue robe who husband be jealous 
and who so kind that to share with his wife 
will make the match himself 
harmless conceit 
though fool say they be dangerous I sing it 
the last night at my lord Photinus table 

how as a fiddler 

no sir as a guest 
a welcome guest too and it be approve of 
by a dozen of his friend though they be touch in it 
for look you it be a kind of merriment 
when we have lay by foolish modesty 
as not a man of fashion will wear it 
to talk what we have do at least to hear it 
if merry set down it fire the blood 
and heighten crestfallen appetite 

new doctrine 

be it of your own compose 

no I buy it 
of a skulk scribbler for two Ptolemy 
but the hint be i own the wretch be fearful 
but I have damn myself shall it be question 
that I will own it 

and be punish for it 
take heed for you may so long exercise 
your scurrilous wit against authority 
the kingdom counsel and make profane jest 
which to you be a atheist be nothing 
against religion that your great maintainer 
unless they will be think copartner with you 
will leave you to the law and then Septinius 
remember there be whip 

for whore I grant you 
till they be out of date till then be safe too 
or all the gallant of the court be eunuch 
and for my own defence I will only add this 
I will be admit for a wanton tale 
to some most private cabinet when your priesthood 
though lade with the mystery of your goddess 
shall wait without unnoted so I leave you 
to your pious thought Exit 

it be a strange impudence 
this fellow do put on 

the wonder great 
he be accept of 

vice for he 
make as free way as virtue do for other 
it be the time fault yet great one still have grace 
to make they sport or rub they over with flattery 
observe of all kind 

no more of he 
he be not worth our thought a fugitive 
from Pompey army and now in a danger 
when he shall use his service 

see how he hang 
on great Photinus ear 

hell and the fury 
and all the plague of darkness light upon i 
you be my god on earth and let i have 
your favour here fall what can fall hereafter 

thou be believe do thou want money 

no sir 

or have thou any suit these ever follow 
thy vehement protestation 

you much wrong i 
how can I want when your beam shine upon i 
unless employment to express my zeal 
to do your greatness service do but think 
a deed so dark the sun will blush to look on 
for which mankind will curse i and arm all 
the power above and those below against i 
command i I will on 

when I have use 
I will put you to the test 

may it be speedy 
and something worth my danger you be cold 
and know not your own power this brow be fashion 
to wear a kingly wreath and your grave judgement 
give to dispose of monarchy not to govern 
a child affair the people eye upon you 
the soldier court you will you wear a garment 
of sordid loyalty when it be out of fashion 

when Pompey be thy general Septinius 
thou say as much to he 

all my love to he 
to Caesar Rome and the whole world be lose 
in the ocean of your bounty I have no friend 
project design or country but your favour 
which I will preserve at any rate 

no more 
when I call on you fall not off perhaps 
soon than you expect I may employ you 
so leave i for a while 

ever your creature Exit 

good day Achoreus my best friend Achillas 
have fame deliver yet no certain rumour 
of the great roman action 

that we be 
to inquire and learn of you sir who grave care 
for Egypt happiness and great Ptolemy good 
have eye and ear in all part 

I will not boast 
what my intelligence cost i but ere long 
you shall know more the king with he a Roman 

the scarlet livery of unfortunate war 
die deep on his face 

it be Labienus 
Caesar lieutenant in the war of Gaul 
and fortunate in all his undertake 
but since these civil jar he turn to Pompey 
and though he follow the better cause 
not with the like success 

such as be wise 
leave fall building fly to those that rise 
but more of that hereafter 

in a word sir 
these gape wound not take as a slave 
speak Pompey osse to tell you of the battle 
how many thousand several bloody shape 
death wear that day in triumph how we bear 
the shock of Caesar charge or with what fury 
his soldier come on as if they have be 
so many Caesar and like he ambitious 
to tread upon the liberty of Rome 
how father kill their son or son their father 
or how the roman peil on either side 
draw Roman blood which spend the prince of weapon 
the sword succeed which in civil war 
appoint the tent on which wing victory 
shall make a certain stand then how the plain 
flow over with blood and what a cloud of praetor 
and other bird of prey hang over both army 
attend when their ready servitor 
the soldier from who the angry god 
have take all sense of reason and of pity 
will serve in their own carcase for a feast 
how Caesar with his javelin force they on 
that make the least stop when their angry hand 
be lift up against some know friend face 
then come to the body of the army 
he show the sacred senate and forbid they 
to waste their force upon the common soldier 
who willing if ere he do know pity 
he will have spare 

the reason Labienus 

full well he know that in their blood he be 
to pass to empire and that through their bowel 
he must invade the law of Rome and give 
a period to the liberty of the world 
then fall the Lepidi and the bold Corvini 
the fame Torquati Scipio and Marcelli 
name next to Pompey most renown on earth 
the noble and the commons lay together 
and pontic punic and assyrian blood 
make up one crimson lake which Pompey see 
and that his and the fate of Rome have leave he 
stand upon the rampart of his camp 
though scorn all that can fall on himself 
he pity they who fortune be embark 
in his unlucky quarrel cry aloud too 
that they shall sound retreat and save themselves 
that he desire not so much noble blood 
shall be lose in his service or attend 
on his misfortune and then take horse 
with some few of his friend he come to Lesbos 
and with Cornelia his wife and son 
he be touch upon your shore the king of Parthia 
famous in his defeature of the Crassi 
offer he his protection but Pompey 
rely on his benefit and your faith 
have choose Egypt for his sanctuary 
till he may recollect his scatter power 
and try a second day now Ptolemy 
though he appear not like that glorious thing 
that three time ride in triumph and give law 
to conquer nation and make crown his gift 
as this of you your noble father take 
from his victorious hand and you still wear it 
at his devotion to do you more honour 
in his decline estate as the straight pine 
in a full grove of he yet flourish friend 
he fly to you for succour and expect 
the entertainment of your father friend 
and guardian to yourself 

to say I grieve his fortune 
as much as if the crown I wear his gift 
be ravish from i be a holy truth 
our god can witness for i yet be young 
and not a free disposer of myself 
let not a few hour borrow for advice 
beget suspicion of unthankfulness 
which next to hell I hate pray you retire 
and take a little rest and let his wound 
be with that care attend as they be 
carve on my flesh good Labienus think 
the little respite I desire shall be 
whole employ to find the ready way 
to do great Pompey service 

May the god 
as you intend protect you Exit 

sit sit all 
it be my pleasure your advice and free 

a short deliberation in this 
may serve to give you counsel to be honest 
religious and thankful in themselves 
be forcible motive and can need no flourish 
or gloss in the persuader your keep faith 
though Pompey never rise to the height he be fall from 
Caesar himself will love and my opinion 
be still commit it to grave censure 
you pay the debt you owe he with the hazard 
of all you can call you 

what be you Photinus 

Achoreus great Ptolemy have counsel 
like a religious and honest man 
worthy the honour that he just hold 
in be priest to Isis but alas 
what in a man sequester from the world 
or in a private person be prefer 
no policy allow of in a king 
to be or just or thankful make king guilty 
and faith though praise be punish that support 
such as good fate forsake join with the god 
observe the man they favour leave the wretched 
the star be not more distant from the earth 
then profit be from honesty all the power 
prerogative and greatness of a prince 
be lose if he descend once but to steer 
his course as what be right guide he let he leave 
the sceptre that strive only to be good 
since kingdom be maintain by force and blood 

o wicked 

peace go on 

proud Pompey show how much he scorn your youth 
in think that you can keep your own 
from such as be overcome if you be tire 
with be a king let not a stranger take 
what near pledge challenge resign rather 
the government of Egypt and of Nile 
to Cleopatra that have title to they 
at least defend they from the roman gripe 
what be not Pompey while the war endure 
the conqueror will not challenge by all the world 
forsake and despise your gentle guardian 
his hope and fortune desperate make choice of 
what nation he shall fall with and pursue 
by their pale ghost slay in this civil war 
he fly not Caesar only but the senate 
of which the great part have cloy the hunger 
of sharp pharsalian fowl he fly the nation 
that he draw to his quarrel who Estate 
be sink in his and in no place receive 
have find out Egypt by he yet not ruine 
and Ptolemy thing consider just may 
complain of Pompey wherefore shall he stain 
our Egypt with the spot of civil war 
or make the peaceable or quiet Nile 
doubt of Caesar wherefore shall he draw 
his loss and overthrow upon our head 
or choose this place to suffer in already 
we have offend Caesar in our wish 
and no way leave we to redeem his favour 
but by the hand of Pompey 

great Osiris 
defend thy Egypt from such cruelty 
and barbarous ingratitude 

holy trifle 
and not to have place in design of state 
this sword which fate command i to unsheathe 
I will not draw on Pompey if not vanquish 
I grant it rather shall have pass through Caesar 
but we must follow where his fortune lead we 
all provident prince measure their intent 
accord to their power and so dispose they 
and think thou Ptolemy that thou can prop 
his ruin under who sad Rome now suffer 
or tempt the conqueror force when it be confirm 
shall we that in the battle sit as neuter 
serve he that be overcome no no he be lose 
and though it be noble to a sink friend 
to lend a help hand while there be hope 
he may recover thy part not engage 
though one most dear when all his hope be dead 
to drown he set thy foot upon his head 

most execrable council 

to be follow 
it be for the kingdom safety 

we give up 
our absolute power to thou dispose of it 
as reason shall direct thou 

good Achillas 
seek out Septimius do you but sooth he 
he be already wrought leave the dispatch 
to i of Labienus it be determine 
already how you shall proceed nor fate 
shall alter it since now the die be cast 
but that this hour to Pompey be his last Exit 

be the queen stir Eros 

yes for in truth 
she touch no bed tonight 

I be sorry for it 
and wish it be in i with my hazard 
to give her ease 

sir she accept your will 
and do acknowledge she have find you noble 
so far as if restraint of liberty 
can give admission to a thought of mirth 
she be your debtor for it 

do you tell she 
of the sport I have prepare to entertain she 
Shee be use to take delight with her fair hand 
to angle in the Nile where the glad fish 
as if they know who it be seek to deceive they 
contend to be take other time 
to strike the stag who wound by her arrow 
forget his tear in death and kneel thank she 
to his last gasp than proud of his fate 
then if with garland crown he have be choose 
to fall a sacrifice before the altar 
of the virgin huntress the king nor great Photinus 
forbid she any pleasure and the circuit 
in which she be confine glad afford 
variety of pastime which I will 
increase with my best service 

o but the thought 
that she that be bear free and to dispense 
restraint or liberty to other shall be 
at the devotion of her brother who 
she only know her equal make this place 
in which she live though store with all delight 
a loathsome dungeon to she 

yet however 
she shall interpret it I will not be want 
to do my best to serve she I have prepare 
choice music near her cabinet and compose 
some few line set unto a solemn time 
in the praise of imprisonment begin boy

even the fetter that you wear 

but that we be assure this taste of duty 
and love in you my guardian and desire 
in you my sister and the rest to please we

offer our private thought but your intent 
be to delight we alas you wash a Aethiop 
can Cleopatra while she do remember 
who daughter she be and who sister oh 
I suffer in the name and that in justice 
there be no place in Egypt where I stand 
but that the tributary earth be proud 
to kiss the foot of she that be her queen 
can she I say that be all this ever relish 
of comfort or delight while base Photinus 
bond man Achillas and all other monster 
that reign over Ptolemy make that a court 
where they reside and this where I a prisoner 
but there be a Rome a senate and a Caesar 
though the great Pompey lean to Ptolemy 
may think of Cleopatra 

Pompey madam 

what of he speak if ill Appollodorus

receive a favour king have kneel in vain for 
and kiss my hand

and let your excellency propound a mean 
in which I may but give the least assistance 
that may restore you to that you be bear to

or what be more deadly all his minion 
Photinus can do to i ay unmoved 
offer my throat to serve you ever provide 
it bear some probable show to be effect 
to lose myself upon no ground be madness 
not loyal duty 

stand off to thou alone 
I will discover what I dare not trust 
my sister with Cesar be amorous 
and take more with the title of a queen 
than feature or proportion he love Eunoe 
a more deform too I have hear that bring 
no other object to inflame his blood 
but that her husband be a king on both 
he do bestow rich present shall I then 
that with a pincly birth bring beauty with i 
that know to prize myself at my own rate 
despair his favour be thou i 

I be 

I have find out away shall bring i to he 
spite of Photinus watch if I prosper 
as I be confident I shall expect 
thing great than thy wish though I purchase 
his grace with loss of my virginity

it be here it be do behold you fearful viewer 
shake and behold the model of the world here 
the pride and strength look look again it be finish 
that that whole army nay whole nation

and flee before wing with their fear and terror 
that steel war wait on and fortune court 
that high plume honour build up for her own 
behold that mightiness behold that fierceness 
behold that child of war with all his glory 
by this poor hand make breathless here my Achillas 
Egypt and Cesar owe i for this service 
and all the conquer nation 

peace Septimius 
thy word sound more ungrateful than thy action 
though sometime safety seek a instrument 
of thy unworthy nature thou loud boaster 
think not she be bind to love he too that be barbarous 
why do not I if this be meritorious 
and bind the king unto i and his bounty 
strike this rude stroke I will tell thou thou poor Roman 
it be a sacred head I dare not heave at 
not heave a thought 

it be 

I will tell thou true 
and if thou ever yet hear tell of honour 
I will make thou blush it be thy general 
that man that feed thou once that man that breed thou 
the air thou breathe be his the fire that warm thou 
from his care kindle ever nay I will show thou 
because I will make thou sensible of thy business 
and why a noble man dare not touch at it 
there be no piece of earth thou put thy foot on 
but be his conquest and he give thou motion 
he triumph three time who dare touch his person 
the very wall of Rome bow to his presence 
dear to the god he be to they that fear he 
a fair and noble enemy do thou hate he 
and for thy love to Cesar seek his ruin 
arm the red pharsalian field Septimius 
where kill be in grace and wound be glorious 
where king be fair competitor for honour 
thou shall have come up to he there have seek he 
there sword to sword 

I kill he on commandment 
if king command be fair when you all faint 
when none of you dare look 

on deed so barbarous 
what have thou get 

the king love and his bounty 
the honour of the service which though you rail at 
or a thousand envious soul fling their foam on i 
will dignify the cause and make i glorious 
and I shall live 

a miserable villain 
what reputation and reward belong to it 
thus with the head I seize on and make i 
and be not impudent to ask i why sirrah 
nor bold to stay read in my eye the reason 
the shame and obloquy I leave thy own 
inherit those reward they be fit for thou 
your oil be spend and your snuff stink go out base 

the king will yet consider Exit 

here he come sir 

yet if it be undo hear i great sir 
if this inhuman stroke be yet unstrike 
if that adore head be not yet sever 
from the most noble body weigh the misery 
the desolation that this great eclipse work 
you be young be provident fix not your empire 
upon the tomb of he will shake all Egypt 
who warlike groan will raise ten thousand spirit 
great as himself in every hand a thunder 
destruction dart from their look and sorrow 
that easy woman eye shall never empty 

you have do well and it be do see Achillas 
and in his hand the head 

stay come no near 
methinks I feel the very earth shake under i 
I do remember he he be my guardian 
appoint by the senate to preserve i 
what a full majesty fit in his face yet 

the king be trouble be not fright sir 
be not abuse with fear his death be necessary 
if you consider sir most necessary 
not to be miss and humble thank great Isis 
he come so opportune to your hand 
pity must now give place to rule of safety 
be not victorious Caesar new arrive 
and enter Alexandria with his friend 
his navy ride by to wait his charge 
do he not beat this Pompey and pursue he 
be not this great man his great enemy 
this godlike virtuous man as people hold he 
but what fool dare be friend to fly virtue 
I hear their trumpet it be too late to stagger 
give i the head and be you confident 
hail conqueror and head of all the world 
now this head be offend 

ha 

do not shun i Caesar 
from kingly Ptolemy I bring this present 
the crown and sweat of thy pharsalian labour 
the goal and mark of high ambitious honour 
before thy victory have no name Caesar 
thy travel and thy loss of blood no recompense 
thou dream of be worthy and of war 
and all thy furious conflict be but slumber 
here they take life here they inherit honour 
grow fix and shoot up everlasting triumph 
take it and look upon thy humble servant 
with noble eye look on the princely Ptolemy 
that offer with this head most mighty Caesar 
what thou will once have give for it all Egypt 

nor do not question it most royal conqueror 
nor disesteem the benefit that meet thou 
because it be easy get it come the safe 
yet let i tell thou most imperious Caesar 
though he oppose no strength of sword to win this 
nor labour through no shower of dart and lance 
yet here he find a fort that face he strong 
a inward war he be his grand sire guest 
friend to his father and when he be expel 
and beat from this kingdom by strong hand 
and have none leave he to restore his honour 
no hope to find a friend in such a misery 
then in step Pompey take his feeble fortune 
strengthen and cherish it and set it right again 
this be a love to Cesar 

give i hate god 

This Cesar may account a little wicked 
but yet remember if thy own hand conqueror 
have fall upon he what it have be then 
if thy own sword have touch his throat what that way 
he be thy son in law there to be taint 
have be most terrible let the worst be render 
we have deserve for keep thy hand innocent 

o Sceva Sceva see that head see captain 
the head of godlike Pompey 

he be base rvinde 
but let the god be grieve that suffer it 
and be you Cesar 

o thou conqueror 
thou glory of the world once now the pity 
thou awe of nation wherefore do thou fall thus 
what poor fate follow thou and pluck thou on 
to trust thy sacred life to a egyptian 
the life and light of Rome to a blind stranger 
that honourable war never teach a nobleness 
nor worthy circumstance show what a man be 
that never hear thy name sing but in banquet 
and lose lascivious pleasure to a boy 
that have no faith to comprehend thy greatness 
no study of thy life to know thy goodness 
and leave thy nation nay thy noble friend 
leave he disinherit that in tear fall with thou 
in soft relent tear hear i great Pompey 
if thy great spirit can hear I must task thou 
thou have most unnoble robe i of my victory 
my love and mercy 

o how brave these tear show 
how excellent be sorrow in a enemy 

glory appear not great than this goodness 

Egyptian dare you think your high pyramid 
build to outdare the sun as you suppose 
where your unworthy king lie rake in ash 
be monument fit for he no brood of Nilus 
nothing can cover his high fame but heaven 
no pyramid set off his memory 
but the eternal substance of his greatness 
to which I leave he take the head away 
and with the body give it noble burial 
your earth shall now be bless to hold a roman 
who bravery all the worldsearth can balance 

if thou be thus love I shall honour thou 
but great man may dissemble it be hold possible 
and be right glad of what they seem to weep for 
there be such kind of philosopher now do I wonder 
how he will look if Pompey be alive again 
but how he will set his face 

you look now king 
and you that have be agent in this glory 
for our especial favour 

we desire it 

and doubtless you expect reward 

let i give they 
I will give they such as nature never dream of 
I will beat he and his agent in a mortar 
into one man and that one man I will bake then 

peace I forgive you all that be recompense 
you be young and ignorant that plead your pardon 
and fear it may be more than hate provoke you 
your minister I must think want judgement 
and so they err I be bountiful to think this 
believe i most bountiful be you most thankful 
that bounty share among you if I know 
what to send you for a present king of Egypt 
I mean a head of equal reputation 
and that you love though it be your bright sister 
but she you hate I will not be behind you 

hear i great Cesar 

I heave hard too much 
and study not with smooth show to invade 
my noble mind as you have do my conquest 
you be poor and open I must tell you roundly

how greedy he ask from whence it come 
and what commerce we hold for such abundance

then to live high and wanton while you be secure here 
and offer hecatomb of lazy kiss

the spawn of Egypt flow about your palace 
arm all and ready to assault 

lead on 
by the false and base Photinus and his minister 
no stir out no peep through a loophole 
but straight salute with a arm dart 

no parley they be deaf to all but danger 
they swear they will flay we and then dry our quarter 
a rasher of a salt lover be such a shooinghorn 
can you kiss away this conspiracy and set we free 
or will the giant god of love fight for you 
will his fierce warlike bow kill a cocksparrow

and with her powerful look strike awe into they 
she can destroy and build again the city 
your goddess have mighty gift show they her fair breast 
the impregnable bulwark of proud love and let they 
begin their battery there she will laugh at they

to recover the fleet and bring i up two legion 
and you shall see i how I will break like thunder

I hear he be alter 
and have give away his gold to honest use 
cry monstrous 

he cry abundant 
he be blind almost with weep 

it be most wonderful 
that a hard heart man and a old soldier 
shall have so much kind moisture when his mother die 
he laugh aloud and make the wicked ballad 

it be like enough he never love his parent 
nor can I blame he for they near love he 
his mother dream before she be deliver 
that she be bring abed with a buzzard and ever after 
she whistle he up to the world his brave clothes too 
he have fling away and go like one of we now 
walk with his hand in his pocket poor and sorrowful 
and give the best instruction 

And tell story 
of honest and good people that be honour 
and how they be remember and run mad 
if he but hear of any ungrateful person 
a bloody or betray man 

if it be possible 
that a archvillain may ever be recover

to see he once again 

he spare we that labour 
for here he come

for I be yet too take for your company

Septinius that base knave that betray Pompey 

I be and be unless your honest thought 
will look upon my penitence and save i 
I must be ever villain oh good soldier 
you that have Roman heart take heed of falsehood 
take heed of blood take heed of foul ingratitude 
the god have scarce a mercy for those mischief 
take heed of pride it be that that bring i to it 

this fellow will make a rare speech at the gallows 

it be very fit he be hang to edify we 

let all your thought be humble and obedient 
love your commander honour they that feed you 
pray that you may be strong in honesty 
as in the use of arm labour and diligent 
to keep your heart from ease and her base issue 
pride and ambitious wantonness those spoil i 
rather lose all your limb than the least honesty 
you be never lame indeed till loss of credit 
benumb you through scar and those maim of honour 
be memorable crutch that shall bear 
when you be dead your noble name to eternity 

I cry 

and so do I 

a excellent villain 

a more sweet pious knave I never hear yet 

he be happy he be rascal to come to this 
who be this a priest 

o stay most holy sir 
and by the god of Egypt I conjure you 
Isis and great Osiris pity i 
pity a load man and tell i true 
with what most humble sacrifice I may 
wash off my sin and appease the power that hate i 
take from my heart those thousand thousand fury 
that restless gnaw upon my life and save i 
Orestes bloody hand fall on his mother 
yet at the holy altar he be pardon 

Orestes out of madness do his murder 
and therefore he find grace thou worst of all man 
out of cold blood and hope of gain base lucre 
slay thy own feeder come not near the altar 
nor with thy reek hand pollute the sacrifice 
thou be mark for shame eternal Exit 

look all on i 
and let i be a story leave to time 
of blood and infamy how base and ugly 
ingratitude appear with all her profit 
how monstrous my hope grace at court good soldier 
let neither flattery nor the witch sound 
of high and soft preferment touch your goodness 
to be valiant old and honest oh what blessedness 

do thou want any thing 

nothing but your prayer 

be thus and let the blind priest do his worst 
we have god as well as they and they will hear we 

Come cry no more thou have weep out twenty Pompeyes 

so penitent 

it seem so 

yet for all this 
we must employ he 

these be the arm soldierleader 
away and let we to the fort we shall be snap else Exit 

how now why thus what cause of this dejection 

why do thou weep 

pray leave i you have ruine i 
you have make i a famous villain 

do that touch thou 

he will be hard to win he feel his lewdness 

he must be win or we shall want our right hand 
this fellow dare and know and must be hearten 
be thou so poor to blench at what thou have do 
be conscience a comrade for a old soldier 

it be not that it may be some disgrace 
that be take heavy and will be cherish 
Septinius ever scorn to show such weakness 

let i alone I be not for your purpose 
I be now a new man 

we have new affair for thou 
those that will raise thy head 

I will it be offend 
and in your belly for the love you bear i 
I will be no more knave I have sting enough 
already in my breast 

thou shall be noble 
and who dare think then that thou be not honest 

thou shall command in chief all our strong force 
and if thou serve a use must not all justify it 

I be rogue enough 

thou will be more and base 
a poor rogue be all rogue open to all shame 
nothing to shadow he do thou think cry 
can keep thou from the censure of the multitude 
or to be kneel at the altar save thou 
it be poor and servile 
be thou thy own sacrifice 
it will seem so low people will spit the fire out 

keep thyself glorious still though never so stain 
and that will lessen it if not work it out 
to go complain thus and thus repent 
like a poor girl that have betray her maidenhead 

I will stop my ear 

will show so in a soldier 
so simple and so ridiculous so tame 

if people will believe thou it be some honesty 
and for thy penitence will not laugh at thou 
as sure they will and beat thou for thy poverty 
if they will allow thy foolery there be some hope 

my foolery 

nay more than that thy misery 
thy monstrous misery 

he begin to hearken 
thy misery so great man will not bury thou 

that this be true 

why do this conquer Caesar 
labour through the world deep sea of toil and trouble 
danger and desperate hope to repent afterward 
why do he slaughter thousand in a battle 
and whip his country with the sword to cry for it 
thou kill great Pompey he will kill all his kindred 
and justify it nay raise up trophy to it 
when thou hear he repent he be hold most holy too 
and cry for do daily bloody murder 
take thou example and go ask forgiveness 
call up the thing thou name thy conscience 
and let it work then it will seem well Septinius 

he do all this 

yes and be honour for it 
nay call the honour Caesar so may thou be 
thou be bear as near a crown as he 

he be poor 

and desperate bloody trick get he this credit 

I be afraid you will once more 

help to raise thou 
off with thy pine black it dull a soldier 
and put on resolution like a man 
a noble fate wait on thou 

I now feel 
myself return rascal speedy 
o that I have the power 

thou shall have all 
and do all through thy power man shall admire thou 
and the vice of Septinius shall turn virtue 

off off thou must off off my cowardice 
pule repentance off

off my deject look and welcome impudence 
my dare shall be deity to save i 
give i instruction and put action on i 
a glorious cause upon my sword point gentleman 
and let my wit and valour work you will raise i 
and make i outdare all my misery 

all this and all thy wish 

use i then 
womanish fear farewell I will never melt more 
lead on to some great thing to weal my spirit 
I cut the cedar Pompey and I will fall 
this huge oak Caesar too 

now thou sing sweet 
and Ptolemy shall crown thou for thy service exeunt 

he be well wrought put he on apace for cool 

the tumult still increase 

o my fortune 
my lustfull folly rather but it be well 
and worthy I be make a bondmans prey 
that after all my glorious victory 
in which I pass so many sea of danger 
when all the element conspire against i 
will yield up the dominion of this head 
to any mortal power so blind and stupid 
to trust these base egyptian that proclaim 
their perjury in noble Pompey death 
and yet that can not warn i 

be still Caesar 
whoever love to exercise his fate 
where danger look most dreadful 

if you fall 
fall not alone let the king and his sister 
be bury in your ruin on my life 
they both be guilty reason may assure you 
Photinus nor Achillas dare attempt you 
or shake one dart or sword aim at your safety 
without their warrant 

for the young king I know not 
how he may be miss but for his sister 
unequalled Cleopatra it be a kind 
of blasphemy to doubt she ugly treason 
dare never dwell in such a glorious building 
nor can so clear and great a spirit as she be 
admit of falsehood 

let we seize on he then 
and leave she to her fortune 

if he have power 
use it to your security and let 
his honesty acquit he if he be false 
it be too great a honour he shall die 
by your victorious hand 

he come and I 
shall do as I find cause 

let not great Caesar 
impute the breach of hospitality 
to you my guest to i I be contemn 
and my rebellious subject lift their hand 
against my head and will they aim no far 
provide that I fall a sacrifice 
to gain you safety that this be not feign 
the boldness of my innocence may confirm you 
have I be privy to their bloody plot 
I now have lead they on and give fair gloss 
to their bad cause by be present with they 
but I that yet taste of the punishment 
in be false to Pompey will not make 
a second fault to Caesar uncompelled 
with such as have not yet shake off obedience 
I yield myself to you and will take part 
in all your danger 

This plead your excuse 
and I receive it 

if they have any touch 
of justice or religion I will use 
the authority of our god to call they back 
from their bad purpose 

this part of the palace 
be yet defensible we may make it good 
till your power rescue we 

Caesar besiege 
o stain to my great action it be my custom 
a army rout as my foot have wing 
to be first in the chase nor wall nor bulwark 
can guard those that escape the battle fury 
from this strong arm and I to be enclose 
my heart my heart but it be necessity 
to which the god must yield and I obey 
till I redeem it by some glorious way exeunt 

there be no retire now we be break in 
the deed past hope of pardon if we prosper 
he will be style lawful and we shall give law 
to those that now command we stop not at 
or loyalty or duty bold ambition 
to dare and power to do give the first difference 
between the king and subject Caesar motto 
aut Caesar aut nihil each of we must claim 
and use it as our own 

the deed be bloody 
if we conclude in Ptolemy death 

the better 
the globe of empire must be so manure 

Rome that from Romulus first take her name 
have her wall water with a crimson shower 
drain from a brother heart nor be she raise 
to this prodigious height that overlook 
three full part of the earth that pay her tribute 
but by enlarge of her narrow bound 
by the sack of neighbour city be make she 
till they be cement with the blood of those 
that do possess they Cesar Ptolemy 
now I be steel to i be empty name 
esteem as Pompey be 

Well say Septinius 
thou now be right again 

but what course take we 
for the princess Cleopatra 

let she live 
a while to make we sport she shall authorise 
our undertake to the ignorant people 
as if what we do be by her command 
but our triumvirate government once confirm 
she bear her brother company that be my province 
leave i to work she 

I will undertake 
for Ptolemy 

Cesar shall be my task 
and as in Pompey I begin a name 
I will perfect it in Caesar 

it be resolve then 
we will force our passage 

see they do appear 
as they desire a parley 

I be proud yet 
I have bring they to capitulate 

now Photinus 

now Ptolemy 

no addition 

we be equal 
though Caesar name be put into the scale 
in which our worth be weigh 

presumptuous villain 
upon what ground have thou presume to raise 
thy servile hand against the king or i 
that have a great name 

on those by which 
thou do presume to pass the Rubicon 
against the law of Rome and at the name 
of traitor smile as thou do when Marcellus 
the consul with the senate full consent 
pronounce thou for a enemy to thy country 
yet thou go on and thy rebellious cause 
be crown with fair success why shall we fear then 
think on that Caesar 

o the god be brave thus 
and be compel to bear this from a slave 
that will not brook great Pompey his superior 

thy glory now have touch the high point 
and must descend 

despair and think we stand 
the champion of Rome to wreak her wrong 
upon who liberty thou have set thy foot 

and that the ghost of all those noble roman 
that by thy sword fall in this civil war 
expect revenge 

dare thou speak and remember 
there be a Pompey 

there be no hope to escape we 
if that against the odds we have upon you 
you dare come forth and fight receive the honour 
to die like roman if you faint resolve 
to starve like wretch I disdain to change exit 
another syllable with you 

let we die noble 
and rather fall upon each other sword 
then come into these villain hand 

that fortune 
which to this hour have be a friend to Caesar 
though for a while she clothe her brow with frown 
will smile again upon i who will pay she 
or sacrifice or vow if she forsake 
her best of work in i or suffer he 
who with a strong hand she have lead triumphant 
through the whole western world and Rome acknowledge 
her sovereign lord to end in glorious 
a life admire by all the threaten danger 
must by a way more horrid be avoid 
and I will run the hazard fire the palace 
and the rich magazine that neighbour it 
in which the wealth of Egypt be contain 
start not it shall be so that while the people 
labour in quench the ensue flame 
like Caesar with this handful of my friend 
through fire and sword I force a passage to 
my conquer legion king if thou dare follow 
where Caesar lead or live or die a freeman 
if not stay here a bondman to thy slave 
and dead be think unworthy of a grave exeunt 

I feel my resolution melt again 
and that I be not knave alone but fool 
in all my purpose this devil Photinus 
employ i as a property and grow useless 
will shake i off again he tell i so 
when I kill Pompey nor can I hope better 
when Caesar be dispatch service do 
for such as only study their own end 
too great to be reward or return 
with deadly hate I learn this principle 
in his own school yet still he fool i well 
and yet he trust i since I in my nature 
be fashion to be false wherefore shall I 
that kill my general and a roman one 
to who I owe all nourishment of life 
be true to a egyptian to save Caesar 
and turn Photinus plot on his own head 
as it be in my power redeem my credit 
and live to lie and swear again in fashion 
o it be a masterpiece ha my Ceasar 
how be he get off 

the fire have take 
and show the city like a second Troy 
the navy too be scorch the people greedy 
to save their wealth and house while their soldier 
make spoil of all only Achillas troop 
make good their guard break through they we be safe 
I will lead you like a thunderbolt 

stay Caesar 

who be this the dog Septinius 

cut his throat 

you bark but now fawn you so soon 

o hear i 
what I will deliver be for Caesar safety 
for all your good 

good from a month like thou 
that never belch but blasphemy and treason on festival day 

I be a alter man alter indeed 
and I will give you cause to say I be a roman 

rogue I grant thou 

trust i I will make the passage smooth and easy 
for your escape 

I will trust the devil soon 
and make a safe bargain 

I be trust 
with all Photinus secret 

there be no doubt then 
thou will be false 

still to be true to you 

and very likely 

be brief the mean 

thus Caesar 
to i alone but bind by terrible oath 
not to discover it he have reveal 
a dismal vault who dreadful mouth do open 
a mile beyond the city in this cave 
lie but two hour conceal 

if you believe he 
he will bury we alive 

I will fly in the air first 

then in the dead of night I will bring you back 
into a private room where you shall find 
Photinus and Achillas and the rest 
of their commander close at counsel 

good what follow 

fall i fair on their throat 
their head cut off and shear the multitude 
will easy disperse 

o devil away with he 
nor true to friend nor enemy Caesar scorn 
to find his safety or revenge his wrong 
so base a way or owe the mean of life 
to such a leprous traitor I have tower 
for victory like a falcon in the cloud 
not dig for it like a mole our sword and cause 
make way for we and that it may appear 
we take a noble course and hate base treason 
some soldier that will merit Caesar favour 
hang he on yonder turret and then follow 
the lane this sword make for you Exit 

here be a belt 
though I die for it I will use it 

it be too good 
to truss a cur in 

save i here be gold 

if Rome 
be offer for thy ransom it can not help thou 

hang not a arse 

goad he on with thy sword 
thou do deserve a worse end and may 
all such conclude so that their friend betray 

we be lose 

undo 

confusion fire and sword 
and fury in the soldier face more horrid 
circle we round 

the king command they laugh at 
and jeer at Caesar threat 

my brother seize on 
by the roman as think guilty of the tumult 
and force to bear he company as mark out 
for his protection or revenge 

they have break 
into my cabinet my trunk be ransack 

I have lose my jewel too but that be the least 
the barbarous rascal against all humanity 
or sense of pity have kill my little dog 
and break my monkey chain 

they ruffle i 
but that I can endure and tire they too 
will they proceed no further 

o my sister 

my queen my mistress 

can you stand unmoved 
when a earthquake of rebellion shake the city 
and the court tremble 

yes Arsino 
and with a masculine constancy deride 
fortune worst malice as a servant to 
my virtue not a mistress than we forsake 
the strong vv of ourselves when we once yield 
or shrink at her assault I be still myself 
and though disrobe of sovereignty and ravish 
of ceremonious duty that attend it 
nay grant they have slave my body my free mind 
like to the palmtree wall fruitful Nile 
shall grow up straight and enlarge itself 
spite of the envious weight that load it with 
think of thy birth Arsino common burden 
fit common shoulder teach the multitude 
by suffer noble what they fear to touch at 
the greatness of thy mind do soar a pitch 
their dim eye darken by their narrow soul 
can arrive at 

I be new create 
and owe this second being to you best sister 
for now I feel you have infuse into i 
part of your fortitude 

I still be fearful 
I dare not tell a lie you that be bear 
daughter and sister unto king may nourish 
great thought which I that be your humble handmaid 
must not presume to rival 

yet my Eros 
though thou have profit nothing by observe 
the whole course of my life learn in my death 
though not to equal yet to imitate 
thy fearless mistress 

o a man in arm 
his weapon draw too 

though upon the point 
death sit I will meet it and outdare the danger 

Keep the watch strong and guard the passage sure 
that lead unto the sea 

what sea of rudeness 
break in upon we or what subject breath 
dare raise a storm when we command a calm 
be duty and obedience flee to heaven 
and in their room ambition and pride 
send into Aegyt that face speak thou Photinus 
a thing thy mother bring into the world 
my brother and my slave but thy behaviour 
oppose to that a insolent intruder 
upon that sovereignty thou shall bow to 
if in the gulf of base ingratitude 
all loyalty to Ptolemy the king 
be swallow up remember who I be 
who daughter and who sister or suppose 
that be forget too let the name of Caesar 
which nation quake at stop the desperate madness 
from run headlong on to thy confusion 
throw from thou quick those rebellious arm 
and let i read submission in thy eye 
thy wrong to we we will not only pardon 
but be a ready advocate to plead for thou 
to Caesar and my brother 

plead my pardon 
to you I bow but scorn as much to stoop thus 
to Ptolemy to Caesar nay the god 
as to put off the figure of a man 
and change my essence with a sensual beast 
all my design my counsel and dark end 
be aim to purchase you 

How dare thou be 
the scorn of baseness nourish such a thought 

they that have power be royal and those base 
that live at the devotion of another 
what birth give Ptolemy or fortune Caesar 
by engine fashion in this protean anvil 
I have make i and only stoop at you 
who I will still preserve free to command i 
for Caesar frown they be below my thought 
and but in these fair eye I still have read 
the story of a supreme monarchy 
to which all heart with i glad pay tribute 
Photinus name have long since be as great 
as Ptolemy ever be or Caesar be 
this make i as a weak tie to unloose 
the knot of loyalty that chain my freedom 
and slight the fear that Caesar threat may cause 
that I and they may see no sun appear 
but Cleopatra in the egyptian sphere 

o giantlike ambition marry to 
Cimmerian darkness in considerate fool 
though flatter with self love can thou believe 
be all crown on the earth make into one 
and that by king set on thy head all sceptre 
within thy grasp and lay down at my foot 
I will vouchsafe a kiss to a noman 
a geld eunuch 

fair that make for i 
and show it be no sensual appetite 
but true love to the greatness of thy spirit 
that when that you be i shall yield i pleasure 
Hymen though bless a new marry pair 
shall blush to think on and our certain issue 
the glorious splendour of dread majesty 
who beam shall dazzle Rome and awe the world 
my want in that kind other shall supply 
and I give way to it 

base than thy birth 
can there be god and hear this and no thunder 
ram thou into the earth 

they be asleep 
and can hear thou 
or with open eye 
do Jove look on we I will laugh and swear 
that his artillery be cloy by i 
or if that they have power to hurt his bolt 
be in my hand 

most impious 

they be dream 
religious fool shake at yet to assure thou 
if Nemesis that scourge pride and scorn 
be any thing but a name she live in i 
for by myself a oath to i more dreadful 
than Styx be to your god weak Ptolemy dead 
and Caesar both be in my toil remove 
the poor rascal that be in my camp 
shall in my presence quench their justful heat 
in thou and young Arsinoe while I laugh 
to hear you howl in vain 
I deride those god 
that you think can protect you 

to prevent thou 
in that I be the mistress of my fate 
so hope I of my sister to confirm it 
I spit at thou and scorn thou 

I will tame 
that haughty courage and make it stoop too 

never 
I be bear to command and I will die so 

the king dead this be a fair entrance to 
our future happiness 

o my dear brother 

weep not Arsinoe common woman do so 
nor lose a tear for he it can help he 
but study to die noble 

Caesar flee 
it be deadly aconite to my cold heart 
it choke my vital spirit where be your care 
do the guard sleep 

he rouse they with his sword 
we talk of Mars but I be sure his courage 
admit of no comparison but itself 
and as inspire by he his follow friend 
with such a confidence as you eaglets prey 
under the large wing of their fierce dam 
break through our troop and scatter they he go on 
but still pursue by we when on the sudden 
he turn his head and from his eye fly terror 
which strike in we no less fear and amazement 
then if we have encounter with the lightning 
hurl from Jove cloudy brow 

it be like my Caesar 

we fall back he make on and as our fear 
have part from we with his dreadful look 
again we follow but get near the sea 
on which his navy anchor in one hand 
hold a scroll he have above the wave 
and in the other grasp fast his sword 
as it have be a trident forge by Vulcan 
to calm the rage ocean he make away 
as if he have be neptune his friend like 
so many Triton follow their bold shout 
yield a cheerful music we shower dart 
upon they but in vain they reach their ship 
and in their safety we be sink for Caesar 
prepare for war 

How fall the king 

unable 
to follow Caesar he be tread to death 
by the pursuer and with he the priest 
of Isis good Achoreus 

May the earth 
lie gentle on their ash 

I feel now 
that there be power above we and that it be not 
within the search policy of man 
to alter their decree 

I laugh at thou 
where be thy threat now fool thy scoff and scorn 
against the god I see calamity 
be the best mistress of religion 
and can convert a atheist 

o they come 
mountain fall on i o for he to die 
that place his heaven on earth be a assurance 
of his descent to hell where shall I hide i 
the great dare to a man dishonest 
be but a bastard courage ever faint Exit 

look on your Caesar banish fear my fair you now be safe 

by Venus not a kiss 
till our work be do the traitor once dispatch 
to it and we will cry aim 

I will be speedy exeunt 

farewell again Arsinoe how now Eros 
ever fainthearted 

but that I be assure 
your excellency can command the general 
I fear the soldier for they look as if 
they will be nibble too 

he be all honour 
nor do I now repent i of my favour 
nor can I think nature ever make a woman 
that in her prime deserve he 

he be come back 
pursue no far curb the soldier fury 
see beauteous mistress their accurse head 
that do conspire against we 

fury plague they 
they have too fair a end to die like soldier 
Pompey fall by the sword the cross or halter 
shall have dispatch they 

all be but death good Sceva 
be therefore satisfy and now my dear 
look up on Caesar as he still appear 
a conqueror and this unfortunate king 
entomb with honour we will for Rome where Caesar 
will show he can give kingdom for the senate 
thy brother dead shall willing decree 
the crown of Egypt that be his to thou
