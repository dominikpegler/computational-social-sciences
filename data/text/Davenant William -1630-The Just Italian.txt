he do which I 
over hear and force a passage to his heart 
from its warm throne I snatch the ache lump 
and throw it straight unto a hungry fiend 

be he dead too the genius of the world 
be sick all form must cease 

do weep for he 

o sir shall I restrain the flux my eye 
will drop from their loose string instead of tear 

this obsequy do make compassion sin 

o Sciolto be thou so early flee 
to taste eternity and unknown fate 

stint thy hoarse dirge pernicious whore I have 
some hope the interview that you enjoy 
may be enforce by his unruly strength 
but now I find it be with thy consent 
procure you have struggle in each other lust

my hand I do not bathe in humane blood 
Alteza and Sciolto be alive 

this joy will make my heart dance in my breast 

sink into the earth where sorrow dwell ere yond 
dim morn shall add one hour unto her age

with thou my anger be so just I will 
not prosecute thy life until my doubt 
be clear go go and number over thy bead

with Gaul that from our mother be derive 
and so may tempt compassion from your breast 

Alteza mourn as if to expiate 
a nation with her grief have thou reveal 
such penitence it may have soften my 
decree but thou be sour and stern of soul

the figure on her tomb spend her last breath 
in praise of thou quoth she for my sake use 
thy sister well the acqaintance that she have

on deed but now they cheapen blood it be spill 
to punish the example not the guilt

grow like the cedar big and high but yield 
no fruit the abject race of man she do 
confound with hope and bid they not obey 
to augment humility but her own sway Exit

spit fire till I enkindle yonder grove 
raise a flame that may perplex the earth 
and make they think heaven have drop a planet 

and I can weep until I quench that flame 
and draw suspicion that a second flood 
be come to drown mortality again 

this sudden elevation of the soul 
presage death as if it practise how 
to rise and climb ere she begin her flight 

whence be that noise

disguise though it proceed more from hope 
to enjoy your person then your wealth witness

grant now thou beauteous wealth of Italy 
a expiation for my crime for know 
I will be clean when I shall dedicate 
my future vow to the absent altar of

with scorn I know you lady most delight 
in the frail surface of the body in name 
and guild pomp which be the fatal cause 
I practise they on you

of fashion unto we by make it 
a custom in yourselves if man do not 
provide such folly for our sight we know 
not where to find their use for they digest 
they first than they become our nourishment

with female shape that heaven scarce know its stamp 
and nature that distinction still command 
to each sex forget the work of her own hand 

I never behold a feature masculine 
till now have you but thus appear unto 
my first survey I may have love in haste 
and yet excuse the rashness of my eye 
I begin to feel some danger in my stay 

ere you depart a small memorial from

that it may tempt kind fate to look on i 
when I in glorious battle strive and 
I will absent myself for evermore 

i nothing keep for such sad use as to 
deprive i of so sweet a miracle 

grant my request or I will pursue your step 

if you continue still to beg I fear 
my bounty will prove rash and I shall give 
so much of love as you can never repay 

o my auspicious star shall I not now 
make use of your good influence I be 
unworthy of your care enter meruolle 

the choice you make 
can never deserve your chaste and lawful fire

continue a dislike of she I will blow thou from 
my memory and with my chief strength 
I will punish thy mistake 

a desolate grief 
will more become thy breast then this proud rage

her sister pride 

my sister husband dead

that have already stiffen every hair 
on my amaze skull into a reed 

will thou neglect to cherish the swift growth 
of our new love 

like to her sister she 
but counterfeit a passionate esteem 
that thy fond nature she may tempt beneath 
her rule if Altamont be dear unto 
thy thought leave she and straight attend his hearse 
that in the chapel wait thy obsequy Exit 

the inspire needle be not more true unto 
the north the sun to his diurnal race 
nor river to the main then I to thou 

sorrow and love my sense do divide 
if I remain with thou then only love

unto my brother hearse I both obey Exit 

thou do requite the scorn which I do throw 
on thy first love my destiny must needs 
be tragic now since the contract scope 
of all my joy rest in disease hope Exit 

behold the throne your lord command i 
prepare and here you must be please to sit 

can this advancement aught refer to your 
delight or to my lord last testament

or sacrifice bring the delinquent in 

Sciolto and Scoperta still alive

the love of all my chief orison 

these two be by your husband jealousy 
and hate ordain for death but ere that we 
can actuate his will his noble breast

permit this utterance clear his faith madam 
you hear that he Scoperta vindicate 
by oath though his own crime do carry a 
import more evident and black but yet

she be i bow and do homage to her lip 

still thou do mourn Alteza like a dove soft music 
hark hark how the romanorgan seem 
to invoke the thracian lyre the cymbal of 
judea call castiliancornet forth 
and germanviol wake the tuscan lute 
the sacred noise attend that while we hear 
our soul may dance into each other ear
