will give i game upon he yet he be so foul 
one will scarce touch with a sword he love 
and make account of so most deadly venomous 
he will go never to poison any weapon

to infect my blood

gild must not walk so near his lodge again 
he come never i now 

all league with mankind I renounce for ever 
till I find this murderer not so much 
as common courtesy but I will lock up 
for in the state of ignorance I live in 
a brother may salute his brother murderer 
and wish good speed to the villain in a greeting

the dead again or in their room to give 
brother a new brother father a child 
if these appear all grief be reconcile
