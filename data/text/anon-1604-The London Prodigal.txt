brother from Venice be thus disguise 
I come to prove the humour of my son 
how have he bear himself since my departure 
I leave you his patron and his guide 

i'faith brother so as you will grieve to hear 
and I almost ashamed to report it 

why how be it brother what do he spend 
beyond the allowance I leave he 

how beyond that and far more why your exhibition be nothing he have spend that and since have borrow protest with oath allege kindred to wring money from i by the love I bear his father by the fortune may fall upon himself to furnish his want that do I have have since his bond his friend and friend bond although I know that he spend be you yet it grieve i to see the unbridle wildness that reign over he 

brother what be the manner of his life how be the name of his offence if they do not relish altogether of damnation his youth may privilege his wantonness I myself run a unbridle course till thirty nay almost till forty well you see how I be for vice once look into with the eye of discretion and well balance with the waits of reason the course past seem so abominable that the landlord of himself which be the heart of his body will rather entomb himself in the earth or seek a new tenant to remain in he which once settle how much better be they that in their youth have know all these vice and leave it than those that know little and in their age run into it believe i brother they that die most virtuous have in their youth live most vicious and none know the danger of the fire more than he that fall into it but say how be the course of his life let we hear his particular 

why I will tell you brother he be a continual swearer 
and a breaker of his oath which be bad 

I grant indeed to swear be bad but not in keep those oath be better for who will set by a bad thing 
nay by my faith I hold this rather a virtue than a vice 
well I pray proceed 

he be a mighty brawler and come common by the worst 

by my faith this be none of the worst neither for if he brawl and be beat for it it will in time make he shun it for what bring man or child more to virtue than correction what reign over he else 

he be a great drinker and one that will forget himself 

o best of all vice shall be forget let he drink on 
so he drink not church 
nay and this be the worst I hold it rather a happiness in he 
than any iniquity have he any more attendant 

brother he be one that will borrow of any man 

why you see so do the sea it borrow of all the small 
current in the world to increase himself 

ay but the sea pay it again and so will never your son 

no more will the sea neither if it be as dry as my son 

then brother I see you rather like these vice in your son 
than any way condemn they 

nay mistake i not brother for though I slur they over now 
as thing slight and nothing his crime be in the bud 
it will gall my heart they shall ever reign in he 

ho who be within ho 

that be your son he be come to borrow more money 

for Godsake give it out I be dead see how he will take it 
say I have bring you news from his father 
I have here draw a formal will as it be from myself 
which I will deliver he

a pestilent humane fellow I have make 
certain annotation of he such as they be 
and how be it sir Lancelot ha how sir 
a mad world man can live quiet in it 

master Flowerdale I do understand there be some jar 
between the Devonshire man and you 

they sir they be good friend as can be 

who master Oliver and I as good friend as can be 

it be a kind of safety in you to deny it and a generous 
silence which too few be induce withal but sir such 
a thing I hear and I can wish it otherwise 

no such thing sir Lancelot a my reputation 
as I be a honest man 

now I do believe you then if you do 
engage your reputation there be none 

nay I do not engage my reputation there be not 
you shall not bind i to any condition of hardness 
but if there be any thing between we then there be 
if there be not than there be not be or be not all be one 

I do perceive by this that there be something between you and I be very sorry for it

that way which I must ride no man must deny 
i the sun I will not by any particular man 
be deny common and general passage if any one 
say Flowerdale thou pass not this way 
my answer be I must either on or return 
but return be not my word I must on 
if I can then make my way nature 
have do the last for i and there be the fine 

master Flowerdale every man have one tongue 
and two ear nature in her build 
Is a most curious workmaster 

that be as much to say a man shall hear more 
than he shall speak 

you say true and indeed I have hear more 
than at this time I will speak 

you say well 

slander be more common than troth master Flowerdale 
but proof be the rule for both 

you say true what do you call he 
have it there in his three canton 

I have hear you have be wild I have believe it 

it be fit it be necessary 

but I have see somewhat of late in you 
that have confirm in i a opinion of 
goodness towards you 

i'faith sir I be sure I never do you harm 
some good I have do either to you or you 
I be sure you know not neither be it my will you shall 

I your will sir

begod and you do sir I be abuse 

go master Flowerdale what I know I know 
and know you thus much out of my knowledge 
that I true love you for my daughter 
she you and if you like a marriage better 
then a brawl all quirk of reputation set aside go with i present and where you shall fight a bloody battle you shall be marry to a lovely lady 

nay but sir Lancelot 

if you will not embrace my offer yet assure yourself thus much I will have order to hinder your encounter 

nay but hear i sir Lancelot 

nay stand not you upon imputative honour 
it be mere unsound unprofitable and idle 
inference your business be to wed my daughter therefore give i your present word to do it I will go and provide the maid therefore give i your present resolution either now or never 

will you so put i too it 

I afore God either take i now or take i never 
else what I think shall be our match shall be our part 
so fare you well for ever

in mirth we will spend 
full many a merry hour 
as for this wench I not regard a pin 
it be her gold must bring my pleasure in 

be it possible he have his second live 
forsake God himself to the devil give 
but that I know his mother firm and chaste 
my heart will say my head she have disgrace 
else will I swear he never be my son 
but her fair mind so foul a deed do shun 

how now brother how do you find your son 

o brother heedless as a libertine 
even grow a master in the school of vice 
one that do nothing but invent deceit 
for all the day he humour up and down 
how he the next day 〈◊〉 〈◊〉 his friend 
he think of nothing but the present time 
for one groat ready down he will pay a shilling 
but then the lender must needs stay for it 
when I be young I have the scope of youth 
both wild and wanton careless and desperate 
but such mad strain as he be possess withal 
I think it wonder for to dream upon 

I tell you so but you will not believe it 

well I have find it but one thing comfort i 
brother tomorrow he be to be marry 
to beauteous Luce sir Lancelot Spurcock daughter 

be it possible

if any thing will tame he it must be that 
for he be rank in mischief chain to a life 
that will increase his shame and kill his wife 

what arrest he on his wedding day

how many couple even for that very day 
have purchase year sorrow afterward 
forbear he then today do it tomorrow 
and this day mingle not his joy with sorrow 

brother I will ha● it do this very day 
and in the view of all as he come from church
