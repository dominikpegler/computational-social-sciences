make thyself less Philotas than thou be 
what mean my father thus to write to i 
less than I be in what how can that be 
must I be then set underneath my heart 
shall I let go the hold I have of grace 
gain with so hard adventure of my blood 
and suffer other mount into my place 
and from below look up to where I stand 
shall I degrade the opinion of my worth 
by put off employment as undo 
in spirit or grace while other man set forth 
to get that start of action I have win 
as if such man as I have any place 
to stay betwixt their ruin and their grace 
can any go beyond i but they will 
go over i and trample on my state 
and make their fortune good upon my ill 
while fear have power to wound i worse than hate 

Philotas you deceive yourself in this 
your father mean not you shall yield in place 
but in your popular dependence 
your entertainment guife and public grace 
that do in jealous king distaste the peer 
and make you not the great but in fear 

alas what popular dependence 
do I retain can I shake off the zeal 
of such as do out of their kindness 
follow my fortune in the commonweal 

Indeed Philotas therein you say true 
they follow do your fortune and not you 

yea but I find their love to i sincere 

Even such as to the wolf the fox do bear 
that visit he but to partake his prey 
and see his hope deceive turn to betray 

I know they will if I in danger stand 
run unto i with hazard of their blood 

yea like as man to burn house run 
not to lend aid but to be looker on 

but I with bounty and with gift have tie 
their heart so sure I know they will not slide 

bounty and gift lose more than they do find 
where many look for good few have their mind 
each think he merit more than than he have 
and so gift lay for love do catch man wrath 

but many mere out of love attend 

yea those that love and have no other end 
think you that man can love you when they know 
you have they not for friendship but for show 
and as you be engage in your affair 
and have your end think likewise they have they 

but I do true from my heart affect 
virtue and worth where I do find it set 
beside my foe do force i in effect 
to make my party of opinion great 
and I must arm i thus against their scorn 
man must be shod that go among the thorn 

ah good Philotas you yourself be guile 
it be not the way to quench the fire with oil 
the meek and humble lamb with small ado 
suck his own dam we see and other too 
in court man long live and keep their rank 
by take injury and give thanks 

and be it so then never be these hair 
like to attain that sober hue of grey 
I can plaster and disguise my affair 
in other colour then my heart do lay 
nor can I patient endure this fond 
and strange proceed of authority 
that have engross up all into their hand 
by idolize feeble majesty 
and impious do labour all they can 
to make the king forget he be a man 
while they divide the spoil and pray of power 
and none at all respect the public good 
those hand that guard and get we what be our 
the soldiery engage to vent their blood 
in worse case seem then Pallas oldgrown moil 
the athenian foster at their public cost 
for these poor soul consume with tedious toil 
remain neglect have do their most 
and nothing shall bring home of all these war 
but empty age and body charge with scar 

Philotas all this public care I fear 
be but some private touch of your dislike 
who see your own design not stand to square 
with your desire no other course like 
the grief you take thing be not order well 
be that you feel yourself I fear not well 
but when your fortune shall stand parallel 
with those you envy now all will be well 
for you great man I see be never more 
your end attain the same you be before 
you with a finger can point out the stain 
of other error now and now condemn 
the train of state while your desire remain 
without but once get in you jump with they 
and interleague you with iniquity 
and with a like neglect do temporize 
and only serve your own commodity 
your fortune then view thing with other eye 
for either greatness do transform the heart 
into other shape of thought or certain 
this vulgar honesty do dwell apart 
from power and be some private quality 
or rather those fair part which we esteem 
in such as you be not the same they seem 
you double with yourselves or else with we 
and therefore now Philotas even as good 
to embrace the time as swell and do no good 

Alas Chalisthenes you have not lay 
true level to my nature but be wide 
from what I be within all you have say 
shall never make i of another side 
then that I be and I do scorn to climb 
by shake hand with this unworthy time 

the time Philotas then will break thy neck 

they dare nor friend my faith will keep my neck 
my service to the state have caution 
so sure for my honour as it shall 
make good the place my deed have purchase 
with danger in the love and heart of all 

those service will serve as weight to charge 
and press you unto death if your foot fail 
never so little underneath your charge 
and will be deem donne for your own avail 
and who have spirit to do the great good 
may do most hurt if they remain not good 

tush they can want my service in the state 

these time want not man to supply the state 

I fear not while parmenio force stand 

water far off quench not fire near hand 
you may be fair dispatch ere he can hear 
or if he hear before he can be here 
and therefore do not build upon such sand 
it will deceive your hope when all be do 
for though you be the minion of the land 
if you break out be sure you be undo 
when run with the current of the state 
be you the weak man of man alive 
and in convention and in counsel sit 
and do but sleep or nod yet shall you thrive 
these motive spirit be never fit to rise 
and it be a danger to be hold so wise 

what call you run with the slate shall I 
combine with those that do abuse the slate 
who want of judgement wit and honesty 
I be ashamed to see and see hate 

tush tush my lord think not of what be fit 
the world be govern more by form than wit 
he that will fret at lord and at the rain 
be but a fool and grieve himself in vain 
can you great man suffer other to 
have part in rule but must have all to do 
now good my lord conform you to the rest 
let not your wing be great than your nest 

solus see how these vain discursive bookman talk 
out of those shadow of their airy power 
and do not see how much they must defalk 
of their accompt to make they agree with we 
they little know to what necessity 
our course stand ally or how we be 
engage in reputation otherwise 
to be ourselves in our particular 
they think we can command our heart to lie 
out of their place and still they preach to we 
packbearing patience that base property 
and silly guilt of they all endure ass 
but let they talk their fill it be but wind 
I must sail by the compass of my mind 
my lord the king call for you come my lord away 

well then I know there be some new stratagem 
in hand to be consult on today 
that I be send for with such speed to he 
who youth and fortune can brook delay 
but here be a suitor stand to impeach my haste 
I will I have go up the privy way 
whereby we escape the attend multitude 
though I confess that in humanity 
it be better to deny than to delude 
my lord Philotas I be come with news 
of great importance that concern we all 
and well have my good fortune meet with you 
who best can hear and best discharge my care 

Say what it be and prithee friend be brief

swear to be secret and to keep it close 
when Dymnus tell he that within three day 
there shall be effect a conspiracy 
on Alexander person by his mean 
and diverse more of the nobility 
to free their labour and redeem they home 
which when Nichomacus my brother hear 
be this your tale say he o God forbid 
my oath shall tie my tongue to keep in this 
this ugly sin of treason which to tell 
my oath compel i faith against my faith 
must not be keep my falsehood here be truth 
and I must tell friend or friend not I will tell 
Dymnus amaze hear beyond conceit 
the selfwilled youth vow to reveal their plot 
stand stare on he draw back his breath 
or else his breath confound with his thought 
busy with death and horror can not work 
not have leisure now to think what be 
but what will be his fear be run before 
and at misfortune ere she come to he 
at length yet when his reason have reduce 
his fly thought back to some certain stand 
perceive yet some distance be betwixt 
death and his fear which give he time to work 
with his return spirit he draw his sword 
put it to his own then to my brother throat 
then lay it down then wring his hand then kneel 
then steadfast look then take he in his arm 
weep on his neck no word but oh will thou

And find no relent in the youth 
his misery grow furious and again 
he take his sword and swear to sacrifice 
to silence and their cause his dear blood 
the boy amaze see no other way 
be fain to vow and promise secrecy 
and as if win to allow and take that part 
pray he to tell who be his complice 
which though perplex with grief for what be do 
yet think now to have gain he to his side 
Dymnus reply no worse than loceus 
Demetrius of the privy chamber and 
Nicanor Amyntas and Archelopis 
drocenus aphebetus Luculaus 
shall be the associate of Nichomacus 
This when my brother once have understand 
and after much ado have get away 
he come and tell i all the whole discourse 
which here I have relate unto you 
and here will I attend to avouch the same 
or bring my brother to confirm as much 
who now I leave behind lest the conspirator 
see he here unusing to this place 
suspect to be appeach may shift away 

well fellow I have hear thy strange report 
and will find time to acquaint the king therewith 

what can a free estate afford i more 
than my incaptive fortune do allow 
be I belove enrich and grace before 
be I not love enrich and grace now 

yea but before thou be a king delight 

I may be his although he be not i 

his greatness make thou great in man sight 

more great perhaps without but not within 
my love be then above i I be now 
above my love Darius then have thousand more 
Philotas have but i as I do know 
nor none else will he have and so he swear 

nay then you may believe he if he swear 
alas poor soul she never come to know 
her liberty nor lover perjury 

stand I not better with a mean love 
that be alone to i then with these power 
who out of all proportion must be above 
and have we they but they will not be we 
and Thais although thou be a grecian 
and I a persian do not envy i 
that I embrace the only gallant man 
Persia or Greece or all the world can see 
thou who be entertain and grace by all 
the flower of honour else do not despise 
that unto i poor captive shall befall 
so great a grace in such a worthy eye 

I envy not thy love 
but think thou bless to enjoy he in that sort 
but tell i true do thou ever prove 
whether he love in earnest or in sport 

let I a little glory in my grace 
out of the passion of the joy I feel 
and tell thou a secret but in any case 
as you be a woman do not it reveal 
one day as I be fit all alone 
in come Philotas from a victory 
all blood and dust yet jolly have win 
the glory of the day most gallant 
And warm with honour of his good success 
relate to i the danger he be in 
whereat I wonder blame his forwardness 
faith wench say he thus must we fight toil win 
to make that youngman proud thus be he bear 
upon the wing of our desert our blood 
set he above himself and make he scorn 
his own his country and the author of his good 
my father be the first that out from Greece 
show he the way of Asia set he on 
and by his project raise the great piece 
of this proud work which now he tread upon 
Parmenio without Alexander much have wrought 
without Parmenio Alexander have do nought 
but let he use his fortune while he may 
time have their change we must not still be lead 
and sweet Antigona thou may one day 
yet bless the hour to have know Philotas bed 
wherewith he sweet kiss i and now deem 
if that so great so wise so rare a man 
will if he hold i not in dear esteem 
have utter this to a captive persian 
but Thais I may no long stay for fear 
my lord return and find i not within 
who eye yet never see i anywhere 
but in his chamber where I shall have be 
and therefore Thais farewell 

fare well Antigona 
now have I that which I desire long 
lay in my lap by this fond woman here 
and mean to avenge i of a secret wrong 
that do concern my reputation near 
this gallant man who this fool in this wise 
vaunt to be she I must confess to have love 
and use all the engine of these conquer eye 
affection in his highbuilt heart to have move 
yet never can for what my labour seek 
I see be lose upon vain ignorance 
while he that be the glory of the greek 
virtue upholder honour countenance 
out of this garnish of his worthy part 
be fall upon this foolish persian 
to who his secret grave he impart 
which she as wise keep and govern can 
it be strange to see the humour of these man 
these great aspire spirit that shall be wise 
we woman shall know all for now and then 
out of the humour of their jollity 
the smoke of their ambition must have vent 
and out it come what rack shall not reveal 
for this her humour have so much of wind 
that it will burst itself if too close pen 
and none more fit than we their wisdom find 
who will for love or want of wit conceal 
for be the nature of great spirit to love 
to be where they may be most eminent 
and rate of themselves so far above 
we in conceit with who they do frequent 
imagine how we wonder and esteem 
all that they do or say which make they strive 
to make our admiration more extreme 
which they suppose they can less they give 
notice of their extreme and high thought 
and then the opinion that we love they too 
beggar a confidence of secrecy 
whereby whatever they intend to do 
we shall be sure to know it present 
but faith I scorn that such a one as she 
a silly witted wench shall have this grace 
to be prefer and honour before i 
have but only beauty and a face 
I that be ever court by the great 
and gallant peer and prince of the east 
who Alexander in the great state 
the earth do ever see he make his guest 
there where this tongue obtain for her merit 
eternity of fame there where these hand 
do write in fire the glory of my spirit 
and set a trophy that for ever stand 
Thais action with the grecian act shall be 
enregister alike Thaeis she that fire 
the stately palace the earth do ever see 
Darius house that to the cloud aspire 
she be put back behind Antigona 
but soon Philotas shall his error see 
who think that beauty best man passion fit 
for that they use our body not our wit 
and unto Craterus will I present 
and he acquaint with all this who discourse 
who I be sure will take it well of we 
for these great minion who with envious eye 
look on each other greatness will be glad 
in such a case of this importancy 
to have the advantage that may here be have 

we as the chorus of the vulgar stand 
spectator here to see these great man play 
their part both of obedience and command 
and censure all they do and all they say 
for though we be esteem but ignorant 
yet be we capable of truth and know 
where they do well and where their action want 
the grace that make they prove the best in show 
and though we know not what they do within 
where they attire their mystery of state 
yet know we by the event what plot have be 
and how they all without do personate 
we see who well a mean part become 
fail in a great and disgrace the same 
we see some worthy of advancement deem 
save when they have it some again have get 
good reputation and be well esteem 
in place of greatness which before be not 
we see affliction act a better scene 
then prosperous fortune which have mar it clean 
we see that all which we have praise in some 
have only be their fortune not desert 
some war have grace who peace do ill become 
and lustful ease have blemish all their part 
we see Philotas act his goodness ill 
and make his passion to report of he 
worse than he be and we do fear he will 
bring his free nature to be entrap by they 
for sure there be some engine close lay 
against his grace and greatness with the king 
and that unless his humour prove more stay 
we soon shall see his utter ruine 
and his affliction our compassion draw 
which still look on man fortune not the cause 

EPhestion thou do Alexander love 
Craterus thou the king yet both you meet 
in oneself point of loyalty and love 
and both I find like careful like discreet 
therefore my faithful counsellor to you 
I must a weighty accident impart 
which lie so heavy as I tell you true 
I find the burden much to oppress my heart 
ingratitude and stubborn carriage 
in one of who my love deserve respect 
be that which move my passion into rage 
and be a thing I ought not to neglect 
you see how I Philotas raise have 
above his rank his peer beyond his term 
you see the place the office I give 
as the earnest of my love to bind his firm 
but all he deem rather his desert 
than the effect of my grace any way 
begin to play most peremptory part 
as fit to control then to obey 
and I have be inform he foster too 
the faction of that homebent cowardice 
that will run back from glory and undo 
all the whole wonder of our enterprise 
and one day to ourself presume to write 
seem our style and title to upbraid 
which the oracle themselves hold requisite 
and which not I but man on i have lay 
and say he pity those who under he shall live 
who hold himself the son of jupiter 
alas good man as though what breath can give 
can make my own thought other than they be 
I that be arbiter betwixt my heart 
and their opinion know how it stand within 
and find that my infirmity take part 
of that same frailty other man live in 
and yet what if I be dispose to wink 
at the entertain opinion spread so far 
and rather be content the world shall think 
we other than we be then what we be 
in do which I know I be not go 
beyond example see that majesty 
need all the prop of admiration 
that may be get to bear it up on high 
and much more my which but even now begin 
by miracle of fortune and our worth 
needs all the compliment to rest upon 
that reverence and opinion can bring forth 
which this wise man conceive not and yet take 
upon he to instruct we what to do 
but these be but the flourish he make 
of great malice he be bend unto 
for sure methinks I view within his face 
the map of change and innovation 
I see his pride content with no place 
unless it be the throne I sit upon 

have I not hear this from your sacred tongue 
dear sovereign I will never have believe 
Philotas folly will have do that wrong 
to his own worth and the honour he receive 
and yet methinks of late his carriage 
in such exceed pomp and gallantry 
and such a world of follower do presage 
that he affect popularity 
especial since for his service do 
he be adjudge to have the second place 
in honour with Antigonus which win 
to some the opinion to be high in grace 
then this last action lead the right wing 
and the overthrow he give may hap enlarge 
the opinion of himself consider 
the especial grace and honour of his charge 
whereby perhaps in rate his own worth 
his pride may undervalue that great grace 
from whence it grow and that which put he forth 
And make his fortune suit to the place 
but yet I think he be not so unwise 
although his fortune youth and jollity 
make he thus mad as he will enterprise 
aught against course his faith and loyalty 
and therefore if your grace do but withdraw 
those beam of favour which do daze his want 
he will be soon reduce to his rank of awe 
and know himself and bear he as befit 

withdraw our grace and how can that be do 
without some sollevation to ensue 
can he be safe bring in be so far go 
I hold it not say Craterus what think you 

sovereign I know the man I find his spirit 
and malice shall not make i I protest 
speak other than I know his pride do merit 
and what I speak be for your interest 
which long ere this I will have utter 
but that I fear your majesty will take 
that from some private grudge it rather breed 
then out of care for your dear sister sake 
or rather that I seek to cross your grace 
or to confine your favour within bound 
and find he to hold so high a place 
in that divine conceit which we confound 
I think the safe way to let it rest 
in hope that time some passage open will 
to let in those clear look into that breast 
that do but malice and confusion hold 
and now I see you have discern the man 
who I protest I hold most dangerous 
and that you ought with all the speed you can 
work to repress a spirit so mutinous 
for even already he be swell so high 
that his affection overflow the brim 
of his own power not able to deny 
passage unto the thought that govern he 
for but even now I hear a strange report 
of speech he shall use to his courtesan 
vaunt what he have do and in what sort 
he labour to advance that proud young man 
so term of your sacred majesty 
with other such extravagant discourse 
whereof we shall attain more certainty 
I doubt not short and descry his course 
meanwhile about your person I advise 
your grace shall call a more sufficient guard 
and on his action set such wary eye 
as may thereof take special good regard 
and note what person chief he frequent 
and who to he have the most free access 
how he bestow his time where he present 
the large revenue of his bounteousness 
and for his wench that lie betwixt his arm 
And know his hare I will about with she 
she shall be wrought to apply her usual charm 
and I will make she my discoverer 
Alex this counsel Craterus we do well allow 
and give thou many thanks for thy great care 
but yet we must bear fair lest he shall know 
that we suspect what his affection be 
for that you see he hold aside of power 
which may perhaps call up some mutiny 
his father old Parmenio at this hour 
rule Medea with no lesser power than I 
himself you see gallant follow 
hold next to we a special government 
Canus that with his sister marry 
have under he again commandment 
Amintas and symanus he dear friend 
with both their honourable office 
and then the private train that on they tend 
with all particular dependence 
be motive to advice we how to deal 
crat your grace say true but yet these cloud of smoke 
vanish before the sun of that respect 
whereon man longinured affection look 
with such a native zeal and so affect 
as that the vain and shallow practise 
of no such giddy traitor if the thing 
be take in time with due advisedness 
shall the least show of any feeling bring 
Alex well then to thou dear Craterus I refer 
the especial care of this great business 

my lord I here have long attendance make 
expect to be call to avouch my news 

in troth my friend I have not find the king 
at any leisure yet to hear the same 

no not at leisure to prevent his death 
and be the matter of no more import 
I will try another yet methinks such man 
as be the eye and ear of prince shall 
not weigh so light such a intelligence 

my lord the sum you will i to give 
the captain that do visit you today 
to tell you plain your coffers yield it not 

how if they yield it not have I not then 
apparel plate jewel why sell they Plutarch in the life of Alexander 
and go your way dispatch and give it he 
methinks I find the king much change of late 
and unto i his grace not so great 
although they seem in show all of one rate 
yet by the touch I find they counterfeit 
for when I speak although I have his ear 
yet do I see his mind be other where 
and when he speak to i I see he strive 
to give a colour unto what be not 
for he must think that we who state who live 
depend upon his grace learn not by rote 
to observe his action and to know his trim 
and though indeed prince be manifold 
yet have they still such eye to wait on they 
as be to pierce that they can behold 
and penetrate the innards of the heart 
that no device can set so close a door 
betwixt their show and thought but that their art 
of shadow it make it appear the more 
but many malice my state of grace 
I know do work with all the power they have 
upon that easy nature to displace 
my fortune and my action to deprave 
and though I know they seek to enclose he in 
and fain will lock he up and chamber he 
yet will I never stoop and seek to win 
my way by they that come not in by they 
and scorn to stand on any other foot 
then these of my own worth and what my plain 
and open action can fair get 
baseness and soothe they shall never gain 
and yet I know my presence and access 
clear all these mist which they have raise before 
though with my back straight turn that happiness 
and they again blow up as much or more 
thus do we role the stone of our own toil 
and man suppose our hell a heaven the while 

ANtigona there be no remedy 
you needs must justify the speech you hold 
with Thais who will your conference verify 
and therefore now it can be conceal 

o my good lord I pray you urge i not 
Thais only of a cunning envious wit 
scorn a stranger shall have such allot 
have out of her invention forge it 

why then shall rack and torture force thou show 
both this and other matter which we know 
think therefore if it be not a wise part 
to accept of rest reward preferment grace 
and be perhaps so beauteous as thou be 
of fair election for a near place 
to tell the truth than to be obstinate 
and fall with the misfortune of a man 
who in his dangerous and concuss state 
no good to thou but ruin render 
resolve thou of this choice and let i know 
thy mind at full at my return back 

what shall I do shall I betray my love 
or die disgrace what do I make a doubt 
betray my love o heavenly power above 
forbid that such a thought shall issue out 
of this confuse breast nay rather first 
let torture death and horror do their worst 
but out alas this inconsiderate tongue 
without my heart consent and privity 
have do already this unwilling wrong 
and now it be no wisdom to deny 
no wisdom to deny yes yes that tongue 
that thus have be the traitor to my heart 
shall either powerful redeem that wrong 
or never more shall word of breath impart 
yet what can my denial profit he 
who they perhaps whether I tell or not 
be purpose upon matter know to they 
to ruinate on some discover plot 
let they do what they will let not thy heart 
seem to be accessary in a thought 
to give the left advantage of thy part 
to have a part of shame in what be wrought 
o this be well if that my danger can 
redeem his peril and his grace restore 
for which I vow my life I render will 
if this poor life can satisfy therefore 
but it be not for thy honour to forsake 
thy love for death that love thou in this sort 
alas what notice will the world take 
of such respect in woman of my sort 
this act may yet put on so fair a coat 
upon my foul profession as it may 
not blush to appear with those of clean note 
and have as high a place with fame as they 
what do I talk of fame do I not see 
this faction of my flesh my fear my youth 
already enter and have bend at i 
the joy of life to batter down my truth 
o my subdue thought what have you do 
to let in fear and falsehood to my heart 
who though they have surprise they have not win 
for still my love shall hold the dear part 

Antigona what be you yet resolve 

resolve my lord to endure all misery 

and so be sure you shall if that by your choice 

what will you have i do my lord I be 
content to say what you will have i say 

then come go with i to Alexander 

how do thou wear and weary out thy day 
restless ambition never at a end 
who travail not Herculean pillar stay 
but still beyond thy rest thy labor tend 
above good fortune thou thy hope do raise 
still climb and yet never can ascend 
for when thou have attain unto the top 
of thy desire thou have not yet get up 
that hey of fortune either be control 
by some more powerful overlook eye 
that do the fullness of thy grace withhold 
or countercheck with some concurrency 
that it do cost far more ado to hold 
the high attain then be to get so high 
where stand thou can not but with careful toil 
nor lose thy hold without thy utter spoil 
there do thou struggle with thy own distrust 
and other jealousy their counterplot 
against some underwork pride that must 
supplant be or else thou stand not 
there wrong be pay with wrong and he that thrust 
down other come himself to have that lot 
the same concussion do afflict his breast 
that other shake oppression be oppress 
that either happiness dwell not so high 
or else above whereto pride can rise 
and that the high of man felicity 
but in the region of affliction lie 
and that we climb but up to misery 
high fortune be but high calamity 
it be not in that sphere where peace do move 
rest dwell below it happiness above 
for in this height of fortune be imbred 
those thunder fragor that affright the earth 
from thence have all distemperature their head 
that bring forth desolation famine dearth 
there certain order be disorder 
and there it be confusion have her birth 
it be that high of fortune do undo 
both her own quietness and other too 

come Metron say of who have thou receive 
the intelligence of this conspiracy 
contrive against our person as thou say 
by Dymnus and some other of the camp 
be it not some vain report bear without cause 
that envy or imagination draw 
from private end to breed a public fear 
to amuse the world with thing that never be 

here may it please your highness be the man 
one Ceballinus that bring i the news 

o Alexander I have save thy life 
I be the man that have reveal their plot 

and how come thou to be inform thereof 

by my own brother one Nichomacus 
who Dymnus chief of the conspirator 
acquaint with the whole of their intent 

how long since be it this be tell to thou 

about some three day my sovereign lord 

what three day since and have thou so long keep 
the thing conceal from we being of that weight 
guard take and lay he present in hold 

o may it please your grace I do not keep 
the thing conceal one hour but present 
run to acquaint Philotas therewithal 
suppose he a man so near in place 
will best respect a case that touch so near 
and on he have I wait these two day 
expect to have be bring unto your grace 
and see he weigh it light pretend that 
your grace leisure serve not fit to hear 
ay to the master of your armoury 
address myself forthwith to Metron here 
who without make any more delay 
press in unto your grace be in your bath 
lock i up the while in the armoury 
and all what I can show reveal have 

if this be so then fellow I confess 
thy loyal care of we be more than they 
who have more reason they shall have be more 
cause Dymnus to be present bring forth 
and call Philotas straight who now I see 
have not deceive i in deceive i 
who will have think one who I hold so near 
will from my safety have be so far off 
when most it shall and ought import his care 
and wherein his allegiance may make proof 
of those effect my favour have deserve 
and ought to have claim more due at his hand 
then any of the rest but thus we be serve 
when private grace out of proportion stand 
and that we call up man from of below 
from the element of base property 
and set they where they may behold and know 
the way of might and work of majesty 
where see those ray which be send far off 
reflect a heat of wonder and respect 
to fail near hand and not to show that proof 
the object only work that effect 
think see themselves though by our favour set 
within the self same orb of rule with we 
their light will shine alone if we be set 
and so presume to obscure or shadow we 
but he shall know although his nearness have 
not feel our heat that we can burn he too 
and grace that shine can kindle unto wrath 
and Alexander and the king be two 
but here they bring we Dymnus in who face 
I see be gild despair horror and death 

yea death indeed for ere he can be attach 
he stab himself so deadly to the heart 
as it be impossible that he shall live 

say Dymnus what have I deserve of thou 
that thou shall think worthy to be thy king 
Philotas then ourself hold hold he sink 
guard keep he up get he to answer we 

he have speak his last he will never answer more 

sorry I be for that for now have death 
shut we clean out from know he within 
and lock up in his breast all the other heart 
but yet this deed argue the truth in gross 
though we be bar it in particular 
Philotas be you come look here this man 
this Ceballinus shall have suffer death 
can it but have be prove he have conceal 
the intend treason from we these two day 
wherewith he say he straight acquaint thou 
think the more near thou be about ourself 
the great be the shame of thy offence 
and which have be less foul in he then thou 

renown prince for that my heart be clear 
amazement can overcast my face 
and I must bold with the assure cheer 
of my unguilty conscience tell your grace 
that this offence thus happen be not make 
by any the least thought of ill in i 
and that the keep of it unbewrayed 
be that I hold the rumor vain to be 
consider some who be accuse be know 
your ancient and most loyal servitor 
and such as rather will let out their own 
heart blood I know then once endanger you 
and for i then upon no certain note 
but on the brabble of two wanton youth 
to have tell a idle tale that will have wrought 
in your distrust and wrong to other truth 
and to no end but only to have make 
myself a scorn and odious unto all 
for which I rather take the bait be lay 
then else for any treachery at all 
I must confess I think the safe way 
to smother it a while to the end I may 
if such a thing can be some proof bewray 
that may yield probability of right 
protest that my own unspotted thought 
a like belief of other truth do breed 
judge no impious wretch can have be wrought 
to imagine such a detestable deed 
and therefore oh dread sovereign do not way 
Philotas faith by this his oversight 
but by his action past and only lay 
error to his charge not malice not despite 

well lo thou have a favourable judge 
when though thou have not power to clear thy blame 
yet have he power to pardon thou the same 
which take not as thy right but as his grace 
since here the person alter not the case 
and here Philotas I forgive the offence 
and to confirm the same lo here be my hand 

o sacred hand the witness of my life 
by thou I hold my safety as secure 
as be my conscience free from treachery 

well get your charge and look to our affair 
for we tomorrow purpose to remove 

in troth I know not what to judge herein 
methinks the man seem sure clear in this 
however otherwise his hope have be 
transport by his unadvisedness 
it can be a guilty conscience shall 
put on so sure a brow or else by art 
his look stand neutral seem not to hold 
respondency of interest with his heart 
sure for my part he have dissolve the knot 
of my suspicion with so clear a hand 
as that I think in this whatever plot 
of mischief it may be he have no hand 

my lord the great confidence he show 
who be suspect shall be fear the more 
for danger from weak nature never grow 
who must disturb the world be build therefore 
he more be to be fear that nothing fear 
and malice most effect that least appear 
presumption of man power as well may breed 
assuredness as innocency may 
and mischief seldom but by trust do speed 
who king betray first their belief betray 
I will your grace have first confer with we 
since you will needs such clemency have show 
that we may yet but have advise you thus 
that he his danger never may have know 
in fault wherein a after shame will live 
it be better to conceal then to forgive 
for who be bring unto the block of death 
think rather on the peril they have pass 
then on that grace which have preserve their breath 
and more their suffering then their mercy taste 
he now to plot your danger still may live 
but you his guilt not always to forgive 
know that a man so swell with discontent 
no grace can cure nor pardon can restore 
he know how those who once have mercy spend 
can never hope to have it any more 
but say that through remorse he calm prove 
will great Parmenio so attend on 
with that brave army foster in his love 
be thankful for this grace you do his son 
some benefit be odious so be this 
where man be still ashamed to confess 
to have so do as to deserve to die 
and ever do desire that man shall guess 
they rather have receive a injury 
than life since life they know in such a case 
may be restore to all but not to grace 

and for my part my liege I hold this mind 
that sure he will not have so much suppress 
the notice of a treason in that kind 
unless he be a party with the rest 
can it be think that great parmenios son 
the general commander of the horse 
the minion of the camp the only one 
of secret counsel and of free recourse 
shall not in three day space have find the king 
at leisure to hear three word of that import 
while he himself in idle lavish 
do thousand spend to advance his own report 

and if he give no credit to the youth 
why do he two day space delay he then 
as if he have believe it for a truth 
to hinder his address to other man 
if he have hold it but a vain conceit 
I pray why have he not dismiss he straight 
Men in their private danger may be stout 
but in the occasion and the fear of king 
we ought not to be credulous but doubt 
the intimation of the vain thing 

well howsoever we will yet this night 
disport and banquet in unusual wise 
that it may seem we weigh this practice light 
however heavy here within it lie 
king may not know distrust and though they fear 
they must not take acquaintance of their fear 

o you be a secret councilkeeper Thais 
in troth I little think you such a one 

and why Antigona what have I do 

you know full well your conscience you bewray 

alas good soul will you have i conceal 
that which yourself can not but needs reveal 
think you another can be more to you 
in what concern they not than you can be 
who it import will other hold they true 
when you prove false to your own secrecy 
but yet this be no wonder for we see 
wise than we do lay their head to gauge 
for riotous expense of their tongue 
although it be a property belong 
especial to we and every age 
can show strange precedent what we have be 
in case of the great plot of man 
and it be the scene on this world stage we play 
who revolution we with man convert 
and be to act our part as well as they 
though common the weak yet apart 
for this great motion of a state we see 
do turn on many wheel and some though small 
do yet the great move who in degree 
stir those who likewise turn the great of all 
for though we be not wise we see the wise 
by we be make or make we party still 
in action of the great quality 
that they can manage be they good or ill 

I can tell but you have make i do 
that which must ever more afflict my heart 
and if this be my woeful part to undo 
my dear love will I have have no part 
how have I seely woman sift be 
examine try flatter terrify 
by Craterus the cunning of man 
that never leave i till I have descry 
whatever of Philotas I have know 

what be that all perhaps I have thereby 
do thou more good than thou can apprehend 

such good I rather you shall get than I 
if that can be a good to accuse my friend 

Alas thy accusation do but quote 
the margin of some text of great note 

but that be more than thou or I can tell 

yes yes Antigona I know it well 
for be thou sure that always those who seek 
to attack the lion so provide that still 
their toil be such as that he shall not scape 
to turn his rage on those that wrought his ill 
Philotas neither be so strong nor high 
but malice overlook he and descry 
where he lie weak where be his vanity 
and build her countermount upon that side 
in such sort as they will be sure to raze 
his fortune with the engine of disgrace 
and now may thou perhaps come great hereby 
and gracious with his great enemy 
for such man think they have no full success 
unless they likewise gain the mistress 
of those they master and succeed the place 
and fortune of their love with equal grace 

love be out alas love such a one as he 
that seek to undo my love and in he i 

tush love his fortune love his state his place 
whatever greatness do it must have grace 

I weigh not greatness I must please my eye 

the eye nothing fair see than dignity 

but what be dignity without our love 

if we have that we can want our love 

why that give but the outside of delight 
the daytime joy what comfort have the night 

if power procure not that what can it do 

I know not how that can be attain unto 

nor will I teach thou if thou know it not 
it be vain I see to learn a asian wit 

if this be that great wit that learned skill 
you greek profess let i be foolish still 
so I be faithful and now be here alone 
let i record the heavy note of moan 

my lord you see the flexible conceit 
of our endanger sovereign and you know 
how much his peril and Philotas pride 
import the state and we and therefore now 
we either must oppose against deceit 
or be undo for now have time descry 
a open passage to his far end 
from whence if negligence now put we back 
return we never can without our wrack 
and good my lord since you conceive as much 
and that we stand alike make not i prosecute 
the cause alone as if it do but touch 
only myself and that I do both breed 
and urge these doubt out of a private grief 
Indeed I know I may with much more ease 
sit still like other and if danger come 
may think to shift for one as well as they 
but yet the faith the duty and respect 
we owe both to our sovereign and the state 
my lord I hold require another care 

my lord assure you we will take a time 
to urge a strict count of Dymnus death 

my lord I say unless this be the time 
you will apply your physic after death 
you see the king invite have this night 
Philotas with the rest and entertain 
he with as kind a usage to our sight 
as ever and you see the cunning strain 
of sweet insinuation that be use 
to allure the ear of grace with false report 
so that all this will come to be excuse 
with one remove one action quite transport 
the king affection over to his hope 
and set he so beyond the due regard 
of his own safety as one enterprise 
may serve their turn and may we all surprise 

but now since thing thus of themselves break out 
we have advantage to prevent the worst 
and every day will yield we more no doubt 
for they be save that thus be warn first 

so my lord Clitus be they likewise warn 
to accelerate their plot be thus bewray 

but that they can now it be too late 
for treason take ere the birth do come 
abortive and her womb be make her tomb 

you do not know how far it have put forth 
the force of malice nor how far be spread 
already the contagion of this ill 

why then there may some one be torture 
of those who Ceballinus bath reveal 
whereby the rest may be discover 

that one must be Philotas from who head 
all this corruption flow take he take all 

Philotas be not name and therefore may 
perhaps not be acquaint with this plot 

that his conceal of the plot betray 
and if we do not cast to find he first 
his wit be sure bath lay so good a ground 
as he will be the last that will be find 

but if he be not find then in this case 
we do he more by injure his grace 

if that he be not find to have deal in this 
yet this will force out some such thought of he 
as will undo he for you seldom see 
such man arraign that ever quit be 

well my lord Craterus we will move his grace 
though it be late before he take his rest 
that some course may be take in this case 
and God ordain it may be for the best 

see how these greatman clothe their private hate 
in those fair colour of the public good 
and to effect their end pretend the state 
as if the state by their affection stand 
and arm with power and prince jealousy 
will put the least conceit of discontent 
into the great rank of treachery 
that no one action shell seem innocent 
yea valour honour bounty shall be make 
as accessary unto end unjust 
and even the service of the state must lade 
the needful undertake with distrust 
so that base vileness idle luxury 
seem safe far than to do worthy 
suspicion full of eye and full of ear 
do through the tincture of her own conceit 
see all thing in the colour of her fear 
and truth itself must look like to deceit 
that what way ever the suspect take 
still envy will most cunning forelay 
the ambush of their ruin or will make 
their humour of themselves to take that way 
but this be still the fate of those that be 
by nature or their fortune eminent 
who either carry in conceit too far 
do work their own or other discontent 
or else be deem sit to be suppress 
not for they be but that they may be ill 
since state have ever have far more unrest 
by spirit of worth than man of mean skill 
and find that those do always better prove 
who be equal to employment not above 
for self opinion will be see more wise 
than present counsel custom order law 
and to the end to have they otherwise 
the common wealth into combustion draw 
as if ordain to embroil the world with wit 
aswell as grossness to dishonour it 

can there be such a sudden change in court 
as you report be it to be believe 
that great Philotas who we all behold 
in grace last night shall be arraign today 

it can be and it be as I report 
for state of grace be no sure hold in court 

but yet it be strange they shall be overthrow 
before their certain forfeiture be know 

tush it be breed long though sudden 
this thundercrack come but to break out now 

the time I wait and I wait long 
until Philotas with some other lord 
depart the presence and as I conceive 
I never see the king in better mood 
nor yet Philotas ever in more grace 
can such storm grow and yet no cloud appear 

yea court storm grow when sky there seem most clear 
it be about the deep of the night 
the black hour of darkness and of sleep 
when with some other lord come Craterus 
fall down before the king entreat implore 
conjure his grace as ever he will look 
to save his person and the state from spoil 
now to prevent Philotas practise 
who they have plain find to be the man 
have plot the destruction of they all 
the king will fain have put they off to time 
and far day till better proof be know 
which they perceive press he still the more 
and reinforce his danger and their own 
and never leave he till they have obtain 
commission to apprehend Philotas straight 
now to make fear look with more hideous face 
or else but to beget it out of form 
and careful preparation of distrust 
about the palace man in armour watch 
in armour man about the king attend 
all passage and issue be forelay 
with horse to interrupt whatever news 
shall hence break out into parmenio camp 
I with three hundred man in armour charge 
have warrant to attach and to commit 
the person of Philotas present 
and come to his lodging where he lie 
find he embury in the sound sleep 
that ever man can be where neither noise 
of clatter weapon or our rush in 
with rude and trample rumour can dissolve 
the heavy humour of that drowsy brow 
which hold perhaps his sense now more fast 
as loath to leave because it be the last 

Attarras what can treason sleep so sound 
will that loud hand of horror that still beat 
upon the guilty conscience of distrust 
permit it to have so resolute a rest 

I can tell but thus we find he there 
nor can we I assure you waken he 
till thrice I call he by his name and thrice 
have shake he hard and then at length he wake 
and look on i with a settle cheer 
dear friend Attarras what be the news say he 
what up so soon to hasten the remove 
or raise by some alarm or some distrust 
I tell he that the king have some distrust 
why what will Nabarzanes play say he 
the villain with the king as he have do 
already with his miserable lord 
I see he will or do not understand 
his own distress tell he the charge I have 
wherewith he rise and rise use these word 
oh Alexander now I see my foe 
have get above thy goodness and prevail 
against my innocency and thy word 
and as we then enchain and fetter he 
look on that base furniture of shame 
poor body say he have so many alarm 
raise thou to blood and danger from thy rest 
to inve thou with this armour now at last 
be this the service I be call to now 
but we that be not to attend his plaint 
cover his head with a disgraceful weed 
take and convey he sudden to ward 
from whence he shall be instant bring forth 
here to be arraign before the king who sit 
accord to the macedonian use 
in case capital himself as judge 

well then I see who be so high above 
be never to lightning that be never to jove 

the heinous treason of some few have like 
to have rent i from you worthy soldier 
but by the mercy of the immortal god 
I live and joy your sight your reverend sight 
which make i more to abhor those parricide 
not for my own respect but for the wrong 
you have receive if their design have stand 
since I desire but life to do you good 
but how will you be move when you shall know 
who be the man that do attempt this shame 
when I shall show that which I grieve to show 
and name such as will God I can not name 
but that the foulness of their practice now 
blot out all memory of what they be 
and though I will suppress they yet I know 
this shame of they will never but appear 
Parmenio be the man a man you see 
bind by so many merit both to i 
and to my father our ancient friend 
a man of year experience gravity 
who wicked minister Philotas be 
who here Demetrius luculaus and 
this Dymnus who dead body here you see 
with other have suborn to slaughter i 
And here come Metron with Nichomacus 
to who this murder wretch at first reveal 
the project of this whole conspiracy 
to aver as much as be disclose to he 
Nichomacus look here advise thou well 
what do thou know this man that here lie dead 

my sovereign lord I know he very well 
it be one Dymnus who do three day since 
bewray to i a treason practise 
by he and other to have slay your grace 

where or by who or when do he report 
this wicked act shall be accomplish 

he say within three day your majesty 
shall be within your chamber murder 
by special man of the nobility 
of who he many name and they be these 
loceus Demetrius and Archelopis 
Nicanor and Amyntas luculous 
droceus with aphebaetus and himself 

thus much his brother Ceballinus do 
reveal to i from out this youth report 

and so much with the circumstance of all 
do I unto Philotas intimate 

then what have be his mind who do suppress 
the information of so foul a train 
yourselves my worthy soldier well may guess 
which Dymnus death declare not to be vain 
poor Ceballinus not a moment stay 
to redischarge himself of such a weight 
Philotas careless fearless nothing weigh 
nor aught reveal his silence show deceit 
and tell he be content it shall be do 
which though he be no party make he one 
for he that know upon what power he stand 
and see his father greatness and his own 
see nothing in the way which now withstand 
his vast desire but only this my crown 
which in respect that I be issueless 
he think the rather easy to be attain 
but yet Philotas be deceive in this 
I have who shall inherit all I gain 
in you I have both child kindred friend 
you be the heir of all my purchase 
and while you live I be not issueless 
and that these be not shadow of my fear 
for I fear nought but want of enemy 
see what this intercept letter bear 
and how Parmenio do his son advice 
this show their end hold read it Craterus 

my son first have a special care unto yourselves 
then unto those which do depend on you 
so shall you do what you intend to do 

see but how close he write that if these line 
shall come unto his son as they be send 
they may encourage they in their design 
if enterprise may mock the ignorant 
but now you see what be the thing be mean 
you see the father care the son intent 
and what if he as a conspirator 
be not by Dymnus name among the rest 
that show not his innocence but his power 
who they account too great to be suppress 
and rather will accuse themselves then he 
for that while he shall live there be hope for they 
and how he have bear himself in private sort 
I will not stand to urge it be too well know 
nor what have be his arrogant report 
to embase my action and to brag his own 
nor how he mock my letter which I write 
to show he of the style bestow on i 
by the oracle of jove these thing I think 
but weakness and word of vanity 
yet word that read the ulcer of his heart 
which I suppress and never cease to yield 
the chief reward of worth and still compart 
the best degree and honour of the field 
in hope to win his love yet now at length 
there have I danger where I look for strength 
I will to God my blood have rather be 
pour out the offering of a enemy 
then practise to be shed by one of i 
that one of i shall have this infamy 
have I be so reserve from fear to fall 
there where I ought not to have fear at all 
have you so oft advise i to regard 
the safety which you see i run from 
when with some hot pursuit I press hard 
my foe abroad to perish thus at home 
but now that safety only rest in you 
which you so oft have wish i look unto 
and now unto your bosom must I fly 
without who will I will not wish to live 
and with your will I can less I give 
due punishment unto this treachery 

Attarras bring the hateful prisoner forth 
this traitor which have seek to undo we all 
to give we up to slaughter and to make 
our blood a scorn here in a barbarous land 
that none of we shall have return back 
unto our native country to our wife 
our age parent kindred and our friend 
to make the body of this glorious host 
a most deform trunk without a head 
without the life or soul to guide the same 

o thou base traitor impious parricide 
who make i loathe the blood that match with thou 
and if I may but have my will I vow 
thou shall not die by other hand than i 

fie Caenus what a barbarous course be this 
he first must to his accusation plead 
and have his trial formal to our law 
and let he make the best of his bad cause 
Philotas here the macedonian be 
to judge your fact what language will thou use 

the persian language if it please your grace 
for that beside the macedonian here 
be many that will better understand 
if I shall use the speech your grace have use 
which be I hold unto no other end 
but that the most man here may understand 

see how his native language he disdain 
but let he speak at large as he desire 
so long as you remember he do hate 
beside the speech our glory and the state 

Black be the colour lay upon the crime 
wherewith my faith stand charge my worthy lord 
that as behind in fortune so in time 
I come too late to clear the same with word 
my condemnation be go out before 
my innocency and my just defence 
and take up all your heart and leave no door 
for my excuse to have a entrance 
that destitute of all compassion now 
betwixt a upright conscience of desert 
and a unjust disgrace I know not how 
to satisfy the time and my own heart 
authority look with so stern a eye 
upon this woeful bar and must have still 
such a advantage over misery 
as that it will make good all that it will 
he who shall only judge my cause be go 
and why he will not stay I do not see 
since when my cause be hear his power alone 
as well may then condemn as set i free 
nor can I by his absence now be clear 
who presence have condemn i thus unheard 
and though the grievance of a prisoner tongue 
may both superfluous and disgraceful seem 
which do not sue but show the judge his wrong 
yet pardon i I must not disesteem 
my rightful cause for be despise nor must 
forsake myself though I be left of all 
fear can make my innocence unjust 
unto itself to give my truth the fall 
and I have rather see how my fortune draw 
my word shall be deform then my cause 
I know that nothing be more delicate 
than be the sense and feel of a state 
the clap the bruit the fear but of a hurt 
in king behalf thrust with that violence 
the subject will to prosecute report 
as they condemn ere they discern the offence 

Philotas you deceive yourself in this 
that think to win compassion and belief 
by impugn justice and to make man guess 
we do you wrong out of our heat of grief 
or that our place or passion do lay more 
on your misfortune than your own desert 
or have not well discern your fact before 
or will without due proof your state subvert 
these be the usual theme of traitor tongue 
who practise mischief and complain of wrong 
your treason be too manifest know 
to mask in other livery than their own 

think not that we be set to charge you here 
with bare suspicion but with open fact 
and with a treason that appear as clear 
as be the sun and know to be your act 

what be this treason who accuse i 

the process of the whole conspiracy 

but where be the man that name i to be one 

here this dead traitor show you to be one 

how can he dead accuse i of the same 
who live he nor do nor yet can name 

but we can other testimony show 
from those who be your chief complice 

I be not too be adjudge in law you know 
by testimony but by witness no testimonijs sine testibsu 
let they be here produce unto my face 
that can avouch I a party in this case 
my lord and fellow soldier if of those 
who Dymnus nominate any one 
out of his torture will a word disclose 
to show I be a party I have do 
think not so great a number ever will 
endure their torment and themselves accuse 
and leave i out since man in such case still 
will rather slander other than excuse 
calamity malignant be and he 
that suffer just for his guiltiness 
ease his own affliction but to see 
other torment in the same distress 
and yet I fear not whatsoever they 
by rack and torture can be forest to say 
have I be one will Dymnus have conceal 
my name be hold to be the principal 
will he not for his glory have reveal 
the best to he to who he must tell all 
nay if he false then have name i one 
to grace himself must I of force be one 
Alas if Ceballinus have not come to i 
and give i note of this conspiracy 
I have not stand here now but be as free 
from question as I be from treachery 
that be the only cloud that thunder 
on my disgrace which have I deem true 
or can but have divine of Dymnus death 
Philotas have my lord sit therewith you 
my fault be to have be too credulous 
wherein I show my weakness I confess 

Philotas what a monarch and confess 
your imperfection and your weakness 

o Craterus do not insult upon calamity 
it be a barbarous grossness to lay on 
the weight of scorn where heavy misery 
too much already way man fortune down 
for if the cause be ill I undergo 
the law and not reproach must make it so 

there be no reproach can ever be too much 
to lay on traitor who desert be such 

Men use the most reproach where they fear 
the cause will better prove then their desire 

but sir a traitor cause that be so clear 
as this of you will never need that fear 

I be no traitor but suspect one 
for not believe a conspiracy 
and mere suspect by law condemn none 
they be approve fact for which man die 

the law in treason do the will correct 
with like severeness as it do the effect 
the affection be the essence of the offence 
the execution only but the accidence 
to have but will it be to have do the same 

I do not err in will but in belief 
and if that be a traitor then be I the chief 

yea but your will make your belief consent 
to hide the practise till the accomplishment 

belief turn not by motion of our will 
and it be but the event that make that ill 
some fact man may excuse though not defend 
where will and fortune have a diverse end 
the example of my father make i fear 
to be too forward to relate thing hear 
who write to the king wish he forbear 
the potion his physician have prepare 
for that he hear Darius tempt have 
his faith with many talent to be untrue 
and yet his drug in the end not prove bad 
do make my father care seem more than due 
for oft by a untimely diligence 
a busy faith may give a prince offence 
so that what shall we do if we reveal 
we be despise suspect if conceal 
and as for this wherever now thou be 
oh Alexander thou have pardon i 
thou have already give i thy hand 
the earnest of thy reconcile heart 
and therefore now o let thy goodness stand 
unto thy word and be thou as thou be 
if thou believe i then I be absolve 
if pardon i these fetter be dissolve 
what have I else deserve since yesternight 
when at thy table I such grace do find 
what heinous crime have since be bring to light 
to wrong my faith and to divert thy mind 
that from a restful quiet most profound 
sleep in my misfortune make secure 
both by thy hand and by a conscience sound 
I must be wake for gyve for robe impure 
for all disgrace that on i wrath can lay 
and see the worst of shame ere I see day 
when I least think that other cruelty 
shall have wrought more than thou own clemency 

Philotas whatsoever gloss you lay 
upon your rot cause it be in vain 
your pride your carriage ever do bewray 
your discontent your malice and disdain 
you can palliate mischief but it will 
through all the fair cover of deceit 
be always see we know those stream of ill 
flow from that head that feed they with conceit 
you foster malcontent you entertain 
all humour you all faction must embrace 
you vaunt your own exploit and you disdain 
the king proceed and his style disgrace 
you promise mountain and you draw man on 
with hope of great good then have be see 
you brag of late that something will be do 
whereby your concubine shall be a queen 
and now we see the thing that shall be do 
but God be praise we see you first undo 

ah do not make my nature if it have 
so pliable a stern of disposition 
to turn to every kindness to be bad 
for do good to man of all condition 
make not you charity to interpret all 
be do for favour to be do for show 
and that we in our bounty prodigal 
upon our end not on man need bestow 
let not my one day error make you tell 
that all my lifetime I do never well 
and that because this fall out to be ill 
that what I do do tend unto this ill 
it be unjust to join to a present fact 
more of time past then it have ever have 
before to do withal as if it lack 
sufficient matter to make it bad 
I do confess indeed I write something 
against this title of the son of jove 
and that not of the king but to the king 
I freely use these word out of my love 
and thereby have that dangerous liberty 
of speak truth with trust on former grace 
betray my meaning unto enmity 
and draw a argument of my disgrace 
so that I see though I speak what I ought 
it be not in that manner as I ought 
and God forbid that ever soldier word 
shall be make liable unto misdeed 
when faint in their march tire in the fight 
sick in their tent stop their wound that bleed 
or haut and jolly after conquest goat 
they shall out of their heat use word unkind 
their deed deserve to have they rather think 
the passion of the season than their mind 
for soldier joy or wrath be measureless 
rapt with a instant motion and we blame 
we hate we praise we pity in excess 
accord as our present passion flame 
sometime to pass the ocean we will feign 
sometime to other world and sometime slack 
and idle with our conquest entertain 
a sullen humour of return back 
all which conceit one trumpet sound do end 
and each man run to his rank do lose 
what in our tent dislike we and we spend 
all that conceive wrath upon our foe 
and word if they proceed of levity 
be to be scorn of madness pity 
if out of malice or of injury 
to be remiss or unacknowledged 
for of themselves they vanish by disdain 
but if pursue they will be think not vain 

but word accord to the person way 
if his design be heinous so be they 
they be the tinder of sedition still 
wherewith you kindle fierce inflame man will 

Craterus you have the advantage of the day 
the law be you to say what you will say 
and yet do all your gloss but bear the sense 
only of my misfortune not offence 
have I pretend mischief to the king 
can not I have effect it without 
Dimnus do not my free access bring 
continual mean to have bring the same about 
be not I since I hear the thing descry 
alone and arm in private with his grace 
what hinder i that then I have not try 
to have do that mischief have time and place 

Philotas even the providence above 
protectress of the sacred state of king 
that never suffer treachery to have 
good council never in this case but bring 
confusion to the actor do undo 
your heart in what you go about to do 

but yet despair we see do thrust man on 
see no way else to undo ere be undo 

that same despair do likewise let man fall 
in that amaze they can do nought at all 

well well my lord my service have make know 
the faith I owe my sovereign and the state 
Philotas forwardness have ever show 
unto all nation at how high a rate 
I prize my king and at how low my blood 
to do he honour and my country good 

we blame not what you have be but what you be 
we accuse not here your valour but your fact 
not to have be a leader in the war 
but a ill subject in a wicked act 
although we know thrust rather with the love 
of your own glory then with duty lead 
you have do much yet all your course prove 
you tide still your achievement to the head 
of your own honour when it have be meet 
you have they lay down at your sovereign foot 
God give to king the honour to command 
to subject all their glory to obey 
who ought in time of war as rampier stand 
in peace as the ornament of state array 
the king have recompense your service 
with better love than you show thankfulness 
by grace he make you great than you be 
by nature you receive that which he be not tide 
to give to you his gift be far more dear 
than all you do in make you employ 
but say your service have deserve at all 
this one offence have make it odious all 
and therefore here in vain you use that mean 
to plead for life which you have conceal clean 

my lord you far mistake i if you deem 
I plead for life that poor weak blast of breath 
from which so oft I run with light esteem 
and so well have acquaint i with death 
no no my lord it be not that I fear 
it be my honour that I seek to clear 
and which if my disgrace cause will let 
the language of my heart be understand 
be all which I have ever seek to get 
and which oh leave i now and take my blood 
let not your envy go beyond the bound 
of what you seek my life stand in your way 
that be your aim take it and do not wound 
my reputation with that wrong I pray 
if I must needs be make the sacrifice 
of envy and that no oblation will 
the wrath of king but only blood suffice 
yet let i have something leave that be not ill 
be there no way to get unto our life 
but first to have our honour overthrow 
Alas though grace of king all greatness give 
it can give we virtue that be our own 
though all be they our heart and hand can do 
yet that by which we do be only we 
the trophy that our blood erect unto 
their memory to glorify their power 
let they enjoy yet only to have do 
worthy of grace let not that be undo 
let that high swell river of their fame 
leave humble stream that feed they yet their name 
oh my dear father do thou bring that spirit 
those hand of valour that so much have do 
in this great work of Asia this to merit 
by do worthy to be undo 
and have thou make this purchase of thy sword 
to get so great a empire for thy lord 
and so disgrace a grave for thou and thou 
to extinguish by thy service all thy line 
one of thy son by be to valorous 
but five day since yet o well lose his breath 
thy dear Nicanor the half arch of thy house 
and here now the other at the bar of death 
stand overcharge with wrath in far worse case 
and be to be confound with disgrace 
thyself must give the acquittance of thy blood 
for other debt to who thou have do good 
which if they will a little time afford 
death will have take it without a sword 
such the reward of great employment be 
hate kill in peace who fortune spare in war 
and this be that high grace of king we seek 
who favour and who wrath consume a like 

Lo here the misery of king who cause 
however just it be however strong 
yet in respect they may their greatness draw 
the world to think they ever do the wrong 
but this foul fact of you you stand upon 
Philotas shall beside the apparency 
which all the world see plain ere we have do 
by your own mouth be make to satisfy 
the most stiff partialist that will not see 

my mouth will never prove so false I trust 
unto my heart to show itself unjust 
and what I here do speak I know my lord 
I speak with my own mouth but other where 
what may be say I say may be the word 
not of my breath but fame that oft do err 
let the oracle of Ammon be enquire 
about this fact who if it shall be true 
will never suffer those who have conspire 
against jove son to escape without their due 
but will reveal the truth or if this shall 
not seem convenient why then lay on all 
the torture that may force a tongue to tell 
the secret thought that can imagine ill 

what need we send to know more than we know 
that be to give you time to acquaint your friend 
with your estate till some combustion grow 
within the camp to hasten on your end 
and that the gold and all the treasury 
commit to your father custody 
in Media now may arm his desperate troop 
to come upon we and to cut our throat 
what shall we ask of jove that which he have 
reveal already but let we send to give 
thank that by he the king have scape the wrath 
of thou disloyal traitor and do live 

let we tear the wretch in piece let we rend 
with our own hand the traitorous parricide 

peace Belon silence love soldier 
you see my lord out of your judgment grave 
that all excuse sickly colour have 
and he that have thus false and faithless be 
must find out other god and other man 
who to forswear and who he may deceive 
no word of he can make we more believe 
his impudence and therefore see it be late 
we till the morning do dismiss the court 

well then I see there be small difference 
betwixt your state and we you civil Greek 
you great contriver of free government 
who skill the world from out all country seek 
those who you call your king be but the same 
as be our sovereign tyrant of the east 
I see they only differ but in name 
the effect they show agree or near at least 
your great man here as our great Satrapa 
I see lay prostrate be with base shame 
upon the least suspect or jealousy 
your king to conceive or other envy frame 
only herein they differ that your prince 
proceed by form of law to effect his end 
our persian monarch make his frown convince 
the strong truth his sword the process end 
with present death and make no more ado 
he never stand to give a gloss unto 
his violence to make it to appear 
in other hue then that it ought to bear 
wherein plain deal best his course commend 
for more he offend who by the law offend 
what need have Alexander so to strive 
by all these show of form to find this man 
guilty of treason when he do contrive 
to have he so adjudge do what he can 
he must not be acquit though he be clear 
the offender not the offence be punish here 
and what avail the forecondemned to speak 
however strong his cause his state be weak 

ah but it satisfy the world and we 
think that well do which do by law we see 

and yet your law serve but your private end 
and to the compass of your power extend 
but be it for the majesty of king 
to sit in judgment thus themselves with you 

to do man justice be the thing that bring 
the great majesty on earth to king 

that by their subalternate minister 
may be perform as well and with more grate 
for to command it to be do infer 
more glory than to do it do embase 
the opinion of a power to invulgar so 
that sacred presence which shall never go 
never be see but even as god below 
like to our persian king in glorious show 
and who as star affix to their sphere 
may not descend to be from what they be 

where king be so like god there subject be not man 

your king begin this course and what will you be then 

Indeed since prosperous fortune give the rain 
to headstrong power and lust I must confess 
we grecian have lose deep by our gain 
and this our greatness make we much the less 
for by the accession of these mighty state 
which Alexander wondrous have get 
he have forget himself and we and rate 
his state above mankind and we at nought 
This have thy pompeô feeble Asia wrought 
thy base adore have transform the king 
into that shape of pride as he be bring 
out of his wit out of acknowledge 
from whence the glory of his greatness spring 
and that it be our sword that wrought these thing 
how well be we within the narrow bound 
of our sufficient yield Macedon 
before our king enlarge then with our wound 
and make these sally of ambition 
before they come to give the regal law 
to those free state which keep their crown in awe 
they by these large dominion be make more 
but we become far weak than before 
what get we now by win but wide mind 
and weary body with the expence of blood 
what shall ill do since happy fortune find 
but misery and be not good though good 
action beget still action and retain 
our hope beyond our wish draw on 
Anever end circle of our pain 
that make we not have do when we have do 
what can give bound to Alexander end 
who count the world but small that call he great 
and his desire beyond his prey distend 
like beast that murder more than they can eat 
when shall we look his travail will be do 
that tend beyond the ocean and the sun 
what discontentment will there still arise 
in such a camp of king to intershock 
each other greatness and what mutiny 
will put he from his comfort and will mock 
his hope and never suffer he to have 
that which he have of all which fortune give 
and from Philotas blood o worthy man 
who body now rend on the torture lie 
will slow that vain of fresh conspiracy 
as overflow he will do what he can 
for cruelty do not embitter man 
but they more wary make than they have be 

be not your greatman free from torture then 
must they be likewise rack as other man 

treason afford a privilege to none 
who like offend have punishment all one 

frriend Sostratus come have you ever know 
such a distract face of court as now 
such a distrustful eye as man be grow 
to fear themselves and all and do not know 
where be the side that shake not who look best 
in this foul day the oppressor or the opress 
what post what dispatch what advice 
what search what run what discovery 
what rumour what suggestion what device 
to clear the king please people hold the wise 
retain the rude crush the suspect sort 
at unaware ere they discern they be hurt 
so much the fall of such a weighty peer 
do shake the state and with he tumble down 
all who his beam of favour do upbear 
all who to rest upon his base be know 
and none that do but touch upon his love 
be free from fear to perish with his love 
myself who all the world have know to embrace 
Parmenio in the entireness of my heart 
and ever in all battle every chase 
of danger fight still next he on that part 
be seize on this last night late in my bed 
and bring unto the presence of the king 
to pay I think the tribute of my head 
but o it be for a more abhor thing 
I must redeem my danger with the blood 
of this dear friend this dear parmenio blood 
his life must pay for i these hand must gore 
that worthy heart for who they fight before 

what have the king command such a deed 
to make the heart of all his subject bleed 
must that old worthy man Parmenio die 

o Sostratus he have his doom to die 
and we must yield unto necessity 
for come to the king and there receive 
with unexpected grace he thus begin 
Polidamas we both have be deceive 
in hold friendship with that faithless man 
Parmenio who for all his gloze mine 
thou see have seek to cut my throat and thou 
and thou must work revenge for thou and i 
and therefore haste to Media speedy 
take these two letter here the one from i 
unto my sure and trusty servant there 
the other sign with Philotas seal 
as if the same to his father write be 
carry they both effect what I have say 
the one will give the access the other aid 
I take the letter vow to effect the same 
and here I go the instrument of shame 

but will you charge your honour with this shame 

I must or be undo with all my name 
for I have leave all the adamantive tie 
of blood and nature that can hold a heart 
chain to the world my brethren and ally 
the hostage to caution for my part 
and for their life must I dishonour i 
else shall the king rather have turn this sword 
upon my heart then force it impious 
have do all fair service to his lord 
now to be employ in this foul villainy 
thus must we do who be enthral to king 
whether they will just or unlawful thing 
but now Parmenio o methinks I see 
thou walk in the artificial grove 
of pleasant Susis when I come to thou 
and thou remember all our ancient love 
haste to embrace i say o my friend 
my dear Polidamas welcome my friend 
well be thou come that we may sit and chat 
of all the old adventure we have run 
it be long Polidamas since we two meet 
how do my sovereign lord how do my son 
when I vile wretch while my answer he attend 
with this hand give the letter this hand end 
his speak joy and stabb he to the heart 
and thus Parmenio thou reward art 
for all thy service thou that do agree 
for Alexander to kill Attalus 
for Alexander I must now kill thou 
such be the judgment of the heavenly power 
we other ruin work and other we 

why this be right now Alexander take 
the course of power this be a persian trick 
this be our way here public trial make 
no doubtful noise but bury clamour quick 

Indeed now Persia have no cause to rue 
for you have we undo who undo you 

this work be do the sad catastrophe 
of this great act of blood be finish now 
Philotas end have the tragedy 

now good my friend I pray thou tell we how 

as willing to relate as you to hear 
a fullcharged heart be glad to find a ear 
the council be dismiss from hence and go 
still Craterus ply the king still in his ear 
still whisper to he private alone 
urge it seem a quick dispatch of fear 
for they who speak but private to king 
do seldom speak the best and fit thing 
some will have have he forthwith stone to death 
accord to the macedonian course 
but yet that will not satisfy the breath 
of busy rumour but will argue force 
there must be some confession make within 
that must abroad more satisfaction win 
Craterus with Caenus and Ephestion 
do main urge to have he torture 
whereto the king consent and there upon 
they three be send to see it accomplish 
rack iron fire the grisly torturer 
stand hideous prepare before his face 
Philotas all unmoved unchanged appear 
as he will death ugly brow outface 
and scorn the worst of force and ask they why 
they stay to torture the king enemy 

that part be act well God grant we hear 
no worse a scene then this and all go clear 
so shall worth act and they who dare to fight 
against corrupt time shall die upright 
such heart king may dissolve but not defeat 
a great man where he fall he shall lie great 
who ruin like the sacred carcass 
of scatter temple which still reverent lie 
and the religious honour they no less 
than if they stand in all their gallantry 
but on with thy report 

straight be hotiron apply to sear his flesh 
then wrest rack his comely body strain 
then iron whip and then the rack afresh 
then fire again and then the whip again 
which he endure with so resolve a look 
as if his mind be of another side 
then of his body and his sense for sooke 
the part of nature to be whole tie 
to honour that he will not once consent 
so much as with a sight he punishment 

yet do he like himself yet all be well 
this argument no tyrant can refel 
this plea of resolution win his cause 
more right than all more admiration draw 
for we love nothing more than to renown 
man stout miserable high down 

but now 

we fear that but o if he aught descend 
leave here and let the tragedy here end 
let not the least act now of he at last 
mar all his act of life and glory past 

I must tell all and therefore give nigh leave 
swell with raw tumour ulcer with the jerk 
of iron whip that flesh from bone have raze 
and no part free from wound it irk 
his soul to see the house so foul deface 
wherein his life have dwell so long time clean 
and therefore crave he they will now dismiss 
his grievous torture and he will begin 
to open all wherein he have do amiss 
straight be his torture cease and after they 
have let he to recover sense he say 
now Craterus say what you will have i say 
wherewith as if delude or delay 
cratetus in wrath call present again 
to have the torture to be reapply 
when whatsoever secret of his heart 
which have be foreconceived but in a thought 
what friend soever have but take his part 
in common love he accuse and so forget 
himself that now he be more forward to 
confess than they to urge he thereunto 
whether affliction have his spirit undo 
or see to hide or utter be all one 
both way lay death and therefore he will vie 
now to be sure to say enough to die 
and then begin his fortune to deplore 
humble beseech they who he scorn before 
that Alexander where he stand behind 
a Travers out of sight be hear to speak 
I never think a man that have a mind 
to attempt so much have have a heart so weak 
there he confess that one Hegelochus 
when first the king proclaim himself jove son 
incense his father heart against he thus 
by tell he that now we be undo 
if we endure that he which do disdain 
to have be Philip son shall live and reign 
he that above the state of man will strain 
his style and will not be that which we be 
not only we contemn but do disdain 
the god themselves with who he will compare 
we have lose Alexander lose say he 
the king and fall on pride and vanity 
and we have make a god of our own blood 
that glorify himself neglect our good 
intolerable be this impious deed 
to god who he will match to man he will exceed 
thus have overnight Hegelochus 
discourse my father send next day 
for i to hear the same and there to we 
all he have say to he make he resay 
suppose out of wine the night before 
he may but idly rave when he again 
far more enrage in heat and passion more 
urge we to clear the state of such a stain 
conjure we to redeem the commonweal 
and do like man or else as man conceal 
Parmenio think while yet Darius stand 
this course be out of season and thereby 
the extinguish of Alexander blood 
will now not profit we but the enemy 
but he once dead we seize the other power 
may make all the orient and all Asia we 
that course we like to that our council stand 
thereto we tie our oath and give our hand 
and as for this he say for Dymnus plot 
though he be clear yet now it clear he not 
and yet the force of rack at last can do 
so much with he as he confess that too 
And say that fear Bactra will detain 
the king too long he hasten on his end 
lest that his father lord of such a train 
and such a wealth a who the whole depend 
shall be age by his death prevent 
these his design and frustrate his intent dum inficiatus eft facinus crudeliter torquerividebatur post confession Philotas ne amicorü quidem misericordiam meruit 

o will we have not hear this latter jar 
this all his former strain of worth do mar 
before this last his foe his spirit commend 
but now he be unpitied of his friend 

then be Demetrius likewise bring in place 
and put to torture who deny the deed 
Philotas he aver it to his face 
Demetrius still deny than he espy 
a youth one calm that be stand by 
Calin say he how long will thou abide 
Demetrius vain to avouch a lie 
the youth that never have be name before 
in all his torture give they cause to guess 
Philotas care not now to utter more 
than have be privy to his practise 
And see they have as much as they desire 
they with Demetrius stone he unto death 
and all who Dymnus name to have conspire 
with grievous torture now must lose their breath 
and all that be ally which can not fly 
be in the hand of justice now to die 

what must the punishment arrive beyond 
the offence not with the offender make a end 

they all must die who may be fear in time 
to be the heir unto their kindred crime 
all other punishment end with our breath 
but treason be pursue beyond our death 

the wrath of king do seldom measure keep 
seek to cure bad part they lance too deep 
when punishment like lightning shall appear 
to few man hurt but unto all man fear 
great elephant and lion murder least 
the ignoble beast be the most cruel beast 
but all be well if by the mighty fall 
of this great man the king be safe free 
but if this Hydra of ambition shall 
have other head to spring up in his stead 
then have he make but way for they to rise 
who will assault he with fresh treachery 
the which may teach we to observe this strain 
to admire high hill but live within the plain
