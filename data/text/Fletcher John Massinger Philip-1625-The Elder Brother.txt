which my care to advance thou shall confirm 
all that I aim at be to win thou from 
the practice of a idle foolish state 
use by great woman who think any labour 
though in the service of themselves a blemish 
to their fair fortune 

make i understand sir 
what it be you point at 

at the custom how 
virgin of wealthy family waste their youth 
after a long sleep when you wake your woman 
present your breakfast then you sleep again 
then rise and be trim up by other hand 
you be lead to dinner and that end either 
to card or to your couch as if you be 
bear without motion after this to supper 
and then to bed and so your life run round 
without variety or action daughter

from this idleness

with wholesome exercise guard both from danger 
I will have thou rise with the sun walk dance or hunt 
visit the grove and spring and learn the virtue 
of plant and simple do this moderate 
and thou shall not with eat chalk or coal 
leather and oatmeal and such other trash

with your pardon

prescribe a remedy for my lady health 
and her delight too far transcend those 
your lordship but now mention 

what be it Sylvia

as you say with the sun and so pipe to she 
as she will dance never doubt it and hunt with she

Well say wench 

and who give you commission to deliver 
your verdict minion 

I deserve a fee 
and not a frown dear madam I but speak 
her thought my lord and what her modesty 
refuse to give voice to show no mercy 
to a maidenhead of fourteen but off with it 
let she lose no time sir father that deny 
their daughter lawful pleasure when ripe for they 
in some kind edge their appetite to taste of 
the fruit that be forbid 

it be well urge 
and I approve it no more blush girl 
thy woman have speak truth and so prevent 
what I mean to move to thou there dwell near we 
a gentleman of blood monsieur Brisac 
of a fair state six thousand crown per annum 
the happy father of two hopeful son 
of different breed the elder a mere scholar 
the young a quaint courtier 

sir I know they 
by public fame though yet I never see they 
and that oppose antipathy between 
their various disposition render they 
the general discourse and argument 
one part incline to the scholar Charles 
the other side prefer Eustace as 
a man complete in courtship 

and which way 
if of these two you be to choose a husband 
do your affection sway you 

to be plain sir 
since you will teach i boldness as they be 
simple themselves to neither let a courtier 
be never so exact let he be bless with 
all part that yield he to a virgin gracious 
if he depend on other and stand not 
on his own bottom though he have the mean 
to bring his mistress to a masque or by 
conveyance from some great one lip to taste 
such favour from the king or grant he purchase 
precedency in the country to be swear 
a servant extraordinary to the queen 
nay though he live in expectation of 
some huge preferment in reversion if 
he want a present fortune at the best 
those be but glorious dream and only yield he 
a happiness in posse not in esse 
nor can they fetch he silk from the mercer nor 
discharge a tailor bill nor in full plenty 
which still preserve a quiet bed at home 
maintain a family 

apt consider 
and to my wish but what be thy censure of 
the scholar 

troth if he be nothing else 
as of the courtier all his song and sonnet 
his anagram acrostic epigram 
his deep and philosophical discourse 
of nature hide secret make not up 
a perfect husband he can hardly borrow 
the star of the celestial crown to make i 
a tire for my head nor Charles wain for a coach 
nor Ganymede for a page nor a rich gown 
from Juno wardrobe nor will I lie in 
for I despair not once to be a mother 
under heaven spangle canopy or banquet 
my guest and gossip with imagine nectar 
pure Orleans will do better no no father 
though I can be well please to have my husband 
a courtier and a scholar young and valiant 
these be but gawdy nothing if there be not 
something to make a substance 

and what be that 

a full estate and that say I have say all 
and get i such a one with these addition 
farewell virginity and welcome wedlock 

but where be such one to be meet with daughter 
a black swan be more common you may wear 
grey tress ere we find he 

I be not 
so punctual in all ceremony I will bate 
two or three of these good part before I will dwell 
too long upon the choice 

only my lord remember 
that he be rich and active for without these 
the other yield no relish but these perfect 
you must bear with small fault madam 

merry wench 
and it become you well I will to Brisac 
and try what may be do in the mean time home 
and feast thy thought with the pleasure of a bride 

thought be but airy food sir let she taste they 

unload part of the library and make room 
for the other dozen of cart I will straight be with you 

why have he more book 

more than ten mart send over 

and can he tell their name 

their name he have they 
as perfect as his pater noster but that be nothing 
he have read they over leaf by leaf three thousand time 
but here be the wonder though their weight will sink 
a spanish carrack without other ballast 
he carry they all in his head and yet 
he walk upright 

sure he have a strong brain 

if all thy pipe of wine be fill with book 
make of the bark of tree or mystery write 
in old motheaten vellum he will sip thy cellar 
quite dry and still be thirsty then for his diet 
he eat and digest more volume at a meal 
than there will be lark though the sky shall fall 
devour in a month in Paris yet fear not 
son of the the buttery and kitchen though his learned stomach 
can be appease he will seldom trouble you 
his know stomach contemn your black jack butler 
and your flagon and cook thy boil thy roast thy bake 

how live he 

not as other man do 
few prince fare like he he break his fast 
with Aristotle dine with Tully take 
his water with the Muse sup with Livy 
then walk a turn or two in via lactea 
and after six hour conference with the star 
sleep with old erra pater

and another old ignorant elder I will upon they

no hour of interruption 

Plato differ 
from Socrates in this 

Come lay they by 
let they agree at leisure 

man life sir be 
so short and then the way that lead unto 
the knowledge of ourselves so long and tedious 
each minute shall be precious 

in our care 
to manage worldly business you must part with 
this bookish contemplation and prepare 
yourself for action to thrive in this age 
be hold the palm of learning you must study 
to know what part of my land be good for the plough 
and what for pasture how to buy and sell 
to the best advantage how to cure my ox 
when they be overgrow with labour 

I may do this 
from what I have read sir for what concern tillage 
who better can deliver it than Virgil 
in his georgic and to cure your herd 
his bucolic be a masterpiece but when 
he do describe the commonwealth of bee 
their industry and knowledge of the herb 
from which they gather honey with their care 
to place it with decorum in the hive 
their government among themselves their order 
in go forth and come load home 
their obedience to their king and his towards 
to such as labour with his punishment 
only inflict on the slothful drone 
I be ravish with it and there reap my harvest 
and there receive the gain my cattle bring i 
and there find wax and honey 

and grow rich 
in your imagination heyday heyday 
georgic and bucolic and bee be mad 

no sir the knowledge of these guard i from it 

but can you find among your bundle of book 
and put in all your dictionary that speak all tongue 
what pleasure they enjoy that do embrace 
a well shape wealthy bride answer i that 

it be frequent sir in story there I read of 
all kind of virtuous and vicious woman 
the ancient spartan dame and Roman lady 
their beauty and deformity and when 
I light upon a Portia or Cornelia 
crown with still flourish leaf of truth and goodness 
with such a feeling I peruse their fortune 
as if I then have live and free taste 
their ravish sweetness at the present love 
the whole sex for their goodness and example 
but on the contrary when I look on 
a Clytaemnestra or a Tullia 
the first bathe in her husband blood the late 
without a touch of piety drive on 
her chariot over her father breathless trunk 
horror invade my faculty and compare 
the multitude of the guilty with the few 
that do die innocent I detest and loathe they 
as ignorance or atheism 

you resolve then 
never to make payment of the debt your owe i 

what debt good sir 

a debt I pay my father 
when I beget thou and make he a grandsire 
which I expect from you 

the child sir

beget and bring up by my painful study 
shall be my live issue 

very well 
and I shall have a general collection 
of all the quiddit from Adam to this time 
to be my grandchild 

and such a one I hope sir 
as shall not shame the family 

nor will you 
take care of my estate 

but in my wish 
for know sir that the wing on which my soul 
be mount have long since bear she too high 
to stoop to any prey that soar not upward 
sordid and dunghill mind compose of earth 
in that gross element fix all their happiness 
but pure spirit purge and refine shake off 
that clog of humane frailty give i leave 
to enjoy myself that place that do contain 
my book the best companion be to i 
a glorious court where hourly I converse 
with the old sage and philosopher 
and sometime for variety I confer 
with king and emperor and weigh their counsel 
call their victory if unjust get 
unto a strict account and in my fancy 
deface their ill place statue can I then 
part with such constant pleasure to embrace 
uncertain vanity no be it your care 
to augment your heap of wealth it shall be my

and I a looker on if we have study 
our major and our minor antecedent 
and consequent to be conclude coxcomb

than when to cut your vine and cozen merchant 
and choke your hidebound tenant with musty harvest

I be not come to my pace yet 
because he have make his study all his pleasure 
and be retire into his contemplation

because he have be at court and learned new tongue 
and how to speak a tedious piece of nothing 
to vary his face as seaman do their compass

therefore must he jump into his brother land 

have you do yet and have you speak enough 
in praise of learning sir 

never enough 

but brother do you know what learning be 

it be not to be a justice of peace as you be 
and palter out your time in the penal statute 
to hear the curious tenet controvert 
between a protestant constable and a Jesuit cobbler 
to pick natural philosophy out of bawdry 
when your worship be please to correctify a lady 
nor it be not the main moral of blind justice 
which be deep learning when your worship tenant 
bring a light cause and heavy hen before you 
both fat and feasible a goose or big 
and than you sit like equity with both hand 
weigh indifferent the state of the question 
these be your quodlibet but no learning brother

that I will be glad to know what you understand brother 
I be sure you have read all Aristotle

and that be it make a gentleman of my sort 
though I can speak no greek I love the sound on it

and hang they self for joy thou have such a gentleman 
to be thy son oh he have read such thing

sufficient to confirm a honest man 
good brother Brisac do your young courtier 
that wear the fine clothes and be the excellent gentleman 
the traveller the soldier as you think too 
understand any other power than his tailor 
or know what motion be more than a horserace 
what the moon mean but to light he home from tavern 
or the comfort of the sun be but to wear slash clothes in 
and must this piece of ignorance be pop up 
because it can kiss the hand and cry sweet lady 
say it have be at Rome and see the relic 
drink your Verdea wine and rid at Naples 
bring home a box of Venice treacle with it 
to cure young wench that have eat ash 
must this thing therefore

I will not trust my land to one so sot 
so grow like a disease unto his study 
he that will fling off all occasion 
and care to make he understand what state be 
and how to govern it must by that reason 
be fling himself aside from manage 
my young boy be a fine gentleman

so I have need 
and have a elder wit thou will shame we all else

out of the metaphysic or can all 
his learned astronomy look to my vineyard 
can the drunken old poet make up my vine 
I know they can drink they or your excellent humanist 
sell they the merchant for my best advantage 
can history cut my hay or get my corn in 
and can geometry vent it in the market 
shall I have my sheep keep with a jacob staff now 
I wonder you will magnify this mad man 
you that be old and shall understand 

shall say thou 
thou monstrous piece of ignorance in office 
thou that have no more knowledge than thy clerk infuse 
thy dapper clerk lard with end of latin 
and he no more than custom of offence 
thou unreprieveable dunce that thy formal bandstring 
thy ring nor pomander can expiate for 
do thou tell i I shall I will pose thy worship 
in thy own library and almanac 
which thou be daily pore on to pick out 
day of iniquity to cozen fool in 
and full moon to cut cattle do thou taint i 
that have run over story poetry

I will assure you gentleman my tailor have travail 
and speak as lofty language in his bill too 
the cover of a old book will not show thus 
fie fie what thing these academic be 
these bookworm how they look 

the be mere image 
no gentle motion nor behaviour in they 
they will prattle you of primum mobile 
and tell a story of the state of heaven 
what lord and lady govern in such house 
and what wonder they do when they meet together 
and how they spit snow fire and hail like a juggler 
and make a noise when they be drink which we call thunder 

they be the sneak thing and the contemptible 
such small beer brain but ask they any thing 
out of the element of their understanding 
and they stand gape like a roast big 
do they know what a court be or a council 
or how the affair of Christendom be manage 
do they know any thing but a tire hackney 
and they cry absurd as the horse understand they 
they have make a fair youth of your elder brother 
a pretty piece of flesh 

I thank they for it 
long may he study to give i his state 
see you my mistress

but be sure you keep she from learning 

song she 
may have and read a little unbaked poetry 
such as the dabbler of our time contrive 
that have no weight nor wheel to move the mind 
nor indeed nothing but a empty sound 
she shall have clothes but not make by geometry 
horse and coach but of no immortal race 
I will not have a scholar in my house 
above a gentle reader they corrupt 
the foolish woman with their subtle problem 
I will have my house call ignorance to fright

the spite on it be that much about that time 
I shall be argue or decide rather 
which be the male and female of red herring 
and whether they be take in the red sea only 
a question find out by Copernicus 
the learned motionmaker 

I marry butler 
here be rare thing a man that look upon he 
will swear he understand no more than we do 

certain a learned Andrew 

I have so much on it 
and be so load with strong understanding 
I fear they will run i mad here be a new instrument 
a metamatical glister to purge the moon with 
when she be lade with cold phlegmatic humour 
and here be another to remove the star 
when they grow too thick in the firmament 

o heaven why do I labour out my life 
in a beefpot and only search the secret 
of a salad and know no far 

they be not 
reveal to all bead these be far above 
your element of fire cook I can tell you 
of Archimedes glass to fire your coal with 
and of the philosopher turf that never go out 
and Gilbert butler I can ravish thou 
with two rare invention 

what be they Andrew 

the one to blanch your bread from chip base 
and in a moment as thou will a almond 
the sect of the epicurian invent that 
the other for thy trencher that be a strong one 
to cleanse you twenty dozen in a minute 
and no noise hear which be the wonder Gilbert 
and this be out of Plato new idea 

why what a learned master do thou serve Andrew 

these be but the scrape of his understanding Gilbert 
with god and goddess and such strange people 
he deal and treat with in so plain a fashion 
as thou do with thy boy that draw thy drink 
or Ralph there with his kitchen boy and scalder 

but why shall he not be familiar and talk sometime 
as other Christian do of hearty matter 
and come into the kitchen and there cut his breakfast 

and then retire to the buttery and there eat it 
and drink a lusty bowl my young master 
that must be now the heir will do all these 
I and be drink too these be mortal thing 

my master study immortality

the season of the year find no fond parent 
yet some be arm in silver ice that glister 
and some in gawdy green come in like masquer 
the silkworm spin her own suit and her lodging 
and have no aid nor partner in her labour 
why shall we care for any thing but knowledge 
or look upon the world but to contemn it 
will you have anything

and soon lose the day than leave a doubt 
distil the sweetness from the poet spring 
and learn to love thou know not what fair be 
traverse the story of the great hero 
the wise and civil life of good man walk through 
thou have see nothing but the face of country 
and bring home nothing but their empty word 
why shall thou wear a jewel of this worth 
that have no worth within thou to preserve she 
beauty clear and fair 
where the air 
rather like a perfume dwell 
where the violet and the rose 
their blue vein in blush disclose 
and come to honour nothing else 
where to live near 
and plant there 
be to live and still live new 
where to gain a favour be 
more than light perpetual bliss 
make i live by serve you 
dear again back recall 
to this light 
a stranger to himself and all

and what maintain she when she be woo I will stop here 
a wilful poverty never make a beauty

the rosy sugar morn never break so sweet 
I be a man and have desire within i 
affection too though they be drown a while 
and lie dead till the spring of beauty raise they 
till I see those eye I be but a lump 
a chaos of confusedness dwell in i 
then from those eye shoot love and he distinguish 
and into form he draw my faculty 
and now I know my land and now I love too 

we have best remove the maid 

it be too late sir 
I have her figure here nay frown not Eustace 
there be less worthy soul for young brother 
this be no form of silk but sanctity 
which wild lascivious heart can never dignify 
remove she where you will I walk along still 
for like the light we make no separation 
you may soon part the billow of the sea 
and put a bar betwixt their fellowship 
than blot out my remembrance soon shut 
old time into a den and stay his motion 
wash off the swift hour from his downy wing 
or steal eternity to stop his glass 
than shut the sweet idea I have in i 
room for a elder brother pray give place sir 

have study duel too take heed he will beat thou 
have fright the old justice into a fever 
I hope he will disinherit he too for a ass 
for though he be grave with year he be a great baby

old man be not immortal as I take it 
be it you look for youth and handsomeness 
I do confess my brother be a handsome gentleman 
but he shall give i leave to lead the way lady 
can you love for love and make that the reward 
the old man shall not love his heap of gold 
with a more dote superstition 
than I will love you the young man his delight 
the merchant when he plough the angry sea up 
and see the mountain billow fall on he 
as if all element and all their anger 
be turn into one vow destruction 
shall not with great joy embrace his safety 
we will live together like two wanton vine 
circle out soul and love in one another 
we will spring together and we will bear one fruit 
one joy shall make we smile and one grief mourn 
one age go with we and one hour of death 
shall shut our eye and one grave make we happy 

and one hand seal the match I be you for ever 

nay stay stay stay 

nay certain it be do sir 

there be a contract 

only conditional 
that if he have the land he have my love too

pray be not angry sir at what I say 
or if you be it be at your own adventure

but by my troth your inside be but barren

a reasonable hunt face to court the wind with 
nor the be not word unless they be well place too 
nor your sweet dam I nor your hire verse 
nor tell i of clothes nor coach and horse

nor your black patch you wear various

all which but show you still a young brother 

gramercy wench thou have a noble soul too 

nor your long travail nor your little knowledge 
can make i dote upon you faith go study 
and glean some goodness that you may show manly

or only study how to get a wife sir

and it be the fashion to wear your arm in a scarf sir 
for you have have a shrewd cut over the finger 

but be you in earnest

and the shadow of the earth eclipse your judgement

and you must give i leave to take my now sir

and then they sit in council what to do 
and then they jar again what shall be do 
they talk of warrant from the parliament 
complaint to the king and force from the province 
they have a thousand head in a thousand minute 
yet never a one head worth a head of garlic 

long may they chafe and long may we laugh at they 
a couple of pure puppy yoke together

how much they think I know not they look rueful 
as if they have new come from a vault house 
and have be quite shoot through between wind and water 
by a she dunkirk and have spring a leak sir 
certain my master be too blame 

why Andrew 

to take away the wench of the sudden from he 
and give he no lawful warn he be tender 
and of a young girl constitution sir 
ready to get the green sickness with conceit 
have he but take his leave in travail language 
or buy a elegy of his condolement 
that the world may have take notice he have be 
a ass it have be some savour 

thou say true 
wise Andrew but those scholar be such thing 
when they can prattle 

very perilous thing sir 

and when they gain the liberty to distinguish 
the difference betwixt a father and a fool 
to look below and spy a young brother 
prune and dress up his expectation 
in a rare glass of beauty too good for he 
those dream scholar then turn tyrant Andrew 
and show no mercy 

the more be the pity sir

and anger he a little far Andrew 
it shall be only anger I assure thou 
and a little shame 

and I can fit you sir

his uncle too be absent and it be night 
and what these opportunity may teach he 
what fear and endless care it be to be honest 
to be a maid what misery what mischief 
will I be rid of it so it be fair 

you need not fear that will you be a child still 
he follow you but still to look upon you 
or if he do desire to lie with you 
it be but your own desire you love for that end 
I will lay my life if he be now abed with you 
he be so modest he will fall asleep straight 

dare you venture that 

let he consent and have at you 
I fear he not he know not what a woman be 
nor how to find the mystery man aim at 
be you afraid of your own shadow madam 

he follow still yet with a sober face 
will I may know the worst and then I be satisfy

when like a modest bride he draw night curtain 
even then he blush that man shall behold he

it be easy do if you will give your mind to it 

pray you to your bed 

why not to you dear mistress 
one heart and one bed 

true sir when it be lawful 
but yet you know 

I will not know forget it 
those be but sickly love that hang on ceremony 
nurse up with doubt and fear we high and healthful 
full of belief and fit to teach the priest 
love shall seal first then hand confirm the bargain 

I shall be a heretic if this continue 
what will you do abed you make i blush sir 

I will see you sleep for sure your sleep be excellent 
you that be wake such a note wonder 
must in your slumber prove a admiration 
I will behold your dream too if it be possible

where all the perfume and the precious thing 
that wait upon great nature be lay up 
I will clip it in my arm and chaste kiss it 
dwell in your bosom like your dear thought 
and sigh and weep

yet I have read of virtuous temperance 
and study it among my other secret 
and soon will I force a separation 
betwixt this spirit and the case of flesh

and talk of any thing 
any thing fit for your ear and my language 
though I be breed up dull I be ever civil 
it be true I have find it hard to look on you 
and not desire it will prove a wise man task 
yet those desire I have so mingle still 
and temper with the quality of honour 
that if you shall yield I shall hate you for it 
I be no courtier of a light condition 
apt to take fire at every beauteous face 
that only serve his will and wantonness 
and let the serious part of life run by 
as thin neglect sand whiteness of name 
you must be i why shall I rob myself 
of that that lawful must make i happy 
why shall I seek to cuckold my delight 
and widow all those sweet I aim at in you 
we will lose ourselves in Venus grove of myrtle 
where every little bird shall be a Cupid 
and sing of love and youth each wind that blow 
and curl the velvet leave shall breed delight 
the wanton spring shall call we to their bank 
and on the perfume flower we will feast our sense 
yet we will walk by untainted of their pleasure 
and as they be pure temple we will make in they 

to bed and pray then we may have a fair end 
of our fair love will I be worthy of you 
or of such parent that may give you thanks 
but I be poor in all but in your love

and do the court that shall be the example 
and oracle of the kingdom read to we 
no other doctrine 

none that thrive so well 
as that within my knowledge 

flattery rub out 
but since great man learn to admire themselves 
it be something crestfallen 

to be of no religion 
argue a subtle moral understanding 
and it be often cherish 

piety then 
and valour nor to do nor suffer wrong 
be there no virtue 

rather vice Eustace 
fight what be fight it may be in fashion 
among provant sword and buffjerkin man 
but with we that swim in choice of silk and tissue 
though in defence of that word reputation 
which be indeed a kind of glorious nothing 
to lose a dram of blood must needs appear 
as coarse as to be honest 

and all this 
you serious believe 

it be a faith 
that we will die in since from the black guard 
to the grim sir in office there be few 
hold other tenet 

now my eye be open 
and I behold a strong necessity 
that keep i knave and coward 

you be the wise 

nor can I change my copy if I purpose 
to be of your society 

by no mean 
Eust honour be nothing with you 

a mere bubble 
for what be grow common be no more regard 

my sword force from i too and still detain 
you think be no blemish 

get i a battoon 
it be twenty time more courtlike and less trouble 

and yet you wear a sword 

yes and a good one 
a Milan hilt and a Damascus blade 
for ornament no use the court allow it 

wil it not fight of itself 

I never try this 
yet I have wear as fair as any man 
I be sure I have make my cutler rich and pay 
for several weapon turkish and Toledo 
two thousand crown and yet can never light 
upon a fight one 

I will borrow this 
I like it well 

it be at your service sir 
a lath in a velvet scabbard will serve my turn 

and now I have it leave i you be infectious 
the plague and leprosy of your baseness spread 
on all that do come near you such as you 
render the throne of majesty the court 
suspect and contemptible you be scarab 
that batten in her dung and have no palate 
to taste her curious viand and like owl 
can only see her night deformity 
but with the glorious splendour of her beauty 
you be strike blind as mole that undermine 
the sumptuous building that allow you shelter 
you stick like run ulcer on her face 
and taint the pureness of her native candour 
and be bad servant cause your master goodness 
to be dispute of make you the court 
that be the abstract of all academy 
to teach and practice noble undertake 
where courage sit triumphant crown with laurel 
and wisdom load with the weight of honour 
a school of vice 

what sudden rapture be this 

a heavenly one that raise i from sloth and ignorance 
in which your conversation long have charm i 
carry i up into the air of action 
and knowledge of myself even now I feel 
but plead only in the courtsdefence 
though far short of her merit and bright lustre 
a happy alteration and full strength 
to stand her champion against all the world 
that throw aspersion on she 

sure he will beat we 
I see it in his eye 

a second Charles 
pray look not sir so furious 

recant 
what you have say you mongrel and lick up 
the vomit you have cast upon the court 
where you unworthy have have warmth and breed 
and swear that you like spider have make poison 
of that which be a save antidote 

we will swear any thing 

we honour the court 
as a most sacred place 

and will make oath 
if you enjoin we to it nor knave nor fool 
nor coward live in it 

except you two 
you rascal 

yes we be all these and more 
if you will have it so 

and that until 
you be again reform and grow new man 
you never presume to name the court or press 
into the porter lodge but for a penance 
to be discipline for your roguery and this do 
with true contrition 

yes sir 

you again 
may eat scrap and be thankful 

here be a cold breakfast 
after a sharp night walk 

keep your oath 
and without grumble vanish 

we be go sir 

may all the poorness of my spirit go with you 
the fetter of my thraldom be file off 
and I at liberty to right myself 
and though my hope in Angellina little 
my honour unto which compare she be nothing 
shall like the sun disperse those lower cloud 
that yet obscure and dim it not the name 
of brother shall divert i but from he 
that in the world opinion ruine i 
I will seek reparation and call he 
unto a strict account ha it be near day 
and if the muse friend rosecheeked Aurora 
invite he to this solitary grove 
as I much hope she will he seldom miss 
to pay his vow here to she I shall hazard 
to hinder his devotion the door open 
it be he most certain and by his side my sword 
bless opportunity 

I have oversleep myself 
and lose part of the morn but I will recover it 
before I go to bed I write some note 
within my tablebook which I will now consider 
ha what mean this what do I with a sword 
learned Mercury need not the aid of Mars and innocence 
be to itself a guard yet since arm ever 
protect art I may just wear and use it 
for since it be make my prize I know not how 
I be grow in love with it and can eat nor study 
and much less walk without it but I trifle 
matter of more weight ask my judgement 

now sir 
treat of no other theme I will keep you to it 
and see you expound it well 

Eustace 

the same sir 
your young brother who as duty bind he 
have all this night turn out of door attend 
to bid good morrow to you 

this not in scorn 
command i to return it will you aught else 

o much sir here I end not but begin 
I must speak to you in another strain 
than yet I ever use and if the language 
appear in the delivery rough and harsh 
you be my tutor must condemn yourself 
from who I learn it 

when I understand 
be it in what style you please what be your demand 
I shall endeavour in the self same phrase 
to make a answer to the point 

I come not 
to lay claim to your birthright it be your own 
and it be fit you enjoy it nor ask I from you 
your learning and deep knowledge though I be not 
a scholar as you be I know they diamond 
by your sole industry patience and labour 
force from steep rock and with much toil attend 
and but to few that prize their value grant 
and therefore without rival free wear they 

these not repine at as you seem to inform i 
the motion must be of a strange condition 
if I refuse to yield to it therefore Eustace 
without this tempest in your look propound it 
and fear not a denial 

I require then 
as from a enemy and not a brother 
the reputation of a man the honour 
not by a fair war win when I be wake 
but in my sleep of folly ravish from i 
with these the restitution of my sword 
with large acknowledgement of satisfaction 
my coach my horse I will part with life 
ere lose one hair of they and what conclude all 
my mistress Angellina as she be 
before the musical magic of thy tongue 
enchant and seduce she these perform 
and with submission and do public 
at my father and my uncle intercession 
that I put in too I perhaps may listen 
to term of reconcilement but if these 
in every circumstance be not subscribe to 
to the last gasp I defy thou 

these be strict 
condition to a brother 

my rest be up 
nor will I give less 

I be not gamester Eustace 
yet I can guess your resolution stand 
to win or lose all I rejoice to find you 
thus tender of your honour and that at length 
you understand what a wretched thing you be 
how deep wound by yourself and make 
almost incurable in your own hope 
the dead flesh of pale cowardice grow over 
your fester reputation which no balm 
or gentle unguent ever can make way to 
and I be happy that I be the surgeon 
that do apply those burn corrosive 
that render you already sensible 
oh the danger you be plunge in teach you 
and by a fair gradation how far 
and with what curious respect and care 
the peace and credit of a man within 
which you be think till now shall be prefer 
before a gawdy outside pray you fix here 
for so far I go with you 

this discourse 
be from the subject 

I will come to it brother 
but if you think to build upon my ruin 
you will find a false foundation your high offer 
teach by the master of dependency 
that by compound difference between other 
supply their own necessity with i 
will never carry it as you be my brother 
I will dispense a little but no more 
than honour can give way to nor must I 
destroy that in myself I love in you 
and therefore let not hope nor threat persuade you 
I will descend to any composition 
for which I may be censure 

you shall fight then 

with much unwillingness with you but if 
there be no evasion 

None 

hear yet a word 
as for the sword and other frippery 
in a fair way send for they you shall have they 
but rather than surrender Angellina 
or hear it again mention I oppose 
my breast unto loud thunder cast behind i 
all tie of nature 

she detain I be deaf 
to all persuasion 

guard thyself then Eustace 
I use no other rhetoric 

clash of sword 
so near my house brother oppose to brother 
here be no fence at halfsword hold hold 
Charles Eustace 

second he or call in more help 
come not between we I will not know nor spare you 
do you fight by the book 

it be you that wrong i off sir 
and sudden I will conjure down the spirit 
that I have raise in he 

never Charles 
till thou and in thy death be double in i 

I be out of breath yet trust not too much to it boy 
for if you pause not sudden and hear reason 
do kill your uncle do but that I be patient 
and not a choleric old tasty fool 
like your father I will dance a matachin with you 
shall make you sweat your best blood for it I will 
and it may be I will Charles I command thou 
and Eustace I entreat thou thou be a brave spark 
a true tough metal blade and I begin 
to love thou hearty give i a fight courtier 
I will cherish he for example in our age 
they be not bear every day 

you of late sir 
in i love learning 

true but take i with you Charles 
it be when young Eustace wear his heart in his breech 
and fight his battle in compliment and cringe 
when his understand wave in a flaunt feather 
and his best contemplation look no further 
than a new fashion doublet I confess then 
the lofty noise your greek make only please i 
but now he be turn a Oliver and a Rowland 
nay the whole dozen of peer be bind up in he 
let i remember when I be of his year 
I do look very like he and do you see 
my picture as I be then you will swear 
that gallant Eustace I mean now he dare fight 
be the true substance and the perfect figure 
nay nay no anger you shall have enough Charles 

sure sir I shall not need addition from he 

nor I from any this shall decide my interest 
though I be lose to all deserve man 
to all that man call good for suffer tame 
insufferable wrong and just slight 
by yield to a minute of delay 
in my revenge and from that make a stranger 
unto my father house and favour one whelm 
with all disgrace yet I will mount upward 
and force myself a fortune though my birth 
and breed do deny it 

seek not Eustace 
by violence what will be offer to you 
on easy composition though I be not 
ally unto your weakness you shall find i 
a brother to your bravery of spirit 
and one that not compel to it by your sword 
which I must never fear will share with you 
in all but Angellina 

noble say Charles 
and learn from my experience you may hear reason 
and never maim your fight for your credit 
which you think you have lose spare Charles and swinge i 
and sound three or four walk velvet cloak 
that be no sword to guard they yet deserve it 
thou be make up again 

all this be lipsalve 

it shall be heartsease Eustace ere I have do 
as for thy father anger now thou dare fight 
never fear it for I have the dowcets of his gravity 
fast in a string and will so pinch and wring he 
that spite of his authority thou shall make 
thy own condition with he 

I will take leave 
a little to consider 

here come Andrew 

but without his comical and learned face 
what sad disaster Andrew 

you may read sir 
a tragedy in my face 

be thou in earnest 

yes by my life sir and if now you help not 
and speedy by force or by persuasion 
my good old master for now I pity he be 
ruin for ever 

ha my father 

he sir 

by what mean speak 

at the suit of monsieur Lewis 
his house be seize upon and he in person 
be under guard I see it with these eye sir 
to be convey to Paris and there sentence 

nay then there be no jest 

do I live 
and know my father injure 

and what be worse sir 
my lady Angellina 

what of she 

she be carry away too 

how 

while you be absent 
a crew of monsieur Lewis friend and kinsman 
by force break in at the back part of the house 
and take she away by violence faithful Andrew 
as this can witness for he do his best 
in her defence but it will not do 

away 
and see our horse saddle it be no time 
to talk but do Eustace you now be offer 
a spacious field and in a pious war 
to exercise you valour here be a cause 
and such a one in which to fall be honourable 
your duty and reverence due to a father name 
command it but these unnatural jar 
arise between brother shall you prosper 
will shame your victory 

I will do much sir 
but still my reputation 

Charles shall give you 
all decent satisfaction nay join hand 
and hearty why this be do like brother 
and old as I be in this cause that concern 
the honour of our family monsieur Lewis 
if reason can work shall find and feel 
there be hot blood in this arm I will lead you brave 

and if I follow not a coward name 
be brand on my forehead 

this spirit make you 
a sharer in my fortune 

and in i 
of which Brisac once free and Angellina 
again in our possession you shall know 
my heart speak in my tongue 

I dare not doubt it sir 

I be deaf to all persuasion 

I use none 
nor doubt I though a while my innocence suffer 
but when the king shall understand how false 
your malice have inform he he in justice 
must set i right again 

sir let not passion 
so far transport you as to think in reason 
this violent course repair but ruin it 
that honour you will build up you destroy 
what you will seem to nourish if respect 
of my preferment or my reputation 
may challenge your paternal love and care 
why do you now good fortune have provide 
a better husband for i than your hope 
can ever fancy strive to rob i of he 
in what be my lord Charles defective sir 
unless deep learning be a blemish in he 
or well proportion limb be mulct in nature 
or what you only aim at large revenue 
be on the sudden grow distasteful to you 
of what can you accuse he 

of a rape 
do to honour which thy ravenous lust 
make thou consent to 

her lust you be her father 

and you her bawd 

be you ten lord it be false 
the pureness of her chaste thought entertain not 
such spot instrument 

as I have a soul sir 

I be not to be alter to sit down 
with this disgrace will argue i a peasant 
and not bear noble all rigour that the law 
and that increase of power by favour yield 
shall be with all severity inflict 
you have the king hand for it no bail will serve 
and therefore at your peril officer away with they 

this be madness 

tell i so in open court 
and there I will answer you 

well overtake 

ill if they dare resist 

he that advance 
but one step forward die 

show the king write 

show your discretion it will become you better 

you be once more in my power and if again 
I part with you let i for ever lose thou 

force will not do it nor threat accept this service 
from your despair of Eustace 

and beware 
your reverend worship never more attempt 
to search my lillypot you see what follow 

be the king power contemn 

no but the torrent 
of your wilful folly stop and for you good sir 
if you will but be sensible what can you wish 
but the satisfaction of a obstinate will 
that be not endear to you rather than 
be cross in what you purpose you will undo 
your daughter fame the credit of your judgement 
and your old foolish neighbour make your state 
and in a suit not worth a cardecu 
a prey to advocate and their buckram scribe 
and after they have plume you return home 
like a couple of naked fowl without a feather 

this be a most strong truth sir 

no no monsieur 
let we be right Frenchman violent to charge 
but when our folly be repel by reason 
it be fit that we retreat and never come on more 
observe my learned Charles he will get thou a nephew 
on Angellina shall dispute in her belly 
and suck the nurse by logic and here be Eustace 
he be a ass but now be grow a Amadis 
nor shall he want a wife if all my land 
for a jointure can effect it you be a good lord 
and of a gentle nature in your look 
I see a kind consent and it show lovely 
and do you hear old fool but I will not chide 
hereafter like i ever dote on learning 
the mere belief be excellent it will save you 
and next love valour though you dare not fight 
yourself or fright a foolish officer young Eustace 
can do it to a hair and to conclude 
let Andrew farm be increase that be your penance 
you know for what and see you rut no more 
you understand i so embrace on all side 
I will pay those billman and make large amends 
provide we preserve you still our friend
