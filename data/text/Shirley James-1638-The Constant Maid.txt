into a heap I do not think he ever 
put off his clothes he will run mad to see 
his own anatomy that such a wretch 
shall have so vast a wealth 

I will not be his 
niece for all his fortune 

I presume 
your mother be more noble than to encourage he 
in his pretence and her estate will mix

I hear you make pretence 
of love to try he for my sake and pardon i

with resolution if I find he more 
a courtier of thy fortune than thy person 
to punish he with loss of both but love 
have change both scene and title in our comedy 
and what I mean shall shipwreck all his hope 
have ruine we his modest and calm answer 
to accept my tender with such force and reason 
direct to my fancy turn my purpose 
and make i his indeed his perfect lover

and rise without my blessing yet

Indeed I dare not yet can I 
put off the knowledge that you be a mother 

what then 

though in imagination I allow you 
the great woman in the earth who frown 
can kill and eye at pleasure make alive 
again I can say 

pray let we hear 

I dare tell you 
in confidence of my cause that you betray 
two innocent to sorrow and though heaven 
look on and seem to smile upon your cruelty 
yet there be punishment for divorce those 
who heart that have conjoin I dare tell you 
though all your terror be prepare to punish 
my bold defence you be a tyrant 

how 

a most unjust a sacrilegious tyrant 

you will not be so violent 

that thus 
not only ruin and deface the altar 
but steal away the very sacrifice 
and I dare add and smile upon your anger 
though as you frown death stand in every wrinkle 
my soul be above your tyranny and will 
from torture flame receive new fire of love 
and make your eye faint to behold the brightness 
of my poor body martyrdom and if ever 
love show a miracle my heart shall bear 
the character of he you have tear from it 
with beam about it like a saint that suffer 
but as you be my mother thus I kneel 
and beg a pardon for my innocence 
if that offend you live you happy still 
and be the mistress of your vow live to 
enjoy who you affect may every hour 
return new blessing on you both renew 
your spring and let he think you young again 
and let i beg but this for all my duty 
against that day you marry he to provide 
my coffin for I fear I shall not have 
breath many minute after to pray for you 
the herb that shall adorn your bridal chamber 
will serve my funeral and deck my hearse 
beneath which you shall say there lie your daughter 
that die to show obedience 

why shall thou 
continue thus to he 

I know he love i yet hereafter your affection 
may not 

but never procure thou one sad thought 
now I have try you both assure my child 
I love he but for thou dispose thyself 
to be his bride this news at his return 
will make all well to rest 

can this be true 

it be sin to mock thou any more to bed 

I will spend all night 
in prayer for you mother o my Hartwell exeunt 

I be bind ever to thou 

do she not become her rich clothes too 

the morning never look 
so fresh nor Venus with more charm upon she 
Adonis will melt before her eye and woo she 
her kiss at expense of his last breath 
Cupid himself can he but see will fall 
in love with she and throw away his shaft 
offer the empty quiver to her eye 
ambitious to fill it with her beam 
the least of which will wound more heart than ail 
his stock of golden arrow 

no more rapture 

do thou not know before that love be able 
without the help of sack to make a poet 
my nimble Mercury Jove herald in 
reversion 

I must confess 
I have a trick of Mercury when I pick 
his pocket for the key 

he never miss they 

his eye be drench in suds and I return they 
ere they recover light 

it be excellent 
he walk in darkness still 

do you think he will know she 

his clothes already have 
make he forget himself or if he have 
but the remembrance of such a woman 
the more he see she now the more he will think 
the change impossible 

where have you leave he 

in the gallery where with much patience 
he do expect his highness will send for he 

then all run smooth his wonder still continue 

I feed that humour artificial 
he be half persuade all be but a dream 
to which imagination his clothes 
be a great help because he pay not for they 
sometime he be very merry then again 
he strut about with such a scurvy pride 
as some new creep into nobility 
when man of their first livery come to see they 
his honour have so change he that he now 
know not of what religion he be 
or if he chance to think of his first faith 
he spit of the hang and excuse with 
I do not like the story it be apocryphal 
sometime he will offer at a jest and talk 
nonsense with he that have be seven year lord 
frown upon any man that will presume 
to have more knowledge in worse clothes I tell he 
it be his grace pleasure he shall be 
controller of the masque and he do sweat 
as he be study for some mighty oath 
to clear the presence he be here away Exit

Indeed the case be somewhat a 
alter by your highness bounty 
to your poor subject Hornet 

now he look 
as he do scorn the quorum and be hungry 
to eat a statesman alas a office in 
the household be too little for a breakfast 
a baron but a morning draught he will gulp it 
like a round egg in muscadine methinks 
at every wipe of his mouth shall drop 
a golden say of Pythagoras 
a piece of Machiavelli I see already 
hang on his beard which want but stroke out 
the statute and the magna charta have 
take a lease at his tongue end 

I will think on it

to help his scale which yet he may be indebt for 
to his father sin alive he can not merit 
one cold disdain from thou and dead how come it

a thousand or two thousand for six month 
upon security 

persecution

it be more safe to see she thus bestow 
than trust a jury if the doctor have 
give she too much opium or purge 
her soul away thing may so worse but I 
keep counsel

in woman petticoat and turn squire again 
to whore or parasite to noble man 
for want of fit provision
