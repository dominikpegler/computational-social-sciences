be you the author of this play 

what then 

out of this poetry I wonder what 
you do with this disease a seed of viper 
spawn in Parnassus pool who the world frown on 
and here you vent your poison on the stage 

what say you sir 

o you be deaf to all 
sound but a plaudite and yet you may 
remember if you please what entertainment 
some of your tribe have have that have take pain 
to be contemn and laugh at by the vulgar 
and then ascribe it to their ignorance 
I shall be loath to see you move their spleen 
with no better success and then with some 
commendatory epistle fly to the press 
to vindicate your credit 

what if I do 

by my consent I will have you 
banish the stage proscribe and interdict 
castalian water and poetical fire 

in that you wrong the approve judgment of 
this noble auditory who like a sphere 
move by a strong intelligence sit round 
to crown our infant muse who celestial 
applause she hear at her first entrance 

this way of poetry have deceive many 
for it be not every one that write a verse 
have wash his mouth in Helicon or sleep 
on the two top Parnassus there be great difference 
betwixt he that shall write a lawful poem 
and one that make a paper of loose verse 
to court his loose mistress there be much air 
require to lift up the dircaean swan 
when he shall print his tract among the cloud 
not as your ignorant poetaster use 
in spite of Phoebus without art or learning 
to usurp the stage and touch with impure hand 
the lofty buskin and the comic style 

this I confess but when the prosperous gale 
of their auspicious breath shall fill our sail 
and make our highborn thought swell like a tide 
and when our bold muse shall put on buskin 
and clap on her talaria on her foot 
then like swift Mercury she may aspire 
to a sublime region with that force 
and bear that weighty burden on her wing 
that she shall fear to crack her pinion 

it be this licentious generation 
of poet trouble the peace of the whole town 
a constable can get his maid with child 
a baker nor a scrivener lose his care 
nor a justice of peace share with his clerk 
a lord can it walk drink with a torch before he 
a gallant can it be suffer to pawn his breeches 
or leave his cloak behind he at a tavern 
but you must jerk he for it 

in all age 
it have be ever free for comic writer 
if there be any that be infamous 
for lust ambition or avarice 
to brand they with great liberty though I 
disclaim the privilege no impure language 
as stygian mud stir up with Charon oar 
never belch so foul a air shall ever mix 
with our ingenious mirth nor need we fear 
any their foul aspersion while the wise 
sit to control and judge in who clear eye 
as we deserve we look to stand or fall 
pass profane people and leave all 
to be determine as you censure boy 
go and subscribe it quick what I say 

he be grow contemptuous and fling away 
in a rapture for this when I be in 
if I can it laugh at his play I will laugh at he 

it be true indeed our love be like our life 
there be no man bless in either till his end 
and he who fate point to that happiness 
a thousand passion mock his doubtful hope 
till virtue that can never be extinct 
shall rise above their rage and call down Hymen 
attend with as many several joy 
to triumph in the circle of our brow 

but that the fatal union of our heart 
shall breed such issue of extremity 
in both our fortune yet the great grief 
I feel be in your wrong not in my own 

never think of it what though my father make i 
a stranger to his loin and cut i off 
from my inheritance because he think i 
a rival in his love that fatal love 
who jealousy prevail so in a wooer 
that it kill all affection in a father 
these ill beget thought he still maintain 
and cherish to his death who period 
of life be the begin of my mischief 
for he give all the land unto my brother 
one less deserve will I can report 
that he have any worth his ill wrought mind 
too apt for the impression of all vice 
as if he be to strive with his estate 
and have no other enemy will make 
a conquest of his ruin so negligent 
of what his father wrongful bereave i 
that he spend all in riot and so vain 
as if he mean to throw it after he 
only he have a foolish flash wit 
too weak to sustain or prevent his fall 
but no solidity of mind or judgement 
and now imagine he can salve it up 
by be style a fine companion 
let that entitle he to all my right 
while I secure in my impute crime 
think thou a better portion all my fault 
be honesty and true affection 

and those still envious fate insult upon 
but we will live together and whatever 
shall interpose to poison our true love 
still triumph over their malice 

dear Valeria 
have fortune please to place i in that mean 
my birth assure i we have spend our life 
lull in the lap of peace our day have run 
smooth as the foot of time free from all tumult 

and why not still 

it may do so but I 
have not a fortune equal to your virtue 
and to support the title of your worth 

my mind be never yet ambitious 
and there be nothing but your company 
can satisfy or limit my desire 

I love you better than to injure you 
I will resign you to some rich heir 
who heap of wealth leave by his greedy father 
untouched as be your goodness may advance you 
and make you happy think on it be not cruel 
to your owne selfe 

on how have I deserve that you shall think 
so ill of i you may divorce the luy 
the vine from her embrace i you can not 
where be the care you wont to have of i 
what be my fault you can be well without i 
and I shall please you best when I be absent 

nay my Valeria do not weep so sore 
thy grief add more to i it be enough 
I part from thou my heart with drop of blood 
pay tribute to the ocean of thy tear 
this treasure of thy eye if spend for those 
that lie unterred want their funeral rite 
and restless walk upon the stygian strand 
so long as fate have limit their curse 
will send they over to Elysium 
one grain of that same grief which clog her heart 
will lie in balance against the universe 
the joy and happiness of all mankind 
be give to i in she and she be bear 
to upbray the world and tell they they be false 

what shall I do when you be ravish from i 
can Portia rather swallow glow coal 
then burn with a desire of her lose Brutus 
shall the example of those time descend 
to shame my love can the egyptian queen 
rather endure the poignant sting of adder 
than that of death which wound Antony 
and must I then survive you can I live 
when you that be my soul be take from i 
o it be not now as when Penelope 
can stay ten year the come of her love 
and span a tedious web of foolish thought 
in expectation 

faith that flee to heaven 
and truth that after once man heart grow cold 
will go no long naked now again 
be come to dwell with mortal here be a woman 
in who comparison all wealth be sordid 
and since she prove so constant fate itself 
shall not be blame for i that I for sooke she 

be you so well resolve but I may cross you 

o i my father I be quite undo 
I be nobody 

yes you be the wicked 
the most ungracious child that ever live 
under so good a government but that 
shall turn to tyranny since your discretion 
can not distinguish of the difference

with tenderness and costly education 
to have you make a sacrifice to beggary 
to one that be cut off disinherit 
the son of the people

a bundle of blank love letter ready pen with as much vehemency of affection as I can get for money only want the superscription of their name to who they shall be direct which I can instant and with ease endorse upon acquaintance 

and so send they to your mistress 

you understand i I no soon fall into discourse with any lady but I profess myself ardent in love with she and be depart return my boy with one of these letter to second it as I say passionate decipher how much I languish for she which she can not but deep apprehend together with the quickness and promptitude of my ingenuity in the dispatch of it 

I will practise this device prithee let i see one of they what be here to the fair hand of

I will open it by your favour sir what be here most resplendent lady that may just be style the accomplishment of beauty the seat and mansion of all delight and virtue in who meet the joy and desire of the happy some man here perhaps may fear in praise your worth to heighten your disdain but I be force though to the peril of my neglect to acknowledge it for to this hour my curious thought and wander in the sphere of feminine perfection can never yet find out a subject like yourself that can so detain and command my affection 

and so it go on how do you like it 

admirable good put they up again

and censure by a arbitration 
before I do approve they I have search 
the dust of antiquity to find out 
the rare invention that I be verse in 
my several garb and posture of the body 
my rule for banquet and entertainment 
and for the titillation of my laughter 
buffoon and parasite for I must tell you 
I still affect a learned luxury 

you have a very complete suit on too methinks 

it be as fresh as the morning and that be the grace on it a new play and a gentleman in a new suit claim the same privilege at their first presentment their estimation be double 

and whither now do your employment direct you 

I take your lodging by the way I be go to dazzle the eye of the lady with my apparition 

I be not so conformable as I can wish or else I will attend you I take up a new man for pity sake some three day since to wait upon i which foolish sin I will abandon while I live for it he run away with two hundred pound the remnant of a mortgage and since that I be put to a new perplexity to supply i 

by this hand if you have speak but yesterday I can have furnish you 

why what a rare way be here now to engage a man for nothing I must study it 

how do your brother digest the loss of his inheritance 

very well sure for sometime he have nothing else to digest and he have enough of that too it stick in his stomach worse than a surfeit alas we land man be but fool to he it make he sober and wise very temperate

have she receive any of your letter 

yes twenty and nothing will prevail I have seek to corrupt she any time this twelvemonth and can do no good on she her father give i opportunity out of pretence of good will but I use it clean contrary for alas I can not love any wench far than to lie with she I can not fashion my tongue to speak in any other character I will not willing lose all this time and labour I will make short of it either work she to obedience or do she a mischief 

it be well resolve and there be her sister Aemilia she will glance sometime affectionate upon i be it not a mad thing when I have sell all my land to her father to get she into advantage I think that will be the end of it 

methinks lackwit her brother may stand thou in some stead for the conveyance 

well it be the true spaniel that I put a hundred jeer upon he and yet he love i the better I can pawn he as familiar as my cloak 

the time call upon i 

I will dismiss you will you present my service to the lady and excuse i

be it not well resolve captain 

yes by the soul of Hercules it be a good foresight to sell all and prevent misfortune the world be full of uncertainty land may be barren servant deceitful make money I say and what a man spend with his friend shall never perish 

I say by the heart of valour that man live best at ease that have no money at all 

what shall he do then lieutenant 

by the faith of a soldier for the exercise of his wit he may do any thing if all trade fail he may turn pimp it be a noble profession to live by if he can perform that office well he need ask no more of his genius 

body of i nor no better preferment

of Thessaly can ease my grief the sea

be there a way to it as deep with danger 
as to the centre I will search it out 
when I have nothing else to do 

your thought have find such easy utterance 
that I suspect their truth they seem to savour 
of art more than of passion I have hear 
great grief be silent neither do I find 
those symptom of affection in your look 
you change no colour and your joint be steady 
your eye appear too full of petulancy 
as if they do reflect with inward scorn 
to upbray your falsehood 

now by all my hope 
by all the rite that crown a happy union 
and by the rosy tincture of your cheek 
and by your all subdue eye more bright 
than heaven

I will swear there be no plague like love tyranny 
and all this while I do not care a pin for she

with bank full of delight a golden chain 
of wanton smile hang round about his neck 
and all his way before he strew with rose 
Come let we sit and dally taste those pleasure

and yet our dainty still remain as fresh 
as they be never touch

through all those way where to find the way 
will be to lose it 

I be very sorry

the only end to corrupt honesty 
to prostitute your oath and win our heart 
to your belief be the court eloquence

why shall you lose the benefit of youth 
and the delight give freedom to your will 
when age and weakness mortify your thought 
you may correct this looseness

and though you do impart you may retain it 

sir I have sum the account of all your care 
and I do find their number more than weight 
thing but of custom with you and your vow 
be but a cloud of wind and emptiness 
force by the storm of lust when it be over 
and your thought calm than you will love that virtue 
which as a tie and anchor do withhold you 
from drive to destruction so I leave you 

that ever any woman shall be virtuous 
I have enclose a fire within my breast 
will burn this frame of nature into cinder 
her beauty have surprise i I be catch 
in love by this light it be a mad jest now 
if I shall turn honest and woe she so 
if she persist I must do so believe it 
and hate myself as long as I live for it

well if they understand a woman true 
they will not seek to curb so who nature 
rejoice like a torrent to make way 
spite of impediment now if their wisdom 
shall let we alone we may perhaps ourselves 
find out the inconvenience and prevent it 
which they like a false perspective will seek 
to multiply upon we 

I shall never 
recall that faith which I have plight once 
to my Aurelio I will run all hazard 
and violent attempt to throw myself 
into his arm 

I will not have you leave he 
nor yet turn desperate now will I rather 
get he by some devise I love a witty 
and a ingenuous trick above my life 
and shall take more delight to overreach they 
then to enjoy my purpose 

but I dare not 
play with my fortune so nor trust adventure 
if fate will be so gracious to present 
a opportunity 

Come fear it not 
you see what a man they will put upon i 
may be my father he have less vigour in he 
than any catamite there be not reserve 
so much as one masculine grain in he 
a fellow that be as bald as a lookingglass 
and who disease be beyond arithmetic 
not a joint of he free a gouty numbness 
have seize his foot and finger and there be all 
the stiffness he have leave and be I marry 
I must spend all my life in rub of he 
with hot woollen clothes and apply plaster 
and cataplasm and trencher to his belly 
must undergo the person of a chirurgeon 
not of a wife and yet I be not terrify 
it move i not I make a jest of it 
because I mean to abuse they all and choose 
where I like best 

it be a happy spirit 
that rule in you I will I have one like it 

like i thou have not study thyself so well 
nor haste that season of thy mother in thou 
observe her fashion take example by they 
although her husband be penurious 
hard as the mettle that he dote upon 
yet she can make he malleable and work he 
and turn and hammer he and wiredraw he 
and rule he with as much correction 
as one will wish to govern for my part 
when I have stretch my brain make all the shift 
the wit of woman can be pregnant of 
And show my love by such experience 
as shall outstrip belief all for his sake 
that shall enjoy i which be master careless 
and when he have i if he shall presume 
on former passage of my affection 
to oversway i in the least desire 
to contradict and tempt my patience 
I will shake off all obedience and forget it 
I will slight he yet prevail 

alas my heart be 
tender and violable with the least weapon 
sorrow can dart at i 

you be a fool 
and every one that will can make you so 
when be your sweet heart master spruce here with you 

but late and present such a scene 
of protestation and then vary it 
so cunning that love and lust together 
be interweave with such subtle thread 
that I can scarce distinguish they 

take heed 
whatever he speak it tend but to corrupt you 
I will join commerce of language with a sphinx 
ere I will deign to answer he master careless 
tell i his humour seem he boast of it 
he give his character the most perfidious 
and love abuse creature in the world 
that all his vow be treacherous he smile 
his word and action like small rivulet 
through twenty turn of loose passion 
at last will run to the dead sea of sin 

whatever he say I resolve never to trust he 

be wise and constant and then govern fate 
and in the interim however matter fall 
we I find a trick wench how to cheat they all 

see here he come again 

I come sweet lady 
to rear the trophy of your conquest up 
and yield myself the great 

what be the matter 

your look have take i prisoner I be captive 
bind with the golden chain of your loose hair 
and on your frown depend my destiny 

it be about the old matter you may save 
this labour or go seek some new devise 
in faith these stale exordium can not take i 

Indeed my sister and I know you well enough 

but lady since my change you do not know i 
I be now metamorphize and that fancy 
that rove and be rebellious by her power 
be bring within command 

I so you tell i 

here I present a sad oblation 
a heart that bring its own fire with it 
and burn before your beauty deity 
offer up with as much devotion 
as ever true love sacrifice any 

well you may jest with mortal but I be not 
so blind but I can see through all your mist 
be I a goddess as you term i one 
sister to Phoebus or arm like Minirva 
I will transform you straight and fix you up 
a monument for your hypocrisy 

now by that sacred shrine bright than Venus 
to who I pay my orison that form 
that fair idea that rule all my thought 
thyself I mean that spotless seat of pleasure 
the continent of all perfection 
this spring of love that issue from my soul 
run in a stream as pure as be your virtue 
full fraught with zeal immaculate and free 
from all adulterate mixture 

on my life 
I can frame i to believe one word 

hold thy own there wench and I warrant thou 

Phoebus how have I anger thou to lay 
Cassandra curse on i that be not trust 
when she speak true and most prophetical 

sir he that be accustom to deceive 
gain this reward by it when he speak truth 
not to be credit 

observe i lady 
and mark the harmony do it not sound 
upon the string as if my heart keep touch 

and so it sound first to the same tune 

that be ill set this be a different passion 

but it be all show and nothing serious 

you can not judge by former evidence 
it be not fit proof to confirm this motion 
this be a true text that a false gloss of it 

but I shall never so interpret it 

what can I say more than to swear I love you 

but shall you now dissolve your eye to tear 
be every accent in your speech a sigh 
and every gesture every motion in you 
a hieroglyphic to commend that love 
have you the spell of it and magic charm 
set round about the circle of your arm 
to draw i to you I will seal my ear 
deaf as the sea to shipwrecked mariner 
and so I leave you to your better fortune 

be I despise and slight foolish girl 
the haste lose thyself that which be best in nature 
turn to the worst corruption my scorn love 
shall now convert to hatred it be decree 
fraud and revenge shall be my counsellor 
what be here a ring she lose it now I know it 
the same Aurelio wont to wear on we finger 
he send it as a gift it be so the poesy 
in love I write 
all my grief all my delight 
the very same be I best poison it 
and send it back to she no it shall serve 
to poison her good name there be no foul fact 
that love when it be injure dare not act 

Come honest Fido thy best love supply 
part of my hope fortune that be true friendship 
misery can shake which crown thy merit 

sir can my power produce forth any thing 
worthy your acceptation or my service 
I will with hazard of my life perform it 
so much I owe your virtue so much pity 
your injury but this poor task so easy 
consist more of policy than danger 
give not my love a equal testimony 

you can not do a office more deserve 
or grateful to my soul than to bring tiding 
how my love fare each syllable she speak 
though by a echo I receive the voice 
be able to inspire new life into i 
how do she be she well and mindful of we 
speak it a thousand time never do sound 
touch a more gladsome ear 

by all circumstance 
I can conjecture I read in her look 
a strange disturbance when I give the ring 
a letter to she as if joy and fear 
have run on several errand and return 
swift as her thought and speak her love in silence 

the have see the treasury of my happiness 
speak be I rich or no 

Shee be a i 
a storehouse of all beauty all content 
her brow a bank of pleasure her bright eye 
the chief and only mover of your love 
so multiply their flame that they appear 
to i most like a firmament of fire 
yet chaste than the vestal and below 
cloud with sorrow which drop pearl for you 
and do enclose a soul rich than it 
wherein be lock the wardrobe of all virtue 
yet sure that soul have leave her mansion 
but that she stay to bid you welcome thither 

and why shall I be stay from go to she 
why shall a covetous eye watch over that wealth 
that be my right I will go claim my due 
and justify the seizure why shall parent 
that can give to their child neither mind 
nor yet affection strive to govern both 
it be not justice yet where shall I complain 
love have no bar to plead at nor no law 
to rule we by nor court to judge our cause

with impudence 

yes do you observe he 
there be nothing can discountenance he still 
this be his posture he be excellent 
to venture at a lottery 

why mischief 

I do not think he will ever draw a blank 

we must pursue the project Sup with he 
at any hand 

the jest be behind to see 
in what a miserable perplexity 
he will be put to entertain we 

Come 

you know father for I must still call you so how you charge your daughter to use i respective 

yes marry do I and to show a double duty as may suit with the reverence of your age and honour of her husband 

well and as soon as you be go she have no more regard to i than if I have be a old horse or a old servingman 

why it be impossible she shall transgress in such a high point of humanity 

else there be some fury in her shape that do so I be sure she shape i out to be the ridiculous old ass in Europe 

her modesty will not permit it in she 

if my word have any weight in they she set as light by i as by the least feather in she fan 

why be this true Aemilia 

no indeed sir 

how not indeed do you deny it o palpable she reckon up a whole catalogue of abuse and malicious practise that she will assault i with if I be her husband the least of which be above all patience 

do you think sir if I intend any such thing I will have forewarn you 

no it be not likely 

that you have but hear the disgrace she put upon i in calumniate the vigour and ability of my person 

I can believe it 

and then terrify i that the wind of her humour shall be still against i to cross i in every thing I desire yet the course of my destiny shall be more impetuous than before 

the old gentleman do but dream so 

nay more she say I be a old dry stump that have not the least drop of moisture in i yet by the virtue of her humidity she will make my temple so supple that they shall sprout and bud afresh 

Come she will not say so 

yes and that all my estate shall be too little to maintain she in prodigality and invite acquaintance 

alas good gentleman I tell he how other woman use their husband but I will conform myself to obedience 

ay that you may know what a blessing you have in she 

o be it so I cry you mercy I mistake you here take this pearl for amends I be sorry I have sin against so sweet a simplicity 

Come I know you be in a error 

then to avoid all cavillation hereafter see what I have provide 

what have you there 

I have here a Syngraphus a writing with article that must be draw between we before there can be any copulation 

wherefore do you so 

look you sir I be in a little suspense of her behaviour and therefore in relation of that which I think she object yet have since prove to be otherwise notwithstanding these rule which may so much conduce to my happiness and have be so much advise upon with deliberation I will have establish 

pray let we hear they 

they be only some sew proposition and exception to be observe on her behalf for the better security of my quiet when I shall be marry to she 

now I conceive you read they out 

first that after Hymen have once join we together she shall admit of no man whatsoever to entitle he with any suspicious name of friend or servant do you mark i 

well proceed 

next if any of her old acquaintance come to visit she as nurse midwife and the like creature of secrecy she shall return they word she be not within or otherwise accommodate 

very good 

I will have it write so upon the door 

you may perceive by her silence she will consent to any thing 

then to avoid all occasion of write epistle she shall receive none nor have any paper pen ink or wax in her closet 

that be somewhat hard 

she shall not have any masculine bawdy picture hang in her chamber but shall take it down and sell it away as a thing unprofitable and a enticement of fantasy 

that in my conceit be very reasonable 

she shall bid no man to dinner but I will invite they and when they be set she shall not cast amorous glance upon they nor drink to they nor lick her lip at they nor show her tooth when she laugh nor her tongue when she sneeze 

for all these I will engage myself 

beside she shall not take upon she to contrary i in any thing nor seem more or less wise than myself 

that be not much amiss neither 

she shall send no hierogliphic nor meat cut in character nor tread upon any man foot under the table nor when they be rise give they her hand to kiss or open her palm to have her fortune tell she nor yet show they her ring or receive any of they and read the poesy 

be this all 

she shall know no language but her own nor speak any equivocate word 

in my mind now these law be very consonant to a good disposition and if I be to marry myself I will propose the like 

and for her religion she may pray to any innocent goddess as Diana and the grace but if she have any thing to say to Mars Mercury or Apollo she shall acquaint i with it and I will present her devotion 

have you do now 

last of all when she be ready to go to bed she shall not put out the candle to walk up and down in her smock and shake her body in the dark and if she be content I take she as my own 

all these she shall subscribe to if she be my daughter 

why then we will proceed to the church 

be you agree or no 

pray let i speak one word with he in private 

yes what you please sweet lady it be grant be it a hundred pound to buy pin and petticoat 

it be not a thing sir of that dear expense 
though you be please to tax i for that crime 
it be only this time be I can not love you

and clear my eye that I can see my good 
then I confess I make a solemn oath 
none shall enjoy my love but he that dare 
attempt to steal i this be not intend 
for any peril to you but for safeguard 
of my first vow which I must needs perform

none but yourself and fetch i I will yield 
to go with you whither you shall command

Come I will do it I will send thou with a letter 
unto my mistress that shall make her mad

I shall gain my desire

the satisfy of a lewd desire 
so much to rob your mistress of her sense

or tax she of dishonesty or will you 
prove false to she what mischief do you intend 
what hope can you conceive that may secure 
so great a sin from heaven just punishment 
have you a drug or incantation 
and think to make her senseless of her grief 
with the privation of her understanding

if you do you must employ 
some other messenger let i advise you 
keep she in her right mind while you have she 
love of itself be a illusive spirit 
and will enough distract she without help

Come master Littlegood be comfort 
I have as great a share in the misfortune 
of your distract daughter as yourself

you have reason 
to pity i the more and lament for she 
because I destine she in marriage to you 

and I have well hope to have be make happy 
in her affection a true lover grief 
transcend a parent 

no you be deceive 
a parent be confine and his joy bound 
and only limit to such a subject 
and drive from thence have nowhere else to rest on 
for if his child be once take from he 
which be the cause than his delight and comfort 
that be the effect needs must vanish with they 
but in a lover it fall otherwise 
such as yourself who passion like a dew 
can dry up with the beam of every beauty 
that shall shine warm upon you need not prize 
the loss of any you have no alliance 
nor natural tie command you to love any 
more than your fancy guide you and the wind 
have not so many turn nor the sand 
so many shift nor the moon change 

sir you speak truth upon my knowledge that 
he be as slippery as a eel in love 
and wriggle in and out sir at his pleasure 
he can as easy dispense with vow 
as swear they and can at a minute warning 
if a occasion serve supply himself 
with a continual and fresh entertainment 
of a new mistress 

troth I must confess 
I have be a little faulty that way 

and why will you sir know this before 
suffer your daughter to be abuse by he 
now by my life I think and it be not for i 
you will wind yourself into such labyrinth 
you will not know how to extricate yourself 

peace good wife since there be no remedy 

do not despair there be yet remedy 
I know a scholar a great naturalist 
who wisdom do transcend all other artist 
a traveller beside and though his body 
be distant from the heaven yet his mind 
have pierce unto the utmost of the orb 
can tell how first the chaos be distinguish 
and how the sphere be turn and all their secret 
the motion and influence of the star 
the mixture of the element and all 
the cause of the wind and what move the earth 
and then he have subject to his knowledge 
the virtue and the working of all herb 
and be a Aesculapius in physic 
no grief above his art 

can he heal mad folk 

be they as mad as Ajax Telamonius 
that slay a ox in stead of Agamemnon 
he will warrant they 

how shall one speak with he 

I bring he with i he be at the door 
prithee go call he Fido you shall hear he 
and as you like his speech so credit he 

be this the man 

this be the doctor sir 
I be bold to make relation of your skill here 
to this old gentleman who have a daughter 
that be suspect to be mad 

suspect be she not otherwise 

she be stark mad 

it come by love 

yes sure what think you on it 

a ordinary disease and cure in some thing 
I be of a opinion that Stertinius 
the stoic be who hold all the world mad 

as how good master doctor 

thus I prove it 
what be ambition and covetousness 
or luxury or superstition 
but madness in man and these reign general 
your lawyer trot and write as he be mad 
his client be mad than he your merchant that marry 
a fair wife and leave she at home be mad 
your courtier be mad to take up silk and velvet 
on ticket for his mistress and your citizen 
be mad to trust he 

nay he be a rare man 
and have do many and strange cure sir 

I have indeed 

pray relate some of they 

to satisfy your ladyship I will 

yes good sir let we hear they 

then I will tell you there be once a astrologer bring mad before i the circulation of the heaven have turn his brain round he have very strange fit he will ever be stare and gaze and yet his eye be so weak they can not look up without a staff 

a jacob staff you mean 

ay and he will watch whole night there can not a star stir for he he think there be no hurt do but they do it and that make he look so narrow to they 

how do you heal he sir 

only with two or three sentence out of picus mirandula in confutation of the act and as many out of Cornelius Agrippa for the vanity of it 

that be excellent 

the next be a soldier and he be very furious but I quiet he by get his arrearage pay and a pension for his life 

you take a hard task in hand mr doctor 

but the most dangerous of all be a Puritan chandler and he run mad with illumination he be very strange possess and talk idle as if he have have a noise of bell in his head he think a man in a surplice to be the ghost of heresy and be out of love with his own member because they be call organ 

o monstrous 

I and hold very strange position for he count father to be as unlawful in the church as Plato do poet in his commonwealth and thereupon ground his conclusion for the lawfulness of whoredom for he say that marriage as it be now use be the only ringleader of all mischief 

how do you heal he sir 

why lady with certain pill of sound doctrine and they purge his ill humour 

that be very speedy 

then there be a musician that run mad with crotchet the fit be so violent upon he that he will nothing but sound perpetual 

how do you with he sir 

I serve he as Hercules serve his master Linus break his fiddle about his pate and send he away without ere a penny and that bring his head in tune 

I will remember this i'faith 

then there be a huntsman that be very wood he will nothing but hoop and hollow and be wonderful in love with a echo 

how do you reclaim he 

why I serve he in his own kind he have a very handsome wench to his wife and while he be play the Shafalus abroad and court his Aura I turn he into a Actaeon at home set a fair pair of horn on his head and make he a tame beast 

husband that be excellent be it not 

I cure a poet too and indeed they be a generation that be little better than mad at all time I be fain to give he over because himself and other take such delight in his fury I can not tell what to make of he his disease be so pretty and conceit and he be no soon well but he will present fall into a relapse I can make relation of a thousand such as painter alchemist and the like but it will be tedious 

nay sir we be confirm of your skill will you have my daughter bring forth to you sir that you may see she in her fit 

no by no mean it will spend her spirit too much I will take she home with i and anoint her brow with a little helleborum and some other receipt that I will give she and I will warrant you I will bring her safe too in three hour and well recover 

sir you will do a office that will not more deserve honour then reward
