So will you leave your dream and dispatch

my lord I fancy not these hunt sport 
when the bold game you follow turn again 
and stare you in the face let i behold 
a cast of falcon on their merry wing 
dare the stoop prey that shift fly 
or let i view the fearful hare or hind 
to●t like a music point with harmony 
of well mouth hound this be a sport for prince 
the other rude boar yield fit game for boor 

thy timorous spirit blind thy judgement wife 
those be most royal sport that most approve 
the huntsman prowess and his hardy mind 

my lord I know too well your virtuous spirit 
take heed for god love if you rouse the boar 
you come not near he but discharge aloof 
your wound pistol or well aim dart 

I marry wife this counsel right flow 
out of thy bosom pray thou take less care 
let lady at their table judge of boar 
lord in the field and so farewell sweet love 
fail not to meet i at earl lasso house 

pray pardon i for that you know I love not these solemn meeting 

you must needs for once 
constrain your disposition and indeed 
I will acquaint you more with lady Margaret 
for special reason 

very good my lord then I must needs go fit i for that presence 

I pray thou do farewell 
here come my friend 
good day my lord why do your grace confront 
so clear a morning with so cloudy look 

ask thou my grief that know my desperate love 
curb by my father stern reality 
must not I mourn that know not whether yet 
I shall enjoy a stepdame or a wife 

a wife prince never doubt it your desert 
and youthful grace have engage so far 
the beauteous Margaret that she be your own 

o but the eye of watchful jealousy 
rob my desire of mean enjoy her favour 

despair not there be mean enough for you 
suborn some servant of some good respect 
that be near your choice who though she need no woo 
may yet imagine you be to begin 
your strange young love suit and so speak for you 
bear your kind letter and get safe access 
all which when he shall do you need not fear 
his trusty secrecy because he dare not 
reveal escape where of himself be author 
who you may best attempt she must reveal 
for if she love you she already know 
and in a instant can resolve you that 

and so she will I doubt not will to heaven 
I have fit time even now to know her mind 
this counsel feed my heart with much sweet hope 

pursue it then it will not be hard to effect 
the duke have none for he but Medice 
that fustian lord who in his buckram face 
bewray in my conceit a map of baseness 

ay there be a parcel of unconstrued stuff 
that unknown minion raise to honour height 
without the help of virtue or of art 
or to say true nay of honest part 
oh how she shame my father he go like 
a prince footman in old fashion silk 
and most time in his hose and doublet only 
so miserable that his own few man 
do beg by virtue of his livery 
for he give none for any service do he 
or any honour any least reward 

it be pity such shall live about a prince 
I will have such a noble counterfeit nail 
upon the pillory and after whip 
for his adultery with nobility 

faith I will fain disgrace he by all mean 
as enemy to his basebred ignorance 
that be a great lord can write nor read 

for that we will follow the blind side of he 
and make it sometime subject of our mirth

in any place or place 
for though they seem to come

but page make for need 
to fill up woman place 
by virtue of their face 
and other hide grace 
a hall a hall whist still be mum 
for now with silver song they come 

hero and heroine of gallant strain 
let not these broom mote in your eye remain 
for in the moon there be one bear wither bush 
but we dear wight do bear green broom green rush 
where of these verdant herbal clepe broom 
do pierce and enter every lady room 
and to prove they high bear and no base trash 
water with which your physiognomy you wash 
be but a broom and more truth to deliver 
grim Hercules sweep a stable with a river 
the wind that sweep foul cloud out of the air 
and for you lady make the welkin fair 
be but a broom and oh dan Titan bright 
most clerkly call the scavenger of night 
what be thou but a very broom of gold 
for all this world not to be cry nor sell 
philosophy that passion sweep from thought 
be the soul broom and by all brave wit seek 
now if philosopher but broomman be 
each broomeman then be a philosopher 
and so we come grace your gracious grace 
to sweep care cobweb from your cleanly face 

thank good master broomeman 

for i Rushman then 
to make rush ruffle in a verse of ten 
a rush which now your heel do lie on here 

cry mercy sir 

be whilom use for a pungent spear 
in that odd battle never fight but twice 
as Homer sing betwixt the frog and mouse 
rush make truelove know rush make ring 
your rush maugre the beard of white spring 
and when with gentle amorous lazy limb 
each lord with his fair lady sweet swim 
on these cool rush they may with these babble 
cradle for child make child for cradle 
and lest some Momus here may now cry push 
say our pageant be not worth a rush 
bundle of rush lo we bring along 
to pick his tooth that bite they with his tongue 

see see that be lord Medice 

God i my lord

good master pedant pray forth with your show 

Lo thus far then brave duke you see 
mere entertainment now our glee 
shall march forth in morality 
and this quaint duchess here shall see 
the fault of virgin nicety 
first woo with rural courtesy 
disburden they prance on this ground 
and make your exit with your round 
well have they dance as it be meet 
both with their nimble head and foot 
now as our country girl hold off 
and rude do their lover scoff 
our nymph likewise shall only glance 
by your fair eye and look askance 
upon her female friend that woo she 
who be in plain field force to lose she 
and after they to conclude all 
the p●rlue of our Pastoral 
a female bug and eke her friend 
shall only come and sing and end 
this lady and duchess we conclude 
fair virgin must not be too rude 
for though the rural wild and ●ntike 
abuse their love as they be franuke 
yet take you in your ivory clutch 
this noble duke and be his duchess 
thus thank all for their tacete 
I void the room and cry valete 

general well and pleas perform

wherein as if by chance when other shoot 
at the wild boar do thou discharge at he 
and with a arrow cleave his canker heart

that even as in a turnspit call a Jack

about their business every different part 
concur to one commendable end 
so and in such conformance with rare grace

a little man in shred stand at the window 
and seem to put all thing in act about he 
lift and pull with a mighty stir 
yet add no force to it nor nothing do 
so though your lord be a brave gentleman 
and seem to do this business 
he do nothing

that make he show so glorious and divine 

I can tell my lord yet I shall know if any such there be 

shall know quoth you 
I warrant you know well some there be 
shall have the fortune to have such rare man 
like brave beast to their arm support their state 
when other of as high a worth and breed 
be make the wasteful food of they they feed

nothing enough for virtue and have I 
the duke my father mean all shall be spend 
to keep brave man about i but good sir

but do yourself right and be all one man 
in all your action do not think but some

and will not stand in their society 
on birth and riches but on worth and virtue 
with who there be no niceness nor respect 
of other common friendship be he poor 
or base bear so he be rich in soul 
and noble in degree of quality 
he shall be my friend soon than a king 

to a most kingly iudgement in your lordship
