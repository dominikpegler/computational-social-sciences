with a dart of fire in his hand 
ready to throw it down 
below methinks there be false knave

and few or none can be plain see 
to thrive in the world by honesty 
methinks I see one that be wondrous fat

and some that dwell in street be large and fair 
keep back shop to utter their bad ware 
what meddle I with trade Men master and maid

be judge by my wife that be never well till she run mad 
but oh the baker how he play false with the balance 
and run away from the taker talon

for it be their trick to blow up lean meat with a quill 
and with the stroke a butcher give a ox 
that loud bellow do make 
I lose sight of all the other trick 
and so sudden do wake 
but now must Ralph trudge about his prophetation 
faith you shall hear i troll it out after my fashion 

thus have I serve in my prince war 
against the persian and the asian power 
the coalblack moor that revel in the straits 
have I repel with my loss of blood 
my scar be witness of my hard escape 
my wrinkle in my face make old by care 
when yet my year be in their chief prime 
be glass of my grief light of my languor 
that live disgrace and have deserve honour 

I be the admiredst in Boeotia 
by honour i thou shall obtain preferment 

unto the god and prince do soldier honour 
and be thou one of these I will adore thou 

I be of power more than all the god 
to sit and rule the heart of all degree 
they have in i content as thou shall see 
a present instance in these enter man 

Haile to content divine excellence 

content our sweet good we do salute thou 

though last I be not least in duteous kindness 
to thou content although thou be no god 
yet great in account than all of they 

but if you know his name be Olygoros which signify contempt you will not mistake he and name he content 

o master scholar be patient for though you like not my name you love my nature and therefore gentleman forward with the discourse intend at our last meeting and in that conference this gentleman a soldier I presume will make one 

be a soldier his company be fit for any honest gentleman and therefore welcome into our company 

I thank you sir 
May say to you with some surplusage my wood they bring i home my hay and corn in harvest their cattle servant son and self be at my command 

o jure quaque iniuria 

nay and you speak latin reach i my last 
hark you master scholar hark you 
the time shall come not long before the doom 
that in despite of room 
lat in shall lack 
and Greek shall beg with a wallet at his back 
for all be not sober that go in black 
go too scholar there be a learning for your knack 

at my list can I rack their rent set they to fine bind they to forfeit force they to what I please if I build they be my labourer if bargain on they I build and for my good look they be content to endure any travel 

but for all this ill and wrong 
mark the cobbler song 
the high hill and the deep ditch 
which you dig to make yourselves rich 
the chimney so many and alm not any 
the widow woeful cry 
and babe in street that lie 
the bitter sweat and pain 
that tenant poor sustain 
will turn to your bane I tell you plain 
when burn fire shall rain 
and fill with botch and blain 
the sinew and each vain 
then these poor that cry 
be lift up on high 
when you be all forlorn 
shall laugh you loud to scorn 
then where will be the scholar allegory 
where the lawyer with his dilatory 
where the courtier with his bravery 
and the money monge mate with all his knavery 
bethink i can I nowhere else 
but in hell where dives dwell 
but I see you care not yet 
and think these word for i unfit 
and guess I speak for lack of wit 
stand aside stand aside for I be dispose to spit 

be quiet cobbler let we hear the scholar speak 

I give he retority to it 

what the courtier dream possess the country gentleman with curse and the soldier with care I quiet enjoy without control in my study I contemplate what can be do in battle and with my pen hurt more than thousand do with pike I strike he that see i not 

I think you be a proper man of your hand to come behind one 

I see the height of heaven 

but thou make no haste thither 

I view the depth of hell 

be there any room in hell for curse wife and cobbler shop 

content be my landlord peace and quiet be my companion I be not with the courtier bind to dance attendance nor with the countryman bind I other to attend on i I possess pleasure more than mortal and my contemplation be only of the life immortal 

but you will be glad to creep in credit in the court scholar and not be curious of the mean for all your coyness 

I will not acquaint you sir with my intent for they be fool that in secret affair be too familiar know this that I intend to await occasion 

faith master scholar yet it stand not with your protestation 

nor with you soldier to be thus blunt after your rude fashion 

Alas sir you must needs be excellent for Piers and plain your poor tenant pray for you their bread and cheese be seldom deny to any when your small beer be scarce common to many you know what will be make of a fat ox as well as the grazier of the tallow as well as the butcher of a tod of wool as well as the Stapler 

what have any man to do what I do with my own 

i all be thy own that come in thy hand 

sir you will make enough of it in you to 

I master courtier that be to deal as you do 

this soldier be as rough as if he be in the field 

where you will be as tame 

have a proud heart though a beggar habit 

where I frequent this habit serve my turn and as goodly a sight be it to see you there in your silk as the scholar skirmish in his long gown or the country gentleman ride on a fat ox with a mole spade on his neck 

what ride run brave brawl 
I see you pass not for a prophet call 
therefore I will not be so mad 
to cast pearl to swine so bad 

prithee Ralph stay a little

your disputation be do gentleman which have high content i what will you now do

Even as the child do wormseed hide in raisin which of itself he can brook so thou can not abide my name but love my nature for proof want live rail on the city grieve at the country yea grudge at the king himself thou say thou be go to thy patron mar with a supplication for better thy estate and how by war where how many rape wrong and murder be commit thyself be judge all which thou esteem not off so thy own want be supply 

contempt herein thou reason like thyself 
base mind man I know there be in field 
that do delight in murder rape and blood 
as there be tare in corn and weed with flower 
and envious snake among the fleet fish 
but for the noble soldier he be just 
to punish wrong protect the innocent 
weaken the tyrant and confirm the right 
want can make he base mutinous 
wealth can make he proud insolent 
in honourable thought dwell his content 
and he be foe to all that love contempt

why pope and prelate prince and judge more than I number can

for they weigh the devil and all 

Mas and may well be for there be little money stir on the earth

why what be thou that make such haste

So trouble with nun as never friar be 
therefore good Charon let i be first

boatsman 

Hagh 

there be a scoff that be a waterman indeed 
well I must to God mar for all this 
I will I can meet my soldier again 

Even as the eagle soar against the sun 
and spite of Phoebus shine pry in his face 
even as the swordfish meet the mighty whale 
and put the huge monster to disgrace 
so Emnius thought intend to aspire 
sore against the sun and fleet in wrathful ire 
the duke the sun that dazzle Emnius eye 
the duke the huge whale that overbear i 
but I will gaze and blind he too ere long 
and play the swordfish though he little fear i 
the less suspect soon shall I strike he 
and this my reason be for I mislike he 
his daughter with entice word be win my own 
but I disdain she be she fair far 
tush it be for rule I cast and princely throne 
the state of prince bright than bright star 
and who do hinder Emnius but the duke 
and therefore who shall perish but the duke 
short a solemn hunt he intend 
and who but I be put in chief trust 
well I will be trusty if my Pistol hold 
in love and kingdom jove will prove unjust 
he dead I wed his heir and only daughter 
and so shall win a crown by one man slaughter 
suppose he have be kind liberal and free 
why I confess it but it be my desire 
to be as able to bestow as he 
and till I can my heart consume in fire 
oh sovereign glory chief earthly good 
a crown to which who will not wade through blood 
then ruthless of his life do I resolve 
to wait my time till I have wrought his end 
he die the duke shall die and Emnius reign 
be he my father or a dear friend 
tear shall not hinder prayer shall not entreat i 
but in his throne by blood I soon will seat i 

be thou one of God mar his train 
alas good father thou be lame 
to be a soldier far unlusty 
thy beard be grey thy armour rusty 
thy bill I think be break too 

friend make not thou so much ado 
my lameness come by war 
my armour rustiness come by peace 
a maim soldier make mar his porter 
lo this be I now question cease 

and what be you a painter with your pencil and your colour brave 

no painter but a herald sirrah to decipher a gentleman from a knave 

pray sir can you gentleman and knave it both in one man and you can sir I pray you do it in i 

Indeed I can in thyself 
for all be knave that be in thou

and so shall we right well agree 

sir take no heed what he do say 
his foolish humour you do see 
but tell i pray be you a herald

I shall have rather take you to have be 
appelles prentice you be with colour so provide 
in ancient time have herald be esteem 
and hold companion for the great king 
Augustus Caesar make a law so do Antonius too 
that without herald grave advice prince shall nothing do 

well then be then these time be as they be 
we now be fain to wait who grow to wealth 
and come to bear some office in a town 
and we for money help they unto arm 
for what can the golden tempter do 

a lamentable thing it be but tell we I entreat 
where may we find adore Mars 

from hence sir you to Venus court must pass 
down the hill the way be steep smooth sleek as any glass 
go by the door of dalliance and if you there he miss 
ask niceness for she best can tell where her fair lady be 
both day and night the door be open 
the strong closet door be but of feather make 
rush bold in stand not to ask and never be afraid 

at Venus court sir do you say that mar be to be find 

gentleman we have tell you truth although unto our heart it be a wound 
for search as we bid you sir 
no doubt a wondrous hap 
but you shall find God mar asleep 
on lady Venus lap 
this one thing more you can come 
the way you thither pass 
it be dangerous the hill too sleep and slippery all as glass 
take this of i the fair way from Venus court be beggary 
there be more way but they be worse and threaten more extremity 

i that be for such as thither pass 
of pleasure and of will 
but these for other purpose go 
doubt therefore sir no ill 

I thank you both that have we warn by your skill 

I and I will end with a prophecy for your good will 
you think it be a pleasant jest 
to tell the time of peace and rest 
but he that live to ninety nine 
into the hundred shall decline 
then shall they speak of a strange time 
for it will be a wondrous thing 
to see a carter lodge with a king 
town shall be unpeople see 
and market make upon the green 
this will be as true I tell you all 
as cobbler use the thread and awl 
and so because that all man be but mortar 
I leave the paltry herald and the porter 

I pray thou come away gentleman with thanks I take my leave 

adieu good sir 

farewell unto you both 

Come lady love now bear we mar thou i I thy belove

against who frown nor death nor heaven can stand 
have I for this procure the angry god 
to make i exile from all blessedness

thou murderer tiger glut with my fair 
leave i forsake map of grief and care 
oh what be beauty humble to the base

ah that my woe can other woman warn 
to love true wedlock or the virgin life 
for i too late for they fit time to learn 
the honour of a maid and constant wife

but the foul horror of a harlot name 
even of the lecher count as a scorn 
who forehead bear the mark of hateful shame 
of the lustlover hate and forlorn 
o such be Venus so shall all such be 
as use base lust and foul adultery

that circle we about with wonder great 
receive the offering of our humble heart 
and body prostrate on the lowly earth 
our sin have draw the fury of thy wrath 
and turn our peace to misery and war 
but if repentant soul may purchase grace 
we crave it humble and intend to live

in which our sin be cast and there consume

and be propitious to the penitent
