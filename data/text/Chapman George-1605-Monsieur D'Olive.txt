convey your carriage to my brother in law 
the earl of saint Anne to who and to my sister 
commend my humble service tell they both 
of my arrival and intent to attend they 
when in my way I have perform fit duty 
to count Vaumont and his most honour countess 

we will sir this way follow honest sailor 

our first observance after any absence 
must be present ever to our mistress 
as at our part she shall still be last 
hinc amor ut circulus from hence it be say 
that love be like a circle be the efficient 
and end of all our action which excite 
by no worse abject than my matchless mistress 
be worthy to employ we to that likeness 
and be the only ring our power shall beat 
noble she be by birth make good by virtue 
exceed fair and her behaviour to it 
be like a singular musician 
to a sweet instrument or else as doctrine 
be to the soul that put it into act 
and print it full of admirable form 
without which it be a empty idle flame 
her eminent judgement to dispose these part 
sit on her brow and hold a silver sceptre 
with which she keep time to the several music 
place in the sacred consort of her beauty 
love complete armoury be manage in she 
to stir affection and the discipline 
to check and to affright it from attempt 
any attaint may disproportion she 
or make her grace less than circular 
yet her even carriage be as far from coyness 
as from immodesty in play in dance 
in suffer courtship in requite kindness 
in use of place hour and company 
free as the sun and nothing more corrupt 
as circumspect as Cynthia in her vow 
and constant as the centre to observe they 
ruthful and bounteous never fierce nor dull 
in all her course ever at the full 
these three year I have travail and so long 
have be in travail with her dear sight 
which now shall beautify the enamour light 
this be her house what the gate shut and clear 
of all attendant why the house be wont 
to hold the usual concourse of a court 
and see methinks through the encurtain window 
in this high time of day I see light taper 
this be exceed strange behold the farle 
walk in as strange sort before the door 
I will know this wonder sure my honour lord 

keep of sir and beware who you embrace 

why fly your lordship back 

you shall be sure 
to know a man your friend ere you embrace he 

I hope my knowledge can be more sure 
then of your lordship friendship 

no man knowledge 
can make he sure of any thing without he 
or not within his power to keep or order 

I comprehend not this and wonder much 
to see my most love lord so much estrange 

the truth be I have do your know desert 
more wrong then with your right shall let you greet i 
and in your absence which make worse the wrong 
and in your honour which still make it worse 

if this be all my lord the discontent 
you seem to entertain be mere causeless 
your free confession and the manner of it 
do liberal excuse what wrong soever 
your misconceit can make you lie on i 
and therefore good my lord discover it 
that we may take the spleen and corsey from it 

then hear a strange report and reason why 
I do you this repent injury 
you know my wife be by the right of courtship 
your choose mistress and she not dispose 
as other lady be to entertain 
peculiar term with common act of kindness 
but know in she more than woman judgement 
that she shall nothing wrong she husband right 
to use a friend only for virtue choose 
with all the right of friendship take such care 
after the solemn part to your travail 
and speak of you with such exceed passion 
that I grow jealous and with rage except 
against her kindness utter forget 
I shall have weigh so rare a woman word 
as duty of a free and friendly justice 
not as the headstrong and incontinent vapour 
of other lady blood inflame with lust 
wherein I injure both your innocency 
which I approve not out of flexible dotage 
by any cunning flattery of my wife 
but in impartial equity make apparent 
both by my own wellweighed comparison 
of all her other manifest perfection 
with this one only doubtful levity 
and likewise by her violent apprehension 
of her deep wrong and you for she have vow 
never to let the common panderess light 
or any doom as vulgar censure she 
in any action she leave subject to they 
never to fit the day with her attire 
nor grace it with her presence nourish in it 
unless with sleep nor stir out of her chamber 
and so have muffle and mew up her beauty 
in neverceasing darkness never sleep 
but in the day transform by she tonight 
with all sun banish from she smother grace 
and thus my dear and most unmatched wife 
that be a comfort and a grace to i 
in every judgement every company 
ay by false jealousy have no less than lose 
murder her live and entomb her quick 

conceit it not so deep good my lord 
your wrong to i or her be no fit ground 
to bear so weighty and resolve a vow 
from her incense and abuse virtue 

there can not be a more important cause 
to fill she with a ceaseless hate of light 
to see it grace gross lightness with full beam 
and frown on continence with her oblique glance 
as nothing equal right to virtue do 
so be her wrong past all comparison 

virtue be not malicious wrong do she 
be right ever when man grant they err 
but do my princely mistress so contemn 
the glory of her beauty and the applause 
give to the worth of her society 
to let a voluntary vow obscure they 

see all her window and her door make fast 
and in her chamber light for night inflame 
now other rise she take she to her bed 

this news be strange heaven grant I be encounter 
with better tide of my other friend 
let i be bold my lord to inquire the state 
of my dear sister in who self and i 
survive the whole hope of our family 
together with her dear and princely husband 
the earl of saint Anne 

unhappy that I be 
I will to heaven your most welcome step 
have bring you first upon some other friend 
to be the sad Relator of the change 
chance your three year most lament absence 
your worthy sister worthy far of heaven 
then this unworthy hell of passionate earth 
be take up among her fellow star 

unhappy man that ever I return 
and perish not ere these news pierce my ear 

nay be not you that teach man comfort grieve 
I know your judgement will set willing shoulder 
to the know burden of necessity 
and teach your wilful brother patience 
who strive with death and from his cave of rest 
retain his wife dead corpse among the live 
for with the rich sweet of restore balm 
he keep her look as fresh as if she live 
and in his chamber as in life attire 
she in a chair sit lean on her arm 
as if she only sleep and at her foot 
he like a mortify hermit clad 
sit weep out his life as have lose 
all his life comfort and that she be dead 
who be his great part he must consume 
as in a apoplexy strike with death 
nor can the duke nor duchess comfort he 
nor messenger with consolatory letter 
from the kind king of France who be ally 
to she and you but to lift all his thought 
up to another world where she expect he 
he feed his ear with soulexciting music 
solemn and tragical and so resolve 
in those sad accent to exhale his soul 

o what a second ruthless sea of woe 
wrack i within my haven and on the shore 
what shall I do morn mourn with they that mourn 
and make my great woe their less expel 
this day I will consecrate to sigh and tear 
and this next even which be my mistress morning 
I will greet she wonder at her wilful humour 
and with rebuke break out of my love 
and duty to her honour make she see 
how much her too much curious virtue wrong her 

say like the man the world have ever hold you 
welcome as new line to we our good now 
shall whole be ascribe and trust to you 

see see the virtuous countess have bid our day good night her star be now visible when be any lady see to be so constant in her vow and able to forbear the society of man so sincere 

never in this world at least exceed seldom what shame it be for man to see woman so far surpass they for when be any man know out of judgement to perform so stay a abstinence from the society of woman 

never in this world 

what a excellent creature a honest woman be I warrant you the countess and her virgin sister spend all their time in contemplation watch to see the sacred spectacle of the night when other lady lie drown in sleep or sensuality be it not so think 

no question 

Come come let we forget we be courtier and talk like honest man tell truth and shame all traveller and tradesman thou believe all be natural beauty that show fair though the painter enforce it and suffer in soul I know for the honourable lady 

can any heart of adamant not yield in compassion to see spotless innocence suffer such bitter penance 

a very fit stock to graft on tush man think what she be think where she live think on the villainous cunning of these time indeed do we live now in old Saturn time when woman have no other art than what nature teach be and yet there needs little art I wiss to teach a woman to dissemble when luxury be unborn at least untaught the art to steal from a forbid tree when coach when periwig and paint when mask and mask in a word when court and court be unknown a easy mist may then perhaps have wrought upon my sense as it do now on the poor countess and thou

ay ay a court term for I wot what slight Vandome the stallion of the court her devote servant and forsooth love she honourable tush he be a fool that believe it for my part I love to offend in the better part still and that be to judge charitable but now forsooth to redeem her honour she must by a laborious and violent kind of purgation rub off the skin to wash out the spot turn her chamber to a cell the sun into a taper and as if she live in another world among the antipode make our night her day and our day her night that under this curtain she may lay his jealousy asleep while she turn poor Argus to Actaeon and make his sheet common to her servant Vandome 

Vandome why he be meet in the street but even now new arrive after three year travail 

new arrive he have be arrive this twelvemonth and have ever since line close in his mistress cunning darkness at her service 

fie of the devil who will not envy slander o the miserable condition of her sex bear to live under all construction if she be courteous she be think to be wanton if she be kind she be too willing if coy too wilful if she be modest she be a clown if she be honest she be a fool and so be he

a elephant and straight way like a ox 
and then a mouse or like those changeable creature 
that live in the bordello now in satin

we take the sorrow of the earl saint anne 
for his decease wife with who dead sight 
he feed his passion keep she from right 
of christian burial to make his eye 
do penance by their everlasting tear 
for lose the dear sight of her quick beauty 

Well speak yfaith your grace must give i leave 
to praise your wit for faith it be rare speak 

the better for your good commendation 
but sir your embassy to the french king 
shall be to this effect thus you shall say 

not so your excellence shall pardon i 
I will not have my tale put in my mouth 
if you will deliver i your mind in gross 
why so I shall express it as I can 
I warrant you it will be sufficient 

it be very good than sir my will in gross 
be that in pity of the sad countess case 
the king will ask the body of his niece 
to give it funeral fit her high blood 
which as yourself require and reason will 
I leave to be enforce and amplify 
with all the ornament of art and nature 
which flow I see in your sharp intellect 

alas you can see it in this short time 
burr there be some not far hence that have see 
and hear i too ere now I can have wish 
your highness presence in a private conventicle 
at what time the high point of state be handle 

what be the point 

it be my hap to make a number there 
myself as every other gentleman 
be interest in that grave affair 
where I deliver my opinion how well 

what be the matter pray 
the matter sir 
be of a ancient subject and yet new 
call into question and it be this in brief 
we sit as I remember all in row 
all sort of man together 
a squire and a carpenter a lawyer and a sawyer 
a merchant and a broker a justice and a peasant 
and so forth without all difference 

but what be the matter 

faith a stale argument though new handle 
and I be fearful I shall shame myself 
the subject be so thread bare 

it be no matter be as it will go to you point I pray 

then thus it be the question of estate 
or the state of the question be in brief 
whether in a aristocracy 
or in a democratical estate 
tobacco may be bring to lawful use 
but have you hear the excellent speech there 
touch this part 

pray thou to the point 

first to the point then 
upstart a weaver blow up by inspiration 
that have bear office in the congregation 
a little fellow and yet great in spirit 
I never shall forget he for he be 
a most hot livered enemy to tobacco 
his face be like the ten of diamond 
point each where with push and his nose 
be like the ace of club which I must tell you 
be it that set he and tobacco first at such hot enmity for that nose of he accord to the puritanic cut have a narrow bridge and this tobacco be in drink dare not pass by and find stop his narrow passage flee back as it come and go away in Pett 

just cause of quarrel 

but pray thou brief say what say the weaver 

the weaver sir much like a virginal iack 
start nimble up the colour of his beard 
I scarce remember but purblind he be 
with the Geneva print and wear one ear 
short than tother for a difference 

a man of very open note it seem 

he be so sir and hot he inveigh 
against tobacco with a most strong breath 
for he have eat garlic the same morning 
as it be his use partly against ill air 
partly to make his speech savoury 
say it be a pagan plant a profane weed 
and a most sinful smoke that have no warrant 
out of the word invent sure by Satan 
in these our latter day to cast a mist 
before man eye that they may not behold 
the grossness of old superstition 
which be as it be derive into the church 
from the foul sink of romish popery 
and that it be a judgement on our land 
that the substantial commodity 
and mighty blessing of this realm of France 
bell rattle hobby horse and such like 
which have bring so much wealth into the land 
shall now be change into the smoke of vanity 
the smoke of superstition for his own part 
he hold a garlic clove be sanctify 
do edify more the body of a man 
then a whole tin of this profane tobacco 
be take without thanksgiving in a word 
he say it be a rag of popery 
and none that be true regenerate will 
profane his nostril with the smoke thereof 
and speak of your grace behind your back 
he charge and conjure you to see the use 
of vain tobacco banish from the land 
for fear lest for the great abuse thereof 
or candle be put out and there with all 
take his handkerchief to wipe his mouth 
as he have tell a lie he tune his noise 
to the old strain as if he be prepare 
for a new exercise but I myself 
angry to hear this generous tobacco 
the gentleman saint and the soldier idol 
so ignorant pollute stand i up 
take some tobacco for a compliment 
break phlegm some twice or thrice then shake my ear 
and lick my lip as if I beg attention 
and so direct i to your sweet grace 
thus I reply 

Mug Rome for a speech there silence 

I be amuse or I be in a quandary gentleman for in good faith I remember not well whether of they be my word 

it be no matter either of they will serve the turn 

whether I shall as the poet say eloquar a siliam whether by answer a fool I shall myself seem no less or by give way to his wind for word be but wind I may betray the cause to the maintenance whereof all true trojan from who race we claim our decent owe all their patrimony and if need be their dear blood and their sweet breath I will not be tedious to your highness 

you be not sir proceed 

tobacco that excellent plant the use whereof as of five element the world can want be that little shop of nature wherein her whole workmanship be abridge where you may see earthkindled into fire the fire breath out a exhalation which enter in at the mouth walk through the region of a man brain drive out all ill vapour but itself down all bad humour by the mouth which in time may breed a scab over the whole body if already they have not a plant of singular use for on the one side nature be a enemy to vacuity and emptiness and on the other there be so many empty brain in the world as there be how shall nature course be continue how shall these empty brain be fill but with air nature immediate instrument to that purpose if with air what so proper as your fume what fume so healthful as your perfume what perfume so sovereign as tobacco beside the excellent edge it give a man wit as they can best judge that have be present at a feast of tobacco where common all good wit be consort what variety of discourse it beget what spark of wit it yield it be a world to hear as likewise to the courage of a man for if it be true that johannes de savo et savo et write that he that drink verjuice piss vinegar than it must needs follow to be as true that ho that eat smoke fart fire for garlic I will not say because it be a plant of our own country but it may cure the disease of the country but for the disease of the court they be out of the element of garlic to medicine to conclude as there be no enemy to tobacco but garlic so there be no friend to garlic but a sheep head and so I conclude 

well sir if this be but your natural vain 
I must confess I know you not indeed 
when I make offer to instruct your brain 
for the ambassage and will trust you now 
if it be to send you forth to the great Turk 
with a ambassage 

but sir in conclusion 
it be order for my speech that since tobacco 
have so long be in use it shall thence forth 
be bring to lawful use but limit thus 
that none shall dare to take it but a gentleman 
or he that have some gentlemanly humour 
the murr the headache the catarrh the bone ache 
or other branch of the sharp salt rheum 
fit a gentleman 

your grace have make choice 
of a most simple lo ambassador

to make the world take notice I be noble 
the first thing I will do I will swear to pay

a good cheap proof of your nobility 

but if I know where I may pawn my honour 
for some odd thousand crown it shall be lay 
I will pay it again when I have do withal 
then it will be expect I shall be of some religion 
I must think of some for fashion or for faction sake 
as it become great personage to do 
I will think upon it betwixt this and the day 

Well say my lord this lordship of you will work a mighty alteration in you do you not feel it begin to work already 

Fayth only in this it make i think how they that be my companion before shall now be my favorite they that be my friend before shall now be my follower they that be my servant before shall now be my knave but they that be my creditor before shall remain my creditor still 

excellent lord come will you show your lordship in the presence now 

faith I do not care if I go and make a face or two there or a few graceful leg speak a little italian and away there be all a presence do require 

you have incline i more to leave this life 
than I suppose it possible for a angel 
nor be your judgement to suppress your passion 
for so dear love a sister be as well 
your blood and flesh as i the least enforcement 
of your dissuasive argument and beside 
your true resemblance of she much supply 
her want in my affection with all which 
I feel in these deep grief to which I yield 
a kind of false sluggish and rot sweetness 
mix with a humour where all thing in life 
lie drown in sour wretched and horrid thought 
the way to cowardly desperation open 
and whatsoever urge soul accurse 
to their destruction and sometime their plague 
so violent gripe i that I lie 
whole day and night bind at his tyrannous foot 
so that my day be not like life or light 
but bitter death and a continual night 

the ground of all be unsufficed love 
which will be best case with some other object 
the general rule of Naso be authentic 
for the affection of the mind draw forth 
in many current be not so impulsive 
in any one and so the persian king 
make the great river Ganges run distinct 
in a innumerable sort of channel 
by which mean of a fierce and dangerous flood 
he turn it into many please river 
so likewise be a army disarray 
make penetrable for the assault foe 
so huge fierce be diffuse grow assuage 
last as all force be unite increase 
so be disperse it grow less sharp and cease 

alas I know I can love another 
my heart accustom to love only she 
my eye accustom to view only she 
will tell i whatsoever be not her be foul and hateful 

yet forbear to keep she 
still in your sight force not her breathless body 
thus against nature to survive be dead 
let it consume that it may reassume 
a form incorruptible and refrain 
the place where you use to joy in she 
for how can you be ever sound or safe 
where in so many red step of your wound 
gasp in your eye with change of place be sure 
like sick man mend you shall find recure 

faith madam my company may well be spare at so mournful a visitation for by my soul to see Pygmalion dote upon a marble picture a senseless statue I shall laugh and spoil the tragedy 

o it be a object full of pity my lord 

it be pity in deed that any man shall love a woman so constant 

bitter turn my lord we must still admire you 

tush my lord true manhood can neither mourn nor admire it be fit for woman they can weep at pleasure even to admiration 

but man use to admire rare thing my lord 

but this be nothing rare it be a virtue common for man to love their wife after death the value of a good wife as all good thing else be better know by their want then by their fruition for no man love his wife so well while she line but he love her ten time better when she be dead 

this be sound philosophy my lord 

faith my lord I speak my thought and for my own part I shall so ill endure the loss of a wife always provide I love she that if I lose she this week I will have another by the begin of the next and thus resolve I leave your highness to deal with Atropos for cut my lady thread I be for France all my care be for follower to imp out my train I fear I must come to your grace for a press for I will be follow as become a honourable lord and that be like a honest squire for with our great lord follower abroad and hospitality at home be out of date the world be now grow thrifty he that fill a whole page in folio with his style think it very noble to be man with one bare page and a pander and yet Pandar in ancient time be the name of a honest courtier what it be now viderit utilitas come wit let we to my chamber

her resolve judgement from virginity 
unless you speak for he who word of all dame 
be hold most sweet and worthy to persuade they 

the world will think i too fantastical 
to open so sudden my vow obscureness 

my lord my love be sudden and require 
a sudden remedy if I be delay

by weigh how strong love work in yourself
