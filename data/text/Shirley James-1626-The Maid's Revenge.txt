the noble courtesy I have receive 
at Lisbon worthy friend so much engage I 
that I must die indebt to your worth 
unless you mean to accept what I have study 
although but partly to discharge the sum 
due to your honour love 

how now Sebastiano will you forfeit 
the name of friend than I do hope our love 
have outgrow compliment 

I speak my thought 
my tongue and heart be relative I think 
I have deserve no base opinion from you 
I wish not only to perpetuate 
our friendship but to exchange that common name 
of friend for 

what take heed do not profane 
will thou be more than friend it be a name 
virtue can only answer to can thou 
unite into one all goodness whatsoever 
mortality can boast of thou shall find 
the circle narrow bound to contain 
this swell treasure every good admit 
degree but this be so good it can 
for he be no friend be not superlative 
indulgent parent brethren kindred tie 
by the natural flow of blood alliance 
and what you can imagine be to light 
to weigh with name of friend they execute 
at best but what a nature prompt they to 
be often less than friend when they remain 
our kinsman still but friend be never lose 

nay then Antonio you mistake I mean not 
to leave of friend which with another title 
will not be lose come they I will tell you sir 
I will be friend and brother thus our friendship 
shall like a diamond set in gold not lose 
his sparkle but show fair I have a pair 
of sister which I will commend but that 
I may seem partial their birth and fortune 
deserve noble love if thou be free 
from other fair engagement I will be proud 
to speak they worthy come shall go and see they 
I will not beg they suitor fame have spread 
through Portugal their person and draw to Avero 
many affectionate gallant 

Catalina and Berinthia

report speak loud their beauty and no less 
virtue in either well I see you strive 
to leave no merit where you mean to honour 
I cannot otherwise escape the censure 
of one ingrateful but by wait on you 
home to Avero 

you shall honour i 
and glad my noble father to who you be 
no stranger your own worth before have be 
sufficient preparation 

ha 
I have not so much choice Sebastiano 
but if one sister of Antonio 
may have a commendation to your thought 
I will not spend much art in praise she 
her virtue speak itself I shall be happy 
and be confirm you brother though I miss 
acceptance at Avero 

still you out do i I can never wish 
my service better place at opportunity 
I will visit you at Eluas in the mean time 
let we haste to Avero where with you I will bring 
my double welcome and not fail to second 
any design

against we meet at Eluas castle sit

give your observance then I know their business 
Catalina and Berinthia be the star 
direct they hither Gaspar house shall give 
respect to all but they be two such jewel 
I must dispose mature I shall else 
return ingratitude upon the heaven 
for leave i such pledge not be I 
like other father carry with the stream 
of love tooth young as they be in birth 
they have my tenderness Catalina then 
be elder in my care Berinthia 
her child part too both fair and virtuous 
but daughter be hold loss to a family 
son only to maintain honour and stem 
alive in their posterity and I now think on it 
my son Sebastiano have be slow 
in his return from Lisbon o that boy 
renew my age with hope and have return 
my care in education weight for weight 
with noble quality will belove by the best 
oh the don in Spain and Portugal who love 
do often threaten his absence to such length 
as this have be 
but here be my elder daughter 
with her amorous count I will not be see 

you have be absent long my noble count 
beshrew i but I dream on you last night 

ha ha do you so I tickle she in her sleep I perceive 
sweet lady I do but like the valiant beast 
give a little ground to return with a great 
force of love now by my father sword 
and gauntlet thou be a precious piece of virtue 
but prithee what do dream of i last night 

nay it be a idle dream not worth the repartition 

thou dream I warrant thou that I be fight 
for thou up to the knee in blood why I dare do it 
such dream be common with count de monte 
Nigro my sleep be nothing else but rehearsal of 
battle and wound and ambuscado Donzell Delphebo 
be a mountebank of valour rosiclere a puff 
my dream deserve to be in the chronicle 

why now my dream be out

I dream that you be fight 

So 

and that in single combat for my sake 
you slay a giant and you no soon have 
rescue my honour but there creep a pigmy 
out of the earth and kill you 

very likely the valiant man must die 

what by a pigmy 

ay that be another giant I remember Hercules

Catalina I well will I be so happy once to 
maintain some honourable duel for thy sake I shall 
never be well till I have kill somebody fight it be true 
I have never yet flesh myself in blood nobody 
will quarrel with i but I find my spirit prompt 
if occasion will but wink at i why not wherefore have 
nature give i these brawny arm this manly bulk 
and these Colossian supporter nothing but to sling 
the sledge or pitch the bare and play with 
Axletree if thou love i do but command i 
some worthy service pox a danger I weigh they no 
more than fleabite will somebody do hate that 
face now I wish it with all my heart 

will you have anybody hate i 

yes I will hate they I will but thrust my hand into their 
mouth down to the bottom of their belly pluck 
out their lung and shake their inside outward 

noble sir you need not heap more protestation 
I do believe you love i 

do you believe I love and not accept it 

yes I accept it too but apprehend i 
as man do gift who acceptation do not 
bind to perform what every giver crave 
without a stain to virgin modesty 
I can accept your love but pardon i 
it be beyond my power to grant your suit 

o you too much subject a natural gift 
and make yourself behold for your own 
the sun have not more right to his own beam 
with which he gild the day nor the sea lord 
of his own wave 

alas what be it to own a passion 
without power to direct it for I move 
not by a motion I can call my own 
but by a high rapture in obedience 
to a father and I have yet no freedom 
to place affection so you but endear i 
without a merit 

here my sister 

and don Valasco how now be thy arrow feather 

well enough for rove 

rove I think to 

but I hope fair 

shoot home then Valasco I have 
present my miseris with a paper of verse see she 
be read of they 

did make they thyself 

my money do what a idle question be that as though we 
that be great man be not furnish with stipendiary 
muse be sure for my own part I can buy they 
cheaper than I can make they a great deal will 
you have learning have no reward she laugh 
at them ay be glad of that 

they favor of a true poetic fury 

do you smell nothing something have some savour 

but this line my think have more more foot than the rest 

it shall run the better for that lady I do it a purpose 

but here be another lame 

that be my conceit my own invention lame 
halt verse there be the great art beside I 
thereby give you to understand that I be valiant 
dare cut of leg and arm at all time and make they 
go halt home that be my enemy I be 
a ‚óèambographier now it be out 

for honour sake what be that 

one of the sour versifier that ever creep out of 
Parnassus when I set on it I can make anybody hang himself 
with pure iambic I can fetch blood with Asclepiad 
sting with Phalencium whip with sapphic Bastinado with hexameter and pentameter and 
yet I have a trimeter leave for thou my donna Catalina 

conclude a peace sir with your passion 
I be sorry love have be unkind to you 
to point at i who till the first have knit 
the sacred knot of marriage be forbid 
to think of love

bid i still love you pardon fair Berinthia 
Valasco have not power to rule himself 
be you less fair or virtuous perhaps 
I may abate my service

I envy that your fame shall visit i 
so oft without your person Sebastiano 
have be long happy in your noble friendship 
and can but improve himself in virtue 
that live so near your love 

don Antonio de Riviero 

the same 

with who noble worth 
you oft have fill discourse think yourself happy 
in his choice friendship if his body carry 
so many grace it be heaven within 
where his soul be 

Sebastiano thou have large recompense 
thy tedious absence you shall dishonour i 
unless you think yourself as welcome here 
as at your Eluas castle Vilarezo 
be once as you be sprightly and though I say it 
maintain my father reputation 
and honour of our house with action 
worthy our name and family but now 
time have let fall cold snow upon my hair 
plough on my brow the furrow of his anger 
disfurnish i of active blood and wrap i 
half in my sere cloth yet I have mind 
that bid i honour virtue where I see it 
bud forth and spring so hopeful 

you speak all nobleness and encourage i 
to spend the greenness of my rise year 
so to the advantage that at last I may 
be old like you 

daughter speak his welcome Catalina 

sir you be most welcome 

how be that she say he be most welcome he be 
not best love she she never make i such a reverence 
for all the kiss I have bestow upon she since 
I first open my affection I do not like this 
fellow I must be fair to use doctor Sharkin cunning 

it be not true noble to affront he 
my blood boil in i it shall I cool again 
the place be venerable by her presence 
and I may be deceive Valasco then 
keep distance with thy fear 

how now Antonio where have thou lose thyself 
strike dead with lady eye I can stargaze 
for ever thus o pardon love against who 
I often have profane and mock thy fire 
thy flame now punish i let i collect 
they be both excellent creature there be 
a majesty in Catalina eye and every part carry ambition 
or queen upon it yet Berinthia 
have something more than all this praise though she 
command the world this have more power over i 
here I have lose my freedom not the queen 
of love can thus have wound poor Antonio 
I will speak to she lady I be a novice yet in love 

it may be so 

she jest at i yet I shall be proud to be 
your servant 

I entertain no servant that be proud 

Divine Berinthia

I seem to court she and in presence too 
of some that have engage themselves perhaps 
to she already 

Come let we in my house spread to receive you 
which you may call your own I will lead the way 

please you walk sir 

it will become i thus to wait on you 

do not the fool ride we both

that fool both we we be but horse and may 
walk one another for aught I see before the door when he 
be alight and enter I do not relish that same 
novice he be not best gull i hark you don 
Valasco what shall we do 

do why 

This Antonio be a suitor to one of they 

I fear he not 

I do not fear he neither I dare fight with he and 
he be ten Antonio but the lady Don the lady 

Berinthia to who 
I pay my love devotion in my ear 
seem not to welcome he your lady do 

ay but for all that he have most mind to your mistress 
and I do not see but if he pursue it 
there be a possibility to scale the fort lady 
mind may alter by your favour I have less 
cause to fear of the two if he love not Catalina 
my game be free and I may have a course in 
her park the more easy 

it be true he prefer service to Berinthia 
and what be she then to resist the vow 
Antonio if he love dare heap upon she 
he be gracious with her father and a friend 
dear as his bosom to Sebastiano 
and may be be direct by that brother 
to aim at she or if he make free choice 
Berinthia beauty will draw up his soul 

and yet now I think on it he be very saucy 
with my love to support her arm which she 
accept too familiar and she shall 
but love he it be as bad for i for though he care 
not for she I be sure she will never abide i after it 
by this hilt I must kill he there be no remedy 
I can help it 

I will know my destiny 

and I my fate but here he come 

the strange resolution of a father 
I ever hear I be covetous 
to acquaint he with my wish pray his leave 
I may be servant to Berinthia 
but thus he brief answer until 
his elder daughter be dispose in marriage 
his young must not love and therefore wish i 
unless I can place Catalina here 
leave off solicit yet I be welcome

from who fair eye love throw a thousand flame 
into Antonio heart her cheek betray 
as many amorous blush which break out 
like a force lightning from a trouble cloud

I be sure it do not grow there I suppose 
Diego the servant of Antonio 
who colourable pretend affection 
to Ansilva bring it he be the agent for he 
now the design appear day be not more conspicuous 
than this cunning 

I be resolve 

for what

and never wake to honour o my fate 
he take the freehold of my soul away 
Berinthia and it be but one creature 
I have be a tame fool all this while 
swallow my poison in a fruitless hope 
but my revenge as heavy as jove wrath 
wrap in a thunderbolt be fall on he 

now you appear all nobleness but collect 
draw up your passion to a narrow point 
of vengeance like a burn glass that fire 
sure in the small beam he that will kill 
spend not his idle fury to make wound 
far from the heart of he he fight withal 
look where you most can danger let his head 
bleed out his brain or eye aim at that part 
be dear to he this once put to hazard 
the rest will bleed to death 

Apply this madam 

the time invite to action I will be brief 
strike he through Berinthia 

ha 

mistake i not I be her sister 
she be his heart make she your own you have 
a double victory thus you may kill he 
with most revenge and give your own desire 
a most confirm possession fight with he 
can be no conquest to you if you mean 
to strike he dead pursue Berinthia 
and kill he with the wound he make at you 
it will appear but justice all this be 
within your fathom sir 

it be some divinity hang on your tongue 

if you consent Berinthia shall not see 
more sun till you enjoy she 

how dear madam 

thus you shall steal she away 

o when

which shall to open for you to know her chamber 
a candle shall direct you in the window 
Ansilva shall attend too and provide 
to give you entrance thence take Berinthia 
and soon convey she to what place you think 
secure and most convenient in small time 
you may procure your own condition
