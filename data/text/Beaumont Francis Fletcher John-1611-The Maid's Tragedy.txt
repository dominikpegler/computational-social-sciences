what I shall utter for the oracle

then sleep one night with thou this be not feign 
nor sound it like the kiss of a bride 

be flesh so earthly to endure all this 
be these the joy of marriage Hymen keep 
this story that will make succeed youth 
neglect thy ceremony from all ear 
let it not rise up for thy shame and i 
to after age we will scorn thy law 
if thou not better bless they touch the heart 
of she who thou have send i or the world 
shall know this not a altar then will smoke 
in praise of thou we will adopt we son 
than virtue shall inherit and not blood 
if we do lust we will take the next we meet 
serve ourselves as other creature do 
and never take note of the female more 
nor of her issue I do rage in vain 
she can jest o pardon i my love 
so dear the thought be which I hold of thou 
that I must break forth satisfy my fear 
it be a pain beyond the pain of death 
to be in doubt confirm it with a oath 
if this be true 

do you invent the form 
let there be in it all the bind word 
devil and conjurer can put together 
and I will take it I have swear before 
and here by all thing holy do again 
never to be acquaint with thy bed 
be your doubt over now 

I know too much will I have doubt still 
be ever such a marriage night as this 
you power above if you do ever mean 
man shall be use thus you have think a way 
how he may bear himself and save his honour 
instant i with it for to my dull eye 
there be no mean no moderate course to run 
I must live scorn or be a murderer 
be there a three why be this night so calm 
why do not heaven speak in thunder to we 
and drown their voice 

this rage will do no good 

Euadne hear i thou have take a oath 
but such a rash one that to keep it be 
worse than to swear it call it back to thou 
such vow as that never ascend the heaven 
a tear or two will wash it quite away 
have mercy on my youth my hopeful youth 
if thou be pitiful for without boast 
this land be proud of i what lady be there 
that man call fair and virtuous in this isle 
that will have shun my love it be in thou 
to make i hold this worth o we vain man 
that trust all our reputation 
to rest upon the weak and yield hand 
of feeble woman but thou be not stone 
thy flesh be soft and in thy eye do dwell 
the spirit of love thy heart can be hard 
come lead i from the bottom of despair 
to all the joy thou have I know thou will 
and make i careful lest the sudden change 
overcome my spirit 

when I call back this oath the pain of hell environ i 

I sleep and be too temperate come to bed 
or by those hair which if thou have a soul like to thy lock 
be thread for king to wear 
about their arm 

why so perhaps they be 

I will drag thou to my bed and make thy tongue 
undo this wicked oath or on thy flesh 
I will print a thousand wound to let out life 

I fear thou not do what thou dare to i 
every ill sound word or threaten look 
thou show to i will be revenge at full 

it will not sure Euadne

hourly and do hope we shall draw out 
a long content life together here 
and die both full of grey hair in one day 
for which the thank be you but if the power 
that rule we please to call her first away 
without pride speak this world hold not a wife 
worthy to take her room aside 

I do not like this all forbear the room 
but you Amintor and your lady I have some speech that may 
concern your after live well 

he will not tell i that he lie with she if he do 
for it be apt to thrust this arm of i to act unlawful 

you will suffer i to talk with she Amintor 
and not have jealous pang 

sir I dare trust my wife 
when she dare to talk and not be jealous 

how do you like Amintor 

as I do sir 

how be that 

as one that to fulfil your pleasure 
I have give leave to call i wife and love 

I see there be no last faith in sin 
they that break word with heaven will break again 
with all the world and so do thou with i 

how sir 

this subtle woman ignorance 
will not excuse you thou have take oath 
so great that methinks they do misbecome 
a woman mouth that thou will never enjoy 
a man but i 

I never do swear so you do i wrong 

day and night have hear it 

I swear indeed that I will never love 
a man of low place but if your fortune 
shall throw you from this height I bid you trust 
I will forsake you and will bend to he 
that win your throne I love with my ambition 
not with my eye but if I ever yet 
touch any other leprosy light here 
upon my face which for your royalty 
I will not stain 

why thou dissemble and it be in i 
to punish thou 

why it be in i then not to love you which will 
more afflict your body than your punishment can i 

but thou have let Amintor lie with thou 

I have 

impudence he say himself so 

a lie 

he do not 

by this light he do strange and base and 
I will prove it so I do not only shun he for a night 
but tell he I will never close with he 

speak low it be false 

I be no man to answer with a blow 
or if I be you be the king but urge not it be most true 

do not I know the uncontrolled thought 
that youth bring with he when his blood be high 
with expectation and desire of that 
he long have wait for be not his spirit 
though he be temperate of a valiant strain 
as this our age have know what can he do 
if such a sudden speech have meet his blood 
but ruin thou for ever if he have not kill thou 
he can not bear it thus he be as we 
or any other wrong man 

this be dissemble 
Amintor thou have a ingenious look 
and shall be virtuous it amaze i 
that thou shall make such base malicious lie 

what my dear wife 

dear wife I do despise thou 
why nothing can be base than to sow 
dissension among lover 

lover who 

the king and I 

o God 

who shall live long and love without distaste 
be it not for such pickthank as thyself 
do you lie with i swear now and be punish in hell 
for this 

the faithless sin I make 
to fair Aspatia be not yet revenge 
it follow i I will not lose a word 
to this wild woman but to you my king 
the anguish of my soul thrust out this truth 
you be a tyrant and not so much to wrong 
a honest man thus as to take a pride 
in talk with he of it 

now sir see how loud this fellow lie 

you that can know to wrong shall know how 
man must right themselves what punishment be due 
from i to he that shall abuse my bed 
it be not death nor can that satisfy 
unless I show how noble I have free myself 

draw not thy sword thou know I can fear 
a subject hand but thou shall feel the weight 
of this if thou do rage 

the wait of that 
if you have any worth for heaven sake think 
I fear not sword for as you be mere man 
I dare as easy kill you for this deed 
as you dare think to do it but there be 
divinity about you that strike dead 
my rise passion as you be my king 
I fall before you and present my sword 
to cut my own flesh if it be your will 
alas I be nothing but a multitude of 
walk grief yet shall I murder you 
I may before the world take the excuse 
of madness for compare my injury 
and they will well appear too sad a weight 
for reason to endure but fall I first 
among my sorrow ere my treacherous sword 
touch holy thing but why I know not what 
I have to say why do you choose out i 
to make thus wretched there be thousand 
easy to work on and of state enough 
within the land 

I will not have a fool it be no credit for I 

worse and worse 
thou that dare talk unto thy husband thus 
profess thyself a whore and more than so 
resolve to be so still be it my fault 
to bear and bow beneath a thousand grief 
to keep that little credit with the world 
but there be wise one to you may have take another 

no for I believe thou honest as thou be valiant 

all the happiness 
bestow upon i turn into disgrace 
god take your honesty again for I 
be load with it good my lord the king 
be private in it 

thou may live Amintor 
free as thy king if thou will wink at this 
and be a mean that we may meet in secret 

a bawd hold hold my breast a bitter curse 
cease i if I forget not all respect 
that be religious on another word 
second like that and through a sea of sin 
will wade to my revenge though I shall call 
plague here and after life upon my soul 

well I be resolute you lay with she 
and so I leave you Exit king 

you must needs be prate and see what follow 

prithee vex i not 
leave i I be afraid some sudden start 
will pull a murder on i 

I be go I love my life well Exit Euadne 

I hate i as much 
this it be to break a troth I shall be glad 
if all this tide of grief will make i mad Exit 

I will know the cause of all Amintor grief 
or friendship shall be idle enter Calianax 

o Melantius my daughter will die 

trust i I be sorry will thou have take her part 

thou be a slave a cutthroat slave a bloody 

take heed old man thou will be hear to rave 
and lose thy office 

I be valiant grow 
at all these year and thou be but a slave 

some company will come and I respect 
thy year not thou so much that I can wish 
to laugh at thou alone 

I will spoil your mirth I mean to fight with thou 
there lie my cloak this be my father sword 
and he dare fight be you prepare 

why will thou dote thyself out of thy life hence get thou to bed have careful look to and eat warm thing and trouble not i my head be full of thought more weighty than thy life or death can be 

you have a name in war where you stand safe 
among a multitude but I will try 
what you dare do unto a weak old man 
in single fight you will give ground I fear 
come draw 

I will not draw unless thou pull thy death 
upon thou with a stroke there be no one blow 
that thou can give haste strength enough can kill i 
tempt i not so far then the power of earth 
shall not redeem thou 

I must let he alone 
he be stout and able and to say the truth 
however I may set a face and talk 
I be not valiant when I be a youth 
I keep my credit with a testy trick 
I have among coward but dare never fight 

I will not promise to preserve your life if you do stay 

I will give half my land that I dare fight with that proud man a little if I have man to hold he I will beat he till he ask I mercy 

sir will you begone 

I dare not stay but I will beat my servant all over for this Exit Calianax 

this old fellow haunt i 
but the distract carriage of my Amintor 
take deep on i I will find the cause 
I fear his conscience cry he wrong Aspasia 

man eye be not subtle to perceive 
my inward misery I bear my grief 
hide from the world how be thou wretched then 
for aught I know all husband be like i 
and every one I talk with of his wife 
be but a well dissembler of his woe 
as I be will I know it for the rareness 
afflict i now 

Amintor we have not enjoy our friendship of late for we be wont to charge our soul in talk 

Melantius I can tell the a good jest of Strato and a lady the last day 

how be it 

why such a odd one 

I have long to speak with you not of a idle jest that be force but of matter you be bind to utter to i 

what be that my friend 

I have observe your word fall from your tongue 
wild and all your carriage 
like one that strive to show his merry mood 
when he be ill dispose you be not wont 
to put such scorn into your speech you wear 
upon your face ridiculous jollity 
some sadness sit here which your tongue will 
cover over with smile and it will not be 
what be it 

a sadness here what cause 
can fate provide for i to make i so 
be I not love through all this isle the king 
rain greatness on i have I not receive 
a lady to my bed that in her eye 
keep mount fire and on her tender cheek 
immutable colour in her heart 
a prison for all virtue be not you 
which be above all joy my constant friend 
what sadness can I have no I be light 
and feel the course of my blood more warm 
and stir than they be faith marry too 
and you will feel so unexpressed a joy 
in chaste embrace that you will indeed 
appear another 

you may shape Amintor 
cause to cozen the whole world withal 
and yourself too and it be not like a friend 
to hide your soul from i it be not your nature 
to be thus idle I have see you stand 
as you be blast midst of all your mirth 
call thrice aloud and then start feign joy 
so cold world what do I hear a friend 
be nothing heaven I will have tell that man 
my secret sin I will search a unknown land 
and there plant friendship all be wither here 
come with a compliment I will have fight 
or tell my friend a lie ere soothe he so 
out of my bosom 

but there be nothing 

worse and worse farewell 
from this time have acquaintance but no friend 

Melantius stay you shall know what that be 

see how you plead with friendship be advise 
how you give cause unto yourself to say 
you have lose a friend 

forgive what I have do 
for I be so overgo with misery 
unheard of that I lose consideration 
of what I ought to do o o 

do not weep what be it 
may I once but know the man 
have turn my friend thus 

I have speak at first but that 

but what 

I hold it most unfit 
for you to know faith do not know it yet 

thou see my love that will keep company 
with thou in tear hide nothing then from i 
for when I know the cause of thy distemper 
with my old armour I will adorn myself 
my resolution and cut through thy foe 
unto thy quiet till I place thy heart 
as peaceable as spotless innocence 
what be it 

why it be this it be too big 
to get out let my tear make way awhile 

punish i strange heaven if he escape 
of life or fame that bring this youth to this 

your sister 

Well say 

you will wish unknown when you have hear it 

no 

be much to blame 
and to the king have give her honour up 
and live in whoredom with he 

how be this 
thou be run mad with injury indeed 
thou can not utter this else speak again 
for I forgive it free tell thy grief 

she be wanton I be loath to say a whore 
though it be true 

speak yet again before my anger grow 
up beyond throw down what be thy grief 

by all our friendship these 

what be I sane 
after my action shall the name of friend 
blot all our family and stick the brand 
of whore upon my sister unrevenged 
my shake flesh be thou a witness for i 
with what unwillingness I go to scourge 
this railer who my folly have call friend 
I will not take thou base thy sword 
hang near thy hand draw it that I may whip 
thy rashness to repentance draw thy sword 

not on thou do thy anger go as high 
as trouble water thou shall do i ease 
here and eternal if thy noble hand 
will cut i from my sorrow 

this be base 
and fearful they that use to utter lie 
provide not blow but word to qualify 
the man they wrong thou have a guilty cause 

thou please i for so much more like this 
will raise my anger up above my grief 
which be a passion easy to be know 
and I shall then be bless 

take then more to raise thy anger it be mere 
cowardice make thou not draw and I will leave thou dead 
however but if thou be so much press 
with guilt and fear as not to dare to fight 
I will make thy memory loathe and fix a farewell 
upon thy name for ever 

then I draw 
as just as our magistrate their sword 
to cut offender off I know before 
it will grate your ear but it be base in you 
to urge a weighty secret from your friend 
and then rage at it I shall be at ease 
if I be kill and if you fall by i 
I shall not long out live you 

stay a while 
the name of friend be more than family 
or all the world beside I be a fool 
thou search humane nature that do make 
to do i wrong thou be inquisitive 
and thrust i upon question that will take 
my sleep away will I have die ere know 
this sad dishonour pardon i my friend 
if thou will strike here be a faithful heart 
pierce it for I will never heave my hand 
to thou behold the power thou have in i 
I do believe my sister be a whore 
a leprous one put up thy sword young man 

how shall I bear it then she be so 
I fear my friend that you will lose i short 
and I shall do a foul act on myself 
through these disgrace 

better half the land 
be bury quick together no Amintor 
thou shall have ease of this adulterous king 
that draw she to it where get he the spirit 
to wrong i so 

what be it then to i 
if it be wrong to you 

why not so much the credit of our house 
be throw away 
but from his iron den I will waken death 
and hurl he on this king my honesty 
shall steel my sword and on my horrid point 
I will wear my cause that shall amaze the eye 
of this proud man and be to glitter 
for he to look on 

I have quite undo my fame 

Dry up thy watery eye 
and cast a manly look upon my face 
for nothing be so wild as I thy friend 
till I have free thou still this swell breast 
I go thus from thou and will never cease 
my vengeance till I find thy heart at peace 

it must not be so stay my eye will tell 
how loath I be to this but love and tear

crown thy fair soul thus I take leave my lord 
and never shall you see the foul Euadne 
till she have try all honour mean that may 
set she in rest and wash her stain away exeunt 

I can tell how I shall credit this 
from you that be his enemy 

I be sure he say it to i and I will justify it 
what way he dare oppose but with my sword 

but do he break without all circumstance 
to you his foe that he will have the fort 
to kill i and then escape 

if he deny it I will make he blush 

it sound incredible 

I so do every thing I say of late 

not so Calianax 

yes I shall sit 
mute while a rogue with strong arm cut your throat 

well I will try he and if this be true 
I will pawn my life I will find it if it be false 
and that you clothe your hate in such a lie 
you shall hereafter dote in your own house 
not in the court 

why if it be a lie 
my ear be false for I be swear I hear it 
old man be good for nothing you be best 
put i to death for hear and free he 
for mean it you will have trust i 
once but the time be alter 

and will still where I may do with justice to the world you have no witness 

yes myself 

no more I mean there be that hear it 

how no more will you have more why be not 
I enough to hang a thousand rogue 

but so you may hang honest man too if you please 

I may it be like I will do so there be a hundred will swear it for a need too if I say it 

such witness we need not 

and it be hard if my word can hang a boisterous knave 

enough where be Strato 

sir enter Strat 

why where be all the company call Amintor in 
Euadne where be my brother and Melantius 
bid he come too and Diphilus call all exit Strat 
that be without there if he shall desire 
the combat of you it be not in the power 
of all our law to hinder it unless 
we mean to quit they 

why if you do think 
it be fit a old man and a counsellor 
to fight for what he say than you may grant it 

Come sir Amintor thou be yet a bridegroom 
and I will use thou so thou shall sit down 
Euadne sit and you Amintor too 
this banquet be for you sir who have bring 
a merry tale about he to raise laughter 
among our wine why Strato where be thou 
thou will chop out with they unseasonable 
when I desire they not 

it be my ill luck sir so to spend they then 

reach i a bowl of wine Melantius thou be sad 

I shall be sir the merry here 
but I have never a story of my own 
worth tell at this time 

give i the wine 
Melantius I be now consider 
how easy it be for any man we trust 
to poison one of we in such a bowl 

I think it be not hard sir for a knave 

such as you be 

i'faith it be easy it become we well 
to get plain deal man about ourselves 
such as you all be here Amintor to thou 
and to thy fair Euadne 

have you think of this Calianax 

yes marry have I 

and what be your resolution 

you shall have it sound I warrant you 

reach to Amintor Strato 

here my love 
this wine will do thou wrong for it will set 
blush upon thy cheek and till thou do 
a fault it be pity 

yet I wonder much 
of the strange desperation of these man 
that dare attempt such act here in our state 
he can not escape that do it 

be he know unpossible 

it will be know Melantius 

it ought to be if he get then away 
he must wear all our life upon his sword 
he need not fly the island he must leave 
no one alive 

no I shall think no man 
can kill i and escape clear but that old man 

but I heaven bless i ay shall I my liege 

I do not think thou will but yet thou may 
for thou have in thy hand the mean to escape 
by keep of the fort he have Melantius 
and he have keep it well 

from cobweb sir 
it be clean sweep I can find no other art 
in keep of it now it be never besiege 
since he command 

I shall be sure of your good word 
but I have keep it safe from such as you 

keep your ill temper in 
I speak no malice have my brother keep it 
I shall have say as much 

you be not merry brother drink wine 
sit you all still Calianax aside 
I can trust thus I have throw out word 
that will have fetch warm blood upon the cheek 
of guilty man and he be never move 
he know no such thing 

impudence may escape when feeble virtue be accuse 

a must if he be guilty feel a alteration 
at this our whisper while we point at he 
you see he do not 

let he hang himself 
what care I what he do this he do say 

Melantius you can easy conceive 
what I have mean for man that be in fault 
can subtle apprehend when other aim 
at what they do amiss but I forgive 
free before this man heaven do so too 
I will not touch thou so much as with shame 
of tell it let it be so no more 

why this be very fine 

I can tell 
what it be you mean but I be apt enough 
rude to thrust into ignorant fault 
but let i know it happy it be nought 
but misconstruction and where I be clear 
I will not take forgiveness of the god 
much less of you 

nay if you stand so stiff I shall call back my mercy 

I want smoothness 
to thank a man for pardon of a crime 
I never know 

not to instruct your knowledge but to show you my ear be everywhere you mean to kill i and get the fort to escape 

pardon i sir my bluntness will be pardon you preserve 
a race of idle people here about you 
facer and talker to defame the world 
of those that do thing worthy the man that utter this 
have perish without food be it who it will 
but for this arm that fence he from the foe 
and if I think you give a faith to this 
the plainness of my nature will speak more 
give i a pardon for you ought to do it 
to kill he that speak this 

I that will be the end of all 
than I be fair pay for all my care and service 

that old man who call my enemy and of who I 
though I will never match my hate so low 
have no good thought will yet I think excuse i 
and swear he think i wrong in this 

who I thou shameless fellow that have speak to i 
of it thyself 

o then it come from he 

from i who shall it come from but from i 

nay I believe your malice be enough 
but I have lose my anger sir I hope 
you be well satisfy 

licip cheer Amintor and his lady there be no sound 
come from you I will come and do it myself 

you have do all ready sir for i I thank you 

Melantius I do credit this from he 
how sleight soever you make it 

it be strange you shall 

it be strange he shall believe a old man word 
that never lie in his life 

I talk not to thou 
shall the wild word of this distemper man 
frantic with age and sorrow make a breach 
betwixt your majesty and i it be wrong 
to hearken to he but to credit he 
as much at least as I have power to bear 
but pardon i while I speak only truth 
I may commend myself I have bestow 
my careless blood with you and shall be loath 
to think an action that will make i lose 
that and my thanks too when I be a boy 
I thrust myself into my country cause 
and do a deed that pluck five year from time 
and style i man then and for you my king 
your subject all have feed by virtue of my arm 
and you yourself have live at home in ease 
so terrible I grow that without sword

and limb be still the same my will as great 
to do you service let i not be pay 
with such a strange distrust 

Melantius I hold it great injustice to believe

I do not let that satisfy what strike 
with sadness all more wine

there shall no credit lie upon thy word 
think better and deliver it 

my liege he be at i now again to do it speak 
deny it if thou can examine he 
while he be hot for if he cool again 
he will forswear it

he have lose himself 
much since his daughter miss the happiness 
my sister gain and though he call i foe 
I pity he 

a pity a pox upon you 

mark his disorder word and at the mask 

Diagoras know he rage and rail at i 
and call a lady whore so innocent 
she understand he not but it become 
both you and i to forgive distraction 
pardon he as I do 

I will not speak for thou for all thy cunning if you will be safe chop off his head for there be never know so impudent a rascal 

some that love he get he to bed why pity shall not let age make itself contemptible we must be all old have he away
