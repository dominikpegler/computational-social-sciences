when many a freeze storm sing through my cuirass 
and make it doubtful whether that or I

and all to try these roman ten time a night 
I have swim the river when the star of Rome 
shoot at i as I float and the billow 
tumble their watery ruin on my shoulder 
charge my batter side with troop of ague 
and still to try these roman who I find 
and if I lie my wound be henceforth backward 
and be you witness god and all my danger 
as ready and as full of that I bring 
which be not fear nor flight as valiant 
as vigilant as wise to do and suffer 
ever advance as forward as the Britain 
their sleep as short their hope as high as we 
ay and as subtle lady it be dishonour 
and follow will be impudence Bonduca 
and grow to no belief to taint these romance 
have not I see the Britain 

what 

dishearted 
run run Bonduca not the quick rack swift 
the virgin from the hate ravisher 
not half so fearful not a flight draw home 
a round stone from a sling a lover wish 
ere make that haste that they have by 
I have see these Britain that you magnify 
run as they will have outrun time and roar 
base for mercy roar the light shadow 
that in a thought scur over the field of corn

I have see thou run too and thou Nennius 
yea run apace both then when Penyus

and drive they headlong on you down the hill 
then when he hunt you like britainfox 
more by the send then sight then do I see 
these valiant and approve man of Britain 
like bode owl creep into tod of ivy 
and hoot their fear to one another nightly 

and what do you then caratach 

I flee too 
but not so fast your jewel have be lose then 
young Hengo there he trash i Nennius 
for when your fear outrun he then step I 
and in the head of all the roman fury 
take he and with my tough belt to my back 
I buckle he behind he my sure shield 
and than I follow if I say I fight 
five time in bring off this bud of Britain 
I lie not Nennius neither have you hear 
i speak this or ever see the child more 
but that the son of virtue Penyus

do this afflict you have the roman cry this 
and as we have do they sing out these fortune 
rail on our base condition hoot at we 
make mark as far as the earth be we to show we 
nothing but sea can stop our flight despise we 
and hold it equal whither banquet 
or beat of the Britain be more business 
it will have gall you 

let i think we conquer 

do but so think as we may be conquer 
and where we have find virtue though in those 
that come to make we slave let we cherish it 
there be not a blow we give since Julius land 
that be of strength and worth but like record 
they file to afterage our register 
the roman be for noble deed of honour 
and shall we burn their mention with upbraid 

no more I see myself thou have make i cousin 
more than my fortune dare for they abuse i 
and wound i up so high I swell with glory 
thy temperance have cure that tympany 
and give i health again nay more discretion 
shall we have peace for now I love these roman 

thy love and hate be both unwise one lady 

your reason 

be not peace the end of arm 

not where the cause imply a general conquest 
have we a difference with some petty isle 
or with our neighbour lady for our landmark 
the take in of some rebellious lord 
or make a head against commotion 
after a day of blood peace may be argue 
but where we grapple for the ground we live on 
the liberty we hold as dear as life 
the god we worship and next those our honour 
and with those sword that know no end of battle 
those man beside themselves allow no neighbour 
those mind that where the day be claim inheritance 
and where the sun make ripe the fruit their harvest 
and where they march but measure out more ground 
to add to Rome and here in the bowel on we 
it must not be no as they be our foe 
and those that must be so until we tire they 
let be use the peace of honour that be fair deal 
but in our end our sword that hardy roman 
that hope to graft himself into my stock 
must first begin his kindred under ground 
and be ally in ash 

Caratach 
as thou have noble speak shall be do 
and Hengo to thy charge I here deliver

piece to my neverfailing strength and fortune 
steer through these swell danger blow their pride up 
and bear like thunder through their loud tempest 
they keep the field still 

confident and full 

in such a number one will swear they grow 
the hill be wooded with their partisan 
and all the valley overgrow with dart 
as moor be with rank rush no ground leave we 
to charge upon no room to strike say fortune

as if it be my diet yet noble general 
it be a wisdom learn from you I learn it 
and worthy of a soldier care most worthy 
to weigh with most deliberate circumstance 
the end of accident above their offer 
how to go on and get to save a roman 
who one life be more worth in way of do 
than million of these paint wasp how view 
to find advantage out how find to follow it 
with counsel and discretion lest mere fortune 
shall claim the victory 

it be true Petillius 
and worthy remember the rule be certain 
their use no less excellent but where time 
cut off occasion danger time and all 
tend to a present peril it be require 
our sword and manhood be best counsellor 
our expedition precedent to win be nothing 
where reason time and counsel be our campmaster 
but there to bear the field than to be conqueror 
where pale destruction take we take we beat 
in want and mutiny ourselves but handful 
and to ourselves our own fear need a new way 
a sudden and a desperate execution 
here how to save be loss to be wise dangerous 
only a present wellunited strength 
and mind make up for all attempt dispatch it 
dispute and delay here cool the courage 
necessity give time for doubt thing infinite 
accord to the spirit they be preach to 
reward like they and name for afterage 
must steel the soldier his own shame help to arm he 
and have force his spirit ere he cool 
fling he upon his enemy sudden and swift 
like tiger among fox we must fight for it 
fury must be our fortune shame we have lose 
spur ever in our side to prick we forward 
there be no other wisdom nor discretion 
due to this day of ruin but destruction 
the soldier order first and then his anger 

no doubt they dare redeem all 

then no doubt 
the day must needs be we that the proud woman 
be infinite in number better like i 
than if we deal with squadron half her army 
shall choke themselves their own sword dig their grave 
I will tell you all my fear one single valour 
the virtue of the valiant caratach 
more doubt i then all Britain he be a soldier 
so forge out and so temper for great fortune 
so much man thrust into he so old in danger 
so fortunate in all attempt that his mere name

and crowd in among a nameless press

who virtue like the sun exhale all valour 
must not be lose in mist and fog of people 
noteless and out of name but rude and naked 
nor can Rome task we with impossibility 
or bid we fight against a flood we serve she

nor slave to choke all hazard who but fool 
that make no difference betwixt certain die 
and die well will fling their fame and fortune

it can be he dare out live this fortune 
he must die it be most necessary man expect it 
and thought of life in he go beyond coward 
forsake the field so base fie upon it 
so poor to betray his worth so cold 
to cut all credit from the soldier sure 
if this man mean to live as I shall think it 
beyond belief he must retire where never 
the name of Rome the voice of arm or honour 
be know or hear of yet he be certain dead 
or strong mean it he be no soldier else 
no roman in he all he have do but outside 
fight either drink or desperate now he rise 
how do lord Penyus 

as you see 

I be glad on it 
continue so still the lord general 
the valiant general great Swetonius 

no more of i be speak my name be perish 

he that command fortune and the day 
by his own valour and discretion 
when as some say Penyus refuse to come 
but I believe they not send i to see you 

you be welcome and pray see i see i well 
you shall not see i long 

I hope so Penyus 
the god defend sir 

see i and understand i this be he 
leave to fill up your triumph he that base 
whistle his honour off to the wind that cold 
shrink in his politic head when Rome like reaper 
sweat blood and spirit for a glorious harvest 
and bind it up and bring it off that fool 
that have gold and copper offer he 
refuse the wealth and take the waste that soldier 
that be court by loud fame and fortune 
labour in one hand that propound we god 
and in the other glory that create we 
yet dare doubt and be damn 

it be a error 

a foul one and a black one 

yet the black 
may be wash white again 

never 

your leave sir 
and I beseech you note i for I love you 
and bring along all comfort be we god 
ally to no infirmity be our nature 
more than man nature when we slip a little 
out of the way of virtue be we lose 
be there no medicine call sweet mercy 

None Petillius 
there be no mercy in mankind can reach i 
nor be it fit it shall I have sin beyond it 

forgiveness meet with all fault 

it be all fault 
all sin I can commit to be forgive 
it be loss of whole man in i my discretion 
to be so stupid to arrive at pardon 

o but the general 

he be a brave gentleman 
a valiant and a love and I dare say 
he will as far as honour dare direct he 
make even with my fault but it be not honest 
nor in his power example that may nourish 
neglect and disobedience in whole body 
and totter the estate and faith of army 
must not be play withal nor out of pity 
make a general forget his duty 
nor dare I hope more from he then be worthy 

what will you do 

die 

so will sullen child 
woman that want their will slave disobedient 
that fear the law die fie great captain you 
a man to rule man to have thousand life 
under your regiment and let your passion 
betray your reason I bring you all forgiveness 
the noble kind commend your place your honour 

prithee no more it be foolish do not thou 
by thou do I overhear thou there 
there where thou stand now deliver i for rascal 
poor dead cold coward miserable wretched 
if I outlive this ruin 

I 

and thou do it noble 
like a true man a soldier and I thank thou 
I thank thou good Petillius thus I thank thou 

since you be so just make up let i tell you 
it be fit you die indeed 

o how thou love i 

for say he have forgive you say the people whisper 
be tame again the time run out for wonder 
what must your own command think from who sword 
you have take off the edge from who valour 
the due and recompense of arm nay make it doubtful 
whether they know obedience must not these kill you 
say they be win to pardon you by mere miracle 
bring to forgive you what old valiant soldier 
what man that love to fight and fight for Rome 
will ever follow you more dare you know these venture 
if so I bring you comfort dare you take it 

no no Petillius no 

if your mind serve you 
you may live still but how yet pardon i 
you may outwear all too but when and certain 
there be a mercy for each fault if tame 
a man will take it upon condition 

no by no mean I be only think now sir 
for I be resolve to go of a most base death 
fit the baseness of my fault I will hang 

you shall not you be a gentleman I honour 
I will else flatter you and force you live 
which be far base hang it be a dog death 
a end for slave 

the fit for my baseness 

beside the man that be hang preach his end and sit a sign for all the world to gape at 

that be true I will take a fit poison 

no 
it be equal ill the death of rat and woman 
lover and lazy boy that fear correction 
die like a man 

why my sword then 

ay if your sword be sharp sir 
there be nothing under heaven that be like your sword 
your sword be a death indeed 

it shall be sharp sir 

why Mithridates be a arrant ass 
to die by poison if all Bosphorus 
can lend he sword your sword must do the deed 
it be shame to die choke fame to die and bleed 

thou have confirm i and my good Petillius

but now I see you in a noble way 
a way to make all even
