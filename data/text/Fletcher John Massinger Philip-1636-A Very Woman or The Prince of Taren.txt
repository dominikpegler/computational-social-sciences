be torture with suspicion to lose she 
before I have enjoy she the next sun 
shall see she i why shall I doubt then yet 
to doubt be safe than to be secure 
but one short day great empire in less time 
have suffer change she be constant but a woman

what madman that come hither with that pomp 
don John Antonio do that exact courtier 
don John Antonio with who brave fame only 
great princess have fall in love and die 
that come with such assurance as young Paris

disgrace and scorn his large expense laugh at 
his bravery scoff the lady that he court 
leave quiet in possession of another 
not to be name that day a courtier 
where he be mention the scarce know cardenes 
and he to bear she from he that will ever 
be see again have get fair off 
by such as will live ready witness 
of his repulse and scandal 

the grief of it 
believe i will not kill i all man honour 
depend not on the most uncertain favour 
of a fair mistress 

troth you bear it well 
you shall have see some that be sensible 
of a disgrace that will have rage and seek 
to cure their honour with some strange revenge 
but you be better temper and they wrong 
the neapolitan in their report 
that say they be fiery spirit uncapable 
of the least injury dangerous to be talk with 
after a loss where nothing can move you 
but like a stoic with a constancy 
word nor affront can shake you still go on 
and smile when man abuse you 

if they wrong 
themselves I can yet I will have you know 
I dare be angry

for which that savage homicide be send hither 
thou equal judge of all thing if that blood 
and innocent blood 

o cardenes 
how be my soul rend between rage and sorrow 
that it can be that such a upright cedar 
shall violent be tear up by the root 
without a earthquake in that very moment 
to swallow they that do it 

the hurt be nothing 
but the deep wound be in my conscience friend 
which sorrow in death only can recover 

have better hope 


my son be this the marriage 
I come to celebrate false hope of man 
I come to find a grave here 

I have waste 
my stock of tear and now just anger help i 
to pay in my revenge the other part 
of duty which I owe thou o great sir 
not as a daughter now but a poor widow 
make so before she be a bride I fly 
to your impartial justice the offence 
be death and death in his most horrid form 
let not then title or a prince name 
since a great crime be in a great man great 
secure the offender 

give i life for life 
as thou will answer it to the great king 
who deputy thou be here 

and speedy justice 

put the damn wretch to torture 

force he to 
reveal his curse confederate which spare not 
although you find a son among they 

how 

why bring you not the rack forth 

wherefore stand the murderer unbind 

shall I have hear 

excellent lady in this you express 
your true love to the dead 

all love to mankind from i end with he 

will you hear i yet 
and first to you you do confess the fact 
with which you stand charge 

I will not make worse 
what be already ill with vain denial 

then understand though you be prince of tarent 
yet be a subject to the king of Spain 
no privilege of Sicily can free you 
be convict by a just form of law 
from the municipal statute of that kingdom 
but as a common man be find guilty 
must suffer for it 

I prize not my life 
so much as to appeal from any thing 
you shall determine of i 

yet despair not 
to have a equal hear the exclaim 
of this grieve father nor my daughter tear 
shall sway i from myself and where they urge 
to have you torture or lead bind to prison 
I must not grant it 

no 

I can sir 
for man of his rank be to be distinguish 
from other man before they be condemn 
from which his cause not hear he yet stand free 
so take he to your charge and as your life 
see he be safe 

let i die for he else 

the guard of he shall have be give to i 

or unto i 

bribe may corrupt the captain 

and our just wreak by force or cunning practice 
with scorn prevent 

oh 

what groan be that 

they be apparent sign of life yet in he 

o that there be that I can pour my blood 
into his vein 

o o 

take he up gentle 

Run for physician 

surgeon 

all help else 

this care of his recovery timely practise 
will have express more of a father in you 
than your impetuous clamour for revenge 
but I shall find fit time to urge that further 
hereafter to you it be not fit for i 
to add weight to oppress calamity 


why shall your love to i have already 
so oft endure the test be put unto 
a needless trial have you not long since 
in every circumstance and rite of friendship 
outgo all precedent the ancient boast of 
and will you yet move further 

hitherto 
I have do nothing howsoever you value 
my weak endeavour that may just claim 
a title to your friendship and much less 
lay down the debt which as a tribute due 
to your deserve not I but mankind 
stand bind to tender 

do not make a idol 
of he that shall and without superstition 
to you build up a altar o my Pedro 
when I be to expire to call you i 
assure a future happiness give i leave 
to argue with you and the fondness of 
affection strike blind with justice hear i 
why shall you be innocent fling your life 
into the furnace of your father anger 
for my offence or take it grant yet 
it be more than supposition you prefer 
my safety before your own so prodigal 
you waste your favor wherefore shall this captain 
his blood and sweat reward in the favour 
of his great master falsify the trust 
which from true judgement he repose in he 
for i a stranger 

let he answer that 
he need no prompter speak your thought and free 

I ever love to do so and it shame not 
the bluntness of my breed from my youth 
I be train up a soldier one of those 
that in their nature love the danger more 
than the reward of danger I can add 
my life when forfeit the viceroy pardon 
but by his intercession and therefore 
it be lend by he I be ungrateful 
which I will never be if I refuse 
to pay that debt at any time demand 

I hope friend this will satisfy you 

no it raise 
more doubt within i shall I from the school 
of gratitude in which this captain read 
the text so plain learn to be unthankful 
or view in your action the idea 
of perfect friendship when it do point to i 
how brave a thing it be to be a friend 
turn from the object have I never love 
the fair Almira for her outward feature 
nay be the beauty of her mind suspect 
and her contempt and scorn paint before i 
the being your sister will anew inflame i 
with much more impotence to dote upon she 
no dear friend let i in my death confirm 
though you in all thing else have the precedence 
I will die ten time ere one of Pedro hair 
shall suffer in my cause 

if you so love i 
in love to that part of my soul dwell in you 
for though two body friend have but one soul 
loose not both life and i 


the prince be dead 

if so shall I leave Pedro here to answer 
for my escape as thus I clasp thou let 
the viceroy sentence find i 

fly for heaven sake 
consider the necessity though now 
we part Anthonio we may meet again 
but death division be for ever friend 


the rumor spread sir of Martino death 
be check there be hope of his recovery 

why shall I fly then when I may enjoy 
with my own life my friend 

that be still uncertain 
he may have a relapse for once be rule friend 
he be a good debtor that pay when it be due 
a prodigal that before it be require 
make tender of it 


the bark sir be ready 

the wind sit fair 

heaven favor your escape 

hark how the boatswain whistle you aboard 
will nothing move you 

can I leave my friend 

I must delay no long force he home 

I will run the hazard of my fortune with you 

what violence be this hear but my reason 

poor friendship that be cool with argument 
away away 

for Malta 

you shall hear 
all our event 

I may sail round the world 
but never meet thy like Pedro 

Anthonio 

I breathe my soul back to thou 

in exchange 
bear my along with thou 

cheerly my heart 

he be go May pittyingheaven his pilot be 
and then I weigh not what become of i 


I tell you right sir 

yes like a rough surgeon 
without a feel in yourself you search 
my wound unto the quick then pray declare 
the tediousness and danger of the cure 
never remember what the patient suffer 
but you preach this philosophy to a man 
that do partake of passion and not 
to a dull stoic 

I confess you have 
just cause to mourn your son and yet if reason 
can yield comfort let example cure 
I be a father too my only daughter 
as dear in my esteem perhaps as worthy 
as your Martino in her love to he 
as desperate ill either loss equal 
and yet I bear it with a better temper 


which if you please to imitate it will not wrong 
your piety nor your judgement 

we be fashion in different mould 
I weep with my own eye sir pursue my end too 
pity to you be a cordial 
revenge to i and that I must and will have 
if my Martino die 

your must and will 
shall in your full sail confidence deceive you 

here be doctor Paulo sir 


my hand you rather 
deserve my knee and it shall bend as to 
a second father if your save aid 
restore my son 

rise thou bright star of knowledge 
the honour of thy art thou help of nature 
thou glory of our academy 

if I blush sir 
to hear these attribute ill place on i 
it be excusable I be no god sir 
nor holy saint that can do miracle 
but a weak sinful man yet that I may 
in some proportion deserve these favor 
your excellency please to grace i with 
I promise all the skill I have acquire 
in simples or the careful observation 
of the superior body with my judgement 
derive from long experience stand ready 
to do you service 

modest reply 

how be it with you princely patient 

speak 
but speak some comfort sir 

I must speak truth 
his wound though many heaven so guide yet 
anthonio sword it pierce no part be mortal 
these gentleman who worthy deserve 
the name of surgeon have do their duty 
the mean they practise not ridiculous charm 
to stop the blood no oil nor balsam buy 
of cheat quacksalver or montebank 
by they apply the rule by Chiron teach 
and Aesculapius which draw upon he 
the thunderer envy they with care pursue 
heaven prosper their endeavour 

there be hope then 
of his recovery 

but no assurance 
I must not flatter you that little air 
of comfort that breathe towards we for I dare not 
rob these to enrich myself you owe their care 
for yet I have do nothing 

still more modest 
I will begin with they to either give 
three thousand crown 

I will double your reward 
see they pay present 

this magnificence 
with equity can be confer on we 
it be due unto the doctor 

true we be 
but his subordinate minister and do only 
follow your grave direction 

it be your own 
I challenge no part in it 

brave on both side 

deserve this with the honour that will follow 
in your attendance 

if both sleep at once 
it be justice both shall die 

for you grave doctor 
we will not in such petty sum consider 
your high desert our treasury lie open 
command it as your own 

choose any castle 
nay city in our government and be lord of it 

of neither sir I be not so ambitious 
nor will I have your highness secure 
we have but faint yet begin our journey 
a thousand difficulty and danger must be 
encounter ere we end it though his hurt 
I mean his outward one do promise fair 
there be a deep one and in his mind 
must be with care provide for melancholy 
and at the height too near of kin to madness 
possess he his sense be distract 
not one but all and if I can collect they 
with all the various way invention 
or industry ever practise I shall write it 
my masterpiece 

you more and more engage i 

may we not visit he 

by no mean sir 
as he be now such courtesy come untimely 
I will yield you reason for it shall he look on you 
it will renew the memory of that 
which I will have forget your good prayer 
and those I do presume shall not be want 
to my endeavour be the utmost aid 
I yet desire your excellency shall grant i 
so with my humble service 

go and prosper 

observe his piety I have hear how true 
I know not most physician as they grow 
great in skill grow less in their religion 
attribute so much to natural cause 
that they have little faith in that they can 
deliver reason for this doctor steer 
another course but let this pass if you please 
your company to my daughter 

I wait on you 

take she no rest tonight 

not any madam 
I be sure she sleep not if she slumber straight 
as if some dreadful vision have appear 
she start up her hair unbind and with 
distract look stare about the chamber 
she ask aloud where be Martino where 
have you conceal he sometime name Anthonio 
tremble in every joint her brow contract 
her fair face as it be change into a curse 
her hand hold up thus and as if her word 
be too big to find passage through her mouth 
she groan then throw herself upon her bed 
beat her breast 

it be wondrous strange 

nay more 
she that of late vouchsafe not to be see 
but so adorn as if she be to rival 
Nero Poppea or the egyptian queen 
now careless of her beauty when we offer 
our service she contemn it 

do she not 
sometime forsake her chamber 

much about 
this hour then with a strange unsettle gate 
she measure twice or thrice the gallery 
silent and frown we dare not speak to she 
and then return she be come pray you now observe she 


why be my eye fix on the ground and not 
bend upward ha that which be mortal of 
my dear Martino as a debt to nature 
I know this mother earth have sepulchre 
but his divine part his soul over which 
the tyrant death nor yet the fatal sword 
of curse Anthonio his instrument 
have the least power bear upon angel wing

create of that pureness book persuade we 
we understand not sure nor feel that sweetness 
that man call virtue chain to link our action 
our imperfection form and flatter we

in patience tarent overcome i more 
than in my wound live then no more to man
