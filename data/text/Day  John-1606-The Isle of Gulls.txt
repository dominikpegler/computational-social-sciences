how now gallant what be it what be it 

the I will of gull 

the I will of gull what shall that be 

a play by the name but come shall we quarter ourselves 

if some have have the wit to do so in time they may have save the hangman a labour but come boy furnish we with stool 

pardon i sir my office be to speak a prologue not to provide you stool 

and you be the epilogue to sir 

fie be not incivil do hear youth prithee what be he that discover your new find land the I will of gull what be he 

a mere stranger sir 

a stranger the better welcome come he eastward westward or northward hoe 

none of the three way I assure you 

prithee where be he 

not on his knee in a corner to Apollo pray that his play may hold in a good hand at passage not on the stage among gallant prepare a bespeak plaudite but close in his study write hard to get he a handsome suit against summer 

and where sit his friend have he not a prepare company of gallant to applaud his jest and grace out his play 

None I protest do poet use to bespeak their auditory 

the best in grace do and but for that some that I know have never have their grace in poetry till this day 

then must our author look for a certain disgrace for he be altogether unfurnish of such a friendly audience 

then he must lay his trial upon God and good wit but why do he call his play the I will of gull it beget much expectation 

not out of any dogged disposition not that it figure a  certain state or private government far be that supposition from the thought of any indifferent auditor and the argument be a little string or rivulet draw from the full strain of the right worthy gentleman sir Philip sydney well know Archadea confirm it only a duke to make trial of certain experiment retire with his retinue into a nameless desert now as well for fashion sake as that all those which have to do in that desert be gull in the reach of their hope therefore he call it and as he presume not improper the I will of gull 

out a question he have promise thou some fee thou plead so hard for he but and he be a right poet he will never perform it but what method observe he in his play be it any thing critical be lawyer fee and citizen wife lay open in it I love to hear vice anatomize and abuse let blood in the master vain be there any great man life character in it 

None I protest sir only in the person of Dametas he express to the life the monstrous and deform shape of vice aswell to beget a loathe of abuse as that his villainy may give the great luster to the virtuous disposition of trueborn gentility 

all that be nothing to i and there be not wormwood water and copperes in it I will not like it shall Apollo write it and Rosius himself act it 

fie upon thou thou be too too critical be there any good bawdry in it jest of a ell deep and a fathom broad good cuckold may a couple of youngsetter up learn to do well in it give i a scene of venery that will make a man spirit stand on their tiptoe and die his blood in a deep scarlet like your Ovid ars amandi there flow the true springhead of poetry and the very crystal fount of Parnassus 

chaste ear will never endure it sir 

chaste ear now deafness light upon they what shall chaste ear do at a play 

it be strange now I be of neither a both your opinion I like neither rail nor bawdry no give i a stately pen history as thus the rugged wind with rude and ragged ruff etc 

fie upon it mere fustian I have rather hear two good bawdy jest than a whole play of such tearecat thunderclap 

Alas gentleman how be it possible to content you you will have rail and invective which our author neither dare nor affect you bawdy and scurrile jest which neither become his modesty to write nor the ear of a generous auditory to hear you must have swell comparison and bombast epithet which be as fit for the body of a Comedy as Hercules shoe for the foot of a pygmy yet all these we must have and all in one play or it be already condemn to the hell of eternal disgrace 

look to it if there be not gall in it it shall not pass 

if it be not bawdy it be impossible to pass 

if it be both critical and bawdy if it be not high write both your poet and the house to lose a friend of i 

nay I beseech you sir if you be his friend stand so to he still for he have too many enemy already in who judgement he and his labour stand excommunicate as though unworthy to present themselves in this assembly 

enemy nay foot then there be some hope in his play for envy never work but against desert and merit if he be envy there be some worth in he and I will see out his play for that only 

faith and I will see a act or two out but I tell you aforehand I can see it out 

not see it out your reason 

fore God I lie in bed till past three o'clock sleep out my dinner and my stomach will toll to supper afore five therefore you must pardon i 

either see it all or none for it be grow into a custom at play if any one rise especial of any fashionable sort about what serious business soever the rest think it in dislike of the play though he never think it cry mew by jesus vild and leave the poor heartless child to speak their epilogue to the empty seat 

why do think thy audience like a flock of sheep that one can leap over a hedge but all the rest will follow they have more of reason in they then so 

well I will sit out the play and be but to avoid that sheepish imputation but see it be bawdy or by this light I and all my friend will hiss 

you shall not deal gentlemanlike with we else 

the misery that wait upon the pen 
of the best writer judge it gentleman 
let they express the very soul of wit 
and want opinion voice to countenance it 
it be like the idle buzz of a fly 
hear not regard wretched poetry 
if he write mirth it be ribaldry and mean 
scorn of chaste ear if he compose a scene 
of high writ poesy fit a true stage 
it be count fustian if portick rage 
strike at abuse or open the vain of sin 
he be straight inform against for libel 
neither quick mirth invective nor high state 
can content all such be the boundless hate 
of a confuse audience then we 
that scarce know the rule of poesy 
can escape check yet this our comfort be 
the wise will smile to hear the impartial hiss 
we neither brag nor tremble faint nor entreat 
our merit nothing yet our hope be great 
yet this our author bid i bold speak 
his play shall pass let envy swell and break 
detraction he scorn honour the best 
tanti for hate thus low to all the rest 

welcome gallant welcome honour blood the reason that we have unclothe we of our princely government in Arcadia and have to do with this private retirement here in this desert I will you shall find in that schedule only thus much for public satisfaction it be not strange to you that the choice treasure nature endow we with be mind up in the vein of my two daughter how much their quiet and the smooth stream of our government in Arcadia be trouble by the impetuous concourse of unruly suitor be familiar with your knowledge this to avoid I have for my image there in my absence appoint my brother and undertake this private retirement 

why my lord be you so covetous of your daughter beauty that their perfection shall be a mean to hinder their preferment 

Rather to further it fair queen they be the only pearl of our age and to see they well set in honourable and wellbefitting 
marriage be our wish happiness 
to which effect we have send a general challenge 
to all the youthful blood of Africa 
that whosoever bear of princely stem 
dare foot the bosom of this desert I will 
the stage where I will perform this lover prize 
and by his wit and active policy 
woo win entice or any way defeat 
i of my charge my daughter of their heart 
shall with their love wear my imperial crown 
wreathe of their conquest 

a prize a prize rare work for fencer 

what coward will not venture a crack crown for such a booty 

to that intent our island be fence in 
by sea and land and at each corner build 
a castle for defence which like great man 
do overlook Archadea over which 
we have appoint captain more to desire 
be more than we be willing to discover 

well then sister I see we must to haphazard for husband 

God send i one with a good face and I care not 

love and be thy will send i one with a fair table in his forehead like time 

nay and his face be good let i alone to trick his forehead a countrygentlewoman teach i how but father I wonder how you dare undertake such a peremptory challenge against all comer consider you have be so long trouble with a ague 

a ague what ague 

why your quotidian Dametas the court surfeit he that dwell in your eye like a disease in your blood 

and the presence be not exceed emptystomached it will never digest such almesbasketscrap the very fall and garbage of gentry fie upon he he become the great chamber worse than a gentlemanusher with wry leg 

he be the most misshape suit of gentility that ever the court wear 

have he not be of my father own make I shall have condemn his tailor for a exceed butcher 

if you retain the love of child or the duty of subject express it in your obedience we know Dametas love we 

as captain and courtier do old widow for profit and preferment 

in sign whereof we make he 

nay you have bestow too much of the make of he up already 

the very make of he up have stand you in more than the whole our side worth 

in my free thought you wrong he therefore to express our love and to give the world public note of his loyalty we create he your guardian 

how father my guardian 

I minion you 

do you hear father bid he bespeak spectacle for my finger have vow to have a blind match with his eye 

Well say Haggart I will make your proud heart stoop to the lure of obedience but come by this time our challenge be publish and our gallant wit sweat in the field of invention and it behoove we not to rest unexercised 
so to our lodge in the mean time be it know 
our breath have power to raise or cast man down 

now captain observation time bawd thou that have keep the age door while upstart baseness creep into the bed of greatness what do thou think of this change 

that it please the duke and become not subject to examine his action 

that be no part of my meaning yet will I glad be better instruct why the duke break up his court in Archadea and remove it into this island 

I be not secretary to his thought but the general mmour be that out of the freeness of his spirit he have send a challenge to all his neighbour prince that whosoever within a twelvemonth can defeat he of his daughter shall with their love enjoy his dukedom the garland propose for the victor 

your word throw sense into i and that be the cause the island be so sure guard with watchtower over which ourselves and other captain have the charge 

and to the end that not affection but desert may prove victor be the two lady so narrow observe the one never out of the eye of her father the other continual in the lodge of Dametas the duke chief director 

if inquisitiveness be not too bold a guest what do you think of Dametas 

as of a little hillock make great with other ruin 

your comparison hold for by report his avarice have unmake many to make he up 

how do he first stumble on the prince favour 

as some do upon office by fortune and flattery or as truth say the prince have one day lose his way wander in the wood find this Dametas affect his discourse take he along to the court and like great man in love with their own do countenance his defect give he office title and all the addition that go to the make up of a man worshipful 

I can but commend the duke for raise he nor yet praise he that he proportion not his carriage answerable to his fortune 

your thought and i be twin in that but I hear the warn bell some stranger be arrive 

let we to our office then and conduct they to Dametas who custom be to spit and hem while his scribe Maior take their examination 

Manasses how do like my play at tennis 

you play well sir but you lose still 

policy Manasses policy for when any man upbraid i with my get at court I may swear true I have lose more than I have get bite 

by the tennis court I think you have 

if by any court it be enough to save my oath 
but what do our spruce witted gallant say of my bounty 

faith sir accord to the proportion of it little or nothing they say it be a bankrupt and dare not show his head 

then let they leave rest at i though it please the duke for some few good part that he see in i to make i his familiar I scorn to be public or every courtier companion but who come here 
the captain of the watchtower what news with you 

a couple of petitioner an it like your worship 

have I best take their petition Manasses 

o in any case though you never peruse they it be the only course in request 

fellow deliver your petition to my scribe mayor and do hear put they up Manasses they may be wrong to we 

and they be I hope they be not the first wrong I have put up for your worship 

that fellow pocket be like a tailor hell it eat up part of every man due it be a executioner and make away more innocent petition in one year than a redheaded hang man cut rope in a age 

now what be you sirrah 

a poor soldier an it like your worship 

poor soldier do not like my worship they be bad member 

then if they have a woman to their judge they shall be sure to be cut off for they can endure bid member in a commonwealth 

what be you 

a poor scholar an it like your worship 

poor scholar do not like our worship neither they rail against rich cormorant they be bad member to 

cut they off both sir and make the land a eunuch 

I will take order with they I warrant thou and I may have my will I will have neither poor scholar nor soldior about the court 

the next way to make it the I will of fool 

what be he talk of fool there why how now sir know you to who you speak 

cry your worship mercy I have forget your authority 

but I remember well enough I warrant you I command you in my name and the duke to attend your guard and you regard i no more than a careless lawyer do a undo cliant but I will inform the duke shall know out pack 

command your slave sir we be gentleman 

why so I hope be we sir and of the best and last edition of the duke own make 

cry your authority mercy will you discharge we of these passenger 

you be discharge about your business 

bad fate that wrong shall set his foot on right and true bear eagle stoop to this base kite 

what a excellent trade it be to be a officer maker I will have more officer and one shall be to keep scholar and soldier out of the court for they dare not come in the great chamber already for want of good clothes but god i Manasses go tell the duke I must speak with he 

present sir I will go fetch the head to give the foot a posset and my master have wit to his villainy he will make a excellent dish for the hangman 

right worshipful 

ay sir I know my place be worshipful I tell thou knave I can hang thou by my patent if it be grant once I will tell thou how it run it allow i 24 knave 6 knight 10 fool 13 felon and 14 traitor by the year take they how why when and where I please 

I do not think the duke will ever grant it 

why not grant it why shall you think he will not grant it such another word and I will send you to limbo instant 

we thank you good Dametas 

I hope you will take reasonable bail for our forthcoming 

the case be alter with you since you come out of Archadea 

my honourable friend julio and aminter myself and the best ability of my power lie at your service 

you see how confident we presume upon your letter promise in further we to attain the lover prize 

the duke daughter be your own and in a word thus shall you attain they some 3 day hence I will appoint a hunt to which I will invite the duke and both his daughter in this hunt will I upon some sudden occasion divide the train and have single out the two doe I hope you have wit enough to strike 

to strike how mean you 

as headsman do of with their maidenhead or if the duke offer resistance of with his crown to 

that be violence and clean opposite to the intent of the challenge 

come you be shallow to it vi et armis to it I will be your second think of the crown ha my letter travail for you my wit wrought for you and my invention sweat for you to possess you of your love and seat you in the dukedom and come you now with it be violence and against the intent of the challenge I be ashamed to hear you 

nay Dametas and your resolution be so forward we shall overtake you we doubt least the preferment your lord have heap upon you have smother your affection to we ward 

that be the father that beget the doubt in we you will appoint the hunt 

Sever the duke divide the train and then 

we have your meaning 

put it in execution then but first entertain some new disguise as at our next meeting I will inform you adieu I shall think long till I see you again 

as a lawyer do for his cliant for a second see here be no judas 

yes and a damn one to for he will betray and sell his master 

it be common in such base fellow such courtspider that weave their web of flattery in the ear of greatness if they can once entangle they in their quaint treachery they poison they straight 

they be like unnecessary worm who the son of greatness create of the gross and slimy multitude as soon as they recover strength they eat into the credit of true bear gentry undermine and work out the true nobility to enroot and establish themselves 

and in the end like Esop starve snake have leap the sweet milk of greatness make themselves strong in authority and friend they turn their sting of envy into their preserver bosom 

the example live in this Dametas who notwithstanding the duke have raise he to that height that he look equal with himself yet for the base hope of incertain government he offer he to sale but let his treason live to the last minute 

for my part I will make that use of he that physician do of poison use as much of he as serve for my honest intent and cast down the rest as unfit for any necessary employment 

let our carriage in this attempt put on no show of violence either to the duke or his daughter 

and let our discourse go so smooth apparel that it move not the patience of the most tender ear 

about it then though his intent be base 
our enterprise shall wear a noble face 

Archadea thou heaven within who sphere 
the star that guide my motion be fix 
I court thy gracious bosom with a kiss 
for this admittance in thy amorous arm 
fair Violetta fair than the flower 
that christen she and grace she with that name 
do play the wanton 
only her father like a covetous churl 
owner of that value diamond 
have make this desert I will the unwilling chest 
in which he lock she but the fair advantage 
of this large challenge and my star to friend 
aid by this disguise I shall break open 
his iron casket and enlarge my hope 

this way she go sir this way 

but I say this way I will thou shall know we old courtier can hunt a coney and put she to the squeak and make she cry out like a young marry wife of the first night 

for more help as some of they have do 
but there she be 

I will upon she present do hear i sirrah thou vessel of infirmity woman and by thy outside little better than one of the wicked come hither and show thyself before we show thyself before Dametas 

Dametas Lisander then dissemble 
for he be the man must work thy entrance 

what be thou speak 

my mother be the queen of Amazon 
myself a virgin marry unto arm 
and bold achievement who have pace the world 
in quest of fair autioste my sister 
and turn homeward the inconstant wind 
and wrathful Neptune cast i on this shore 

and what be your business now you be land 

my business be private with the duke 

the duke be busy and shall speak with nobody 

I beseech you sir 

it be no beseech matter I assure you 

no never beseech for the matter for except you can beseech with the tongue of angel it be to no purpose with he 

it be strange I have hear thy master be a very good man where he take 

true where he take he be but he take nothing of you and therefore look for no kindness from he 

good and do thou take after thy master 

no madam I take common afore my master for where he take he take all and leave nothing for i to take 

o I feel your meaning 

let my master have some feel of you and he will preset your suit 

it be not the duke pleasure petitioner shall buy their access 

all be one it be my master pleasure and usual fashion 

and I must maintain the fashion worshipful Dametas my late shipwreck as you see have make a defeat both of my friend and treasure notwithstanding fortune have reserve i one jewel which if I may request your worship in love to accept and be a mean to work my admittance to the duke I shall become a true debtor to your love 

well madam though I hate nothing more than a man that take bribe yet press by your importunity and that you tender it in love lest I may seem too nice to withstand a lady favour I will wear it for your sake and if the duke be not too busy employ work your access 

so do you shall perform the office of a dearbought friend 

how quick the tide be turn but do you hear madam though I take neither afore nor after my master yet take my counsel and do not trust my master if you have a suit to the duke keep it to yourself for if you trust my master with it he will prefer it for you but he will beg for himself 

that be plain cozenage 

fie no it be cunning in he marry it will be though little better than cozenage in a country gentleman but he return 

madam I have be earnest very earnest with the duke for your admittance 

and have you wrought it 

I have marry you must think I bestow much labour in it 

it may be you do 

it may be you do and look a scance like a apothecary wife pound colliquintida have my brain sweat for this 

why the jewel be right Dametas have I but a ass that will sweat i such pearl 

a ass and sweat such pearl I will bar her admittance here take your jewel the duke will allow no admittance and I will keep you back 

keep i back thou can do no more and I be a poor man petitioner 

and I will do so much be a rich petitioner 

you can sir you court spaniel you unnecessary mushroom that in one night art spring out of the root of greatness I have buy my admittance and I will hate in dspetto del fato 

I must admit she these lady be so inward with our trick there be no good to be do upon they well madam your admittance be open will you follow 

with all my heart sir I will be the blind man and poor petitioner and thou shall play the court spaniel with the silver bell and I cad i into the presence 

court spaniel mum I will bosom what I think 
old Gibs not blind I see although I wink 

boy how do like i in this attire 

as the audience do a bad play scurvy 

be it not strange a prince shall be thus metamorphose 

not so strange as the metamorphosis of Aiax and like your grace 

grace you aggot have not forget that yet 

no and yet it be a wonder I have not grace be so seldom use I be sure they say none at some ordinary for at sit down they can intend it for hunger and at rise up they be either drink or have such mind a dice they never remember my lord then 

no more lord sirrah 

indeed there be many already but be not this strange that rich man shall forsake their title master then 

your will sir 

you have leave many country behind you in seek your friend Lisander and yet you can find he 

true sir 

I have see much gold lie upon Lombard stall and can never finger penny of it 

very well 

nay it be not well sir 

what conclude you then 

that you be best sit down and see what you have get by your journey 

I have see a face as beautiful as heaven 

that be nothing a prisoner see the face of heaven itself when he look but out at the prisongate I will stand root a man be as good be hang so a meet a handsome hangman and a strong rope as be in love 

your reason for that 

marry this sir hang be end of all trouble and love the beginning nay further I think a lord can be save for he be of all religion 

your proof for that 

This he think with the atheist there be not God but his mistress with the infidel no heaven but her smile with the papist no purgatory but her frown and with the family of love hold it lawful to lie with she though she be another man wife 

so sir what follow 

serve man sir the master go in before his wife and the servingman follow his master 

sirrah forbear I must meditate 

as the usurer before he part with money meditate upon the assurance 

if Violetta presence have not quench 
the memory of all thing but herself 
I shall be more familiar with that fate 

I have leave my country to seek out my friend 

and I my country and my friend for love 

and in the search of he have lose myself 
in the strange region of a woman eye 

in love and in Archadea 

as much as heaven transcend the humble earth 
so tower her praise her face differ as far 
from other as a glow worm from a star 
she be a princess that my soul affect 

and rich 

half heir unto this dukedom 

and she be whole heir to the four moral virtue it be nothing when shall I see the time that man will love for virtue or a rich heir marry a poor wench without a portion never I think 

have not my friend Lisander 

what of i 

l  nt in Thrace 

we have never meet in love 
his syllable betray he I arrest you 

at who suit 

not at his tailor in any case for there be no great stitch to a young brother conscience than to pay for a suit of apparel when it be wear out 

Lisander or his ghost 

Demetrius 
or some illusive tenant in his shape 

unkind why do thou leave my company 

for that which make the amorous god leave heaven 
for love but why be Demetrius thus disguise 

for that which will make a jackanapes a monkey and he can get it a tail 

peace rogue 

why wag be thy master in love 

faith sir he have enter his action in Cupid court and mean to proceed in the suit it shall seem 

why do not take my counsel in thy choice 

because I fear a chide for doubt thy honourable thought will not have consent to my effeminate attempt I steal this secret course and manner of disguise as best help to access which it have beget now what access will bring forth I commit to unborn industry 

it can but be prosperous only the strict observance of our love hinder the passage of our hope 

Indeed that be not the least hindrance yet the duke himself and my quaint disguise have remove it out of my way who not only take i for a woman but have allow i for my love companion 

fortune deal kind with thou I be as far from access to my love as when I be in thrate 

Dametas be the oystershell that hold thy pearl our wit must fish for he 

Will the cod head bite 

like a old usurer at a young heir inheritance and I h'ate ready hook for he and he ere he come my plot be to prefer thou to his service 

prithee do and I will serve he in his right kind 

Dametas my love be you 

which madam I be as proud of 

as a malcontent of a change or a old lady of a new fashion 

to be round I have a suit to you in the behalf of this woodman 

to i sweet blossom though I be somewhat strict in my office I can be stony to lady fellow be thy petition draw 

petition 

your only way to move a suit by humble complain to your good worship oh it be most pathetic and indeed without money can do just nothing with authority 

Come hither stripling who son be thou 

I be not so wise a child as you take i for I never knew my father 

do not know thy father 

a common fault his better forget themselves when they grow rich then blame not he to forget his father 

what be his name 

if I may give credit to my mother they call he Menalchas who on his deathbed make i his heir with this charge to seek your worship service and give i this gold as a remembrance to purchase your favour 

gold he 

now do my master long more to finger that gold than a young girl marry to a old man do to run her husband ashore at cuckold haven 

well I can do for this fatherless youth 

as many executor and overseer have do cheat he of his portion and then turn he out of door beg 

but for I have the guardian ship of the prince I dare do nothing without the consent of the duke 

Come come sir your worship shall not refuse he 

well then I woe not but it be for your sake I assure you 

mean the gold 

what shall I call thy name 

Dorus an it like your worship 

ah good Dorus be a honest youth Dorus reverence your master and love yourself be sure to get under i and you shall lose nothing in my service madam the duke and duchess expect you at the hunt and await your come at Diana oak 

I will attend they present be a good servant Dorus 

it will be his own another day madam 

in the mean time let it be you to lead the way 

my service do attend you 

as the pursuivant do the prisoner for a double fee 

welcome slave to a slave a fair presage 
the hope of love sweeten love vassalage 

now and Dametas be the mettle he be stamp for a right villain 

and he be not hang he 

nay he deserve hang to if he be but will you trust he 

yes as far as I see he and he that trust he further my trust be he will be deceive 

indeed he that will prove false to his maker will be true to no man 

yes for the present time like a bawd to he that give most 

that be not for love 

yes of the money he that look for other love in this age this be the place his letter speak of and here he come himself 

why so lo now be the web of my hope upon the loom of perfection and in this quench of lash aminter and julio 
see and see not all mum you know your que 
the game your own if you can hunt it true 

Dametas be thy ear ever at a more musical banquet how the hound mouth like bell be tune one under another like a slothfulness the speed of the cry outrun my sense of hear 

cross over the forest to Diana oak my liege and there your grace advantage by the height of the ground shall not only at pleasure hear but be eyewitness of their musical contention 

thank good Dametas be thy direction our wife convoy 

where be his highness Dametas 

at Adonis bower madam where he expect your presence to see the flesh of a couple of spartan hound in the waste blood of the spend deer 

thank good Dametas my eye will not be good friend with my foot shall they not bring they to that kingly sport 

sweet lady to save you the expense of much breath which must be lay out in the purchase of the game I have provide you this stand from whence your eye may be commander of the sport such sport as you little dream of 

we be your love debtor kind Dametas 
as I love virtue I pity these poor beast 
these sylvan commoner to see what task 
our covetous forester impose upon they 
who not content with impost of their breath 
poor heart pursue they smile to their death 

it be the end of their creation madam 

So be the end of we to live in peace 
and not to tyrannize on harmless beast 
but forester like image set forth 
the tyranny of greatness without pity 
as they the deer so covetous wealth pursue

I warrant you sister a old lady in Lacedaemon teach i a preservative against that 

for the love of cherry what 

marry this it be still say she betwixt every cherry say she be sure to crack a stone say she

so have I to for this time but sister be it not a strange kind of servile liberty that we live in here in Archadea 

for all the world as Englishman keep their felon and Italian their wine we never stir abroad without our jailor 

and for what cause forsooth only to keep we from marriage 

sure it be either some high content or extreme discommodity that our father debar we of it

other who speech seem near akin to truth 
say it be a passion breed in the heat of youth 
some call it a sigh and some a amorous groan 
all differ in the definition 
but in the allow opinion of most 
it be never true have till it be lose 
but lie thus alone as maid do use 
methinks I dream as maid can hardly choose 
and in my dream methinks it be too much wrong 
a pretty maid shall lie alone so long 
with that a gallant come gallant can do 
much with young maid 

and with old woman to 

he court i once and again and thrice 
it be virtue to say nay to be too nice

be you a reader then 

and a writer too bully I set some of my parishioner wife such copy as their husband may cast their cap at it but can never come near 

but and you use such a high and elevate style your auditory low and humble understanding shall never crawl over it 

tush I can fashion the body of my discourse fit to the ear of my auditor for to cast eloquence among a company of stinkard be all one as if a man shall scatter pearl among the hoggish animal clepe swine no I have paraphrastical admonition of all sort some against covetous landlord and that will I squirt among beggarly tenant some against usurer and that will I throw in at prison grate among prodigal banquet some against the pride of the court and that honey the ear of the citizen some against the fraud of the city and that be cake and cheese to the country some against protestant and that be plump the lazy catholic against papist and protestant and that fatten the rank witted Puritan against papist Puritan and protestant and that tickle the ear of the luxurious atheist 

why you never light upon any atheist do you 

o very many 

in the country perhaps and the outskirts of the city 

in the very bosom of the city and by your leave here and there one in the court too but we fi●t they all for in deed we wander light have as other tradesman have commodity of all sort and prize 

how do they come by they 

as many do by office steal into they ere the duke be aware of they 

some buy they at bookseller stall but the best they bespeak of poet 

methinks poet of all man shall not edify they be so envious 

one to another to nobody else a proud poet be for all the world like a punk in request covetous of many client when she have more than she can handsome play off you shall have some poet Apollo vicar especial write you a comical pastoral tragical musical history in prose will make the auditor eye run a water like so many waterspout I have one of they myself and your ear be in case I will give you a taste on it his argument be fetch out of the poem call the lose sheep and thus it be 

prithee be brief

a very sound reason for say he I come raw into the world and I will not willing go roast out so close up the stomach of your discourse with that dry answer and every man about his business 

you will be mindful of to morrownight 

as your lawyer of the term or your landlord of the quarter day 

why so the mettle I must forge my plot on lie a warm in the furnace of my brain and I must fashion it instant for fear it burst the heat give my conceit way for here come one must help to proportion it

if my Lisander hope prove like to this 
this night shall crown we monarcher of our bliss 

no more of these delay sweet madam your love have break day oft with my expectance I dare give it trust no long 

I confess it my liege and like a spend deer not able to maintain long flight I cast myself down breathless at your love mercy yet I beseech your majesty let not your eager desire practise any present violence upon my yield chastity it be only possession of my love you have in chase which with convenient time and place purchase I put your grace in full possession of 

although thy breath be never but musical yet it never teach the string of true happiness till now and to approve thy heart set hand to thy word appoint the time

by my imperial globe and hope of those joy thy presence shall bring to enrich i with I will meet thou and make thou queen over the most submiss captive that ever love take prisoner 

if you deceive i

and steed of morning when the sun shall rise 
they shall see two in my Zelmane eye 

so farewell think I I have prepare you a Zelmane answerable to your expectation 
then triumph in thy will and let thy thought 
proclaim a jubilee my teem hope 
be now deliver of a gracious birth 
which I have christen opportunity 
unto who shrine in honour of this day 
my thought shall hold a monthly sacrifice 
love grant Demetrius meet the like success 
our pain be crown with double happiness 

only our disguise hold firm but all other attempt meet untimely death even in their cradle 

what and we shall acquaint the lady with our intent 

it will argue a kind of cowardice in our wit that have such suspectless admittance to there presence as this disguise have purchase we we shall not have that ability of inventure to entangle they in their own security 

well howsoever we must not dwell long determine for the liberty of stay with Dametas who out of his covetous disposition in detain our reward allow we the old day of our license abode at court be run out 

it be very true and for my part I will rather go home with a private repulse then manage any unlikely attempt become sufferer under a public disgrace 

that be my very thought yet that our second arrival be not altogether empty of employment let we practise something upon Dametas and acquaint the world with his coward baseness in which he not only detract from his master bounty but look how as conduit head or masterspring that be poison do his best to infect the whole body of the court with the leprosy of his covetousness 

there be no action of his beget can be say to be true honourable 

how can they when there father be a mongrel the duke out of his honourable bounty command he to reward our travail with 200 crown and now after two month attendance and inforce delay in which time a ordinary petitioner may have spend the value of the reward he pack we off with 50 crown his excuse be that his master have forget we and what he do be of his own bounty as if the moon shall brag she give the world light when all the luster she have come from the heat of the sun 

shall his villainy be suffer to prosper they will grow to such height as the duke authority shall have much trouble to prune they 

to prevent which his majesty shall have private note of it know we in who trust to conduct it 

it be a office very few dare undertake he be so rivet to the duke good opinion 

lie there no jar betwixt none of the nobility and he what say you Zelmane 

the gallant Amazon you can not have cast your choice fit for her honourable mind maintain deadly feud against his base proceed and here she come attend by Dametas servant let we wait on opportunity

contend in courtesy who shall touch i first

that in the bosom of some foggy cloud 
I may embrace my love 

but night be purblind 
to make a duke a slave 

to make a duchess 
wrestle with amorous passion 

life a spleen 
can my rough breath like a tempestuous wind 
blow out heavens candle leave the world stark blind 
that it may either have no eye to see 
or use those eye it have to pleasure i
