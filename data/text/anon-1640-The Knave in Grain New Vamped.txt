be there such a time 

be there why have you forget how you kick i and I creep under the table I will be swear this hip be as lame ever since as if I have the sciatica 

absurd and gross 

we must leave you signior

than a stockfish

at your service 
shall we expect you at the old house 

if you please 
have you hear the like 

these be ass so tedious 

they be kin to burr they will not off with shake 
now my Thomaso what I have to say 
the chief occasion make i summon you 
be to entreat your knowledge and assistance 
in such a project as yourself set by and he that must 
partake in the attempt Venice in Italy 
conceal the man that I dare credit 

let it not touch confusion of the state 
treason and murder whatsoever it be 
command my will and sufferance 

defend that ever I shall be such 
Vallentius never have so foul a thought 
to infect himself and other 
thus in brief I love a woman fair 
than herself never wear the epithet 
you have see her sure and know she 
she be wife to Vanderman 

correma daughter 

that same only wight be the most precious 
beauty I adore and will fain call my own 

know you her husband 

by his name no further 
by that knowledge you understand his course 

yes he be a physician and beside 
what else report speak of he 

listen then my purpose 
the severe sir who high stretch phrase 
gall the ear of patience and wisdom will fain shun 
bear such a jealous and observant eye 
over the prey I aim at all conference be debar 
and you may soon whisper with the saint 
Argos have charge of than converse with she 
unseen and unsuspected 

be there no device to compass she 

but one and this be it 
yourself and Lodowick harken I beseech you 
shall to this skilful Vanderman present i 
as one distract nay smile anon 
and with a kind of sober modesty as if you list you can 
report some probable possibility how 
and which way I get my ecstasy

and so possess my prate mountebank 
that he shall say and swear I be mad at least 
if not past all recovery 

will this do 

This or none

why this be the shallow indirect course to win a woman that ever be compose in my opinion 

in your opinion why sir 

why hope you to gain she thus with a mad fit mark the event this be a course as wide be you so simple to imagine she a timorous woman will endure your presence seem possess for shame believe it not invent some other mean 

I very think so too but he will never be persuade 

this be a way to scare she and to make she shun you 

leave it off leave it off and study some other new passage 

do do this be the gross fie Vallentius 

Come you shall pardon he once we all miss sometime

immanly more dire austerity 
throw his breathless trunk 
in some obscure nightshaded mansion 
a prey for ravenous beast 
where never eye of creature rational 
shall more behold he unchristian part 
if there be justice above or here 
as certain there be both I will petition 
my loud complaint shall pierce both side of the globe 
and strike a sorrow in the rude thing 
nature for man use mould 
o my Antonio my joy my life

call i your son and such appointment as a father

out of your charity you will take the pain 
to lay i in the grave I have prepare and with your hand 
your foot or any thing cast dust upon my body 
and spend a little ceremony 

more than this I will and more than I will speak 
Francisco wheresoever thou bide abide in quiet 
and have my pardon ever if thou be flee 
for any cause of i and I thy ruin prove 
defend it heaven be it not for trial of phemone love 
and promise constancy how soon will I renounce 
my habitation unclothe thy fear and set all even again 
Nothing maze nor drive i into that serious 
contemplation as whence his wrath shall proceed 
perchance Franciscus think i unfit to call he brother 
and his sudden rage proceed from advice 
if it be so for ever will I keep this shady bower 
and never hold companionship with man 
more than be present forget Arbaces ever 
call i his or that I be his son 
circle i safety what be these come here 
where never neighbour dwell 

calamity can not inflict so much as I can bear 
with patience do Franciscus imagine but the truth 
no lenity but all extreme that may 
attend i with their sharp violence 
if ever I break my vow this sorrow 
nor the behaviour I sustain be for my own endure 
witness you that know all secret it be for he 
I wish thrice better than myself 

yes and that Cornelia as sure as the black ouzel 
have a yellow mouth that whistle i awake

if heretofore there have be any doll 
any bold Beachum and any cutpurse Moll 
any bawd fat with wealth or with care meager 
that spend her time in garrison or leaguer

though some have be more grave scarce any great 
but gentleman what need we more repeat 
know that even in all trade there be cheat 
it be common both in buy and in sell 
in all commerce nay even in money tell 
it be frequent betwixt the pander and the whore 
we ourselves find it at the playhouse door 
and though for a example here I stand 
I be not all the cheater in the land 
some here not question know it but I vow 
they what they please I will cheat none of you 

we understand their humour 
and the cause of their distemper 
and have too long suffer such weed 
as these to flourish in our soil 
but now no long shall this earth of we 
like a kind mother lend her fruit increase 
to cherish those will eclipse her worth 
but those who aim and act be imitable 
crown with green garland and with bowl brim full 
music proclaim a general festival 
a jubilee of joy and mirth to all 
may love and truth never like comfort miss 
nor knave in grain escape a reward like this
