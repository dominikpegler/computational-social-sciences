boy give i the master key of all the door 
to bed again and leave i to myself 
be Richard come have four elector swear 
to make he keisar in despite of i 
why then Alphonsus it be time to wake 
no Englishman thou be too hot at hand 
too shallow brain to undermine my throne 
the spanish sun have purify my wit 
and dry up all gross humour in my head 
that I be sight as the king of bird 
and can discern thy deep Stratagem 
I be the lawful German emperor 
choose install by general consent 
and they may term i tyrant as they please 
I will be king and tyrant if I please 
for what be empire but a tyranny 
and none but child use it otherwise 
of seven elector four be fall away 
the other three I dare not great trust 
my wife be sister to my enemy 
and therefore wise to be deal withal 
but why do I except in special 
when this position must be general 
that no man live must be credit 
further than tend unto thy proper good 
but to the purpose of my silent walk 
within this chamber lie my secretary 
Lorenzo de cipres in who learned brain 
be all the compass of the world contain 
and as the ignorant and simple age 
of our forefather blind in their zeal 
receive dark answer from Apollo shrine 
and honour he as patron of their bliss 
so I not muffle in simplicity 
zealous indeed of nothing but my good 
have to the augur of my happiness 
to lay the ground of my ensue war 
he learn his wisdom not by flight of bird 
by pry into sacrifice beast 
by hare that cross the way by howl wolf 
by gaze on the starry element 
or vain imaginary calculation 
but from a settle wisdom in itself 
which teach to be void of passion 
to be religious as the ravenous wolf 
who love the lamb for hunger and for prey 
to threaten our inferior with our look 
to flatter our superior at our need 
to be a outward saint a inward devil 
these be the lecture that my master read 
this key command all chamber in the court 
now on a sudden will I try his wit 
I know my come be unlooked for 
nay sleep Lorenzo I will walk a while 
as nature in the frame of the world 
ordain there shall be nihil vacuum 
even so methinks his wisdom shall contrive 
that all his study shall be full of wit 
and every corner stuff with sentence 
what be this Plato Aristotle tush these be ordinary 
it seem this be a note but new write 

what be there thief within the emperor court 
villain thou die what make thou in my chamber 

how now Lorenzo will thou slay thy lord 

I do beseech your sacred majesty to pardon i 
I do not know your grace 

lie down Lorenzo I will sit by thou 
the air be sharp and pierce tremble not 
have it be any other but ourselves 
he must have be a villain and a thief 

alas my lord what mean your excellence 
to walk by night in these so dangerous time 

have I not reason now to walk and watch 
when I be compass with so many foe 
they ward they watch they cast and they conspire 
to win confederate prince to their aid 
and batter down the eagle from my crest 
o my Lorenzo if thou help i not 
the imperial crown be shake from my head 
and give from i unto a english earl 
thou know how all thing stand as well as we 
who be our enemy and who our friend 
who must be threaten and who dally with 
who win by word and who by force of arm 
for all the honour I have do to thou 
now speak and speak to purpose in the cause 
nay rest thy body labour with thy brain 
and of thy word myself will be the scribe 

why then my lord take paper pen and ink 
write first this maxim it shall do you good 

the fox be subtle but he want force 
the lion strong but scorn policy 
I will imitate Lysander in this point 
and where the lion hide be thin and scant 
I will firm patch it with the fox fall 
let it suffice I can be both in one 

2 a prince above all thing must seem devout but there be nothing so dangerous to his state as to regard his promise or his oath 

tush fear not i my promise be sound 
but he that trust they shall be sure to fail 

nay my good lord but that I know your majesty 
to be a ready quickwitted scholar 
I will bestow a comment on the text 
3 trust not a reconcile friend for good turn can blot out old grudge 

then must I watch the palatine of the Rhein 
I cause his father to be put to death 

your highness have as little cause to trust 
the dangerous mighty duke of Saxony 
you know you seek to banish he the land 
and as for Collen be not he the first 
that send for Richard into Germany 

what be thy opinion of the other four 

that Bohemia neither care for one nor other 
but hope this deadly strife between you twain 
will cast the imperial crown upon his head 
for trier and Brandenburg I think of they 
as simple man that wish the common good 
and as for Mentz I need not censure he 
Richard have chain he in a golden bond 
and save his life from ignominious death 

let it suffice Lorenzo that I know 
when churfurst Mentz be take prisoner 
by young victorious otho duke of Braunschweig 
that Richard earl of Cornwall do disburse 
the ransom of a king a million 
to save his life and ride he out of band 
that sum of gold do fill the Braunschweig bag 
but since myself have rain a golden shower 
of bright hungarian ducat and crusado 
into the private coffer of the bishop 
the english angel take their wing and flee 
my cross bless his coffer and plead for i 
his voice be i buy with ten tun of gold 
and at the meeting of the seven elector 
his princely doubledealing holiness 
will spoil the english emperor of hope 
but I refer these matter to the sequel 
proceed Lorenzo forward to the next 

I be glad your grace have deal so cunning 
with that victorious fickle mind prelate for in election his voice be first but to the next 
4 it be more safety for a prince to be fear than love 

love be a humour please he that love 
let i be hate so I please myself 
love be a humour mild and changeable 
but fear ere grave a reverence in the heart 

5 to keep a usurp crown a prince must swear forswear poison murder and commit all kind of villainy provide it be cunning keep from the eye of the world 

but my Lorenzo that be the hard point 
it be not for a prince to execute 
physician and apothecary must know 
and service fear or counselbreaking bribe 
will from a peasant in a hour extort 
enough to overthrow a monarchy 

therefore my lord set down this sixth and last article 
6 be always jealous of he that know your secret 
and therefore it behoove you credit few 
and when you grow into the least suspect 
with silent cunning must you cut they off 
as for example julio Lentulus 
a most renown neapolitan 
give i this box of poison it be not long 
but therewithal I send he to his grave 

and what be the special virtue of the same 

that it be twenty day before it work 

but what be this 

This a infection that kill sudden 
this but a toy to cast a man asleep 

how be drink 

no be smell unto 

then smell Lorenzo I do break thy sleep 
and for this time this lecture shall suffice 

what have you do my lord you have make i safe 
for stir hence these four and twenty hour 

I see this charm his sense sudden 
how now Lorenzo half asleep already 
Aeneas pilot by the god of dream 
be never lull into a sound trance 
and now Alphonsus overread thy note 
these be already at my finger end 
and lest the world shall find this little schedule 
thus will I rend the text and after this 
on my behaviour set so fair a gloss 
that man shall take i for a convertite 
but some may think I shall forget my part 
and have be over rash in rent it 
to put they out of doubt I study sure 
I will make a backward repetition 
in be jealous of my counsel keeper 
this be the poison that kill sudden 
so do thou unto julius Lentulus 
and blood with blood must be requite thus 
now be I safe and no man know my counsel 
churfurst of Mentz if now thou play thy part 
earn thy gold with cunning workmanship 
upon the bemish king ambition 
Richard shall shameful fail of his hope 
and I with triumph keep my empery 

churfurst and prince of the election 
since by the adverse fortune of our age 
the sacred and imperial majesty 
have be usurp by open tyranny 
we the seven pillar of the German empire 
to who successive it do belong 
to make election of our emperor 
be here assemble to unite a new 
unto her former strength and glorious type 
our half decline roman monarchy 
and in that hope I Henry king of Bohemia 
churfurst and sewer to the emperor 
do take my seat next to the sacred throne 

next seat belong to julius Florius 
archbishop of Mentz chancellor of Germany 
by birth the duke of fruitful Pomerland 

the next place in election long to i 
George Cassimirus palsgrave of the Rhein 
his highness taster and upon my knee 
I vow a pure sincere innate zeal 
unto my country and no wrest hate 
or private love shall blind my intellect 

brave duke of saxon Dutchland great hope 
stir now or never let the spanish tyrant 
that have dishonour we murder our friend 
and stain this seat with blood of innocent 
at last be chastise with the saxon sword 
and may Albertus archbishop of Collen 
chancellor of Gallia and the four elector 
be think unworthy of his place and birth 
but he assist thou to his utmost power 

wisdom not word must be the sovereign salve 
to search and heal these grievous fester wound 
and in that hope Augustus duke of saxon 
archmarshal to the emperor take my place 

the like do Frederick archbishop of trier 
duke of Lorraine chancellor of Italy 

the seven and last be joachim Carolus 
marquis of Brandenburg overwear with age 
who office be to be the treasurer 
but war have make the coffer like the chair 
peace bring plenty war bring poverty 
grant heaven this meeting may be to effect 
establish peace and cut off tyranny 

pardon my bold intrusion mighty Churfurst 
and let my word pierce deep in your heart 
o I beseech you on my bend knee 
I the poor miserable empress 
a stranger in this land unused to broil 
wife to the one and sister to the other 
that be competitor for sovereignty 
all that I pray be make a quiet end 
make peace between my husband and my brother 
o think how grief do stand on either side 
if either party chance to be miss 
my husband be my husband but my brother 
my heart do melt to think he shall miscarry 
my brother be my brother but my husband 
oh how my joint do shake fear his wrong 
if both shall die in these uncertain broil 
o i why do I live to think upon it 
bear with my interrupt speech lord 
tear stop my voice your wisdom know my meaning 
alas I know my brother Richard heart 
affect not empire he will rather choose 
to make return again to Palestine 
and be a scourge unto the infidel 
as for my lord he be impatient 
the more my grief the lesser be my hope 
yet prince thus he send you word by i 
he will submit himself to your award 
and labour to amend what be amiss 
all I have say or can device to say 
be few word of great worth make unity 

madam that we have suffer you to kneel so long 
agree not with your dignity nor we 
thus we excuse it when we once be set 
in solemn council of election 
we may not rise till somewhat be conclude 
so much for that touch your earnest sure 
your majesty do know how it concern we 
comfort yourself as we do hope the best 
but tell we madam where be your husband now 

I leave he at his prayer good my lord 

at prayer madam that be a miracle 

undoubted your highness do mistake 
it be sure some book of conjuration 
I think he never say prayer in his life 

ah i my fear I fear will take effect 
your hate to he and love unto my brother 
will break my heart and spoil the imperial peace 

my lord of saxon and prince palatine 
this hard opinion yet be more than needs 
but gracious madam leave we to ourselves 

I go and heaven that hold the heart of king 
direct your counsel unto unity 

now to the depth of that we have in hand 
this be the question whether the king of Spain 
shall still continue in the royal throne 
or yield it up unto Plantagenet 
or we proceed unto a three election 

ere such a viperous bloodthirsty Spaniard 
shall suck the heart of our nobility 
the imperial sword which Saxony do bear 
shall be unsheathe to war against the world 

my hate be more than word can testify 
slave as he be he murder my father 

prince Richard be the champion of the world 
learned and mild fit for the government 

and what have we to do with Englishman 
they be divide from our continent 
but now that we may orderly proceed 
to our high office of election 
to you my lord of Mentz it do belong 
have first voice in this imperial synod 
to name a worthy man for emperor 

it may be think most grave and reverend prince 
that in respect of diverse sum of gold 
which Richard of mere charitable love 
not as a bribe but as a deed of alm 
disburse for i unto the duke of Braunschweig 
that I dare name no other man but he 
or shall I nominate another prince 
upon the contrary I may be think 
a most ingrateful wretch unto my friend 
but private cause must yield to public good 
therefore methinks it be the fit course 
to choose the worthy upon this bench 

we be all german why shall we be yoke 
either by Englishman or Spaniard 

the earl of Cornwall by a full consent 
be send for out of England 

though he be 
our late thought be pure than our first 
and to conclude I think this end be best 
since we have once choose he emperor 
that some great prince of wisdom and of power 
who countenance may overbear his pride 
be join in equal government with Alphonsus 

your holiness have sound in few word 
set down a mean to quiet all these broil 

so may we hope for peace if he amend 
but shall prince Richard then be join with he 

why shall your highness ask that question 
as if a prince of so high kingly birth 
will live in couple with so base a cur 

prince palatine such word do ill become thou 

he say but right and call dog a dog 

his birth be princely 

his manner villainous 
and virtuous Richard scorn so base a yoke 

my lord of saxon give i leave to tell you 
ambition blind your judgement in this case 
you hope if by your mean Richard be emperor 
he in requital of so great advancement 
will make the longdesired marriage up 
between the prince of England and your sister 
and to that end Edward the prince of Wales 
have bear his uncle company to Germany 

why king of Bohemia be it unknown to thou 
how oft the saxon son have marry queen 
and daughter king yea mighty emperor 
if Edward like her beauty and behaviour 
he will make no question of her princely birth 
but let that pass I say as erst I say 
that virtuous Richard scorn so base a yoke 

if Richard scorn some one upon this bench 
who power may overbear Alphonsus pride 
be to be name what think you my lord 

I think it be a mighty mass of gold 
that make your grace of this opinion 

my lord of Saxony you wrong i much 
and know I high scorn to take a bribe 

I think you scorn indeed to have it know 
but to the purpose if it must be so 
who be the fit man to join with he 

first with a ox to plough will I be yoke 

the fit be your grace in my opinion 

I be content to stay these mutiny 
to take upon i what you do impose 

why here be a tempest quick overblow 
God give you joy my lord of half the empire 
for i I will not meddle in the matter 
but warn your majesty to have a care 
and vigilant respect unto your person 
I will hie i home to fortify my town 
not to offend but to defend myself 

have with you cousin and adieu my lord 
I be afraid this sudden knit peace 
will turn unto a tedious last war 
only thus much we do request you all 
deal honourable with the earl of Cornwall 
and so adieu 

I like not this strange farewell of the duke 

in all election some be malcontent 
it do concern we now with speed to know 
how the competitor will like of this 
and therefore you my lord archbishop of trier 
impart this order of arbitrament 
unto the emperor bid he be content 
to stand content with half or lose the whole 
my lord of Mentz go you unto prince Richard 
and tell he flat here be no crown nor empire 
for english islander tell he it be he best 
to hie he home to help the king his brother 
against the earl of Leicester and the baron 

my lord of Mentz sweet word will qualify 
when bitter term will add unto his rage 
it be no small hope that have deceive the duke 
therefore be mild I know a Englishman 
be flatter be a lamb threaten a lion 
tell he his charge what so ever they be 
shall be repay with treble vantage 
do this we will expect their resolution 

brother of Collen I entreat your grace 
to take this charge upon you in my stead 
for why I shame to look he in the face 

your holiness shall pardon i in this 
have I the profit I will take the pain 
with shame enough your grace may bring the message 

thus be I wrong God know unguilty 

then arm your countenance with innocency 
and bold do the message to the prince 
for no man else will be the messenger 

why then I must since there be no remedy 

if heaven that guide the heart of mighty man 
do calm the wind of these great potentate 
and make they like of this arbitrament 
sweet peace will triumph through Christendom 
and Germany shall bless this happy day 

o i most miserable o my dear father 

what mean this passionate accent what be thou 
that sound these acclamation in our ear

and I poor I be comfort in nothing 
but that the emperor lament with i

and make i mad to see his majesty 
excruciate himself with endless sorrow 

the happy news that ever I do hear 
thy father be a villain murderer 
witty not wise love like a scorpion 
grow rich by the impoverish of other 
the chief cause of all these mutiny 
and Caesar tutor to all villainy 

none but a open liar term he so

Dutchland be bless in Lorenzo death 

do never live a vile mind man 

nor king nor churfurst shall be privilege 
to call i boy and rail upon my father

a man must be a boy at 40 year 
and dare not draw his weapon at a dog 
till be sound box about the ear

the time will come I shall be make a man 
till then I will pine with thought of dire revenge 
and live in hell until I take revenge 

behold here come the prince hand in hand

we do admire your wisdom in this cause 
and do accept the king of Bohemia 
as worthy partner in the government 
alas my lord I flat now confess

and hope to make you all admire the course 
that we intend in this conjunction

nor be I yet so young or fond withal 
causeless to spend my gall and fret my heart 
it be not that he be dead for all must die 
but that I live to hear his life reproach 
o sacred emperor these ear have hear 
what no son ear can unrevenged hear 
the prince all of they but special 
the prince elector archbishop of Collen 
revile he by the name of murderer 
arch villain robber of the empire fame 
and Caesar tutor in all wickedness 
and with a general voice applause his death 
as for a special good to Christendom 

have they not reason to applaud the deed 
which they themselves have plot ah my boy 
thou be too young to dive into their drift 

yet old enough I hope to be revenge 

what will thou do or whither will thou run 

headlong to bring they death then die myself 

first hear the reason why I do mistrust they 

they have no reason for my father death 
and I scorn reason till they all be dead 

thou will not scorn my counsel in revenge 

my rage admit no counsel but revenge 

first let i tell thou who I do mistrust 

your highness say you do mistrust they all 

yea Alexander all of they and more than all 
my most especial near dear friend 

all be one to i for know thou emperor 
be it thy father brother or thy empress 
yea be it thyself that do conspire his death 
this fatal hand shall take away thy life 

speak like a son worthy so dear a father 
be still and hearken I will tell thou all 
the duke of saxon 

o I think no less 

suppress thy choler harken to the rest 
Saxon I say so wrought with flatter Mentz 
Mentz with Bohemia trier and Brandenburg 
for Collen and the palsgrave of the Rhein 
be principal with saxon in the plot 
that in a general meet to that purpose 
the seven select emperor elector 
most heinous conclude of the murder 
the reason why they doom he unto death 
be his deep wisdom and sound policy 
know while he do live my state be firm 
he be dead my hope must die with he 
now Alexander will we be revenge 
upon this wicked whore of Babylon 
this hideous monster with the sevenfold head 
we must with cunning level at the heart 
with pierce and perish all the body die 
or strike we off her head by one and one 
behoove we to use dexterity 
lest she do trample we under her foot 
and triumph in our honour overthrow 

mad and amaze to hear this tragic doom 
I do subscribe unto your sound advice 

then hear the rest these seven give but she sentence 
a near hand put it in execution 
and but I love Lorenzo as my life 
I never will betray my dear wife 

what what the empress accessary to 

what can kindred do her brother Richard 
hope thereby to be a emperor 
give she a dram that send he to his grave 

o my poor father be thou such a eyesore 
that 9 the great prince of the earth 
must be confederate in thy tragedy 
but why do I respect their mightiness 
who do not once respect my father life 
your majesty may take it as you please 
I will be revenge upon your emperess 
on english Richard saxon and the palsgrave 
on Bohemia Collen Mentz trier and Brandenburg 
if that the pope of Rome himself be one 
in this confederacy undaunted I 
amid the college of his cardinal 
will press and stab he in St Peter chair 
though clad in all his pontificalibus 

why Alexander do thou speak to i 
as if thou do mistrust my forwardness 
no thou shall know my love to he be such 
and in my heart I have proscribe they all 
that have to do in this conspiracy 
the band of wedlock shall not serve she turn 
her fatal lot be cast among the rest 
and to conclude my soul do live in hell 
till I have set my foot upon their neck 
that give this spur of sorrow to my heart 
but with advice it must be manage 
not with a headlong rage as thou intend 
nor in a moment can it be perform 
this work require long time dissemble look 
commix with undermine action 
watch advantage to execute 
our foe be mighty and their number great 
it therefore follow that our stratagem 
must branch forth into manifold deceit 
endless device bottomless conclusion 

what by your majesty be prescribe to i 
that will I execute or die the death 
I be content to suck my sorrow up 
and with dull patience will attend the time 
gape for every opportunity 
that may present the least occasion 
although each minute multiply my anguish 
and to my view present a thousand form 
of senseless body in my father shape 
yell with open throat for just revenge 

content thyself he shall not cry in vain 
I have already plot Richard death 

that have my father sacred ghost inspire 
oh tell i shall I stab he sudden 
the time seem long till I be set awork 

thou know in gripe at our lot today 
it be prince Richard hap to be the bower 
so that his office be to drive the cart 
and bring a load of wood into the kitchen 

o excellent your grace be forester 
as in the thicket he do load the cart 
may shoot he dead as if he be a deer 

no Alexander that device be shallow 
thus it must be there be two very hour 
appoint for to help he in the wood 
these must be bribe or cunning seduce 
instead of help he to murder he 

verbum satis sapienti it be enough 
fortune have make i marshal of the sport 
I hope to marshal they to the devil feast 
plot you the rest this will I execute 
dutch bower as thousand schelm and gold to tempt they 

it be right about it then but cunning 

else let i lose that good opinion 
which by your highness I desire to hold 
by letter which I will strew within the wood 
I will undermine the bower to murder he 
nor shall they know who set they so awork 
like a familiar will I fly about 
and nimble haunt their ghost in every nook 

this one nail help to drive the other out 
I slay the father and bewitch the son 
with power of word to be the instrument 
to rid my foe with danger of his life 
how easy can subtle age entice 
such credulous young novice to their death 
huge wonder will Alphonsus bring to pass 
by the mad mind of this enrage boy 
even they which think themselves my great friend 
shall fall by this deceit yea my archenemy 
shall turn to be my chief confederate 
my solitary walk may breed suspect 
I will therefore give myself to company 
as I intend nothing out these sport 
yet hope to send most actor in this pageant 
to revel it with Rhadamant in hell 

how far be Richard now unlike the man 
the cross the sea to win a empery 
but as I plod it like a plump bower 
to fetch in fuel for the kitchen fire 
so every one in his vocation 
labour to make the pastime plausible 
my nephew Edward jet it through the court 
with princess Hedewick empress of his fortune 
the demi Caesar in his hunter suit 
make all the court to ring with horn and hound 
Collen the cook bestir he in the kitchen 
but that which joy i most in all these sport 
be Mentz to see how he be make a ass 
the common scorn and byword of the court 
and every one to be the same he seem 
seem to forget to be the same he be 
yet to my robe I can suit my mind 
nor with my habit shake dishonour off 
the seven elector promise i the empire 
the perjure bishop Mentz do swear no less 
yet I have see it share before my face 
while my best friend do hide their head for shame 
I bear a show of outward full content 
but grief thereof have almost kill my heart 
here rest thou Richard think upon a mean 
to end thy life or to repair thy honour 
and vow never to see fair England bound 
till thou in Aix be crown emperor 
holla methinks there come company 
the bower I trow that come to hew the wood 
which I must carry to the kitchen fire 
I will lie a while and listen to their talk

in saxon land you know it be the use 
that the first night the bridegroom spare the bride

though saxon will not suffer he to taste 
the deadly potion provide for he

who dire effect have gaul your princely heart 
confound your conceit muffle your eye 
first to begin this villainous fiend of hell 
murder my father sleep in his chair 
the reason why because he only know 
all plot and complot of his villainy 
his death be make the basis and the ground 
of every mischief that have trouble you 

if thou thy father and thy progeny 
be hang and burn and break on the wheel 
how can their death heap mischief on our head 

and if you will not hear the reason choose 
I tell thou I have slay a emperor 
and thereby think myself as good a man 
as thou or any man in Christendom

since you entreat i then I will proceed 
this murderous devil have slay my father 
buzz cunning into my credulous ear 
that by a general council of the state 
and as it be by act of parliament 
the seven elector have set down his death 
and make the empress executioner 
transfer all the guilt from he to you 
this I believe and first do set upon 
the life of princely Richard by the boor 
but how my purpose fail in that his grace best know 
next by a double intricate deceit 
midst all his mirth be Bohemia poison 
and good old Mentz to save Alphonso life 
who at that instant be in perfect health 
betwixt jest and earnest be make a sacrifice 
as for the palatine your grace know 
his highness and the queen unguiltiness 
but now my lord of saxon hark to i 
father of saxon shall I rather call you

create in a most unlucky hour 
to a most violent and untimely death

oh guiltless prince oh i most miserable 

but tell we who reveal to thou at last 
this shameful guilt and our unguiltiness 

why that be the wonder lord and thus it be 
when like a tyrant he have take his seat 
and that the fury of the fight begin 
upon the high watchtower of the fort 
it be my office to behold aloft 
the war event and have see the end 
I see how victory with equal wing 
hang hover betwixt the battle here and there 
till at the last the english lion flee 
and saxon side obtain the victory 
which see I post from the turret top 
more furious than ere Laocoon run 
when trojan hand draw in Troy overthrow 
but yet as fatal as he or any 
the tyrant see i stare in my face 
and sudden demand what be the news 
ay as the fate will have it hope that he 
even in a twinkle will have slay they both 
for so he swear before the fight begin 
cry bitter that he have lose the day 
the sound whereof do kill his dastard heart 
and make the villain desperate confess 
the murder of my father pray i 
with dire revenge to ride he of his life 
short tale to make I bind he cunning 
tell he of the deceit triumph over he 
and last with my rapier slay he dead 

o heaven just have you take revenge 
but thou thou murderous adulterous slave 
what bull of Phalaris what strange device 
shall we invent to take away thy life 

if Edward and the empress who I save 
will not requite it now and save my life 
then let i die content I die 
have at last revenge my father death 

villain not all the world shall save thy life 

have thou not be author of my Hedewick death 
I will have certain save thou from death 
but if my sentence now may take effect 
I will adjudge the villain to be hang 
as here the Jew be hang in Germany 

young prince it shall be so go drag the slave 
unto the place of execution 
there let the judas on a jewish gallow 
hang by the heel between two english mastiff 
there feed on dog let dog there feed on thou 
and by all mean prolong his misery 

o may thyself and all these english cur 
instead of mastiffdog hang by my side 
how sweet will I tug upon your flesh 

away with he suffer he not to speak 
and now my lord Collen Tryer and Brandenburg 
who heart be bruise to think upon these woe 
though no man have such reason as myself

after so many bloody massacre 
kneel upon our knee humble entreat 
your excellence to be our emperor
