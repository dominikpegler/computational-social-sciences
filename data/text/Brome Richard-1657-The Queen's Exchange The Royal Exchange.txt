of marriage not only to enable i 
in my government but thereby to strengthen 
this kingdom in succeed time by a line 
of lawful successor I give you all 
my strong and most unanswerable reason 
to which you seem content all but one 
who with the rest by this I hope be satisfy 
it be you lord Segebert you it be I mean 
do it appear to you yet reasonable 
that I be match to the Northumbrian king 
I have with patience wait a whole month 
for you to rectify your scrupulous judgement 
whereby it may comply with these no way 
inferior to yourself but be your peer 
as well in their know wisdom as my favour

to weigh with your know wisdom the great danger 
this match may bring unto the crown and country 
it be true the king Osrick as well in person 
as in his dignity may be think fit 
to be endow with all you seem to yield he 
but what become of all the wholesome law 
custom and all the nerve of government 
your no less prudent than majestic father 
with power and policy enrich this land with 
and make the saxon happy and yourself 
a queen of so great eminence must all 
with so much majesty and matchless beauty 
be now subject to a stranger foot 
and tread into disorder all your wealth 
your state your law your subject and the hope 
of flourish future fortune which your father 
by his continual care and tedious study 
give as a legacy unto this kingdom 
must all be alter or quite subvert 
and all by a wilful gift unto a stranger 

peace stop his mouth unreverent old man 
how dare thou thus oppose thy sovereign will 
so well approve by all thy fellow peer 
of which the mean equal thou in judgement 

do you approve their judgment madam which 
be ground on your will I may not do it 
only I pray that you may understand 
but not unto your loss the difference 
betwixt smooth flattery and honest judgement 

do you hear this my lord 

my lord Segebert 
though you except against this king 
he may hereafter thank you in your kind 

mean time I thank you for your pprophecy 

you can but allow succession be 
the life of kingdom and if so you can 
but wish the queen which heaven grant speedy 
a happy husband 

I thank you good my lord 

and if a husband why not he she affect 
can it befit a subject to control 
the affection of his princess heaven forbid 

this be ear take music 

or suppose 
you may control it who in your great wisdom 
will you allot the queen 

I see your aim 
and know when I have say all that I dare 
what censure I must undergo and thus 
I will meet it bold you be sycophant all 
and do provide but for yourselves though all 
the kingdom perish for it May the justice 
that follow flattery overtake you for it 

take hence the mad man 

we be sorry for you 

and wish the troublesome spirit be out of you 
that so distract your reason 

we have know you 
speak and answer to the purpose 

your question to no purpose sir be this 
who my great wisdom will allot the queen 
you be not worth my answer but my sovereign 
I do implore your gracious attention 
to these few word 

less sense 

no matter 

silence 
speak your few word the queen can give you hear 

I wish your highness will command your woman 
that know their quality to take up your beagle 
their petulance sort not with this place 
nor the more serious matter of my speech 

speak I can hear you though forbear he lord 

the king your father and my never to be 
forget master please you to remember 
although his memory be lose with these 
who never have grace to know he right give i 
before his death strict this charge and in 
your presence too charge yourself withal 
to give it due obedience that you shall 
before all man advice take i for marriage 
and that especial I shall take care 
against innovation that the law he leave 
establish with such care for good of the kingdom 
may be maintain by whosoever you match with 
I know and you if you know any thing 
may know the difference betwixt the Northumbrian law 
and we and soon will their king pervert 
your privilege and your government 
then reduce he to you pure common sense 
even you methinks my lord may foretell that 

you have say enough 

I do beseech your highness 
but for this little more 

I will hear no more 

pray hear his little more although you send he 
out of your hear then for evermore 

your father add this to his command 
that rather then by marriage you shall bring 
your subject to such thraldom and that if 
no prince who law cohere with you do seek you 
as some there be and near than the northumbrian 
that he will have you from some noble stock 
to take a subject in your own dominion 

traitor 

to urge your father testament 

but do the king your never forget master 
bequeath she a affection to such blood 

forbear now he be not worth your speak to 

now she will have i I hope what a foul beast 
be I to undervalue subject blood 

I have forbear you long for the old love 
my father in his life confer upon you 
and still I yield to it so much as save 
your head bold talk fellow but sir hear 
your doom since the king love have puff your dotage 
with swell conceit for what can it be less 
that you be now my king for sure you think so 
I will try my title with you hence you exile

speak not a word for he 

insooth we mean it not 

but may it please your majesty you mention 
his head erewhile now if I may advise 

a way you will be too cruel 

another hope lose 

his land and good madam will be think on 

no he have child 

I will take his daughter with all fault and half his land 

why be you not go 

I have not much to say 

out with it then and then out with yourself 

in the large history of your father life 
you find but one example for this doom 
of banishment and that be of Albert five year since 
for wrong i unto his highness when 
he stand in competition with i for 
the honour in the state the king then give i 

and what of this 

but thus I stand by then and then all know heaven 
see that though he for wrong i be banish 
I be right sorry and much plead for he 

it follow now that you will have these lord 
who you have so abuse to plead for you 

quite contrary for they be my abuser 
yet I do grieve for they but more for you 
to think on all your sorrow when too late 
you will wish for i to steer the state

as dare oppose their prince purpose 
conduct in now the ambassador of Northumbria 
while I review his master bright figure exit Elkw Elf 
as ardent but with more pure affection 
as ere do Cynthia her Endymion Ent Emb 
my lord you have attend long but now 
I shall return that answer to your king 
that if his love be as you have pretend 
may well excuse your stay tell he this story

a never conquer city the siege be long 
and no report come back unto the king 
how well or ill his expedition thrive 
until his doubtful thought have give lose 
his hope of the city and his army both 
when he be full of this despair arrive 
of the sudden his brave general with victory 
which make his thank as be his conquest double 
you may interpret i my lord 

if so 
I be to tell the king he have win your love

betwixt he and we the prime man in her favour

as he shall please to consummate our marriage

and for your speed wear this 

most gracious queen

post every way that the three day from this 
the general joy may sound and shine through all

that be with bell and bonfire 

go 

and now my lord I must require your care 
to set down a fit order for our journey 
unto this queen to perfect my world bliss 
I will not fail in the least article 
of state or decency in this affair 
provide so that we may in all appear 
worthy the achievement of our fair ambition 
and let our follower be choose such 
who inward worth no less than outward show 
may make we glorious in this expedition 
do speedy and effectual good my lord 
the time haste on 

our duty shall prevent it 

methinks the silent picture seem to say 
it be fit I shall anticipate a day Ex lord 
rather than lose one minute from that light 
who very shadow be so angel bright 

but when your highness shall behold nay more 
shall touch nay more and near shall embrace 
nay more and near yet enfold and handle 
nay more and near of all enjoy 
the lively that be too little heavenly substance 
of this poor imaginary which be as short 
as far inferior to the life 
as a weak starlight to the mid day sun 

o do not ravish i with expectation 
this be a way to make each hour until 
I shall enjoy my bliss a tedious night 
each night a death yet can I not desire 
to shift the argument off our discourse 
do she appear so fair so lovely 

sir 
suppose you see a glorious firmament 
bedeck with heavenly star so shine her court 
with lady may be think of matchless beauty 
strike mere humane sight with admiration 
imagine now you see break through a veil 
amid those star though heavenly lesser beauty 
the bright Cynthia in her full of lustre 
so this no less to be compare queen 
shine above beauty to a humane eye 
that be not mix with powerful majesty 
you may behold she your divinity 
my king may comprehend what can befit 
i only to confess I do admire 

o thou be i in such a queen 
and such a servant never be king so bless 
but be there in her court although inferior 
to she more excellent such special beauty 
and in my Theodoric apprehension 
you have make choice of one then 

I have see 
one so agreeable to my affection 
above all the rest I can but confess 
I strive to be her servant 

doubtless then 
she be a fair one Theodrick never fear 
she be thy own myself will be thy spokesman 
if she be worthy of thou 

for fair virtue 
with all the grace which adorn the mind 
in best opinion she be unparalleled 
by any subject lady I must ever 
allow supremacy unto the queen 
and for her person it appear in all 
most answerable to her face of which here be 
the exact copy that I can get draw 
and without flattery by the queen own lymner 

pray let i see it Indeed it be a sweet one 
do he that draw this of the queen draw that 

with the same hand 

but not with the same colour 
trust i they be much unlike 
he wrong the queen 
and merit her displeasure even to death 
to advance a servant beauty above her own 

what say your majesty 

Keep off a little 
you stand just in my light and so he do 
betwixt i and the prime beauty of the world 
but I will be even with he and cause my picturer 
to set this crown upon this head and then 
fie what a fancy be this he will perceive i 
but now I note this forehead and this brow 
this eye this lip 

you have let fall the queen sir 

I cry her mercy what a shame it be 
that I shall fall in his discovery 
be court so fraught with fraud and flattery 
and can a king that govern such professor 
no whit dissemble to obscure his passion 
I must and thus begin to practice it 
Theodrick do thou note my contemplation 
over these picture 

I can but perceive 
your highness view they well and I have learn 
to make no search into my sovereign thought 

thou be ever modest thus it be Theodrick 
protest it rape i above the pitch of mortal 
first to consider what a absolute beauty 
this queen have in herself but then to gather 
the circumstance many such as this 
as thou affirm inferior light to she 
that shine about she render she more glorious 
light she above affection to a height 
that claim her adoration then marvel not 
that now when this but in effigy 
be but place by she by which her majesty 
so much the more appear I can not hold 
this figure of that all to be command beauty 
when my high thought be flee up to her presence 
now take thy piece of craftsmanship again 
which trust i be a pretty one while I 
devote my service to this deity 

sir you have give i the queen picture 

ha 
what a mistake be here but thou be honest 
and covet but thy own take it Theodrick 
now tell i of what house o parentage 
your mistress be 

I tell you first her virtue 
her person next and by this her beauty 
which you be please to deem not much amiss 

it be such Theodrick that have I not see 
this so much above it pardon my hypocrisy 
I shall have envy any man but thou 
in such a choice but speak her parentage 

that be all her blemish 

be she of taint blood 

you search with kingly wisdom she be daughter 
to that hold obstinate baron I inform you of 
who the queen in her just displeasure banish 

thy love to she may hereafter plead for he 
but soft I be not well 

heaven bless the king 
who wait within there 

tarry let i see 
that picture once again it want exceed 
of this in many thing 

I shall want judgement 
not to grant that 

here it want palpable 
the droop of the brow and here again 
the dulness of the eye which here show deadly 
but for a little squint it have good queen 
you look asquint then look you sir you want 
you shall not hear i neither cause I will not 
spoil your conceit of it your lady want 
the furious sharpness of the nose which here 
my queen have very shrewd and again

which the best physiognomist do tell we 
show woman apt to lust and strong incontinence 
phew this be all too sweet for mortal sense 
here take it again and keep i for i with it 
lay they together the one may mend the other

and in the clear I see offa falsehood may 
in both my blood run forth apace o 
my thick blood Anthynu be forgive by thou 
and the clear cleanse my offa treachery 
o 

do thou not heat a groan a die groan 

not I sir I hear nothing

here sir here be something that perhaps have groan 
but it be out of hear now 

and so be pity among man ay i a old man

and yet he hold a sword 

So more work still 
while we be gather simple to cure one

scold wife that have be 9 day in the grave

in this so harmless habit 

good master let it warn you though we have hitherto 
pass by these mantiger these wolvish outlaw safe early and late as not 
worth their malice yet pray sir now since they 
begin to kill man of this coat and these year let we 
forsake this savage habitation and live 
in the world of meat again 

how ill be these white hair bestain with red 
methinks I shall have know this face nothing to wipe 
the blood off come help away with he 

he be help away and make away enough already methinks 

why do not lift 

sure they have blow their sin into he that kill he 
he be so heavy he be deadly heavy pray sir let i 
fetch my grave instrument and your book and bestow he here 
you will not bury he in your cave I be sure 

I say I will have he down perhaps the wound 
man that be there may know he 

I will I have but this fellow weight in buttock beef 

I come my father chide not now my stay 
in which I be more tardy I confess 
then ere I be in duty I have bring you 
where be you sir ha this be sure the place 
and this the very oak at which I leave he 
I mark it careful and take due heed 
even to the number of my step in my 
departure how to make my back return 
nor be my tarriance such that in that space 
he can recover strength to shift his ground 
I wish it be so well with he my lord 
my father what a mist of doubt stand I 
amaze in and my unspeakable amazement 
be such that I begin to call my sight 
and memory in question whither this place 
or whether he or I or any thing 
be or be not good sense do not leave i 
my search will be in vain if you forsake i 
father my lord where be you how or where 

here 

that be well say speak on 
now where 

now here 

now here where be that here 

here 

I hear and follow but I know not where 

here 

at the same place again 
if there be place or I know any thing 
how be my willingness in search delude 
it be the wood that ring with my complaint 
and mock echo make her merry with it 
curse be thy babble and may thou become 
a sport for wanton boy in thy fond answer 
or stay perhaps it be some gentle spirit 
hover in the air that see his flight to heaven 
and will direct i thither after he 
good reason leave i not but give i leave 
a little to consider near home 
say his divine part be take up 
to those celestial joy where blessed one 
find their inheritance of immortality 
I can think his earthly property 
so soon can find the passage to that height 
his body will be here poor martyr body 
that though it yet do live can not part hence 
without the help of other leg and hand 
and here haunt none but such who cruelty 
will toss he into further misery 
wild beast if here be any half so ravenous 
as those inhuman mankind monster be 
that draw his blood and these unusual tear 
can not devour he all some particle 
some remnant will be leave to bless a son with 
but here be none but that too sure a sign 
for i to know the place by where I leave he 
part of the blood I see run from he oh 
dear hallow blood inspire i with this kiss 
to find the fountain whence this stream do flow 
I will not eat nor sleep until I know 
no can thou tell i nothing then I will take 
a sample of the precious store be spill 
to keep i still in memory of the guilt 
and of my vow never to feed or rest 
until I find he here or with the bless 

I have not know nor read nor hear since I 
be of discretion to know any thing 
worthy a man capacity of the like 

you be well meet my lord 
and you as welcome to the court my lord although a sad one 

come you now from the king my lord 

Even now 

How leave you he good my lord 

as the physician 
I fear must short do not know what 
to say to he 

heaven bless the king be he 
so dangerous sick 

he be sick enough 
to be pray for my lord 
although I can proper call it 
a sickness I be sure it be a disease 
both to himself and all that come about he 
I fear he be braincracked lunatic and frantic mad 
and all the doctor almost as mad as he 
because they can find the cause something 
they guess afflict his mind but of what nature 
it be or how the strong conceit may grow 
they can by no mean win or wrest from he 
such be the obstinacy of his disease 

where be Theodrick then his bosom friend 
his special favourite he methinks may gain 
the knowledge of his inmost thought 

it be think 
he put these wild torment thought into he 
for which the king have banish he the court 
and with a guard upon his person send he 
to live confine at his house myself and all 
the faithful body of the state have move 
the king for his repeal again to favour 
Even we that for these two year space have wish he 
for good statereason favourless and headless 
have beg for his enlargement that the king 
may vent his trouble thought into his breast 
and so find way to ease but all in vain 
he will not hear of he 

you tell i wonder 
but good my lord how take the king his rest 

troth as mad mortal do we can tell 
whether he sleep at all or not sometime 
he seem to sleep but then his trouble thought 
express themselves in sigh in sudden start 
in groan and sometime speech of odd confuse 
and indigested matter then he leap 
from off his bed call for his horse and armour 
sword spear and battleaxe but anon 
bid all be let alone and call for book 
shoffel divinity and poetry 
philosophy and historical together sport 
and throw all by then call for merry 
which ever they be present he forbid 
with strong rebuke to all that spend their time 
in any exercise but contemplation 
in solitary place then walk forth 
into the grove and thicket charge those 
that follow he nor dare they disobey 
to keep aloof at such proportion distance 
as he unheard by all may vent his passion 
unto the air the wood the rock the spring 
and twice in these retirement have we lose he 
in those obscure meander which his melancholy 
have lead he to and when much industry 
and care have find he out it be double trouble 
to wind he and his fancy home again 

it be most pitiful 

now how do the king 

full now my lord of a new fancy he 
be now become pilgrim 

a pilgrim why 

I know not why nor to what shrine nor do 
I hold it fit to ask he but to give 
free way unto his fancy yet a while 
in all to please and play with his infirmity 
it be our best way to cool frenetic humour 
before we kill they sir 
his pilgrimage shall not be far though he pretend a long one 
he have on his weed already 
and who associate he 

only myself and his new fool he say 

good a fool and a physician 

a physician and a fool you will say the physician ever 
before the fool my lord 

and why the fool before my lord I pray 

your lordship pardon we must have no lord 
along with we though I be send to inquire 
if you lord Ethelswick be come to court 
who the king send for 

send the king for you 
after your long retirement in the country 

he do indeed my lord 

there be something in it then 
that savour not of madness altogether 
that have put by your antagonist 
the trouble of the court his favourite 
he send for you immediate upon it enter king Jeffrey Alfride and Edelbert 
here come our pilgrim king 

stand all apart 
to be complete arm from head to foot 
can advance the spirit of a king 
above the power of love nor to be clad 
in poor habit of humility 
can mortify the least of the desire 
that love inflame man with no outward dress 
can change or make affection more or less 
I have try all the way I can to conquer 
or to humiliate my rage passion 
which still grow more predominant over my reason 
I find it in myself and know my error 
though no mean to correct it I do know 
it be foul do to slight the queen that love i 
and it be a act no less unprincely 
to cast into suspense my friendly servant 
for what transgression be it in he to love 
one fair than my choice before he know 
my waver inconstancy I know 
withal my punishment be just however 
my suffering make i wish it less severe 
for my unjust remove of Theodrick 
I lose all helpful counsel all relief 
that my overburden break heart cry out for 
into his breast I can unload my grief 
be it compose of aught but his abuse 
I must not dare not trust he with this story 
lest for redress I meet revenge who be there 

my lord the king 

o you be welcome Ethelswick I be now 
to trust you in a serious affair 

my duty bind i to your highness service 

we will walk forth together Ethelswick 
let none presume to follow not a man 
give the least motion this way on your life 

not I neam king will thou not take i with thou 

pull the fool off i 

o but they shall not neam it be more than they 
can do 

no sir we will try 

again I charge you all that none presume 
to follow we 

all will thou leave all thy fool behind thou neam 

all fool sir shall be whip 

and where will you find wise man to whip they all 
we shall make whip one another short 
trust i a trim courtcomplement I be advance 
to high promotion be I not to wear long coat again 
and feed on whip cheer but hark you 
cousin lord do you reward fool at court 

yes fool if they deserve it 

and be desert reward here too 

yes 

then it be desert get whip and fool get reward 
I will not forsake the court for that yet where I hope to 
get enough to raise half my country 

by what project I pray thou 

by beg a monopoly cousin lord you know fool will 
always be beg they be natural incline to it 
else none will be courtier 

and what be your monopoly 

I hope the king will give it i if the lord that 
walk with he bring he in again as wise as 
he go out 

what be it thou will beg 

it be a monopoly of fool my lord that the king 
will carry no fool with he but of my election and 
by my allowance and that when he come 
back into his own country he bring no new 
one from thence but by the same authority 

and what price or fee will you set upon a fool head 
for his admittance 

accord to the degree or estate or quality of the fool 
cousin lord 

this be a covetous and a politic fool 

not so politic cousin lord as a statesman that pay his 
head for his learning nor so covetous as a churchwarden 
may be when I be dead and go but as I be 
a say I will use my fool accord to their quality 
or breed if he be a poor fool I will make he pay the more 
for it if he be rich I may be behold to he another way 
if he be a fool natural and poor bear he be 
sure to pay enough for it but if he have more breed 
than capacity and be a noble descend fool I will use he 
the better for your sake cousin lord and the rather because 
I hope you will further my suit to the king and so 
I will wait his come in at the back stair 

this be a precious fool 

the king will his infirmity give leave 
will be delight in he 

I be glad 
the king have choose one yet to impart 
I hope his grief unto 

but be it true 
the king send for lord Ethelswick to court 

now in his melancholy and so present 
on the remove of his love Theodrick 

it be most true in which we may observe 
a turn of state good Ethelswick be dear 
dear belove indeed by our late king 
and worthy deserve his royal favour 
but with his son our sovereign lord that be 
youthful Theodrick be prime man in grace 
and quick shoulder Ethelswick from court 
theodrick absence now resign new place 
for Ethelswick to reassume the grace 
thus the courtwheel go round like fortune ball 
one statesman rise on another fall 
let we wait the come of the king my lord 

we be for the wood to make a flight or two 
at the pheasant edelbert 

Alfride agree 

to fast and watch be duty and no penance 
when such affair as i be in pursuit 
How dare I think of meat or sleep which be 
such hindrance to a devotion 
who least neglect will pull down thunder on i 
and to take sense of weariness be a sin 
unpardonable but to have lose 3 day 
and tedious night in painful diligence 
in such a search as this for such a father 
and now to lose the hope of find he 
be torment unexpressible where which way 
shall I make further inquisition 
yes I will on to the Northumbrian court 
and make my grief appear unto the king 
my wander step have almost lead i now 
unto his court where if I may find grace 
nay but humanity I shall prevail 
to have these wood the den of barbarous outlaw 
in which I lose my father strict search recorder 
ha do I hear or dream be this a sound 
or be it but my fancy it be the music 
the music of the sphere that do applaud 
my purpose of proceed to the king 
I will on but stay how what a strange benumbedness 
assail and seize my exterior part 
and what a chaos of confuse thought 
do my imagination labour with 
till all have wrought themselves into a lump 
of heaviness that fall upon my eye 
so ponderous that it bow down my head 
begin to curb the motion of my tongue 
and lay such weight of dulness on my sense 
that my weak knee be double under i 
there be some charm upon i Come thou forth 
thou sacred relic sudden dissolve it 
I sleep with deathless for if thus I fall 
my vow fall on i and smite i into ruin 
but who can stand against the power of fate 
though we foreknow repentance come too late 

be I among the dead or in what region 
either of earth or air heaven hell or whither 
or into what be I translate be I 
alive or dead awake asleep a man 
or airy ghost or do I see or dream 
if now I be awake and be Anthynus 
that grieve Anthynus who have lose a 
then do I see in apparition 
the ghost of our 6 last west saxon father king 
as each succeed other now pass by i 
of which the last kenwalcus our late king 
and father to the tyranness that banish 
i seem to take i up to his succession 
it be more idle than a dream can be 
for i awake to think it possible 
I shall become a king and of that land 
from which my father be exile it must 
be then a dream as I have hear of man 
that sleep stand nay walk and talk as I do 
at least as I suppose now if I sleep 
not have see my father I have break 
my vow I will rather think i dead then why 
be I not bless with my dead father sight 
why be not he with king kenwalcus now 
that live love he so o my wild thought 
you be become a whirlwind in my brain 
lift i up to hurl i down again 

go carry home your hawk they be as good 
as ere make flight 

I will the king have see 
his melancholy set apart our princely sport 

I hope my good lord Ethelswick by this time 
have take the burden of his discontent 
the cause of his strong malady from his mind 

I rather think the king have lose he too 
among the bush as he do we last night 

it be a strange humour in a king and as 
unheard of a disease that work it in he 
to hide himself in bywalk cave and thicket 

we shall search hollow tree and crow nest short 
for he if these fit hold he 

bless we look here 
be not this he a witch can not guess right 
than thou have do old Ethelswick have lose he 
and here be the king asleep 

this be the habit 
the pilgrim weed he go in have he not 
end his pilgrimage here be he not dead 

no he be warm and breathe like health itself 

it be so my lord I vow he sleep as if 
all the seven sleeper have take up their lodging 
in his fantastic brainpan 

he have not sleep 
we know these four night 

Hear you my lord the king

I will undertake a drum or a whole kennel 
of scold can wake he

I do conceive you for we will take he home 
and have he put in bed before he wake 
if it be possible up with he and there 
when he have sleep it out he will perhaps 
be cure and give we answerable thank 
if not and that he be offend for 
the breach of his command in come near he 
he shall never know who do it 

be it so 

away then soft soft so so soft

by which I find much ease and hope to sleep

or the construction of man rude manner 
may cast upon we

they mock i with the title of a king 
and bind i here as they think to believe it
