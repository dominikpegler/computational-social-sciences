from the son to quean in chief from the gallant to the thief 
from the thief unto his host from the host to husbandman 
from the country to the court and so it come to we again 
how round the world go and every thing that be in it 
the tide of gold and silver ebb and flow in a minute 

what time of night be it 

time of night do you call it

fie on he there be no look for he then 
why sure this gentleman apprehend i not 

it be happy then you be rid of such a fool mistress 

nay sure wench if he find i not out in this 
which be a beat path to any wiseman 
I will never trust he with my reputation 
therefore I make this trial of his wit 
if he can conceive what be good for himself 
he will worse understand what be good for i 

but suppose mrs as it may be likely 
he never see your letter 

how thou ply i 
with supposition why I tell thou wench 
it be equal as impossible for my husband 
to keep it from he as to be young again 
or as his first wife know he which he brag on 
for bear child by he 

there be no remedy then 
I must conclude Francisco be a ass 

I will my letter wench be here again 
I will know he wise ere I send he one 
and travail some five year first 

so he have need methinks 
to understand the word methinks the word 
themselves shall make he do it have he but the perseverance 
of a cock sparrow that will come at Philip 
and can nor write nor read poor fool this coxcomb 
he can do both and your name but Philippa 
and yet to see if he can come when his call 

he never shall be call again for i sirrah 
well as hard as the world go we will have a song wench 
we will not sit up for nothing 

that be poor comfort though 

better then any be bring for aught I see yet So set to your lute 
1 if in this question I propound to thou 
be any any choice 
let i have thy voice 
2 you shall most free 
i which have thou rather be 
if thou may choose thy life 
a fool a fool mistress 
or a old man wife 
2 the choice be hard I know not which be best 
one ill you be bind too and I think that be least 
1 but be not bind my dear sweet 
I can shake off the other 
2 then as you lose your sport by one 
you lose your name by tother 
1 you counsel well but love refuse 
what good counsel often choose 

I have get myself unbind yet merciless villain 
I never feel such hardness since life dwell in i 
it be for my sin that light in yonder window 
that be my only comfort in the wood 
which oft the tremble of a leaf will lose i 
have bring i thus far yet I can hope 
for succour in this plight the world be so pitiless 
and every one will fear or doubt i now 
to knock will be too bold I will to the gate 
and listen if I can hear any stir 

be ever man so cross no it be but sweat sure 
or the dew drop from the leaf above i 
I think it have bleed again these wench business 
be strange unlucky thing and fatal foolery 
no marvel so many gallant die ere thirty 
it be able to vex out a man heart in five year 
the cross that belong to it first arrest 
that set i back two mangey hour at least 
yet that be a thing my heat can have forgive 
because arrest in what kind soever 
be a most gentlemanlike affliction 
but here within a mile of the town forsooth 
and two mile off this place when a man oath 
may have be take for his own security 
and his thought brisk and set upon the business 
to light upon a roguy flight of thief 
pox on they here be the length of one of their whistle 
but one of my dear rascal I pursue so 
the gaol have he and he shall bring out his fellow 
have ever young man love such crooked fortune 
I be glad I be so near yet the surgeon bid i too 
have a great care I shall never think of that now 

one of the thief come back again I will stand close 
he dare not wrong i now so near the house 
and call in vain it be till I see he offer it 

life what shall that be a prodigious thing 
stand just as I shall enter in that shape too 
which always appear terrible 
whatever it be it be make strong against i 
by my ill purpose for it be man own sin 
that put on armour upon all his evil 
and give they strength to strike he be it less 
than what it be my guilt will make it serve 
a wicked man own shadow have distract he 
be this a business now to save a honour 
as it be to spoil one I will pass this then 
stick all hell horror in thou now I dare not 
why may it not be the spirit of my father 
that love this man so well who I make haste 
now to abuse and I have be cross about it 
most fearful hitherto if I well think on it 
escape death but late too nay most miraculous 
and what do fond man venture all these ill for 
that may so sweet rest in honest peace 
for that which be obtain be as he be 
to his own sense but remove near still 
to death eternal what delight have man 
now at this present for his pleasant sin 
of yesterday commit alas it be vanish 
and nothing but the sting remain within he 
the kind man bail i too I will not do it now 
and it be but only that how bless be man 
may he but have his end appear still to he 
that he may read his action in the event 
it will make he write true though he never mean
