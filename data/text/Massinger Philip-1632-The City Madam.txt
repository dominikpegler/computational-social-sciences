
the ship be safe in the pool then 

And make good 
in her rich fraught the name she bear the Speedwell 
my master will find it for on my certain knowledge 
for every hundred that he venture in she 
she have return he five 

and it come timely 
for beside a payment on the nail for a manor 
late purchase by my master his young daughter 
be ripe for marriage 

who Nan and Moll 

mistress Anne and Mary and with some addition 
or it be more punishable in our house 
then scandalum magnatum 

it be great pity 
such a gentleman as my master for that title 
his be a citizen can take from he 
have no male heir to inherit his estate 
and keep his name alive 

the want of one 
swell my young mistress and their madam mother 
with hope above their birth and scale their dream be 
of be make countess and they take state 
as they be such already when you go 
to the Indies there be some shape and proportion 
of a merchant house in our family but since 
my master to gain precedency for my mistress 
above some elder merchant wife be knight 
it be grow a little court in bravery 
variety of fashion and those rich one 
there be few great lady go to a masque 
that do outshine we in their everyday habit 

it be strange my master in his wisdom can 
give the reins to such exorbitancy 

he must 
or there be no peace nor rest for he at home 
I grant his state will bear it yet he be censure 
for his indulgence and for sir John frugal 
by some style sir John prodigal 

be his brother 
mr Luke frugal live 

yes the more 
his misery poor man 

still in the counter 

in a worse place he be redeem from the hole 
to live in our house in hell since his base usage 
consider it be no better my proud lady 
admit he to her table marry ever 
beneath the salt and there he sit the subject 
of her contempt and scorn and dinner end 
his courteous niece find employment for he 
fit a underprentice or a footman 
and not a uncle 

I wonder be a scholar well read and travel 
the world yield mean for man of such desert 
he shall endure it 

he do with a strange patience and to we 
the servant so familiar nay humble 
I will tell you but I be cut off look these 
like a citizen wife and daughter 

in their habit 
they appear other thing but what be the motive 
of this strange preparation

expect their suitor the first the son and heir 
of the lord lady who need my master money 
as his daughter do his honour the second mr plenty 
a rough hew gentleman and new come 
to a great estate and so all aid of art 
in they be excusable 

you have do your part here 
to your study and be curious in the search 
of the nativity 

methinks the mother 
as if she can renew her youth in care 
nay curiosity to appear lovely 
come not behind her daughter 

keep the first place 
and though the churchbook speak she fifty they 
that say she can write thirty more offend she 
then if they tax she honesty tother day 
a tenant of she instruct in her humour 
but one she never see be bring before she 
for say only good young mistress help i 
to the speech of your ladymother so far please she 
that he get his lease renew for it 

how she bristle 
prithee observe she 

as I hope to see 
a country knight son and heir walk bare before you 
when you be a countess as you may be one 
when my master die or leaf trade and I continue 
your principal woman take the upperhand 
of a squire wife though a justice as I must

I hope shall give offence nor let it relish 
of flattery though I proclaim aloud 
I glory in the bravery of your mind 
to which your wealth a servant not that riches

derive from heaven and by your industry 
pull down upon you but in this dear sir 
you have many equal such a man possession 
extend as far as you a second have 
his bag as full a three in credit fly 
as high in the popular voice but the distinction 
and noble difference by which you be

gentle in your abundance good in plenty 
and that you feel compassion in your bowel 
of other misery I have find it sir 
heaven keep i thankful for it while they be curse 
as rigid and inexorable 

I delight not 
to hear this speak to my face 

that shall not grieve you

to beg their bread this gentleman estate 
by wrong extort can advantage you 

if it thrive with he hang i as it will damn he 
if he be not convert 

you be too violent 
or that the ruin of this once brave merchant 
for such he be esteem though now decay 
will raise your reputation with good man 
but you may urge pray you pardon i my zeal 
make i thus bold and vehement in this 
you satisfy your anger and revenge 
for be defeat suppose this it will not 
repair your loss and there be never yet 
but shame and scandal in a victory 
when the rebel unto reason passion fight it 
then for revenge by great soul it be ever 
contemn though offer entertain by none 
but coward base and abject spirit stranger 
to moral honesty and never yet 
acquaint with religion 

our divine

no sir but entreat 
to do yourself a benefit and preserve 
what you possess entire 

how my good brother

your piety to the height I must bold tell you 
you show yourself a atheist

my error and for what I be thus censure 
and I will purge myself or else confess 
a guilty cause 

it be your harsh demeanour 
to your poor brother 

be that all 

it be more 
than can admit defence you keep he as 
a parasite to your table subject to 
the scorn of your proud wife a underling 
to his own niece and can I with my honour 
mix my blood with he that be not sensible 
of his brother misery

a brother of fair part of a clear soul 
religious good and honest 

outward gloss 
often deceive may it not prove so in he 
and yet my long acquaintance with his nature 
render i doubtful but that shall not make 
a breach between we let we in to dinner 
and what trust or employment you think sit 
shall be confer upon he if he prove 
true gold in the touch I will be no mourner for it 

if counterfeit I will never trust my judgement

that they be wretched and by i make so 
it set my happiness off I can not triumph
