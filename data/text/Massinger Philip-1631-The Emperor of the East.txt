in your six year travail friend no doubt you have meet with 
many and rare adventure and observe 
the wonder of each climate vary in 
the manner and the man and so return 
for the future service of your prince and country 
in your understanding better

the best use in my power and hope my glean 
after the full crop other reap before i 
shall not when I be call on altogether 
appear unprofitable yet I leave 
the miracle of miracle in our age 
at home behind i everywhere abroad 
fame with a true though prodigal voice deliver 
such wonder of Pulcheria the princess 
to the amazement nay astonishment rather 
of such as hear it that I find not one 
in all the state and kingdom that I pass through 
worthy to be her second 

she indeed be 
a perfect phoenix and disdain a rival 
her infant year as you know promise much 
but grow to ripeness she transcend and make 
credulity her debtor I will tell you 
in my blunt way to entertain the time 
until you have the happiness to see she 
how in your absence she have bear herself 
and with all possible brevity though the subject 
be such a spacious field as will require 
a abstract of the pure eloquence 
derive from the most famous orator 
the nurse of learning Athens show the world 
in that man that shall undertake to be 
her true historian 

in this you shall do i 
a special favour 

since Arcadius death 
our late great master the protection of 
the prince his son the second Theodosius 
by a general vote and suffrage of the people 
be to her charge assign with the disposure 
of he so many kingdom for his person 
she have so train he up in all those art 
that be both great and good and to be wish 
in a imperial monarch that the mother 
of the Gracchi grave Cornelia Rome still boast of 
the wise Pulcheria but name must be 
no more remember she by her example 
have make the court a kind of academy 
in which true honour be both learn and practise 
her private lodge be a chaste nunnery 
in which her sister as probationer hear 
from she their sovereign abbess all the precept 
read in the school of virtue 

you amaze i 

I shall ere I conclude for here the wonder 
begin not end she soul be so immense 
and her strong faculty so apprehensive 
to search into the depth of deep design 
and of all nature that the burden which 
to many man be insupportable 
to she be but a gentle exercise 
make by the frequent use familiar to she 

with your good favour let i interrupt you 
be as she be in every part so perfect 
methinks that all king of our eastern world 
shall become rival for she 

so they have 
but to no purpose she that know her strength 
to rule and govern monarch scorn to wear 
on her free neck the servile yoke of marriage 
and for one loose desire envy itself 
dare not presume to taint she Venus son 
be blind indeed when he but gaze on she 
her chastity be a rock of diamond 
with which encounter his shaft fly in splinter 
his flame torch in the live spring 
of her perfection quench and to crown all 
she be so impartial when she sit upon 
the high tribunal neither sway with piety 
nor awe by fear beyond her equal scale 
that it be not superstition to believe 
Astrea once more live upon the earth 
Pulcheria breast her temple 

you have give she 
a admirable character

and such be the command power of virtue 
that from her vicious enemy it compel 
paean of praise as a due tribute to she solemn loud music

and may continue so if it please your grace 

this speech be well project 

do your conscience 
I will begin with you whisper unto you 
what here you stand accuse of be you name 
the president of projector 

justify it man 
and tell she in what thou be useful 

that be apparent 
and if you please ask some about the court 
and they will tell you too my rare invention 
they owe their bravery perhaps mean to purchase 
and can live without i I alas 
lend out my labour brain to use and sometime 
for a drachma in the pound the more the pity 
I be all patience and endure the curse 
of many for the profit of one patron 

I do conceive the rest what be the second 

the minion of the suburb 

what have he 
to do in Constantinople 

I steal in now and then 
as I be think useful marry there I be call 
the squire of dame or servant of the sex 
and by the allowance of some sportful lady 
honour with that title 

spare your character 
you be here decipher stand by with your compeer 
what be the three a creature I never hear of 
the master of the manner and the habit 
you have a double office 

in my action 
I make both good for by my theorem 
which your polite and terse gallant practise 
I rerefine the court and civilize 
their barbarous nature I have in a table 
with curious punctuality set down 
to a hair breadth how low a new stamp courtier 
may veil to a country gentleman and by 
gradation to his merchant mercer draper 
his linen man and tailor 

pray you discover 
this hide mystery 

if the foresay courtier 
as it may chance sometime find not his name 
write in the citizen book with a state humh 
he may salute they after three day wait 
but if he owe they money that he may 
preserve his credit let he in policy never 
appoint a day of payment so they may hope still 
but if he be to take up more his page 
may attend they at the gate and usher they 
into his cellar and when they be warm with wine 
conduct they to his bedchamber and though then 
he be under his barber hand assoon as see 
he must start up to embrace they veil thus low 
nay though he call they cousin it be the better 
his dignity no way wrong in it 

here be a fine knave 

do this rule hold without exception sirrah a 
for courtier in general 

no dear madam 
for one of the last edition and for he 
I have compose a dictionary in which 
he be instruct how when and to who 
to be proud or humble at what time of the year 
he may do a good deed for itself and that be 
write in dominical letter all day else 
be his own and of those day the several hour 
mark out and to what use 

show we your method 
I be strange take with it 

it will deserve 
a pension I hope First a strong cullis 
in his bed to heighten appetite shuttlecock 
to keep he in breath when he rise tennis court 
be chargeable and the ride of great horse 
too boisterous for my young courtier let the old one 
I think not of use it next his meditation 
how to court his mistress and that he may seem witty 
let he be furnish with confederate jest 
between he and his friend that on occasion 
they may ventem mutual what his pace and garb 
must be in the presence than the length of his sword 
the fashion of the hilt what the blade be 
it matter not it be barbarism to use it 
unless to show his strength upon a and iron 
so the soon break the better 

how I abuse 
this precious time projector I treat first 
of you and your disciple you roar out 
all be the king his will above his law 
and that fit tribute be too gentle yoke 
for his poor subject whisper in his ear 
if he will have they fear no man shall dare 
to bring a salad from his country garden 
without the pay gubell kill a hen 
without excise and that if he desire 
to have his child or his servant wear 
their head upon their shoulder you affirm 
in policy it be fit the owner shall 
pay for they by the pole or if the prince want 
a present sum he may command a city 
impossibility and for nonperformance 
compel it to submit to any fine 
his officer shall impose be this the way 
to make our emperor happy can the groan 
of his subject yield he music must his threshold 
be wash with widow and wrong orphan tear 
or his power grow contemptible 

I begin 
to feel myself a rogue again 

but you be 
the squire of dame devote to the service 
of gamesome lady the hide mystery 
discover their close bawd thy slavish breath 
fan the fire of lust the gobetween 
this female and that wanton sir your art 
can blind a jealous husband and disguise 
like a milliner or shoemaker convey 
a letter in a pantofle or glove 
without suspicion nay at his table 
in a case of picktooth you instruct they how 
to parley with their eye and make the temple 
a mart of looseness to discover all 
the subtle brokage be to teach in public 
those private practise which be in justice 
severe to be punish 

I be cast 
a jury of my patroness can quit i

of whatsoever else I can bequeath you

a equal portion of my possession 
to you my son but unto thou my daughter 
my joy my darling pardon i though I 
repeat his word if my prophetic soul

to be a perfect horseman or to know 
the word of the chase or a fair man of arm 
or to be able to pierce to the depth 
or write a comment on the obscure poet 
I grant be ornament but your main scope 
shall be to govern man to guard your own 
if not enlarge your empire 

you be build up 
by the curious hand of nature to revive 
the memory of Alexander or by 
a prosperous success in your brave action 
to rival Caesar

do not lose 
your subject heart 

what be it to have the mean 
to be magnificent and not exercise 
the boundless virtue

to that which strict philosophy allow of 
as if you be a private man

'slight you live as it

of the loose and saucy language you now practise 
have forfeit your head 

how be this 

I know not 
what the play may prove but I assure you that 
I do not like the prologue 

o the miserable 
condition of a prince who though he vary 
more shape than Proteus in his mind and manner 
he can win a universal suffrage 
from the manyheaded monster multitude 
like Aesop foolish frog they trample on he 
as a senseless block if his government be easy 
and if he prove a stork they croak and rail 
against he as a tyrant I will put off 
that majesty of which you think I have

and not with absolute power against which wretch 
you be not to dispute dare you that be 
my creature by my prodigal favour fashion

of a incomparable sister who all part 
of our world that be make happy in knowledge 
of her perfection with wonder gaze on

or wanton lust have teach you undertake 
to give your sovereign law to follow that 
your ignorance mark out to he walk by 

how be we

how be I trench on be that temperance

Amasia sister to the duke of Athens 
her age eighteen descend lineal 
from Theseus as by her pedigree 
will be make apparent of his lusty kindred 
and lose so much time it be strange as I live she have 
a philosophical aspect there be 
more wit than beauty in her face and when 
I court she it must be in trope and figure 
or she will cry absurd she will have her elench 
to cut off any fallacy I can hope 
to put upon she and expect I shall 
ever conclude in syllogism and those true one 
in part & toto or she will tire i with 
her tedious elocution in the praise 
of the increase of generation for which

with he by who they be so 

I confess it 

not to hold you in suspense behold the virgin 
rich in her natural beauty no way borrow

from the base to the battlement 

ha now I view she better 
I know she it be the maid that not long since 
be a petitioner her bravery 
so alter she I have forget her face 

So have the emperor 

Shee hold out yet 
and yield not to the assault 

Shee be strong guard 
in her virgin blush 

when you know fair creature 
it be the emperor that honour you 
with such a strict survey of your sweet part 
in thankfulness you can but return 
due reverence for the favour 

I be lose 
in my astonishment at the glorious object 
and yet rest doubtful whether he expect 
be more than man my adoration 
since sure there be divinity about he 
or will rest satisfy if my humble knee 
in duty thus bow to he 

ha it speak 

Shee be no statue sir 

suppose she one 
and that she have nor organ voice nor heat 
most willing I will resign my empire 
so it may be to aftertimes record

the nectar of her lip I do not give it 
the praise it merit antiquity be too poor 
to help i with a simile to express she 
let i drink often from this live spring 
to nourish new invention 

do not surfeit 
in overgreedy devour that 
which may without satiety feast you often 
from the moderation in receive they 
the choice viand do continue please 
to the most curious palate if you think her 
worth your embrace and the sovereign title 
of the grecian empress 

if how much you sin 
only to doubt it the possession of she 
make all that be before most precious to i 
common and cheap in this you have show yourself 
a provident protectress I already 
grow weary of the absolute command 
of my so numerous subject and desire 
no sovereignty but here and write down glad 
a period to my wish 

yet before 
it be too late consider her condition

a new convert Christian 

let i know 
the man to who religious mean I owe 
so great a debt 

you be advance too high sir 
to acknowledge a behold it be discharge 
and I beyond my hope reward if 
my service please your majesty 

take this pledge 
of our assure love be there none here 
have suit to prefer on such a day as this 
my bounty be without limit o my dear 
I will not hear thou speak whatever in 
thy thought be apprehend I grant free 
thou will plead thy unworthiness by thyself

our eastern queen at their full height bow to thou 
and be in their best trim thy foil and shadow 
excuse the violence of my love which can 
admit the least delay command the patriarch 
with speed to do his holy office for we 
that when we be make one 

you must forbear sir 
she be not yet baptize 

in the same hour 
in which she be confirm in our faith 
we mutual will give away each other 
and both be gainer we will hear no reply 
that may divert we on 

you may hereafter 
please to remember to who furtherance 
you owe this height of happiness 

as I be 
your creature when I first petition you 
I will continue so and you shall find i 
though a empress still your servant 

here be a marriage 
make up on the sudden 

I repine not at 
the fair maid fortune though I fear the princess 
have some peculiar end in it 

who be so simple 
only to doubt it 

it be too apparent 
she have prefer a creature of her own 
by who mean she may still keep to herself 
the government of the empire 

where as if 
the emperor have espouse some neighbour queen 
Pulcheria with all her wisdom can not 
keep her preeminence 

be it as it will 
it be not now to be alter heaven I say 
turn all to the best 

be we come to pray again 

leave thy profaneness 

will it will leave i 
I be sure I thrive not by it 

Come to the temple 

even where you will I know not what to think on it 

nor this nor the age before we ever look on 
the like solemnity 

a sudden fever 
keep i at home pray you my lord acquaint i 
with the particular 

you may presume 
no pomp nor ceremony can be want 
where there be privilege to command and mean 
to cherish rare invention 

I believe it 
but the sum of all in brief 

pray you so take it 
fair Athenais not long since a suitor 
and almost in her hope forsake first 
be christen and the emperor mother name 
Eudoxia as he will impose upon she 
Pulcheria the ever matchless princess 
assist by her reverend aunt Maria 
her godmother 

and who the masculine witness 

at the new empress suit I have the honour 
for which I must ever serve she 

it be a grace 
with justice you may boast of 

the marriage follow 
and as it be say the emperor make bold 
to turn the day tonight for to bed they go 
assoon as they have dine and there be wager 
lay by some merry lord he have already 
beget a boy upon she 

that be yet 
to be determine of but I be certain 
a prince so soon in his disposition alter 
be never hear nor read of 

but of late 
frugal and spare now nor bound nor limit 
to his magnificent bounty he affirm 
have receive more blessing by his empress 
then he can hope in thankfulness to heaven 
he can be too prodigal to other 
whatever she offer to his royal hand 
he sign without peruse it 

I be here 
enjoin to free all such as lie for debt 
the creditor to be pay out of his coffer 

and I all malefactor that be not 
convict or for treason or foul murder 
such only be except 

it be a rare clemency 

which we must not dispute but put in practice 

sir by your own rule of philosophy 
you know thing violent last not royal bounty 
be great and gracious while they be dispense 
with moderation but when their excess 
in give giantbulk to other take from 
the prince just proportion they lose 
the name of virtue and their nature chang 
grow the most dangerous vice 

in this sister 
your wisdom be not circular they that sow 
in narrow bound can expect in reason 
a crop beyond their venture what I do 
disperse I lend and will with usury 
return unto my heap I only then 
be rich and happy though my coffer sound 
with emptiness when my glad subject feel 
their plenty and felicity be my gift 
and they will find when they with cheerfulness 
supply not my defect I be the stomach 
to the politic body of the state the limb 
grow sudden faint and feeble I can urge 
proof of more fineness in their shape and language 
but none of great strength dissuade i not 
what we will we will do yet to assure you 
your care do not offend we for a hour 
be happy in the converse of my best 
and dear comfort may you please to licence 
my privacy some few minute 

licence sir 
I have no will but be derive from you 
and that still wait upon you nor can I 
be leave with such security with any 
as with the gracious Princess who receive 
addition though she be all excellence 
in be style your sister 

o sweet creature 
let i be censure fond and too indulgent 
nay though they say uxorious I care not 
her love and sweet humility exact 
a tribute far beyond my power to pay 
her matchless goodness forward 

now you find 
your die father prophecy that foretell 
your present greatness to the full accomplish 
for the poor aide and furtherance I lend you 
I willing forget 

even that bind i 
to a more strict remembrance of the favour 
nor shall you from my soul ingratitude 
in any circumstance ever find cause 
to upbraid i with your benefit 

I believe so 
pray you give we leave what now I must deliver 
under the deep seal of secrecy 
though it be for you good will give assurance 
of what be look for if you not alone 
hear but obey my counsel 

they must be 
of a strange nature if with zealous speed 
I put they not in practice 

it be impertinence 
to dwell on circumstance since the wound 
require a sudden cure especial 
since you that be the happy instrument 
elect to it though young in your judgement 
write far above your year and may instruct 
such as be more experience 

good madam 
in this I must oppose you I be well 
acquaint with my weakness and it will not 
become your wisdom by which I be raise 
to this titulary height that shall correct 
the pride and overween of my fortune 
to play the parasite to it in ascribe 
that merit to i unto which I can 
pretend no interest pray you excuse 
my bold simplicity and to my weight 
design i where you please and you shall find 
in my obedience I be still your creature 

it be noble answer and I glory in 
the building I have raise go on sweet lady 
in this your virtuous progress but to the point 
you know nor do I envy it you have 
acquire that power which not long since be my 
in govern the emperor and must use 
the strength you hold in the heart of his affection 
for his private as the public preservation 
to which there be no great enemy 
than his exorbitant prodigality 
however his sycophant and flatterer call it 
royal magnificence and though you may 
urge what be do for your honour must not be 
curb or be control by you you can in 
your wisdom but conceive if that the torrent 
of his violent bounty be not stop or lessen 
it will prove most pernicious therefore madam 
since it be your duty as you be his wife 
to give he save counsel and in be 
almost his idol may command he to 
take any shape you please with a powerful hand 
to stop he in his precipice to ruin 

avert it heaven 

heaven be most gracious to you madam 
in choose you to be the instrument 
of such a pious work you see he sign 
what suit soever be prefer not once 
inquire what it be yield himself 
a prey to all I will therefore have you lady 
as I know you will to advise he or command he 
as he will reap the plenty of your favour 
to use more moderation in his bounty 
and that before he give he will consider 
the what to who and wherefore 

do you think 
such arrogance or usurpation rather 
of what be proper and peculiar 
to every private husband and much more 
to he a emperor can rank with the obedience 
and duty of a wife be we appoint 
in our creation let i reason with you 
to rule or to obey or because he love i 
with a kind impotence must I tyrannize 
over his weakness or abuse the strength 
with which he arm i to his wrong or like 
a prostitute creature merchandise 
our mutual delight for hire or to 
serve my own sordid end in vulgar nuptial 
priority be explode though there be 
a difference in the party and shall I 
his vassal from obscurity raise by he 
to this so eminent light presume to appoint he 
to do or not to do this or that when wife 
be well accommodate by their husband 
with all thing both for use and ornament 
let they fix there and never dare to question 
their will or action for myself I vow 
though now my lord will rash give away 
his sceptre and imperial diadem 
or if there can be any thing more precious 
I will not cross it but I know this be 
but a trial of my temper and as such 
I do receive it or if it be otherwise 
you be so subtle in your argument 
I dare not stay to hear they 

be it even so 
I have power over these yet and command their stay 
to hearken near to i 

we be charge 
by the emperor our brother to attend 
the empress service 

you be too mortify sister 
with reverence I speak it for young lady 
to keep you company I be so tire 
with your tedious exhortation doctrine use 
of your religious morality 
that for my health sake I must take the freedom 
to enjoy a little of those pretty pleasure 
that I be bear to 

when I come to your year 
I will do as you do but till then with your pardon 
I will lose no more time I have not learn to dance yet 
nor sing but holy hymn and those to vile tune too 
nor to discourse but of schoolman opinion 
how shall I answer my suitor since I hope 
ere long I shall have many without practice 
to write and speak something that be not derive 
from the father of philosophy 

we shall shame 
our breed sister if we shall go on thus 

it be for your credit that we study 
how to converse with man woman with woman 
yield but a barren argument 

she frown 
but you will protect we madam 

yes and love 
your sweet simplicity 

all young girl be so 
till they know the way of it 

but when we be enter 
we shall on a good round pace 

I will leave you madam 

and we our duty with you 

on all hand 
thus slight no way leave be I grow stupid 
in my invention can I make no use 
of the emperor bounty now it be think within there 

madam enter a servant 

it shall be so near your ear 
draw a petition to this end 

beside 
the danger to prefer it I believe 
it will never be grant 

how be this be you grow 
from a servant my director let i hear 
no more of this dispatch I will master he 
at his own weapon Exit servant 

let i understand it 
if yet there be aught want that may perfect 
a general happiness 

the people joy 
in sea of acclamation flow in 
to wait on you 

their love with bounty levy 
be a sure guard obedience force from fear 
paper fortification which in danger 
will yield to the impression of a reed 
or of itself fall off 

true Philanax 
and by that certain compass we resolve 
to steer our bark of government 

it be well 

my dear and my alldeserving sister 
as a petitioner kneel it must not be 
pray you rise although your suit be half my empire 
it be free grant 

your alacrity 
to give have make a beggar yet before 
my suit be by your sacred hand and seal 
confirm it be necessary you peruse 
the sum of my request

your judgement in conceive what it be fit 
for you to ask and we to grant so much 
as to proceed with caution give i my signet 
with confidence I sign it and here vow 
by my father soul but with your free consent 
it be irrevocable 

what if she now 
call to memory how often we 
have cross her government in revenge have make 
petition for our head 

they must even off then 
no ransom can redeem we 

let those jewel 
so high rate by the persian merchant 
be buy and as a sacrifice from we 
present to Eudoxa Shee be only 
worthy to wear they I be angry with 
the unresistable necessity 
of my occasion and important care 
that so long keep i from she 

go to the empress 
and tell she on the sudden I be sick 
and do desire the comfort of a visit 
if she please to vouchsafe it from i use 
your humble language but when once I have she 
in my possession I will rise and speak 
in a high strain say it raise storm no matter 
fool judge by the event my end be honest exeunt 

what be become of she can she that carry 
such glorious excellence of light about her 
be anywhere conceal 

we have seek her lodging 
and all we can learn from the servant be

the attendance of her other officer 
by her express command deny

impertinent circumstance whither go she speak 

as they guess to the laurel grove

to acknowledge a superior 

there she walk 

if she be not sick of the sullen I see not 
the least infirmity in she

it be in vain 
she be a empress once but by my gift 
which be abuse I do recall my grant 
you be read in story call to remembrance 
what the great Hector mother Hecuba 
be to Ulysses Ilium sack 

a slave 

to i thou be so 

wonder and amazement 
quite overwhelm i how be I transform 
how have I lose my liberty 

thou shall know 
too soon no doubt who be that with such rudeness 
beat at the door 

the prince Paulinus madam 
send from the emperor to attend upon 
the gracious empress 

and who be your slave now 

sister repent in time and beg pardon 
for your presumption 

it be resolve 
from i return this answer to Paulinus 
she shall not come she be i the emperor have 
no interest in she Exit servant 

whatsoever I be 
you take not from your power over i to yield 
a reason for this usage 

though my will be 
sufficient to add to thy affliction 
know wretched thing it be not thy fate but folly 
have make thou what thou be it be some delight 
to urge my merit to one so ungrateful 
therefore with horror hear it when thou be 
thrust as a stranger from thy father house 
expose to all calamity that want 
can throw upon thou thy own brother scorn 
and in thy hope as by the world forsake 
my pity the last altar that be leave thou 
I hear thy Siren charm with feeling hear they 
and my compassion make my eye vy tear 
with thou dissemble crocodile and when queen 
be emulous for thy imperial bed 
the garment of thy sorrow east aside

with youthful fire I bring thou to his presence 
and how my deep design for thy good plot 
succeed to my wish be apparent 
and needs no repetition 

I be conscious 
of your so many and unequalled favor 
but find not how I may accuse myself 
for any fact commit that with justice 
can raise your anger to this height against i 

pride and forgetfulness will not let thou see that 
against which now thou can not close thy eye 
what injury can be equal to thy late 
contempt of my good counsel when I urge 
the emperor prodigal bounty and entreat 
that you will use your power to give they limit 
or at the least a due consideration 
of such as sue and for what ere he sign it 
in opposition you bring against I 
the obedience of a wife that lady be not 
be well accommodate by their lord 
to question but much less to cross their pleasure 
nor will you though the emperor be resolve 
to give away his sceptre hinder it 
since it be do for your honour cover with 
false color of humility your ambition 

and be this my offence 

as wicked counsel 
be still most hurtful unto those that give it 
such as deny to follow what be good 
in reason be the first that must repent it 
when I please you shall hear more in the mean time 
thank your own wilful folly that have change you 
from a empress to a bondwoman 

force the door 
kill those that dare resist 

dear sir redeem i 

o suffer not for your own honour sake 
the empress you so late love to be make 
a prisoner in the court

and try then 
what interest my reverend sister have 
to force you from they 

what strange maygame be this 
though do in sport how ill this levity 
become your wisdom 

I be serious sir 
and have do nothing but what you in honour 
and as you be yourself a emperor 
stand bind to justify

your care and absolute power

of any imperfection I shall be 
incredulous 

Shee be yet a woman sir

without discovery forbear the room 
yet be within call what a earthquake I feel in i 
and on the sudden my whole fabric totter 
my blood within i turn and through my vein 
part with natural redness I discern it 
change to a fatal yellow what a army 
of hellish fury in the horrid shape 
of doubt and fear charge on i rise to my rescue 
thou stout maintainer of a chaste wife honour 
the confidence of her virtue be not shake 
with the wind of vain surmise much less suffer 
the devil jealousy to whisper to i

I charge thou leave i will thou force i to 
give fuel to that fire I will put out

Eudoxia to come to i will I have 
never know she by that name my mother name 
or that for her own sake she have continue 
poor Athenais still no intermission

write in the table of my memory 
to warrant my suspicion how Paulinus 
though ever think a man averse to woman 
first give her entertainment make her way 
for audience to my sister then I do 
myself observe how he be ravish with 
the gracious delivery of her story 
which be I grant the bait that first take i too 
she be his convert what the rhetoric be 
he use I know not and since she be i 
in private as in public what a mass 
of grace and favour have she heap upon he 
and but today this fatal fruit she be come 
can she be guilty 

you seem trouble sir 
my innocence make i bold to ask the cause 
that I may ease you of it no salute 
after four long hour absence 

prithee forgive i kiss she 
i thank I find Paulinus on her lip 
and the fresh nectar that I draw from thence

you have it still 

by your sacred life and fortune 
a oath I dare not break I have eat it 

do you know how this oath bind 

too well to break it 

that ever man to please his brutish sense 
shall slave his understanding to his passion 
and take with soon fade white and red 
deliver up his credulous ear to hear 
the magic of a Siren and from these 
believe there ever be be or can be 
more than a seem honesty in bad woman

who wait come all 
nay sister not so near be of the sex 
I fear you be infect to 

what mean you

as small as atom that there may no sign 
be leave thou ever be so will thou live 
till thou be blast with the dreadful lightning

to thy insatiate lust but what be send 
as a dear favour from i how have I sin 
in my dotage on this creature but to she 
I have live as I be bear a perfect virgin 
nay more I think it not enough to be 
true to her bed but that I must feed high 
to strengthen my ability to cloy 
her ravenous appetite little suspect 
she will desire a change 

I never do sir 

be dumb I will not waste my breath in tax 
thy base ingratitude how I have raise thou 
will by the world be to thy shame speak often 
but for that ribald who hold in my empire

by prodigal gift to draw the needy soldier 
the tribune or centurion to a faction 
of which I will rise up the head against he 
I hold no place of strength fortress or castle 
in my command that can give sanctuary 
to malcontent or countenance rebellion 
I have build no palace to face the court 
nor do my follower bravery shame his train 
and though I can blame my fate for want 
my competent mean of life deserve no envy 
in what then be I dangerous 

his displeasure 
reflect on none of those particular 
which you have mention though some jealous prince 
in a subject can brook they 

none of these 
in what then be I worthy his suspicion 
but it may nay it must be some informer 
to who my innocence appear a crime 
have poison his late good opinion of i 
it be not to die but in the censure of 
so good a master guilty that afflict i 

there be no remedy 

no I have a friend yet 
can the strictness of your warrant give way to it 
to who the state I stand in now deliver 
that by fair intercession for i will 
so far prevail that my defence unheard 
I shall not innocent or guilty suffer 
without a fit distinction 

these false hope 
my lord abuse you what man when condemn 
do ever find a friend or who dare lend 
a eye of pity to that starcrossed subject 
on who his sovereign frown 

she that dare plead 
for innocence without a fee the empress 
my great and gracious mistress 

there be your error 
her many favour which you hope shall make you 
prove your undo Shee poor lady be 
banish for ever from the emperor presence 
and his confirm suspicion to his wrong 
that you have be over familiar with she 
doom you to death I know you understand i 

over familiar 

in share with he 
those sweet and secret pleasure of his bed 
which can admit no partner 

and be that 
the crime for which I be to die of all 
my numerous sin be there not one of weight 
enough to sink i if he borrow not 
the colour of a guilt I never see 
to paint my innocence in a deform 
and monstrous shape but that it be profane 
to argue heaven of ignorance or injustice 
I now shall tax it have the star that reign 
at my nativity such curse influence 
as not alone to make I miserable 
but in the neighbourhood of her goodness to i 
to force contagion upon a lady 
who pure flame be not inferior 
to they when they shine bright to die for she 
compare with what she suffer be a trifle 
by her example warn let all great woman 
hereafter throw pride and contempt on such 
as true serve they since a retribution 
in lawful courtesy be now style lust 
and to be thankful to a servant merit 
be grow a vice no virtue 

these complaint 
be to no purpose think on the long flight 
your better part must make 

Shee be prepare 
nor can the free of a innocent 
from the emperor furious jealousy hinder she 
it shall out it be resolve but to be whisper 
to you alone what a solemn preparation 
be make here to put forth a inch of taper 
in itself almost extinguish mortal poison 
the hangman sword the halter 

it be leave to you 
to make choice of which you please 

any will serve 
to take away my gout and life together 
I will not have the emperor imitate 
Rome monster Nero in that cruel mercy 
he show to Seneca when you have discharge 
what you be trust with and I have give you 
reason beyond all doubt or disputation 
of the empress and my innocence when I be dead 
since it be my master pleasure and high treason 
in you not to obey it I conjure you 
by the hope you have of happiness hereafter 
since i in this world be now part from i 
that you will win the young man to repentance 
of the wrong do to his chaste wife Eudoxia 
and if perchance he shed a tear for what 
in his rashness he impose on his true servant 
so it cure he of future jealousy 
it will prove a precious balsamum and find i 
when I be in my grave now when you please 
for I be ready 

his word work strange on i 
and I will do but I know not what to think on it Ex 

still in his sullen mood no intermission 
of his melancholy fit 

it rather madam 
increase then grow less 

in the next room 
to his bedchamber we watch for he by sign 
give we to understand he will admit 
nor company nor conference 

do he take 
no rest as you can guess 

not any madam 
like a numidian lion by the cunning 
of the desperate huntsman take in a toil 
and force into a spacious cage he walk 
about his chamber we may hear he gnash 
his tooth in rage which open hollow groan 
and murmur issue from his lip like wind 
imprison in the cavern of the earth 
strive for liberty and sometime throw 
his body on his bed then on the ground 
and with such violence that we more than fear 
and still do if the tempest of his passion 
by your wisdom be not lay he will commit 
some outrage on himself 

his better angel 
I hope will stay he from so foul a mischief 
nor shall my care be want 

twice I hear he 
say false Eudoxia how much be thou 
unworthy of these tear then sigh and straight 
rores out Paulinus be his gouty age 
to be prefer before my strength and youth 
then groan again so many way express 
the affliction of a torture soul that we 
who weep in vain for what we can not help 
be sharer in his suffering 

though your sorrow 
be not to be condemn it take not from 
the burden of his misery we must practise 
with some fresh object to divert his thought 
from that they be whole fix on 

can I gain 
the freedom of access I will present he 
with this petition will your highness please a paper deliver 
to look upon it you will soon find there 
what my intent and hope be enter Theod 

Hal it be he 

stand close 
and give way to his passion it be not safe 
to stop they in their violent course before 
they have spend themselves 

I play the fool and be 
unequal to myself delinquent be 
to suffer not the innocent I have do 
nothing which will not hold weight in the scale 
of my impartial justice neither feel 
the worm of conscience upbraid i 
for one black deed of tyranny wherefore then 
shall I torment myself great julius will not 
rest satisfy that his wife be free from fact 
but only for suspicion of a crime 
s'ud a divorce nor be this Roman rigour 
censure as cruel and still the wise italian 
that know the honour of his family 
depend upon the purity of his bed 
for a kiss nay wanton look will plough up mischief 
and sow the seed of his revenge in blood 
and shall I to who power the law be a servant 
that stand accountable to none for what 
my will call a offence be compel 
and on such ground to raise a altar to 
my anger though I grant it be cement 
with a loose strumpet and adulterer gore 
repent the justice of my fury no 
I shall not yet still my excess of love 
feed high in the remembrance of her choice 
and sweet embrace will persuade i that 
connivance or remission of her fault 
make warrantable by her true submission 
for her offence may be excusable 
do not the cruelty of my wound honour 
with a open mouth deny it 

I approve of 
your good intention and I hope it will prosper 
he now seem calm let we upon our knee 
encompass he most royal sir 

sweet brother 

as you be our sovereign by the tie of nature 
you be bind to be a father in your care 
to we poor orphan 

show compassion sir 
unto yourself 

the majesty of your fortune 
shall fly above the reach of grief 

and it be 
impair if you yield to it 

wherefore pay you 
this adoration to a sinful creature 
I be flesh and blood as you be sensible 
of heat and cold as much a slave unto 
the tyranny of my passion as the mean 
of my poor subject the proud attribute 
by oil tongue flattery impose upon we 
as sacred glorious high invincible 
the deputy of heaven and in that 
omnipotent with all false title else 
coin to abuse our frailty though compound 
and by the breath of sycophant apply 
cure not the least fit of a ague in we 
we may give poor man riches confer honour 
on undeserver raise or ruin such 
as be beneath we and with this puff up 
ambition will persuade we to forget 
that we be man but he that sit above we 
and to who at our utmost rate we be 
but pageant property deride our weakness 
in i to who you kneel it be most apparent 
can I call back yesterday with all their aide 
that bow unto my sceptre or restore 
my mind to that tranquillity and peace 
it then enjoy can it make Eudoxia chaste 
or vile Paulinus honest 

if I may 
without offence deliver my opinion 

what will you say 

that on my soul the empress 
Is innocent 

the good Paulinus guiltless 

and this shall yield you comfort 

in be guilty 
of a offence far far transcend that 
they stand condemn for call you this a comfort 
suppose it can be true a corrosive rather 
not to eat out dead flesh but putrify 
what yet be sow be murder ever hold 
a cure for jealousy or the cry blood 
of innocence a balm to take away 
her fester anguish as you do desire 
I shall not do a justice on myself 
add to the proof by which Paulinus fall 
and not take from they in your charity 
soon believe that they be false than I 
unrighteous in my judgement subject life 
be not their prince tennisball to be band 
in sport away all that I can endure 
for they if they be guilty be a atom 
to the mountain of affliction I pull on i 
shall they prove innocent 

for your majesty peace 
I more than hope they be not the false oath 
take by the empress and for which she can 
plead no excuse convict she and yield 
a sure defence for your suspicion of she 
and yet to be resolve since strong doubt be 
more grievous for the most part than to know 
a certain loss 

it be true Chrysapius 
be there a possible mean 

it be offer to you 
if you please to embrace it some few minute 
make truce with passion and but read and follow 
what be there project you shall find a key 
will make your entrance easy to discover 
her secret thought and then as in your wisdom 
you shall think fit you may determine of she 
and rest confirm whether Paulinus die 
a villain or a martyr 

it may do 
nay sure it must yet howsoever it fall 
I be most wretched which way in my wish 
I shall fashion the event I be so distract 
I can yet resolve of follow i 
though in my name all name be comprehend 
I must have witness in what degree 
I have do wrong or suffer 

hope the best sir exeunt 

why be thou slow thou rest of trouble death 
to stop a wretch breath 
that call on thou and offer her sad heart 
a prey unto thy dart 
I be nor young nor fair be therefore bold 
sorrow have make i old 
deform and wrinkle all that I can crave 
be quiet in my grave 
such as live happy hold long life a jewel 
but to i thou be cruel 
if thou end not my tedious misery 
and I soon cease to be 
strike and strike home then pity unto i 
in one short hour delay be tyranny 
thus like a die swan to a sad tune 
I sing my own dirge will a requiem follow 
which in my penitence I despair not of 
this brittle glass of life already break 
with misery the long and quiet sleep 
of death will be most welcome yet before 
we end our pilgrimage it be fit that we 
shall leave corruption and foul sin behind we 
but with wash foot and hand the heathen dare not 
enter their profane temple and for I 
to hope my passage to eternity 
can be make easy till I have shake of 
the burden of my sin in free confession 
aid with sorrow and repentance for they 
be against reason it be not lay by 
my royal ornament or put on 
this garment of humility and contrition 
the throw dust and ash on my head 
long fast to tame my proud flesh that can make 
atonement for my soul that must be humble 
all outward sign of penitence else be useless 
Chrysapius do assure i he will bring i 
a holy man from who have discover 
my secret cry sin I may receive 
full absolution and he keep his word 
welcome most reverend sir upon my knee 
I entertain you 

noble sir forbear 
the place the sacred office that I come for 
command all privacy my penitent daughter 
be careful as you wish remission from i 
that in confession of your sin you hide not 
one crime who ponderous weight when you will make 
your flight above the firmament that may sink you 
a foolish modesty in conceal aught 
be now far worse than impudence to profess 
and justify your guilt be therefore free 
so may the gate of mercy open to you 

First then I ask a pardon for my be 
ingrateful to heaven bounty 

a good entrance 

greatness come from above and I raise to it 
from a low condition sinful forget 
from whence it come and look on myself 
in the false glass of flattery I receive it 
as a debt due to my beauty not a gift 
or favour from the emperor 

it be not well 

pride wait on unthankfulness and no more 
remember the compassion of the princess 
and the mean she use to make i what I be 
contest with she and with sore eye sing 
she great light as it dim my I practise 
to have it quite put out 

a great offence 
but on repentance not unpardonable 
forward 

o father what I now must utter 
I fear in the delivery will destroy i 
before you have absolve i 

heaven be gracious 
out with it 

heaven command we to tell truth 
yet I most sinful wretch forswear myself 

on what occasion 

quite forget that 
a innocent truth can never stand in need 
of a guilty lie be on the sudden ask 
by the emperor my husband for a apple 
present by he I swear I have eat it 
when my grieve conscience too well know I send it 
to comfort sick Paulinus be a man 
I true love and favour 

a cold sweat 
like the juice of hemlock bathe i aside 

and from this 
a furious jealousy get possession 
of the good emperor heart in his rage he doom 
the innocent lord to die my perjury 
the fatal cause of murder 

take heed daughter 
you niggle not with your conscience and religion 
in still he a innocent from your fear 
and shame to accuse yourself the emperor 
have many spy upon you see such grace 
which virtue can not warrant shower upon he 
glance in public and more liberal favour 
in your private chamber meeting make way 
for foul adultery nor can he be 
but sensible of the compact pass between you 
to the ruin of his honour 

hear i father 
I look for comfort but in this you come 
to add to my affliction 

cause not you 
your own damnation in conceal that 
which may in your discovery find forgiveness 
open your eye set heaven or hell before you 
in the reveal of the truth you shall 
prepare a palace for your soul to dwell in 
store with celestial blessing whereas if 
you palliate your crime and dare beyond 
play with lightning in conceal it 
expect a dreadful dungeon fill with horror 
and neverending torment 

may they fall 
eternal upon i and increase 
when that which we call time have lose its name 
may lightning cleave the centre of the earth 
and I sink quick before you have absolve i 
into the bottomless abyss I fever 
in one unchaste desire nay in a thought 
I wrong the honour of the emperor bed 
I do deserve I grant more than I suffer 
in that my fervour and desire to please he 
in my holy meditation press upon i 
and will not be keep out now to dissemble 
when I shall sudden be insensible 
of what the world speak of i be mere madness 
and though you be incredulous I presume 
if as I kneel now my eye swell with tear 
my hand heave up thus my stretch heartstring ready 
to break asunder my incense lord 
his storm of jealousy blow over shall hear i 
he will believe I lie not 

rise and see he discover himself 
on his knee with joy affirm it 

can this be 

my sister and the rest there all bear witness 
in free this incomparable lady 
from the suspicion of guilt I do 
accuse myself and willing submit 
to any penance she in justice shall 
please to impose upon i 

royal sir your ill opinion of i be soon forgive 

but how you can make satisfaction to 
the poor Paulinus he be dead in reason 
you must conclude impossible 

and in that 
I be most miserable the ocean 
of joy which in your innocence flow high to i 
ebb in the thought of my unjust command 
by which he die o Philanax as thy name 
interpret speak thou thou have ever be 
a lover of the king and thy whole life 
can witness thy obedience to my will 
in put that in execution which 
be trust to thou say but yet this once 
thou have not do what rash I command 
and that Paulinus live and thy reward 
for not perform that which I enjoin thou 
shall centuple whatever yet thy duty 
or merit challenge from i 

it be too late sir 
he be dead and when you know he be unable 
to wrong you in the way that you suspect 
you will wish it have be otherwise 

unable 

I be sure he be a eunuch and may safe 
lie by a virgin side at four year make one 
though to hold grace with lady he conceal it 
the circumstance and the manner how 
you may hear at better leisure 

how a eunuch 
the more the proof be that be bring to clear thou 
my best Eudoxia the more my sorrow 

that I be innocent 

that I be guilty 
of murder my Eudoxia I will build 
a glorious monument to his memory 
and for my punishment live and die upon it 
and never more converse with man 

live long sir 
may I do so to serve you and if that 
I live do not displease you you owe for it 
to this good lord 

myself and all that be i 

your pardon be a payment 

I be rape 
with joy beyond myself now my Eudoxia 
my jealousy puff away thus in this breath 
I scent the natural sweetness kiss she 

sacred sir 
I be happy to behold this and presume 
now you be please to move a suit in which 
my sister be join with i 

prithee speak it 
for I have vow to hear before I grant 
I thank your good instruction 

it be but this sir 
we have observe the fall out and in 
between the husband and the wise show rare 
their jar and reconcilement strange take we 

anger and jealousy that conclude in kiss 
be a sweet war in sooth 

we therefore brother 
most humble beg you will provide we husband 
that we may taste the pleasure of it 

and with speed sir 
for so your favour be double 

take my word 
I will with all convenience and not blush 
hereafter to be guide by your counsel 
I will deserve your pardon Philanax 
shall be remember and magnificent bounty 
fall on Chrysapius my grace on all 
let Cleon be deliver and reward 
my grace on all which as I lend to you 
return your vow to heaven that it may please 
as it be gracious to quench in i 
all future spark of burn jealousy
