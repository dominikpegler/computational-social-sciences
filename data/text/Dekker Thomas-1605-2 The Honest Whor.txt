yet better lose this hair then lose her soul 

o gentleman so late you be very welcome pray sit down 

Carolo do ere see such a nest of cap 

methinks 
it be a most civil and most comely sight 

what do he in the middle look like 

troth like a spire steeple in a country village overpeer so many thatch house 

it be rather a long pike staff against so many buckler without pike they sit for all the world like a pair of organ and he be the tall great roar pipe in the midst 

ha ha ha ha 

what be that you laugh at signior 

troth shall I tell you and aloud I will tell it 
we laugh to see yet laugh we not in scorn 
among so many cap that long hat wear 

i be as tall a felt as any be this day in Milan and therefore I love it for the block be cleave out for my head and fit i to a hair 

Indeed you be good observer it show strange 
but gentleman I pray neither contemn 
nor yet deride a civil ornament 
I can build so much in the round cap praise

with all our heart 

thus then in the cap honour 
to every sex and state both nature time 
the country law yea and the very clime 
do allot distinct habit the spruce courtier 
jet up and down in silk the warrior 
march in buff the clown plod on in grey 
but for these upper garment thus I say 
the seaman have his cap pare without brim 
the gallant head be feather that fit he 
the soldier have his murrain woman have tire 
beast have their headpiece and man have they 

proceed 

each degree have his fashion it be fit then 
one shall be lay by for the citizen 
and that be the cap which you see swell not high 
for cap be emblem of humility 
it be a citizen badge and first be wear 
by the roman for when any bondman turn 
come to be make a freeman thus it be say 
he to the cap be call that be be make 
of Rome a freeman but be first close shear 
and so a citizen hair be still short wear 

that close shave make barber a company 
and now every citizen use it 

of geometric figure the most rare 
and perfect be the circle and the square 
the city and the school much build upon 
these figure for both love proportion 
the city cap be round the scholar square 
to show that government and learning be 
the perfect limb in the body of a state 
for without they all be disproportionate 
if the cap have no honour this may rear it 
the reverend father of the law do wear it 
it be light for summer and in cold it sit 
close to the scull a warm house for the wit 
it show the whole face bold it be not make 
as if a man to look on it be afraid 
nor like a draper shop with broad dark shed 
for he be no citizen that hide his head 
flat cap as proper be to city gown 
as to armour helmet or to king their crown 
let then the city cap by none be scorn 
since with it prince head have be adorn 
if more the round cap honour you will know 
how will this long gown with this steeple show 

ha ha ha most vile most ugly

I win you to come in

I will try 
if now I can beat down this chastity 
with the same ordnance will you yield this fort 
if with the power of argument now as then 
I get of you the conquest as before 
I turn you honest now to turn you whore 
by force of strong persuasion 

if you can 
I yield 

the alarm be strike up I be your man 

a woman give defiance 

sit 

begin 
it be a brave battle to encounter sin 

you man that be to fight in the same war 
to which I be press and plead at the same bar 
to win a woman if you will have i speed 
send all your wish 

no doubt you be hear proceed 

to be a harlot that you stand upon 
the very name be a charm to make you one 
harlot be a dame of so divine 
and ravish touch that she be concubine 
to a english king her sweet bewitch eye 
do the king heartstring in such loveknot tie 
that even the coy be proud when she can hear 
man say behold another harlot there 
and after her all woman that be fair 
be harlot call as to this day some be 
beside her dalliance she so well do mix 
that she be in latin call the meretrix 
thus for the name for the profession this 
who live in bondage life lace the chief bliss 
this world below can yield be liberty 
and who than whore with loose wing dare fly 
as Juno proud bird spread the fair tail 
so do a strumpet hoist the lofty sail 
she be no man slave man be her slave her eye 
move not on wheel screw up with jealousy 
she horse or coach do merry journey make 
free as the sun in his gild zodiac 
as brave do she shine as fast she be drive 
but stay not long in any house of heaven 
but shift from sign to sign her amorous prize 
more rich be when she be down then when she rise 
in brief gentleman haunt they soldier fight for they 
few man but know they few or none abhor they 
thus for sport sake speak I as to a woman 
who as the worst ground I will turn to common 
but you I will enclose for my own bed 

so shall a husband be dishonour 

dishonour not a whit to fall to one 
beside your husband be to fall to none 
for one no number be 

faith shall you take 
one in your bed will you that reckon make 
it be time you sound retreat 

say have I win 
be the day we 

the battle be but half do 
none but yourself have yet sound alarm 
let we strike too else you dishonour arm 

if you can win the day 
the glory be you 

to prove a woman shall not be a whore 
when she be make she have one man and no more 
yet she be tie to law then for oven then 
it be say she be not make for man but man 
anon to increase earth brood the law be vary 
man shall take many wife and though they marry 
accord to that act yet it be not know 
but that those wife be only tie to one 
new parliament be since for now one woman 
be share between three hundred nay she be common 
common as spot leopard who for sport 
man hunt to get the flesh but care not for it 
So spread they net of gold and tune their call 
to inchant silly woman to take fall 
swear they be angel which that they may win 
they will hire the devil to come with false dice in 
o Siren subtle tune yourselves you flatter 
and our weak sex betray so man love water 
it serve to wash their hand but be once foul 
the water down be pour cast out of door 
and even of such base use do man make whore 
a harlot like a hen more sweetness reap 
to pick man one by one up then in heap 
yet all feed but confound say you shall taste i 
I serve but for the time and when the day 
of war be do be cashier out of pay 
if like lame soldier I can beg that be all 
and there be lust rendezvous a hospital 
who then will be a man slave a man woman 
she be half starve the first day that feed in common 

you shall not feed so but with i alone 

if I drink poison by stealth be it not all one 
be it not rank poison still with you alone 
nay say you spy a courtesan who soft side 
to touch you will sell your birthright for one kiss 
be rack she be win you be sate what follow this 
o than you curse that bawd that tow you in 
the night you curse your lust you loathe the sin 
you loathe her very sight and ere the day 
arise you rise glad when you be steal away 
Even then when you be drink with all her sweet 
there be no true pleasure in a strumpet sheet 
woman who lust so prostitute to sale 
like dancer upon rope once see be stale 

if all the thread of harlot life be span 
so course as you will make they tell i why 
you so long love the trade 

if all the thread 
of harlot life be fine as you will make they 
why do not you persuade your wife turn whore 
and all dame else to fall before that sin 
like a ill husband who I know the same 
to be my undo follow I that game 
o when the work of lust have earn my bread 
to taste it how I tremble lest each bit 
ere it go down shall choke i chew it 
my bed seem like a cabin hang in hell 
the bawd hell porter and the liquorish wine 
the pander fetch be like a easy fine 
for which methinks I lease away my soul 
and oftentimes even in my quaff bowl 
thus say I to myself I be a whore 
and have drink down thus much confusion more 

it be a common rule and it be most true 
two of one trade never love no more do you 
why be you sharp against that you once profess 

why dote you on that which you do once detest 
I can see she be weave of such bad stuff 
set colour on a harlot base enough 
Nothing do make i when I love they best 
to loathe they more than this when in the street 
a fair young modest damsel I do meet 
she seem to all a dove when I pass by 
and I to all a raven every eye 
that follow she wont with a bashful glance 
at i each bold and jeer countenance 
dart forth scorn to she as if she have be 
some tower unvanquished will they veil 
against i swell rumor hoist every sail 
she crown with reverend praise pass by they 
I though with face mask can not escape the hem 
for as if heaven have set strange mark on whore 
because they shall be point stock to man 
dress up in civil shape a courtesan 
let she walk saintlike noteless and unknown 
yet she be betray by some trick of her own 
Were harlot therefore wise they will be sell dear 
for man account they good but for one year 
and then like almanac who date be go 
they be throw by and no more look upon 
who will therefore backward fall who will launch forth 
in sea so foul for venture no more worth 
lust voyage have if not this course this cross 
buy never so cheap your ware come home with loss 
what shall I sound retreat the battle be do 
let the world judge which of we two have win 

I 

you nay then as coward do in fight 
what by blow can shall be save by flight 

fly to earth fix centre to the cave 
of everlasting horror I will pursue thou 
though load with sin even to hell brazen door 
thus wise man turn fool dote on whore 

I beseech your grace though your eye be so pierce as under a poor blue coat to cull out a honest father from a old servingman yet good my lord discover not the plot to any but only this gentleman that be now to be a actor in our ensue comedy 

thou have thy wish Orlando pass unknown 
Sforza shall only go along with thou

I doubt no less 

and it may be my husband 
because when once this woman be unmask 
he level all her thought and make they fit 
now he will mar all again to try his wit 

it may be so too for to turn a harlot 
honest it must be by strong antidote 
it be rare as to see panther change their spot 
and when she be once a star fix and shine bright 
though it be impiety then to dim her light 
because we see such taper seldom burn 
yet it be the pride and glory of some man 
to change she to a blaze star again

if not for fear of law for love to she 
if he love true shall her bed forbear
