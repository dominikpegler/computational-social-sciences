that I die deep in hell most horrid colour 
shall dare to hope for mercy it will leave 
no check or feeling in man innocent 
to catch at sin the devil never teach mankind yet

can borrow all the glorious wing of grace 
my mountainous weight of sin will crack their pinion 
and sink they to hell with i

liberty to the soul when it grow weary 
of this fleshy prison which shall I make choice of 
the fire no I shall feel that hereafter 
the earth will not receive I shall some whirlwind 
snatch i into the air and I hang there 
perpetual plague will dwell upon the earth 
and those superior body that power down 
their cheerful influence deny to pass it 
through those vast region I have infect 
the sea I that be justice there I plough up 
mischief as deep as hell there there I will hide

as far as to confirm the innocent 

your pleasure

and when you have receive it you will think 
too many know it

within our call now sir what burn secret bring you 
with which it seem you be turn cinder 
to quench in my advice or power 

the fire 
will rather reach you 

i 

and consume both 
for it be impossible to be put out 
but with the blood of those that kindle it 
and yet one vial of it be so precious 
it be borrow from the ottoman spring 
that better it be I think both we shall perish 
then prove the desperate mean that must restrain it 
from spread further 

to the point and quick 
these wind circumstance in relation 
seldom environ truth 

truth Asambeg 

truth Mustapha I say it and add more 
you touch upon a string that to my ear 
do sound Donusa 

you then understand 
who it be I aim at 

take heed Mustapha 
remember what she be and who we be 
it be her neglect perhaps that you complain of 
and shall you practise to revenge her scorn 
with any plot to taint she in her honour 

hear i 

I will be hear first there be no tongue 
a subject owe that shall out thunder i 

well take your way 

I then again repeat it 
if Mustapha dare with malicious breath 
on jealous supposition presume 
to blast the blossom of Donusa fame 
because he be deny a happiness 
which man of equal nay of more desert 
have sue in vain for 

more 

more it be I speak it 
the bassa of Anatolia and myself 
be rival for she either of we bring 
more victory more trophy to plead for we 
to our great master than you dare lay claim to 
yet still by his allowance she be leave 
to her election each of we owe nature 
as much for outward form and inward worth 
to make way for we to her grace and favour 
as you bring with you we be hear repulse 
yet think it no dishonour to sit down 
with the disgrace if not to force affection 
may merit such a name 

have you do yet 

be therefore more than sure the ground on which 
you raise your accusation may admit 
no undermine of defence in she 
for if with pregnant and apparent proof 
such as may force a judge more than incline 
or partial in her cause to swear her guilty 
you win not i to set off your belief 
neither our ancient friendship nor the rite 
of sacred hospitality to which 
I will not offer violence shall protect you 
now when you please 

I will not dwell upon 
much circumstance yet can but profess 
with the assurance of a loyalty 
equal to you the reverence I owe 
the sultan and all such his blood make sacred 
that there be not a vein of i which yet be 
unempty in his service but this moment 
shall free open so it may wash off 
the stain of her dishonour can you think 
or though you see it credit your own eye 
that she the wonder and amazement of 
her sex the pride and glory of the empire 
that have disdain you slight i and boast 
a freeze coldness which no appetite 
or height of blood can thaw shall now so far 
be hurry with the violence of her lust 
as in it bury her high birth and fame 
base descend to fill a christian arm 
and to he yield her virgin honour up 
nay sue to he to take it 

a christian 

temper 
your admiration and what Christian think you 
no prince disguise no man of mark nor honour 
no dare undertaker in our service 
but one who lip her foot shall scorn to touch 
a poor mechanicpedlar 

he 

nay more 
who do you think she make her scout nay bawd 
to find he out but i what place make choice of 
to wallow in her foul and loathsome pleasure 
but in the palace who the instrument 
of close conveyance but the captain of 
your guard the aga and that man of trust 
the warden of the inmost port I will prove this 
and though I fail to show she in the act 
glue like a neigh jennet to her stallion 
your incredulity shall be convince 
with proof I blush to think on 

never yet 
this flesh feel such a fever by the life 
and fortune of great Amurath shall our prophet 
who name I bow to in a vision speak this 
it will make i doubtful of my faith lead on 
and when my eye and ear be like you guilty 
my rage shall then appear for I will do 
something but what I be not yet determine 

they be private to their wish

behind this arras 

prithee let we have some sport 
with this fresh codshead

but do as you please my conscience tush the hope 
of liberty throw that burden off 
I must go watch and make discovery

and will talk to himself he can hold 
the poor fool be ravish

indifferent gamester measure we inch by inch 
or weigh we by the standard I may pass 
I have be prove and prove again true mettle

can live again and he be this second Siren 
though bind with cable to his mast his ship too 
fasten with all her anchor this enchantment 
will force he in despite of all resistance 
to leap into the sea and follow she 
although destruction with outstretch arm 
stand ready to receive he 

gentle sir 
though you deny to hear i yet vouchsafe 
to look upon i though I use no language 
the grief for this unkind repulse will print 
such a dumb eloquence upon my face 
as will not only plead but prevail for i 

I be a coward I will see and hear you 
the trial else be nothing nor the conquest 
my temperance shall crown i with hereafter 
worthy to be remember up my virtue 
and holy thought and resolution arm i 
against this fierce temptation give i voice 
tune to a zealous anger to express 
at what a overvalue I have purchase 
the wanton treasure of your virgin bounty 
that in their false fruition heap upon i 
despair and horror that I can with that ease 
redeem my forfeit innocence or cast up 
the poison I receive into my entrails 
from the allure cup of your enticement 
as now I do deliver back the price 

you must grant 
if you hold that a loss to you my equal 
if not transcend it if you then first taste 
that poison as you call it I bring with i 
a palate unacquainted with the relish 
of those delight which most as I have hear 
greedy swallow and then the offence 
if my opinion may be believe 
be not so great however the wrong no more 
than if Hippolitus and the virgin huntress 
shall meet and kiss together 

what defence 
can lust raise to maintain a precipice 

by Mahomet she court he 

nay kneel to he 
observe the scornful villain turn away too 
as glory in his conquest

this stranger be a most religious man sure 
and I be doubtful whether his charity

of a rude prank he do ere he turn pirate

I dare not pity sit and take your place 
however in her life she have degenerate 
may she die noble and in that confirm 
her greatness and high blood 

I now can melt 
but soft compassion leave i

of loose desire find ever such conclusion 
all woman will be vestal 

that you clothe i 
in this sad livery of death assure i 
your sentence be go out before and I 
to late be call for in my guilty cause 
to use qualification or excuse 
yet must I not part so with my own strength 
but borrow from my modesty boldness to 
inquire by who authority you sit 
my judge and who warrant dig my grave 
in the frown you dart against my life 

see here 
this fatal sign and warrant this bring to 
a general fight in the head of his 
victorious troop ravish from his hand 
his even then conquer sword this show unto 
the sultan brother or his son deliver 
his deadly anger and all hope lay by 
command they to prepare themselves for heaven 
which will stand with the quiet of your soul 
to think upon and imitate 

give i leave 
a little to complain first of the hard 
condition of my fortune which may move you 
though not to rise up intercessor for i 
yet in remembrance of my former life 
this be the first spot taint my honour 
to be the mean to bring i to his presence 
and thou I doubt not but I can allege 
such reason in my own defence or plead 
so humble my tear help that it shall 
awake his sleep pity 

it be in vain 
if you have aught to say you shall have hear 
and in i think he present 

I will thus then 
first kneel and kiss his foot and after tell he 
how long I have be his darling what delight 
my infant year afford he how dear 
he prize his sister in both blood my mother 
that she like he have frailty that to i 
descend as a inheritance then conjure he 
by her bless ash and his father soul 
the sword that ride upon his thigh his right hand 
hold the sceptre and the ottoman fortune 
to have compassion on i 

but suppose 
as I be sure he will be deaf what then 
can you infer 

I then will thus rise up 
and to his tooth tell he he be a tyrant 
a most voluptuous and insatiable epicure 
in his own pleasure which he hug so dear 
as proper and peculiar to himself 
that he deny a moderate lawful use 
of all delight to other and to thou 
unequal judge I speak as much and charge thou 
but with impartial eye to look into 
thyself and then consider with what justice 
thou can pronounce my sentence unkind nature 
to make weak woman servant proud man master 
indulgent Mahomet do thy bloody law 
call my embrace with a christian death 
have my heat and may of youth to plead 
in my excuse and yet want power to punish 
these that with scorn break through thy cobweb edict 
and laugh at thy decree to tame their lust 
there be no religious bit let she be fair 
and please to the eye though persian moor 
idolatress Turk or Christian you be privilege 
and free may enjoy she at this instant 
I know unjust man thou have in thy power 
a lovely christian virgin thy offence 
equal if not transcend i why then 
we be both guilty do thou not descend 
from that usurp tribunal and with i 
walk hand in hand to death 

she rave and we 
lose time to hear she read the law 

do do 
I stand resolve to suffer 

if any virgin of what degree or quality soever bear a natural Turk shall be convict of corporal looseness and incontinence with any christian she be by the decree of our great prophet Mahomet to lose her head 

mark that then tax our justice 

ever provide that if she the say offender by any reason argument or persuasion can win and prevail with the say Christian offend with she to alter his religion and marry she that then the win of a soul to the mahometan sect shall acquit she from all shame disgrace and punishment whatsoever 

I lay hold on that clause and challenge from you 
the privilege of the law

grant i access and mean I will undertake 
to turn this christian Turk and marry he 
this trial you can deny 

o base 
can fear to die make you descend so low 
from your high birth and brand the ottoman line 
with such a mark of infamy

a speedy trial if I fail you may 
determine of i as you please

the fond desire of life that like a garment 
cover and clothes our frailty hasten to

with which with your own hand you chain your freedom 
forsake a severe nay imperious mistress 
who service do exact perpetual care 
watch and trouble and give entertainment 
to one that court you who least favour be 
variety and choice of all delight 
mankind be capable of 

you speak in riddle 
what burden or what mistress or what fetter 
be those you point at 

those which your religion 
the mistress you too long have serve compel you 
to bear with slavelike patience 

ha 

how brave 
that virtuous anger show 

be wise and weigh 
the prosperous success of thing if blessing 
be donative from heaven which you must grant 
be blasphemy to question and that 
they be call down and pour on such as be 
most gracious with the great disposer of they 
look on our flourish empire if the splendour 
the majesty and glory of it dim not 
your feeble sight and then turn back and see 
the narrow bound of you yet that poor remnant 
rend in as many faction and opinion 
as you have petty kingdom and then if 
you be not obstinate against truth and reason 
you must confess the deity you worship 
want care or power to help you 

hold out now 
and then thou be victorious 

how he eye her 

as if he will look through her 

his eye flame too 
as threaten violence 

but that I know 
the devil thy tutor fill each part about thou 
and that I can play the exorcist 
to dispossess thou unless I shall tear 
thy body limb by limb and throw it to 
the fury that expect it I will now 
pluck out that wicked tongue that have blaspheme 
that great omnipotency at who nod 
the fabric of the world shake dare you bring 
your juggle prophet in comparison with 
That most inscrutable and infinite essence 
that make this all and comprehend his work 
the place be too profane to mention he 
who only name be sacred o Donusa 
how much in my compassion I suffer 
that thou on who this most excel form 
and faculty of discourse beyond a woman 
be by his liberal gift confer shall still 
remain in ignorance of he that give it 
I will not foul my mouth to speak the sorcery 
of your seducer his base birth his whoredom 
his strange imposture nor deliver how 
he teach a pigeon to feed in his ear 
then make his credulous follower believe 
it be a angel that instruct he 
in the frame of his Alcoran pray you mark i 

these word be death be he in nought else guilty 

your intent to win i 
to be of your belief proceed from 
your fear to die can there be strength in that 
religion that suffer we to tremble 
at that which every day nay hour we haste to 

this be unanswerable and there be something tell i 
I err in my opinion

your constant resolution then you shall 
look true fair when your mind pureness answer 
your onward beauty 

I come here to take you 
but I perceive a yield in myself 
to be your prisoner

or her fair forehead but to you that well 
can do that work of grace I know the viceroy 
will never grant access now in a case 
of this necessity I will glad learn 
whether in i a layman without order 
it may not be religious and lawful 
as we go to our death to do that office 

a question in itself with much ease answer 
midwife upon necessity perform it 
and knight that in the holyland fight for 
the freedom of Jerusalem when full 
of sweat and enemy blood have make their helmet 
the fount out of which with their holy hand 
they draw that heavenly liquor it be approve then 
by the holy church nor must I think it now

the pride and scorn with which she entertain we 
now we be make she by the viceroy gift 
our sweet condition princess fair Donusa 
rest in her death wait on she never use we 
with such contempt I will he have send i 
to the galley or the gallow when he give i 
to this proud little devil 

I expect 
all tyrannous usage but I must be patient 
and though ten time a day she tear these lock 
or make this face her footstool it be but justice 

it be a true story of my fortune father 
my chastity preserve by miracle 
or your devotion for i and believe it 
what outward pride soever I counterfeit 
or state to these appoint to attend i

in his fair life hereafter you must bear too 
your force captivity for it be no better 
though you wear golden fetter and of he

you be still the same good counsellor 

and who know 
since what above be purpose be inscrutable 
but that the viceroy extreme dotage on you 
may be the parent of a happy birth 
than yet our hope dare fashion long conference 
may prove unsafe for you and i however 
perhaps for trial he allow you freedom 

what we command see perform and fail not 
in all thing to be punctual 

we shall sir 

it be strange that you shall use such circumstance 
to a delinquent of so mean condition 

have he appear in a more sordid shape 
then disguise greatness ever deign to mask in 
the gallant bear of his present fortune 
aloud proclaim he noble 

if you doubt he 
to be a man build up for great employment 
and as a cunning spy send to explore 
the city strength or weakness you by torture 
may force he to discover it 

that be base 
nor dare I do such injury to virtue 
and bold assure courage neither can I 
be win to think but if I shall attempt it 
I shoot against the moon he that have stand 
the rough battery that captivity 
can ever bring to shake a constant temper 
despise the fawn of a future greatness 
by beauty in her full perfection tender 
that hear of death as of a quiet slumber 
and from the surplusage of his own firmness 
can spare enough of fortitude to assure 
a feeble woman will now Mustapha 
be alter in his soul for any torment

in the true temper of their mind the one 
a pirate sell to mischief rape and all 
that make a slave relentless and obdurate 
yet of himself want the inward strength 
that shall defend he sink beneath compassion 
or pity of a man where as this merchant 
acquaint only with a civil life 
arm in himself entrench and fortify 
with his own virtue value life and death 
at the same price poor do not invite 
a favour but command we do he right 
which unto he and her we both once honour 
as a just debt I glad pay they they enter 
now sit we equal hearer 

I shall hear 
and see sir without passion my wrong arm i 

a joyful preparation to who bounty

to her mind fortitude shall I but ask 
how she can brook the rough high go sea 
over who foamy back our ship well rige 
with hope and strong assurance must transport we 
nor will I tell she when we reach the haven
