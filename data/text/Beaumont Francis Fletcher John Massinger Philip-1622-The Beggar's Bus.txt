be he then take 

And bring back even now sir 

he be not in disgrace 

no man more love 
nor more deserve it be the only man 
that dare be honest in this court 

Indeed 
we have hear abroad sir that the state have suffer 
a great change since the countess death 

it have sir 

my five year absence have keep i a stranger 
so much to all the occurrent of my country 
as you shall bind i for some short relation 
to make i understand the present time 

I must begin then with a war be make 
and seven year with all cruelty continue 
upon our Flanders by the duke of Brabant 
the cause grow thus during our earl minority 
Woolfort who now usurp be employ thither 
to treat about a match between our earl 
and the daughter and heir of Brabant during which treaty 
the brabander pretend this daughter be 
steal from his court by practice of our state 
though we be all confirm it be a seek quarrel 
to lay a unjust gripe upon this earldom 
it be here believe the duke of Brabant 
have no such loss this war upon it proclaim 
our earl be then a child although his father 
good Gerrard live yet in respect he be 
choose by the countess favour for her husband 
and but a gentleman and Florez hold 
his right unto this country from his mother 
the state think fit in this defensive war 
Woolfort be then the only man of mark 
to make he general 

which place we have hear 
he do discharge with honour 

ay so long 
and with so bless success that the brabander 
be force his treasure waste and the choice 
of his best man of arm tire or cut off 
to leave the field and sound a base retreat 
back to his country but so break both 
in mind and mean ere to make head again 
that hitherto he sit down by his loss 
not dare or for honour or revenge 
again to tempt his fortune but this victory 
more break our state and make a deep hurt 
in Flanders than the great overthrow 
she ever receive for Woolfort now behold 
himself and action in the flatter glass 
of selfdeserving and that cherish by 
the strong assurance of his power for then 
all captain of the army be his creature 
the common soldier too at his devotion 
make so by full indulgence to their rapine 
and secret bounty this strength too well know 
and what it can effect soon put in practice 
as further by the childhood of the earl 
and their improvidence that may have pierce 
the heart of his design give he occasion 
to seize the whole and in that plight you find it 

sir I receive the knowledge of thus much 
as a choice favour from you 

only I must add 
Bruges hold out 

whether sir I be go 
for there last night I have a ship put in 
and my horse wait i Exit

in make you the master of those secret 
which not the rack of conscience can draw from i 
nor I when I ask mercy trust my prayer with 
yet after these assurance of love 
these tie and bond of friendship to forsake i

give i a reason 

sir and so I will 
if I may do it in private and you hear it 

all leave the room you have your will set down 
and use the liberty of our first friendship 

friendship when you prove traitor first that vanish 
nor do I owe you any thought but hate 
I know my flight have forfeit my head 
and so I may make you first understand 
what a strange monster you have make yourself 
I welcome it 

to i this be strange language 

to you why what be you 

your prince and master 
the earl of Flaunders 

by a proper title 
raise to it by cunning circumvention force 
blood and proscription 

and in all this wisdom 
have I not reason when by Gerrard plot 
I shall have first be call to a strict account 
how and which way I have consume that mass 
of money as they term it in the war 
who underhand have by his minister 
detract my great action make my faith 
and loyalty so suspect in which fail 
he seek my life by practice 

with what forehead 
do you speak this to i who as I know it 
must and will say it be false

which I now say you shall not a sound more 
for I that be contemner of my own 
be master of your life then here be a sword 
between you and all aid sir though you blind 
the credulous beast the multitude you pass not 
these gross untruth on i 

how gross untruth 

ay and it be favourable language 
they have be in a mean man lie and foul one 

you take strange licence 

yes be not those rumour 
of be call unto your answer spread 
by your own follower and weak Gerrard wrought 
but by your cunning practice to be believe 
that you be dangerous yet not to be 
punish by any formal course of law 
but first to be make sure and have your crime 
lay open after which your quaint train take 
you flee unto the camp and there crave humble 
protection for your innocent life and that 
since you have escape the fury of the war 
you may not fall by treason and for proof 
you do not for your own end make this danger 
some that have be before by you suborn 
come forth and take their oath they have be hire 
by Gerrard to your murder this once hear 
and easy believe the enrage soldier 
see no further than the outward man 
snatch hasty his arm run to the court 
kill all that make resistance cut in piece 
such as be servant or think friend to Gerrard 
vow the like to he 

will you yet end 

which he foresee with his son the earl 
forsake the city and by secret way 
as you give out and we will glad have it 
escape their fury though it be more than fear 
they fall among the rest nor stand you there 
to let we only mourn the impious mean 
by which you get it but your cruelty since 
so far transcend your former bloody ill 
as if compare they only will appear 
essay of mischief do not stop your ear 
more be behind yet 

o repeat they not 
it be hell to hear they name 

you shall have think 
that hell will be your punishment when you do they 
a prince in nothing but your princely lust 
and boundless rapine 

no more I beseech you 

who be the lord of house or land that stand 
within the prospect of your covetous eye 

you be in this to i a great tyrant 
then ere I be to any 

I end thus 
the general grief now to my private wrong 
the loss of Gerrard daughter Jaqueline 
the hope for partner of my lawful bed 
your cruelty have fright from my arm 
and she I now be wander to recover 
think you that I have reason now to leave you 
when you be grow so just odious 
that even my stay here with your grace and favour 
make my life irksome here sure take it 
and do i but this fruit of all your friendship 
that I may die by you and not your hangman 

o Hubert these your word and reason have 
as well draw drop of blood from my grieve heart 
as these tear from my eye 
despise they not 
by all that be sacred I be serious Hubert 
you now have make i sensible what fury 
whip hangman and tormentor a bad man 
do ever bear about he let the good 
that you this day have do be ever number 
the first of your best action 
can you think 
where Florez be or Gerrard or your love 
or any else or all that be proscribe 
I will resign what I usurp or have 
unjust force the day I have to live 
be too too few to make they satisfaction 
with any penitence yet I vow to practise 
all of a man 

o that your heart and tongue 
do not now differ 

by my grief they do not 
nake the good pain to search they out it be worth it 
you have make clean a leper trust i you have 
and make i once more fit for the society 
I hope of good man 

sir do not abuse 
my aptness to believe 

suspect not you 
a faith that be build upon so true a sorrow 
make your own safety ask they all the tie 
humanity can give Hemskirk too shall 
along with you to this so wish discovery 
and in my name profess all that you promise 
and I will give you this help to it I have 
of late receive certain intelligence 
that some of they be in or about Bruges 
to be find out which I do then interpret 
the cause of that town stand out against i 
but now be glad it may direct your purpose 
of give they their safety and i peace 

be constant to your goodness and you have it Ex 

it be much that you deliver of this Goswin 

but short of what I can yet have the country 
confirm it true and by a general oath 
and not a man hazard his credit in it 
he bear himself with such a confidence 
as if he be the master of the sea 
and not a wind upon the sailor compass 
but from one part or other be his factor 
to bring he in the best commodity 
merchant ever venture for 

it be strange 

and yet 
this do in he deserve the least of wonder 
compare with other his peculiar fashion 
which all admire he be young and rich at least 
thus far repute so that since he live 
in Bruges there be never bring to harbour 
so rich a bottom but his bill will pass 
unquestioned for her lade 

yet he still 
continue a good man 

so good that but 
to doubt he will be hold a injury 
or rather malice with the best that traffic 
but this be nothing a great stock and fortune 
crown his judgement in his undertake 
may keep he upright that way but that wealth 
shall want the power to make he dote on it 
or youth teach he to wrong it best commend 
his constant temper for his outward habit 
it be suitable to his present course of life 
his table furnish well but not with dainty 
that please the appetite only for their rareness 
or the dear price nor give to wine or woman 
beyond his health or warrant of a man 
I mean a good one and so love his state 
he will not hazard it at play nor lend 
upon the assurance of a wellpenned letter 
although a challenge second the denial 
from such as make the opinion of their valour 
their mean of feed 

these be way to thrive 
and the mean not curse 

what follow this 
make many venturer with he in their wish 
for his prosperity for when desert 
or reason lead he to be liberal 
his noble mind and ready hand contend 
which can add most to his free courtesy 
or in their worth or speed to make they so 
be there a virgin of good fame want dowry 
he be a father to she or a soldier 
that in his country service from the war 
have bring he only scar and want his house 
receive he and relieve he with that care 
as if what he possess have be lay up 
for such good use and he steward of it 
but I shall lose myself to speak he further 
and stale in my relation the much good 
you may be witness of if your remove 
from brugis be not speedy 

this report 
I do assure you will not hasten it 
nor will I wish a better man to deal with 
for what I be to part with 

never doubt it 
he be your man and we only I wish 
his too much forwardness to embrace all bargain 
suck he not in the end 

have better hope 
for my part I be confident here he come 

I take it at your own rate your wine of Cyprus 
but for your candy sugar they have meet 
with such foul weather and be prize so high 
I can save in they 

I be unwilling 
to seek another chapman make i offer 
of something near my price that may assure i 
you can deal for they 

I both can and will 
but not with too much loss your bill of lade 
speak of two hundred chest value by you 
at thirty thousand gilder I will have they 
at twenty eight so in the payment of 
three thousand sterling you fall only in 
two hundred pound 

you know they be so cheap 

why look you I will deal fair there be in prison 
and at your suit a pirate but unable 
to make you satisfaction and past hope 
to live a week if you shall prosecute 
what you can prove against he set he free 
and you shall have your money to a stiver 
and present payment 

this be above wonder 
a merchant of your rank that have at sea 
so many bottom in the danger of 
these waterthief shall be a mean to save they 
it more import you for your own safety 
to be at charge to scour the sea of they 
then stay the sword of justice that be ready 
to fall on one so conscious of his guilt 
that he dare not deny it 

you mistake i 
if you think I will cherish in this captain 
the wrong he do to you or any man 
I be late with he have first from other 
true testimony be assure a man 
of more desert never put from the shore 
I read his letter of mart from this state grant 
for the recovery of such loss as 
he have receive in Spain it be that he aim at 
not at three tun of wine biscuit or beef 
which his necessity make he take from you 
if he have pillage you near or sink your ship 
or throw your man overboard than he deserve 
the law extreme rigour but since want 
of what he can not live without compel he 
to that he do which yet our state call death 
I pity his misfortune and to work you 
to some compassion of they I come up 
to your own price save he the good be i 
if not seek elsewhere I will not deal for they 

well sir for your love I will once be lead 
to change my purpose 

for your profit rather 

I will present make mean for his discharge 
till when I leave you

as of a deed of noble pity guide 
by a strong judgement
