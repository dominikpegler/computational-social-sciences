good day to your lordship 

thank Adorni 

may I presume to ask if the ambassador 
employ by Ferdinand the duke of Urbin 
have audience this morning 

it be uncertain 
for though a counsellor of state I be not 
of the cabinet counsel but there be one if he please 
that may resolve you 

I will move he sir 

if you have a suit show water I be blind else 

a suit yet of a nature not to prove 
the quarry that you hawk for if your word 
be not like indian ware and every scruple 
to be weigh and rate one poor syllable 
vouchsafe in answer of a fair demand 
can deserve a fee 

it seem you be ignorant 
I neither speak nor hold my peace for nothing 
and yet for once I care not if I answer 
one single question gratis 

I much thank you 
have the ambassador audience sir today 

yes 

at what hour 

I promise not so much 
a syllable you beg my charity give it 
move i no further 

This you wonder at 
with i it be usual 

pray you sir what be he 

a gentleman yet no lord he have some drop 
of the king blood run in his vein derive 
some ten degree off his revenue lie 
in a narrow compass the king ear and yield he 
every hour a fruitful harvest Men may talk 
of three crop in a year in the fortunate island 
or profit make by wool but while there be suitor 
his sheep shear nay shave to the quick 
be in every quarter of the moon and constant 
in the time of truss a point he can undo 
or make a man his play or recreation 
be to raise this up or pull down that and though 
he neve yet take order make more bishop 
in Sicily than the pope himself 

most strange 

the presence fill he in the Malta habit 
be the natural brother of the king a by blow 

I understand you 

morrow to my uncle 

and my late guardian but at length I have 
the reign in my own hand 

pray you use they well 
or you will too late repent it 

with this jewel 
present to Camiola prepare 
this night a visit for i I shall have 
your company gallant I perceive if that 
the king will hear of war 

sir I have horse 
of the best breed in Naples fit far 
to break a rank then crack a lance and be 
in their career of such incredible swiftness 
they outstrip swallow 

and such may be useful 
to run away with shall we be defeat 
you be well provide signior 

sir excuse i 
all of their race by instinct know a coward 
and scorn the burden they come on like lightning 
founder in a retreat 

by no mean back they 
unless you know your courage sympathize 
with the dare of your horse 

my lord this be bitter 

I will raise i a company of foot 
and when at push of pike I be to enter 
a breach to show my valour I have buy i 
a armour cannon proof 

you will not leap then 
over a outwork in your shirt 

I do not like 
activity that way 

you have rather stand 
a mark to try their musket on 

if I do 
no good I will do no hurt 

it be in you signior 
a christian resolution and become you 
but I will not discourage you 

you be sir 
a knight of Malta and as I have hear 
have serve against the Turk 

it be true 

pray you show we 
the difference between the city valour 
and service in the field 

it be somewhat more 
than roar in a tavern or a brothel 
or to steal a constable from a sleep watch 
then burn their halberd or safe guard by 
your tenant son to carry away a maypole 
from a neighbour village you will not find there 
your master of dependency to take up 
a drunken brawl or to get you the name 
of valiant chevalier fellow that will be 
for a cloak with thrice die velvet and a cast suit 
kick down the stair a knave with half a britch there 
and no shirt be a thing superfluous 
and wear out of his memory if you bear not 
yourselves both in and upright with a provant sword 
will slash your scarlet and your plush a new way 
or with the hilt thunder about your ear 
such music as will make your worship dance 
to the doleful tune of Lachryma 

I must tell you 
in private as you be my princely friend 
I do not like such fiddler 

no they be useful 
for your imitation I remember you 
when you come first to the court and talk of nothing 
but you rent and your entrada ever chime 
the golden bell in your pocket you believe 
the take of the wall as a tribute due to 
your gaudy clothes and can not walk at midnight 
without a causeless quarrel as if man 
of courser outside be in duty bind 
to suffer your affront but when you have be 
cudgel well twice or thrice and from the doctrine 
make profitable use you conclude 
the sovereign mean to teach irregular heir 
civility with conformity of manner 
be two or three sound beat 

I confess 
they do much good upon i 

and on i the principle that they read be sound 

you will find 
the like instruction in the camp 

the king 

we sit prepare to hear 

your majesty 
have be long since familiar I doubt not 
with the desperate fortune of my lord and pity 
of the much that your confederate have suffer 
you be his last refuge may persuade you 
not alone to compassionate but to lend 
your royal aid to stay he in his fall 
to certain ruin he too late be conscious 
that his ambition to encroach upon 
his neighbour territory with the danger of 
his liberty nay his life have borough in question 
his own inheritance but youth and heat 
of blood in your interpretation may 
both plead and mediate for he I must grant it 
a error in he be deny the favour though 
of the fair princess of Sienna 
he seek she in a noble way to endeavour 
to force affection by surprisal of 
her principal seat Sienna 

which now prove 
the seat of his captivity not triumph 
heaven be still just 

and yet that justice be 
to be with mercy temper which heaven deputy 
stand bind to minister the injure Duchess 
by reason teach as nature can not with 
the reparation of her wrong but aim at 
a brave revenge and my lord feel too late 
that innocence will find friend the great Gonzaga 
the honour of his order I must praise 
virtue though in a enemy he who fight 
and conquest hold one number rally up 
her scatter troop before we can get time 
to victual or to man the conquer city 
sit down before it and presume that 
it be not to be relieve admit no parley 
our flag of truce hang out in vain nor will he 
lend a ear to composition but exact 
with the render up the own the good and line 
of all within the wall and of all sex 
to be at his discretion 

since injustice 
in your duke meet this correction can you press we 
with any seem argument of reason 
in foolish pity to decline his danger 
to draw they on ourself shall we not be 
warn by his harm the league proclaim between we 
bind neither of we far than to aid 
each other if by foreign force invade 
and so far in my honour I be tie 
but since without our counsel or allowance 
he have take arm with his good leave he must 
excuse we if we steer not on a rock 
we see and may avoid let other monarch 
contend to be make glorious by proud war 
and with the blood of their poor subject purchase 
increase of empire and augment their care 
in keep that which be by wrong extort 
guild unjust invasion with the trim 
of glorious conquest we that will be know 
the father of our people in our study 
and vigilance for their safety must not change 
their ploughshare into sword or force they from 
the secure shade of their own vine to be 
scorch with the flame of war or for our sport 
expose their life to ruin 

will you then 
in his extremity forsake your friend 

no but preserve ourself 

can the beam 
of honour thaw your icy fear 

who be that 

a kind of brother sir however your subject 
your father son and one who blush that 
you be not heir to his brave spirit and vigour 
as to his kingdom 

how be this 

sir to be 
his live chronicle and to speak his praise 
can deserve your anger 

where be your warrant 
for this presumption 

here sir in my heart 
let sycophant that feed upon your favour 
style coldness in you caution and prefer 
your ease before your honour and conclude 
to eat and sleep supine be the end 
of humane blessing I must tell you sir 
virtue if not in action be a vice 
and when we move not forward we go backward 
nor be this peace the nurse of drone and coward 
our health but a disease 

well urge my lord 

perfect what be so well begin 

and bind 
my lord your servant 

harebrained fool what reason 
can thou infer to make this good 

a thousand 
not to be contradict but consider 
where your command lie it be not sir in France 
Spain Germany Portugal but in Sicily 
a island sir here be no mine of gold 
or silver to enrich you no worm spin 
silk in her womb to make distinction 
between you and a peasant in your habit 
no fish live near our shore who be blood can die 
scarlet or purple all that we possess 
with beast we have in common nature do 
design we robe warrior and to break through 
our ring the sea by which we be environ 
and we by force must fetch in what be want 
or precious to we add to this we be 
a populous nation and increase so fast 
that if we by our providence be not send 
abroad in colony or fall by the sword 
not Sicily though now it be more fruitful 
then when it be style the granary of great rome 
can yield our numerous fry bread we must starve 
or eat up one another 

the king hear 
with much attention 

And seem move with what 
Bertoldo have deliver 

may you live long sir 
the king of peace so you deny not we 
the glory of the war let not our nerve 
shrink up with sloth nor for want of employment 
make young brother thief it be their sword sir 
must sow and reap their harvest if example 
may move you more than argument look on England 
the empress of the european isle 
and unto who alone we yield precedence 
when do she flourish so as when she be 
the mistress of the ocean her navy 
put a girdle round about the world 
when the iberian quake her worthy name 
and the fair flower Deluce grow pale set by 
the red rose and the white let not our armour 
hang up or our unrigged armada make we 
ridiculous to the late poor snake our neighbour 
warm in our bosom and to who again 
we may be terrible while we spend our hour 
without variety confine to drink 
dice card or whore rouse we sir from the sleep 
of idleness and redeem our mortgage honour

upon the king
