no news no tiding of they Ephraim ha 
be even such a escape 

not since the rape 
of Helen I be persuade I have search 
with narrow eye as I may say with care 
and diligence in most secret place 
and can no way inform myself what be 
betide of the young damosel or old squire 
your niece and the french virgin and the man 
unworthy to be call your brother Strigood 

o hang he villain 

doubtless it be his plot 
to work upon your ladyship good nature 
to harbour they that he may take the advantage 
of steal they away 

what to do ha 

to do much may be do by his seducement 
on two such tender virgin though he shall 
but plant they in our suburb but my fear 
be that he have transport they beyond sea 
into some nunnery your ladyship 
know he be adverse in religion 

I know he be of none 

Satan will work 
the strong in he then to their subversion 

how shall I answer now my brother Matchil 
but he be just serve to marry so 
the thought of it torment i where be my comfort 
where be Nehemiah ha 

he be busy madam 

what at his book or at his music ha 

that be his ballet or his Jew trump no 
madam he be busy at his exercise of arm 
with a new cast top a cat and catstick 
I buy and bring he home 

I thank you for they 
my careful discreet Ephraim I like 
his harmless exercise well 

I hope 
your ladyship can say since I have have 
the government of he under your ladyship 
I have be careful of the gentleman 
and have his love withal so much that I 
dare say I hope you will pardon the comparison 
that have you marry i which be as likely 
as that your brother will have take his maid 
I think that mr Nehemiah will not 
have run away in hatred of our match 
as mrs Joyce it seem have do of they 
I hope your ladyship pardon I understand 
my duty 

and you speak but reason Ephraim 

I have give she there a touch of my affection 
who know how it may work

it be a good care and madam by the way 
let i advise that since his ripe year 
require and that fair proposition 
of marriage be tender for he that 
we gentle by degree do take he off 
from childish exercise indeed plain boy play 
more manly will become he 

you will have he 
do worse then will you and be nought you varlet
