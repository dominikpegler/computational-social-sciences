ah nurse sweet Sophos be the man 
who love be lock in Lelia tender breast 
this heart have vow if heaven do not deny 
my love with his entomb in earth shall lie 

peace mistress stand aside here come somebody 

optatis non est spes ulla potiri 
yet Phoebus send down thy tralucent beam 
behold the earth that mourn in sad attire 
the flower at Sophos presence begin to droop 
who trickle tear for Lelia loss 
do turn the plain into a stand pool 
sweet Cynthia smile cheer up the droop flower 
let Sophos once more see a sunshine day 
oh let the sacred centre of my heart 
I mean fair Lelia nature fair work 
be once again the object to my eye 
o but I wish in vain while she I wish to see 
her father he obscure she from my sight 
he plead my want of wealth 
and say it be a bar in Venus court 
How have fond fortune by her fatal doom 
predestine i to live in hapless hope 
still turn false her fickle waver wheel 
And love fair goddess with her circian cup 
enchant so fond Cupid poison dart 
that love the only lodestar of my life 
do draw my thought into a labyrinth 
but stay 
what do I see what do my eye behold 
oh happy sight it be fair Lelia face 
hail heaven bright nymph the period of my grief 
sole guidress of my thought and author of my joy 

sweet Sophos welcome to Lelia 
fair Dido carthaginian beauteous queen 
not half so joyful be whenas the trojan prince 
Aeneas land on the sandy shore 
of Carthage confine as thy Lelia be 
to see she Sophos here arrive by chance 

And bless be chance that have conduct i unto the place where I may see my dear 
as dear to i as be the dear life 

sir you may see that fortune be your friend 

yet fortune favour fool 

by that conclusion you shall not be wife 

foul fortune sometime smile on virtue fair 

it be then to show her mutability 
but since amid ten thousand frown threat 
of fickle fortune thrice unconstant wheel 
she deign to show one little please smile 
let we do our best false fortune to beguile 
and take advantage of she ever change mood 
see see how tellus spangle mantle smile 
and bird do chant their rural sugar note 
as ravish with our meeting sweet delight 
since then their fit for love both time and place 
let love and like hand in hand embrace 

sir the next way to win her love be to linger her leisure 
I measure my mistress by my lovely self make a promise to a man and keep it I have but one fault I near make promise in my life but I stick to it tooth and nail I will pay it home i'faith 
if I promise my love a kiss I will give he two marry at first I will make nice and cry fie fie and that will make he come again and again 
I will make he break his wind with come agains 

but what say Lelia to her Sophos love 

ah Sophos that fond blind boy 
that wring these passion from my Sophos heart 
have likewise wound Lelia with his dart 
and force perforce I yield the fortress up 
here Sophos take thy Lelia hand 
and with this hand receive a loyal heart 
high jove that rule heaven bright canopy 
grant to our love a wish felicity 

as joy the weary pilgrim by the way 
when Phoebus wave unto the western deep 
to summon he to his desire rest 
or as the poor distress mariner 
long toss by shipwreck on the foam wave 
at length behold the long wish haven 
although from far his heart do dance for joy 
so love consent at length my mind have ease 
my trouble thought by sweet content be please 

my father reck not virtue 
but vow to wed i to a man of wealth 
and swear his gold shall counterpoise his worth 
but Lelia scorn proud Mammon golden mine 
and better like of learning sacred lore 
then of fond fortune glister mockery 
but Sophos try thy wit and use thy utmost skill 
to please my father and compass his good will 

to what fair Lelia will do Sophos yield content 
yet that be the troublous gulf my silly ship must pass 
but be that venture hard to achieve 
then that of jason for the golden fleece 
I will effect it for sweet Lelia sake 
or leave myself as witness of my thought 

How say you by that mistress he will do any thing for your sake 

thank gentle love 
but least my father shall suspect 
who jealous head with more than Argus eye 
do measure every gesture that I use 
I will in and leave you here alone 
adieu sweet friend until we meet again 
come nurse follow i 

farewell my love fair fortune be thy guide 
now Sophos now bethink thyself 
how thou may win she father will to knit this happy knot 
Alas thy state be poor thy friend be few 
and fear forbid to tell my fate to friend 
well I will try my fortune 
and find out some convenient time 
whenas her father leisure best shall serve 
to confer with he about fair Lelia love

o I will sir 

Mas the fellow be afraid 
I play the bugbear wheresoever I come 
and make they all afraid 
but here come master churm 

fellow Robin God save you I have be seek for you in every alehouse in the town 

what master churm what be the best news abroad it be long since I see you 

faith little news but yet I be glad I have meet with you 
I have a matter to impart to you wherein you may stand i in some stead and make a good benefit to yourself if we can deal cunning it will be worth a double fee to you by the lord 

a double fee speak man what be it 
if it be to betray my own father I will do it for half a fee 
and for cunning let i alone 

why then this it be 
here be master gripe hard by a client of i a man of mighty wealth who have but one daughter her dowry be her weight in gold 
now sir this old penny father will marry she to one Peter Ploddall rich ploddall son and heir 
who though his father mean to leave very rich 
yet he be a very idiot and brown bread clown 
and one I know the wench do deadly hate 
and though their friend have give their full consent 
and both agree on this unequal match 
yet I know that Lelia will never marry he 
but there be another rival in her love one Sophos 
and he be a scholar 
one who I think fair Lelia dear love 
but her father hate he as he hate a toad 
for he be in want and gripe gape after gold 
and still rely upon the old say see 
si nihil attuleris etc 

and wherein can I do you good in this 

marry thus sir 
I be of late grow pass familiar with M gripe 
and for Ploddall he take i for his second self 
now sir I will fit myself to the old crummy churl humour and make they believe I will persuade Lelia to marry Peter Ploddall and so get free access to the wench at my pleasure 
now oath other side I will fall in with the scholar and he I will handle cunning too 
I will tell he that Lelia have acquaint i with her love to he 
and for because her father much suspect the same 
he mew she up as man do mew their hawk 
and so restrain she from her Sophos sight 
I will say because she do repose more trust 
of secrecy in i then in another man 
in courtesy she have request i 
to do her kind greeting to her love 

a excellent devise i'faith 

I sir and by this mean I will make a very gull of my fine Diogenes 
I shall know his secret even from the very bottom of his heart 
nay more sir you shall see i deal so cunning that he shall make i a instrument to compass his desire 
when God know I mean nothing less 
Qui nescit dissimulare nescit vivere 

why this will be sport alone 
but what will you have i do in this action 

marry as I play with to hand play you with other 
fall you aboard with Peter Ploddall 
make he believe you will work miracle 
and that you have a powder will make Lelia love he 
nay what will he not believe and take all that come you know my mind 
and so we will make a gull of the one and a goose of the other 
and if we can invent any devise to bring the scholar in disgrace with she I do not doubt but with your help to creep between the bark and the tree and get Lelia myself 

tush man I have a devise in my head already to do that 
but they say her brother Fortunatus love he dear 

Tuthees out of the country 
he follow the drum and the flag 
he may chance to be kill with a double canon before he come home again 
but what be your devise 

marry I will do this 
I will frame a indictment against Sophos in manner and form of a rape and the next law day you shall prefer it that so Lelia may loathe he 
her father still deadly hate he 
and the young gallant her brother utter forsake he 

but how shall we prove it 

sound we will hire some strumpet or other to be swear against he 

now by the substance of my soul it be a excellent devise 
well let we in I will first try my cunning otherwise and if all fail we will try this conclusion 

i'faith Margot you must even take your daughter Peg home again 
for she will not be rule by i 

why mother what will she not do 

faith she neither do nor do nor will do any thing 
send she tuth market with egg she will sell they and spend the money

and thank God here be a fine weather for my father lamb 

I can live content in discontent 
for as no music can delight the ear 
where all the part of discord be compose

I can love

thus lucre set in golden chair of state 
when learning be bid stand by and keep a loof 
this greedy humour fit my father vain 
who gape for nothing but for golden gain 

mistress take heed you speak nothing that will bear action for here come master churm the pettifogger 

mistress Lelia rest you merry 
what be the reason you and your nurse walk here all alone 

because sir we desire no other company but our own 

will I be then your own 
that I may keep you company 

o sir you and he that be her own be far asunder 

but if she please we may be near 

that can be my own be near than myself 
and yet myself alas be not my own 
thought fear despair ten thousand dreadful dream 
those be my own and these do keep i company 

before God I must confess your father be too cruel 
to keep you thus sequester from the world 
to spend your prime of youth thus in obscurity 
and seek to wed you to a idiot fool 
that know not how to use himself 
can my desert but answer my desire 
I swear by sol fair Phoebus silver eye 
my heart will wish no high to aspire 
than to be grace with Lelia love 
by jesus I can play the dissembler 
and woo my love with court ambage 
like one who love hang on his smooth tongue end 
but in a word I tell the sum of my desire 
I love fair Lelia 
by she my passion daily be increase 
and I must die unless by Lelia love they be release 

why master churm I have think you have be my father great counsellor in all these action 

nay damn i if I be 
by heaven sweet nymph I be not 

master churm you be one can do much with her father and if you love she as you say persuade he to use she more kind and give her liberty to take her choice for these make marriage prove not well 

I protest I will 

so Lelia shall accept thou as her friend 
meanwhile nurse let we in 
my long absence I know will make my father muse 

so Lelia shall accept thou as her friend 
who can but ruminate upon these word 
will she have say her love 
but it be no matter first creep and then go 
now her friend the next degree be Lelia love 
well I will persuade her father to let she have a little more liberty 
but soft I will none of that neither 
so the scholar may chance cousin i 
persuade he to keep she in still 
and fore she will have Peter Ploddall she will have anybody and so I shall be sure that Sophos shall never come at she 
why I will warrant you she will be glad to run away with i at length 
hang he that have no shift 
I promise Sophos to further he in his suit 
but if I do I will be peck to death with hen 
I swear to gripe I will persuade Lelia to love Peter Ploddall 
but God forgive i it be the further end of my thought 
tut what be a oath every man for himself 
I will shift for one I warrant you 

thus have I pass the beat billow of the sea 
by ithac rock and watery Neptune bound 
and waft safe from mar his bloody field 
where trumpet sound tantara to the fight 
and here arrive for to repose myself 
upon the border of my native soil 
now Fortunatus bend thy happy course 
unto thy father house to greet thy dear friend 
and if that still thy age sire survive 
thy presence will revive his droop spirit 
and cause his wither cheek be sprent with youthful blood 
where death of late be portray to the quick 
but soft who come here 

I wonder I hear not of master churm 
I will fain know how he speed 
and what success he have in Lelia love 
well if he cozen the scholar of she 
it will make my worship laugh 
and if he have her he may say god a mercy Robin Goodfellow 
o wear a good head as long as you live 
why master gripe he cast beyond the moon 
and churm be the only man he put in trust with his daughter and I will warrant the old churl will take it upon his salvation that he will persuade she to marry Peter Ploddall 
but I will make a fool of Peter Ploddall 
I will look he in the face and pick his purse 
while churm cousin he of his wench 
and my old grandsire holdfast of his daughter 
and if he can do so 
I will teach he a trick to cozen he of his gold too 
now for Sophos let he wear the willow garland 
and play the melancholy malcontent 
and pluck his hat down in his sullen eye 
and think on Lelia in these desert grove 
it be enough for he to have she in his thought 
although he never embrace she in his arm 
but now there be a fine devise come in my head 
to scar the scholar 
you shall see I will make fine sport with he 
they say that every day he keep his walk 
among these wood and melancholy shade 
and on the bark of every senseless tree 
in grave the tenor of his hapless hope 
now when he be at Venus altar at his orison 
I will put i on my great carnation nose 
and wrap i in a rouse calfskin suit 
and come like some hob goblin or some devil 
ascend from the grief pit of hell 
and like a scarbabe make he take his leg 
I will play the devil I warrant you 

and if you do by this hand I will play the conjurer 
blush Fortunatus at thy base conceit 
to stand aloof like one that be in a trance 
and with thy eye behold that miscreant imp 
who tongue more venom than the serpent sting 
before thy face thus taunt thy dear friend 
I thy own father with reproachful term 
thy sister Lelia she be buy and sell 
and learned Sophos thy thrice vow friend 
be make a stale by this base curse crew 
and damn den of vagrant run agate 
but here in sight of sacred heaven I swear 
by all the sorrow of the stygian soul 
by mar his bloody blade and fair Bellona bower 
I vow these eye shall never behold my father face 
these foot shall never pass these desert plain 
but pilgrim like I will wander in these wood 
until I find out Sophos secret walk 
and sound the depth of all their plot drift 
nor will I cease until these hand revenge 
the injurious wrong that be offer to my friend 
upon the worker of this stratagem

but beshrew my heart I be afraid that Lelia will have yield when I see her father take she by the hand and call i for a witness my heart begin to quake 
but to say the truth she have little reason to take a cullian lugloaf milksop stave 
when she may have a lawyer a gentleman that stand upon his reputation in the country 
one who diminutive defect of law may compare with his little learning 
well I see that churme must be the man must carry Lelia when all be do 

how now master churme what news abroad methinks you look very spruce you be very frolic now a late 

what fellow Robin how go the square with you

and I will come over he again and again I warrant you 

faith Lelia have even give he the doff off here and have make her father almost stark mad

but I be in very good hope 

but do you think you shall get her father good will

that will come afterward 
and I will be sure of something in the mean time 
for I have outlaw a great number of his debtor 
and I will gather up what money I can among they 
and gripe shall never know of it neither 

ay and of those that be scarce able to pay 
take the one half and forgive they the other rather than sit out at all 

tush let i alone for that 
but sirrah I have bring the scholar into a fool paradise 
why he have make i his spokesman to M Lelia 
and god my judge I never so much as name he to she 

o by the mass well remember 
I will tell you what I mean to do 
I will attire myself fit for the same purpose 
like to some hellish hag or damn fiend 
and meet with Sophos wander in the wood 
oh I shall fray he terrible 

I will thou can scar he out of his wit 
then shall I have the wench cock sure 
I doubt nobody but he 

well let we go drink together 
and then I will go put on my devilish robe 
I mean my Christmas calf skin suit 
and then walk to the wood 
oh I will terrify he I warranty 

will heaven still smile at Sophos misery 
and give no end to my uncessant moan 
these cypress shade be witness of my woe 
the senseless tree do grieve at my lament 
the leafy branch drop sweet Myrrha tear 
for love do scorn i in my mother womb 
and sullen Saturn pregnant at my birth 
with all the fatal star conspire in one 
to frame a hapless constellation 
presage Sophos luckless destiny 
here here do Sophos turn Ixion restless wheel 
and here lie wrap in labyrinth of love 
of his sweet Lelia love who sole idea still 
prolong the hapless date of Sophos hopeless life 
ah say I life a life far worse than death 
then death i then ten thousand death 
I daily die in that I live love thrall 
they die thrice happy that once die for all 
here will I stay my weary wander step 
and lay i down upon this solid earth he lie down 
the mother of despair and baleful thought 
ay this befit my melancholy mood 
now now methinks I hear the pretty bird 
with warble tune record fair Lelia name 
who absence make warm blood drop from my heart 
and force watery tear from these my weep eye 
methinks I hear the silver sound stream 
with gentle murmur summon i to sleep 
sing a sweet melodious lullaby 
here will I take a nap and drown my hapless hope 
in the ocean sea of never like to speed 

thus have Sylvanus leave his leafy bower 
draw by the sound of echo sad report 
that with shrill note and high resound voice 
do pierce the very cavern of the earth 
and ring through hill and dale the sad lament 
of virtue loss and Sophos mournful plaint 
now Morpheus rouse thou from thy sable den 
charm all his sense with a slumber trance 
while old Sylvanus send a lovely train 
of satyr dryad and watery nymph 
out of their bower to tune their silver string 
and with sweet sound music sing 
some please madrigal and rondelay 
to comfort Sophos in his deep distress 

what do I hear what harmony be this 
with silver sound that glut Sophos ear 
and drive sad passion from his heavy heart 
presage some good future hap shall fall 
after these bluster blast of discontent 
thank gentle nymph and satyr too adieu 
that thus compassionate a loyal lover woe 
when heaven sit smile at his dire mishap 

with weary step I trace these desert grove 
and search to find out Sophos secret walk 
my true vow friend and Lelia dear love 
Soph what voice be this sound Lelia sacred name he rise 
be it some satire that have view she late 
and b grow enamour of her gorgeous hue 

no satire Sophos but thy ancient friend 
who dear blood do rest at thy command 
have sorrow late blear thy watery eye 
that thou forget the last league of love 
long since be vow betwixt thyself and i 
look on i man I be thy friend 
Sophos o now I know thou now thou name my friend 
I have no friend to who I dare 
unload the burden of my grief 
but only Fortunatus he be my second self 
mi Fortunateter Fortunate venis 

how fare my friend methinks you look not well 
your eye be sink your cheek look pale and wan 
what mean this alteration 

my mind sweet friend be like a mastless ship 
that be huld and toss upon the surge sea 
by boreas bitter blast and Aeolus whistle wind 
on rock and sand far from the wish port 
whereon my silly ship desire to land 
fair Lelia love that be the wish haven 
wherein my wander mind will take repose 
for want of which my restless thought be toss 
for want of which all Sophos joy be lose 

do Sophos love my sister Lelia 

she she it be who love I wish to gain 
nor need I wish nor do I love in vain 
my love she do repay with equal meed 
it be strange you will say that Sophos shall not speed 

your love repay with equal meed 
and yet you languish still in love it be strange 
from whence proceed your grief unfold unto your friend 
a friend may yield relief 

my want of wealth be author of my grief 
your father say my state be too too low 
I be no hobby breed I may not soar so high as Lelia love 
the lofty eagle will not catch at fly 
when I with Icarus will soar against the sun 
he be the only fiery Phaeton deny my course 
and fear my waxen wing whenas I soar aloft 
he mew fair Lelia up from Sophos sight 
that not so much as paper plead remorse 
thrice three time Sol have sleep in Thetis lap 
since these my eye behold sweet Lelia face 
what great grief what other hell than this 
to be deny to come where my belove be 

do you alone love Lelia 
have you no rival with you in your love 

yes only one and he your father back 
it be Peter Ploddall rich ploddall son and heir 
one who base rustic rude desert 
unworthy far to win so fair a prize 
yet mean your father for to mart a match 
for golden lucre with this Corydon 
and scorn at virtue lore hence grow my grief 

if it be true I hear there be one churm beside 
make suit to win my sister to his bride 

that can be Churms it my vow friend 
who tongue relate the tenor of my love 
to Lelia ear I have no other mean 

well trust he not the tiger hide his claw 
when oft he do pretend the great guile 
but stay here come Lelia nurse 

nurse what news

and her father oath other side he yole at she and iole at she and she lead such a life for you it pass and you will neither come to she nor send to she 
why she think you have forget she 

nay then let heaven in sorrow end my day 
and fatal fortune never cease to frown 
and heaven and earth and all conspire to pull i down 
if black oblivion seize upon my heart 
once to estrange my thought from Lelia love 

why nurse I be sure that Lelia hear from 
once a day at least by churm the lawyer 
who be his only friend 

what young master God bless my eye sight

I be sure my mistress will be glad to see you 
but what say you of master churm

and a secret friend to Sophos 

marry the devil he be trust he and hang he why he can speak a good word on he to my old master and he do so ruffle before my mistress with his barbarian eloquence and strut before she in a pair of polonian leg as if he be gentleman usher to the great Turk or the devil of Dowgate 
and if my mistress will be rule by he Sophos may go snick up but he have such a buttermilk face that she will never have he 

can falsehood lurk in those entice look 
and deep dissemblance lie where truth appear 

injurious villain to betray his friend 

sir do you know the gentleman 

faith not well 

why sir he look like a red herring at a noble man table on easter day and he speak nothing but almond butter and sugar Candie 

that be excellent 

this world the chaos of confusion 
no world at all but mass of open wrong 
wherein a man as in a map man see 
the high road way from woe to misery 

content yourself and leave these passion 
now do I sound the depth of all their drift 
the devil devise and churm his knavery 
on who this heart have vow to be revenge 
I will scatter they the plot already in my head 
nurse hie thou home commend i to my sister 
bid she this night send for master churm 
to he she must recount she many grief 
exclaim against her father hard constraint 
and so cunning temporize with this cunning Catso 
that he may think she love he as her life 
bid she tell he that if by any mean 
he can convey she forth her father gate 
unto a secret friend of she 
the way to who lie by this forest side 
that none but he shall have she to his bride 
for her departure let her point the time 
tomorrow night when Vesper begin to shine 
here will I be when Lelia come this way 
accompany with her gentleman usher 
who amorous thought do dream on nought but love 
and if this bastinado hold 
I will make he leave his wench with Sophos for a pawn 
let i alone to use he in his kind 
this be the trap which for he I have lay 
thus craft by cunning once shall be betray 
and for the devil I will conjure he 
good nurse be go bid she not fail 
and for a token bear to her this ring 
which well she know for when I see she last 
it be her favour and she give it i 

and bear she this from i 
and with this ring bid she receive my heart 
my heart alas my heart I can give 
how shall I give her that which be her own 

an your heart be she her heart be you 
and so change be no robbery

Come Sophos cheer up yourself man

until tomorrow at the appoint time 
when we will expect the come of your love 
what man I will work it through the fire

a basefellow you may be ashamed to say so 
for he be a honest fellow and a goodfellow 
and he begin to carry the very badge of good fellowship upon his nose that I do not doubt but in time he will prove as good a copper companion as Robin Goodfellow himself 
I and he be a tall fellow and a man of his hand too 
for I will tell you what tie he tuth bullring and for a bagpudding a custard a cheesecake a hog cheek or a calf head turn any man in the town to he and if he do not prove himself as tall a man as he let blind Hugh bewitch he and turn his body into a barrel of strong ale and let his nose be the spigot his mouth the faucet and his tongue a plug for the bung hole 
and then there will be robin goodfellow as good a drunken rogue as life and Tom shoemaker and I hope you will not deny that he be a honest man for he be constable oath town 
and a number of other honest rascal which though they be grow bankrupt and live by the reversion of other man table 
yet thanks be to God they have a penny among at all time at their need

how love and fortune both with eager mood 
like greedy hound do hunt my tire heart 
rouse forth the thicket of my wont joy 
and Cupid wind his shrill note bugle horn 
for joy my silly heart so near be spend 
desire that eager cur pursue the chase 
and fortune ride amain unto the fall 
now sorrow sing and mourning bear a part 
play harsh descant on my yield heart 
nurse what news 

faith a whole sackful of news 
you love Sophos and Sophos love you 
and Peter Ploddall love you and you love not he 
and you love not master churme and he love you 
and so here be love and no love 
and I love and I love not 
and I can tell what 
but of all and of all master churme must be the man you must love 

nay first I will mount i on the wing wind 
and fly for succour to the far Ind 
must I love master churme 

faith you must and you must not 

as how I pray thou 

marry I have commendation to you 

from who 

from your brother Fortunatus 

my brother Fortunatus 

no from Sophos 

from my love 

no from neither 

from neither 

yes from both 

prithee leave thy foolery and let i know thy news 

your brother Fortunatus and your love tomorrow night will meet you by the forest side 
there to confer about I know not what 
but it be like that Sophos will make you of his privy council before you come again 

be Fortunatus then return from the war 

he be with Sophos every day 
but in any case you must not let your father know 
for he have swear he will not be descry 
until he have effect your desire 
for he swagger and swear out of all cry 
that he will venture all 
both fame and blood and limb and life 
but Lelia shall be Sophos wed wife 

Alas nurse my father jealous brain 
do scarce allow i once a month to go 
beyond the compass of his watchful eye 
nor once afford i any conference 
with any man except with mr Churms 
who crafty brain beguile my father so 
that he repose trust in none but he 
and though he seek for favour at my hand 
he take his mark amiss and shoot awry 
for I have rather see the devil himself 
then churms the lawyer 
therefore how I shall meet they by the forest side 
I can possible devise 

and master churm must be the man must work the mean 
you must this night send for he 
make he believe you love he mighty 
tell he you have a secret friend dwell far away beyond the forest 
to who if he can secret convey you from your father 
tell he you will love he better than ever God love he 
and when you come to the place appoint 
let they alone to discharge the knave of club 
and that you must not fail 
here receive this ring which Fortunatus send you for ●●oken 
that this be the plot that you must prosecute 
and this from Sophos as his true love pledge 

this ring my brother send I know right well 
but this my true love pledge I more esteem 
then all the golden mine the solid earth contain 
and see in happy time here come M churm enter Chur 
now love and fortune both conspire 
and sort their drift to compass my desire 
M churms you be well meet I be glad to see you 

and I as glad to see fair Lelia 
as ever Paris be to see his dear 
for who so many trojan blood be spill 
nor think I will do less than spend my dear blood 
to gain fair Lelia love although by loss of life 

faith mistress he speak like a gentleman 
let i persuade you 
be not hard heart 
Sophos why what be he 
if he have love you but half so well he will have come through stone wall but he will have come to you ere this 

I must confess I once love Sophos well 
but now I can love he who all the world know to be a dissembler 

ere I will wrong my love with one day absence 
I will pass the boil Hellespont 
as once Leander do for hero love 
or undertake a great task than that 
ere I will be disloyal to my love 
and if that Lelia give her free consent 
that both our love may sympathize in one 
my hand my heart my love my life and all 
shall ever tend on Lelia fair command 

mr Churms methinks it be strange you shall make such a motion 
say I shall yield and grant you love 
when most you do expect a sunshine day 
my father will will mar your hope for hay 
and when you think to reap the fruit of love 
his hard constraint will blast it in the bloom 
for he so dote on Peter ploddal pelf 
that none but he forsooth must be the man 
and I will rather match myself 
unto a groom of Pluto grisly den 
then unto such a silly golden ass 

brave resolve i'faith 

but to be short 
I have a secret friend that dwell from hence 
some two day journey that be the most 
and if you can as well I know you may convey i thither secret 
for company I desire no other than your own 
here take my hand 
that once perform my heart be next 

if on the adventure all the danger lay 
that Europe or the western world afford 
be it to combat Cerberus himself 
or scale the brazen wall of Pluto court 
whenas there be so fair a prize propose 
if I shrink back or leave it unperformed 
let the world canonize i for a coward 
appoint the time and leave the rest to i 

when night black mantle overspread the sky 
and day bright lamp be drench in the west 
tomorrow night I think the fit time 
that silent shade may give our safe convoy 
unto our wish hope unseen of live eye 

and at that time I will not fail 
in that or aught may make for our avail 

but what if Sophos shall meet you by the forest side 
and in counter you with his single rapier 

Sophos a hop of my thumb a wretch a wretch 
shall Sophos meet we there accompany with some champion 
with who it be any credit to encounter 
be he as stout as Hercules himself 
then will I buckle with they hand to hand 
and bandy blow as thick as hailstone fall 
and carry Lelia away in spite of all their force 
what love will make coward fight 
much more a man of my resolution 

and on your resolution I will depend 
until tomorrow at the appoint time when I look for you 
till when I will leave you and go make preparation for our journey 

farewell fair love until we meet again 
why so do I not tell you she will be glad to run away with i at length 
why this fall out even as a man will say thus I will have it 
but now I must go cast about for some money too 
let i see I have outlaw three or four of Gripe debtor 
and I have the bond in i own hand 
the sum that be due to he be some two or three hundred pound 
well I will to they if I can get but one half 
I will deliver they their bond and leave the other half to their own conscience and so I shall be sure to get money to bear charge 
when all fail well fare a good wit

and fair Proserpina the queen of hell 
by full consent of all the damn hag 
and all the fiend that keep the stygian plain 
have send i here from depth of under ground 
to summon thou to appear at Pluto court

and because I know money go low with Sophos 
I will pay you your fee he beat he take that and that and that

under the old ruin of booby barn 
who as she live at length she likewise die 
and for her good deed go unto the devil 
but hell not wont to harbour such a guest

unto grim Pluto and his lovely queen 
of her unruly misbehaviour

for she to wander till the day of doom 
on earth again to vex the mind of man 
and swear she be the fit fiend in hell

at length not find any one so fit 
to effect her devilish damn charge as I 
she come to i as to her only child 
and i her instrument on earth she make 
and by that mean I learn this devilish trade 

o monstrous villain

of the best man I raise a common fame 
and honest woman rob of their good name

but if in hell do any place remain 
of more esteem than be another room

I will tear he with my tooth 

master nay pray you do not run mad 
I will tell you good news 
my young master Fortunatus be come home and see where he come 

if thou have say Lelia it have be something 

thus Fortunatus greet his father 
and crave his blessing on his bend knee 

ay here be my son but Lelia she will not come 
good Fortunatus rise will thou shed tear 
and help thy father moan 
if so say I if not good son be go 

what move my father to these strange fit 

faith sir he be almost mad I think he can tell you 
and therefore I presume sir that my wit be something better than he at this time do you mark sir 
out of the profound circumambulation of my supernatural wit sir do you understand 
will tell you the whole superfluity of the matter sir 
your sister Lelia sir you know be a woman 
as another woman be sir 

well and what of that 

nay nothing sir but she fall in love with one Sophos a very proper wise young man sir 
now sir your father will not let she have he sir 
but will have marry she to one sir 
that will have feed she with nothing but barley bag pudding and fat bacon 
now sir to tell you the truth 
the fool you know have fortune to land 
but M Lelia mouth do not hang for that kind of diet 

and how then 

marry then there be a certain crake cog pettifogging buttermilk slave sir one churm sir that be the very quintessence of all the knave in the bunch and if the best man of all his kin have be but so good as a yeoman man son 
he shall have be a mark knave by letter patent 
and he sir come i sneak and cozen they both of their wench and be run away with she 
and sir belike he have cozen your father here of a great deal of his money too 

sir your father do trust he but too much 
but I always think he will prove a crafty knave 

my trust betray my joy exile 
grief kill his heart my hope beguile 

where golden gain do blear a father eye 
that precious pearl fetch from Parnassus mount 
be count refuse worse than Bullen brass 
both joy and hope hang of a silly twine 
that still be subject unto flit time 
that turn joy into grief and hope to sad despair 
and end his day in wretched worldly care 
be I the rich monarch under heaven 
and have one daughter thrice as fair 
as be the grecian Menelaus wife 
ere I will match she to a untaught swain 
though one who wealth exceed Croesus store 
herself shall choose and I applaud her choice 
of one more poor than ever Sophos be 
be his desert but equal unto he 
if I may speak without offence 
you be to blame to hinder Lelia choice 
as she in nature grace do excel 
so do Minerva grace he full as well 

now by cock and pie you never speak a true word in your life he be a very kind gentleman 
for last time he be at our house he give i three penny 

o noble speak God send Peg to prove as wise a woman as her mother and then we shall be sure to have wise child 
nay if he be so liberal old grandsire you shall give he the goodwill of your daughter 

she be not i I have no daughter now 
that I shall say I have thence come my grief 
my care of Lelia past a father love 
my love of Lelia make my loss the more 
my loss of Lelia drown my heart in woe 
my heart woe make this life a live death 
care love loss heartswoe live death 
join all in one to stop this vital breath 
curse be the time I gape for golden gain 
I curse the time I cross she in her choice 
her choice be virtuous but my will be base 
I seek to grace her from the indian mine 
but she seek honour from the starry mount 
what frantic fit possess my foolish brain 
what furious fancy fire so my heart 
to hate fair virtue and to scorn desert 

then father give desert his due 
let nature grace and fair virtue gift 
one sympathy and happy consort make 
betwixt Sophos and my sister Lelia love 
conjoin their hand who heart have long be one 
and so conclude a happy union 

now it be too late 
what fate decree can never be recall 
her luckless love be fall to churm his lot 
and he usurp fair Lelia nuptial bed 

that can be fear of pursuit must needs prolong his nuptial right 
but if you give your full consent 
that Sophos may enjoy his long wish love 
and have fair Lelia to his lovely bride 
I will follow churme whatever betide 
I will be as swift as be the light foot Roe 
and overtake he ere his journey end 
and bring fair Lelia back unto my friend 

ay here be my hand I do consent 
and think her happy in her happy choice 
yet half forejudge my hope will be deceive 
but Fortunatus I must needs commend 
thy constant mind thou bear unto thy friend 
the after age wonder at the same 
shall sait a deed deserve last fame 

then rest you here till I return again 
I will go to Sophos ere I go along 
and bring he here to keep you company 
perhaps he have some skill in hide art 
of planet course or secret magic spell 
to know where Lelia and that fox lie hide 
who craft so cunning convey she hence 

i here I will rest a hour or twain 
till Fortunatus do return again
