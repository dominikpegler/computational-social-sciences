I will madam 

I that be very well This Howdee do I mean with a cast gown to put in apparel and make my gentleman usher not only for the aptness of his name to go on my visit but for his proportionable talon of wit and manner 

if I can yet redeem he he be happy by your leave lady may my boldness prove pardonable 

sir the name of he you come from be warrant sufficient to make your welcome here all that be here be his 

be this she trow 

I understand you come from sir Philip luckless 

it be true I bring his name thus far to enter i to your presence but here I shake it off as I will do his remembrance but that I know he too well 

too well sir How mean you 

too well indeed lady but in the ill part I know he to be no equal match for you yet I hear you receive he as a suitor 

right sir and he only 

it be not go so far I hope 

beshrew i but it be and far too sir he have all woo and win i 

beshrew your fortune then and if my counsel 
the friendly counsel ever you hearken to 
stop not your venturous foot from one step further 
for now you be upon the brink of danger 
you fall into a sea of endless sorrow 

this be pretty 

look back into yourself read over your story 
find the content the quiet mind you live in 
the wealth the peace the pleasure you enjoy 
the free command of all you have beneath you 
and none to be command by above you 
now glance your eye on this side on the yoke 
you bring your neck to load down with care 
where you shall faint draw a tedious life 
and every step encounter with new strife 
then when you groan beneath your burdenous charge 
and weary chance to revert a look 
upon the price you give for this sad thraldom 
you will feel your heart stab through with many a woe 
of which one die not while a thousand grow 
all will be then too late now be the time 
now ring the warn bell unto your breast 
where if you can but entertain a thought 
that tell you how you be beset with danger 
you be secure exclude it you be lose 
to endless sorrow buy with dear cost 

pray sir deal free with i what respect 
move you to make this strong dissuasion 
be it your care of i or love of he 

a subtle question this woman be not brainless 
love of he lady if this can be love 
to seek to cross he in so great a hope 
as your enjoy be all the mean 
or possibility he have to live on 
if it be love to he to let you know 
how lewd and dissolute of life he be 
by which his fortune be sink he be grow 
the scorn of his acquaintance his friend trouble 
be the common borrower of the town 
a gallant light not a tobacco pipe 
but with his borrow letter she be not move 
and if you put he off a fortnight long 
he will be lay up for money he take up 
to buy his knighthood beside his deep engagement 
to goldsmith silkman tailor milliner 
sempster shoemaker spurrier vintner tapster 
all stir her not she stand as if prepare 
to hear as much of truth and bear with it 
man of all trade and occupation 
from his mercer downward to his waterman 
have venture the last sixpence on his credit 
and all but wait to pay themselves from you 
and I may well imagine how it will grieve 
a woman of your wealth to disburse all 
to save a knight out of his ward in the counter 
and lack with all his company at home 
while he frequent youthful society 
to make more charge for nursery abroad 
for I have hear he say you be old and that 
it be your wealth he marry and not you 
if this be love to he that I discover 
the mean to save you to be his undo 
let no man take a friend help in his woo 

and how this shall proceed from care of i 
fall not into my understanding sir 

consider lady 

sir I have consider 
before and in your speech and since and can 
by all that can be say remove a thought 
I love he not for word nor will I use 
word against you it be poor expression 
of love to boast it it be enough I know it 
boaster of love how can we lover call 
when most of such love one not more than all 

sure I be much mistake in this woman 

nor will I have you to expect a rail 
to say you base wrong the gentleman 
a way so common common woman use it 
but this sir I will say I be too blame 
if I shall think your love to he be less 
than the great care of i you seem to urge 
as you pretend it be 

she will discover i 

you be his kinsman near and repute 
by his own mouth his best of choose friend 
my self a utter stranger one from who 
you never have or can expect least good 
and why you shall for a respect so contrary 
call my poor wit in question to believe you 
be most unconscionable 

methinks I stand 
like a false witness against another life 
ready to take his punishment 

nor will I fond think you mean to seek 
cross his match to make it for yourself 
both for my know unworthiness and your 
deprave he being no possible way 
to make i think the better of your worth 

can this be she how strange be I take 

but I forgive and charitable think 
all this bring no ill purpose pretty pageantry 
which may hereafter among our marriage mirth 
fill up a scene for now I will take no notice 
Indeed I will not you may if you please 
and tell your cousin how heinous I take it 

if thou have mercy love keep it from my heart 
wil it please you hear i 

sir I have enough 
and crave but leave to speak this little to you 
which shall by heaven be uncontrolled as fate 
if I shall find he bad I will blame my fortune 
never repent or thank you for your counsel 
if I shall find he good and all this false 
which you so violent have urge against he 
I will love he never the more nor you the worse 
for I be not so poor nor weak spirit 
that shall all friend to who my faith be bind 
say on their knowledge that all this be true 
and that one hour protraction of our marriage 
shall make it appear that I will give allowance 
to all their bugbear reason to defer 
that hour the unite of our hand because 
our heart be link by the divine law 

what have I do the curse of overween brain 
shame and disgrace be guerdon of my pain 
o I shall fall beneath the scorn of fool 
a punishment as just as great for such 
that do in thing concern they not too much 

what ail the gentleman 

o what a settle rock of constancy 
she plant her affection not to move 
though all the breath of slanderous reproach 
drive tempestuous cloud and storm of horror 
shall beat at once against it 

sir how do you 

madam 

not you sir 

I will I have not see at least not hear she 
in all so contrary to all opinion 

you be not well sir 

they say she be old unhandsome and uncivil 
forward and full of womanish distemper 
she be none of these but opposite in all 

sir 

my witty purpose be to save my friend 
from such a hazard and to loathe she so 
that I may make her loathsome to his fancy 
but I myself be fall into that hazard 
to wrong my friend to burn in lawless love 
which o that prayer or penance may remove 

you be not go sir 

I beg your pardon dare not look upon you 

go in a dream well I perceive this juggle 
this strain be only to explore the strength 
of my affection to my luckless knight 
for which if both their cunning I not fit 
let i be call the barren wife of wit 

the strangeness of this gentleman action will not out of my mind yet sir Philip can not but have a hand in it do he repent his bargain already and desire to be quit with loss of his earnest it be but his faith and troth 

sister where be you my governor and I be come to wait upon you in sir Philip luckless coach it wait at door for you and what to do think you 

I can not tell perhaps to invite i forth into the air of hyacinth or marrowbone or else

right Shee do but hold off till then and that wilful because she fear it be for constances love only that her husband desire the divorce 

and you be sure that Constance be safe from her discovery 

I upon the hazard of my discretion 

to any then that know she not very well if I appear not the same constancy you have give i her character right

Indeed sir it be my lady plot but you must take no notice of it 

I will thank she with all my heart and she shall never know on it 

but if sir Paul my now master shall discover my deceit how shall I escape his vengeance
