The Entrance to the Temple in the Palace.
Pymero, Chrystopheso, Pedro.







Not so early, Sir,
But I've already seen our watch re∣liev'd,
And bid our Guards be careful of their Charge,
The Fort being all our Strength.




Requires strict Eyes upon these Islanders:
Believe me, Sirs, they're false and desperate People,
And cruel as they're crafty, when they find
The least advantage of Surprize.






Their late attempt is yet too fresh amongst us,
In which against all Arms and Honesty
The Governour of Ternata seiz'd by stealth
This Islands Monarch, our confederate King,
While for diversion coasting in his Barge.



His royal Sister, the fair Quisara,

Has shew'd a noble Mind, and tendrest Love
To her afflicted Brother, and the Nobler,
Because his Ruin Stiles her Absolute,
The Heiress and Possessour of his Throne.



Such Charms and Vertue with just Admiration
Have robb'd the neighbouring Courts, and fill'd her Palace
With royal Suiters.




















If Fame has left her old trick of Lying,
Our Countryman and General, brave Riudias

Is in amongst 'em too, and has the start
Or my she-Oracle deceives me.



I have observ'd him oft, how privately
He has stoln from us, and how readily
Feigned business too, yea bid the Fort farewel:
Sure there is something in't.



Yet this grave Uncle
Has read me Lectures.



Yet you car'd not for't.



I' Faith not much, I ventur'd on still easily,
And took my chance, Danger's a Souldiers honour.



Might he succeed  



Fear not, our Family ne'er fail'd.



But have you, Pedro, seen the young Armusia?

The handsome Portuguese arrived here lately?
'Tis odds, Pymero, but he marrs your Game.



A Youth of noble promise, goodly, courteous,
Without Reservedness, grave, and doubtless Valiant;
For he that dares come hither, dares Fight any where.



Remember w'are i'th' Palace of the Island,


Not our own Fort: d'ye mark those Preparations?
Those Doors give entrance to the Princess Shrine,
The Seat of her Devotion, where this Morning
She Summons all her Suiters to assemble;
But for what purpose in such solemn State,
And that most awful Place, we are yet to learn.



Work for her Myrmedons.




But who are Chief?



There's first your King of Bakam, that speaks louder
In his own Commendations than a Cannon;
Yet He's struck Dumb with her.





A sprightly Lover, wise, and temperate:
The chief Sport, or rather Wonder, is;
The haughty Governour, her mortal Enemy,
He that surpriz'd her Brother, is struck too;
And under formal Hostages arriv'd.
But see the noble Stranger we describ'd.





Know there is nothing in our Power to serve you,
But you may freely challenge.



Sir, we thank you,
And rest your Servants.





You never saw this Court before.




And therefore least in Wonder and Delight
Such Government  



You shall see more anon,
That which will make you start; but hark,
The Signal's giv'n, and see the Pageants Enter.



Enter Bakam, Syana, and Governour with their Re∣spective Attendants.


THese sure are Islanders.







They are goodly Persons: What might hebe, Seignior,
That bears so proud a Port?



The King of Bakam,

A Fellow that looks so highly,
As if he had been begot on the Top of a Steeple.





A braver temper'd Fellow, and more valiant.



What rugged Face is that?




He that surpriz'd the King, and keeps him Captive.



See, their Eyes Lighten; Ware Thunder, Gentlemen.




Am I in competition with such Toys?



You speak loud, Sir.



Young Man, I will speak louder;
Can any Man but I deserve her Favour?
Ye petty Princes!



He'll put 'em all in's Pocket.



Thou proud vain Thing, whom Nature  




And that Fort-keeping Fellow.



How the Dog looks!
The Bandog Governour,







Keep thy Rank, Thing, with thy own petty Peers:
Call out the Princess.



Dost thou know me, Bladder?

Art thou acquainted with my Nature?
What canst thou merit?



Merit! I'm above it.
Honour's my Servant, Fortune is my slave;
I slight ye Insects: had not the vain people


Bestow'd some Titles on ye,
I should forget your Names.




What a blown Fool has self-affection made!



His Mother long'd for Bellows sure and Bag-pipes.



Swallow'd a Drum, and was deliver'd of an Alarm.



Sir, talk a little handfomer; talk softlier,
That we may be able tohold pace with you; We are Princes,
But those are petty things with you: talk wiser,
As 'twill become your Mightiness: talk less,
That Men may think you can do more.




That Men may think y'are honest, and believe you.



Why, I can talk and do.
I'll tell you, only I deserve the Princess,
And make good only I; if you dare, you,
Or you, Syana's Prince.



Here lies my proof.



I'll be short with you,
For those long Arguments I was never good at.



How white the Boaster looks.





FOR shame forbearye Princes, rule your Angers;
You violate the Freedom of this Place,
The State and Royalty  



He's well content I see, so I have done.



Is this she Seignior?



This is the Princess, Sir.



An admirable Form: They had cause to justle.



You wrong me and my Court, contentious Princes:
Comes your Love drest in Violence to seek us?
Is't fit our Palace; this most sacred Shrine
Should be polluted with your bloody Rage?


My very Altar's frighted with your Swords.
He that loves me, loves my Commands; be temperate,
Or be no more what you profess, my Servants.



We are calm as Peace.



Heav'n! What command she carries,
And what a sparkling Majesty flies from her.



Since you're for Action, I shall find you Danger;
But not this way: 'tis not this mean Contention
Amongst your selves, nor Courtship to my Face:
Who best can love, or who can flatter most,
Shall guide my Choice; he that will hope my favour
Must winn me with his Worth.







I shall, and then shew you
A will to tread that way, I'll say you're worthy.



What Task now will she turn them to? These hot Youths I fear
Will find a cooling Card.



First I shall call our Country Gods to witness
With highest Adorations, what I promise.

Now give me hearing: 'tis well known to you
I had a Royal Brother, now most Wretched,
And Prisoner to this Man: were I Ambitious,
Or coveted these Glories not Born mine,
His Miseries should bear a lasting Date;
Or were I Covetous; had my Heart set
On Riches, or on pleasures Uncontroul'd,
There he should Die; his Death would give me These,
For then stood I up absolute.
Yet all theseflattering shews of Dignity,
These golden Dreams of Greatness cannot force me
To forget Nature and a King's Distress.



Now Uncle play the Marks-man.
Quick, watch her Word, and shoot on the Wing.



Thereforethe Man that would be known my Lover,
Must first be known my Brothers faim'd Redeemer:
Bring him alive or dead to my Embraces,
(For even his Bones must scorn such Slavery)
Or seek another Mistress.







How they stand gaping all!



I grant ye Princes 'twill be hard
To do this, wondrous hard, a great Adventure:
But finish't, the Reward is worthy of it.
You hear your Task.



Tell her 'tis done, Sir;
You'll ride upon a Whirlwind,
And bring him home on Lightning.




Ruidias, cold? not fly like Fire into't.
Perhaps you doubt me, Princes,
He that shall do this is my Husband;
By that most bright and sacred Shrine I Swear,
Before these holy Men I here proclaim it.
No stirring yet.





If, Madam, to attempt
This royal Rescue, through all forms of Danger,
Might Crown our Hope, I had not lost this Minute;
But here, where Conduct must keep pace with Courage,
The starting fiery Will is rein'd with Torment
To Judgment's flower March.



Take your own Method.



Madam, believe him here: I'll raise an Army,
Shall bring him to your Island, Fort and all,
And fix it here.



How long will this be doing?
You should have begun this in your Grandsire's Days.



What may be, Madam,
And what my power can promise, I engage:
My Will I'm fure stands fair.




Madam, their Power and Arts are all too weak,
'Tis only in my Will to give your wishes.
The King your Brother is my Prisoner;
Then thus the Bargains finish'd, take your Prisoner,
And make me yours, close Prisonerto these Arms:
Say but the word, your Brother shall be Rendred.
Quick as your Wish.




I hate both you, your Country, and your Love:
Heav'n knows how dear I prize his Liberty,
But 'ere I would so basely buy his Freedom,
I'd study to forget he was my Brother.
By force you took him; he that would possess me,
Must fetch him back by force, or ne'er succeed.







Now could I love her, though she's Vertuous.



By force, and make you glad to let him go.



You may look nobler on me.



I say by force, and suddenly;
He lies there till he Rots else: so return, Sir,
And glad we have kept Faith for your safe passage,
Rather than take him as thy Courtesy;
Though no Condition were propos'd, I'd see him
Far sunk in Earth, and there forget him.







Your Hopes are great, good Governour.



Am I then made a Property?
I'll check this Pride, I'll quench this Bravery,
And turn your glorious Scorn to Tears and Howling;
I will, proud Princess: This Neglect of me
Shall make your Brother King most Miserable;
For as till now I've us'd him like a King,
And seen all Royal Offices perform'd,
He now shall lie a sad L•a••• Dungeon,
Loaden with Chains and Fetters, Cold and Hunger,
Darkness and lingring Death for his Companions:
And let me see who dares attempt his Rescue;
What desperate Fool look towards it: Farewel:
And when you find him thus lament your Scorn.
Nay, I shall make you kneel to take my Offer.
Once more farewell; and put your Trust in Puppits.




If none dare undertake't, I'll live a Mourner.
Now Ruidias.





Cousin we must resolve and speedily.
Walk with me, Gentlemen.




Now, Sir, you stand as you were Charm'd.




O Sforza and Emanuel!











I see your drift, and fear'd the consequence.
Consult your safety, Sir, we know your worth,
And must not see you perish; you are my charge.




Would this be to put forward, Sirs? What Glory?



And what an everlasting wealth to Crown it?



To step into't while they are thinking.




The Fort's impregnable without a Guard.



By Heav'n I'll rule in this.



If it must be!



Stay not for second Thoughts   O she's an Angel!
At least we can attempt, our very Fate
Will sometimes be the Theam of her Discourse,
And I would die Ten thousand thousand Deaths
To have her talk of me. Away.






Enter Keeper and two or three Moors.



I Have kept many Men, and many great,
But must confess I never saw till now
A Person of such sufferance; he lies now
Where I would not have laid my Enemies Dog,
Where neither Light nor Comfort can approach him,
Nor Air nor Earth that's wholesome.





Load him with Irons, oppress him with Contempts,
Such are our Governours Orders; give him nothing
To feed Life, or so small 'tis next to nothing,
It moves not him, he smiles upon his Miseries,
And bears 'em with such strength, as if his Nature
Had been Nurst-up, and Foster'd with Calamities.



He gives no ill words, curses not, repines not,
Blames nothing, hopes in nothing.




And in the midst of all these Frights, fears nothing.



He fears not, even when I my self shake for him,
As many times my pity will constrain me;
When other Souls that bear not half his Burden,
Shrink in their powers, and burst with their oppression,
Then will he Sing; wooe his Afflictions,
And Court them in sad Airs, as he wou'd wed'em.






What stubborn weight of Chains?




Yet he looks temperately.
No wildness, no distemper'd touch upon him;
How constantly he Smiles, and how undaunted.



Mark with what Majesty he heaves his Head up.
Hark now.









Do not disturb him  

Sir, your allowance from the Governour; wou'd 'twere more,
Or in my pow'r to make it handsomer.



Do not transgress thy Charge, I take his bounty;
Fate hurts not him that bears a mind contented,
And hangs not on vain hopes, that may corrupt him.








What, at your Banquet?
And in such State, and with such change of Service?



Nature's no Glutton, Sir; a little serves her.



This Diet's wholesom then.



I Beg no better.



Give him less next,
These full Meals will oppress his Health; his Grace
Is of a tender Constitution.



Mock on, it moves not me, Sir.
I cast your Mirth and Malice both behind me.



You carry't handsomly but tell me, Patience,

Do you not Curse the brave and Royal Lady,


Your gracious Sister? Do you not Dam her pity?
Dam twenty times a Day? Dam seriously?
Coud'st thou not wish her a Bastard, Whore, or that
Thou had'st no Sister?
Blaspheming Heav'n for making such a Mischief;
For giving Pow'r to Pride, and Will to Women?



No, Tyrant, no, I love and Bless her for't;
And though her Scorn of Thee should heap upon me
As many Plagues as Air corrupted breeds;
As many Mischiefs, as the Hours have Minutes;
As many forms of Death, as doubt can Frame,
I still should Love her more; more Honour her.
All thou can'st lay upon me, cannot bend me,
Not even the stroak of Death, that I despise too.
So let Quisara always scorn thy Love;
As I for ever shall despise thy Cruelty.
Cou'd fear possess me thou shouldest ever Win her:
And that she is not Mistress of this Temper,
She is no Kin to me, and I contemn her.



You are Valiant, Sir.



Yes Sir, and Fortunate;
For he that holds my Constancy, still Conquers.



You will relent for all this Talk, I fear not.




Or if I were so weak, to be wrought to it,
I still should Curse her Heart, if she consented.



You shall write, and entreat, or  




I'th' mid'st of all thy Tortures, I'll Laugh at thee;
And think thee not more Valiant, but more Villain:
Nothing thou hast done brave, but like a Thief
Atchiev'd by Craft, and kept by Cruelty.



Down with him lower yet, there let him Murmur,
And see his Diet be so spare, and little,
He grow not thus High-hearted on't   I'll cool ye.
Give him no Liberty, let his Bands be doubled;
Let him not Sleep, nothing that's dear to Nature
Let him enjoy   yet take heed he Dies not;
Keep him as near Death, as wishing for't,


As possible: But let him not arrive to't.
I'll humble him,

And her proud Heart, that stands on such defiance;
And let me see her Champions, that dare venture;
Her high and blustering Suiters   keep close Guard,
And as you prize your Lives, be diligent,
And what I charge, observe.



We shall be Dutiful.







A Vault under the Castle.

Armusia, Sforza, Ema∣nuel, with powder Barrels, and light Matches.


OUR prosperous Voyage, was a lucky Omen;
A lucky, and fair Omen.



May it prove so.



The Sea and Wind strove which shou'd most be∣friend us.
Where lies our Boat?



Safe lodg'd within the Reeds behind the Castle;
Where no Eye can perceive, or thought suspect.



These Merchants Habits too have done us Service;
Unquestion'd thus I've Travell'd through the Town;
View'd all the Tyrants Magazines; got knowledge
Ev'n of the Prison, and the Pow'r that Guards it
Where the King's Dungeon'd.



You attempt strong work.



Courage is strong, beside a Monarchs Fate's in't;
Yet loose or win, there's no retiring now.



I see't; your Valiour, Sir, has seal'd your Fate;
Yet must confess your Ruin will be Glorious.



Thus far our Game holds fair, as Merchants we
Have hired this Vault, and stow'd those mettled Wares
That soon will vent themselves without a Chap-man.



The Trains are all laid, Sir.




That no false Ear may reach us, o'er this Vault
The Castle stands, where this proud Governour
Has stor'd his Arms and Treasure, next to that
The Prison where the injur'd King is kept.



What of all this?



You're dull, if ye perceive not:
These Friends which we have here bestowed, will soon
Speak out for us.







The Fire I here brought with me
Shall break into material Flames, and bright ones;
That all the Island shall stand wondering at
An hour hence; noble Friends, look for the Fury,
The Fire to light us to our Honour'd purpose.








Sforza, I have seen thee braver.



Hell catch my Soul, if for my self I fear;
But with what Eyes, can I behold your Fate,
Your Sinews stretch'd on the revenging Rack.
(Less cannot be expected) that dear Breast,
Torn piece-meal, and that noble Heart lie panting.
The Castle's Ribbed with Rock, the Prison warded.



I say we have a chance for't,
When the Towns full of fright, the Governour
Out of his Wits, to see th'imperious Flames:
The people there imploy'd to stop the Ruins,
And few regarding any private Office:
Then fly we to the Prison instantly,
And push for the King's Rescue.







Let us be worthy of it by our Courage,
And so take leave, but keep still within sight,
Till the Flames Rise, then meet to do or die:
Fail not dear Fire, and Powder,
Hold thy Nature




My Heart bodes with thy Fate brave Youth;
But we will sell thee dearly.






No, Captain, for those Troops, we need them not,
The Town is strong enough to stand their furies;
I wou'd see 'em come and offer to do something,
They are high in words.



'Tis safer, Sir, than doing.



Do'st thou think they dare attempt.



May be, by treaty,
But sure, by force, they will not prove so forward.



No faith, I warrant thee, they know me well enough,
And know they have no Child in hand to play with:
They know my naturetoo I have bit some of them,
And to the Bones; they havereason to remember me.
It makes me laugh to think how glorious
The Fools are in their promise, and how pregnant
Their wits and power are to bring things to pass;
Am not I grown lean with loss of sleep, and care
To prevent these threatnings, Captain?



You look well, Sir:
Upon my Conscience, you are not like to sicken
Upon any such conceit.



I hope I shall not:
Well, wou'd I had this wench, for I must have her,
She must be mine; and there's another charge, Captain;
What betwixt love and brawling, I got nothing:
All goes in maintenance  
Heark, what's that,

That noise there, it went with a violence.



Some old wall, belike, Sir,
That hath no neighbour-help to hold it up,
Is fallen suddenly.



I must discard these Rascals,
That are not able to maintain their buildings,
They blur the beauty of the Town.





I hear another Tune, good Captain;
It comes on fresher still, 'tis loud and fearful:


Look up into the Town, how bright the Air shews;
Upon my life some sudden Fire.



I hear the noise more clear.













Suddenly taken in a Merchants Vault, Sir,
Fearful and high it blazes; help, good people.



Pox o'their paper houses, how they smother;
They light, like Candles; how the Roar still rises?





Your Magazin's a fire, Sir, help, help suddenly,
All will be lost, get the people presently;
And all that are your Guard, and all help, all hands, Sir,
Your wealth, your stength is burnt else, the Town perish'd,
The Castle now begins to flame.







A Merchant's house next joyning? Shame light on him,
That ever such a Neighbour, such a Villain  



Go raise all the Garrison, and bring them up.
Enter other Citizens.

And beat the people forward   Oh I have lost all
In one House, all my hopes, good worthy Citizens,
Follow me all, and all your powers give to me;
I will reward you all. Oh cursed fortune  
The flames more, arise still, help, help, Citizens,
Freedom and wealth to him that helps; follow, oh follow,
Fling Wine, or any thing, I'll see it recompenc'd.
Buckets, more buckets, fire, fire, fire.




Then Enter Armusia and his Company breaking open a Door.


So, thou art open, keep the way clear
Behind still, now for the place.







Sure, this is it,
Force open the door   A miserable Creature,
Yet, by his manly face  




Why stare ye on me?
You cannot put on Faces to fright me:
In Death, I am a King still, and contemn ye:
Where is that Governour? Methinks his manhood
Should be well pleas'd to see my Tragedy,
And come to Bath his stern eyes in my sorrows;
I dare him to the sight, bring his scorn with him,
And all his rugged threats, here's a throat, Souldiers,
Come see who can strike deepest.



Break the Chain there.



What does this mean?



Come, talk of no more Governours,
He has other business; Sir, put your Legs forward,
And gather up your courage, like a man,
We are Friends,
And come to give your Sorrows ease.




Delays may lose all agen.












Make speedy and sure work.







Up with them, & to the Boat stand, fast, now be speedy,
When this heat's past, we'll sing our History
Away like Thought.



Now sacred Chance be ours.



Pray when we have done, Sir.





What, is the Fire out? or past the worst yet?



'Tis out Neighbour, I can tell you, but whether past the worst, or no, I know not. I never wrought so stout∣ly since I was a Man; I have been burnt at both ends like a Squib,   I liv'd two long Hours in the Fire: The Flame at last got down my Throat, and broke out again at my North-Door. If they had not clap'd in a Dozen Buckets upon me as they did, I had flam'd up, and been one of the Seven Stars by this time.



He wou'd have made a rare Flambeau.



Well said Wax-Chandler; thou art in thy Element.



Now you talk of Elements, 'pray' Neighbours how many Elements are there?



Why, there's but one, Fool, where the Sun and Moon dwell, and all their little Prentices.



Well said Shopkeeper: Thou art in thy Element too. Dost call 'em Prentices, I have known 'em These Three∣score Years, and sure they are out of their time by this, or they do not serve by our Charter. I tell ye there are four Elements; Water and Malt, are two of 'em; and Fire and Brimstone t'other. They have past through me a lit∣tle too late, I thank 'em.



My Wife took leave of me a hundred times after I was burnt to a Cinder, yet I bore up still, and tost the Buc∣kets, Boys.



I'th' latter end o'th' hurry, me thought I heard a Voice cry, Treason.



Murder you might, by Timbers falling, but for my part as a House fell, I still stept into th' Chimney.



Ay, Neighbour, if ev'ry Man had wrought as you did.



Why? I stole nothing Neighbour.



How many Rogues were there pretending to help remove Goods, and ran away with them?



And your damn'd, Suburb Cart-rogues: an I were Governour, I would not leave a Carter unhang'd for twen∣ty Miles round. This honesty is my ruin, Neighbours; I could have born my Poverty, had Fortune not made me honest; or Honesty, if she had not made me poor, but both together   the Devil himself were not able to live on't.



Right Neighbour, my Conscience whisper'd me to Steal in the Fire, but my honesty would not suffer it. O for some Drink; get me a whole Tun of Drink, whole Ci∣sterns, for I have Four Dozen of Fire-brands in my Belly, and Smoak enough in my Throat, to bloat a Shoal of Her∣rings.



We'll lay you under the Tap, and let the Tub run through you.



And, Neighbour, you shall lie at my Bung again, to take't at second-hand.



Well, since we have no plunder our selves, let's set our selves to Drink, and rail at them that have.



Look, yonder comes our Governour, a worse Plague than the Fire; he has Beams enough yet standing to hang all for helping him. Away.










MAKE ready all, we'll Sail with the next Flood.
'Tis fit I should be foremost in the Attempt,
As in her favour, I stand first   Let's see.

My self, my Cousin, and my Garrison;
With our Confederate Neighbours o'th' out-Isles.
I trust we cannot fail.   What means that shout?





Where are you, Sir?



Not yet aboard, Pymero?




Alas we are topt, Sir:
Turn'd all to shotten Herrings, the King, Sir:
The King's come home agen.



The Devil  



Nay, sure he came o'Gods Name.



Who shou'd attempt him:
The Princes are all here.



'Tis done, Sir, and most bravely.



It cannot be! done! Who dares do it?



An honest Fellow, who it seems has ended
His Market, 'ere you were up.




Can it be possible,
A stranger, that I have not known nor seen;
A man I never grac'd: O Captain, Captain!

What shall we do? I am betray'd by Fortune:
It cannot, shall not be.



'Twas Witch-craft did it:
No mortal means cou'd take effect so soon.



Must I then be given
To a Man I never saw, nor spoke withal,
And know not of what Nation?   O Ruidias,

This might have your Lot  

The general Joy comes on, and I must meet it:
But with what Comfort  





I am not welcome yet, till you embrace me.



My Dear, and Royal Brother! Joy o'er pow'rs me,
To see you safe again, your Self and Mighty.



A general gladness, Sir, spreads through the City,


And Mirth possesses all for your Redemption,
'Twas a brave Venture, whosoever put for it;
A high and noble One, worthy much honour;
Yet had it mist, my Project had not fail'd,
Andin short time  



I thank you noble, Sir;
I know you love me.



I have an Army, Sir,
That wou'd have scowr'd your Tyrant, and his Confines,
And rung him such a Peal.




To make a Dog howl.



I have done nothing, Sir, and therefore think't
Convenient to say little what I purpos'd,
And what my Love design'd.



I like your Modesty. My royal Friends,
I thank ye all: I know it griev'd ye
To hear my Misery   but this Man, Princes,
I must thank heartily indeed;
For this Man saw me in it, and redeem'd me;
He look't upon me sinking, and plundg'd for me:
This wondrous Man, even from the Grave of Sorrow,
Has new begot my Name, and once more made me:
O Sister, if there may be thanks for this,
Or any thing near Recompence, invent it.



You are too noble, Sir; there is reward,
Reward above my Action too, by Millions;
A Recompence so rich and glorious,
I durst not dream it mine   but that it was promis'd,
But that it was Propounded, Sworn and Seal'd
Before the Face of Heav'n.
For nothing in the life of Man or Merit,
(It is so truly great) cou'd else embrace it.



O speak it, speak it, bless my Ear to hear it;
Make me a happy Man to know 'tmay be;
For still methinks I am a Prisoner,
And feel no Liberty, till I find that.



It is   but first to Heav'n, and you I bend,
If either can forgive the high Demand;


It is your Sister, royal Sir; she's mine:
I claim her, by her own word, and her honour:
It was her open promise to the Man,
That durst redeem you   Beauty set me on,
And Fortune Crowns me fair, if she receive me.



Receive you, Sir,   why Sister   ha   turn from him?
Stand as you knew not me, nor what he has ventur'd,
My dearest Sister?



Good, Sir, your pardon:
There is a blushing Modesty about her
That holds her back; Virgins are nice to Love;
I wou'd not have her forc'd; give her fair liberty:
Creatures of such soft Nature, if compell'd,
Turn into fears, and fly from their own Wishes.



Look on him Princess, is there such another?
Oh! all ye Pow'rs so excellent in Nature;
In Honour, so abundant!




My word is pass'd, and he by that has purchas'd;
But, good Sir, give me leave to think some time
To be acquainted with his worth   We are Strangers.
For Love like Power, must pass through Ceremonies,
'Ere he can fix in Virgin Hearts.




You will respect your Word, I know you will;
I'll be your pledge, my Hero, come my Sister,
Let's see what welcome you can give a Prisoner,
And what fair looks, a Friend  
Thus in my Arms, once more.



You make me blush, Sir.



Lead on, This Day shall see
Our whole Court Crown'd with Pleasure.










ACT III. SCENE I.
The Palace.
Armusia, Sforza, Emanuel.


WHY are you sad, Sir? what can grieve or vex you?
That have the pleasures ofthe World, the profits,
The Honours, and the Loves at your dispose?



I want what Beggars are allow'd I mean content.
I want the Grace I have merited, the favour,
The due respect.



Does not the King allow it?



Yes, and all Honours else that I can ask,
Or he has power to give: but Oh! his Sister,
That scornsul Cruelty; forgive me, Beauty,
That I Transgress from her, that shou'd look on me;
That shou'd a little Smile upon my Service,
And fosten my Deserts, for her own Faith's sake:
That shou'd at least acknowledge me, speak to me.



And you go Sighing up and down for this;
Lamenting and disputing of your Grievances?



What wou'd you have me do?
Do what a Man wou'd in this Case, a wise man,
An understanding Man, that knows the Sex.
Go to her.







And talk as you fought for her boldly;
Both what you are, and what you have deserv'd.



It makes me smile.



Now you look handsomely;
Had I so fair a Prize to win,
I wou'd so flatter.



Pray take our Counsel.



I shall do something,
But not your way, it seems too Boisterous,


For my Affections are as fair, and gentle,
As her I serve. Friends leave me to my thoughts
An Hour or two, anon you shall command me.



I hate this thinking, it marrs all business.



We shall look for you, Sir.




What shall I do to make her know my Misery,
To make her sensible   This is her Woman.


I have a Toy come to me suddenly,
That may work for the best, she can but scorn me,
Lower I cannot fall   I try my Fate:
May I presume, fair One  



'Tis the brave Stranger.
Now by my Ladies Hand, a handsome Gentleman.
How happy shall she be in such a Husband:
Wou'd I were so provided.



Can you have so much Charity for a Stranger;
To let him pass this Evening in your Company,
And what must be a Charity indeed
(In one whose Youth and Beauty dart such Charms)
To think my meaning fair.



I dare believe you;
Or if it were not, that's no great matter,
What have we Vertue for, but to be exercis'd;
Besides we take mens promises   Wou'd you speak
With me, Sir?



That you wou'd favour me with your acquaintance;
I wou'd say Friendship, for my Grief requires it.
You are the Princess confident,
And wait upon her near?







With one kind office, you may bind a Gentleman
Hereafter to be yours.
Such beauteous Faces shou'd have courteous Minds,
And ready Faculties.



Tell me your business;
Yet if it be to her, I think your self, Sir,
Wou'd do much better:


The Princess must be pleased with your Addresses;
I'm sure I shou'd.




And yet am but a Stranger, wou'd fain speak with her



'Tis growing late, and on her Hour of Sleep.



Pray wear this, and believe my meaning Civil.
My business of that fair respect and carriage.



I must do't now, an'I were to be hang'd: nay, and I
Will do't; for another so good, and from a Gentleman
So handsom, I shou'd even venture upon high
Treasure.



I wou'd speak to her, and privately.



So you shall, Sir.
My Service were not else worth thanks: you must make hast, Sir.







And I must leave you in my Chamber, Sir:
Where you must lock your self, that none may see you:
'Tis next to hers   You cannot miss the Entrance,
When she comes down to Bed.



Once more I thank ye, Lady.



Thank me but thus.










So far and truly you have discovered to me
The former currents of my life and fortunes,
That I am bold to acknowledge you most holy,
And certainly to credit your predictions,
Of what are yet to come.



I am no lyer,
'Tis strange I should, and live so near a Neighbour;
But these are not my ends.



I pray you sit, good Father,
Certain a reverend Man, and most Religious.



I; that belief's well now, and let me work then,
I'll make ye curse Religion before I leave ye;
I have liv'da long time, Son, a mew'd up Man,
Seauestred by the special hand of Heaven,


From the World's vanity, all to find out knowledge,
Which I have now attained to, thanks to Heaven,
All for my Countries good too, and many a Vision,
Many a Mystick Vision, have I seen Son.
And many a sight from Heaven, which has been terrible,
Wherein the goods and evils of these Islands,
Were lively shadowed; many a charge have I had too.
Still as the time grew ripe, to reveal these,
To travel and discover, now I am come, Son,
The hour is now appointed,
And now I speak.



Do holy man, I'll hear ye.



Beware these Portugals, I say, beware'em,
These smooth-fac'd strangers, have an Eye on 'em,
The cause is now the Gods; hear and believe, King.




  I do hear, but before I give rash credit,
Or hang too-light on belief, which is a Sin, Father;
Know I have found 'em gentle, faithful, valiant,
And am in my particular bound to 'em,
I mean to some for my most strange deliverance.



O Son, the future aims of men! observe me,
Above their present actions, and their glory,
Are to be looked at, the Stars show many turnings
If you could see, mark but with my eye, Pupil;
These men came hither, as my Vision tells me,
Poor, weather-beaten, almost starved, feebled,
Their Vessels like themselves, most miserable,
Made a long sute for Trafique, and for comfort,
To vend their Childrens toys, cure their diseases:
They had their sute, they landed and to the rate,
Grew rich and powerful, suck'd the Fat and Freedom
Of thy most noble Isle, taught her to tremble,
Witness the Castle here, the Citadel,
They have clapt up the neek of your Tidore,

This happy Town, till that she knew these strangers;
To check her, when she is Jolly.



They have so, indeed Father.



Take heed, take heed, I find your fair delivery,
Though you be pleased to glorifie that Fortune,


And think these strangers Goods, take heed, I say,
I find it but a handsome preparation,
A fair fac'd Prologue to future mischief:
Mark but the end, good King, the pin he shoots at,
That was the Man delivered ye; the Mirrour.
Your Sister is his due, what's she, your heir, Sir?
And what's he a kin then to the Kingdom?
But heirs are not Ambitious, who then suffers?
What Reverence shall the Gods have? and what Justice?
The miserable People, what shall they do?



He points at Truth directly.



Think of these, Son:
The Person, nor the manner I dislike not
Of your Preserver, nor the whole Man together,
Were he but season'd in the Faith we are,
Or our Devotions learned.



You say right, Father.



To change our worships now, and our Religion;
To be Traytor to our God.



You have well advis'd me,
And I will seriously consider, Father,
In the mean time you shall have your fair access
Unto my Sister, advise her to your purpose,
And let me still know how the Gods determine.



I will, but my main end is to advise
The Destruction of you all, a general Ruine,
And when I am reveng'd, let the Gods whistle.






Quisara laid Melancholy. Panura waiting. Soft Musick and Song.



I slept but ill last Night.



You'll sleep the better to Night I hope, Madam.



A little Rest contents me   fetch my Book.



I'm glad of that.




I'll read awhile before I sleep.


And if Ruidias meet you, and be importunate,
He may come in.



I have better fare for you.
Aside.
Now least in sight play I.







Ye Gods how happy is that Shepherdess,
Who through Love is to the Plains confined,
And ne're aspires above the Shepherds Tribe;
Yet still she's free to take the Swain she Loves,
While Royal Virgins Hearts are publick Pawns
To serve the needs of State; barter'd and sold:
Nor can I only blame my Birth or Fortune;
Virtue and Honour have alike betrayed me.
The Kings restor'd, but I a Prisoner made.
By promise his Restorer's Sacrifice.
Oh Fortune! Fatal Virtue! Oh Ruidas!


Shield me ye Powers! What's here?
Sure 'tis the Phantasm of the Man I dread;
Form'd by my Fears: Who are you; and whence come you?



You sure may know me:
I bring no such Amazement.



Who waits there? rude Intruder speak?
What means this Treachery? Who let you in?



My restless Love that serves you.



This is an Impudence unparallell'd,
A rudeness that becomesa Thief or Ruffian.
Nor shall my Brother's Love protect this boldness;
My Rooms are Sanctuaries, and shall be approach'd
With Reverence equal to the Temples of
Our Gods.



Mine are not less.



I am Mistress of my self, and will not be
Thus Visited, spight of boasted Service.



Most Royal.  




Stand off, I see dishonour in your Eyes.





By all that Beauty they are innocent;
'Pray' tremble not, you have no Cause.



So base a Violation of my Privacy?



If there be in you any Female pity,
And that your fears have not proclaimed me Monstrous,
Look on me and believe me; is this Violence?
The Griefs and Sorrows that grow here, Impudence?
Is it to fall thus prostrate to your Beauty,
A Ruffian's boldness? is Humility Rudeness?
Far be it from my Heart to fright your Quiet,
And heaviest Curse fall on me, when I intend it.







Had I been mischievous,
As then I must be Mad, or were a Monster,
If any such base Thoughts had harbour'd here,
Or Violence becoming not a Man,
You have a thousand Bulwarks to assure you,
The Holy Powers bear shields for Chastity.
If you misdoubt me still,
Or yet retain a fear I am not honest,
Or come with impure Thoughts to these blest Mansions,
Take this and sheath it here; be your own safety:
Make hast to rid fears, and let me perish.
How willing shall I sleep to satisfie you!



What came you then for?



To complain, my Angel,
But Modestly.








For though I die I will not blame the Doer.
To instance what I have done to obtain you,
If any thing that Love Commands, may reach you,
To have remember'd you   but I'm unworthy,
And to that Misery falls all my Fortune,
That Oh I fear to claim what you have promised!
(So much more easy was the Task proposed,


Than to demand the Recompence) to have told you,
That as my Love is honest 'tis confirm'd.
Beyond the Power even of your dread Commands,
To change or make it less; beyond your Scorn:
For though despairing I have sworn to Marry
You or your Memory   'Pray' be not Angry.



Then you would have me pass a fair Opinion
Of this untimely Entrance; that it meant
No Violation to my Peace or Honour,
And but the rash Effects of Love's Excess?



No more by Heaven.



And that you are hereafter
Devoted to my Service.







I'll try then your Obedience.








Then from this hour expect no farther favour, nor once remember services you have done, nor dangers past, nor the rewards due to them.



Is this my Doom, and is there no Redress?




Which you must wholly to my Favour owe;
For I must blush to tell your Cure   I LOVE  
My Heart was all dispos'd before you claim'd it;
Fancy had got the start of your Deserts,
Which yet I prize so high, that for your Ease,
I force my Modesty on this Confession,
To disengage your hopes: nor let the Man,
That has so highly serv'd, depend
On Fruitless Air.



This is indeed Court Mercy,
To let the Suitor know his Doom betimes.
But, Madam, was.  



I've said and must enjoyn you,
To quit this Place immediately.





As he is going out he justles with Ruidias Entring.


Ha! Who is This?











Thou art no more I am sure.   Oh'tis Ruidias,

And I perceive her favour'd Lover.



Is there not Door enough,
You takesuch Elbow room?



What I take I'll carry.



Do's this become you Princess?



Jealousalas of Mee! How blind is Man.
Go, freely go, I give thee Leave.







The Place and you are privileged; therefore go.





What a pure Soul inhabits in this Youth?
Courage and Temper; such transcending Worth,
As cannot fail to make Impress of Love
In heart not pre-engaged: My choice is past!



Am I then made your Property? Are these, Madam,
The Banquets that you bid me to? the trust
I build my goodly hopes on?




Your Love stands yet upon my Courtesie;
I never gave you Promise, bare Permission,
To tell your Love was all i've yet allow'd,
And if you do abuse your Privilege  




Armusia here, and in the dead of Night?
May I not, Madam, take the leave to ask,
How he came hither; pressing, or invited?



You are too bold.



What, At these private Hours?



You are to rash to tax me with an Error.
Know what I am, and my Prerogative,
I never taught you too dispose my Freedom.
How durst you touch my Honour, blot my meaning,
And name an Action and of mine, but Noble!
Are those the Gratitudes you bring, Ruidias,

The Thanks, the Services? How have I grac'd thee?
And dost thou in return upbraid my Vertue?



I was to blame.




Armusia wou'd not pass so rash a Censure,
And Justice tells me I should punish thee:
But 'twas a fault of Love   Yet learn henceforth
Less Jealousie, nay I had almost said,
More Gallantry..



More Gallantry! She cannot doubt my Courage,
This Isle has found it   But Armusia's Lawrels
Bear fresher Date   Yet still I hold her Heart,
And must with him dispute the point of Fame,
And when I have o'ercome him the Field,
His ruin'd Glories mine shall firmer Build.










MY Uncle haunts me up and down, looks Me∣lancholy, wondrous proof-Melancholy, some∣times Swears, then Whistles, Starts, Cries, Groans, as he had got the Botts: I think he has little better. And wou'd sain speak to me; bids me Good-Morrow at Midnight, and Good-Night when it is Noon: Has something hovers about his Brains, that's loath to out.


Still he follows me. How he looks still, and how he beats about like an old Dog at a dead Scent   I marry therewas a sigh to set a Ship a Sailing   These Winds of Love and Honour blow at all ends   Now speak an't be thy will? Good-Morrow Uncle.







This is a new Salute.
Sure h'as forgot me: This Pur-blind Cupid.







Yes, Sir, if I am not chang'd.



I wou'd fain speak with you.



I wou'd fain have you, Sir.



You know I love you:
Next to my self, you stand in all Employments,
Your Counsels, Cares, Assignments with me equal;
So is my study still to plant your Person,
O my Pymero!




Sir, What hangs upon you?
What heavy weight Oppresses you? Y'ave lost
An opportunity to gain a Mistress,
Time will Cure that.



But Oh the Reputation!
To have another get the start in Glory,
What Time cures that?



Your Fame already has enough to live on;
It may be you fear her too, doubt your Mistress
May fall away, or be forced from you.



O she is true, but I undone for ever.
Oh that Armusia, that new thing, that Stranger,
That Flagg stuck up to rob me of my Honour,
That Murdering Chain shot at me from my Country,
That goodly Plague, that I must Court to kill me!



Has he not done a brave Thing?



I confess it, Nephew, must allow it,
But that brave thing has undone me, has sunk me,
Has trod me like a Name in Sand, to nothing;
Hangs betwixt Hopes and me and threats my Ruine:
If he thus rise and blaze, farewel my Fortune.



In Complaisance t'ye Uncle, a Pox-on-him,
And Pox-a-me for saying so, he's brave,
And like enough to hold  



Then I must perish:
Had he set up at any rest but this,
Done any thing but what concern'd my Fame,
The everlasting losing of my Worth  



Which yet you must retrive, I know your Drift.



My Sword is in my hand, my Cause upon't,
And Man to Man, one Valour to another,
My Hope to his.



Why, this is like Ruidias.




The difference of our State flung by, forgotten,
The full opinion, each was won in Service,
Laid handsomly aside, only our Fortunes,
Our single Manhoods.



I conceive you, Sir.



You guess what this means.



Yes, a Portion of Scripture, that has puzled many an
Interpreter.



As soon as you can find him  



That won't be long, Uncle,
And o'my Conscience, he'll be ready as quickly.



Be sure you carry't so, that we may Fight.



Assure your self  




In some such place, where 'tmay be possible
The Princess may behold us.




Upon the Sands behind the Castle, Sir;
A place remote enough, and there are Windows
Out of her Lodging too, or I'm mistaken.



You're in the right   if you can work this handsomly.



Let me alone, I pray you be prepar'd
Some three hours hence.
If you have a few light Prayers that may befriend you  
Run 'em over quickly.



Farewel, Nephew,  
And when we meet again  




I shall dispatch, Sir,   I have seen this Uncle
Curry a Fellows Carcase handsomly,
And in the Head of a Troop, stand as he had been
Rooted there, dealing large Doles of Death  
Success be with him   What a Rascal was that, did
Not not see his Will drawn.









BLess you my royal Daughter,
And in you bless this Island, Heav'n.




What thinkest thou of this Man?



Sure he's a wise man,
And a religious; he tells us things have happen'd
So many years ago almost forgotten,
As readily as if they were come this hour.



Do's he not meet with your sharp Tongue?



He tells me, Madam,
Marriage and mouldy Cheese will make me tamer.



Lady, I would talk with you.







And for your good, for that, that must concern you,
And give ear wisely to me.







You are a Princess of that excellence,
Sweetness and grace, that Angel-like fair feature:
Nay, do not blush, I do not flatter you,
Nor do I dote in telling this; I am amazed, Lady,
And as I think the Gods bestowed these on ye,
The Gods that love ye.



I confess their bounty.



Apply it then to their use, to their honour,
To them and to their service give this sweetness,
They have an instant great use of your goodness;
You are a Saint esteemed here for your beauty;
And many a longing heart  



I seek no fealty,
Nor will I blemish that Heaven hath seal'd on me,
I know my worth. Indeed the Portugals

I have at those commands, and their last Services;
Nay, even their lives; so much I think my Power,
That what I shall enjoyn  




For I perceive ye understand me rightly,
For here the Gods regard your help, and suddenly;


The Portugals, like sharp thorns (mark me, Lady,)
Stick in our sides like Razors, wound Religion,
Draw deep, they wound till the life-blood follows,
Our Gods they spurn at, and their worships scorn,
A mighty hand they bear upon our Government,
These are the men your miracle must work on,
Your Heavenly form either to root them out,
Which as you may endeavour, will be easie,
Remember whose great cause you have to exceute,
To nip their memory, that may not spring more,
Or fairly bring 'em home to our Devotions,
Which will be blessed, and for which you Sainted,
But cannot be, and they go, let me buzzle.



Go up with me,
Where we'll converse more privately;
I'll shew you shortly, how I hold their Temper,
And in what chain their Souls.



Keep fast that, hold still,
And either bring that chain, and those bound in it,
And link it to our Gods, and their fair Worships,
Or Daughter, pinch their hearts a pieces with it,
I'll wait upon your Grace.










If this Prophet were a young thing,
I should suspect him now, he cleaves so close to her,
These holy Coats are long, and hide iniquities.



Away, away Fool; a poor wretch.




Warm but their Stomach once  



Come in, thou art foolish.







I am sorry, Sir, my Fortune is so stubborn,
To court my Sword against my Country-man;
I love my Nation well, and where I find
A Portugal of noble Name and Virtue,
I am his humble Servant, Signiour Pymero,



Your person, nor your Uncle, am Iangry with,
You are both fair Gentlemen, in my opinion,
And I protest I had rather use my Sword
In your defences, than against your safeties;
'Tis methinks, a strange dearth of Enemies,
When we seek Foes amongst our selves.




And ye must make the best on't now, and readiest  



You see I am ready in the place, and Arm'd
To his desire that call'd me.




And I could wish ye had met on Terms more friendly,
But it cannot now be so.




Turn, Sir, and see.



I have kept my word with ye, Uncle,
The Gentleman's ready.








Bid those Fools welcome that affect your courtesie,
I come not to use Complements, ye have wrong'd me,
And ye shall feel, proud man, 'ere I part from ye,
The effects of that, if Fortune do not fool me,
Thy life is mine, and no hope shall redeem it.



That's a proud word,
More than your Faith can justifie.



Sure they will fight.



She's there, I am happy.



Let 'em alone, let 'em kill one another,
These are the main posts, if they fall, the buildings
Will tumble quickly.





No more, be quiet yet.




I am not bloody,
Nor do feel such mortal malice in me,
But since we cannot both enjoy the Princess,
I am resolved to fight.







For if thou faint'st or fail'st  



Do you make all advantages?



All ways unto thy life, I will not spare thee,
Nor look not for thy mercy.



I am arm'd then.



Stand still I charge ye, Nephew, as ye honour me.



And good Emanuel   not  .




For we had not stood idle else.



I am sorry for't.



But since you will have it so  











I marry, this looks handsomly,
This is warm work.



Both fall, an't be thy will.









Stand still, my Sword in  





Now where's your Confidence, your Prayers? quickly,
Your own spite has condemned ye.












Hold, and let him rise,
Spare him for me.



A long life may he enjoy, Lady.



What have you done? 'tis better they had all perish'd.



Peace, Father, I work for thebest; Armusia, meet me
In the Temple, an hour hence.








Now as I live, a Gentleman, at all Inches,
So brave a mingled temper, saw I never.



Why are you sad, Sir? how would this have griev'd ye,
If you had fallen under a profest Enemy?
Under one had taken vantage of your shame too?
Pray you be at peace, I am so far from wronging,
Or glorying in the pride of such Victory,
That I desire to serve you; 'pray' be cheerful.



D'ye hear this, Sir? Why do you hold your head down?


'Tis no High Treason, I take it to be equall'd:
To have a Slip i'the Field no mortal Sin.




You think my Tongue may be your Enemy,
And though restrain'd sometimes out of a Bravery,
May take a privilege to dishonour you.
Believe me, Sir, so much I hate that freedom,
That in a strangers Mouth, 'twill prove an injury,
And I shall right you in't




Let me Curse Fortune yet  
Nephew, your Arm.









SIR, Sir, you must do something suddainly,
To stop his Pride, so great and high he shoots,
Upon his person too, your State sinks else.
You must not stand now on terms of Gratitude,
And let a simple tenderness besot you;
I'll bring you instantly, where you shall see him,
Attempting your fair Sister privately:
Mark but his high behaviour then.







And with what scorn, I fear contempt too,
Against our Deities.







I say, attempting to Corrupt her Soul,
The worst Debauchery   I will not name Lust;
It may be that also.
A little force must be apply'd upon him,
Now, now, apply a little force to humble him;
These kind Caresses do but make him wanton.



Take heed you wrong him not.



Take you heed to your safety,
The freedom of your People; to the Gods:
I but forewarn you, King; if you misdoubt me,
Or think I come unsent  



No, I'll go with you.









MAdam, you see there's nothing I can reach,
Either in my obedience, or my Service,
That can deserve your Love, but I pursue it;
Take pleasure in your will; even in your Anger,
I study new Humility to please you;
And take a kind of Joy in my Afflictions,
Because they come from you.



I know you have deserv'd,
And know that in the Rigour of strict Justice,
I should endeavour to requite your Service,
I know you Love.



If ever Love was mortal,
And dwelt in Man, so fix'd I find it here,
Respect of such a greatness as allows
What I have done already, weak performance,
And unproportion'd to the vast Reward.
It is but just, that who aspires to Heav'n,
Shou'd win it by his worth, and not Sleep to it.




Now, Sir, stand close, to hear, and as you find him,
Believe me right or let Religion suffer.



I dare believe your worth, without additions:
You had my Summons to attend me here,
On some Commands of weight




But point to me the Course, you'd have me Steer,
And if I shrink  



I know you are no Coward;
Then take the outmost Tryal of your Duty;
You hold there's nothing dear that may oblige me,
Doubted or dangerous.




Let me but know, that I may fly into't.



I'll tell you then   Change your Religion,
And be of one Belief with me.








Worship our Gods, renounce the Faith you were bred in.



Ha! I'll die first.



Offer as we do.















Offer to him, I hate!
Offer to Dogs and Cats! To them you offer,
To ev'ry Bird that flies, to every Worm:
Is this the Tryal?



I will reason with you;
Are not our Powers eternal, and their Comforts
As great and full of Hopes, as yours?







Now mark him, Sir, observe him nearly.



Their comforts, like themselves, meer Fictions:
You make 'em Sick, as we are, Peevish, Mad,
Subject to Age, and how can they cure us,
That are not able to refine themselves?



The Sun and Moon we Worship; they are Heavenly.



But I the maker of that Sun and Moon,
That gave those Bodies light, and influence,
That pointed out their Paths, and taught their motions:
Excuse me, Princess, if my Zeal for Truth
Extort a generous Freedom of my Tongue;
What 'ere restraints my private Griefs have born,
Yet for Heav'ns cause I must proclaim aloud.
Take privilege even to oppose your Will,
And call for Justice to th' Eternal due:
I hop'd you wou'd have said, make me a Christian;
Work that great Cure, for 'tis a great one, Princess.
To mortify the Sense, subdue the Will,
Refining Earth to Immortality.


I hop'd your Royal Brother, in return
Of Providence, that by my Arm retriev'd him,
Wou'd have e're this, before the face of Heaven,
Destroy'd those Idol Gods you here adore,
Beat down their Altars, ruin'd these false Temples.



Now Sir.  



I'll hear no more  




Thus far in Charity I was obliged
To rectifie the Errors of your thought,
Nor can the blame be mine to want success,
'Twas by these Pow'ers that I was sworn to wed
The Kings deliverer; these you blaspheme,
Them and their Pow'r you frankly have renounced,
And thereby free me from all Obligation.



You are too just to make this slight Evasion,
And with Religious subtlety destroy.



You shall both find me just, sincere and plain,
Therefore resolve to quit your Faith or me.



My Life and Love forever must be your's,
Butmy Religion Heav'ns.



You heard you Task.



Name any Task but that; extreamest danger,
And certain Death, to gratifie your will;
I dare do any thing but injure Heaven,
And stab th'Almighty's Image in my Soul.
Can I renounce the Power, the whole Creation,
Which every Plant and Element confess,
That gave this very Breath, with which I plead?
Shall I abjure the Author of that Form?
A Temple fit for Angels to inhabit,
When once the mist of Error is withdrawn.



Acknowledge our Belief, and instantly;
For if you let this happy minute pass,
No Recantation shall prevail hereafter.



Call you this Charity?



Nay then.  



You must not go.
What have I done to Merit this hard Sentence?


To have my very Soul rack't, forc't to quit
My Heaven above, or Paradise on Earth?
How well I Love, how much I do prefer
Your Charms to all that's good beneath the Stars,
Truth must declare; but to th'Eternal Being
Can never be Apostate   Heart or Soul
Must perish on this Sea  ; Then sink my Heart,
To save th'Immortal Treasure, thus I quit
Your Love's rich claim, tho while I so resign
No Martyrdom sure ever equall'd mine.



Noble Armusia, I am now confirmed,
In quiting you have gain'd me: I resolv'd
To make the outmost Tryal of your Faith,
And in your Faith of you: I know your Doctrine
Is heavenly all, and you have prov'd the practice.
While her you Love you cou'd for Heaven resign,
The Faith that rules your breast must be Divine,
That Faith and you for ever now are mine.



Is't possible! O unexpected bliss!
Look down ye sacred Quires and share my Joy.




Nay, start not, take my confirmation too,
You had my Promise, Sir, of Recompence,
For your high Service: 'Twas my free consent,
T o let Quisara's hand in Nuptial tye,
Be joyn'd with yours: This Sir was my engagement;
Which in the presence of this holy Man
I ratifie.






What can this mean?



But as the holy Powers that here reside,
Have seen me just to your deserts and you;
To their own Altars they must see me just,
And to those Laws, with which no claim of Friendship
Or Interest can dispense  . Guards seize your Prisoner.



That's well retriev'd; be sure ye bind him fast.



Bind your Restorer, Prince?



Are these the Nuptials
You promised my free Service?




That only can become a Tyrant Fiend,
Such as Ternusa's Governour.








Such vile returns as these, must stagger Nature;
And banish Virtue from the World.




Heavens knows what sense of gratitude I bear,
And to his Friendship how sublime regard:
Had he offended me I had forgiven,
Though to th'attempting of my Life and Crown:
I own them both his gift, but to our Gods,
Our sacred Powers the injury is done,
Basphemed, Reviled.



And think you they will bear it?
I see ripe Vengeance teeming from the Heavens,
If you dispense with this, on you and me,
And all Tedore, whose Marble ribs shall rend
And sink beneath the Main: Spare us kind Powers,
Forgive our impious Clemency, that yet
The proud Blaspemer lives.




Urge not the Vengeance ofthe Gods too far:
Must he needs Dye?



'Tis next to Blasphemy
To make a doubt on't.



True! our most dear affections
Must yield to sacred Laws.



Use all your Violence,
I ask no Mercy nor recant my Words.



His Virtue serves a Power will give him strength
To scorn your Idol-Gods.








Know King that if your Laws require his Blood,
They challenge mine; our Love and Faith are One.




Quisara too! O Sister wound not thus
My tortured Heart? Good Father, your assistance.


What means this frenzy?



These are tokens, Sir,
The Gods displeasure is gone out; be quick,
And e'er it fall, do something to appease them.




Quisara own his Faith! What must be done,



They must die both, in Sacrifi•e, and instantly;
To those dread Powers they have blasphemed:
It makes me weep to urge their Punishment.



Most Gracious and Compassionate Soul.



Yet if you mitigate or defer their doom,
I then must Curse you from the Gods;
Call up their Vengeance from the flaming Lake,
And hurl it on your Land; I have charge for it!



Bear them to Justice, for I dare not trust
My Nature with the Parly: Your hand Father.
Our Gods exact their Blood and they must Die;
Yet shall their Obsequies this comfort have,
Their Judge shall be their Mourner   O support me.



My Heart akes too.



Manent Armusia, Quisara, Guards.




Was never known. Princess, I have betrayedyou,
But to eternal rest.



Our Souls shall meet,
And celebrate in Paradise their Nuptials.



Seraphick Maid? Thy Name shall stand recorded
With Virgin-Saints, the first in Vertue's Roll,
Through many years experience they arriv'd.
Consumate Piety, with matchless speed,
You take you Progress on the sacred way,
A Convert and a Martyr in a Day.






ACT V. SCENE I.
A Grove.
An Idol, and Altar of Thor, at distance.




I Am ungrateful, and a wretch, (persuade me not)
Forgetful of the mercy he shew'd me,
The timely noble Pity. Why shou'd I,
Why should I make him die, who set me free?
Why shou'd it come from me? Why, I command it?
Will not all Tongues, and Truths call me ungrateful?



Had the offencebeen aim'd at you, 'tis certain
It had been in you power, and your discretion,
To have turn'd it into Mercy, and forgiven it;
It then had shew'd a vertuous point of Gratitude.
Timely and nobly paid; But since the Cause
Concerns the Honour of the Gods, their Title,
'Tis in their Wills, their Mercies, or Revenges:
And these Revolts in you show plain Rebellion.



They are mild and pitiful.







Their Natures soft, and tender.




That feel compunction for their Trespasses:
This pair defies 'em still, threaten destruction
And demolition to their Arms and Worship;
Therefore take heed, Sir, that you be not found,
And mark'd a favourer of their Dishonour:
They use no common Justice.




But see; behold the Pomp of Death comes on!
What shall I do to merit of this Man.
I'll once more try if I can fairly win 'em.








Because I love you tenderly and dearly,
And wou'd be glad to win you mine; I wish you,
Ev'n from my heart, I wish and wooe you  




Take heed how you persuade me falsly, then you hate me;
Take heed how you intrap me.




And tenderly and truly I advise you,
Both for your Souls health and your safety.




And name my Soul no more; she is too precious,
Too glorious for your flatteries; too secure too.



Consider the reward, Sir, and the honour
That is prepar'd, the Glory you shall grow to.



They are not to be considered in these Cases,
Not to be nam'd when Souls are question'd;
They are vain and flying Vapours: Touch my Life,
'Tis ready for you, put it to what Test
It shall please you, I am patient; but for the rest  



We must use Tortures then.



Your worst, and painfull'st
I am joyful to accept.



You must our sharpest;
For such has been your hate against our Deities,
Deliver'd openly; your threats, and scornings;
And either your Repentance must be mighty,
Which is your free Conversion to our Customs,
Or equal punishment, which is your life, Sir.



I am glad I have it for you; take it, Priest,
And all the Misery that shall attend it:
Let the Gods glut themselves with Christian Blood,
It will be ask'd again, and so far follow'd,


So far reveng'd, and with such holy Justice,
Your Gods of Gold shall melt and sink before it;
Your Altars and your Temples shake to nothing,
And you, false Worshippers, blind Fools of Ceremonies,
Shall seek for Holes to hide your heads and fears in;
For Seas to swallow you from this Destruction;
Darkness to dwell about you and conceal you.



Make the Fires ready,
And bring the several Tortures out.




And fear'em not; you that have stept so nobly
Into this pious Tryal, start not now:
Keep on your way, a Virgin will assist you,
A Virgin, won by your fair constancy,
And glorying that she is won, so will die with you.



Let me begin my Triumph;
Come, clap your Terrors on.



All your fell Tortures;
For there is nothing he shall suffer, Brother,
I swear by my new Faith, which is most sacred,
And I will keep it so, but I will follow in,
And follow to a scruple of affliction.
In spite of all your Gods, without prevention.



S'Death, she amazes me!



What shall be done now?



They must die both,
And suddenly, they will corrupt all else.
Go you in, Sir, I'll see the Execution.




You injur'd Powers, that I permit you justice;
But for the sight  



You are excus'd for that,
I'll bear that Torture for you; good Sir, in;
You see all's ready, Sir, and we must strike
Before your Eyes else.



Well, what must be



As the King is going off, and the Priests address to their Work, the whole Company is Alarmed by the noise of great Guns.
Enter a Messenger.




Seek for defence, the Castle Plays, and Thunders,
Our Town Rocks, and our Houses fly in Air,
The people die for fear; General Ruidias

Has sent t'inform us, he'll not leave a Stone,
No, not the memory there has stood a City,
Unless Armusia be deliver'd fairly.



Father, what can our Gods do for us now?




Ruidias do this! what, to free Armusia,

His Rival? 'tis impossible.



This was his Summons,
Which still you hear him Thunder from the Fort.



Wou'd I were safe at home again.


Leave me to see the Execution done,
While you return and fortifie the Palace:
Nothing but mischief, till th'incensed Powers
Are satisfied with these Blasphemers Blood;
Earthquakes and Hurricanes will seize us next:
Dispatch, dispatch there.



By Heaven I'll rule in this: they shall not die,
Till I have seen this furious Storm allay'd,
Bear back the Prisoners to the Palace, Guards;
All to your charge, how desperately they Thunder!




Brave Ruidias, this is like a Souldier,
A Portuguese and Christian, to do favours
Without the form of promise.



'Tis but a debt of Honour nobly paid.



Plague on your bellowing.







Blessus, what a Thundring is here! What Fire-spitting! We can't drink but the Cans are maul'd out of our hands.



I wou'd they wou'd maul our scores too. A shame of their Guns, how devilishy they bounce! and how the Bullets borrow the side of a House here, and there another, and mend those up again with another Ward!



I had the roof of my House taken off with a Chain∣shot, and half an hour after, I found another standing in the room on't.



We shall make a wonderful Siege on't, if we talk at this rate.



You think he lyesnow: why, I have seen a Steeple taken off, and another clapt i'th-place, with twenty Men ringing the Bells in't.







Why then, we shall not know our own Streets a∣gain.



Nor where to pay our Duties. I hope I shou'd love Chain-shot the better as long as I live, for that good turn, i'Faith: I know not, it may fall out so; for these Guns make strange work. Here flies a Powdring tub; and there the Soldiers go together by the Ears, for the Meat in't: There flies the Roast-meat, spit and all: here a Barrel pisses Vinegar.



A Vengeance fire 'em all.



They fire fast enough; they need no help.



Are these the Portugal Bulls? How loud they Bel∣low?



Their Horns are wonderful strong, they push down Palaces; they toss our little habitations like Whelps, like Trundle-tails, with their Hells upwards: All the Win∣dows in the Town dance Trenchmore; 'Tis like to prove a blessed Age for Glasiers; I met a Hand and a Hand and a Letter in't, in great hast; and by and by, a Leg running after it, as if the hand had forgot part of its errand.



Heads fly like Foot-balls every where: What shall we do?



I care not, my Shop's cancell'd, and all the Pots and Pipkins vanished; there was a single Bullet and they, to∣gether by the Ears, you would have thought Tom Tum∣bler, and all his Troop of Devils had been there.



Well, for my part, I'll to the Templeand pray for you all: I tell you Neighbours, I trouble Heaven so seldom, that sure I may be heard, when I come. For I begin to like this Por∣tugals Kerson Religion: What can these Worm-eaten Gods of ours do for us?



Worm-eaten Gods! I tell you, Neighbour, you do our Gods wrong, and me wrong: I made 'em of the best season'd Timber the Island wou'd afford.



But do the Cannon Bullets think there is no Law?



No, nor Gospel neither; Law, prithee run to a Gra∣nado, when it comes piping hot out of a Mortar-piece into the Town, and tell it there's Law; 'twill seratch they face for thee, worse than e'er thy Wife did. Law! I do but think, what Lanes a Chain-shot wou'd make in the Law! And how like an Ass a Judge wou'd sit upon the Bench, with his head shot off.



Let's to the King, and get this Gentleman deliver'd handsomely, by this hand there's no walking above ground else.



By this Leg, (let me swear nimbly by it, for I know not how long) if I were out o'th'Town, if I came in again to fetch my Breakfast, I'd give 'em leave to cram me with a Portugal Pudding. But come Neighbours, our best way will be to go to the Insurance-Office and compound: I am a Fencer; I'll give 'em one Arm, to secure t'other. Thou art a Dancing-Master; thou shalt give thy Head to secure thy Heels.







Because that's of least use to thee, of any thing about thee: So every Man shall give aw•y the rest of his Body, to Insure the Limbs that are of most use in his calling.





Art' sure it was the blind Priest?




He has provok'd all this: The King is merciful,
And wondrous loving, but he fires him on still,
And when he cools inrages him; I know it:
Threatens new Vengeance, and the Gods fierce Justice,
When he but looks with fair Eyes on Armufia;

Will lend him no time to relent; my Royal Mistress,
She has entertain'd a Christian hope.







Nay 'tis most true; but Lord, how he lies at her,
And threatens her, and flatters her, and damns her;
And I fear, if not speedily prevented;
If she continues stout, both shall be executed.



I'll kiss thee for this News: Nay, poor Panura,

If thou wilt give me leave, I'll get thee with Christian;
The best way to convert thee.



Make me believe so.



I will I'faith: But which way cam'st thou hither?
The Palace is close guarded and barricado'd.



I camethrough a private Vault, which few there know of,
It rises in a Temple not far hence,
Close by the Castle here.



How   To what end?




To give you knowledge of my new born Mistress,
And in what doubt Armusia stands:
Think any present means, or hope, to stop 'em
From their fell ends. The Princes are come in too,
And they are hard'ned also.



The damn'd Priest.  



Sure he's a cruel Man? Methinks Religion
Shou'd teach more temperate Lessons.




He dare to touch at such fair Lives as theirs are!
Well, Prophet, I Prophecy I shall catch you,


When all your Prophesies will not redeem you:
Wilt thou do one thing bravely?



Any good I am able.



And by thy own white hand, swear thou art Vertuous,
And a brave Wench, durst thou but guide me presently
Through the same Vault thou cam'st into the Palace,
And those I shall appoint, such as I shall think fit.



Yes, I will do it, and suddenly and truly.



I would fain behold this Prophet.



Now I have you.
And I shall bring you where you shall behold him,
Alone too, and unfurnish'd of Defences:
That shall be my Care; but you must not betray me.



Dost think we are so base? Such slavish Rogues?




And you shall see how fairly I'll work for you.



I must needs steal that Priest,
Steal him, and hang him.



Do any thing to remove his Mischiefs, strangle him.







You'll offer me no foul Play.
The Vault is dark.







And you may  .
But I hold you honest.



Honest enough, I'll warrant thee.



I am but a poor weak Wench; and what with the Place,
And your Perswasion Sir,   But I hope you will not.
You know we are often Cozen'd.



If thou dost fear me,
Why dost thou put me in mind?



To let you know, Sir,
Though it be in your Power, and things sitting to it,
Yet a true Gentleman  



I know what he'll do?
Come, and remember me, and I'll answer thee;
I'll answer to the full: wee'll call at the Castle,
And then, my good guide, do thy Will, 'shalt find me
A very tractable Man.



I hope I shall, Sir.





Let my Men guard the Gates.



And mine the Temple,
For fear the honour of our Gods shou'd suffer;
And on your lives be watchful.




And lets see if these Portugals dare enter,
What their high hearts dare do; let's see how readily
The great Ruidias will redeem his Countryman:
He speaks proud Words and Threatens.



He is approv'd, Sir,
And will put fair for what he promises:
I cou'd wish friendlier Terms;
Yet for our Liberties, and for our Gods,
We are bound in our best Services,
Even in the hazard of our Lives.





And give your Counsels, and your helps; the Fort still
Plays fearfully upon us, beats our buildings,
And turns our People wild with fears.



Send for the Prisoner, and give us leave to argue.








And let the Fort Play still: we are strong enough
To look upon 'em, and return at pleasure;
It may be on our view they will return him.



How the People stare!
And some cry, some pray, and some curse heartily;
But it is the King    



I cannot blame their Wisdom.
They are all above, Armusia chain'd and bound too!
O, these are thankful Squires.





Command thy Cannon instantly to cease,
No more to trouble the afficted People,
Or suddenly Armusia's head goes off,
As suddenly as said:
Stay and be Temperate.



Do nothing that's dishonourable, brave Ruidias;

Let not the care of me restrain your Valour;
Pursue 'em still, they are base malicious People.



Be not thus desperate.



I scorn your courtesies,
Strike when you dare, a fair aim guide the Gunner,
And may he still let fly with Fortune. Friend,
Do me the honour of a Souldiers Funeral,
The last fair Christian Rites, see me i'th'ground;
Then make these Idol Temples burn,
On their scorn'd Gods erect my Monument;
Touch not the Princess, as you are a Souldier.



Your fate, Sir, must be mine; one Life, one Death.



Be wise, and beg for Truce yet.



Let our Cannon Answer.




So resolute! Draw all our Forces out,
And make the General Assault.

As the Guards Sallv, they are met by Pymero and his Party, who bring the Governour.


No, no, go on;
Look here's your God and Prophet.



Heaven, I'm amaz'd! How came he taken?



I conjur'd for him, King;
I'm a sure Cur at an old blind Prophet,


I'll hunt you such a false Knave admirably,
A Terrier I; I Earth'd him, and then Snapt him.



By your good favour, Sir, we stole him,
Ev'n from the next Chamber to you.



I am amaz'd at these mens courage, Guards,
Rescue our Prophet first, then storm the Fort.



Come, come, begin, King,

Begin this bloody contest, when you please,
Your Minion first shall go to th' Dogs:
And yet I soorn my Sword should touch the Rascal.
We'll tear him piece-meal thus before you   Ha!





Art thou a Prophet? What a dangerous Mist
Have I been wrapt in! Noble Ruidias,

Our strife is at an end; I was abus'd,
My dear Armusia, O my injur'd Sister,
What shall I urge in my defence? Ruidias,

Descend in peace, and meet me, on a Kings word.

King and his Company, Ruidias and his, come down upon the Stage.


This isa precious Prophet! Why, Don Govenour,
What makes you here? how long have you taken Orders?



I can't speak for wonder.



I had paid you all,
But Fortune plaid the Jade.




Y'have half persuaded me to be a Christian.
Once more, Armusia, let me do you justice.



Which I, Sir, needs must own, tho' once your Rival.





You have in Honour started now beyond me,
'Twas my Ambition but to quit the score.



And Fortune made me blest with the occasion.



To Prison with that wretch, there let him howl•



And, if he can repent, sigh out his Villanies:
His Island we shall seize into our Hands,
His Father and himself have both usurpt it,
And kept it by Oppression; the Town and Castle
(In which I lay my self most miserably,
Till my most honourable Friend redeem'd me)
Signior Pymero, I bestow on you;
The rest of next Command upon these Gentlemen,
And on you all, my Love.



I am o'er-prest with Fortune, past my Merit.



Our Court and Island, Sir, shall share your Joy;
Our interests are one; let Mirth and Triumph,
And Universal gladness freely flow.
What ever false and subtile men dare cast,
Just Heav'n on Vertue show'rs rewards at last.
