whereas you write my fortune and my birth 
make above you may be a real cause 
that I must leave you know thou worthy man 
thou have a soul who plenteous wealth supply 
all the lean want blind chance have deal to thou 
yet can I think the god from all their store 
who never know indigence unto their will 
will out of all their stock of virtue leave 
or out of all new grace they can make 
make such another piece as Scudmore be 
then may he just fear but otherwise 
soon the masculine element of fire 
shall flame his pyramid down to the earth 
soon her mountain shall swell up to heaven 
or soft April shower quench fire in hell 
soon shall star from this circumference 
drop like false fiery exhalation 
than I be false to vow make unto thou 
in who aught never a fault I never can see 
but that you doubt once my constancy 

if what I feel I can express in word 
methinks I can speak joy enough to man 
to banish sadness from all love forever 
o thou that reconcile the fault of all 
that frothy sex and in thy single self 
confine nay haste engross virtue enough 
to frame a spacious world of virtuous woman 
have thou be the beginning of thy sex 
I think the devil in the serpent skin 
have want cunning to overcome thy goodness 
and all have live and die in innocency

that owe a sensible member but must dwell 
awhile on such a object 
the pass horse and the feed kine 
stand still and leave their journey and their food

which shall light near she for her clear eye 
deceive even man they be so like bright sky 
near in a rivulet swim two beauteous swan 
white than any thing but her neck and hand 
which they leave straight to comfort she a bull 
be bait on the green for the swain sport 
she walk towards it the vex savage beast 
cease bellow the snarl dog be mute 
and have enough to do to look on she 
who face bring concord and a end of jar 
though nature make they ever to have war 
have there be bear and lion when she speak 
they have be charm too for grecian lute 
be rustic music to her heavenly tongue 
who sweetness even cast slumber on my eye 
soft as content yet will not let i sleep

I build again upon a woman faith 
may sense forsake i I will soon trust 
dice or a reconcile enemy o God 
what a internal joy my heart have feel

be thou not marry it be impossible 
o no I do despise thou and will fly 
as far on earth as to the antipode 
and by some learned magician who deep art 
can know thy residence on this hemisphere 
there I will be place my foot just against thou 
to express the opposite nature which our heart 
must henceforth hold 

o rather shoot i friend 
then let i hear thou speak such bitterness 
o pity i redeem from the hell 
that in this marriage I be like to feel 
I will rather fly to barren wilderness 
and suffer all want with thou Scudmore then 
live with all plenty in this husband arm

that be transport with vain dignity 
o thy dear word have knock at my heart gate 
and enter they have pluck the devil vizard 
that do deform this face and blind my soul 
off and thy Bellafront present herself 
lave in a bath of contrite virginal tear 
clothe in the original beauty that be thou 
now for thy love to God count this not do 
let time go back and be as when before it 
or from thy memory race it for ever 

ha ha ha be there ever such strange creature frame 
why do thou speak such foolish senseless thing 
can thy forsake he redeem thy fault 
no I will never mend a ill with worse 
why this example will make woman false 
when they shall hear it that before be true 
for after ill example we do fly 
but must be vow to deed of piety 
o woman woman woman woman woman

how happy have you not shall we have be 
false where you kiss but murder in your ire 
love all that woe know all man you desire 
ungrateful yet most impudent crave 
torturous as hell insatiate as the grave 
lustful as monkey grin in your ease

more vain proud than fool as ignorant 
base than parasite witch that enchant 
and make we senseless to think death or life 
be you to give when only our belief 
do make you able to deceive we so 
beget by drunkard to breed sin and woe 
as many foul disease hide your vein

not quick in wit fit to perform least good 
but to subvert whole state shed sea of blood 
twice as deceitful as be crocodile 
for you betray both way with tear and smile 
yet questionless there be as good as bad 
hence let i go

have wound all the faith my sex do owe 
but will recover it or pay my life

first unto he and so sir Abraham now 
I hope will buy the pool where I will fish 
thus a quick knave make a fat fool his dish Exit

as true a rogue as thyself thou wrong i send your man away go to I have strange and welcome business to impart the merchant be dead for shame let we walk into the field send away your man 

how 

here be a letter from the lusty Kate 
that tell you all I must not give it you 
but upon some condition let we walk 
and send away your man 

go sirrah and bespeak supper at the bear and provide oar I will see gravesend tonight Exit 

the gentlewoman will run mad after you then I will tell you more let we walk Exit 

by my sad heart I be and not a tittle 
of my relation to thou wrong or feign 

introth you be too blame to venture so 
mischief find we we need not mischief seek 
I be not tie to that opinion 
they be like woman which do always shun 
their lover and pursuer and do follow 
with most rank appetite they that do fly 
all mischief that I have be but one woman 
and that one woman all mischance to i 
who speak worst of they then be the best of man 
they be like shadow mischief be like they 
death fear i for introth I seek he out 
the sun be stale to i tomorrow morn 
as this it will rise I see no difference 
the night do visit i but in one robe 
she bring as many thought as she wear star 
when she be pleasant but no rest at all 
for what new strange thing shall I covet life then 
be not she false who only I think true 
shall time to show his strength make Scudmore live 
till perish the vicious thought I love not thou 
or thou dear friend remove thy heart from i 

time be as weak for that as he be old 
take comfort and attend this counsel friend 
this match be neither sacred nor sure 
close fate annihilate what opinion make 
and since she be resolve this night to die 
if you do not redeem she give the mean 
or her blood credit i will spring heavy grief 
sore and strange in thy oppress heart 
then her false love before beside it be you 
my Scudmore that be false if you will not 
consent to let she make vow good which be 
but in a possibility to be break 
this her repentance cast her vice quite off 
and if you leave she now you take it on 
nay you incur a bloody mortal sin 
you do become a actual murderer 
if you neglect she she will kill herself 
this night by poison knife or other mean 
God give you power to cross her desperate will 
and if you save not where you may you kill 

why can my noble and wise friend think still 
that what a woman say her heart do mean 
can you believe that she will kill herself 
it be a full hour since she speak the word 
and God forbid that any woman mind 
shall not be change and change in a long hour 
she be by this time in her Lordly arm 
and like please Juno clasp by jupiter 
forget the plaint of poor mortality 
such state such pride as poet show she in 
incense with jove loose escape upon the earth 
she cast on i at our encounter 
as cold and heavy as a rock of ice 
in her love to i which while I there stay 
my bitter and hot word resolve a little 
just as the sun do ice I soften she 
and make she drown her fault in her own tear 
but think you she hold this flexible vain 
no I i remove and she be congeal again 

how well do Scudmore speak ill for himself 
wit be a disease that fit employment want 
therefore we see those happy in best part 
and underbear fortune under their merit 
grow to a sullen envy hate and scorn 
of their superior and at last like wind 
break forth into rebellious civil war 
or private treason none so apt for these 
as melancholy wit fetter with need 
how free be the rustic swain from these assault 
he never feel a passion all his life 
but when he can sleep or hunger gripe 
and though he want reason wit art nay sense
