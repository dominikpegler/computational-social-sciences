now will the two sun of our roman heaven 
Pompey and Caesar in their Tropic burn 
with their contention all the cloud assemble 
that threaten tempest to our peace and empire 
which we shall short see pour down in blood 
civil and natural wild and barbarous turn 

from whence presage you this 

from both their army 
now gather near our Italy contend 
to enter several Pompey bring so near 
by Rome consent for fear of tyrannous Caesar 
which Caesar fear to be do in favour 
of Pompey and his passage to the empire 
have bring on he for intervention 
and such a flock of puttock follow Caesar 
for fall of his illdisposed purse 
that never yet spare cross to Aquiline virtue 
as well may make all civil spirit suspicious 
look how against great rain a stand pool 
of paddock toad and watersnake put up 
their speckle throat above the venomous lake 
croak and gasp for some fresh fall drop 
to quench their poison thirst be near to stifle 
with clotter purge of their own foul bane 
so still where Caesar go there thrust up head 
impostor flatterer favourite and bawd 
buffoon intelligencer select wit 
close murderer mountebank and decay thief 
to gain their baneful life relief from he 
from Britain Belgia France and Germany 
the scum of either country chuse by he 
to be his black guard and red agent here 
swarm about he 

and all these be say 
to be suborn in chief against yourself 
since Caesar chief fear that you will sit 
this day his opposite in the cause for which 
both you be send for home and he have steal 
access so soon here Pompey whole rest raise 
to his encounter and on both side Rome 
in general uproar 

which sir if you see 
and know how for the danger all suspect 
to this your worthy friend for that know freedom 
his spirit will use this day against both the rival 
his wife and family mourn no food no comfort 
allow they for his danger you will use 
your utmost power to stay he from the senate 
all this day session 

he be too wise Statilius 
for all be nothing 

Nothing sir I see 
Castor and Pollux temple thrust up full 
with all the damn crew you have late name 
the market place and suburb swarm with they 
and where the senate sit be ruffian point 
to keep from enter the degree that go 
up to the bench all other but the consul 
Caesar and Pompey and the senator 
and all for no cause but to keep out Cato 
with any violence any villainy 
and be this nothing sir be his one life 
on who all good life and their good depend 
in Rome whole empire all the justice there 
that be free and simple all such virtue too 
and all such knowledge nothing nothing all 

away Statilius how long shall thy love 
exceed thy knowledge of i and the god 
who right thou wrong for my right have not 
their power to guard i in a cause of they 
their justice and integrity include 
in what I stand for he that fear the god 
for guard of any goodness all thing fear 
earth sea and air heaven darkness broad daylight 
rumor and silence and his very shade 
and what a aspen soul have such a creature 
how dangerous to his soul be such a fear 
in who cold fit be all heaven justice shake 
to his faint thought and all the goodness there 
due to all good man by the god own vow 
nay by the firmness of their endless be 
all which shall fail as soon as any one 
good to a good man in they for his goodness 
proceed from they and be a beam of they 
o never more Statilius may this fear 
taint thy bold bosom for thyself or friend 
more than the god be fearful to defend 

Come let he go Statilius and your fright 
this man have inward guard past your young sight exeunt 

welcome come stand by i in what be fit 
for our poor city safety nor respect 
her proud foe corruption or our danger 
of what see face soever 

I be you 
but what alas sir can the weakness do 
against our whole state of we only two 
you know our statist spirit be so corrupt 
and servile to the great that what cross 
they or their own particular wealth or honour 
they will not enterprise to save the empire 

I know it yet let we do like ourselves exeunt 

move you for enter only Pompey army 
which if you gain for he for i all justice 
will join with my request of enter i 

it be like so and I purpose to enforce it 

but may we not win Cato to our friendship 
by honour speech nor persuasive gift 

not possible 

nor by enforcive usage 

not all the violence that can be use 
of power or set authority can stir he 
much less fair word win or reward corrupt he 
and therefore all mean we must use to keep he 
from off the bench 

give you the course for that 
and if he offer entry I have fellow 
will serve your will on he at my give signal 

he be the man that sit so close to Caesar 
and hold the law there whisper see the cowherd 
have guard of arm man get against one naked 
I will part their whisper virtue 

hold keep out 

what honour Cato enter choose thy place 

Come in 
away unworthy groom 

no more 

what shall one say to he 

he will be stoical 

where fit place be not give it must be take 

do take it Cato fear no great of they 
thou seek the people good and these their own 

brave Cato what a countenance he put on 
let we give his noble will our utmost power 

be bold in all thy will for be just 
thou may defy the god 

say like a God 

we must endure these people 

do begin 

consul and reverend father and you people 
who voice be the voice of the god 
I here have draw a law by good consent 
for enter into Italy the army 
of Rome great Pompey that his force here 
as well as he great Rome may rest secure 
from danger or the yet still smoke fire 
of Catiline abhor conspiracy 
of which the very chief be leave alive 
only chastise but with a gentle prison 

put they to death then and strike dead our fear 
that well you urge by their unfit survival 
rather than keep it quick and two life give it 
by entertain Pompey army too 
that give as great cause of our fear as they 
for their conspiracy only be to make 
one tyrant over all the state of Rome 
And Pompey army suffer to be enter 
be to make he or give he mean to be so 

it follow not 

in purpose clear sir 
which I will illustrate with a clear example 
if it be day the sun be above the earth 
which follow not you will answer for it be day 
when first the morning break and yet be then 
the body of the sun beneath the earth 
but he be virtual above it too 
because his beam be there and who then know not 
his golden body will soon after mount 
So Pompey army enter Italy 
yet Pompey be not in Rome but Pompey beam 
who see not there and consequent he 
be in all mean enthrone in the empery 

example prove not we will have the army 
of Pompey enter 

we which we intend you 
have you already buy the people voice 
or bear our consul or our senate here 
so small love to their country that their will 
beyond their country right be so perverse 
to give a tyrant here entire command 
which I have prove as clear as day they do 
if either the conspirator survive 
be let to live or Pompey army enter 
both which beat one sole path and threat one danger 

consul and honour father the sole entry 
of Pompey army I will not yet examine 
but for the great conspirator yet live 
which Cato will conclude as oneself danger 
to our dear country and deter all therefore 
that love their country from their life defence 
I see no reason why such danger hang 
on their save life be still safe keep in prison 
and since close prison to a roman freedom 
ten fold torment more than direct death 
who can be think to love the less his country 
that seek to save their life and lest myself 
thus speak for they be unjust touch 
with any less doubt of my country love 
why reverend father may it be esteem 
self praise in i to prove myself a chief 
both in my love of she and in desert 
of her like love in i for he that do 
most honour to his mistress well may boast 
without least question that he love her most 
and though thing long since do be long since know 
and so may seem superfluous to repeat 
yet be forget as thing never do 
their repetition needful be in justice 
to enflame the shame of that oblivion 
for hope it will seem no less impair 
to other act to true tell my own 
put all together I have pass they all 
that by their act can boast themselves to be 
their country lover first in those wild kingdom 
subdue to Rome by my unwearied toil 
which I dissavage and make noble civil 
next in the multitude of those rude realm 
that so I fashion and to Rome young empire 
of old have add then the battle number 
this hand have fight and win for she with all 
those infinite of dreadful enemy 
I slay in they twice fifteen hundred thousand 
all able soldier I have drive at once 
before my force and in sundry onset 
a thousand thousand of they put to sword 
beside I take in less than ten year time 
by strong assault above eight hundred city 
three hundred several nation in that space 
subdue to my country all which service 
I trust may interest i in her love 
public and general enough to acquit i 
of any selflove past her common good 
for any motion of particular justice 
by which her general empire be maintain 
that I can make for those accuse prisoner 
which be but by the way that so the reason 
Metellus make for enter Pompey army 
may not more weighty seem than to agree 
with those imprison noble vital safety 
which grant or but yield fit to be 
may well extenuate the necessity 
of enter Pompey army 

all that need 
I take away before and reason give 
for a necessity to keep it out 
who entry I think he himself affect not 
since I as well think he affect not the empire 
and both those thought hold since he love his country 
in my great hope of he too well to seek 
his sole rule of she when so many soul 
so hard a task approve it nor my hope 
of his sincere love to his country build 
on sandy ground than Caesar since he can 
as good card show for it as Caesar do 
and quit therein the close aspersion 
of his ambition seek to employ 
his army in the breast of Italy 

let i not thus imperial bench and senate 
feel myself beat about the ear and toss 
with other breathe to any coast they please 
and not put some stay to my error in they 
the god can witness that not my ambition 
have bring to question the entry of my army 
and therefore not suspect the effect 
of which that entry be suppose the cause 
which be a will in i to give my power 
the rule of Rome sole empire that most strange 
will put my will in other power and power 
unforfeit by my fault in other will 
my selflove out of which all this must rise 
I will not wrong the know proof of my love 
to this my native city public good 
to quit or think of nor repeat those proof 
confirm in those three triumph I have make 
for conquest of the whole inhabit world 
first Africa Europe and then Asia 
which never consul but myself can boast 
nor can blind fortune vaunt her partial hand 
in any part of all my service 
though some have say she be the page of Caesar 
both sail march fight and prepare 
his fight in very order of his battle 
the part she play for he invert nature 
as give calmness to the enrgage sea 
impose summer weather on stern winter 
wing the slow foot he do command 
and his most cowherd make fierce of hand 
and all this ever when the force of man 
be quite exceed in it all and she 
in the instant add she clear deity 
yet she for i I both disclaim and scorn 
and where all fortune be renounce no reason 
will think one man transfer with affectation 
of all Rome empire for he must have fortune 
that go beyond a man and where so many 
their handful find with it the one be mad 
that undergo it and where that be clear 
the impute mean to it which be my suit 
for entry of my army I confute 

what rest then this of all part be disclaim 

my part sir rest that let great Pompey bear 
what spirit he list it be needful yet for Rome 
that this law be establish for his army 

it be then as needful to admit in i 
or else let both lay down our arm for else 
to take my charge off and leave Pompey his 
you wrongful accuse i to intend 
a tyranny among you and shall give 
Pompey full mean to be himself a tyrant 

can this be answer 

be it then your will 
that Pompey shall cease arm 

what else 

no no 

shall Caesar cease his arm 

ay I 

for shame 
then yield to this clear equity that both 
may leave their arm 

we indifferent stand 

Read but this law and you shall see a difference 
betwixt equity and your indifferency 
all man objection answer read it notary 

he shall not read it 

I will read it then 

nor thou shall read it be a thing so vain 
pretend cause for Pompey army entry 
that only by thy complice and thou 
it be forge to set the senate in a uproar 

I have it sir in memory and will speak it 

thou shall be dumb as soon 

pull down this Cato 
author of faction and to prison with he 

come down sir he draw and all draw 

hence you mercenary ruffian 

what outrage show you sheath your insolent sword 
or be proclaim your country foe and traitor 

how insolent a part be this in you 
to offer the imprisonment of Cato 
when there be right in he be form so answer 
with term and place to send we both to prison 
if of our own ambition we shall offer 
the entry of our army for who know 
that of we both the best friend to his country 
and free from his own particular end 
be in his power will not assume the empire 
and have it can rule the state so well 
as now it be govern for the common good 

accuse yourself sir if your conscience urge it 
or of ambition or corruption 
or insufficiency to rule the empire 
and sound not i with your lead 

lead it be gold 
and spirit of gold too to the politic dross 
with which false Caesar sound man and for which 
his praise and honour crown they who sound not 
the inmost sand of Caesar for but sand 
be all the rope of your great part affect 
you speak well and be learn and golden speech 
do nature never give man but to guild 
a copper soul in he and all that learning 
that hearty be spend in paint speech 
be mere paint and no solid knowledge 
but you have another praise for temperance 
which nought commend your free choice to be temperate 
for so you must be at least in your meal 
since you have a malady that tie you to it 
for fear of daily fall in your aspire 
and your disease the god never give to man 
but such a one as have a spirit too great 
for all his body passage to serve it 
which note the excess of your ambition 
the malady chance where the pore and passage 
through which the spirit of a man be bear 
so narrow be and straight that oftentimes 
they intercept it quite and choke it up 
and yet because the greatness of it note 
a heat mere fleshly and of blood rank fire 
goat be of all beast subject to it most 

yourself may have it then if those fault cause it 
but deal this man ingenious to tax 
man with a frailty that the god inflict 

the god inflict on man disease never 
or other outward maim but to decipher 
correct and order some rude vice within they 
and why decipher they it but to make 
man note and shun and tax it to the extreme 
nor will I see my country hope abuse 
in any man command in her empire 
if my more trial of he make i see more 
into his intricacy and my freedom 
have spirit to speak more than observer servile 

be free sir of your insight and your speech 
and speak and see more than the world beside 
I must remember I have hear of one 
that fame give out can see through oak and stone 
and of another set in Sicily 
that can discern the carthaginian navy 
and number they distinct leave harbour 
though full a day and night fail distant thence 
but these thing reverend father I conceive 
hardly appear to you worth grave belief 
and therefore since such strange thing have be see 
in my so deep and foul detraction 
by only lyncean Pompey who be most 
love and believe of Rome most famous whore 
infamous Flora by so fine a man 
as Galba or sarmentus any jester 
or flatterer may draw through a lady ring 
by one that all his soldier call in scorn 
great Agamemnon or the king of man 
I rest unmoved with he and yield to you 
to right my wrong or his abuse allow 

my lord you make all Rome amaze to hear

excellent be ever great office better supply exeunt 
now be the mighty empress of the earth 
great Rome fast lock up in her fancy strength 
all break in uproar fear the just god 
in plague will drown she so abuse blessing 
in which fear all without her wall fly in 
by both their jar champion rush out 
and those that be within as fast fly forth 
the consul both be flee without one rite 
of sacrifice submit to the god 
as ever heretofore their custom be 
when they begin the bloody fright of war 
in which our two great soldier now encounter 
since both left Rome oppose in bitter skirmish 
Pompey not will yet to hazard battle 
by Cato counsel urge good cause flee 
which fire Caesar spirit he pursue 
so home and fierce that great Pompey scorn 
the heart he take by his advise flight 
despise advice as much as his pursuit 
and as in Lybia a age lion 
urge from his peaceful covert fear the light 
with his unready and disease appearance 
give way to chase a while and cold hunt 
till with the youthful hunter wanton heat 
he all his cool wrath fret into a flame 
and then his side he swing with his stern 
to lash his strength up let we down all his brow 
about his burn eye erect his mane 
break all his throat in thunder and to wreak 
his hunter insolence his heart even bark 
he free his fury turn and rush back 
with such a ghastly horror that in heap 
his proud foe fly and he that station keep 
so Pompey cool spirit put to all their heat 
by Caesar hard pursuit he turn fresh head 
and fly upon his foe with such a rapture 
as take up into fury all friend fear 
who fire with his first turn all turn head 
and give so fierce a charge their follower flee 
who instant issue on their both side see 
and after set out such a tragedy 
as all the prince of the earth may come 
to take their pattern by the spirit of Rome 

stay cowherd fly you Caesar fortune 

forbear foolish Crassinius we contend in vain 
to stay these vapour and must raise our camp 

how shall we rise my lord but all in uproar 
be still pursue 
the pursuit stay my lord 
Pompey have sound a retreat resign 
his time to you to use in instant raise 
your illlodged army pitch now where fortune 
may good amends make for her fault today 

it be not fortune fault but my Acilius 
to give my foe charge be so near the sea 
where well I know the eminence of his strength 
and shall have drive the encounter further off 
bear before i such a goodly country 
so plentiful and rich in all thing fit 
to have supply my army want with victual 
and the able city too to strengthen it 
of Macedon and Thessaly where now 
I rather be besiege for want of food 
then do assault with fight force of arm 

see sir here be one friend of your foe recover 

Vibius in happy hour 

for i unhappy 

what bring against your will 

else have not come 

sir he be your prisoner but have make you his 
have all the rest pursue the chase like he 
he drive on like a fury past all friend 
but we that take he quick in his engagement 

o Vibius you deserve to pay a ransom 
of infinite rate for have your general join 
in your addression or know how to conquer 
this day have prove he the supreme of Caesar 

know how to conquer his five hundred conquest 
achieve ere this day make that doubt unfit 
for he that fly he for of issue doubtful 
who can at all time put on for the best 
if I be mad must he his army venture 
in my engagement nor be general ever 
their power disposer by their proper angel 
but trust against they oftentimes their counsel 
wherein I doubt not Caesar self have err 
sometime as well as Pompey 

or do worse 
in disobey my counsel Vibius 
of which this day abuse light be witness 
by which I may have see a course secure 
of this discomfiture 

amends sit ever 
above repentance what be do wish not undo 
but that prepare patience that you know 
best fit a soldier charge with hard fortune 
ask still your use since power still temperate keep 
open still the clear eye by one fault sight 
to place the next act in the sure right 

you prompt i noble sir repair in i 
my own stay practice out of who repose 
the strong convulsion of my spirit force i 
thus far beyond my temper but good Vibius 
be ransom with my love and haste to Pompey 
entreat he from i that we may meet 
and for that reason which I know this day 
be give by Cato for his pursuit stay 
which be prevention of our roman blood 
propose my offer of our hearty peace 
that be reconcile and mutual faith 
give on our either part not three day light 
may further show we foe but both our army 
disperse in garrison we may return 
within that time to Italy such friend 
as in our country love contain our spleen 

it be offer sir above the rate of Caesar 
in other man but in what I approve 
beneath his merit which I will not fail 
to enforce at full to Pompey nor forget 
in any time the gratitude of my service Vi salute Ant and the other and exit 

your love sir and your friendship 

This prepare a good induction to the change of fortune 
in this day issue if the pride it kindle 
in Pompey vein make he deny a peace 
so gentle offer for she alter hand 
work never sure from her ill to good 
on his side she have hurt and on the other 
with other change then when mean be use 
to keep her constant yet retire refuse 

I try no such conclusion but desire 
direct peace in mean space I will prepare 
for other issue in my utmost mean 
who hope now rest at Brundisium 
in that part of my army with Sabinus 
I wonder he so long delay to bring i 
and must in person haste he if this even 
I hear not from he 

that I hope fly far 
your full intent my lord since Pompey navy 
you know lie hover all alongst those sea 
in too much danger for what aid soever 
you can procure to pass your person safe 

which doubt may prove the cause that stay Sabinus 
and if with ship fit to pass your army 
he yet strain time to venture I presume 
you will not pass your person with such convoy 
of those poor vessel as may serve you here 

how shall I help it shall I suffer this 
torment of his delay and rack suspicion 
worse than assure destruction through my thought 

past doubt he will be here I leave all order 
and full agreement make with he to make 
all utmost haste not least let once suspect 

suspect what suspection shall fear a friend 
in such assure straits from his friend enlargement 
if it be his soldier safety he so tender 
be it not better they shall sink by sea 
then wrack their number king and cause ashore 
their stay be worth their ruin shall we live 
if they in fault be if their leader he 
sell die the death of all in mean space I 
that shall not bear all fly the sight in shame 
thou eye of nature and abortive night 
fall dead among we with defect defect 
must serve proportion justice never can 
be else restore nor right the wrong of man exeunt 

this charge of our fierce foe the friendly god 
have in our stregthen spirit beat back 
with happy issue and his force lessen 
of two and thirty ensign force from he 
two thousand soldier slay 

o boast not that 
their loss be you my lord 

I boast it not 
but only name the number 

which right well 
you may have raise so high that on their top 
your throne be offer ever to overlook 
subvert Caesar have you be so bless 
to give such honour to your captain counsel 
as their alacrity do long to merit 
with proofful action 

o it be ill neglect 

it be defer with reason which not yet 
the event so clear be to confute 

if it be 
our likely than be not to hazard battle 
the adventure be so casual if compare 
with our more certain mean to his subversion 
for find now our army ample store 
with all thing fit to tarry sure time 
reason think better to extend to length 
the war betwixt we that his little strength 
may by degree prove none which urge now 
consist of his best and able soldier 
we shall have find at one direct set battle 
of matchless valour their defect of victual 
not tire yet enough on their tough nerve 
where on the other part to put they still 
in motion and remotion here and there 
enforce they to fortify still 
wherever they set down to siege a wall 
keep watch all night in armour their most part 
can never bear it by their year oppression 
spend heretofore too much in those steel toil 

I so advise and yet repent it not 
but much rejoice in so much save blood 
as have be pour out in the stroke of battle 
who fury thus prevent comprehend 
your country good and empire in who care 
let i beseech you that in all this war 
you sack no city subject to our rule 
nor put to sword one citizen of Rome 
but when the needful fury of the sword 
can make no fit distinction in main battle 
that you will please still to prolong the stroke 
of absolute decision to these jar 
consider you shall strike it with a man 
of much skill and experience and one 
that will his conquest sell at infinite rate 
if that must end your difference but I doubt 
there will come humble offer on his part 
of honour peace to you for who sweet name 
so cry out to you in our latemet senate 
lose no fit offer of that wish treaty 
take pity on your country blood as much 
as possible may stand without the danger 
of hinder her justice on her foe 
which all the god to your full wish dispose 

why will you leave we whither will you go

I be command by our powerful senate 
to view the city and the kingdom situate 
about your either army that which side

may curb and order in these neighbour confine 
my chief pass yet resolve for Utica

may all good power make safe and always answer 
your infinite merit with their like protection 
in which I make no doubt but we shall meet

to serve who in the sacred roman safety 
myself Iberia king present my force 

and I that hold the tributary throne 
of grecian Thessaly submit my homage 
to Rome and Pompey 

so Cilicia too 

and so Epirus 

last I from Thrace 
present the duty of my power and service 

your royal aide deserve of Rome and Pompey 
our utmost honour o may now our fortune 
not balance her broad breast betwixt two light wing 
nor on a slippery globe sustain her step 
but as the spartan say the paphian queen 
the flood Eurotas pass lay aside 
her glass her ceston and her amorous grace 
and in Lycurgus favour arm her beauty 
with shield and javelin so may fortune now 
the flood of all our enemy force pass 
with her fair ensign and arrive as we 
displume her shoulder cast off her wing shoe 
her faithless and stillrolling stone spurn from she 
and enter our power as she may remain 
our firm assistant that the general aid 
favour and honour you perform to Rome 
may make she build with you her endless home 

the god vouchsafe it and our cause right 

what sudden shade be this observe my lord 
the night methinks come on before her hour 

nor trust i if my thought conceive not so 

what thin cloud fly the wind like swift shaft 
along air middle region 

they presage 
unusual tempest 

and it be their repair 
that timeless darken thus the gloomy air 

let we force no omen from it but avoid 
the vapour fury now by jove employ 
the wrathful tempest of the angry night 
where hell fly muffle up in cloud of pitch 
mingle with sulphur and those dreadful bolt 
the Cyclops ram in jove artillery 
have rouse the fury arm in all their horror 
up to the envious sea in spite of Caesar 
o night oh jealous night of all the noble 
beauty and glory where the god have strike 
their four digestion from thy ghastly chaos 
blush thus to drown they all in this hour sign 
by the necessity of fate for Caesar 
I that have ransack all the world for worth 
to form in man the image of the god 
must like they have the power to check the worst 
of all thing under their celestial empire 
stoop it and burst it or break through it all 
with use and safety till the crown be set 
on all my action that the hand of nature 
in all her worst work aim at a end 
may in a masterpiece of she be serve 
with top and state fit for his virtuous crown 
not lift art thus far up in glorious frame 
to let they vanish thus in smoke and shame 
this river Anius in who mouth now lie 
a pinnace I will pass in to fetch on 
my army dull rest from Brundisium 
that be at all time else exceed calm 
by reason of a purl wind that fly 
off from the shore each morning drive up 
the billow far to sea in this night yet 
bear such a terrible gale put off from sea 
as beat the land wind back and thrust the flood 
up in such uproar that no boat dare stir 
and on it be disperse all Pompey navy 
to make my peril yet more envious 
shall I yet shrink for all be all yet more 
there be a certain need that I must give 
way to my pass none know that I must live 

what battle be there seek now in the air 
that threat the wrack of nature 

master come 
shall we thrust through it all 

what lose man 
be thou in hope and fortune that dare make 
so desperate a motion 

Launch man and all thy fear freight disavow 
thou carry Caesar and his fortune now 

we too well love Pompey 
to do he that injustice 

who more thirst 
the conquest then resolve to bear the foil 

say brutuslike give several witness all 
that you acquit i whatsoever fall 

particular man particular fate must bear 
who feel his own wound less to wound another 

leave he the worst who best be left undo 
he only conquer who mind still be one 

free mind like dice fall square whatever the cast 

who on himself sole stand stand sole fast 

he be never down who mind fight still aloft 

who care for up or down when all be but thought 

to thing event do not man power extend 

since god rule all who any thing will mend 

you sweet ease my charge yourselves unburden 
return not yet our trumpet send to know 
of Vibius certain state 

not yet my lord 

too long protract we all mean to recover 
his person quick or dead for I still think 
his loss serve fate before we blow retreat 
though some affirm he see soon after fight 

not after sir I hear but ere it end 

he bear a great mind to extend our pursuit 
much further than it be and serve that day 
when you have like the true head of a battle 
lead all the body in that glorious turn 
upon a faroff squadron that stand fast 
in conduct of the great Marc Anthony 
when all the rest be flee so past a man 
that in their tough receipt of he I see he 
thrice break through all with ease and pass as fair 
as he have all be fire and they but air 

he stick at last yet in their midst it seem 

so have I see a fire drake glide at midnight 
before a die man to point his grave 
and in it stick and hide 

he come yet safe 

o Vibius welcome what a prisoner 
with mighty Caesar and so quick ransom 

I sir my ransom need little time 
either to gain agreement for the value 
or the disbursement since in Caesar grace 
we both conclude 

be his grace so free 

for your respect sir 

nay sir for his glory 
that the main conquest he so sure build on 
which ever be forerun with petty fortune 
take not effect by take any friend 
from all the most my poor defence can make 
but must be complete by his perfect own 

I know sir you more noble rate the freedom 
he free give your friend then to pervert it 
so past his wisdom that know much too well 
the uncertain state of conquest to raise frame 
of such presumption on her fickle wing 
and chief in a loss so late and grievous 
beside your force far exceed he 
his whole power be but two and twenty thousand 
and you full four and forty thousand strong 
for all which yet he stand as far from fear 
in my enlargement as the confident glory 
you please to put on he and have this end 
in my so kind dismission that as kind 
I may solicit a sure peace betwixt you 

a peace be it possible 

Come do not show this wanton incredulity too much 

believe i I be far from such a thought 
in his high stomach Cato prophesy then 
what think my lord our consul and friend Brutus 

a offer happy 

be it plain and hearty 

ay there be the true inspection to his prospect 

This straight of he perhaps may need a sleight 
oh some hide stratagem to bring he off 

device of a new forge to entrap i 
I rest in Caesar shade walk his strew path 
sleep in his quiet wave I will soon trust 
hibernian bog and quicksand and hell mouth 
take for my sanctuary in bad part 
that no extreme will better nature finger 
have mark he to i to take heed of he 
what think my Brutus 

it be your best and safe 

This offer peace of he be sure a snare 
to make our war the bloody who fit fear 
make i I dare not now in thought mature 
then late incline i put in use the counsel 
your noble father Cato part give i 
who much too tender shun innocent blood 
this battle hazard now that must cost more 

it do and therefore now no more defer it 

say all man so 

we do 

I grieve you do 
because I rather wish to err with Cato 
then with the truth go of the world beside 
but since it shall abide this other stroke 
you god that our great roman genius 
have make not give we one day conquest only 
nor grow in conquest for some little time 
as do the genius of the Macedon 
nor be by land great only like laconian 
nor yet by sea alone as be the Athenian 
nor slow stir up like the persian angel 
nor rock asleep soon like the ionian spirit 
but make our roman genius fiery watchful 
and even from Rome prime join his youth with she 
grow as she grow and firm as earth abide 
by her increase pomp at sea and shore 
in peace in battle against Greece as well 
as our barbarian foe command yet further 
you firm and just god our assistful angel 
for Rome and Pompey who now fight for Rome 
that all these royal law to we and justice 
of common safety may the selflove drown 
of tyrannous Caesar and my care for all 
your altar crown with endless festival exeunt 

Say sacred soothsayer and inform the truth 
what like have thou of our sacrifice 

imperial Caesar at your sacred charge 
I draw a milk white ox into the temple 
and turn there his face into the east 
fearful shake at the shine light 
down fall his horn forehead to his hoof 
when I begin to greet he with the stroke 
that shall prepare he for the holy rite 
with hideous roar he lay out such a throat 
as make the secret lurk of the god 
to answer echolike in threaten sound 
I strike again at he and then he sleep 
his lifeblood boil out at every wound 
in stream as clear as any liquid ruby 
and there begin to alter my presage 
the other ill sign show the other fortune 
of your last skirmish which far opposite now 
prove ill beginning good event foreshow 
for now the beast cut up and lay on the altar 
his limb be all lick up with instant flame 
not like the elemental fire that burn 
in household use lame struggle up 
this way and that way wind as it rise 
but right and upright reach his proper sphere 
where burn the fire eternal and sincere 

and what may that presage 

that even the spirit 
of heaven pure flame fly down and ravish up 
your offering blaze in that religious instant 
which show the alacrity and cheerful virtue 
of heaven free bounty do good in time 
and with what swiftness true devotion climb 

the god be honour 

o behold with wonder 
the sacred blaze be like a torch enlighten 
direct burn just above your camp 

miraculous 

believe it with all thank 
the roman genius be alter now 
and arm for Caesar 

soothsayer be for ever 
reverence of Caesar o Marc Anthony 
I think to raise my camp and all my tent 
take down for swift remotion to Scotussa 
shall now our purpose hold 

against the god 
they grace in the instant and in the instant we 
must add our part and be in the use as free 

see sir the scout return enter two scout

a strange confusion in your enemy camp 
the soldier take arm in all dismay 
and hurl they again as fast to earth 
every way rout as the alarm be then 
give to their army a most causeless fear 
disperse quite through they 

then it be jove himself 
that with his secret finger stir in they 

other presage of success my lord 
have strange happen in the adjacent city 
to this your army for in Tralleis 
within a temple build to victory 
there stand a statue of your form and name 
near who firm base even from the marble pavement 
there spring a palm tree up in this last night 
that seem to crown your statue with his bough 
spread in wrap shadow round about your brow 

the sign Crassinius be most strange and graceful 
nor can get issue but by power divine 
yet will not that nor all abode beside 
of never such kind promise of success 
perform it without tough act of our own 
no care no nerve the less to be employ 
no offer to the god no vow no prayer 
secure and idle spirit never thrive 
when most the god for their advancement strive 
and therefore tell i what abode thou build on 
in a spirit to act inflame in thou

my father Scipio shall lead the battle 
Domitius the left wing I the right 
against Marc Anthony take now your fils 
you beastly doter on your barbarous will exeunt 

fly fly the day be lose before it be fight 

the roman fear their shadow 

be there ever 
such monstrous confidence as last night 
their cup and music show before the morning 
make such amaze ere one stroke be strike 

it make great Pompey mad which who can mend 
the god have hand in it 

it make the consul 
run on their sword to see it the brave patrician 
flee with their spoil face arrow stick 
as shot from heaven at they 

it be the charge 
that Caesar give against they 

Come away 
leave all and wonder at this fatal day exeunt 

pursue pursue the god foreshow their power 
which we give issue and the day be we 
crassineus o look up he do and show 
death in his break eye which Caesar hand 
shall do the honour of eternal closure 
too well thou keep thy word that thou this day 
will do i service to our victory 
which in thy life or death I shall behold 
and praise thou for I do and must admire 
thy matchless valour ever ever rest 
thy manly lineament which in a tomb 
erect to thy noble name and virtue 
I will curious preserve with balm and spice 
in eminent place of these pharsalian field 
inscribe with this true soul of funeral 
crassineus fight for fame and die for Rome 
who public weal spring from this private tomb 

thus have the god their justice man their will 
and I by man will rule myself renounce 
be by my angel and the god abhor 
who draw i like a vapour up to heaven 
to dash i like a tempest against the earth 
oh the deserve terror that attend 
on humane confidence have ever man 
such outrage of presumption to be victor 
before they arm to send to Rome before 
for house near the market place their tent 
strew all with flower and nosegay table cover 
with cup and banquet bay and myrtle garland 
as ready to do sacrifice for conquest 
rather than arm they for fit fight to enforce it 
which when I see I know as well the event 
as now I feel it and because I rage 
in that presage my genius show i clear 
as in a mirror all this curse issue 
and therefore urge all mean to put it off 
for this day or from these field to some other 
or from this ominous confidence till I see 
their spirit settle in some grave knowledge 
of what belong to such a dear decision 
they spot i with fear with love of glory 
to keep in my command so many king 
so great a army all the hellish blast 
that can be breathe on i to strike i blind 
of honour spirit and soul and shall I then 
save they that will in spite of heaven be rvinde 
And in their safety ruin i and i 
in everlasting rage of their detraction 

your safety and own honour do deserve 
respect past all their value oh my lord 
will you 

upbray i not go to go on 

no I will not rub the wound the misery be 
the god for any error in a man 
which they may rectify and shall because 
that man maintain the right shall suffer wrong 
to be thus insolent thus grace thus bless 

o the strange carriage of their act by which 
man order they and their devotion in they 
much rather strive to entangle man 
in pathless error then with regular right 
confirm their reason and their piety light 
for now sir whatsoever be foreshow 
by heaven or prodigy ten part more for we 
forewarn we deter we and all 
our blind and brainless frenzy then for Caesar 
all yet will be ascribe to his regard 
give by the god for his good part prefer 
their gloss be stark imposture to the justice 
love honour piety of our law and country 
though I think these be argument enough 
for my acquittal that for all these fight 

you be clear my lord 

god help i as I be 
whatever my untouched command of million 
through all my eight and fifty year have win 
this one day in the world esteem have lose 
so vile be praise and dispraise by event 
for I be still myself in every worth 
the world can grace i with have this day even 
in one blaze join with all my other conquest 
and shall my comfort in my wellknown self 
fail i for their false fire Demetrius 

o no my lord 

take grief for they as if 
the rottenhearted world can steep my soul 
in filthy putrefaction of their own 
since their applause fail i that be hiss 
to every sound acceptance I confess 
that till the affair be past my passion flame 
but now it be helpless and no cause in i 
rest in these ember my unmoved soul 
with any outward change this distich mind 
no man shall more allow his own loss woe 
be past his fault then any stranger do 
and for the world false love and airy honour 
what soul that ever love they most in life 
once sever from this breathe sepulchre 
again come and appear in any kind 
their kind admirer still or do the state 
of any best man here associate 
and every true soul shall be here so sever 
from love of such man as here drown their soul 
as all the world do Cato sole accept 
to who I will fly now and my wife in way 
poor lady and poor child worse than fatherless 
visit and comfort Come Demetrius they disguise themselves 
we now must suit our habit to our fortune 
and since these change ever chance to great 
nor desire to be 
do fortune to exceed it what she can 
a Pompey or a Caesar but a man exeunt 

o we have slay not conquer Roman blood 
pervert the event and desperate blood let out 
with their own sword do ever man before 
envy their own life since another live 
who they will wilful conceive their foe 
and forge a tyrant mere in their fear 
to justify their slaughter consul fury 

be sir their fault their grief the great number 
be only slave that leave their blood to ruth 
and altogether but six thousand slay 

however many god and man can witness 
themselves enforce it much against the most 
I can enforce on Pompey for our peace 
of all slay yet if Brutus only live 
I shall be comfort for his life save 
will weigh the whole six thousand that be lose 
but much I fear his death because the battle 
full strike now he yet abide unfound 

I see he fight near the battle end 
but sudden give off as bend to fly 

he come here see sir 

I submit to Caesar 
my life and fortune 

a more welcome fortune 
be Brutus than my conquest 

sir I fight 
against your conquest and yourself and merit 
I must acknowledge a much stern welcome 

you fight with i sir for I know your arm 
be take for your country not for Pompey 
and for my country I fight nothing less 
than he or both the mightystomached consul 
both who I hear have slay themselves before 
they will enjoy life in the good of Caesar 
but I be nothing worse how ill soever 
they and the great authority of Rome 
will fain enforce i by their mere suspicion 
love they their country better than her Brutus 
or know what fit noblesse and a roman 
with free soul than Brutus those that live 
shall see in Caesar justice and whatever 
may make i worthy both their life and love 
that I have lose the one without my merit 
and they the other with no roman spirit 
be you impair to live and joy my love 
only requite i Brutus love but Caesar 
and be in all the power of Caesar Caesar 
in which free wish I join your father Cato 
for who I will haste to Utica and pray 
his love may strengthen my success today exeunt 

to what use take you that my lord 

take you 
no note that I take it nor let any servant 
beside yourself of all my father near 
serve any mood he serve with any knowledge 
of this or any other Caesar come 
and give his army wing to reach this town 
not for the town sake but to save my father 
who just he suspect to be resolve 
of any violence to his life before 
he will preserve it by a tyrant favour 
for Pompey have miscarry and be flee 
be true to i and to my father life 
and do not tell he nor his fury serve 
with any other 

I will die my lord 
ere I observe it 

o my lord and father 

what fear fly here on all side what wild look 
be squint at i from man mere suspicion 
that I be wild myself and will enforce 
what will be take from i by the tyrant 

no will you only ask life he will think 
his own life give more strength in give your 

I ask my life of he 

ask what be he own 
of he he scorn shall have the least drop in it 
at his disposure 

no Statilius 
Men that have forfeit life by break law 
or have be overcome may beg their life 
but I have ever be in every justice 
better than Caesar and be never conquer 
or make to fly for life as Caesar be 
but have be victor ever to my wish 
against whosoever ever have oppose 
where Caesar now be conquer in his conquest 
in the ambition he till now deny 
take upon he to give life when death 
be tenfold due to his most tyrannous self 
no right no power give he to raise a army 
which in despite of Rome he lead about 
slaughter her loyal subject like a outlaw 
nor be he better tongue show falsehood be 
to bloody death his part so much admire 
vainglory villainy and at best you can 
feed with the pare of a worthy man 
my fame affirm my life receive from he 
I will rather make a beast my second father 

the god avert from every roman mind 
the name of slave to any tyrant power 
why be man ever just but to be free 
against all injustice and to bear about he 
as well all mean to freedom every hour 
as every hour he shall be arm for death 
which only be his freedom 

but Statilius 
death be not free for any man election 
till nature or the law impose it on he 

must a man go to law then when he may 
enjoy his own in peace if I can use 
my own myself must I of force reserve it 
to serve a tyrant with it all just man 
not only may enlarge their life but must 
from all rule tyrannous or live unjust 

by death must they enlarge their life 

by death 

a man be not bind to that 

I will prove he be 
be not the life of all man bind to justice 

they be 

and therefore not to serve injustice 
justice itself ought ever to be free 
and therefore every just man be a part 
of that free justice shall be free as it 

then wherefore be there law for death 

that all 
that know not what law be nor free can 
perform the fit justice of a man 
in kingdom common good may be force 
but be not every just man to himself 
the perfect law 

suppose 

then to himself 
be every just man life subordinate 
again sir be not our free soul infuse 
to everybody in her absolute end 
to rule that body in which absolute rule 
be she not absolute empress of it 
And be empress may she not dispose 
it and the life in it at her just pleasure 

not to destroy it 

no she not destroy it 
when she dislive it that their freedom may 
go firm together like their power and organ 
rather than let it live a rebel to she 
profane that divine conjunction 
betwixt she and it nay a disjunction make 
betwixt they worse than death in kill quick 
that which in just death live be dead to she 
if to her rule dead and to her alive 
if die in her just rule 

the body live not 
when death have rest it 

yet it be free and keep 
fit for rejunction in man second life 
which die rebel to the soul be far 
unfit to join with she in perfect life 

it shall not join with she again 

it shall 

in reason shall it 

in apparent reason 
which I will prove clear 

hear and judge it sir 

as nature work in all thing to a end 
so in the appropriate honour of that end 
all thing precedent have their natural frame 
and therefore be there a proportion 
betwixt the end of those thing and their prime 
for else there can not be in their creation 
always or for the most part that firm form 
in their still like existence that we see 
in each full creature what proportion then 
have a immortal with a mortal substance 
and therefore the mortality to which 
a man be subject rather be asleep 
then bestial death since sleep and death be call 
the twin of nature for if absolute death 
and bestial seize the body of a man 
then be there no proportion in his part 
his soul be free from death which otherwise 
retain divine proportion for as sleep 
no disproportion hold with humane soul 
but apt quicken the proportion 
betwixt they and body make body fit 
to give up form to soul which be their end 
so death twinborn of sleep resolve all 
man body heavy part in light nature 
make a reunion with the sprightly soul 
when in a second life their being give 
hold their proportion firm in high heaven 

hold you our body shall revive resume 
our soul again to heaven 

past doubt though other 
think heaven a world too high for our low reach 
not know the sacred sense of he that sing 
jove can let down a golden chain from heaven 
which tie to earth shall fetch up earth and sea 
and what be that golden chain but our pure soul 
a golden beam of he let down by he 
that govern with his grace and draw by he 
can hoist this earthy body up to he 
the sea and air and all the element 
compress in it not while it be thus concrete 
but fine by death and then give heavenly heat 

your happy exposition of that place 
who sacred depth I never hear so sound 
evict glad grant from I you hold a truth 

be it not a manly truth and mere divine 

it be a good cheerful doctrine for good man 
but son and servant this be only argue 
to spend our dear time well and no life urge 
to any violence further than his owner 
and grave man hold fit let we talk of Caesar 
he be the great subject of all talk and he 
be hot haste on be supper ready 

it be my lord 

why then let we in and eat 
our cool submission will quench Caesar heat 

submission here be for he 

statilus 
my reason must not strengthen you in error 
nor learn Athenodorus gentle yield 
talk with some other deep philosopher 
or some divine priest of the know god 
and hear their reason in mean time come sup exeunt 

so may my comfort for this good news thrive 
as I be thankful for they to the god 
joy unexpected and in desperate plight 
be still most sweet and prove from whence they come 
when earth still moonlike confidence in joy 
be at her full true joy descend far 
from past her sphere and from that high heaven 
that move and be not move how far be I 
from hope of these event when fearful dream 
of harpy tear out my heart of army 
terrible join city kingdom fall 
and all on i prove sleep not twin to death 
but to i death itself yet make then 
these letter full of as much cheerful life 
I find close in my hand o god how just 
you laugh at all thing earthly at all fear 
that rise not from your judgement at all joy 
not draw direct from yourselves and in you 
distrust in man be faith trust in he ruin 
why write great learned man man mere rapt 
with sacred rage of confidence belief 
undaunted spirit inexorable fate 
and all fear tread on it be all but air 
if any comfort be it be in despair 

you learned lady may hold any thing 

now madam be your walk from coach come near 
the promontory where you late command 
a sentinel shall stand to see from thence 
if either with a navy bring by sea 
or train by land great Pompey come to greet you 
as in your letter he near this time promise 

o may this isle of Lesbos compass in 
with the aegaean sea that do divide 
Europe from Asia the sweet literate world 
from the barbarian from my barbarous dream 
divide my dear husband and his fortune 

he be busy now with order office 
by this time madam sit your honour father he look in his letter 
in Caesar chair of universal bishop 
Domitius Ahenobarbas be make consul 
Spinther his consort and Phaonius 
tribune or praetor 

these be only seek 
before the battle not obtain nor move 
my father but in shadow 

why shall man 
tempt fate with such firm confidence seek place 
before the power that shall dispose can grant they 
for then the stroke of battle be not strike 

nay that be sure enough physician know 
when sick man eye be break they must die 
your letter tell you his victory 
lose in the skirmish which I know have break 
both the eye and heart of Caesar for as man 
healthful through all their life to greyhaired age 
when sickness take they once they seldom escape 
so Caesar victor in his general fight 
till this late skirmish can no adverse blow 
sustain without his utter overthrow 

see madam now your sentinel inquire 

see thou no fleet yet sentinel nor train 
that may be think great Pompey 

not yet madam 

see thou no traveller address this way 
in any number on this Lesbian shore 

I see some not worth note a couple come 
this way on foot that be not now far hence 

come they apace like messenger with news 

no nothing like my lord nor be their habit 
of any such man fashion be long mantle 
and sable hew their head all hide in hat 
of parch Thessaly broad brim high crown 

these serve not our hope 

now I see a ship 
a ken hence that strike into the haven 

one only ship 

one only madam yet 

that shall not be my lord 

your lord no madam 

she now let out arm man upon the land 

arm man with drum and colour 

no my lord 
but bright in arm yet bear half pike or beadhook 

these can be no plume in the train of Pompey 

I will see he in his letter once again 

now madam come the two I see on foot 

see your princess sir come thus far from the 
city in her coach to encounter your promise come 
about this time in your last letter 

the world be alter since Demetrius offer to go by 

see madam two thessalian augur it seem 
by their habit call and inquire if either by their 
skill or travel they know no news of your husband 

my friend a word 

with we madam 

yes be you of Thessaly 

ay madam and all the world beside 

your country be great 

and our portion little 

be you augur 

augur madam yes a kind of augur alias 
wizard that go up and down the world teach 
how to turn ill to good 

can you do that 

ay madam you have no work for we have you 
no ill to turn good I mean 

yes the absence of my husband 

what be he 

Pompey the great 

wherein be he great 

in his command of the world 

then he be great in other take he without his 
addition great what be he then 

Pompey 

not your husband then 

Nothing the less for his greatness 

not in his right but in your comfort he be 

his right be my comfort 

what be his wrong 

my sorrow 

and that be ill 

yes 

you be come to the use of our profession madam 
will you have that ill turn good that 
sorrow turn comfort 

why be my lord wrong 

we profess not that knowledge madam 
suppose he be 

not I 

you will suppose he good 

he be so 

then must you needs suppose he wrong for 
all goodness be wrong in this world 

what call you wrong 

ill fortune affliction 

think you my lord afflict 

if I think he good madam I must unless he 
be worldly good and then either he be ill or have ill 
since as no sugar be without poison so be no worldly 
good without ill Even natural nourish in it like a 
household thief which be the worst of all thief 

then he be not worldly but true good 

he be too great to be true good for worldly greatness 
be the chief worldly goodness and all worldly goodness 
I prove before have ill in it which true good have not 

if he rule well with his greatness wherein be he ill 

but great ruler be like carpenter that wear their 
rule at their back still and therefore to make good your 
true good in he you have better suppose he little or mean 
for in the mean only be the true good 

but every great lady must have her husband 
great still or her love will be little 

I be none of those great lady 

she be a philosophress augur and can turn 
ill to good as well as you 

I will then not honour but adore she can you 
submit yourself cheerful to your husband 
suppose he fall 

if he submit himself cheerful to his fortune 

it be the great greatness in the world you undertake 

I will be so great if he be 

in supposition 

in fact 

be no woman but a goddess then and make good thy greatness 
I be cheerful fall be cheerful 

I be and welcome as the world be close 
in these embrace 

be it possible 
a woman lose greatness still as good 
as at her great o god be I ever 
great till this minute 

Len Pompey 

view i better 

Len conquer by Caesar 

not I but my army 
no fault in i in it no conquest of i 
I tread this low earth as I tread on Caesar 
must I not hold myself though lose the world 
nor lose I less a world lose at one clap 
it be more than jove ever thunder with 
what glory be it to have my hand hurl 
so vast a volley through the groan air 
and be it not great to turn grief thus to joy 
that break the heart of other 

Len oh it be jovelike 

it be to imitate jove that from the wound 
of soft cloud beat up the terrible sound 
I now be good for good man still have least 
that betwixt themselves and God may rise their rest 

o Pompey Pompey never great till now 

o my Cornelia let we still be good 
and we shall still be great and great far 
in every solid grace then when the tumour 
and boil of rot observation swell we 
grief for want outward be without our cure 
greatness not of itself be never sure 
before we go upon heaven rather tread 
the virtue of it underfoot in make 
the vicious world our heaven then walk there 
even here as know that our home contemn 
all forge heaven here raise set hill on hill 
Vulcan from heaven fall yet on his foot do light 
and stand no less a god then at his height 
at low thing lie fast we now be like 
the two pole prop heaven on which heaven move 
and they be fix and quiet be above 
all motion far we rest above the heaven 

o I more joy to embrace my lord thus fix 
than he have bring i ten inconstant conquest 

miraculous stand in a fall so great 
will Caesar know sir how you conquer he 
in your conviction 

it be enough for i 
that Pompey know it I will stand no more 
on other leg nor build one joy without i 
if ever I be worth a house again 
I will build all inward not a light shall open 
the common outway no expense no art 
no ornament no door will I use there 
but raise all plain and rude like a rampire 
against the false society of man 
that still batter 
all reason piecemeal and for earthy greatness 
all heavenly comfort ratify to air 
I will therefore live in dark and all my light 
like ancient temple let in at my top 
this be to turn one back to all the world 
and only look at heaven Empedocles 
recure a mortal plague through all his country 
with stop up the yawn of a hill 
from whence the hollow and unwholesome south 
exhale his venomed vapour and what else 
be any king give over to his lust 
but even the poison cleave of that crack mountain 
that all his kingdom plague with his example 
which I have stop now and so cure my country 
of such a sensual pestilence 
when therefore our disease affection 
harmful to humane freedom and stormlike 
infer darkness to the infect mind 
oppress our comfort it be but let in 
the light of reason and a pure spirit 
take in another way like room that fight 
with window against the wind yet let in sight

o beastly apprehender of thing manly 
and mere heavenly they with all the reason 
I use for just man liberty to bear 
their life and death up in their own free hand 
fear still my resolution though I seem 
to give it off like they and now be win 
to think my life in law rule not my own 
when once it come to death as if the law 
make for a sort of outlaw must bound i 
in their subjection as if I can 
be rack out of my vein to live in other 
as so I must if other rule my life 
and public power keep all the right of death 
as if man needs must serve the place of justice 
the form and idol and renounce itself 
ourselves and all our right in God and goodness 
our whole content and freedom to dispose 
all in the joy and way of arrant rogue 
no stay but their wild error to sustain we 
no forge but their throat to vent our breath 
to form our life in and repose our death 
see they have get my sword who be there 

my lord 

who take my sword hence dumb I do not ask 
for any use or care of it but hope 
I may be answer go sir let i have it Exit Mar 
poor slave how terrible this death be to they 
if man will sleep they will be wroth with all 
that interrupt they physic take to take 
the golden rest it bring both pay and pray 
for good and sound nap all friend consent 
in those kind invocation pray all 
good rest the god vouchsafe you put when death 
sleep natural brother come that be nothing worse 
but better be more rich and keep the store 
sleep ever fickle wayward still and poor 
oh how man grudge and shake and dear and fly 
his stern approach all their comfort take 
in faith and knowledge of the bliss and beauty 
that watch their wake in a endless life 
drown in the pain and horror of their sense 
sustain but for a hour be all the earth 
rapt with this error lie pursue my reason 
and hold that as my light and fiery pillar 
the eternal law of heaven and earth no firm 
but while I seek to conquer conquer Caesar 
my softspleened servant overrule and curb i 
where be he I send to fetch and place my sword 
where late I leave it dumb to Come another 
where be my sword hang here 

my lord I know not Ent Marcilius 

the rest come in there where be the sword I charge you 
to give his place again I will break your lip open 
spite of my freedom all my servant friend 
my son and all will needs betray i naked 
to the arm malice of a foe so fierce 
and bearlike mankind of the blood of virtue 
o god whoever see i thus contemn 
go call my son in tell he that the less 
he show himself my son the less I will care 
to live his father 

I beseech you sir 
rest patient of my duty and my love 
your other child think on our poor mother 
your family your country 

if the god 
give over all I will fly the world with they 
Athenodorus I admire the change 
I note in heavenly providence when Pompey 
do all thing out of course past right past reason 
he stand invincible against the world 
yet now his care grow pious and his power 
set all up for his country he be conquer 

the god will secret be nor must we measure 
their chastereserved deep by our dry shallows 
suffice we we be entire such 
as betwixt they and our conscience we know 
their grace in our virtue shall present 
unspotted with the earth to the high throne 
that overlook we for this giant world 
let we not contend with it when heaven itself 
fail to reform it why shall we affect 
the least hand over it in that ambition 
a heap it be of digest villainy 
virtue in labour with eternal chaos 
press to a live death and rack beneath it 
her throw unpitied every worthy man 
limb by limb saw out of her virgin womb 
to live here piecemeal torture fly life then 
your life and death make precedent for man Exit 

you hear my master what a life this be 
and use much reason to respect it so 
but i shall serve you yet restore my sword 
lest too much you presume and I conceive 
you front i like my fortune where be Statilius 

I think sir go with the three hundred roman 
in Lucius Caesar charge to serve the victor 

and will not take his leave of his poor friend 
then the philosopher have stoop his spirit 
which I admire in one so free and know 
and such a fiery hater of base life 
beside be such a vow and note foe 
to our great conqueror but I advise he 
to spare his youth and live 

my brother Brutus 
be go to Caesar 

Brutus of my honour 
although he be my son in law I must say 
there go as worthy and as learned a precedent 
as life in Rome whole rule for all life action 
and yet your sister Porcia his wife 
will scarce have do this but for you my son 
however Caesar deal with i be counsel 
by your experience father not to touch 
at any action of the public weal 
nor any rule bear near her politic stern 
for to be upright and sincere therein 
like Cato son the time corruption 
will never bear it and to soothe the time 
you shall do base and unworthy your life 
which to the god I wish may outweigh i 
in every virtue howsoever ill 
you thrive in honour 

ay my lord shall glad 
obey that counsel 

and what need you 
urge my kind care of any charge that nature 
impose on i have I ever show 
love least defect to you or any dues 
the most indulgent father be discreet 
can do his dear blood do you i right 
in judgement and in honour and dispense 
with passionate nature go neglect i not 
but send my sword in go it be I that charge you 

o my lord and father come advise i exeunt 

what have I now to think on in this world 
no one thought of the world I go each minute 
discharge of all care that may fit my freedom 
the next world and my soul then let i serve 
with her last utterance that my body may 
with sweetness of the passage drown the sour 
that death will mix with it the consul soul 
that slay themselves so noble scorn life 
lead under tyrant sceptre i will see 
for we shall know each other and past death 
retain those form of knowledge learn in life 
since if what here we learn we there shall lose 
or immortality be not life but time 
and that our soul in reason be immortal 
then natural and proper object prove 
which immortality and knowledge be 
for to that object ever be refer 
the nature of the soul in which the act 
of her high faculty be still employ 
and that true object must her power obtain 
to which they be in nature aim direct 
since it be absurd to have her sit a object 
which possible she never can aspire 

your sword my lord 

o be it find lay down 
upon the bed my boy Exit pa poor man a boy 
must be present manhood at no hand 
must serve so foul a fact for so be call 
in common mouth man fair act of all 
unsheathe be it sharp it be sweet now I be safe 
come Caesar quick now or lose your vassal 
now wing thou dear soul and receive her heaven 
the earth the air and sea I know and all 
the joy and horror of their peace and war 
and now will see the god state and the star 

Cato my lord 

I swear Statilius 
he be forth and go to seek you charge i 
to seek elsewhere lest you have slay yourself 
and by his love entreat you will live 

I swear by all the god I will run his fortune 

you may you may but shun the victor now 
who near be and will make we all his slave 

he shall himself be my first and my slave Exit 

look look in to my father oh I fear 
he be no sight for i to bear and live Exit 

o ruthful spectacle 

he have rip his entrail 

search search they may be sound 

they may and be 
give leave my lord that I may sew they up 
be yet unperished he thrust he back and pluck out his entrail 

stand off now they be not 
have he my curse that my life least part save 
just man be only free the rest be slave 

mirror of man 

the god envy his goodness 

too late too late with all our haste o Cato 
all my late conquest and my life whole act 
most crown most beautify be baste all 
with thy grave life expire in their scorn 
thy life be rule to all life and thy death 
thus forcible despise life the quench 
of all life glory 

unreclaimed man 
how censure Brutus his stern father fact 

it be not well do 

o censure not his act 
who know as well what fit man as all man 
all kneel your enemy head great Caesar 

curse monster 
wound not my eye with it nor in my camp 
let any dare to view it far as noblesse 
the den of barbarism fly and bliss 
the bitter curse of vex and tyrannize nature 
transfer it from i bear the plague of virtue 
how dare you poison thus my thought to torture 
they with instant rapture 

sacred Caesar 

away with they I vow by all my comfort 
who slack seem or not fiery in my charge 
shall suffer with they 

out base murderer 
torture torture for they bale they out 

cruel Caesar 

too mild with any torture 

let i crave 
the ease of my hate on their one curse life 

good Brutus take it oh you cool the poison 
these villain flame pour upon my spleen 
to suffer with my loathe if the blood 
of every common roman touch so near 
shall I confirm the false brand of my tyranny 
with be find a fautor of his murder 
who my dear country choose to fight for she 

your patience sir their torture well will quit you 

let my slave use sir be your precedent 

it shall I swear you do i infinite honour 
o Cato I envy thy death since thou 
envy my glory to preserve thy life 
why flee his son and friend Statilius 
so far I fly their hurt that all my good 
shall fly to their desire and for himself 
my lord and citizen of Utica 
his much renown of you quit with your most 
and by the sea upon some eminent rock 
erect his sumptuous tomb on which advance 
with all fit state his statue who right hand 
let hold his sword where may to all time rest 
his bone as honour as his soul be bless
