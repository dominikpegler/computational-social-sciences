sir I hope lord Lysicles be not yet retire 

no sir he command immediate notice 
shall be give of your come 

I fear my stay at the castle have make my 
duty seem unmannerly but till this minute I have not 
my dispatch from the governor 

let it not trouble you he never shut his eye 
till all this other world open they nor do he 
sleep then but with distract thought 
labour his fancy to present he object that may 
advance his grief 

what may the monstrous cause be 

it be monstrous indeed he lose his mistress 
barbarous murder by her perfidious uncle 
her urn be in Cirrha which my lord nightly 
visit and present it all his contract 
sigh of the flee day but at his part 
reassume more by think she be not to 
who dear memory his tear and grief be 
offer he be now alone and the religious awe 
which make our priest retire before they 
do adore the incense power be see in he 
who never dare approach her honour tomb 
till a just contemplation of his loss have 
make his sorrow eloquent 
see he come if when he part your haste will 
licence you I will relate the story of his 
unequalled suffering 

do you depart tonight 

this hour my lord 

I will not wrong you to entreat your care in sudden 
deliver these small packet but lest you 
shall believe they be mere ceremonious 
and so bear any date I now inform you 
I be concern in nothing near my grief except 

I wish your lordship happiness 

first wish i a captivity for as I be 
in the instant if heaven shall pour his blessing 
on i their quality will alter sir good night 

sir you be sad 

he have no heart to joy that can be otherwise 
that see this glorious youth groan under his harsh fate 

what a sad accent have each word he utter 

I can not mark they much but his whole 
frame be of such make as if despair have be the architect 
we may wish not hope a long life in he 

sir will you now take horse 

I shall have you not promise the original of 
this misfortune and trust i it be a bold 
curiosity that make i search into it for if 
the silent presentation have strike amazement 
in i how shall I guard my heart when sad 
disaster violence my passion 

thus then in short 
these noble kingdom Thessaly and Sparta 
have from the time two king command all 
under both title still be emulous 
and jealous of the advantage which each 
suspect may be in the adverse party 
this cause a last war but the fierce storm 
threaten not till the reign of these two king 
both crown young both of a equal age 
both have all the passion of their subject 
their fear except the ambassador 
that shall congratulate the new make king 
as if one spirit have inspire both 
come with this message little vary 
that each be joy in such a enemy 
no more the fearful wisdom of old man 
shall rust their sword that fate have give to one 
command of all in short their force meet 
and in ten bloody day none can decide 
which have the better cause 
the virtue of each prince so prevalent 
fortune be but spectator to conclude 
urgent affair at home compel each king 
to leave their army we commit he 
to STRIMON father of prince Lysicles 
the duke of Argos do command the spartana 
who swell with the great name of general 
before his king have hardly leave the sight 
of his great army draw his force out 
And face we in our trench it be not yet 
unquestioned whether fear or policy 
make STRIMON keep in his but certain this 
that virtue sharpen by necessity 
procure our triumph here Lysicles 
anticipate year unto his fame 
and on the wound of his brave enemy 
do write his story which our virgin sing 
but from this conquest do begin the cause of all his misery 

How from this unless the king shall judge 
it too dangerous a honour to be give to one 

he be lord of so much virtue 
he can fear it in a subject 

and as the common voice reach he in Athos 
there be none he look on with great 
demonstration of his love 

I know not that but this I be perfect in 
his judgement be direct by the king so powerful 
he can think his virtue injure 
though many shall be near in his grace 
it will inflict he strange if any shall be think 
to love his prince better than he 

pardon my interruption pray proceed 

the duke defeat post unto the court 
where he design unto his dire revenge 
the obscure path that ever time reveal 
since her first glass procure his king to throw 
neglect upon he and to seem in doubt 
of his oblige faith a severe search 
make on his paper his treasure value 
by the public officer and be himself 
twice deprehend in a seem flight 
calumniate libel and disgrace 
by his own seek and belief of other 
who judge he to be their honour ruin 
first raze his house and then demand his life 
as sacrifice unto their brother son 
nephew and public loss sedition 
have now the face of piety which once 
receive as just can hardly be repel 
the king with difficulty do assure his life 
with promise of his banishment 
this he foresee and seek and do disguise 
himself in fear of the incense people 
part in the night and partner of his fate 
have his fair niece who be so innocent 
she can think there be a great crime 
practise by man than error which do make 
they seem more vicious than in act we be 

I want a perspective for this dark mystery 
and but your knowledge do dissolve my doubt 
it will seem a riddle that a gentleman 
of his know valour reputation 
shall strive to lose both for some secret end 
I can yet arrive too 

sir you know 
revenge do master all our passion 
that be not servant to her rage 

but how unfriended banish the reproach 
of traitor fix upon he he can find 
the way unto it more easy I be ignorant 

this story will resolve you to this court he come 
be bring to the kingt then with a modest freedom 
relate his suffering hope that same have teach 
his story ere his come else he shall 
continue miserable as believe 
both by his friend and enemy a traitor 
deliver that he seek protection 
from he because none else can vindicate 
his innocence which many mother here 
say he have weep that day when fortune 
consult eat who shall be conqueror 
you brave lord say he that be present do my sword 
parley do you receive wound on condition 
be these by compact all my blood be lose 
since it be discredit what before be spend 
run in my name and make that live but now 
great king you only repeal my honour fall 
by give death unto your enemy 
our prince resent his fate confirm he his 
by a large pension and too soon entrust 
with all his secret give he mean to view 
his fort which he design and learn the strength 
of each particular province and inform 
of all make his escape and be receive 
of the spartana king with all remonstrance 
of love and confess service but before 
he part do that horrid act which 
Lysicles must die for 

Indeed this story do not much concern 
he if I mistake not 

at his arrival here he leave his niece 
with this design that when his plot be ripe 
without suspect he may come to the border 
hither he come and at his entrance be 
by a base traitorous servant certify 
of the great love betwixt she and Lysicles 
the compact of their vow with diverse letter 
the lover have exchange he storm and cry 
if thou do love young Lysicles my hate 
shall strike thou dead thy hand pluck back my honour 
when it be mount be constant and this hand 
shall by her death give thou a linger one 
and my revenge in thy own house begin 
then with a barbarous unheard of cruelty 
murder his niece and the same instant fly 
fame have the next sun blow this through the city 
his house be search the trunk of the dead lady 
find in the hall the head he carry with he 
in honour of his cruelty 

sure he be mad 

I will say so too but that I will not make 
he less guilty of this inhumanity 

what fury govern man we hazard all 
our life and fortune to gain hate memory 
and in the search of virtue tremble at shadow 
but how be you ascertain that he do 
this horrid act 

he send the bitter summons of her death 
by she that have betray she the report 
do make her spirit throng unto her heart 
and sure have kill it have not heaven decree 
his hand shall be as black as his intent 
she beg sometime for prayer and retire 
in her own blood do write her tragedy 
and part wish to her dear betroth 
now hear the strange mistake piety 
that ever enter in a virgin breast 
she so much love this barbarous homicide 
she will not have he guilty of her death 
and therefore with her own hand wound herself 
and as she bleed she write unto her lord 
at last conclude 
they will not let i make they innocent 
I be call unto my death and I repent 
my wound because I will not hurt 
that which I hope you love this bloody note 
be find the next day in her pocket 

And come it to the lord Lysicles 

it do and if you ever have see 
a hundred parent at one time deplore 
the unexpected death of their lose child 
the father sorrow and the mother tear 
will emblemise but not express his grief 
sometime he shriek as if he have send his soul 
out in his voice sometime stand fix and gaze 
as if he have no sense of what he see 
sometime he will sound and if the memory 
of his dear mistress even in the gate of death 
have not pursue he he have certain die 
torment do now give life at last he draw 
his sword and ere he can be stay do fall 
upon the point this I think do preserve he 
for not be mortal and he faint with 
the loss of blood have not then strength enough 
to end himself until he be persuade 
to live to celebrate her memory 
which nightly he do do upon her tomb 
whither he now be go 

I have not hear of such a love as this 

nor never shall of such a beauty as do cause it 
it be late and I will not trouble you with her story 
when you be at court all tongue will speak 
her merit to your wonder I will bring you to your horse 

and will you marry now 

Indeed will I 

and what shall be do with all those lock of hair 
you have 

why I will make button of they and have they half 
the value that I swear they have when I do beg they 
rich orient diamond can not equal they 
some come easy and some I be force to dig for in the mine 

and your prize liberty what shall become of that 
you swear you will not marry till there be 
a law establish that marry man 
may be redeem as slave be 

I be a ass when I talk so 
those damn book of chastity I read 
in my minority corrupt i but since 
I be practise in the world I find there be 
no great libertine than marry man 
it be true it be dangerous this knot in the 
first age when it be a crime to break vow 
but thanks to Venus the scene be alter 
and we act other part I will tell thou 
the privilege we enjoy when we be marry 
first our secrecy be hold authentic 
which be assurance will take up any woman at 
interest that be not peevish than the acquaintance 
which our wife bring we to who at time I carry 
my wife commendation and if their husband be 
not at home I do commend myself 

for what I prithee 

for a good dancer 
a good rider a good any thing 
that I think will please they 

thou will have a damnable conceit of thy wife 
by thy knowledge and opinion of all other 
woman unless you think she a phoenix 

it will be my best resolution but hark in thy 
ear rogue I can be content to think and 
wish i and all for the public good 
and wear my horn with as much confidence 
as the best velvet head of they all and paint 
they in my crest with this inscription 
these he deserve for his love to the commonwealth 

a rare fame you will purchase 

a more last one than any monument you can 
repeat the epitaph of and will it not be 
glorious to be commemorate as the first founder 
of the commonalty of undisparaged cuckold 

yes and pray for by bastard that get better 
father than they be destine to by their mother marriage 

And curse by surgeon that be undo by 
honest woman practice 

and this do voluntary which you will 
hardly avoid though you have a thousand 
guard to prevent it I that have be your 
playfellow shall be first suspect 
and first banish 

by Jupiter never no though it will preserve 
a thousand smooth forehead if she be honest 
your art can alter she and if otherwise 
have I not rather adopt a son of thou 
than a stranger and confess true Cleon 
will not you for this public benefit be 
content to sacrifice a sister that we may 
love no long by obligation but affection and 
see like and enjoy finish in a meeting 

unless I have mean to appropriate one you 
can suspect but I shall wish a title unto all 
but what hope have you of your mistress 

no airy one of like and affection but i 
be build on terrafirma already which her father 
look on greedy and proportion 
this to that grandchild to the second this 

be he not somewhat startle at the report of 
thy debauchery for though your thick set wood 
and spread vineyard make excellent shade 
to keep away the sun I mean the pierce eye 
of censure yet some suspicious common fame will raise 

indeed it be my enemy while my elder brother live 

but since his death you be alter I must 
confess it for then the slenderness of your 
annuity allow you but the election of some 
one sin I mean a cherish sin while 
the other repine that think themselves 
of equal dignity in time they have their turn 
yet single still but since your brother death 
you have show yourself a grateful 
gentleman and recompense those that have 
suffer for you to the full 

a pretty satire this to whip boy of nine 
yet still I tell thou I be another in the opinion of the world 

another Heliogabalus thou will be 
have thou his power but by what conjuration can 
you bring i to think it 

by reason which be a spirit will hardly be 
raise in you but thus it be while my brother 
live my wildness be observe by 

but now you walk in shade recluse and shut 
up in your coach your paint livery 
suppose Faries and she that you be wont to 
visit by the name of madam Ruffiana be now 
your aunt all this I be perfect in yet can 
reach the mystery of your suppose disguise 
you say do masque you 

hear i and be convert I say I be 
observe by those that be near in blood to i 
and with fear too lest the ruin of my 
fortune may force they to supply my want 
This cause the ague this the admonition and 
frequent counsel sometime severe reproof 
every one curl himself from any hope of i 
they will assist i and those give large counsel 
that will give nothing else 

of this I be yet a sad party and a witness too 

since my brother death the name of thing 
be change my riot be the bounty of my nature 
carelessness the freedom of my soul 
my prodigality a easiness of mind proportion 
to my fortune believe i Cleon this poverty 
be that which put a multiplyingglass upon our 
fault and make they swell and fill the eye 
our crime cry high then when they have bring we low 

I have not know any condemn for play 
but for lose 

true and let it be thy rule for all thing else 

it this be certain it will be long ere I be repute virtuous 

thou will never be unless it be this way 
I prophesy good Cleon 

it be a sad story pray let we leave it have you no rival 

none present that I can fear have her 
father firm consent 

Eugenio your rival still continue banish 

and I hope will till I be full possess of Hermione

nor know then any of offence or his pretence 
which his folly look I shall divine he meet i on the guard 
and draw upon i we have a little scuffle 
be part and he banish for the insolence 

prince Lysicles labour to recall he 

by all mean he be by in the noise battle see the 
prince cleave this man to the twist divide a second overthrow 
a three he be his trumpet 

his action need none 

will thou be happy Cleon believe not fame 
so far as to make thyself less than another man 
there be thousand that serve for six sesterce 
that do more than both yet sleep forget it be 
now time to meet the lady on the walk 

I do profane this place for be my grief 
as great as I will boast they I can not live 
to tell they to the world 
or be the passage which my soul shall make 
shut up with sorrow it be so and a joy 
a hopeful joy to meet she must give freedom 
to my sad prisoner when my hand shall lead 
this dagger to his heart that part we 
and heaven that hear this vow pour on my head 
dire thunder if I shrink in what I promise 
and sacred saint if from thy place of rest

of the curse homicide a full revenge 
of thy death and my life misery

Nothing madam 

then he do talk by sign he be long about it 
what be it Irene 

he long importune she to show her face which 
after many urge she consent to and he in 
recompense make a low reverence to she and 
then thank she for the great favour and 
conclude he never do receive so great a one 
from any woman since all else have do with they 
a reference to themselves but she be mere 
goodness for before he see she be may 
have suspect her face handsome hide for a 
piece of beauty if her virtue will have 
suffer he to be long in that error 

I will I be a man for his sake 

so you tell he and he still courteous for 
all your anger promise to give you what you

madam will you honour i and this gentleman 
with a sight of that which do enrich the world

So break the morning forth but the sun

for they descend even to our heart 

heaven defend my heart will tremble if they shall 

why madam

man and not be stick with horror it be impossible 

your wit do make you cruel but madam I

your finger write their epitaph express 
the mutual quiet they give man and receive 
from they or as all poison serve for some use 
give they your physician and let he 
apply they to his patient for a vomit 
this way they may be useful 

however you esteem they such a elegy 
will make you think your glass have not yet flatter you 

it can I prevent it and accuse it for 
not show the hill of snow the ruby 
and the rose they say have being from i 
but stay heaven open and I see a tempest come

that you shall hate a man for love you 
before he do profess himself your servant 
I know you do receive he with indifferency 
at least whence then proceed your hate 

from his expression of his love 

a cruel son spring from so mild a father if he do 
urge you to any thing may blast your honour 

she will not hear he and as it be how 
much do he oblige she he be now her servant 
and will entreat she to let he be her master

I know the priest that give it do you not blush 
be so young to know how to distinguish the difference 
of desire and this so wild that you will put off your 
obedience rather than lose one that you dare not say 
have interest in you but by my hope of rest 
I will use the power custom and nature give i 
to force you to your happiness 

how now my lord what miracle can raise a 
tempest here where so much beauty reign 

my lord you be not practise in the care of 
father I think to have see this gentleman 
my son tomorrow and she do not refuse he but 

it must not be pardon i virtue that I begin 
a act will set a stain upon my blush brow 
yet I must through lord Pindarus my 
fortune carry a pardon with they when 
they make i err in act of ceremonial 
decency they have be so heavy and so mighty 
they have bend i so low to the earth 
I can not cast my face upward to hope a blessing 
the cause you be perfect in 

it be a noble sorrow but your deep melancholy 
give it too large a growth 

thus all do press it yet have my grief relation 
only to myself I will not part they from 
my heart and memory they just do possess 
but my father have no more issue save myself 
for to confer his name and fortune on 

Oure Greece will mourn if such a glorious 
stock shall end in the most flourish branch 

if you do wish it a continuance it be in your 
power to make it last to age since my 
milesia death I have not love a lady equal 
with your Hermione in she I hope to lose 
my swell misfortune and find out a joy 
that may extinguish they it be now no time 
to tell she how much I be her servant for 
this lord here that do pretend to her fair 
grace before I have declare myself his 
rival perchance you will believe i if 
I have say he no way do deserve she 

where you pretend who can but heaven 
that design a blessing to my child it have 
be pride to hope for have make she still 
averse to his pretence but give she the 
liberty of refuse I know he be remove 

thus then tomorrow I will wait on yond 
lady I be your servant 

my lord ERGASTO you see with how much candour 
I have embrace your love yet though I do 
put on a father strictness in my daughter presence 
I can force she to a act whereon 
for ever will depend her happiness

my business call i get you home your servant 

ERGASTO my lord ERGASTO what have you leave 
your tongue with your heart

be not mar in the voyage but do you 
remember where you be to meet with Phormio 

nor any thing else her beauty make i forget 
all thing that have no reference to it 

Hey day if within these two hour if you do 
not forget the cause of this forgetfulness I will 
be a eunuch what if the prince shall be your 
rival I can tell but my lord Pindarus on a 
sudden fall from his anger to his daughter to a 
ceremony to you may be suspect

memory your remedy be certain there 
be more handsome face will recompense this loss

she speak our language 

her father be of Greece a wealthy merchant 
and his business enforce he to leave his 
country he marry a lady of that place where he live 
who excellent in the mystery of divination 
have leave that knowledge to her daughter 
enrich with thousand other modest virtue 
as be deliver to i by those be frequent with she 

do you believe what Phillida say 
be the voice of all your friend 

what be it 

that you shall marry with prince Lysicles 

I hear your uncle say the governor do 
receive it with all appearance of joy in hope 
this match will free he from this deep melancholy 
and it be determine the next feast join your hand 

the grave must be my bed then 
with what harsh fate do heaven afflict i 
that all those blessing which make other happy 
must be my ruin but if this lady knowledge 
shall inform i that I shall never enjoy Eugenio 
darkness shall cease near taper light 
my blush to the forswear Hymen right 

why shall you labour your disquiet cousin 
anticipate thus your knowledge you will make 
your future suffering present and so call 
a last grief upon you which your hope 
may dissipate till heaven have make your mind 
strong enough to encounter they

their own assistance 

fear not their power 

I do not but their will to help i I must doubt 
for those that know no reason of their hate 
must fear it be perpetual 
and let the ensign of their wrath fall on i 
if ere by any willing act I have 
provoke their justice to you now in who 
it be say as in their oracle they speak I come to 
know what mighty growth of danger be decree i 

first dear lady do not think my power 
great as my will to serve you it be so weak 
that if you shall rely on it I shall seem 
cold in your service when it do not answer

brand with such a line conclude it miserable 
when a eye that do resemble this 
teach it to weep betimes that so be lose 
it may not see those misery must be his only object 
be my misfortune of that horrid shape 
that the mere speculation do affright 
those who compassion only it concern 
I that must stand the stroke then what defence 
shall I prepare against they yet a hope 
that they be ripen now to fall on i 
lighten a desperate joy to my dark soul 
for the last dart shall be embrace 
as remedy to cure my former wound 

it be not that I be surprise in consider I must 
partake of all your fortune for our ascendant 
threaten like danger to we both 

be then my misery grow infection too 
must that be add pardon i gentle lady this sad crime 
I must account among my secret fault 
I mean no more but to communicate 
not part my sorrow with you 

will you can with what great willingness 
shall I embrace a share of what afflict you 
I will haste to meet and ease you of your fear 
now if to one who interest do force she 
to advance your hope you dare deliver 
the cause of your disquiet you shall find 
a closet if not a fort to vindicate your fear 

you shall know all I have exchange my heart 
with a young gentleman be now banish 
his country and my hope his rival labour 
to make i he my father resolute 
I shall consent till fortune change but 
lessen not my suffering for our prince 
Lysicles ruin i with the honour of his search 

do Eugenio know you love he 

no 

why do he doubt it 

a womanish scorn to have my love reveal 
make i receive his declaration of it 
as a affront unto my honour 
and when he come to take his leave 
I leave he in the opinion I will obey my father 

I have hear as much but contradiction 
in the prince action do amaze i 
they say he love your friend and labour now 
for to recall he and that every night 
he court his former flame hide in the ash 
of his lose mistress 

by this judge how miserable I be 
that my malignant star force they to change 
nature and virtue too that else will shine 
unmoved like the star that do direct 
the wander seaman must then nature change 
and will not fortune cease to persecute 
good god I will submit to all but breach of faith 

they will not hear we madam unless we 
contribute to their aid our best endeavour 
I have think a way may for a time secure you 
you must dissemble with the prince and seem 
to love ERGASTO 
it be not impossible but he see you 
prefer one so beneath he may provoke 
a just neglect from he then for ERGASTO 
beside the time you gain there may succeed 
a thousand way to hinder his pretence 

can my heart ever consent my tongue shall say 
I be to any other but Eugenio 
no my dear love though cruel fate have sever 
my vow embrace yet have death ice enough 
to fright all other from they 

I see love be a child still what a trifle 
do now disturb he you will not get your health 
of the price of say you be sick I know 
there be another remedy more proportion for your disease 
but not for you that suffer which be this 
tell the prince that you be engage but he 
that break with vow and friendship for your love 
will not desist for such suppose slight let 
and then your father will force you to his will 

if the prince leave i it be most certain 
he will use his power to make i take ERGASTO 

those that in danger that do press they near 
will not resolve 
upon some hazard and give leave to chance 
to govern what our knowledge can hinder 
must sit still and wait their preservation from a miracle 

I be determine for knife fire and sea shall lose 
their quality ere fate shall make i his 
and if death can be shun I will meet it bold 

cousin the prince be come to see you

with he before he go my heart do promise 
I shall do something in your service and

what now you utter of i that I glory 
my action be thus favour by your judgement 

we must forget our safety and the god 
who instrument you be of our deliverance 
when we be silent of the mighty debt

this declaration of your favour i will plead 
my pardon if I do omit the ceremonial circumstance 
which usual make way for this great truth 
I now must utter madam I do love

that the allseeing sun do not behold 
a lady that I love with equal ardour 
our friend have most power over we both

what easy conquest you can make of all

the weakness of our sex who will be proud 
only to have the show of your affection 
than real love of any they can hope 
with justice to attain to 

whatever I deserve 
the god have large recompense my intent 
of do virtuous if it have gain so much 
upon your goodness as to make a way for my affection

and frequent service shall first have smooth 
the way they be to take my happiness

I dare not understand you you be too noble 
to glory in the conquest of a heart 
that ever have admire you and to think

as to believe i fit to be your wife 
be a presumption that swell pride 
must be the father of which never yet 
my heart can be ally to continue prince 
be the example of a constant love 
and let not your milesia ash shrink 
with a new pierce cold which they will feel 
in the instant that your heart shall be consent 
to any new affection and give i leave to say 
your mind can never admit a noble love 
if it have banish she your memory 

must that be argument of cruelty 
which shall be cause of pity and will you 
assume the patronage of envious fortune 
by add torment unto her affliction 
must I be miserable in lose you

how great and just they be and only mean 
by mention MILESIA to confess 
how much unworthy I be to succeed she 
in your affection which though you bend 
as low as I dare raise myself to reach 
it be now impiety for i to grasp 
I be no more my own disposer 

ha what fate have take you from yourself 

the lord ergasto importunity 
who though at first no inclination 
of i make i affect his vow 
have vanish my determination 
I find nothing in myself deserve 
the constancy of his affection to i 
beside my father often urge i 
to make my choice obey his command 
and threaten misery if I decline the least 
know his violent nature I consent 
to a contract betwixt i and the lord ENGASTO 

o the prophecy of my unjust fear how true 
my heart foretold you 
madam it can be you shall affect 
one that have no desert but what you give 
by make he a part of you my hope 
though always blast can not apprehend 
a fear from he I shall be happy yet 
if any worthy love shadow my shame 
of be refuse by you 

give not my want of power to serve your grace 
the cruel title of refuse you 
your merit be so great you may assure 
yourself of all you can desire that be possible 
to grant who thousand worthy than myself 
will kneel to 
by my life if my faith be not give I will 
here offer up myself to be dispose by you 
though no ambitious pride can flatter i 
you can descend to raise i to your height 

must this be add to my former grief 
that in the instant you profess to pity 
what I must suffer in your loss your virtue 
for which I admire you must exclude 
my hope of ever change your resolve 
yet let my vow gain thus much of you 
that for a month you will not marry he 
I know your father will not force you to it 
for he not know what have pass between you 
consent to this visit 

by all thing holy this I swear to do 
though violent disease shall enclose i 
till the priest join our hand yet if you please 
let not my father know but he be the cause 
I dare not look upon the mighty blessing 
your love do promise 

may I not know the reason 

that he may know that this unquestioned power 
have force i to that error which himself 
and I must ever mourn unpitied 

now you throw oil upon the wound you make 
I may be ignorant of all thing else 
but of my want of merit to deserve 
I be most perfect in be happy lady 
he that enjoy you shall not need that prayer 
my father business call i 

let i entreat you that you will see a lady 
who virtue do deserve the honour of our knowledge 

what be she 

a egyptian lady late come to Cirrha 

I have hear of she they say she know our 
action past and future 

when you know she you will believe i 
that virtue choose that dark inhabitation 
to hide her treasure from the envious world 
I will call she to your grace 

madam this be the prince 

you need not tell i it though this be the first 
time that I see he since I come to Cirrha 
his fame do make he know to all that be 
remote from he 

my misery indeed have make it great 
for all thing else I shall be more 
behold unto silence than the voice 
of my most partial friend why do you gaze upon i so 

have you not late lose a lady that do love you dear 

if you do measure time by what I suffer 
my undiminish grief tell i but now 
but now I lose she if the sad minute 
that have oppress i since the fatal stroke 
it be a age eternity of torment I have feel 

good sir withdraw a little I shall deliver 
what you believe none know beside myself 

most true it be what god that hear our 
vow have tell it you 
but if your eye pierce far in their secret 
than our weak fancy can give credit to 
tell i if where she be she can discern and know my action 

most perfect she do and mourn your loss of faith 
that now begin after so many vow 
so many oath you will be only she 
to think of a new choice 

this may be conspiracy I will try it further 

have you be snatch from she and for her sake 
murder as she for you your urn cold ash 
shall have hide her fire of faithful love 
pardon i my lord 
her injure spirit inspire i with this boldness 

I be certain this be no inspiration of the god 
it can be she shall consent my faith 
shall be the ruin of my name and memory 
which necessary must follow if virtuous love 
do not continue it to future age 

fame of a constant lover will eternize it 
more than a numerous issue will you hear 
herself express her sorrow 

if I shall desire it it be impossible 

you conclude too fast if this night you will come 
unto her tomb you there shall see she 

though she bring thunder in her hand I will not fail to come 
and though I can credit that your power can procure it 
my hope be it shall be so will overcome my reason 
lady I be your servant 

madam I can stay to know particular 
of what have pass betwixt you and the prince 
only tell i how he relish your say you 
be promise to ERGASTO 

respect to one I seem to have make choice of 
make he forbear his character 
but shall not I be punish seem to prefer 
one so unworthy both to Eugenio and this noble prince 

the god give we permission to be false 
when they exclude we from all other way 
which may preserve our faith 
long I dare not stay I be your servant 

now we be meet what shall we do to keep we together 

let we take some argument may last a hour of mirth 

if you will have ERGASTO be of the parley it must 
be of the lady for he be desperate in love 

if the disease grow old in he I will pay the physician 
but be it so and let it be lawful to change as often as we will 

what the lady 

the discourse of they and themselves too if we 
can arrive to it but what be she you love 

one that I will sacrifice half my life 
to have but a week enjoy of 

at these game of love we set all but the best be 
we can stake and there be no loss of credit in the break 
Cleon have thou see he with his mistress 

yes and he stand gaze on she as if he be beg 
of a alm 

it be not ill do but do he not speak to she 

never but in hyperbole tell she her eye be star 
which astronomer shall only study to know our fate by 

it be not amiss if she have neither of the extreme 

what do you intend 

I mean neither so ill favour as to have 
no ground for what we say for their belief 
will hardly enter nor so handsome as to have 
it often speak to she for your indifferent beauty 
be those who flattery surprise there be 
so natural a love and opinion of ourselves 
that we be adapt to believe that man be rather 
deceive in we than abuse we 

your limitation take away much of my answer 
but grant all that you say I have no hope of 
obtain my mistress 

then thou have yet a year of happiness 
but why I prithee 

she be so deserve she think none worthy 
of her affection and so can love none 

you have more cause to doubt that she will never 
affect you than that already she be not in love 
what a young handsome lady that carry the flame of her heart in her cheek not have yet see any one to desire it be impossible 

I be of your mind till I have experience 
of the contrary 

conceit of yourself make you of the opinion 
I mention you think it be impossible for all man 
what you can attain to what art 
have you use to gain she 

he know none but distil sigh 
at the altar of her beauty 

if he be subject to that frenzy I will 
counsel he to take any trade upon he 
rather than that of love 

and do you think there be any thing fit 
to call down affection than submission 

nothing more opposite for languish transport 
whining and melancholy make we more laugh at 
than belove of our mistress and with reason 
for why shall we hope to deserve their favour 
when we confess we merit not a lawful esteem of ourselves 

I have know some their mistress have forsake 
only because they be certain the world take notice 
they be deep in love with they 

and they do wise for the victory be get 
they be to prepare for a new triumph and 
not like your city officer ride still with the 
same livery some I confess have miscarry 
in it but it be because their provision of 
beauty be spend before they come to composition 

thou be it a excellent fool in a chamber if you 
continue you will be so in a comedy do believe 
thou can swagger they out of their love 

soon than soften their heart by my tear 
and though a river shall run through i 
I will seal up my eye before a drop shall 
come that way for our unmanly submission 
raise they to that height that they think 
we be large favour if they harken to we with contempt 

it be safe they shall do so than hate we for our insolence 

if thou have ever be use to talk sense 
I shall wonder at thou now why I shall 
soon hope to gain a lady after the murder 
of her family than after she have a opinion 
I deserve to be slight by she 

before Venus he talk with authority I know 
not well what he have say but methinks 
there be something in it prithee let we hearken to he 

do and if I do not dispossess you of all your 
opinion let i be 

you must deal by enchantment then for I be 
resolve to stick to my conclusion 

it be the best holdfast your foolish devil have 
but strong reason shall be your exorcism 
tell i first what be she you love 

will I can 

then for all thy jest there be some hope 
thou be yet in thy wit 

you mistake i I mean I can not tell because 
no tongue can speak she to her merit 

heyday if the ballad of the rose and the honeycomb 
do not do it more than she deserve or almost any woman 
let i be condemn to sing the funeral of parrot 

will the lady hear you 

they will believe i though they will be 
sorry your honour shall but what this love 
have it transform we all Cleon you can tell 
who it be he thus admire 

yes and will it be Hermione Pindarus his heir 
Ph what Epictetus in a petticoat she that dispute love into nothing or what be worse a friendship with a woman 

the same and I know you will confess she be deserve 

yes but the mischief be she will never think so 
of he if polygamy be in fashion I will 
persuade he to marry she to be governess to the rest 
but not till then will thou be content 
to lie with a statue that will never confess more of love 
than suffer the effect of thou 

and have his liberty in the discourse of her friend 
that her retiredness may be more magnify 

believe i ERGASTO these severe beauty that 
be to be look on with the eye of respect 
be not for we we must have they that love to 
be praise more for fair lady than judicious 

you mistake i gentleman I choose for myself not for you 

faith for that whoever marry must sacrifice 
to fortune and she who wisdom make her 
snow to you may be fire to another some odd 
wrinkle fellow that conquer she with wit 
may throw she on her back with reason take 
this from the oracle that for the general 
calamity of husband all woman be repute 
vicious and for the quiet of particular 
every one think his wife the phoenix 

you have meet with rare fortune 

calumny be so general that truth have lose 
her credit but to the purpose what rival what hope 

a potent rival take away all Lysicles do woe her 

good night I will dispute it no more whether thou 
shall have she or no for now I conclude it be impossible 

I have her father firm consent before he declare himself 

though thou have she too be wise and despair 
betimes in this point woman be commonwealth 
and be oblige to their faith no far 
than the safety and honour of the state be 
concern if thou be it the first example I 
will excuse thou for be the first cozen 
but stay who be here 

of my conscience a embassage from some of 
your kind mistress that will fain take their 
leaf before you go to captivity 

be it possible 

she desire you to see she and believe that ambition 
can gain more upon she than your affection 

take this ring and this 

I dare not sir 

I will pay thy dowry then within this half hour 
I will wait on she 

from what part of the town come this fair day 
in a cloud that make you look so cheerful 

a alas gentleman I be bear to know nothing 
of love but sigh and despair 
I can be servant to none that have the election of two 

unriddle unriddle 

it be the servant of Hermione that come to 
have nigh wait upon her lady 

Phormio what do you think of this 

I will think at all for fear I judge amiss 
the maze of a woman be so intricate no 
precept can secure we yet this I be resolve on 
she will not love you 

why send she for he then 

the devil that advise she can tell you they 
will not lose a servant while he live 
though they command he to be murder it be the 
woman art if they perceive a lover to desist 
through fear distrust or harsh usage they 
open he the heaven of their beauty in smile 
and yield look and with their eye do melt 
the ice of doubt their fear contract perhaps 
prince Lysicles spur cold while he ride 
alone and you must strain to make he go 
the fast Eugenio too be servant to your 
mistress and Lysicles and he part good friend 
shall I think all the way they have to cozen 
they it be endless but I will along with you 
and guess at more 

Tell my lord Lysicles I will attend he in the walk 
where be this ungrateful child who the just god 
have curse so much they will not let she take 
the blessing they do offer 

here sir on her knee beg your pardon or your pity 

can thou hope either from my injure patience 
vex by thy folly into rage and madness 
what colour now to cover disobedience 
be Lysicles unworthy or your knowledge 
do it pierce far than the eye of all 
into Eugenio virtue I tremble 
when I think thou may have cause 
to know he to thy shame do not confess it 
by the just god if I do come to know it 
I will sacrifice thou on thy mother tomb 

what secret sin call down this punishment 
that I shall be accuse of a fault 
I dare not hear the sound of add not sir 
suspicion of new crime unto your rage 
the fault I have commit be enough to arm 
your justice bring i to the tomb 
and kill i there my mother ghost will smile 
to see my blood shed to preserve my faith 

your faith 

yes sir 
nor be my disobedience so swell 
as you endear it by your passion 
I now obey your general command 
of do virtuous in love he 
you do applaud while my poor brother live 

but you be not the same it be never mean 
he shall enjoy you if your brother die 

I be not make acquaint with so much 
but strengthen by your approbation 
give up my will to his and vow to heaven 
to know no other man for husband 

nor I no child if you continue thus 
nor will I argue more to make you doubt 
I be not resolute in my intent 
a live or dead I will give thou in the hand of Lysicles 

good god if you be move with tear grant 
this a trial only of the weak proportion 
of virtue you have lend i not the overthrow 

how be it dear cousin 

as with a martyr almost as much please with 
knowledge what I dare to suffer for Eugenio 
as grieve with my affliction fortune in her 
malice have give i yet a field to exercise 
my faith and love to he I do adore 

while you believe you have such cause to grieve 
all comfort seem importunate but yet prince Lysicles 

but what forbear I fear thy thought 
be poison which thou will fain infuse 
to wound my constancy 

sure there be magic in that mystic name 
it can not else divide we from our reason 
what law what faith can bind we to remove 
love of ourselves and reverence to our parent 
you must forgive this your Eugenio 
if he be here must speak as i do now 
grant his love be great as his profession 
for that must have reflection on your peace 
not bargain for his own happiness 
with the price of the entire destruction 
of you what be it you fear report 
it will reproach your be obstinate 
or breach of faith do you fear 
the god for you have make it not a fault 
propose such a object as prince Lysicles 

whoever have a misery like i 
all that be grieve have yet the liberty 
and ease of their complaint or pity friend 
i be exclude both for my misfortune 
be mask with happiness and if I grieve 
such comfort as we give to those complain 
of be too rich have I smile of contempt 

if it be thus retire into your reason 
and for a time forget your passion 
do you think that all the name of virtue shrink 
into the sound of constancy must this 
make you forget the debt that you do owe 
unto your father friend and to yourself 
their house honour and your happiness 
be Lysicles less worthy than his rival 

no more their virtue that exceed all other man 
in they be equal 

but yet their fortune be not 

it be confess nor never any man have just claim 
than he against she rich in all virtue 
that make man desire her narrow hand 
exclude he unwonted to bestow 
her treasure there where a excess of merit 
will make her gift but seem the pay of virtue 
not favour of her partial love 
o you be welcome here behold a rock 
that stand the shame of the impetuous wind 
and the swell sea 

have there be any new storm since I go 

o yes and more endanger song of siren 
a flourish land propose on which I may 
have shipwrack with delight 

I think I understand you 

you must needs 
it be prince Lysicles present in his lustre 
against who I arm the virtue of my friend 
and my own faith irresolute to who 
the victory shall yield at last I leave 
my heart the prize to both divide 

to both divide 

yes the prince have the adoration of my heart 
Eugenio the love 

what fire what sea must your Eugenio pass 
to make he worthy you methinks I feel 
his soul sigh for a trial of his faith 

we both have have satiety of that 
but can you bring no comfort have the god 
shut up their oracle as well as mercy 
though they will give no ease they may advise 
that we may put off misery by death 

they seldom let we know what be to come 
that we may still implore their aid to help we 
yet something I can tell if hope or force 
shall make you deviate from your resolve 
you be the subject of their hate or if 
you measure your or their affection 
by merit or advantage of fortune 
you be the mark of all disaster 

I have complain unjust of the god 
they favour i so much they do applaud 
my resolution for Eugenio 
merit in other I will close my eye 
from the bless sun before they shall take in 
a object that may startle my firm faith 

be constant and be happy when you meet 
with opposition that may shake your judgement 
Remember what affliction it be to weep 
a fault irreparable and think not 
reason can pacify your father rage 
you must oppose your passion unto he 
and love will be victorious be the noble 
tomorrow I will bring more certain council 

where can virtue dwell what a still shade 
have she find out to live secure in 
from the attempt of man Come my Irene 
though thou have speak treason against my love 
because thou do produce it I must thank thou 
let we in and fortify ourselves with some sad tale 
of those who perjure love have make they live 
hate and die most miserable 

if i shall weep as my lady do for all the 
servant I have lose 

thou will weep in thy grave Phillida yet the 
worst be thou will lose more within this seven 
year than thou have get in ten for man be 
changeable sweet Phillida 

and our face be not it be no matter 
they shall make haste or we she shall overtake they 
or prevent they a commodity of beauty that 
will last forty year will bear a good price madam 

by Venus will it Phillida as high as that of honour 

but be not my lady a strange woman to weep 
thus for one servant when she have another in 
his place for my part I can never find such 
difference in man to be sad when I have any 

and thy word may be take as soon as any wench 
in Greece or there be slanderer in the world 
but she affect constancy 

some illfavoured woman that mean to preserve 
her last purchase which her want of beauty 
forfeit invent that name 

thou be in the right Phillida this inconstancy be 
a monster without tooth for it devour none 
make no son wear happy mourning nor 
mother childless and for my part I be of 
opinion that the god give a blessing to it for 
none live happy than those that have great 
abundance of it 

what be get by this whine constancy but the loss 
of that beauty for one servant which will procure we 
the vow sacrifice and service of a thousand 

enough of this be it thou with Ergasto 

yes and tell he that my lady send for he 
but to what intent do you make i lie

to have power over those it have select 
my tear and sacrifice can never gain 
so much upon its mercy as to lend 
thy happy sight for one faint minute comfort 
yet those that sell themselves to hell can force 
thy quiet rest for inquisition on innocence 
and to what purpose serve faith and religious secrecy

under the ruin of thy uncle house

So this be the first degree to my revenge 
which I will prosecute till I have make

on which I will sacrifice the murderer 
to appease the spirit of my injure mistress 
and the last victim I will fall myself 
upon her sacred tomb to expiate 
the crime I have commit in defer 
justice thus long this curse magician 
shall be the first she do reveal our love 
MILESIA say she do and if it be 
her bless spirit nothing but truth dwell in it 
if it be a phantom raise by her foul spell 
she pay the fault of her abuse i 
insidiate with my milesia form 
to search and then betray my resolution 
of serve my best friend how now

near the house of the egyptian lady 
something be do that disturb they all

chamber find she on her bed almost distract 
with torture cry she be poison curse her 
jealousy and curiosity call upon your name 
desire and then forbid you shall be send for

that have attempt thy look down MILESIA 
applaud my piety that snatch the sword 
from sleep justice to revenge thy death 

what mean my lord to be please with this 
sad news how can this stranger have offend he 
I will follow learn the issue and the cause 

o o o god if I have merit your hate 
you may have lay it on until my name 
have be a word to express full misery 
and I have thank you if you have forbear 
to make his innocence the instrument 
of your dire wrath Hermione Irene 
I have conjure my servant not to tell you 
when I be dead who I be but if 
their weakness shall discover it let it be hide 
from the best Lysicles I burn I burn 
and death dare not to cease i fright 
with the fury that torment i 

mysterious power instruct we in the way 
you will be serve for we be ignorant 
your thunder else will not be aim at those 
that follow virtue as it be prescribe 
while thousand other escape unpunished 
that violate the law we be teach to keep 

what mean these sad expression of sorrow 

o my lord nature have not make our heart 
capable of pity if we forbear it here 
the virtuous Acanthe have be torment 
with pain nothing be able to express 
but her own groan she fear she be poison

and in the midst of all her torture 
say her distrust and jealousy deserve a great punishment 

and I believe it nor shall you pity she

the god reserve unto themselves do never do it 
but with intent to ruin the believer 
and venture on their art something I know 
of the curse effect of her command magic

of infinite more mischief than be yet reveal 
I be confident she be flee her country 
for the ill she have do there and now 
the punishment have overtake she here

to hide the rottenness that lie within 
and gain her credit with some dissemble act 
of piety which level she a passage 
to those important mischief hell 
have employ she here to execute

the god you have offend by your curse art 
the bless ghost you send i too have tell i 
some sad effect on it and in her name 
and cause have the god hurl this punishment 
on thy foul soul and make my grief enrage 
to madness the bless instrument of thy destruction 
which do but here begin 

you then do send the poison with the present I receive 

yes I do and wonder you dare tempt 
my just revenge unless you do believe 
you can confine the revelation 
of the best spirit your curse charm 
betray first and then enforce to leave 
their happy seat to perfect the design 
your malice labour in 

what unknown way have the god invent 
to punish i I feel a torment 
no tyranny ever parallel yet must confess 
a obligation to he that impose it 
good god if I do bow under your will 
without repine at your sad decree 
grant this to recompense my martyrdom 
that he that be the author of my suffering 
may never learn his error 
sir if torment ever can expiate the crime 
we have commit i may challenge your pardon 
and your pity I feel death enter i 
love the memory of your Mylesia and forgive 

help help she die 

if it be possible call life into she for some minute 
her full confession will absolve my justice 

bring some water here she do but swoon 
so chafe her temple o heaven what prodigy 
be here her blackness fall away my lord look on 
this miracle do not heaven instruct we in pity 
of her wrong that the opinion which prejudice 
her virtue shall thus be wash away with the 
black cloud that hide her pure form 

heaven have some further end in this 
than we can pierce more water she return to life 
and all the blackness of her face be go 

Pallas Apollo what may this portend my lord 
have you not see a face like this 

yes and horror seize i it be the idea 
of my Milesia impenetrable power 
deliver we in thunder your intent 
and exposition of this metamorphosis 

she stir 

hold she up gentle he kneel 

o o why do you kneel to i 

be not you MILESIA 

why do you ask 

o then you be 

my Lysicles I be by miracle preserve 
though since the god repent they of their succour 
know i unworthy of thy firm constant love 
I never think that death can be a terror 
too long acquaint with the misery 
pursue our life but now the apprehension 
my grave shall swallow thou make i to welcome it 
with a heaviness that sink despair sinner 

pour down your thunder god upon this head 
and try if that can make i yet more wretched 
be not her death affliction enough 
but you must make i be the murderer 
be this a punishment for adore her 
equal with you you make so equal to you 
pardon the fault you force i to commit 
so visible a divinity can not be look on 
with less adoration 

if ever I do expect a happy death 
may I die loathe what funeral pomp 
can there be great than for i to hear 
while I yet live my die obsequy 
with so much zeal pronounce by he I love 
torture again do seize i 

eye be you dry where such a object call 
your tear forth my blood shall supply your place 

for heaven sake hold his hand oh my best Lysicles 
do not destroy the comfort of my soul 
what a division do I feel within i 
I be but half torment my soul in spite 
of the torture of my body do feel a joy 
that meet depart spirit in the bless shade 

what unexpected mischief circle i 
what art have malice arm with fortune find 
to make i wretched can I ever have think 
a miracle can have restore thou to my eye 
but they shall see the joy of heaven in thou 
yet now the height of my affliction be 
that they behold thou guilty of the close 
of thou for ever see Hermione 
the countenance death shall put on when death 
will have we throng unto her palace 
and court her freeze sepulchre 

sure she be dead how pale she be 

no she be white as lily as the snow 
that fall upon Parnassus if the red be here 
as I have see it enthrone the rise day 
will get new excellence by be compare to she 
Argos nor Cyprus Egypt never see 
a beauty like to this let it be lawful for i to usurp 
so much on death right as to take a kiss 
from thy cold virginlip where she and love 
yet strive for empire the flame that rise from hence 
be not less violent though less please now 
than when she do consent I shall receive 
what now I ravish 

dare not death shut those eye where love 
have enter once or be I in the shade 
assist with the ghost of my dear Lysicles 

she speak again good heaven she speak again 

you be yet live 

and therefore die but before I go 
let i obtain your pardon for the wrong 
my jealousy have throw upon your innocence 
it be my too perfect knowledge of my want 
of merit to deserve make i doubt you 
I mean your constant love which I will teach 
below and make they learn again to love 
who have die for it 

do not abuse your mercy and my grief 
by ask pardon of your murderer 
but curse your suffering off on this devote head 
to save the beauty of the world in you 

why shall your grief make i repent the joy 
I ever beg of heaven the knowledge 
of your love can there be add more 
unto my happiness than to be confirm 
by my own suffering how much you do love i 
and prosecute those that desire my ruin 
like Semele I die who can not take 
the full god in her arm 
I have but one wish more that I may bear 
unto the shade the glorious title of your wife 
if I may live so long to hear but this 
pronounce by Lysicles I die in peace 

hear it with my vow not to behold 
the sun rise after you be go 

o say not so live I command you live 
let your obedience unto this command 
show you have lose a mistress 

can I hear this and live 

my lord our care will be employ better 
in seek to avert this lady death 
than in deplore it 

you advise well run all to the physician 
I will myself to Arnaldo who give 
this poison to i let i have word send to the 
cypress grove the minute she be dead 

if life be give as a blessing to we 
what law compel we to preserve it long 
than we can see a possibility 
of be happy by it but we must expect 
till the same power that place we here command 
a restitution of his gift this be indeed a rule 
to make we live but not live happy 
it be true the slave that free himself by death 
do wrong his master but yet the god be not 
necessitous of we but we of they 
who then be injure if I kill myself 
and if I dare to hear their voice they call 
man to some other place when they remove 
the gust and taste of this we shall adore thou death 
if constant virtue not enforcement build 
thy spacious temple 
Welcome Eugenio welcome worthy friend 
how long be you arrive 

time enough to revenge though not prevent 
the injury you have do i

the mischief that be raise to swallow i 
that it invent new plague to batter i 
by all that be holy I never do offend my friend

do seldom fear profane of their name 
to hide their perjury will put it on they 
you have attempt my Hermione 
and force her father to compel her voice 
unto your marriage 

all this I do confess but it be for both your good 
as I will now inform you 

hell and fury because your specious title 
your spread vineyard and your guild house 
do shine upon our cottage must our faith 
which heaven do seal be cancel it be my virtue 
win her fair grace which still outshine 
your flame of vice 

it have not light enough to let you see your friend 
god can that man have live that dare to say 
Eugenio do suspect his Lysicles 
and now in pity you do show he i 
that I may fly the world without regreet 
not leave one of worth behind i in it 
begin and learn your error 

I have do it already they be trust you 
with my life happiness draw and restore the vow 
you make Hermione or I will leave you dead 
and tear they from your heart 

fond man thou do not know how much it be in 
my power to make thou miserable 
I can now force thou execute my wish 
in kill i and thou will fly the light 
when it have show thou who thy rage offend 
but till I fall by my own hand my life 
be chain unto my honour which I will wear 
upon my sepulchre nor must I die 
be guilty of milesia murder 
for any cause but she else be my breast 
since you have wrong i open to your point 

can you deny but that you have attempt 
the faith of my Hermione 

I can with so strong circumstance of truth 
will make you blush for have doubt i 
but he that be my friend and suspect i 
must attend less satisfaction than a stranger 
proceed and let your case be both your judge and guide 

what shall I do I dare not trust my sense 
if he shall tell i that it do deceive i 
virtue itself will lose her quality 
ere he forsake she and his word do fall 
distort from he his soul do labour 
under some heavy burden which my passion 
do hinder i from see sir forgive 
or take your full revenge let your own grief 
teach you to pity those be distract with it 
I will not rise until you pardon i 

o my Eugenio thy kindness have undo i 
my rage do choke my grief which now do spread 
itself over my soul and body up and help 
to bear i till I fall eternal 

who can hear this and not be turn to marble 
good sir impart your sorrow I may bring comfort 

while they be capable thou do but now 
they be too great and swell to let it in 
Milesia who you and i suppose dead 
by i today be poison and lie die in her torment 
be not this strange 

what have you say that be not 
but heaven avert this last 

it be too late now let i beg thy kindness

you can wish i such a hate office 
call up your reason and your courage to you 
which be not give you only for the war 
but to resist the battery of fortune 
people will say that Lysicles do want 
part of that courage fame do speak he lord of 
when they shall hear he sink below her succour 

you will not kill i then 

when I believe there be no other mean to ease you 
I will do it 

all but death be flee 

then draw your sword and as i lift my arm 
to sheathe this in your breast let you pierce i 
on this condition i may do your will

to think you can survive your die friend 

Eugenio I be conquer yet I hope thy kindness

and you will exhale her soul into your wound 
and be the death of she you mourn for live 
within where be prince Lysicles where be prince Lysicles

So it be well at length his hope have teach despair to fear 

madam my innocence will plead my pardon I can 
not guess for who my lord intend it the truth be 
I fear consider his deep melancholy he 
intend to use it on himself and therefore mean to 
make he out of love with death by suffer the pain 
our soul do feel when they be violence from we 
I have provide antidote but can not till this hour 
learn on who it be employ sure I be it can 
be death to none though full of torment 

till I have far mean thank you receive this ring 

but madam what do your poor Hermione deserve 
that you shall hide yourself from she 
or be you the Milesia that be please 
to call i friend or be she bury 
by Pallas temple true belief and memory 
oppose sense make doubt which to credit 
I weep you dead the virgin do entomb you 
be we then or no deceive 

my fair dear friend you shall know all my story 
it be true my uncle do design my death 
for love Lysicles for at his come hither 
he charge i by all tie that be between we 
to hate he as the ruin of his honour 
and yet for some dark end I understand not 
resolve to leave i here I swear obedience 
but know not what offence it be to keep 
a oath so make till I have see the Lysicles 
which at your house I do when he come wound 
from hunt of the boar all but his name 
appear most godlike to i you all do run 
to stop his wound and I think I may see 
my enemy blood yet soon do pity cease i 
to see he bleed thus love take the shape 
of pity glide unseen of i into my heart 
and while I think myself but charitable 
I nurse my infant love with milk of pity 
till he grow strong enough to take i prisoner 
I find his eye on i and ere I can 
remove they hear he say he will thank his fortune 
for this last wound if it be the cause 
of see i then take his leave 
but leave i speechless that I can not say 
my heart farewell after this visit our love 
grow to that height that you have hear of 

the grove and temple and dark shade have hear 
they mourn and celebrate by your friend 

I have a servant unsuspected of i 
for none I trust that observe our meeting 
and guess by my sigh that love have make they 
betray they to my uncle on Pallas eve 
he rush into my chamber his sword draw 
and snatch i by the arm I fall down 
but know yet no fault can beg no pardon 
a while our eye do only speak our thought 
at length out of his bosom he pull out 
a paper it be the contract betwixt my lord and i 
and ask i if I will avow the hand 
heaven say I have approve it and the god 
have choose this way to reunite our house 
stain of thy kindred honour he exclaim 
be there no other man to ease your lust 
but he that be our great enemy 
resolve to die thy blood shall hide the stain 
of our dishonour 

he can not be so cruel to intend it 

he be for leave i oppress with sigh 
and tear yet not of sorrow and repentance 
but fear that I shall lose my dear servant 
command his cruel slave to murder i 
as I descend and lest pity shall 
create remorse in their obdurate heart 
the light be all put out then hasty 
my name be hear I then entreat she 
that betray i tell they I be come 
and take this time to write unto my lord
