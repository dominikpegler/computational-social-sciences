enough these loud sound deaf my passion 
how long shall love make i a slave to hope 
and mix my calm desire with tyranny 
oh Phylocles it be heresy I hold 
think and affection can be control 

yet may it be bend and supple with extreme 
sith few dare see the end of violence 
what make the skilful leech to use the fire 
or war her engine or slate policy 
but to recover thing most desperate 
revolt be recreant when pursuit be brave 
never to faint do purchase what we crave 

true my Phylocles yet my recreant soul 
slave to her beauty will renounce all war 
and yield she right to love do not thy spirit 
mix with my longing fortify these arm 
but I be now resolve and this sad hour 
shall give a end to my distemperature 
summon a parley 

what say our tyrant suitor our disease in love 
that make our thought a slave unto his sword 
what say my lord 

madam attend i this be my late summons 
the many sun my sorrow have behold 
and my sad night of long all through hope 
to enjoy the joy of earth your own dear self 
be grow so infinite in length and weight 
that like to weary Atlas I enforce 
these war as Hercules to bear my load 
brief I must enjoy you or else lose 
the breath of life which to prevent behold 
my sword must be my Cupid and with feather steel 
force pity from your breast your city wall 
chide with my canon have set open a path 
and bold bid i enter all your man of war 
feeble with famine and a weary siege 
take danger from my action only yourself 
strong in your will oppose even destiny 
and like the giant war offend the heaven 
which to prevent do but descend and give 
peace to my lovesuit and as overcome thereby 
I will yield myself your prisoner and be draw 
a thrall in your triumphant victory 
if otherwise behold these fatal sword 
shall never be sheathe till we be conqueror 
and not respect innocence nor sex 
the cry of infant nor the prayer of age 
all thing shall perish till within my arm 
I foul yourself my thrall and conqueror 

thou may be master of my body tomb 
but for my soul and mind they be as free 
as their creation and with angel wing 
can soar beyond thy reach trust i king of cypress 
those coal the roman Portia do devour 
be not burn out nor have the Egyptian worm 
yet lose their sting steel hold his temper still 
and these be ransom from captivity 
but be thou noble have thou one royal thought 

approve i by your question 

then brief thus 
to shun the great effusion of their blood 
who feel no touch in my affection 
dare you to single combat two to two 
refer your right in love 

who be your combatant we love equality 

this be the first the Epire duke a man 
spring from the line of famous Scanderbag 
the next Alphonso spring from noble blood 
who lade with rich lusitanian prize 
have rod through Syracusa twice in pomp 

their like to the motion 

they be like wrath 
never unarmed to beat weak injury 

nay more we be the son of destiny 
virtue be our guide our aim be dignity 

'sfoot king shall not forsake they this I see 
love fight and death be rule by destiny 

my spirit speak thy motion 
madam although advantage may evade 
and give my love more hope yet my bent will 
bow to your pleasure do embrace your law 
we do accept the combat and ourself 
will with that duke try fortune this my friend 
the more part of myself i dear Philocles 
one of a angel temper shall with that that lord 
try best and worst the place the time the sword 

they be your right we claim as challenger 

and we will lose that vantage but since fame 
make virtue dulat we embrace our right 
the place before these wall the hour next sun 
the poleaxe and the hand axe for the fight 

it be enough 
my hostage be my person and my love 

and i my hope my faith and royalty 

they be of poise sufficient and one light 
shall at one instant give we day and night 

she be go my Philocles and as she go even so 
the sun forsake the heaven to kiss the sea 
day in her beauty leave we and methinks 
her absence do exile all happiness 
tell i my Philocles nay pray thou tell i true 
even from that love 
which to we both shall bend one sympathy 
discharge a open breast do thou not think 
she be the mirror of her beauteous sex 
unparalleled and uncompanioned 

envy will say she be rare than truth must vow 
she be beyond compare sith in her look 
each motion have a speak majesty 
she be herself compare with herself 
for but herself she have no companion 
but when I think of beauty wit and grace 
the element of active delicacy 
those all eyepleasing harmony of sight 
which do inchant man fancy and stir up 
the life blood of dull earth oh then methinks 
fair Mariana have a equal place 
and if not outshine it show more beautiful 

more than my queen 

more in the gloss of beauty less in worth 
of wisdom and great thought the one I find 
be make for wonder the other for admire 

thy equal praise make my fancy rich 
and I be please with thy comparison 
thing of like nature live in best consent 
beauty with subject majesty with king 
then let those two idea lively move 
spirit beyond all spirit in our breast 
that in the end of our great victory 
we may attain both love and majesty 

although my first creation and my birth 
my thought and other temper of my soul 
take all their noble being from the sword 
and make i only for the use of war 
yet in this combat something methinks appear 
great than great glory and do raise 
my mind beyond herself 
'sfoot methinks Caesar Pharsalia 
nor Scipio Carthage nor Emily act 
be worthy chair of triumph they over man 
poor mangle body and firewasted clime 
make their triumphant passage but we two 
must conquer thought and love more than the god can do 

true and therein 
consist the glorious garland of our praise 
but we neglect the affair of preparation Florio be it your charge 
to see the erection of the square list 
fit ground for either army and what else 
belong unto such royal eminence 

how near will your majesty hand the list extend 
unto the city wall 

so as the dull eye 
may see the heedful passage in the fight 

what square or circuit 

threescore pace each way 

your majesty shall have your will perform 

do and you do we grace and now thou sun 
that be the eye of heaven who pure sight 
shall be our guide and jove great chronicler 
look from thy sphere 
no guilt of pride of malice or of blood 
put on our armour only pure naked love 
tutor our hope and do our action move 

enough my Philocles thy orison be hear 
come let we away 

now fie upon it who will be a orator wife and not a gentlewoman if she can choose a lady be the most sweet lascivious life conieyes and kiss the tire oh the tire make castle upon castle jewel upon jewel knot upon knot crown garland garden and what not the hood the rebato the french fall the loose body gown the pin in the hair now claw the pate then pick the tooth and every day change when we poor soul must come and go for every man pleasure and what be a lady more than another body we have leg and hand and roll eye hang lip sleek brow cherry cheek and other thing as lady have but the fashion carry it away 

why how now mistress Prat in the old disease still will it never be better can a woman find one kind man among twenty o the day that I have see when the law of a woman wit can have put she husband purse to execution 

o mistress Collaquintida i be even the unnatural man to his wife 

faith for the most part all scholar be so for they take so upon they to know all thing that indeed they know nothing and beside they be with study and ease grow so unwieldy that a woman shall near want a sore stomach that be trouble with they 

and yet they must have the government of all 

true and great reason they have for it but a wise man will put it in a woman hand what she will save what he spend 

you have a pretty ruff how deep be it 

nay this be but shallow marry I have a ruff be a quarter deep measure by the yard 

Indeed by the yard 

by the standard I assure you you have a pretty set too how big be the steel you set with 

as big as a reasonable sufficient pity of my life I have forget myself if my husband shall rise from his study and miss i we shall have such a coil 

a coil why what coil if he be my husband and do but thwart i I will ring he so many alarm sound he so many brass trumpet beat he so many drum to his confusion and thunder he such a peal of great shot that I will turn his brain in the pan and make he mad with a eternal silence 

o mistress coloquintida but my husband anger be the worst favouredst without all conscience of any man in all Sicily he be even as peevish as a sick monkey and as waspish as a ill please bride the second morning 

let your wrath be reciprocal and pay he at his own weapon but to the purpose for which I come the party you wot of commend he to you in this diamond he that meet the party you know and say the party party be a party of a partly pretty understanding 

o the lord Alphonso 

the very same believe it he love you and swear he so love you that if you do not credit he you be worse than a infidel 

indeed mistress coloquintida he have the right garb for apparel the true touch with the tongue in the kiss and he dance well but fall heavy but my husband woman my husband if we can put out his cat eye there be something to be say but they be ever peep and pry that they be able to pierce through a millstone beside I may say to you he be a little jealous too and see where he come we shall have a coil now 

begin you to pout first for that be a woman prevention 

what Lollia I say where be you my house look you my man lack you I seek you and a whole quest of inquiry can find you fie fie fie fie idleness be the whip of thrift a good huswife shall ever be occupy 

indeed I have much joy to be occupy in anybody company 

why what be the matter 

why orator wife short will be know like image on water stair ever in one weatherbeaten suit as if none wear hood but monk and lady nor feather but forehorse and wait gentlewoman nor chain but prisoner and lord officer nor periwig but player and hot brain but the weak must to the wall still 

go to you shall have what you will 

nay nay it be my hard fortune to be your wife time be I may have do otherwise but it matter not you esteem i as you do yourself and think all thing costly enough that cover shame and that a pair of silken foresleeve to a satin breastplate be a garment good enough for a capitol but be master Wrangle master tangle or master Trobleare of that opinion in faith sir no 
there be never a gallant in our state 
that go more rich in gaudy bravery 
and yet I hope for quality of speech 
audacious word or quirk or quiddity 
you be not hold their much inferior 
fie fie I be ashamed to see your baseness 

indeed master prate she tell you true I wonder that you be a proper man and a orator will not go brave accord to the custom of the country 

go to neighbour he that will rise to the top of a high ladder must go up not leap up but be patient wench and thou shall short see i gallant it with the best and for thyself my Lollia 
not Lollia Paulina nor those blaze star 
which make the world the ape of Italy 
shall match thyself in sunbright splendency 

nay very for myself I care not it be you that be my pride if you will go like yourself I be appease 

believe it wench so I will but to the purpose for which I come the end of this great war be now bring to a combat two to two the duke of Epire and Alphonso for our queen against the king and prince Philocles now wench if thou will go see the fight I will send and provide thou of a good stand 

indeed for you have never a good one of your own

how master how must I provide a good stand for you for my mistress true master I think a marry bone pie candy orange preserve date or marmalade of cantharides be much better harbinger cock sparrow stew dove brain or swan pizzle be very provocative roast potato or boil skirret be your only lofty dish methinks these shall fit you better than I can do 

what be this what be this I say provide i a stand for my wife upon a scaffold 

and true master I think a private chamber be better 

I grant you if there be a chamber convenient 

willing mind will make shift in a simple hole close window strong lock hard bed and sure post be your only ornament 

I think the knave be mad sirrah you chop logic blockhead you that have your brain pan make of dry leather and your wit ever wetshod pack about your business or I will pack your pen and inkhorn about your care

nay do not hide your eye I love they still 
to part friend now be great charity 
o be thy day as fruitful in delight

shall sing the careful story of my death 
give i a sigh from thy heart pure breath 
and so farewell 

madam kneel here forgive i for your death 

with all my heart thou be but law poor hand 
thus to my death I bow and yet arise 
angel protect my spirit in the sky

endeavour her recovery 

sister dear sister call thy spirit back 
sister oh sister harken to my woe 
recover breath and live with happiness 

she stir give way to air that she may breathe 
speak Mariana thy woe be cancel 

you be not charitable unto my moan 
thus to afflict i with a double punishment 
one death for one poor fault may well suffice 
they be most wretched who twice live and die 

madam to save your life I kill my soul 
and speckle that which be immaculate 
black perjury that open eye disease 
which be the plague sore of society 
brand i with mischief and protest I hold 
nothing within i but unworthiness 
and all these ill be your creation 

which to wash off lo here I yield myself 
a humble sacrifice to love and thou 
all my best hope my fortune and my love 
my faith my service and my loyalty 
shall as thy slave attend on thy command 
and make i famous in my suffrage 

receive she Philocles for it please we 

but not i my thrice royal sovereign 
I will rather wed a sooty blackamoor 
a leper monster incubus or hag 
a wretch deform in nature loathe of man 
than she that have bemonster my pure soul 
her scorn and pride have almost lose her life 
a maid so fault seldom prove good wife 

what be the reason you not love she now 
and be so passionate in love before 

not that I love she less but rather more 
run I this backward course only my vow 
sith unperformed crave satisfaction 
which thus I reconcile when this fair maid 
shall with as strong a love as firm a zeal 
a faith as constant and a shame as strong 
requite my care and show as ample proof 
in my extreme as I have in her death 
then will I love enjoy and honour she 
till when I will not think a love thought 
or give the easy temper of my mind 
to lovesick passion or deliciousness 
only with those which do adore the sun 
I will give she all respect and reverence 

I be well please and with a doubtful foe 
you have good reason thus to capitulate 
then hang your colour forth extend your thought 
muster your strong power of strict wit 
and when your reason best artillery bend 
love not my love if it be not excellent 

I have not see a war breed better wit 
or passion draw on more delightfulness 
proceed in your contention for we boast 
that love be best which be approve most 
but now to revel since our tragic scene 
be turn to comic mirthful constancy 
in stead of mourn we will dance and banquet 
and fill our empty vein with all delight 
for oft we find that storm and sorrow prove 
the best forerunner of a happy love 

he will but he will not love but can like 
will and affection in this prince be like 
two bucket which do never both ascend 
or those star twin which shine not in one sphere 
o Philocles I see thy soul grow fat 
and feed upon the glory of my same 
but I will forestall thy epileptic fit 
and by my plot breed thy destruction 
revenge now rule as sovereign of my blood 
and other ruin shall advance my good 
which once attain to I will prove ambitious 
great man like god be never thoughtvitious 
now Philocles stand fast king guard thy crown 
for by this brain you both shall tumble down 

this be his chamber let we enter here be his clerk 

fondling say he since I have hem thou here 
within the circuit of this ivory pale 

I pray you sir help we to the speech of your master 

I will be a park and thou shall be my dear 
he be very busy in his study 
feed where thou will in mountain or on dale 
stay a while he will come out anon 
graze on my lip and when those mount be dry 
stray low where the pleasant fountain lie 
go thy way thou best book in the world 

I pray you sir what book do you read 

a book that never a orator clerk in this kingdom but be beholden unto it be call maid philosophy or Venus and Adonis look you gentleman I have diverse other pretty book 

you be very well store sir but I hope your master will not stay long 

no he will come present 

who have we here another client sure crow flock to carcase oh it be the lord Meshant 

save you gentleman sir be your master at any leisure 

here sit thou down where never serpent hiss 
and be set I will smother thou with kiss 
his business yet be many you must needs attend a while 

we must attend umh even snail keep state 
when with slow thrust their horn peep forth the gate 
we must attend it be custom fault not my 
to make man proud on who great favour shine 
it be somewhat against my nature to attend 
but when we must we must be patient 
a man may have admittance to the king 
as soon as to these long robe and as cheap 
Come gentleman shall we walk 
thus be the pavement stone before the door 
of these great tongue guilt orator wear smooth 
with client dance for they 

it be strange to see how the world wait upon they therein they be the only man now 

o only they of all man in request 
your physician be the lawyer for your health 
and moderate unruly humour best 
other be nobody compare with he 
for all man neglect their health in regard of their profit 

true and that be it make these man grow so fat 
swell with rich purchase 

yea with golden fee 
and golden title too they can work miracle 
and like creator even of empty nothing 
erect a world of goodly live fair demean 
and gallant manor heap one on another 

they gain indeed excessive and be not like we citizen 
expose to hazard of the sea and traffic 

why here be a fellow now this orator 
even Prat you will little think it his father be 
a honest pruner of our country vine 
yet he be shoot to his footcloth 

o he be he prune he well and bring he up to learning 

faith reasonable learning a smattering in the latin tongue 
a little rhetoric with wrangle sophistry 
be his preparative unto his art 

after these preparative if you call they so 
the physic wrought well for a few year practise 
bring he in wondrous credit and preferment 
come tumble in oh such a sudden rise 
have fortune for her minion blame he not then 
though he look high on it 

nay for his pride of weak soul term state 
it hurt none but himself 

yet to my seem it be very strange 
that from so base beginning man can breathe 
such soar fame 

strange it be not strange a whit 
dunghill and marish bog dart store of vapour 
and viscous exhalation against heaven 
which borrow luster there though base breed 
seem yet like glorious planet fair star 
to the weak eye of wonder ignorance 
when wise man know they be but meteor 
but here come the orator

to you to she and sacred chastity 

duke thou be valiant and with a valiant mind 
slander be worse than theft or sacrilege 
nay more than murder or the height of treason 
a step beyond the utmost plague in hell 
then thou which in that nature wrong a queen 
deserve a scourge beyond their punishment 
virtue shall kill thou now

as wanton speech to stir appetite 
and all enchantment that inflame desire 
when you return than all be hush and still 
and she demure walk like virtue ghost 
before your face she be like a Puritan 
behind your back a blush courtesan

a creature uncreate in paradise 
and one that be only of a woman make 

be it possible can I give faith to this 

nay be but patient smooth your brow a little 
and you shall take they as they clip each other 
Even in their height of sin then dam they both 
and let they stink before they ask God pardon 
that your revenge may stretch unto their soul 

to be a cuckold do exceed all grief 

to have a pleasant scoff at majesty 

to taste the fruit forbid from my tree 

but he shall lose his paradise for that 

the slave will make base song in my disgrace 

and wound your reputation in strange land

watch their close meeting and then give we notice 
mean space my love shall in thy bosom rest 
my grief be like my birth great great and high 
give close intelligence till then farewell 
lust be the broad path which lead to hell 

he be go with black suspicion in his heart 
and make his soul a slave to jealousy 
my plot shall drive he to his own destruction 
and I gain both revenge and dignity 
he shall no soon put his queen to death 
but I will proclaim her spotless innocence 
all man will hate he for so vile a act 
and mad with rage depose he from his crown 
then I will be his death his state do give 
king once depose long after must not live 
for like a phoenix rare in jealousy 
he shall consume himself in scorch flame 
while from his ash I a phoenix spring 
many renounce their god to be a king 
and I will be one to kill man with a frown 
None dare dispute the action of a crown 

the queen be all for revel her light heart 
unlade from the heaviness of state 
bestow itself upon delightfulness 

she follow her creation and her sex 
in my conceit it be as vile a thing 
to see the worthy model of a woman 
who have not be at all but to give life 
and stir spleen to man alacrity 
to sit overwhelm with thought with dark amuse 
and the sad sullenness of a grieve dislike 
as to behold a old man in his fur 
who well spend youth have give his age full strength 
to be his country best physician 
to caper to his grave and with vain gaud 
trick up his coffin and upon his tomb 
to leave no knowledge but his levity 

it be true indeed and nature in herself 
do give we still distaste in contrary 
and in my thought it be as base to see a woman man 
as see a man a long robe feminine 

well we forget ourselves my lord what be the music ready I pray you command the guard to take their halberd in their hand the usher shall have see this room perfume in faith they be too negligent here come the queen 

loud music there and let the god of harmony 
ravish our sense with delightful air

in his eye possess he spirit of rage 
mufflle his understanding with black thought

even as upon these rush which thou tread 
see how her motion wind about his eye 
and do present to he her passion

madam methinks this change be better than the first 

ay if the music will not alter it 

methinks it be worse come we will have another strain 

I please let we proceed 

rival in crown and bed of king must bleed 
can that fair house contain so foul a guest 
as lust or cloak inordinate and base desire 
under so fair a coverture oh yes 
woman can blind our sense when we see best 
and set fair landscape on inconstancy 
make we blind with see the dance end 
your sin be black breach of love and friend 

now to the king blow rage till it flame hate 
a politician thrive the best in state 

Come sweet prince Philocles 
devise some new delight to shorten time 
this dulness have no relish in my sense 
it have no pith and sloth in my conceit 
be but a type of pride in best construction

I will fain hear that i'faith 

thy reason wench I pray the come disburse 

a woman fair be like a full blow rose 

which hold the fair no long than it grow 

a woman fair be like the fine gold 

which keep from use be good though never so old 

nay good lord leave a little 
she that be fair be wise and ought to know it 
for to that end do nature first bestow it 
now of this knowledge if we be not proud 
we wrong the author and we be allow 
to rank with senseless beast sith careless wed 
for want of pride detract our dignity 
now know it we know truth in the same 
not to be proud of truth ask folly name 
this lesson still be read in beauty school 
she that be fair and humble be a fool 
for neither know she how to hold her good 
or to keep safe the treasure of her blood 

a notable declamation 

nay madam by your leave 
pride give a luster to a woman fair 
thing that be high prize be ever dear 
why be the diamond the sapphire king 
but for esteem and rareness both which spring 
from the stone pride which be so chaste and hard 
nothing can pierce it itself be itself guard 
now what be pride self love our own esteem 
a strength to make we of ourselves well deem 
from whence this maxim I collect among other 
who hate herself can never love another 
and to conclude man appetite grow dull 
to what it may have empty hope be full 
to all our sex on earth maid widow wife and bride 
they happy live when they live with chaste pride 

my queen will speak as much for lust as she for pride if the toy take she 

your ladyship sow dangerous seed abroad 

but I hope my lord all ground be not fruitful 

well wench shall be the proud woman champion 

and I will defend they against all man as at single tongue 

I have rather fight with a giant than you at that weapon

against her tyrant husband that be my claim
