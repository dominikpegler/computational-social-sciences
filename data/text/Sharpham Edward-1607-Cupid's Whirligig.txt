they say Cupid be a boy yet I have know he confute the opinion of all your phylospher for they hold every light thing tend direct up but I think all know he make every light wench fall direct down well I be sure he have knock i with his bird bolt for the which Venus give he correction for I do already love a lady of a imcomparable delicacy but she be another man and will shut her ear as close to keep out charm as great man do their gate to keep in alm yet I have no reason to despair for I have kiss she and the french proverb say fame baissee est demie ioyee a woman kiss be half enjoy but I fear he mean but the upper half

I think a ill star reign when I be bear I can have as much as suitor this master Newcome that you for sooth so much scorn I can find in my heart to pray nine time to the moon and fost three saint Anne eaves so that I may be sure to have he to my husband 

ay thou will have he dream but not wake I be sure 

not wake yea and a bed too for here I vow even by the chaste thought that ere be nurse within Diana breast and by those purple drop chaste Lucrece spill and by the unstainde colour of a maiden blush that I will prove as true unto his bed as ere do she that do Ulysses wed 

nay since I have refuse a lord by this light I scorn to marry any under the degree of a knight 

no I will not have a knight if I may for there be so many as they be forget what they be 

nay I then I see you be deceive why woman they have most of they take a order that they will never be forget for they have book themselves down a purpose I know above three and twenty in one mercer book in cheap side then judge thou how many be in all their book and there be that will be a witness I warrant you to after age what their forefather have be 

ay but that be but their fault yet you know their calling be honourable though

o that be because thou be not hungry 

it be true indeed a little bit will fill my belly 

o my unkind husband why do reject i if not on thou where shall I fix my love to have reward 

here where you be in dear and high regard 

Alas thou be a man of mean condition 

your love to i will breed the less suspicion 
fortune deny i wealth all ill upon she 
yet I have courage to defend your honour 
madam you reason have to be unjust 
a wicked husband make a unkind wife 
Men brag that woman weak creature be 
yet you must suffer all gross injury 
with silence too and lowliness of spirit 
and then forsooth a good wife name your merit 
a goodly purchase sure to be a slave 
unto a slave till you go to the grave 
Eve have a soul as well as Adam 
all soul be masculine hold freedom madam 
if strength of body make the noble creature 
why shall not lion be the king of nature 
the strong creature govern be by sense 
and there thy soul have little residence 
philosopher say the element of fire 
be active pure apt to aspire 
of which you woman have the lesser portion 
which make your brain beget cold notion 
I grant that Adam be create so 
but since his fall all think do backward go 
now active heart get murder theft and rapine 
it be thy chariot which all vice do ride in 
against who ill woman can temper spurn 
give i the heart which warm not that which burn 
o hateful be the state you now do hold 
worse than the slave that be for money sell 
for you must money give to buy your evil 
and bind yourselves to some incarnate devil 
be but chief steward in their drudgery 
bring forth their brat with your life jeopardy 
Scarce dare you give a old sleeve from your arm 
but they cry out you be under Covertbaren 

presumptuous slave who flesh upon thy bone 
thy master just may challenge as his own 
which by the dead scrape from his trencher get 
be quicken now to cut thy gever throat 
thou venomed snake freeze with beggary 
now be thaw by thy master bounty 
will sting the bosom that do revive thou 
and like a viper gnaw who first conceive thou 
full argument of a servile spirit 
for noble heart will gratify each merit 

yea be you vanish 

why how now fellow slack what be she go 

s'life what shall I do now to stop this slave venomed breath for fear it infect my reputation with my new master this time be ill take yet something I must do fellow wage how long have thou be here 

ever since fortune deny thou wealth all ill upon she but thou have courage to defend her honour 

'slight he have hear all 
why man it be my master set i only to try she 

nay like enough for I see he will willing prove a accessary to the steal of his own good 

true and look here he come but I pray thou say nothing let i tell he of it 

who I not a word my mouth be as close as a faulconer pouch or a country wench placket 

she will never cuckold i but that she have some reason for it 

true sir there be nothing do but there be reason for it if a man can find it for what be the reason your citizen wife continual wear hat but to show the desire they have always to be cover or why do your sempster spend their time in prick and your lady in poke of ruff but only to show they do as they will be do unto or why do your inn of court man lie with his laundress in a long vacation but because he have no money to go abroad or why do your old judge widow always marry young gentleman but to show that they love execution better than judgement 

o but I wonder much she will not give i leave to make my first child myself 

foe she know you be but a apprentice to the occupation and common prentice spoil their first work and be unskilful she be loath you shall practise in a good shop and therefore she befriend you because she will have it well do she get a better workman to do it for you for what be the reason the young brother accord to the old wife tail always prove the wise man but because the father grow more skilful at last than they be at the first but I think your wife elder son will prove a excellent fellow because she have the help of so many in the make of it for common if one have a thing to be do as a conveyance to be draw or a case in the law to be argue a man will have the help of as many good lawyer as he can get now this case of make of child and a case in the law be something like for as one lawyer take his fee and deal in it another lawyer come and argue the case more profound but in the end when all be do leave it to be try by the jury in who the right be and so must you when they and you and all have do your best yet in the end must leave it to be try by your wife who be the child be for a woman knowledge in this case be better than twelve man 

o slack I hate worse than the worst sin that be 

and I pray which sin do you most hate 

that which be most like she which if thou will repeat 

I will tell their condition 

and I which be most like she 

then the first be pride 

I will have that sin burn for a witch it change man into so many shape 

the next be murder 

o that be a thirsty sin for nought can quench it but blood 

what be theft 

faith the great fault that I can find in that be it cozen the scrivener for it borrow money without give any obligation 

covetousness 

o that be a excellent sin for to deal with a that have a loose belly for it will bind any man for ten groat 

what be sloth then 

faith sloth be a good maidenly greensickness sin 

but lechery my lady 

o that be the suck sin that a man can be acquaint withal it can endure to be in company it creep into corner and hide itself in the dark still 

what say then to drunkenness 

o that be a most gentleman like sin it scorn to be behold for what it receive in a man house it common leave it again at his door 

nay than lechery scorn to be behold too for I have know what it have receive in a man house it have send home again nine month after and lie at his door and therefore the more gentleman like sin a great deal because it take the long time of repayment but I pray sit now which of all this be most like your wife 

murder for nought can quench her thirst of lust but now I soon shall find her villainy praise be my vigilant care which if I do espy I will turn she off 

Alas alas sir you have no reason to be angry much less to be divorce although she do transgress be you not cut have you not give her cause be it not out of mere necessity she do it therefore if you follow my counsel make her amends with kindness and put not her away 

believe i he speak wise and good counsel like a lady be to be embrace 

not put she away and if she wrong he if he do not I say he be one of the arrant block that ever man spurn on why be he not a gentleman a knight have he not see fashion sir I will have you bear a noble mind put she away and you list it be no matter for cause if she change but a trencher with the groom of your stable it be deal enough to be divorce therefore put she away and than you may have another wife 

another wife 

true a gallant and yet a modest lady too one that shall nourish no blood but your own tender your reputation as the apple of her eye and honour even your very footstep 

she shall go I will make she truss up her trinket o faith she shall away 

shall she away if she do you do you know not what you draw a thousand thousand enemy about your ear her kindred they will exclaim no friend will seek revenge and your enemy will grow even fat with laughter at your folly beside what woman then will have you be you not geld assure yourself that now there be none will love you most will hate you but all will scorn you therefore by my advice make much of she and keep she while you have she 

hah now by the virtue of my hear he speak but reason 

So it be good to keep she still dwell in the suburb to break down your own glass window set some pick upon your hatch and I pray profess to keep a bawdyhouse 

a bawdyhouse no I will die first and if I see but any apparent show of her disloyalty I will even be divorce immediate 

well I see the substance of this slave be villainy 
but I will prevent he even what I can 
since none be worse than a serve honest man 

why have I not a good leg do I not always wear clean line be not my hand wash my beard comb my cloak brush and my shoe black every morning 

true why the more vile strumpet she to cuckold you 

but how do know she be with child 

know it why she be daily trouble with water pang and quake over her stomach 

indeed I must needs say that be a great proof she have fill her belly with something that stand against her stomach but do not think it be my child 

you why how can it be you be you not circumcise to the quick 

yes and the remembrance of it gall i 

that be a sign you be too patient and like a ass endure all without resistance 

ha ha ha 

but why do you laugh sir 

to think who the child will be like 

why you who shall it be like else 

why it be none of my man 

why the more like you for that why do you not not know the philosopher hold the child be always like the party which the mother think off in the conception now she think most of you for fear you shall have come the while and that be the reason so many gentleman son be like your citizen and call they father too for otherwise how can it be that a young cockney be leave forty or fiftiie thousand pound spend all within so many month but that some young gallant beget he for you know the prover be cat will after kind no have the old citizen beget he he will a bit a fig in two to have make just weight and have have a pot with a false bottom rather than a sell too much measure he will have do all thing within measure as your old citizen do and not a spend all beyond measure as your young gallant do 

but be not I best go home and use she well till the child be bear to see if it be like i that I may be sure it be none of i 

o no that be base and as deceitful as the colic when it break out in wind which level at a man heel and it strike he in the nose therefore never make a show of one thing and do another but put she away rid your hand of she and there be a end 

I think who be the father of the bastard 

why who be the father of a punk child be it not filius populi it may have two father for any thing we know 

well slack I do very much mistrust wage too for he be grow very familiar of late 

true sir and take her part too and you mark he 

I mark he no slack no pray heaven a mark not i but I will instant sue out a divorce hap what hap shall but ill be his hap who wife lie down to all 

of all honest animal your cuckold be the best 
for he be sure a gentleman and know by his crest 

of all occupation that ever man profess 
in my opinion still do hold the cutpurse be the best 

and why the cutpurse 

because he will trust no man foe as soon as he have loan his work he be sure to have his money in his hand 

nay then a lawyer be a better trade than that for he be sure of his money before he do his work 

but I pray thou what be the news abroad now 

why they say the world be like a bias bowl and it run all on the rich man side other say it be like a tennisball and fortune keep such a racket with it as it toss it in to time hazard and that devour all and for my part they say it will short run upon wheel with i for my master swear a will have i cart because he think I have lie with my lady 

nay then it will run upon wheel with thou indeed but peace fool peace when thou be once marry that suspect will die 

peace fool peace say thou when I be marry do hear I tell thou there be no piece in marriage unless it be with a dumb woman no nor but little comfort neither 

no way why do the ballad say then so sweet a thing be love that rule both heart and mind there be no comfort in the world to woman that be blind 

kind man the ballet say 

mass I think a be kind indeed yet blind the better of the two I think for as thou say if she be dumb I be sure she will say nothing that shall offend her husband if blind she will see nothing that shall offend she and where he nor she be offend there must needs be a peace but beside this be there no peace think thou in the marriage of a wife 

yes by the man side like a gentleman only by the father side but it will never be any perfect peace 

why why will thou marry then 

because I hope to have some good behaviour of my wife for the peace I never look for but soft ye fellow slack methinks your suit be like a hard heart landlord it begin to receive great rent 

ay I will my master have give i a suit of buff when he give i this 

Phoe buff be nought man that have be out of request quest ever since soldier have be out of date and they poor man be now use like almanac of the last year either clapup behind the door or thrust clean out of door but if thou will have a suit that shall last indeed lad get thou a suit of law 

o I do not like such suit for common they that have many of they go almost naked for want of clothes yet I can deny but they be very last but they be subject to many discommodity so if there be any goodness in one of they your lawyer like moth eat shrewd hole to it but your country attorney like louse never leave wright and wrangle till they have creep into it but when it have be well wear and grow thread bare they even like louse drop off and leave it 

what say thou by a suit at court then 

I marry sir I like that well for common he that have but one suit when he come there have two ere he come away for if he sue by petition it lie so long in your courtier pocket that it be another suit to get his petition back again there be none sudden dispatch of his suit there but a tailor marry he stay not at all unless his suit be to have money for his suit and so he make his suit two suit too ere he go but come shall we go see what follow after our master new divorce 

why be a divorce 

ay I think by this time for he swear he will be present by my troth I be sorry for it for in my conscience it be without cause it grieve i to see he in these humour for I thank his worship he have ever use i well I be bind to pray for his life 

and methinks that be a strange thing I see no reason for it that any servingman shall pray for his master life consider all that he have be in reversion of he but come let we follow he for if he miss we he will fret like a grogram I and fume like a stew pot 

and let he fume oh will his gall will burst with indignation then shall his temper procreate my bliss and I enjoy that saint incarnate but what shall I do since base nor noble shape can win a three I will try 
and if that fail knight go to church and pray 
for vengeance wing bring on thy lethal day 

he that a long way voyage take in hand fear dangerous gust at sea and storm 
at land conquer cold that cripple curse age and doubt lest every cloud shall prove a storm and beat his weary carcase to the earth but oh I will to God my long journey unto death be to be take for I do cast no doubt have lose all comfort my son I fear be dead the loss of he make life to i but like a blister on my flesh which grieve i much and nought can ease unless it break o while he live his presence be a force unto my age and give it such a luster as do enrich my ring of life for life be but a ring beginning in our weakness go round till unto weakness we return again then to the ground the world itself be but a skilful game at chess which be end king and queen bishop and knight into one bag be throw at last so all of we both poor and rich shall in the end into the earth as into a bag be castman life be like unto a ship that cross by tempest and by tide some thought of his like billow swell he up aloft another strike he down thus man as on a sea be toss in fair weather fear a storm and in a storm the event but in the end he sink when life be spend grief have no bound in tear it ebb and flow 
till it have drown life and end woe 

but wage be there no mean think thou to turn by it nor to force back his stream of wrath 

yes I will warrant you madam if you will be rule by i you shall see I will make he seek to be friend with you and entreat i to speak for he too but then I will have you seem a little strange but you shall direct rail on he therefore I will have you hide yourselves here behind the hang for it will not be long ere he come this way and than you shall come forth and frame your behaviour accord as our discourse shall require

thou need not love speak what thou will if gentle thou do speak thy word to i be much more musical than be a siren voice Orpheus himself can never strain his high stretch string to such melodious sound as when thy voice do pierce the ear 

it be but for my wit she love i I send her trick already for courtier must aswell thrive be have nose to smell out as eye to see 

despise and leave alone fill brim full of grief and no way to unload i of my care 
but through these run eye in stream of tear 

who tear like to a clear yet poison source have with their vapour through these eye the window to my heart infect all my thought thy eye do shoot forth glance like to star though seat in a moist and rainy sky the which have wound even my heart and I must die lest Achilles lancelike heal by your eye

and as of they you see neither 
so none of these can overtake either 
and though you see they thus forsake 
they shall be marry but mistake 
which for performance yet a while 
I must be labour to beguile 
only the man and make they venture 
to run a circle far from centre 
of their hope yet for their good 
where blind each like hawk in hood 
shall marry better than they woo 

nay madam it must needs be so or else the priest will never marry i 

and so you will have we all be marry mask 

true to which you all may easy persuade your lover tell they with my marriage will be with much the less suspect effect

for this be hold a principle in school 
love make not fool wise man but wise man fool
