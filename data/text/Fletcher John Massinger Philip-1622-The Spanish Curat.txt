LEandro pay all 

it be his usual custom 
and requisite he shall he have now put off 
the funeral black your rich heir wear with joy 
when he pretend to weep for his dead father 
your gather sire so long heap muck together 
that their kind son to rid they of their care 
wish they in heaven or if they take a taste 
of purgatory by the way it matter not 
provide they remove hence what be befall 
to his father in the other world I ask not 
I be sure his prayer be hear will I can use one 
for i in the same method 

fie upon thou 
this be profane 

good doctor do not school i 
for a fault you be not free from on my life 
be all heir in Corduba put too their oath 
they will confess with i it be a sound tenet 
I be sure Leandro do it 

he be the owner 
of a fair estate 

and fair he deserve it 
he be a royal fellow yet observe a mean 
in all his course careful to on who 
he shower his bounty he that be liberal 
to all alike may do a good by chance 
but never out of judgement This invite 
the prime man of the city to frequent 
all place he resort to and be happy 
in his sweet converse 

don Jamie the brother 
to the grandee don Henrique appear much take 
with his behaviour 

there be something more in it 
he need his purse and know how to make use on it 
it be now in fashion for your don that be poor 
to vow all league of friendship with a merchant 
that can supply his want and howsoever 
don jamie noble bear his elder brother 
don Henrique rich and his revenue long since 
increase by marry with a wealthy heir 
call madam Violante he yet hold 
a hard hand over Jamie allow he 
a bare annuity only 

yet it be say 
he have no child and by the law of Spain 
if he die without issue don jamie 
inherit his estate 

why that be the reason 
of their so many jar though the young lord 
be sick of the elder brother and in reason 
shall flatter and observe he he be of a nature 
too bold and fierce to stoop so but bear up 
presume on his hope 

what be the young lad 
that all of they make so much of 

it be a sweetone 
and the best condition youth I ever see yet 
so humble and so affable that he win 
the love of all that know he and so modest 
that in despite of poverty he will starve 
rather than ask a courtesy he be the son 
of a poor castcaptain one Octavio 
and she that once be call the fair jacinta 
be happy in be his mother for his sake 
though in their fortune fall they be esteem of 
and cherish by the best o here they come 
I now may spare his character but observe he 
he will justify my report 

my good Ascanio 
repair more often to i above woman 
thou ever shall be welcome 

my lord your favour 
may quick teach a raw untutored youth 
to be both rude and saucy 

you can be 
too frequent where you be so much desire 
and give i leave dear friend to be your rival 
in part of his affection I will buy it 
at any rate 

stand I but now possess 
of what my future hope presage to i 
I then will make it clear thou have a patron 
that will not say but do yet as I be 
be my I will not receive thou as a servant 
but as my son and though I want myself 
no page attend in the court of Spain 
shall find a kind master 

I beseech you 
that my refusal of so great a offer 
may make no ill construction it be not pride 
that common vice be far from my condition 
that make you a denial to receive 
a favour I shall sue for nor the fashion 
which the country follow in which to be a servant 
in those that groan beneath the heavy weight 
of poverty be hold a argument 
of a base and abject mind I wish my year 
be fit to do you service in a nature 
that may become a gentleman give i leave 
to think myself one my father serve the king 
as a captain in the field and though his fortune 
return he home a poor man he be rich 
in reputation and wound fair take 
nor be I by his ill success deter 
I rather feel a strong desire that sway i 
to follow his profession and if heaven 
have mark i out to be a man how proud 
in the service of my country shall I be 
to trail a pike under your brave command 
there I will follow you as a guide to honour 
though all the horror of the war make up 
to stop my passage 

thou be a hopeful boy 
and it be brave speak for this answer 
I love thou more than ever 

pity such seed 
of promise courage shall not grow and prosper 

whatever his repute parent be 
he have a mind that speak he right and noble 

you make he blush it need not sweet Ascanio 
we may hear praise when they be deserve 
or modesty unwounded by my life 
I will add something to the build up 
so fair a mind and if till you be fit 
to bear arm in the field you will spend some year 
in Salamanca I will supply your study 
with all convenience 

your goodness signior 
and charitable favour overwhelm i 
if I be of your blood you can not be 
more tender of i what then can I pay 
a poor boy and a stranger but a heart 
bind to your service with what willingness 
I will receive good sir your noble offer 
heaven can bear witness for i but alas 
shall I embrace the mean to raise my fortune 
I must destroy the life of my poor parent 
to who I owe my be they in i 
place all their comfort and as if I be 
the light of their dim eye be so indulgent 
they can brook one short day absence from i 
and what will hardly win belief though young 
I be their steward and their nurse the bounty 
which other bestow on i serve to sustain they 
and to forsake they in their age in i 
be more than murder 

this be a kind of beg 
will make a broker charitable 

here sweet heart 
I wish that it be more 

when this be spend 
seek for supply from i 

thy piety 
for ever be remember nay take all 
though it be my exhibition to a royal 
for one whole year 

high heaven reward your goodness 

so sir be this a slip of your own graft 
you be so prodigal 

a slip sir

I shall forget your birth if you proceed 
and use you as your manner do deserve uncivil 

so brave pray you give i hear 
who be I sir 

my elder brother one 
that may have be bear a fool and so repute 
but that you have the luck to creep into 
the world a year before i 

be more temperate 

I neither can nor will unless I learn it 
by this example let he use his harsh 
unsavoury reprehension upon those 
that be his hind and not on i the land 
our father leave to he alone reward he 
for be twelve month elder let that be 
forget and let his parasite remember 
one quality of worth or virtue in he 
that may authorise he to be a censurer 
of i or of my manner and I will 
acknowledge he for a tutor till then never 

from who have you your mean sir 

from the will 
of my dead father I be sure I spend not 
nor give it upon your purse 

but will it hold out 
without my help 

I be sure it shall I will sink else 
for soon I will seek aid from a whore 
than a courtesy from you 

it be well you be proud of 
your new exchequer when you have cheat he 
and wear he to the quick I may be find 
in the list of your acquaintance 

pray you hold 
and give i leave my lord to say thus much 
and in my own defence I be no gull 
to be wrought on by persuasion nor no coward 
to be beat out of my mean but know to who 
and why I give or lend and will do nothing 
but what my reason warrant you may be 
as spare as you please I must be bold 
to make use of my own without your licence 

pray thou let he alone he be not worth thy anger 
all that he do Leandro be for my good 
I think there be not a gentleman of Spain 
that have a better steward than I have of he 

your steward sir 

yes and a provident one 
why he know I be give to large expense 
and therefore lay up for i can you believe else 
that he that sixteen year have wear the yoke 
of barren wedlock without hope of issue 
his coffer vbz full his land and vineyard fruitful 
can be so sell to base and sordid thrift 
as almost to deny himself the mean 
and necessary of life Alas he know 
the law of Spain appoint i for his heir 
that all must come to i if I outlive he 
which sure I must do by the course of nature 
and the assistance of good mirth and sack 
however you prove melancholy 

if I live 
thou dear shall repent this 

when thou be dead 
I be sure I shall not 

now they begin to burn 
like oppose meteor 

give they line and way 
my life for don Jamie 

continue still 
the excellent husband and join farm to farm 
suffer no lordship that in a clear day 
fall in the prospect of your covetous eye 
to be another forget you be a grandee 
take use upon use and cut the throat of heir 
with cozen mortgage rack your poor tenant 
till they look like so many skeleton 
for want of food and when that widow curse 
the ruin of ancient family tear of orphan 
have hurry you to the devil ever remember 
all be rake up for i your thankful brother 
that will dance merry upon your grave 
and perhaps give a double pistolet 
to some poor needy friar to say a mass 
to keep your ghost from walk 

that the law 
shall force i to endure this 

very 
when this shall come to pass as sure it will 
if you can find a loophole though in hell 
to look on my behaviour you shall see i 
ransack your iron chest and once again 
Pluto flamecoloured daughter shall be free 
to domineer in tavern mask and revel 
as she be use before she be your captive 
methinks the mere conceit of it shall make you 
go home sick and distemper if it do 
I will send you a doctor of my own and after 
take order for your funeral

now he be from my eye I can be merry 
forget the cause and he all plague go with he 
let we talk of something else what news be stir 
nothing to pass the time 

i'faith it be say 
that the next summer will determine much 
of that we long have talk of touch the war 

what have we to do with they let we discourse 
of what concern ourselves it be now in fashion 
to have you gallant set down in a tavern 
what the archduke purpose be the next spring and what 
defence my lord the state prepare what course 
the emperor take against the encroach Turk 
and whither his moonystandard be design 
for Persia or Polonia and all this 
the wise sort of stateworm seem to know 
better than their own affair this be discourse 
fit for the counsel it concern we be young 
and if that I may give the theme it be better 
to talk of handsome woman 

and that be one 
almost as general 

yet none agree 
who be the fair 

some prefer the french 
for their conceited dress some the plump 
italian bonaroba some the state 
that we observe and I have hear one swear 
a merry friend of i that once in London 
he do enjoy the company of a gamester 
a common gamester too that in one night 
meet he the Italian french and spanish way 
and end in the dutch for to cool herself 
she kiss he drink in the morning 

we may spare 
the travel of our tongue in foreign nation 
when in Corduba if you dare give credit 
to my report for I have see she gallant 
there live a woman of a mean birth too 
and mean match who allexcelling form 
disdain comparison with any she 
that put in for a fair one and though you borrow 
from every country of the earth the best 
of those perfection which the climate yield 
to help to make she up if put in balance 
this will weighdowne the scale 

you talk of wonder 

she be indeed a wonder and so keep 
and as the world deserve not to behold 
what curious nature make without a pattern 
who copy she have lose too she be shut up 
sequester from the world 

who be the owner 
of such a gem I be fire 

one Bartolus 
a wrangle advocate 

a knave on record 

I be sure he cheat i of the best part 
of my estate 

some business call i hence 
and of importance which deny i leisure 
to give you his full character in few word 
though rich he be covetous beyond expression 
and to increase his heap will dare the devil 
and all the plague of darkness and to these 
so jealous as if you will parallel 
old Argus to he you must multiply 
his eye a hundred time of these none sleep 
he that will charm the heavy lid must hire 
a better Mercury than jove make use of 
bless yourselves from the thought of he and she 
for it will be labour lose so farewell signior exit 

Leandro in a dream wake man for shame 

train into a fool paradise with a tale 
of a imagine form 

jamie be noble 
and with a forge tale will not wrong his friend 
nor be I so much fire with lust as envy 
that such a churl as Bartolus shall reap 
so sweet a harvest half my state to any 
to help i to a share 

tush do not hope for 
impossibility 

I must enjoy she 
and my prophetic love tell i I shall 
lend i but your assistance

expect to be the subject of our laughter exeunt 

you meet don Henrique 

yes 

what comfort bring you 
speak cheerful how do my letter work 
on his hard temper I be sure I write it 
so feel and with the pen of sorrow 
that it must force compunction 

you be cozen 
can you with one hand prop a fall tower 
or with the other stop the rage main 
when it break in on the usurp shore 
or any thing that be impossible 
and then conclude that there be some way leave 
to move he to compassion 

be there a justice 
or thunder my Octavio and he 
not sink unto the centre 

good jacinta 
with your long practise patience bear affliction 
and by provoke it call not on heaven anger 
he do not only scorn to read your letter 
but most inhuman as he be he curse you 
curse you most bitter 

the bad man charity 
o that I can forget there be a tie 
in i upon he or the relief I seek 
if give be bounty in he and not debt 
debt of a dear account 

touch not that string 
it will but increase our sorrow and tame silence 
the balm of the oppress which hitherto 
have ease your grieve soul and preserve your fame 
must be your surgeon still 

if the contagion 
of my misfortune have not spread itself 
upon my son Ascanio though my want 
be centuply upon my self I can be patient 
but he be so good I so miserable 
his pious care his duty and obedience 
and all that can be wish for from a son 
discharge to i and I bard of all mean 
to return any scruple of the debt 
I owe he as a mother be a torment 
too painful to be bear 

I suffer with you 
in that yet find in this assurance comfort 
high heaven ordain who purpose can alter 
child that pay obedience to their parent 
shall never beg their bread 

here come our joy 
where have my dear be 

I have make mother 
a fortunate voyage and bring home rich prize 
in a few hour the owner too content 
from who I take it see here be gold good store too 
nay pray you take it 

man charity be so cold 
that if I know not thou be make of goodness 
it will breed a jealousy in i by what mean 
thou come by such a sum 

be it ill get 
I be sure it can not be employ so well 
as to relieve your want some noble friend 
raise by heaven mercy to i not my merit 
bestow it on i 

it be a sacrilege 
to rob thou of their bounty since they give it 
to thy use only 

buy thou brave clothes with it 
and fit thou for a fortune and leave we 
to our necessity why do thou weep 

out of my fear I have offend you 
for have I not I be sure you be too kind 
not to accept the offer of my service 
in which I be a gainer I have hear 
my tutor say of all a aerial foul 
the stork be the emblem of true piety 
because when age have seize upon her dam 
and make unfit for flight the grateful young one 
take she upon his back provide her food 
repay so her tender care of he 
ere he be fit to fly by bear she 
shall I then that have reason and discourse 
that tell i all I can do be too little 
be more unnatural than a silly bird 
or feed or clothe myself superfluous 
and know nay see you want holy saint keep i 

can I be wretched 
and know myself the mother to such goodness 

Come let we dry our eye we will have a feast 
thank to our little steward 

and in he 
believe that we be rich 

I be sure I be 
while I have power to comfort you and serve you 

be it my fault don Henrique or my fate 
what be my offence I come young to your bed 
I have a fruitful mother and you meet i 
with equal ardour in your may of blood 
and why then be I barren 

it be not in man 
to yield a reason for the will of heaven 
which be inscrutable 

to what use serve 
full fortune and the mean sort of blessing 
when that which be the crown of all our wish 
the period of humane happiness 
one only child that may possess what be we 
be cruel deny we 

it be the curse 
of great estate to want those pledge which 
the poor be happy in they in a cottage 
with joy behold the model of their youth 
and as their root decay those bud branch 
sprout forth and flourish to renew their age 
but this be the beginning not the end 
to i of that misery against my will 
since heaven deny we issue of our own 
must leave the fruit of all my care and travel 
to a unthankful brother that insult 
on my calamity 

I will rather choose 
a bastard from the hospital and adopt he 
and nourish he as my own 

such a evasion 
my Violante be forbid to we 
happy the roman state where it be lawful 
if our own son be vicious to choose one 
out of a virtuous stock though of poor parent 
and make he noble but the law of Spain 
intend to preserve all ancient house 
prevent such free election with this my brother 
too well acquaint and this make he bold to 
reign over i as a master 

I will fire 
the portion I bring with i ere he spend 
a royal of it no quirk leave no quiddit 
that may defeat he 

be I but confirm 
that you will take the mean I use with patience 
as I must practise it with my dishonour 
I can lay level with the earth his hope 
that soar above the cloud with expectation 
to see i to my grave 

effect but this 
and our revenge shall be to we a son 
that shall inherit for we 

do not repent 
when it be too late 

I fear not what may fall 
he dispossess that do usurp on all exeunt 

can any thing but wonder 

wonder on 
I be as you see and what will follow gentleman 

why do thou put on this form what can this do 
thou look most silly 

like a young clerk 
a half pin'dpuppy that will write for a royal 
be this a command shape to win a beauty 
to what use what occasion 

peace you be fool 
more silly than my outside seem you be ignorant 
they that pretend to wonder must weave cunning 

what manner of access can this get or if get 
what credit in her eye 

will you but leave i 

methinks a young man and a handsome gentleman 
but sure thou be lunatic methinks a brave man 
that will catch cunning the beam of beauty 
and so distribute they unto his comfort 
shall like himself appear young high and buxom 
and in the bright form 

you be cozen gentleman 
neither do I believe this nor will follow it 
thus I be I will begin my voyage 
when you love launch it out in silk and velvet 
I le love in serge and will outgo our satin 
to get upon my great horse and appear

one that not long since be the buckram scribe 
that will run on man errand for a Aspe● 
and from such baseness have raise a stock 
to bribe the covetous judge call to the bar 
so poor in practice too that you will plead 
a needy client cause for a starve hen 
or half a little loin of veal though fly blow 
and these the great fee you can arrive at 
for just proceed but since you turn rascal 

good word my lord 

And grow my brother bawd 
in all his vicious course soothe he 
in his dishonest practise you be grow 
the rich and eminent knave in the devil name 
what be I cite for

or I will miss of my end 

be it not in court

snatch from poor client mouth into a jelly 
I will my man of law but I be patient 
and will obey the judge

it be session purchase at our suit don Henrique 
have bring we hither to hear and determine 
of what you can prefer 

I do beseech 
the honourable court I may be hear 
in my advocate 

it be grant 

humh humh 

that preface 
if leave out in a lawyer spoil the cause 
though never so good and honest 

if I stand here 
to plead in the defence of a ill man 
most equal judge or to accuse the innocent 
to both which I profess myself a stranger 
it will be requisite I shall deck my language 
with trope and figure and all flourish 
that grace a Rhetorician it be confess 
adulterate metal need the goldsmith art 
to set they off what in itself be perfect 
contemn a borrow gloss this lord my client 
who honest cause when it be relate true 
will challenge justice find in his conscience 
a tender scruple of a fault long since 
by he commit think it not sufficient 
to be absolve of it by his confessor 
if that in open court he publish nor 
what be so long conceal 

to what tend this 

in his young year it be no miracle 
that youth and heat of blood shall mix together 
he look upon this woman on who face 
the ruin yet remain of excellent form 
he look on she and love she 

you good angel 
what a impudence be this 

And use all mean 
of service courtship present that may win she 
to be at his devotion but in vain 
her maiden fort impregnable hold out 
until he promise marriage and before 
these witness a solemn contract pass 
to take she as his wife 

give they their oath 

they be incompetent witness his own creature 
and will swear any thing for half a royal 

silence 

proceed 

upon this strong assurance 
he do enjoy his wish to the full 
which satisfy and then with eye of judgement 
have wink with lust before consider due 
the inequality of the match he be 
noble descend and ally but she 
without a name or family secret 
he purchase a divorce to disannul 
his former contract marry open 
the lady Violante 

as you sit here 
the deputy of the great king who be 
the substitute of that impartial judge 
with who or wealth or title prevail nothing 
grant to a much wrong widow or a wife 
your patience with liberty to speak 
in her own cause and let i face to face 
to this bad man deliver what he be 
and if my wrong with his ingratitude balance 
move not compassion let i die unpitied 
his tear his oath his perjury I pass over 
to think of they be a disease but death 
shall I repeat they I dare not deny 
for innocence can justify what be false 
but all the advocate have allege concern 
his falsehood and my shame in my consent 
to be most true but now I turn to thou 
to thou don Henrique and if impious act 
have leave thou blood enough to make a blush 
I will paint it on thy cheek be not the wrong 
sufficient to defeat i of my honour 
to leave i full of sorrow as of want 
the witness of thy lust leave in my womb 
to testify thy falsehood and my shame 
but now so many year I have conceal 
thy most inhuman wickedness and win 
this gentleman to hide it from the world 
to father what be thy for yet by heaven 
though in the city he pass for my husband 
he never know i as his wife 

it be strange 
give he a oath 

I glad swear and true 

after all this I say when I have bear 
these wrong with saintlike patience see another 
free enjoy what be in justice mine 
yet still so tender of thy rest and quiet 
I never will divulge it to disturb 
thy peace at home yet thou most barbarous 
to be so careless of i and my fame 
for all respect of thou in the first step 
to thy base lust be lose in open court chessboard and man set ready 
to publish my disgrace and on record 
to write i up a easyyielding wanton 
I think can find no precedent in my extreme 
one comfort yet be leave that though the law 
divorce i from thy bed and make free way 
to the unjust embrace of another 
it can yet deny that this thy son 
look up Ascanio since it be come out 
be thy legitimate heir 

confederacy 
a trick my lord to cheat i ere you give 
your sentence grant i hear 

new chimaera 

I be my lord since he be without issue 
or hope of any his undoubted heir 
and this forge by the advocate to defeat i 
of what the law of Spain confer upon i 
a mere imposture and conspiracy 
against my future fortune 

you be too bold 
speak to the cause don Henrique 

I confess 
though the acknowledgement must wound my honour 
that all the court have hear touch this cause 
or with i or against i be most true 
the late part my brother urge except 
for what I now do be not out of spleen 
as he pretend but from remorse of conscience 
and to repair the wrong that I have do 
to this poor woman and I beseech your lordship 
to think I have not so far lose my reason 
to bring into my family to succeed i 
the stranger issue of another bed 
by proof this be my son I challenge he 
accept he and acknowledge he and desire 
by a definitive sentence of the court 
he may be so record and full power 
to i to take he home 

a second rape 
to the poor remnant of content that be left i 
if this be grant and all my former wrong 
be but beginning to my misery 
but this the height of all rather than part 
with my Ascanio I will deny my oath 
profess myself a strumpet and endure 
what punishment soever the court decree 
against a wretch that have forswear herself 
or play the impudent whore 

This taste of passion 
and that must not divert the course of justice 
don Henrique take your son with this condition 
you give he maintenance as become his birth 
and it will stand with your honour to do something 
for this wrong woman I will compel nothing
