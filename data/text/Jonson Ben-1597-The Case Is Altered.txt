not at eleven and six so if your humour 
be now affect with this heaviness 
give i the reins and spare not as I do 
in this my pleasurable appetite 
it be precisianism to alter that 
with austere judgement that be give by nature 
I weep you see too when my mother die 
for then I find it easy to do so 
and fit with my mood than not to weep 
but now it be otherwise another time 
perhaps I shall have such deep thought of she 
that I shall weep afresh some twelvemonth hence 
and I will weep if I be so dispose 
and put on black as grim then as now 
let the mind go still with the body stature 
judgement be fit for judge give i nature

but you that temper they so well with virtue 
use your grief so it will prove they pleasure 
and you will seem in cause of grief and pleasure equal pleasant

divine and sacred contemplation 
of that eternal and most glorious bliss
