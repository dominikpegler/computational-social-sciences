stony and hard to work yet time and honour 
shall find and bring forth that that be rich and worthy 

I will try that and to the purpose you tell i sir 
in noble emulation so I take it 
I will put your hatred far off and forget it

and teach my sword to hurt that that preserve i 
though I be rough by nature shall my name 
inherit that eternal stain of barbarous 
give i a enemy a thing that hate you 
that never hear of yet nor feel your goodness

oh noble Pedro let we feel they right 
and right but consider how they move we 

be not their honour we

and then the sword add nothing to their lustre 
but rather call in question what be not doubt 
if they be not the best sword and best valour 
can never fight they up to fame again

how brave now he be temper I must fight 
and rather make it honourable then angry

and in a noble mind so low and loose 
to look back and collect such lump and lick they 
into new horrid form again

than if I have a woman in my cause sir 
and more proclaim i fool yet I must confess 
I have be covetous of all occasion 
and this I have take upon trust for noble 
the more shame i devise a way to fight thus 
that like the wound air no blood may issue

and set i on I will not scar that body 
that virtuous valiant body nor deface it

the misery we have suffer by these outlaw 
the loss hourly fear the rude abuse 
stranger that travel to we be daily load with 
our daughter and our wife complaint

will ask some bloody crown I know his people 
be of his own choice man that will not totter 
nor blench much at a bullet I know his order 
and though he have no multitude he have manhood 
the eldertwin to that too staid experience 
but if he must be force sir 

there be no remedy 
unless he come himself 

that will be doubtful 
do you never hear yet of the noble Pedro 

I can by no mean I think he be dead sure 
the court bewail much his untimely loss 
the king himself lament he 

he be sink 
and if he be dead he die happy
