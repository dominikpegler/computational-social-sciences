a creature of much sweetness if all tongue

what if she shall 
renew the bond of her devotion

or that he may be tenant to some whale 
within who belly he may practise lent 
and feed on fish till he be vomit 
upon some coast or have escape the sea 
and bill of exchange fail he may purpose 
to foot it over the Alps in his return 
and by mischance be fall among the mouse 
with who perhaps he batten upon sleep 
beneath the snow

I know not what to think or be she not the worse for the coy lady that live with she 

her kinswoman

of all posterity to beat their husband 

how you endear your servant 

I will not 
be guilty of more stay 

sweet lady 

you be come in time sir to redeem i

so uncivil to affront you 

I have no patience to hear he long 
take his offence before you question he 

and be most happy if by any service 
you teach i to deserve your fair opinion 

it be not civil to eavesdrop he but 
I be sure he talk on it now 

of what 

of love be any thing more ridiculous 
you know I never cherish that condition 
in you it be the most harsh unpleasing discord 
but I hope you will be instruct better 
know how much my fancy go against it 
talk not of that and welcome 

you retain 
I see your unkind temper will no thought 
soften your heart disdain agree but ill 
with so much beauty if you will persuade 
i not to love you strive to be less fair 
undo that face and so become a rebel 
to heaven and nature 

you do love my face then 

as heavenly prologue to your mind I do not 
dote like Pygmalion on the colour 

no you can he be a paint mistress 
or if it be the mind you so pretend 
to affect you increase my wonder of your folly 
for I have tell you that so often 

what 

my mind so opposite to all your courtship 
that I have rather hear the tedious tale 
of Holinshed than any thing that trench 
on love if you come fraught with any 
Cupid devise keep they for his whirligig 
or land the next edition of his messenger 
or post with a mad packet I shall but 
laugh at they and pity you 

that pity 

do not mistake i it shall be a very 
miserable pity without love 
be I a man and have but half that handsomeness 
for though I have not love I hate detraction 
ere I will put my invention to the sweat 
of compliment to court my mistress hand 
and call she smile blessing beyond a sun beam 
entreat to wait upon she give her ring 
with wanton or most lamentable poesy 
I will turn thrasher

from woman 

I will concern your peace to have some faith in it 

you will not be neglect

yourselves the nobleness of your birth and nature 
by servile flattery of this jig 
and that coy mistress keep your privilege

be there 
so great a happiness in nature 

there be one 
just a your mind can there be such happiness 
in nature fie upon it if it be possible 
that ever I shall be so mad to love 
to which I thank my star I be not incline 
I shall not hold such servant worth my garter 
though they will put i in security 
to hang themselves and ease i of their visit 

you be a strange gentlewoman why look you lady 
I be not so enchant with your virtue 
but I do know myself and at what distance 
to look upon such mistress

many confusion and fine curse by it

none that have eye will follow the direction 
of a blind guide and what do you thing of Cupid 
woman be either fool or very wise

not worth your love and if a woman know 
how to be wise she will care for you 

do you give all this council without a fee 
Come be less wild I know you can be 
so hard of soul

show you a paper that will make you bleed 
to see his resolution and what 
strange and unimitable way he have 
vow to pursue I tremble to think on they

pity the fall of such a goodly pile 
but will not spare from their superfluous wealth 
to be the benefactor

that empty wish be their shame that have 
ability to do a noble work 
and fly the action 

Come you may apply it 
I will not have you a gentlewoman of your word 
alone they be deed that crown all what you wish I 
be in your own ability to give

than forfeit they so poor he be true 
noble and best justify his blood 
when he can number the descent of virtue 

you will not degrade i 

it be not in my power 
or will my lord and yet you press i strange 
as you be a person separate and distinct 
by your high blood above i and my fortune 
thus low I bend you have no noble title 
which I not bow to they be character 
which we shall read at distance and there be 
not one that shall with more devotion 
and honour of your birth express her service

example too of goodness they which teach 
their knee a compliment will give their heart

most proud to serve your lordship and will refuse

as much above you in my innocence 

This become not

I ever take to speak myself I have 
be bold in the comparison but find not 
wherein I have wrong virtue plead for it 

how long will you continue thus

I find not desire to sleep and I be abed we 

it be not improbable my lord but you

a seat among the grave nobility 
when your cold blood shall starve your wanton thought 
and your slow pulse beat like your body knell

will it be any comfort to remember 
the sin of your wild youth how many wife 
or virgin you have dishonour in their number
