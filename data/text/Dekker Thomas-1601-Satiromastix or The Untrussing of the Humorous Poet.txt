to see my fate that when I dip my pen 
in distil rose and do strive to drain 
out of my ink all gall that when I weigh 
each syllable I write or speak because 
my enemy with sharp and search eye 
look through and through i carve my poor labour 
like a anatomy o heaven to see 
that when my line be measure out as straight 
as even parallel it be strange that still 
still some imagine they be draw away 
the error be not i but in their eye 
that can take proportion 

Horace Horace 
to stand within the shot of gall tongue 
prove not your gilt for can we write on paper 
make of these turn leaf of heaven the cloud 
or speak with angel tongue yet wise man know 
that some will shake the head though saint shall sing 
some snake must hiss because they reborne with sting 

it be true 

do we not see fool laugh in heaven and mock 
the maker workmanship be not you grieve 
if that which you mould fair upright and smooth 
be screw a wry make crooked lame and vile 
by rack comment and calumnious tongue 
so to be bite it rankle not for innocence 
may with a feather brush off the foul wrong 
but when your dastard wit will strike at man 
in corner and in riddle fold the vice 
of your best friend you must not take to heart 
if they take off all gild from their pill 
and only offer you the bitter core 

Crispinus 

say that you have not swear unto your paper 
to blot her white cheek with her dregs and bottom 
of your friend private vice say you swear 
your love and your allegiance to bright virtue 
make you descend so low as to put on 
the office of a executioner 
only to strike off the head of sin 
where ere you find it stand 
say you swear 
and make damnation parcel of your oath 
that when your lash jest make all man bleed 
yet you whip none court city country friend 
foe all must smart alike yet court nor city 
nor foe nor friend dare winch at you great pity 

if you swear dam i Faninus or Crispinus 
or to the law our kingdom golden chain 
to poet dam i or to player dam i 
if I brand you or you tax you scourge you 
I wonder then that of five hundred four hundred five 
shall all point with their finger in one instant 
at one and the same man

Come you can excuse it

we come like your physician to purge 
your sick and dangerous mind of her disease 

in troth we do out of our love we come 
and not revenge but if you strike we still 
we must defend our reputation 
our pen shall like our sword be always sheathe 
unless too much provoke Horace if than 
they draw blood of you blame we not we be man 
come let thy muse bear up a smooth sail 
it be the easy and the base art to rail

to a true reckon first to arm our wit 
with complete steel of judgement and our tong 
with sound artillery of phrase then 
our body must be motion move first 
what we speak afterward our very knee 
must humble seem to talk and suit out speech 
for a true furnish courtier have such force 
though his tongue faint his very leg discourse 

son Terrill thou have draw his picture right 
for he be no fullmade courtier nor well string 
that have not every joint stick with a tongue 
daughter if lady say that be the bride that be she 
gaze thou at none for all will gaze at thou 

then o my father must I go o my husband

I will but give i leave 
to say I may not nor I ought not say not 
still I must go let i entreat I may not 

you must and shall I make a deed of gift 
and give my oath unto the king I swear 
by thy true constancy 

then keep that word 
to swear by oh let i be constant still 

what shall I cancel faith and break my oath 

if break constancy thou break they both 

thy constancy no evil can pursue 

I may be constant still and yet not true 

as how 

as thus by violence detain 
they may be constant still that be constrain 

constrain that word weigh heavy yet my oath 
weigh down that word the king thought be at odds 
they be not even balance in his breast 
the king may play the man with i nay more 
king may usurp my wife be a woman yet 
it be more than I know yet that know not she 
if she shall prove mankind it be rare fie fie 
see how I lose myself among my thought 
think to find myself my oath my oath

by my long stocking and my narrow skirt 
not make to sit upon she shall to court

that when my eye serve love commission 
upon thy beauty I do seize on they 
to a king use cure all thy grief with this 
that his great seal be grave upon this ring 
and that I be but steward to a king 

lady and gentleman you be almost all welcome to this sweet nuntion of plum 

almost all sir Vaughan why to which of we be you so niggardly that you cut she out but a piece of welcome 

my interpretation be that almost all be welcome because I indite a brace or two more that be not come I be sorry my lady pride be not among you 

'slid he make hound of we ningle a brace quoth he 

Peter salamander draw out the picture of all the joint stool and lady sit down upon their wooden face 

I warrant sir I will give every one of they a good stool 

master Horace master Horace when I pray to God and desire in hypocriteness that bald sir Adam be here then then then begin to make you rail at the poverty and beggarly want of hair 

leave it to my judgment 

m Bubo sit there you and I will think upon our end at the table m Horace put your learned body into the midst of these lady so it be no matter to speak grace at nuntion because we be all past grace since dinner 

mass I thank my destiny I be not past grace for by this hand full of caraway I can never abide to say grace 

mistress Miniver be not that innocent gentleman a kind of fool 

why do you ask madam 

nay for no harm I ask because I think you two have be of acquaintance 

I think he be within a inch of a fool 

madam Philocalia you sit next that spare gentleman will you hear what mistress Miniver say of you 

why what say she madam Dicache 

nay nothing but wish you be marry to that small timber gallant 

your wish and i be twin I will so too for then I shall be sure to lead a merry life 

yes faith lady I will make you laugh my bolt now and then shall be soon shoot by these comfit weed let all slide 

he take the sweet oath that ever I hear a gallant of his pitch swear by these comfit and these caraway I warrant it do he good to swear 

yes faith it be meat and drink to i 
I be glad lady Petula by this apple that they please you 

Peter salamander wine I beseech you master Asinius Bubo not to swear so deep for there come no fruit of your oath here lady I put you all into one corner together you shall all drink of one cup 

Peter I prithee fill i out too 

I will fling you out too and I may have my will a pox of all fool 

mistress Miniver pray be lusty will sir Adams Prickshaft stick by you 

who the bald knight sir Vaughan 

the same m Horace he that have but a remnant or parcel of hair his crown be clip and pare away methinks it be a excellent quality to be bald for and there stick a nose and two eye in his pate he may wear two face under one hood 

as God save i la if I may have my will I will rather be a bald gentleman than a hairy for I be sure the best and tall yeoman in England have bald head methinks hair be a scurvy lousy commodity 

Bubo herein you blaze your ignorance 

pray stop and fill your mouth and give m Horace all your ear 

for if of all the body part the head 
be the most royal if discourse wit judgement 
and all our understanding faculty 
sit there in their high court of parliament 
enact law to sway this humorous world 
this little I will of man needs must that crown 
which stand upon this supreme head he fair 
and hold invaluable and that crown be the hair 
the head that want this honour stand awry 
be hare in name and in authority 

he mean baldpate mistress Miniver 

hair it be the robe which curious nature weave 
to hang upon the head and do adorn 
our body in the first hour we be horn 
God do bestow that garment when we die 
that like a soft and silken canopy 
be still spread over we in spite of death 
our hair grow in our grave and that alone 
look fresh when all our other beauty be go 
the excellence of hair in this shine clear 
that the four element take pride to wear 
the fashion of it when fire most bright do burn 
the flame to golden lock do strive to turn 
when her lascivious arm the water hurl 
about the shore waist her sleek head she curl 
and rorid cloud be suck into the air 
when down they melt hang like fine silver hair 
you see the earth who head so oft it shear 
fright to feel her lock so rude tear 
stand with her hair a end and thus afraid 
turn every hair to a green naked blade 
beside when strike with grief we long to die 
we spoil that most which most do beautify 
we rend this headtire off I thus conclude 
colour set colour out our eye judge right 
of vice or virtue by their opposite 
so if fair hair to beauty add such grace 
baldness must needs be ugly vile and base 

true m Horace for a bald reason be a reason that have no hair upon it a scurvy scald reason 

by my true I never think you can have pick such strange thing out of hair before 

nay my ningle can tickle it when he come to it 

troth I shall never be enamel of a bareheaded man for this what shift soever I make 

then mistress Miniver S Adam Prickshaft must not hit you Peter take up all the clothes at the table and the plum

there where it leave off baldness 

I shall win 
no praise by praise that which to deprave 
all tongue be ready and which none will have 

to prove that best by strong and arm reason 
who part reason fear to take can but prove 
your wit be fine temper and from these win love

to crown bald head therefore must bald thrive 
but be it as it can to what before 
go arm at table this force bring I more 
if a bare head be like a deadman scull 
shall bear up no praise else but this it set 
our end before our eye shall I despair 
from give baldness high place than hair 

nay perdie hair have the high place 

the goodly and most glorious strangebuilt wonder 
which that great architect have make be heaven 
for there he keep his court it be his kingdom 
that be his best masterpiece yet it be the roof 
and ceiling of the world that may be call 
the head or crown of earth and yet that be bald 
all creature in it bald the lovely sun 
have a face sleek as gold the fullcheeked moon 
as bright and smooth as silver nothing there 
wear dangle lock but sometime blaze star 
who flaming curl set realm on fire with war 
descend more low look through man fivefold sense 
of all the eye bear great eminence 
and yet that be bald the hair that like a lace 
be stitch unto the lid borrow those form 
like penthouse to save the eye from storm 

right well say 

a head and face overgrow with shaggy dross 
oh it be a orient pearl hide all in moss 
but when the head be all naked and uncrowned 
it be the world globe even smooth and round 
〈◊〉 be nature but attain which our life 
shoot her last arrow what man ever lead 
his age out with a staff but have a head 
bare and uncover he who year do rise 
to their full height yet not bald be not wise 
the head be wisdom house hair but the thatch 
hair it be the base stubble in scorn of it 
this proverb spring he have more hair than wit 
mark you not in derision how we call 
a head grow thick with hair bushnatural 

by your leave master poet but that bushnatural be one of the trim and most entangle beauty in a woman

if a clear merit stand upon his praise 
reach he a poet crown the honour bay 
but if he claim it want right thereto 
as many bastard son of poesy do 
race down his usurpation to the ground

shine in thy number and thy soul I know 
will not go arm in passion against thy foe
