and none of the parish talk she carry it 
so handsome these moral I have read

I will call her sister 

what if there be one 
already that do please i will you not 
repine and look awry upon we when we 
make much of one another 

so you will but sometime smile on i too I will endeavour 

Well say this may do good upon i as 
I find you prompt in this I may consider 
other matter to tell you true I love 
your kinswoman

in the way you wot on but 
I find her cold and peevish how she may 
be bring about I know not it will show well 
and be a precedent for other wife 
if you will put your help to it 

goodness bless i 

one woman with another can do more 
in such a cause than twenty man I do not 
wander you see out of the blood this will 
be a way to justify your obedience 

you show a tyrant now and stead of frame 
my soul to patience murder both Exit 

I have go too far a conscience this may 
spoil all and now I think upon it I be 
a coxcomb to discover any party 
I must deny it again and carry thing 
more close how now will enter Hazard 

how now will be that all 
look up and ask i a question like a man 
what melancholy 

no no a toy a trifle 

that shall be a woman who be it thou be think on 
I have be of your counsel 

I be think of my wife 

I meet she sad 

I can blame she 
we have have a dialogue come thou know my bosom 

when do mean to lie with she 

I know not but I have offer fair condition 
she be very confident I do not dote 
upon her beauty I have tell she sirrah 
I love her kinswoman 

you be not so mad 

the world deceive in she she will give i leave 
to ramble where I list and feed upon 
what best delight my appetite 

he that have 
a ambition to be strangle in his sleep 
may tell his wife he love another woman 

but I be not content with this because 
the other wench be somewhat obstinate 
I must needs urge my wife to mollify 
and mould she for my purpose 

and she consent too 

no it will not do 
This go against her stomach and we part 

next time you see she look to be present 
with your mistress nose for this do think a woman 
can be so patient to know her rival 
in the same roof and leave her eye to see thou 
again I be sorry for thou 

I be confident 
she dare not but for all that will I have 
be less particular 

Come I love thou well 
but not thy wit to carry thing no handsome 
you must unravel again and make your wife 
believe you do but try she 
how now what be the news here 

quick to a surgeon bear he gentle 

what be the business 

Nothing sir but a gentleman be kill and we be 
carry he to a surgeon 

it be Jack Delamore he be not dead 

who hurt he 

master Beaumont we can stay sir 

why they be friend 

but wine make they fall out some say about 
their mistress 

I do expect a woman at one end on it 
what miserable fool be man to kill 
one another for these cockatrice 

I be sorry for poor Beaumont 

it will be long ere any mistress will 
be so desperate for her servant this be valour 
high and mighty valour 

Men must preserve 
their honour man thou do not know their quarrel 

thou be hold a piece of a killcow too look to it before the session take a order with thou be it not a great deal safe now to skirmish with a petticoat and touse a handsome wench in private then be valiant in the street and kiss the gallow for it hang hang this foolery let gentleman rather live and pay their tailor then let their clothes enrich the hangman wardrobe 

but skirmish as you call it with the petticoat 
be by some hold away to this preferment 
your wench have be stickler and some man 
drop in their quarrel 

let they be such coxcomb 
they can die too soon can I have 
a lady of pleasure but to please her humour 
I must be engage to fight and kill man for she 
because her health refuse another nose 
or tooth prefer substantial ground for murder 
we spend our blood too much another way 
consumption take i if I fight for one on they 
I will drink single beer first and live honest 
gentleman be come to a fine pass do not you 
think but it be possible I may fight for all this 

there may be cause that have woman in they 
but I confess no polecat or lewd strumpet 
though I do use the trick of the flesh shall drive 
i to the surgeon I have a mother 

and I have a wife will thou have her 

no no she be well as she be 
there may be honour to defend these 

sometime 

but there be a mischief great than all these 
a base and sordid provocation 
use among gentleman they can quarrel 
about a glass of wine but our file streigth 
son of a whore dead mother must be tear 
out of their grave or live have their name 
poison by a prodigious breath it be 
a brave and noble law to make this tongue 
be cut for it it will save much blood in the year 
that may be spend more honourable 

the lie grow a dull provocation this have quicken we but leave this common place thou can not help it let we talk of something else stay be not this Beaumont 

apprehend alas poor gentleman how now Ned 

as you see gentleman call to my account 

we hear a piece of the misfortune but 
be not deject he may live

I will with he and know the story 

it will but trouble i 
I can do he no service beside that 
I be engage to meet old master Barnacle 
whither whither gentleman with your sword draw 

do not see a gentleman lead to prison 
we will rescue he from the officer come join with we 
we shall draw more to the cause 

you do not mean 
this rashness hide your sword be advise better

you must needs pardon i I believe the stout 
that now will seem all fire and sword will go 
with as ill will to hang as another

of the two to go to the tavern and be drink 
in your own defence a wench be not so dangerous 
nor the disease that wait upon she 

what if the gentleman that be hurt shall die 
then there be no hope for other 

less for you 
you will be guilty of his murder too 
and snatch he from the law why you may do it 
it be pity but the government shall thank you 
and if you escape the halter for it it may be 
another man in time may cut your throat

solicitor for your safety and although 
on the first proposition it appear

what most concern you I be confident 
you will accept and thank i 

noble sir 
you do express so be be bounty man

will guide i to acknowledge and pay back 
my service and myself for so much charity 
as you have please to show i

thy word and place i where I may unseen 
hear their discourse 

this way 

but with your pardon 
I will desire to hear again how much 
I shall be oblige that know the extent 
of your desert I may pay back a duty 
that may in every circumstance become 
my fortune and the benefit 

then thus you be a prisoner that alone 
be misery 
but you the great in that guilt of blood 
not sum that may be recompense detain you 
I will not dispute the circumstance Delamore 
slay by your hand 

I have confess 
the first jury have find it murder 

his blood call to the law for justice and you can 
left to yourself and look on the fact 
expect with any comfort what must follow 
yet I in pity of your suffering 
in pity of your youth which will be else 
untimely blast offer to remove 
your sorrow make you free and right again 
with clear satisfaction to the law 

good sir

however your will and charity may be active 
in my desire to save i that you can 
assure my life and freedom since in cause 
of such high nature law must have their course 
who stream as it be wickedness to pollute 
it be vanity for any private man 
to think he can resist I speak not this 
to have you imagine I despise my life 
but to express my fear your will do flatter you 
above what your power can reach 

for that I urge not 
my be a commissioner alone 
to do you service I have friend in court 
and great one when the rigor of the law 
have sentence you to mediate your pardon 
nor take it from the justice of a prince 
where provocation and not malice make 
guilty to save who the sharp letter doom 
sometime to execution I be to far 
from doubt your discharge that I dare forfeit 
my life if I secure not you from any 
danger for this offence 

you speak all comfort 
which way can I deserve this 

that I will show you 
I have a obligation to your father 
who love when all my fortune be in the ebb 
and desperate relieve i with large sum 
by who careful manage I arrive at what 
I be and I shall be a rebel to 
nature and goodness not to love the son 
of such a friend by his misfortune make 
ripe for my gratitude 

you speak your bounty 
but teach not all this while how to deserve it 

it be do by your acceptance of my daughter 
to be your bride 

to be my bride pray tell tell i 
be she deform or wanton what vice have she 

vice sir she will deserve as good a husband 
she be handsome though I say it and shall be rich too 

Shee be too good if she be fair or virtuous 
pardon I know she be both but you amaze i 
I do expect condition of danger 
a good wife be a blessing above health 
you teach i to deserve my life first from you 
by offer a happiness beyond it 

if you find love to accept it be the reward 
I look for Leonora shall obey 
or quit a father 

ha goodness defend 
I know you do but mock i and upbraid 
my act that kill her servant wound i still 
I have deserve her curse I see she weep 
and every tear accuse i 

may I never 
thrive in my prayer to heaven if what I offer 
I wish not hearty confirm 

I now 
suspect you be not Leonora father 
it be better you dissemble then make she 
so past all hope of be cure again 
I marry Leonora can her soul 
think on so foul a rape she can sure 

she shall I command 

by virtue but 
she shall nor will I to grasp a empire 
tempt she to so much stain let she tell down 
her virgin tear on Delamore cold marble 
sigh to his dust and call revenge upon 
his head who anger send he to those shade 
from whence she never must see he this will justify 
she love the dead it be impiety 
one smile shall bless her murderer and however 
you be please to compliment with my affliction 
I know she can find one thought without she 
so foul to look upon i 

let it rest on that will you confirm and timely make provision for your safety 

for my life 
you mean now on the chance than I may live 
you be confident and think it not impossible 
your daughter may affect i there be at once 
two blessing be they not and mighty one 
consider what I be how low how lose 
to the common air 

now you be wise 

but if 
your daughter will confirm this and propound 
herself my victory 

what then 

I shall condemn she and despise the conquest 
these thing may bribe a atheist not a lover 
but you perhaps be ignorant I have give 
my faith away irrevocable it be 
the wealth of Violante and I will 
base steal back a thought and yet I thank you 
I be not so inhuman 

will you not 
prefer your life 
to honour and religion 

for shame be silent can you make i lord 
of my own destiny and that Leonora 
have empire for her dower and court i 
with all the flattery of life to quit 
my vow to Violante I will die 
upon her bosom to meet death 

and death 
you must expect which will take off this bravery 

and I will kiss it kiss it like a bride 

so resolute 

and if I can live 
my violantes I will die her sacrifice 
good sir no more you do not well to trouble 
the quiet of a prisoner thus that can 
be a too careful steward of those minute 
leave he to make his peace tempt i no further 
the earth be not so fix as my resolve 
rather to die then in one thought transplant 
my love from Violante 

be undo 
and this contempt shall hasten the divorce 
of soul and love die and be soon forget Exit 

my Violante if there can be any joy 
neighbour too so much grief I will pour it out 
to pay thy bounteous visit if my eye 
admit no fellowship in weep it be 
because my heart which see thou first will bid 
thou welcome thither scorn to acknowledge 
there can be any thing but joy where thou be 

but sadness my dear Beaumont while there be 
a cause that make thou prisoner I must weep 
and empty many spring my eye be now 
no prophet of thy sorrow but the witness 
and when I think of death that wait upon thou 
I wither to a ghost 

why Violante 
we must all die restrain these weep fountain 
keep they till I be dead dispense they then 
upon my grave and I shall grow again 
and in the sweet disguise of a fair garden 
salute the spring that give i green and odour 
why shall not love transform we 

be not lose 
in these imagination 

or perhaps 
thou have ambition she who love make up 
a wonder to the world beside the pledge 
of duty to her lord fame Artemisia 
shall be no more in story for her tomb 
for on the earth that weigh my body down 
when I be dead thy tear by the cold breath 
of heaven congeal to Beaumont memory 
shall raise a monument of pearl to our do 
the great Mausolus sepulchre 

no more 
of this vain language if you have any pity 
on the poor Violante 

I have do 
and yet I be go now to a long silence 
allow my sorrow to take leave Violante 

it shall be so be valiant my heart 
Beaumont I come not to take leave of thou 

perhaps you will see i again 

again and often 
thy star be gentle to thou many day 
and year be yet between thou and that time

disperse the cloud sit heavy on my brow 
wipe the moisture hence it be day again

and by the duty of my love be bind 
to hide your resolution can you be 
so merciless to yourself to refuse life 
when it be offer with the best advantage
