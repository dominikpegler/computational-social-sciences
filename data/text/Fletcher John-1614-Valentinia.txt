I never see the like she be not more stir 
no more another woman no more alter 
with any hope or promise lay to she 
let they be never so weighty never so win 
than I be with the motion of my own leg 

Chilax 
you be a stranger yet in these design 
at least in Rome tell i and tell i truth 
do you ere know in all your course of practice 
in all the way of woman you have run through 
for I presume you have be bring up Chilax 
as we to fetch and carry 

true I have so 

do you I say again in all this progress 
ever discover such a piece of beauty 
ever so rare a creature and no doubt 
one that must know her worth too and affect it 
I and be flatter else it be none and honest 
honest against the tide of all temptation 
honest to one man to her husband only 
and yet not eighteen not of age to know 
why she be honest 

I confess it free 
I never see her fellow nor ever shall 
for all our grecian dame all I have try 
and sure I have try a hundred if I say two 
I speak within my compass all these beauty 
and all the constancy of all these face 
maid widow wife of what degree or calling 
so they be greek and fat for there be my cunning 
I will undertake and not sweat for it Proculus 
be they to try again say twice as many 
under a thousand pound to lay they bedrid 
but this wench stagger i 

do you see these jewel 
you will think these pretty bait now I will assure you 
here be half the wealth of Asia 

these be nothing 
to the full honour I propound to she 
I bid she think and be and present 
whatever her ambition what the council 
of other will add to she what her dream 
can more enlarge what any precedent 
of any woman rise up to glory 
and stand certain there and in the high 
can give she more nay to be empress 

and cold at all these offer 

cold as crystal 
never to be thaw again 

I try she further 
and so far that I think she be no woman 
at least as woman go now 

why what do you 

I offer that that have she be but mistress 
of as much spleen as dove have I have reach she 
a safe revenge of all that ever hate she 
the cry down for ever all beauty 
that may be think come near she 

that be pretty 

I never know that way fail yet I will tell you 
I offer she a gift beyond all you 
that that have make a saint start well consider 
the law to be her creature she to make it 
her mouth to give it every creature live 
from her aspect to draw their good or evil 
fix in they spite of fortune a new nature 
she shall be call and mother of all age 
time shall be she and what she do lame virtue 
shall bless to all posterity her air 
shall give we life her earth and water feed we 
and last to none but to the emperor 
and then but when she please to have it so 
she shall be hold for mortal 

and she hear you 

yes as a sick man hear a noise or he 
that stand condemn his judgement let i perish 
but if there can be virtue if that name 
be any thing but name and empty title 
if it be so as fool have be please to saigne it 
a power that can preserve we after ash 
and make the name of man outreckon age 
this woman have a god of virtue in she 

I will the emperor be that God 

she have in her 
all the contempt of glory and vain seem 
of all the stoic all the truth of Christian 
and all their constancy modesty be make 
when she be first intend when she blush 
it be the holy thing to look upon 
the pure temple of her sect that ever 
make nature a bless founder 

be there no way 
to take this phoenix 

none but in her ash 

if she be fat or any way incline 
to ease or pleasure or effect glory 
proud to be see and worship it be a venture 
but on my soul she be chaste than cold camphire 

I think so too for all the way of woman 
like a full sail she bear against I ask she 
after my many offer walk with she 
and she as many downdenial how 
if the emperor grow mad with love shall force she 
she point to a Lucrece that hang by 
and with a angry look that from her eye 
shoot vestal fire against i she depart 

this be the first wench I be ever pose in 
yet I have bring young love thing together 
this two and thirty year 

I find by this wench 
the call of a bawd to be a strange 
a wise and subtle call and for none 
but stay discreet and understand people 
and as the tutor to great Alexander 
will say a young man shall not dare to read 
his moral book till after five and twenty 
so must that he or she that will be bawdy 
I mean discreet bawdy and be trust 
if they will rise and gain experience 
well steep in year and discipline begin it 
I take it it be no boy play 

well what be think off 

the emperor must know it 

if the woman shall chance to fail too 

as it be ten to one 

why what remain but new net for the purchase 

let we go consider then and if all fail 
this be the first quick eel that save her tail exeunt 

you still insist upon that idol honour 
can it renew your youth can it add wealth 
that take off wrinkle can it draw man eye 
to gaze upon you in your age can honour 
that true be a saint to none but soldier 
and look into bear no reward but danger 
leave you the most respect person live 
or can the common kiss of a husband 
which to a sprightly lady be a labour 
make you almost immortal you be cozen 
the honour of a woman be her praise 
the way to get these to be see and seek too 
and not to bury such a happy sweetness 
under a smoky roof 

I will hear no more 

that white and red and all that bless beauty 
keep from the eye that make it so be nothing 
than you be rare fair when man proclaim it 
the phoenix be she never see be doubt 
that most unvalued horn the unicorn 
bear to oppose the huntsman be it nothing 
but tale and mere tradition will help no man 
but when the virtue be know the honour be double 
virtue be either lame or not at all 
and love a sacrilege and not a saint 
when it bar up the way to man petition 

nay you shall love your husband too we come not 
to make a monster of you 

be you woman 

you will find we so and woman you shall think too 
if you have grace to make your use 

eye on you 

alas poor bashful lady by my soul 
have you no other virtue but your blush 
and I a man I shall run mad for those 
how dainty they set she off how sweet 

Come goddess come you move too near the earth 
it must not be a better orb stay for you 
here be a maid and take 

pray leave i 

that be a sin sweet lady and a way 
to make we guilty of your melancholy 
you must not be alone in conversation 
doubt be resolve and what stick near the conscience 
make easy and allowable 

you be devil 

that you may one day bless for your damnation 

I charge you in the name of chastity 
tempt i no more how ugly you seem to i 
there be no wonder man defame our sex 
and lay the vice of all age on we 
when such as you shall bear the name of woman 
if you have eye to see yourselves or sense 
above the base reward you play the bawd for 
if ever in your life you hear of goodness 
though many region off as man hear thunder 
if ever you have mother and they soul 
if ever father and not such as you be 
if ever any thing be constant in you 
beside your sin or come but your curse 
if ever any of your ancestor 
die worth a noble deed that will be cherish 
soulfrighted with this black infection 
you will run from one another to repentance 
and from your guilty eye drop out those sin 
that make you blind and beast 

you speak well lady 
a sign of fruitful education 
if your religious zeal have wisdom with it 

this lady be ordain to bless the empire 
and we may all give thank for it 

I believe you 

if any thing redeem the emperor 
from his wild fly course this be she 
she can instruct he if you mark she be wise too 

exceed wise which be a wonder in she 
and so religious that I well believe 
though she will sin she can 

And beside 
she have the empire cause in hand not love 
there lie the main consideration 
for which she be chief bear 

she find that point 
strong than we can tell she and believe it 
I look by her mean for a reformation 
and such a one and such a rare way carry 
that all the world shall wonder at 

it be true 
I never think the emperor have wisdom 
pity or fair affection to his country 
till he profess this love god give they child 
such as her virtue merit and his zeal 
I look to see a Numa from this lady 
or great than Octavius 

do you mark too 
which be a noble virtue how she blush 
and what a flow modesty run through she 
when we but name the emperor 

but mark it 
yes and admire it too for she consider 
though she be fair as heaven and virtuous 
as holy truth yet to the emperor 
she be a kind of nothing but her service 
which she be bind to offer and she will do it 
and when her country cause command affection 
she know obedience be the key of virtue 
then fly the blush out like Cupid arrow 
and though the tie of marriage to her lord 
will fain cry stay Lucina yet the cause 
and general wisdom of the prince love 
make she find sure end and happy 
and if the first be chaste this be twice double 

her tartness unto we too 

that be a wise one 

I rare like it show a rise wisdom 
that chide all common fool as dare inquire 
what prince will have private 

what a lady 
shall we be bless to serve 

go get you from i 
you be your purse agent not the prince 
be this the virtuous lore you train i out too 
be I a woman fit to imp your vice 
but that I have a mother and a woman 
who ever live fame turn all it touch 
into the good itself be I shall now 
even doubt myself I have be search so near 
the very soul of honour why shall you two 
that happy have be as chaste as I be 
fair I think by much for yet your face 
like ancient well build pile show worthy ruin 
after that angel age turn mortal devil 
for shame for womanhood for what you have be 
for rot cedar have bear goodly branch 
if you have hope of any heaven but court 
which like a dream you will find hereafter vanish 
or at the best but subject to repentance 
study no more to be ill speak of 
let woman live themselves if they must fall 
their own destruction find they not your sevour 

madam you be so excellent in all 
and I must tell it you with admiration 
so true a joy you have so sweet a fear 
and when you come to anger it be so noble 
that for my own part I can still offend 
to hear you angry woman that want that 
and your way guide else I count it nothing 
be either fool or coward 

she be a mistress for no private greatness 
can she not frown a ravishd kiss from anger 
and such a anger as this lady learn we 
stick with such please danger god I ask you 
which of you all can hold from 

I perceive you 
your own dark sin dwell with you and that price 
you sell the chastity of modest wife at 
run to disease with your bone I scorn you 
and all the net you have pitch to catch my virtue 
like spider web I sweep away before i 
go tell the emperor you have meet a woman 
that neither his own person which be godlike 
the world he rule nor what that world can purchase 
nor all the glory subject to a Cesar 
the honour that he offer for my body 
the hope gift everlasting flattery 
nor any thing that be his and apt to tempt i 
no not to be the mother of the empire 
and queen of all the holy fire he worship 
can make a whore of 

you mistake we lady 

yet tell he this have thus much weaken i 
that I have here his knave and you his matron 
fit nurse for his sin which god forgive i 
but ever to be lean to his folly 
or to be bring to love his lust assure he 
and from her mouth who life shall make it certain 
I never can I have a noble husband 
pray tell he that too yet a noble name 
a noble family and last a conscience 
thus much for your answer for yourselves 
you have live the shame of woman die the better exit 

what be now to do Lucina 

even as she say to die 
for there be no live here and woman thus 
I be sure for we two 

Nothing stick upon she 

we have lose a mass of money well dame virtue 
yet you may halt if good luck serve 

worm take she 
she have almost spoil our trade 

so godly 
this be ill breed phorba 

if the woman 
shall have a long now to see this monster 
and she convert they all 

that may be phorba 
but if it be I will have the young man geld 
come let we go think she must not escape we thus 
there be a certain season if we hit 
that woman may be rid without a bit exeunt 

I can blame the nation noble friend 
that they fall off so fast from this wild man 
when under our allegiance be it speak 
and the most happy tie of our affection 
the world weight groan beneath he where live virtue 
honour discretion wisdom who be call 
and choose to the steer of the empire 
but bawd and sing girl o my aecius 
the glory or a soldier and the truth 
of man make up for goodness sake like shell 
grow to the ragged wall for want of action 
only your happy self and I that love you 
which be a large mean to i then favour 

no more my worthy friend though these be truth 
and though these truth will ask a reformation 
at least a little square yet remember 
we be but subject Maximus obedience 
to what be do and grief for what be ill do 
be all we can call we the heart of prince 
be like the temple of the god pure incense 
until unhallowed hand defile those offering 
burn ever there we must not put they out 
because the priest that touch those sweet be wicked 
we dare not dear friend nay more we can 
while we consider why we be and how 
to what law bind much more to what lawgiver 
while majesty be make to be obey 
and not inquire into while god and angel 
make but a rule as we do though a strict 
like desperate and unseasoned fool let fly 
our kill anger and forsake our honour 

my noble friend from who instruction 
I never yet take surfeit weigh but thus much 
nor think I speak it with ambition 
for by the god I do not why aecius 
why be we thus or how become thus wretched 

you will fall again into your fit 

I will not 
or be we now no more the son of roman 
no more the follower of their happy fortune 
but conquer Gaul or quiver for the parthian 
why be this emperor this man we honour 
this God that ought to be 

you be too curious 

good give i leave why be this author of we 

I dare not hear you speak thus 

I will be modest 
thus lead away thus vain lead away 
and we beholder misconceive i not 
I sow no danger in my word but wherefore 
and to what end be we the son of father 
famous and fast to Rome why be their virtue 
stamp in the danger of a thousand battle 
for goodness sake their honour time out dare 
I think for our example 

you speak noble 

why be we seed of these then to shake hand 
with bawd and base informer kiss discredit 
and court she like a mistress pray your leave yet 
you will say the emperor be young and apt 
to take impression rather from his pleasure 
then any constant worthiness it may be 
but why do these the people call his pleasure 
exceed the moderation of a man 
nay to say just friend why be they vice 
and such as shake our worth with foreign nation 

you search the sore too deep and I must tell you 
in any other man this have be boldness 
and so reward pray depress you spirit 
for though I constant believe you honest 
you be no friend for i else and what now 
you free speak but good you owe tooth empire 
yet take heed worthy Maximus all ear 
hear not with that distinction my do few 
you will find admonisher but urger of your action 
and to the heavy friend and pray consider 
we be but shadow motion other give we 
and though our pity may become the time 
just our power can make i worthy 
to be your ever friend in fair allegiance 
but not in force for dare my own soul urge i 
and by that soul I speak my just affection 
to turn my hand from truth which be obedience 
and give the helm my virtue hold to anger 
though I have both the blessing of the brutij 
and both their instigation though my cause 
carry a face of justice beyond they 
and as I be a servant to my fortune 
that dare soul that first teach disobedience 
shall feel the first example say the prince 
as I may well believe seem vicious 
who just know it be not to try our honour 
or say he be a ill prince be we therefore 
fit fire to purge he no my dear friend 
the elephant be never win with anger 
nor must that man that will reclaim a lion 
take he by the tooth 

I pray mistake i not 

our honest action and the light that break 
like morning from our service chaste and blush 
be that that pull a prince back then he see 
and not till then true repent his error 
when subject crystal soul be glass to he 

my ever honour friend I will take your council 
the emperor appear I will leave you to he 
and as we both affect he may he flourish Exit Max 

be that the best news enter the emperor and Chilax 

yet the best we know sir 

bid Maximus come to i and be go then 
my own head be my helper these be fool 
how now aecius be the soldier quiet 

better I hope sir than they be 

they be please I hear 
to censure i extreme for my pleasure 
short they will fight against i 

god defend sir 
and for their censure they be such shrewd judger 
a donative of ten sesterce 
I will undertake shall make they ring your praise 
more than they sing your pleasure 

I believe thou 
be thou in love aecius yet 

o no sir 
I be too course for lady my embrace 
that only be acquaint with alarm 
will break their tender body 

never fear it 
they be strong than you think they will hold the hammer 
my empress swear thou be a lusty soldier 
a good one I believe thou 

all that goodness 
be but your grace creature 

tell i true 
for thou dare tell i 

any thing concern you 
that be fit for i to speak and you to pardon 

what say the soldier of i and the same word 
mince they not good aecius but deliver 
the very form and tongue they talk withal 

I will tell your grace but with this caution 
you be not stir for shall the god live with we 
even those we certain believe be righteous 
give they but drink they will censure they too 

forward 

then to begin they say you sleep too much 
by which they judge your majesty too sensual 
apt to decline your strength to ease and pleasure 
and when you do not sleep you drink too much 
from which they fear suspicion first than ruin 
and when you neither drink nor sleep you wench much 
which they affirm first break your understanding 
then take the edge of honour make we seem 
that be the rib and rampire of the empire 
fencer and beat fool and so regard 
but I believe they not for be these truth 
your virtue can correct they 

they speak plain 

they say moreover since your grace will have it 
for they will talk their freedom though the sword 
be in their throat that of late time like Nero 
and with the same forgetfulness of glory 
you have get a vain of file so they term it 

some drunken dream aecius 

so I hope sir 
and that you rather study cruelty 
and to be fear for blood then love for bounty 
which make the nation as they say despise you 
tell your year and action by their death 
who truth and strength of duty make you Caesar 
they say beside you nourish strange devourer 
feed with the fat of the empire they call bawd 
lazy and lustful creature that abuse you 
a people as they term they make of paper 
in which the secret sin of each man money 
be seal and send a work 

what sin be next 
for I perceive they have no mind to spare i 

nor hurt you o my soul sir but such people 
nor can the power of man restrain it 
when they be full of meat and ease must prattle 

forward 

I have speak too much sir 

I will have all 

it fit not 
your ear shall hear their vanity no profit 
can just rise to you from their behaviour 
unless you be guilty of those crime 

it may be 
I be so therefore forward 

I have ever 
learned to obey nor shall my life resist it 

no more apology 

they grieve beside sir 
to see the nation who our ancient virtue 
with many a weary march and hunger conquer 
with loss of many a dare life subdue 
fall from their fair obedience and even murmur 
to see the warlike eagle mew their honour 
in obscure town that wont to prey on prince 
they cry for enemy and tell the captain 
the fruit of Italy be luscious give we Egypt 
or sandy Africa to display our valour 
there where our sword may make we meat and danger 
digest our well get viand here our weapon 
and body that be make for shine brass 
be both unedge and old with ease and woman 
and than they cry again where be the german 
line with hot Spain or Gallia bring they on 
and let the son of war steel Mithridates 
lead up his wing parthian like a storm 
hide the face of heaven with shower of arrow 
yet we dare fight like roman then as soldier 
tire with a weary march they tell their wound 
even weeep ripe they be no more nor deep 
and glory in those scar that make they lovely 
and sit where a camp be like sad pilgrim 
they reckon up the time and live labour 
of Julius or Germanicus and wonder 
that Rome who turret once be top with honour 
can now forget the custom of her conquest 
and then they blame your grace and say who lead we 
shall we stand here like statue be our father 
the son of lazy moor our prince Persian 
nothing but silk and softness curse on they 
that first teach Nero wantonness and blood 
Tiberius doubt Caligula all vice 
for from the spring of these succeed prince 
thus they talk sir 

well 
why do you hear these thing 

why do you do they 
I take the god to witness with more sorrow 
and more vexation do I hear these tainture 
then be my life drop from i through a hourglass 

belike than you believe they or at least 
be glad they shall be so take heed you be better 
build your own tomb and run into it live 
then dare a prince anger 

I be old sir 
and ten year more addition be but nothing 
now if my life be please to you take it 
upon my knee if ever any service 
as let i brag some have be worthy notice 
if ever any worth or trust you give i 
deserve a fair respect if all my action 
the hazard of my youth cold burn want 
for you and for the empire be not vice 
by that style you have stamp upon i soldier 
let i not fall into the hand of wretch 

I understand you not 

let not this body 
that have look brave in his blood for Cesar 
and covetous of wound and for your safety 
after the escape of sword spear sling and arrow 
against which my beat body be my armour 
the sea and thirsty desert now be purchase 
for slave and base informer I see anger 
and death look through your eye I be mark for slaughter 
and know the tell of this truth have make i 
a man clean lose to this world I embrace it 
only my last petition sacred Cesar 
be I may die a roman

and worthy of my love reclaim the soldier 
I will study to do so upon myself too

the mother of thy black sin will have blush at 
behold and curse thyself the god will find thou 
that be all my refuge now for they be righteous 
vengeance and horror circle thou the empire 
in which thou live a strong continue surfeit 
like poison will disgorge thou good man raze thou 
for ever be read again but vicious 
woman and fearful maid make vow against thou

and shake his strong steel at thou 

This prevail not 
nor any agony you utter lady 
if I have do a sin curse she that draw i 
curse the first cause the witchcraft that abuse i 
curse those fair eye and curse that heavenly beauty 
and curse your be good too

thou can not 
for that which be my honour thou have murder 
and can there be a love in violence

thy villainy than flattery that be thy own 
the other base counterfeit fly from i 
or for thy safety sake and wisdom kill i 
for I be worse than thou be thou may pray 
and so recover grace I be lose for ever 
and if thou let i live thou be lose thyself too

call in your lady bawd and guild pander 
and let they triumph too and sing to Cesar 
Lucina fall the chaste lucnia conquer 
god what a wretched thing have this man make i 
for I be now no wife for Maximus 
no company for woman that be virtuous 
no family I now can claim nor country 
nor name but Caesar whore oh sacred Cesar 
for that shall be your title be your empire 
your rod and axe that be type of justice

and where there have a chaste wife be abuse 
let it be thou the shame thy thou the slaughter 
and last for ever thou the fear example 
where shall poor virtue live now I be fall 
what can your honour now and empire make i 
but a more glorious whore 

a better woman 
but if you will be blind and scorn it who can help it 
Come leave these lamentation they do nothing 
but make a noise I be the same man still 
be it to do again therefore be wise 
by all this holy light I shall attempt it 
you be so excellent and make to ravish 
there be no pleasure in you else 

o villain 

So breed for man amazement that my reason 
and every help to hold i right have lose i

at home before you they have have some sport too 
but be more thankful for it exit emperor

and point as I pass there there behold she 
look on her little child that be she 
that handsome lady mark oh my sad fortune 
be this the end of goodness this the price 
of all my early prayer to protect i 
why then I see there be no god but power 
nor virtue now alive that care for we

aecius must not take farewell thou phoenix 
if thou will die Lucina which well weigh 
if you can cease a while from these strange thought

to draw from that wild man a sweet repentance and goodness in his day to come 

they be so 
and will be ever come my aecius 

for who know but the sight of you present 
his swell sin at the full and your fair virtue 
may like a fearful vision fright his folly 
and once more bend he right again which blessing 
if your dark wrong will give you leave to read 
be more than death and the reward more glorious 
death only ease you this the whole empire 
beside compel and force with violence 
to what you have do the deed be none of you 
no nor the justice neither you may live 
and still a worthy woman still more honour 
for be those tree the worse we tear the fruit from 
or shall the eternal god desire to perish 
because we daily violate their truth 
which be the chastity of heaven no lady 
if you dare live you may and as our sin 
make they more full of equity and justice 
so this compulsive wrong make you more perfect 
the empire too will bless you 

noble sir 
if she be any thing to i but honour 
and that that be wed to i too lay in 
not to be wear away without my be 
or can the wrong be she alone or i 
or both our wrong not tide to after issue 
not bear anew in all our name and kindred 
I will desire she live nay more compel she 
but since it be not youth but malice do it 
and not her own nor i but both our loss 
nor stay it there but that our name must find it 
even those to come and when they read she live 
must they not ask how often she be ravishd 
and make a doubt she love that more than wedlock 
therefore she must not live 

therefore she must live 
to teach the world such death be superstitious 

the tongue of angel can alter i 
for can the world again restore my credit 
as fair and absolute as first I breed it 
that world I shall not trust again the empire 
by my life can get nothing but my story 
which while I breathe must be but his abuse 
and where you council i to live that Cesar 
may see his error and repent I will tell you 
his penitence be but increase of pleasure 
his prayer never say but to deceive we 
and when he weep as you think for his vice 
it be but as kill drop from baleful ewgh tree 
that rot their honest neighbour if he can grieve 
as one that yet desire his free conversion 
and almost glory in his penitence 
I will leave he robe to mourn in my sad ash 

the farewell then of happy soul be with thou 
and to thy memory be ever sing 
the praise of a just and constant lady 
this sad day while I live a soldier tear 
I will offer on thy monument and bring 
full of thy noble self with tear untold yet 
many a worthy wife to weep thy ruin 

all that be chaste upon thy tomb shall flourish 
all live epitaph be thou time story 
and what be leave behind to piece our life 
shall be no more abuse with tale and trifle 
but full of thou stand to eternity 

once more farewell go find Elysium 
there where the happy soul be crown with blessing 
there where it be ever spring and ever summer 

there where no bedrid justice come truth honour 
be keeper of that bless place go thither 
for here thou live chaste fire in rot timber 

and so our last farewell 

god give the justice exit Lucina 

his thought begin to work I fear he yet 
he ever be a noble roman but 
I know not what to think on it he have suffer 
beyond a man if he stand this 

aecius 
be I alive or have a dead sleep seize i 
it be my wife the emperor abuse thus 
and I must say I be glad I have she for he 
must I not my aecius 

I be strike 
with such a stiff amazement that no answer 
can ready come from i nor no comfort

to keep i company I be a fellow 
my own sword will forsake not tie unto i 
a pandar be a prince to what I be fall

and yet I bless the maker 
death o my soul must I endure this tame 
must Maximus be mention for his tale 
I be a child too what shall I do rail 
I can mend myself it be Caesar do it 
and what be I to he 

it be well consider 
however you be taint be no traitor 
time may outwear the first the last live ever 

o that thou be not living and my friend 

I will bear a wary eye upon your action 
I fear you maximus nor can I blame thou 
if thou break out for by the god thy wrong 
deserve a general ruin do you love i

then go with i 
you shall not to your own house 

nor to any 
my grief be great far than wall can compass 
and yet I wonder how it happen with i 
I be not dangerous and o my conscience 
shall I now see the emperor in the hear on it 
I shall not chide he for it a awe run through i 
I feel it sensible that bind i to it 
it be at my heart now there it sit and rule 
and methinks it be a pleasure to obey it 

this be a mask to cozen i I know you 
and how far you dare do no roman far 
nor with more fearless valour and I will watch you 
keep that obedience still 

be a wife loss 
for her abuse much good may do his grace 
I will make as bold with his wife if I can 
more than the fade of a few fresh colour 
more than a lusty spring lose 

no more maximus 
to one that true live 

why then I care not I can live well enough aecius 
for look you friend for virtue and those trifle 
they may be buy they say 

he be craze a little 
his grief have make he talk thing from his nature 

but chastity be not a thing I take it 
to get in Rome unless it be bespeak 
a hundred year before be it aecius 
by our lady and well handle too in the breed 

will you go any way 

I will tell thou friend 
if my wife for all this shall be a whore now

of your fall fortune what to say I know not 
for it be too true the emperor desire not 
but my best master any soldier near he 

and when he understand he cast your fortune 
for disobedience how can we incline he 
that be but under person to his favour 
to any fair opinion can you sing 

not to please he Aretius for my song 
go not to the lute or viol but to the trumpet 
my tune keep on a target and my subject 
the well strike wound of man not love or woman 

and those he understand not 

he shall Phidias 

can you not leave this kill way a little 
you must if here you will plant yourself and rather 
learn as we do to like what those affect 
that be above we wear their action 
and think they keep we warm too what they say 
though oftentimes they speak a little foolish 
not stay to construe but prepare to execute 
and think however the end fall the business 
can run empty hand 

can you flatter 
and if it be put to you lie a little 

yes if it be a live 

that be well say then 

but must these lie and flattery be believe then 

o yes by any mean

I tell you I abhor they they be ill way 
and I will starve before I fall into they 
the doer of they wretch their base hunger 
care not who bread they eat nor how they get it 

what then sir 

if you profess this wickedness 
because you have be soldier and bear arm 
the servant of the brave aecius 
and by he put to the emperor give i leave 
or I must take it else to say you be villain 
for all your golden coat debauch base villain 
yet I do wear a sword to tell you so 
be this the way you mark out for a soldier 
a man that have command for the empire 
and bear the reputation of a man 
be there not lazy thing enough call fool and coward 
and poor enough to be prefer for pander 
but want soldier must be knave too ha 
this the trim course of life be not you bear bawd 
and so inherit but your right I be poor 
and may expect a worse yet dig prune 
mend of break way carry of water 
plant of word and onion any thing 
that be honest and a man I will rather choose 
I and live better on it which be just 
drink my well get water with more pleasure 
when my endeavour do and wage pay i 
than you do wine eat my course bread not curse 
and mend upon it your diet be disease 
and sleep as sound when my labour bid i 
as any forward pander of you all 
and rise a great deal honest my garment 
though not as you the soft sin of the empire 
yet may be warm and keep the bite wind out 
when every single breath of poor opinion 
find you through all your velvet 

you have hit it 
nor be we those we seem the lord aecius 
put we good i to the emperor so we have serve he 
though much neglect for it so dare be still 
your curse be not we we have see your fortune 
but yet know no way to redeem it mean 
such as we have you shall not want brave Pontius 
but pray be temperate if we can wipe out 
the way of your offence we be you sir 
and you shall live at court a honest man too 

that little meat and mean we have we will share it 
fear not to be as we be what we tell you 
be but mere trial of your truth you be worthy 
and so we will ever hold you suffer better 
and than you be a right man Pontius 
if my good master be not ever angry 
you shall command again 

I have find two good man use my life 
for it be you and all I have to thank you exeunt 

there be no way else to do it he must die 
this friend must die this soul of Maximus 
without who I be nothing but my shame 
this perfectness that keep i from opinion 
must die or I must live thus brand ever 
a hard choice and a fatal God be you have give i 
a way to credit but the ground to go on 
you have level with that precious life I love most 
yet I must on and through for if I offer 
to take my way without he like a sea 
he bear his high command twixt i and vengeance 
and in my own road sink i he be honest 
of a most constant loyalty to Cesar 
and when he shall but doubt I dare attempt he 
but make a question of his ill but say 
what be a Cesar that he dare do this 
dead sure he cut i off aecius dies 
or I have lose myself why shall I kill he 
why shall I kill myself for it be my kill 
aecius be my root and whither he 
like a decay branch I fall to nothing 
be he not more to i than wife than Cesar 
though I have now my safe revenge upon he 
be he not more than rumour and his friendship 
sweet than the love of woman what be honour 
we all so strange be bewitch withal 
can it relieve i if I want he have 
can honour betwixt the incense prince and envy 
bear up the life of worthy man he have 
can honour pull the wing of fearful coward 
and make they turn again like tiger he have 
and I have live to see this and preserve so 
why shall this empty word incite i then 
to what be ill and cruel let she perish 
a friend be more than all the world than honour 
she be a woman and her loss the less 
and with her go my grief but hark you maximus 
be she not you do she not die to tell you 
she be a ravish woman do not justice 
noble begin with she that not deserve it 
and shall you live that do it stay a little 
can this abuse die here shall not man tongue 
dispute it afterward and say I give 
affect dull obedience and tame duty 
and lead away with fondness of a friendship 
the only virtue of the world to slander 
be not this certain be not she a chaste one 
and such a one that no compare dwell with she 
one of so sweet a virtue that aecius 
even he himself this friend that hold i from it 
out of his worthy love to i and justice 
have it not be on Caesar he have revenge she 
by heaven he tell i so what shall I do then enter a servant 
can other man affect it and I cold 
I fear he must not live 

my lord the general 
be come to seek you 

go entreat he to enter 
oh brave aecius I can wish thou now 
as far from friendship to i as from fear 
that I may cut thou off like that I weigh not 
be there no way without he to come near it 
for out of honesty he must destroy i 
if I attempt it he must die as other 
and I must lose he it be necessity 
only the time and mean be all the difference 
but yet I will not make a murder of he 
take he direct for my doubt he shall die 
I have find a way to do it and a safe one 
it shall be honour to he too I know not 
what to determine certain I be so trouble 
and such a deal of conscience press i enter aecius 
will I be dead myself 

you run away well 
how get you from i friend 

that that lead mad man 
a strong imagination make i wander 

I think you have be more settle 

I be well 
but you must give i leave a little sometime 
to have a buzz in my brain 

you be dangerous 
but I will prevent it if I can you tell i 
you will go to the army 

why to have my throat cut 
must he not be the brave man aecius 
that strike i first 

you promise i a freedom 
from all these thought and why shall any strike you 

I be a enemy wicked one 
worse than the foe of Rome I be a coward 
a cuckold and a coward that be two cause 
why every one shall beat i 

you be neither 
and dare another tell i so he die for it 
for thus far on my honour I will assure you 
no man more love than you and for your valour 
and what you may be fair no man more follow 

a doughty man indeed but that be all one 
the emperor not all the prince live 
shall find a flaw in my coat I have suffer 
and can yet let they find infliction 
I will find a body for they or I will break it 
it be not a wife can thrust i out some look for it 
but let they look till they be blind with look 
they be but fool yet there be anger in i 
that I will fain disperse and now I think on it 
you tell i friend the province be stir 
we shall have sport I hope then and what be dangerous 
a battle shall beat from i 

why do you eye i 
with such a settle look

Oure love and love soul have be so use

or to redeem your name from root out 
to quit you brave fight from the foe 
or fetch you off where honour have engage you 
I ought and will die for you 

Truly speak 
what beast but I that must can hurt this man now 
will he have ravish i I will have pay he 
I will have teach he such a trick his eunuch 
nor all his blackeyed boy dream of yet 
by all the god I be mad now now be Caesar 
within my reach and on his glorious top 
the pile of all the world he go to nothing 
the destiny nor all the dame of hell 
be I once grapple with he shall relieve he 
no not the hope of mankind more all perish 
but this be word and weakness 

you look strange 

I look but as I be I be a stranger 

to i 

to every one I be no roman 
nor what I be do I know 

then I will leave you 

I find I be best so if you meet with Maximus 
pray bid he be a honest man for my sake 
you may do much upon he for his shadow 
let i alone

but one of all the world that can content i 
and snatch away in show if your wife

and save your life raise i this noble beauty 
as when I force she full of constancy 
or by the god 

most sacred Caesar 

slave 

good Proculus 

by heaven you shall not see it 
it may concern the empire 

ha what say thou 
be she not dead 

not any one I know sir 
I come to bring your grace a letter here 
scatter belike in the court it be send to Maximus 
and bear danger in it 

danger where 
double our guard 

nay nowhere but in the letter 

what a afflict conscience do I live with 
and what a beast I be grow I have forget 
to ask heaven mercy for my fault and be now 
even ravish again her memory 
I find there must be danger in this deed 
why do I stand dispute then and whine 
for what be not the god to give they can 
though they will link their power in one do mischief 
this letter may betray i get you go exeunt 
and wait i in the garden guard the house well 
and keep this from the empress the name Maximus 
run through i like a favour this may be 
some private letter upon private business 
nothing concern i why shall I open it 
I have do he wrong enough already yet 
it may concern i too the time so tell i 
the wicked deed I have do assure i it be so 
be what it will I will see it if that be not 
part of my fear among my other sin 
I will purge it out in prayer 
how what be this 
letter red lord Maximus you love aecius 
and be his noble friend too bid he be less 
I mean less with the people time be dangerous 
the army be he the emperor in doubt 
and as some will not stick to say decline 
you stand a constant man in either fortune 
persuade he he be lose else though ambition 
be the last sin he touch at or never 
yet what the people make with love he 
and as they willing desire another 
may tempt he too or rather force his goodness 
be to be doubt main he be all 
as he stand now but the mere name of Cesar 
and shall the emperor enforce he lesser 
not come from himself it be more dangerous 
he be honest and will hear you doubt be scatter 
and almost come to growth in every household 
yet in my foolish judgement be this master 
the people that be now but rage and he 
may be again obedience you shall know i 
when Rome be fair again till when I love you 
no name this may be cunning yet it seem not 
for there be nothing in it but be certain 
beside my safety 
have not good Germanicus 
that be as loyal and as straight as he be 
if not prevent by Tiberius 
be by the soldier force their emperor 
he have and it be my wisdom to remember it 
And be not Corbulo even that Corbulo 
that ever fortunate and live Roman 
that break the heart string of the parthian 
and bring arsase line upon their knee 
chain to the awe of Rome because he be think 
and but in wine once fit to make a Cesar 
cut off by Nero I must seek my safety 
for it be the same again if not beyond it 
I know the soldier love he more than heaven 
and will adventure all his god to raise he 
i he hate more than peace what this may breed 
if dull security and confidence 
let he grow up a fool may find and laugh at 
but why lord Maximus I injure so 
shall be the man to council he I know not 
more than he have be friend and love allegiance 
what now he be I fear for his abuse 
without the people date draw blood who wait there 

your grace enter a servant 

call Phidias and Aretus hither 
I will find a day for he too time be dangerous 
the army his the emperor in doubt 
I find it be too true do he not tell i 
1 as if he have intent to make i odious 
2 and to my face and by a way of terror 
what vice I be ground in and almost 
proclaim the soldier hate against i be not 
the sacred name and dignity of Cesar 
be this aecius more than man sufficient 
to shake off all his honesty he be dangerous 
though he be good and though a friend a fear one 
and such I must not sleep by be they come yet 
I do believe this fellow and I thank he 
it be time to look about if I must perish 
yet shall my fear go foremost 

life to Cesar 

be lord Aeciuss wait 

not this morning 
I rather think he be with the army 

army 
I do not like that army go unto he 
and bid he straight attend i and do you hear 
come private without any I have business 
only for he 

your grace pleasure exit Phidias 

go 
what soldier be the same I have see he often 
that keep you company Aretus 

i sir 

i you sir 

one they call Pontius

a captain 

yes he be so 
but speak something rough in his want 
especial of war the noble general 
out of a strict allegiance cast his fortune 

have be a valiant fellow 

so he be still 

Alas the general may have pardon folly 
soldier will talk sometime 

I be glad of this 

he want preferment as I take it 

yes sir 
and for that noble grace his life shall serve 

I have a service for he 
I shame a soldier shall become a beggar 
I like the man Aretus 

god protect you 

bid he repair to Proculus and there 
he shall receive the business and reward for it 
I will see he settle too and as a soldier 
we shall want such 
the sweet of heaven still crown you 
I have a fearful darkness in my soul 
and till I be deliver still be die exeunt 

my way have take all the court be in guard 
and business everywhere and every corner 
full of strange whisper I be least in rumour 
and so I will keep myself here come aecius

as disobedience 

dare you not defend you 
against your enemy

I have no power to make such enemy 
for as I be condemn my naked sword 
stand but a hatchment by i only hold 
to show I be a soldier have not Cesar 
chain all defence in this doom let he die 
old as I be and quench with scar and sorrow 
yet will I make this wither arm do wonder

and hold i in the rank of dangerous person 
and I must die say it be but justice

for there be nothing now but truth to save i 
and your forgiveness though you hold i heinous 
and of a trouble spirit that like fire 
turn all to flame it meet with you mistake i 
if I be foe to any thing it be ease 
want of the soldier due the enemy 
the nakedness we find at home and scorn 
child of peace and pleasure no regard 
nor comfort for our scar but how we get they 
to rusty time that eat our body up 
and even begin to prey upon our honour 
to want at home and more than want abuse 
to they that when the enemy invade 
make we their saint but now the sore of Rome 
to silken flattery and pride plain over 
forget with what wind their feather sail 
and under who protection their soft pleasure 
grow full and numberless to this I be foe 
not to the state or any point of duty 
and let i speak but what a soldier may 
true I ought to be so yet I err 
because a far more noble sufferer 
show i the way to patience and I lose it 
this be the end I die sir to live base 
and not the follower of he that breed i 
in full account and virtue Pontius dare not 
much less to outlive what be good and flatter
