if you work with gordon you learn
that right away

code i have hear a lot about this

sort of shorthand

we be heading into a difficult situation

how do you figure

i will explain it to you
do you remember
Lils dance





lil be wearing a sour face

what do you mean

she face have a sour look
that means
we be going to have trouble with the
local authority
they be not going to
be receptive to the

both eye blinking means there be going
to be trouble high up
the eye of the
local authority
sheriff and a deputy
that would be i guess
two of the
local law enforcer be going to be a
problem

if you notice she have one hand in she
pocket which mean they be hide
something and the other hand make a
fist which mean they be going to be
belligerent

lil be walking in place which mean
there be going to be a lot of legwork
involve

cole said lil be he mother sister
girl
what be missing in that sentence
the uncle

oh the uncle be miss

not coles uncle but probably the
sheriff uncle in federal prison

so the sheriff have get an uncle who be
committed a serious crime

right which be probably why lil be
wearing a red wig meaning we be
headed into a dangerous situation
let
i ask you something stanley do you
notice anything about the dress

the dress she be wearing have be
altered to fit she
i notice a different
colored thread where the dress have be
taken in

gordon would not have send we to deer
meadow without think it be a

twinkie




josie i think we should go public

that would be wonderful but it be only
be a year since andrew die

what be you afraid of
what people
think

i do not want to offend the custom of
you country

believe i josie you would not offend
the custom of this country
for
instance i do not eat fish eye

fish eye

even if it offended someone i would not
eat a fish eye

why would not you eat a fish eye harry

i see a guy eat a fish eye once in
seattle
he be digging through his
food with he chopstick for about five
minute till he find the fish eye and he
drop it into he throat
i guess it
must have get stick in he uvula
because right away he start to have
trouble
he throat begin to flutter
there like there be a wind blowing
and he could not swallow and they rush
to he and loosen he collar and they
be asking he if he be alright and
he start to turn blue and he eye
start to roll back into he head and he
still could not get the fish eye out and
they tried to do a Heimlich maneuver
i
go over to he as they be
preparing to do an emergency
tracheotomy
they be over he with
a knife when he suddenly shoot the fish
eye out of he throat and right onto the
ceiling
splat
it just stick up there
and spread out
it be about the size of
a half dollar
and that be why i do not ever
eat fish eye

i be not saying it be right or wrong it be
just the way i feel
it be the custom
thing i be think of
in america we
do not use any part of the fish but the
meat just to the side of the inside
we
throw away the tail the rest of the
inside and the head

i understand

we throw away the whole head

night

remember
