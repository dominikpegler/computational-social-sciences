off look
but we have meet
before
when i be a kid
at the
orphanage
see i mom die when i
be small
car accident i do not
really remember it
but a couple of
year later i dad be shoot over a
gamble debt
i remember that just
fine
look at wayne
not a lot
of people who know what it feel
like do they
to be angry
in you
bone
people understand foster
parent understand
for a while
then they expect the angry kid to
do what he know he can never do
to move on
to forget

so they stopped understand and
send the angry kid to a boy home
st
Swithins
used to be funded
by the wayne foundation
see i
figure it out too late
you have
to hide the anger
practice smile
in the mirror
like putting on a
mask
you show up one day in a
cool car pretty girl on you arm


we be so excite bruce wayne
billionaire orphan
we make up
story about you
legend
the
other boy story be just that
but when i see you i know who you
really be
beat
i would see
that look on you face
same one i
taught myself

i do not know why you take the fall
for dent murder but i be still a
believer in the batman
even if
you be not

why do you say you boy home
used to be funded by the wayne
foundation

because the money stopped
might be
time to get some fresh air and
start paying attention to the
detail
some of those detail
might need you help

you checked that name
bane

run it through some database
he be
a mercenary
no other known name
never be see or photograph
without a mask
he and he man be
behind a coup in west africa that
secure mining operation for we
friend john daggett

now Daggetts bring they here

it would seem so
i will keep
dig


why do the wayne foundation stop
fund boy home in the city

the foundation be funded from the
profit of wayne enterprise
off look
there have to be some

time to talk to mr
fox i think

i will get he on the phone

no
do we still have any car
around the place

one or two

and i need an appointment at the
hospital
about i leg

which hospital sir

whichever one jim gordons in



mr
fox i believe in what mr
wayne be trying to do


i be only asking for explanation
because i think i can help

i will pass along you request
next
time i see he

he do not talk to you either

let we just say that bruce wayne have
he
eccentricity

mr
fox be you aware that john
daggett be trying to acquire share
in wayne enterprise

i be not
but it would not do he
any good mr
wayne still retain
a clear majority

bruce wayne
as i live and breathe

what bring you out of cryosleep
mr
wayne

i see you have not lost you sense
of humor
even if you have lost
most of i money

actually you do that yourself
see if you funnel the entire and
budget for five year into a
fusion project that you then
mothball you company be unlikely
to thrive


even with

wildly sophisticated yes
wayne enterprises be running out of
time
and daggett be moving in

what be i option

if you be not will to turn you
machine on

i can not lucius

then sit tight
you majority keep
daggett at arm length while we
figure out a future for the energy
program with miranda tate she be
supported you project all the way
she be smart and quite lovely

you too lucius

we all just want what be good for
you bruce
show she the machine

i will think it over

anything else

no why

these conversation always used to
end with some
unusual request

i retired

let i show you some stuff anyway


i figure you would have shut this
place down

it be always shut down
officially

but all this new stuff

after you father die wayne
enterprise set up fourteen
different defense subsidiary
i have spent year shuttering they
and consolidating all the
prototype under one roof
i roof

why

stop they falling into the wrong
hand
besides i think someone
might get some use out of they

sure i can not tempt you to
something
pneumatic crampon
infrared lense
least let i get
you something for that leg

it be fine the use it get these
day

well then i have just the thing
for an eccentric billionaire who
do not like to walk


now you be just showing off

defense department project for
tightgeometry urban pacification
rotor configure for maneuvering
between building without
recirculation

what be it called

it have a long and uninteresting
wayne enterprise designation
so i
take to calling it the bat
and
yes mr
wayne it do come in
black

work great except for the
autopilot

what be wrong with that

Softwarebased instability
take a
good mind than mine to fix it

good mind

i be trying to be modest
less
busy mind
yours perhaps

i told you
i retired lucius

i have see bad cartilage in knee



that be good

no that be because there be no
cartilage in you knee
and not
much of any use in you elbow and
shoulder
between that and the
scar tissue on you kidney
residual concussive damage to you
brain tissue and general
scarredover quality of you
body
take a deep breath
i
cannot recommend that you go
heliskiing
about the only part of
you body that look healthy be
you liver so if you be bore i
recommend you take up drink mr
wayne

we be in this together
then you
be go

the batman be not needed anymore
we win

build on a lie
we lie
now
there be evil rising from where we
tried to bury it
nobody will
listen
the batman have to come
back

miss tate be not it

even before you become a recluse
you never come to these thing

true
proceed go to the big fat
spread not the because
it be not
about charity it be about feeding
the ego of whichever society hag
laid it on

actually this be i party mr
wayne

oh

and the proceed will go where they
should because i paid for the big
fat spread myself

that be very generous of you

you have to invest to restore
balance to the world
take we
cleanenergy project

sometimes the investment do not
pay off
sorry


you have a practiced apathy mr
wayne
but a man who do not care
about the world do not spend half
he fortune on a plan to save it
gentle
and be not so wounded when
it fail that he go into
hide

have a good evening mr
wayne

mind if i cut in

you do not seem very happy to see
i

you be suppose to be a shutin

stand on the shoulder of people
with less

robin hood

i would do more to help someone than
most of the people in this room
than you

or maybe you be be unrealistic
about what be really in you pants
other than you wallet

wayne
you and you friend good batten

that drive

i do not need to
three

it seem you make a series of large
put option on the future
exchange
verify by thumb print
the option expired at midnight
last night

long term we may be able to prove
fraud but for now
you be
completely broke
and wayne
enterprise be about to fall into
the hand of john daggett

the weapon we can not let daggett
get he hand on apply science

apply science be shut up tight
and off the book
the energy
project be a different story

miranda tate
we need to convince
the board to get behind she
let we
show she the reactor

we be meeting she there in
thirtyfive minute
you well get
dressed


you bring i out here to show i
a rubbish dump mr
fox

bear with i miss tate

keep you hand and foot inside the
car at all time

this be it be not it

the reactor be beneath the river so
that it could be instantly flooded
in an event of a security breach

be bruce wayne really that
paranoid

i be going to plead the fifth on that
one

i think you might like to see
what you investment build


no radiation no fossil fuel
free clean energy for an entire
city

if it worked
it do not

ignition yes
but no chain
reaction

you have build a lot of security
around a damp squib
about three year ago a russian
scientist published a paper on
weaponized fusion reaction
one
week later you reactor start
develop problem
look at
wayne
i think this machine work

miranda if it be operational
the danger to gotham would be too
great

would it make you feel well to
know that the russian scientist
die in a plane crash six month
ago

someone else will work out what dr
pavel do
someone else will figure
out how to turn this power source
into a nuclear weapon
i need you
to take control of wayne
enterprise and this reactor

and to do what with it

nothing
until we can find a way to
guarantee it safety


and if we can not

decommission it
flood it

destroy the world good chance for
a sustainable future

if the world not ready
yes

bruce if you want to save the
world you have to start trust
it

i be trusting you

do not count
you have no choice

i could have flooded this chamber any
time in the last three year
i be
choosing to trust you miranda and
that be not the easy thing for
i

can survive so that you can watch
they clamber over each other to
stay in the sun

where a thousand man have
languish for year
under the
dent act
under the name of this


harvey dent
hold up to you and
over you as a shine example of
justice and good

we be going to keep moving you till
we can get you in front of a camera



but they supply you a false idol
straw man
to placate
to stop
you tearing down this corrupt
city



and rebuilding it the way it
should have be rebuilt
generation ago

let i tell you the truth about
harvey dent
in the word of
Gothams police commissioner james
gordon

the truth about harvey dent be
simple in only one regard it have
be hidden for too long
after he
devastate injury harveys mind
have recovered no good than he
mutilate face
he be a break
dangerous man not the crusader for
justice that i james gordon have
portray he to be for the last
eight year
harveys rage be
indiscriminate
psychopathic
he
hold i family at gunpoint then
fell to he death in the struggle
over i sones life
the batman do
not murder harvey dent he saved


i boy
then take the blame for
harveys appal crime so that
i could to i shame build a lie
around this fall idol




i praise the madman who tried to
murder i own child


the thing we do in harveys name
bring desperately needed security
to we street
but i can no
longer live with i lie
it be time
to trust the people of gotham with
the truth and it be time for i to
resign

do you accept this mane
resignation

do you accept the resignation of
all the liar
all the corrupt


these man locked up in Blackgate
for eight year deny parole
under the dent act
base on a lie

lie to keep a city from burning
to the ground
gotham needed a
hero someone to believe in

not as much as it do now
but you
betrayed everything you stand for

there be a point
far out there
when the structure fail you
when
the rule be not weapon anymore
they be shackle letting the bad
get ahead
maybe one day you will
have such a moment of crisis
and
in that moment i hope you have a
friend like i do
to plunge they
hand into the filth so you can
keep yours clean

you hand look pretty filthy to
i commissioner

generation who have keep you down
with the myth of opportunity
and
we give it to you the people

interfere
do as you please


but start by storming Blackgate and
free the oppressed
step
forward those who would serve



for an army will be raised



the powerful will be ripped from
they decadent nest



and cast into the cold world the
rest of we have known and
endure



court will be convene




the spoil will be enjoy



blood will be she would



but the police will live until
they be ready to serve true
justice



this great city will endure



gotham will survive
