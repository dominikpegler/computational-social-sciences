of a young man narrate



there come a time in everyone
life when they discover that the
only person you can truly depend
on be yourself
that the only
real power anyone have to get
anything do be the power of one
with any luck you can make it
through a lot of year before you
ever have to face the reality of
that fact
it be a luxury i never have
i
discovered it the year i mother
have she nervous breakdown
one attendant hold the rear door of the car open for
the woman
before enter she turn one last time
toward the farmhouse
young looking one part scare one part sad and
one part lost stare back at she he hand hold by a
large amiable black woman with tear rolling down she
round cheek



i be all of six

the woman enter the car
the car drive off down the
road
the boy watch it disappear behind a plume of
swirling dust



i father die before i be born
and even though i be raised by
i zulu nanny with i mother
depending on she health in
nominal attendance it be
decided with she departure that
i too would depart
for board school
the dust the boy have be watch reverse itself
an unseen vehicle come up the road



but before i could be send out
into the world one very serious
matter have to be deal with
i be a chronic bedwetter
since
i nanny be the one responsible
for i wellbeing she do what
any responsible zulu mother would
do
she called on the great
medicine man of she tribe
Inkosi Inkosikazi
out of the dust a large black buick up
the road and into the yard scatter chicken and
goose stopping in front of the wideeyed sixyearold
and he tremulous nanny
huge zulu jump out of the
front passenger seat and open the rear door
moment
pass and then two splay crack foot descend from
the car and settle into the dust

year old small black wizen hair and beard
white than cotton a leopard skin draped over his
shoulder a bead fly switch in one hand a trussed
chicken in the other exit the car

fire burn bright in the black african night
the boy
sit holding the chicken close by the fire while Inkosi
Inkosikazi shuffle around he draw a circle in the
dust with a stick




legend have it that Inkosi
Inkosikazi be the last son of
the great zulu king Dingaan
who fight both the boer and
the british to a standstill
nearly year before and the
night Inkosi Inkosikazi be
conceive star fell from the
sky until the sun rose
the circle complete the old man sit down opposite the
boy
from a leather pouch he produce several bone
he
throw the bone on the ground and study they for a
moment
he begin to wave the fly switch back and forth
in front of the boy eye chant low softly
the
boy eye grow heavy
he lid droop
the boy and the old man be standing above a great
waterfall
in the swirling pool far below be ten
step stone linking one bank to the other



the medicine man instruct i to
jump off the fall and climb along
the ten step stone counting
as i go until i reach dry
land
the boy jump cascade down the fall and into the pond
below
he clamber up the first rock
it be slippery
he fall off and climb back on buffete by the spray
water
he make he way stone by stone toward the other
side



even though it be only a dream
i feel as if i struggle to reach
dry land be terrifyingly real
the water be like ice bone
chilling cold and as i make i
way from one stone to the next i
could feel i strength desert i
the progress from one step to the next get progressively
harder as the boy keep slipping into the swirling water
coughing and sputter



i be three rock in when i run
out of gas
i could not pull myself
any far
no matter how hard i

tried the current tried harder
i feel myself going under for the
last time
the boy grip slip off the rock
he start to go
under

the fire have go out
the boy be still sitting in the
circle the chicken still in he lap
he eye snap
open
the first thing he see be Inkosi Inkosikazi
sitting across from he with a big smile

Inkosi Inkosikazi enter the buick
the boy and he
smile nanny watch
they boy still hold the chicken



Inkosi Inkosikazi said the spirit
of the great zulu warrior live
in i
he told i that whenever
trouble arise i should return to
the waterfall and keep step
across the rock until the trouble
passed
he said three rock be
enough to conquer i problem with
the night water
that i be very
brave
he said i be a man for
all africa bound to she by i
spirit bound by i dream
and he let i keep the chicken
the boy and he nanny watch the car go off in a cloud of
dust

the boy sit on a train looking out the window at the
veldt and the wildlife moving across in the distance
sack on he lap move
the chicken head pop out
the boy give he some kernel of corn and scratch
behind he scraggly comb



although i be bound by spirit

and dream to africa i be bound
by heritage and language to the
birthplace of i grandparent
england a country i have never
see but one that be to because
i eminently more problem than

to see i daughter
correct

yes sir

and knowing who i be what i stand
for do you think this sort of
discussion be going to put that
request in a favorable light

i think a man of you intellectual
reputation would not want his
daughter seeing someone who do not
think

let i give you some advice then
you be right
i admire a keen
mind
but intellectual reputation
or not i be first a marais a
member of the volk

and if you be trying to impress a
member of the volk with you
intellect do not do it espouse
liberal idea picked up in an
english private school


these idea i picked up somewhere
else
marais open the library door

no doubt from an expert on race
relation

actually sir from an expert on
cactus

brilliant african sun beat down on the veldt below
on the rock a sevenyearold sit looking somewhat
sadly over the landscape
long shadow cover he
the of a be hear
turn shielding his
eye with he hand against the glare of the sun to a
tall whitehaired figure shirtless in hike boot
and kneesocks holding a box camera

ja
perfect
you will excuse i
please
speaking in Germanaccented english move off from
the sun glare down to PKs level
on he back be a
knapsack with a cactus sticking out of it

this i do not normally without
permission do ja
but to catch
the expression
after all it be
the expression that be important
ja
without the expression the
human being be just a lump of meat
you have some problem i think
i be professor karl von Vollensteen
doc click he heel together and bow he head slightly

i be

he hold out he hand
doc take it

such a young person with such an

old expression
i think we can
be friend
ja
Eighteenyearold narrate



that be how i meet doc as he
insist i call he
chance
meeting between a directionless
sevenyearold boy and an old
german professor out collecting
cactus on the african bush veldt
so begin i education
doc and walk the veldt across craggy mountain trail
down dry river bed through the jungle always collecting
cactus and aloe sample doc always talking always
explaining



doc believe the brain have two
function and that the south
african public school system
unfortunately deal with only one

the brain

have two function
it be the good reference library
ever which be a good thing to
have
ja
but also from it come
original thought
in school you
will get all filled up with the
fact
here you brain will learn
where to look how to look how
to think
and then you will have
for yourself all the brain that
have ever be
doc and sit high up
watch the endless animal
migration below while doc point thing out across the
landscape



doc know everything
he have a love
of learn
but he real passion
be center around two thing
music and cactus

and doc walk up a steep road toward doc house which
sit on top of the hill both carrying cactifilled

pack



until he be fifty doc have a
successful career as a concert
pianist all over europe
on he
fiftieth birthday he give it all
up and moved to south africa
from that point on it be all
cactus

behind doc simple whitewash cottage be a magnif
icent cactus and aloe garden filled with the sample doc
have collected for year
and doc plant another
specimen
doc photograph it
record it genus
in a notebook



every specimen doc find would be
carefully photograph and
catalogue

doc an walk through the cactus garden

if god would choose a plant to
represent he i think he would
choose of all plant the cactus
this one plant have all the
blessing he tried but failed to
give man
it be true
look
the cactus be humble but not
submissive
it grow where no
other plant will grow
the sun
bake it back the wind rip it
from cliff or drown it in the
dry desert sand
not a complaint
in good time or bad it will
still flower
it protect itself
from danger
doc touch a cactus needle

but it harm no other plant
it

have patience and solitude and
modesty
in mexico there be a
cactus that bloom once in a
hundred year and then only at
night
that be saintliness of
the high order i think
ja
from cactus come medicine to
heal the wound of man and little
button if you eat one you can
touch the face of god or stare
into the mouth of hell
it be
the plant of patience solitude
love and madness
modesty
beauty
toughness and gentleness
of all the plant i think it be
closest to god
ja



doc be a hard man to disagree
with
so when he decided i must
spend as much time with he to
remedy the flaw in i educational
environment i do not argue

Shabbilygenteel doc sit in he sunday good a cup of
tea on he lip talking in earnest to PKs pipe
puff also shabbilygenteel grandfather as look on



appeal to i grandfather
stoic belief in the primacy of
european culture in all it form
doc offered to instruct i in
piano in return for i help
he locate and gather he precious
cactus

doc and practice on a beautiful steinway so grandly
out of place in doc simple abode



as a student of music i be never
more than adequate something i
suspect doc know from the start
it be the love of music that be
most important he would tell i
and i would believe he


doc and wander through the jungle looking for flora

everything fit

nothing be
unexplained
nature be one big
chain reaction
everything
depend on everything else
from
the small to the big
always in life an idea start
small like a tree
doc show a small tree with an even small vine
attached to it

this tree can grow so high it can
touch the face of the sky
but
this little vine can choke it and
keep it small
most people be
like these vine
afraid of new
idea
afraid to let thing grow
doc rip the vine away from the tree

always listen to yourself
follow you own idea
if you be
wrong so what
you learn
something
and with learning you
grow strong
and if you be
right at the begin
an even
big bonus

doc and move alongside the great herd



i roam the kloofs and ridge
the dry riverbed and jungle
floor with doc for over a year
learning more than i realize even
today
i also play a lot more god
save the king due to i new
musical celebrity


Barberton a small town on the low veldt
in all it colonial backwater splendor



Barberton be a very proper
english town with a proper square
a wide main street and the
colonial overblown patriotism
for a homeland most people have
never see hanging in the air
like fine dust
not quite see
but there nonetheless

play god save the king on the stage
the town
population stand the man stoic
the woman dewey
eye at patriotic attention
some people file out
the man in officer uniform of the south african penal
system and they wife boer
they exit to the dagger
stare and some undertoned hiss and boo from she
Majestys loyal subject



the only Afrikaaners to live in
Barberton be send there to work
at the government prison just
outside town
germany have
covertly supported the boer in
they two unsuccessful war
against british rule supplying
food and medical supply as well
as ample stock of ammunition



germany be an old friend a
trust friend
and in a country
where a handshake be a friendship
and a friendship a bond for life
as the war in europe grow fierce
tension in Barberton heated up
suspicion be afoot
spy be
everywhere

tunnel on he stomach

you know the pyramid be nothing

entrance

a large cave perhaps
foot wide by foot high filled with stalactite
and stalagmite composed of pure crystallize calcium
carbonate

toward one end of the crystallize room eight stalagmite
grow up from the floor cement to form a huge crystal
slab some ten foot off the floor
buttress of stalg
mite drip off it form a natural if uneven stairway

here be how it work

the copper of the mine in
northern rhodesia be mined below
ground
all day a behemoth of a
man a diamond driller work a
stope which be like the top of a
funnel

huge diamond driller at work drilling and blast in
the stope



setting charge and drilling the
rock
the only way for the raw
ore he take from the side of
the stope to get to the haulage
below be to pass through the spout
of a funnel and out the steel
door at the bottom sixty foot
down

opening as the haulage cart fill with ore and move
away on the track in the tunnel below



halfway down the spout area be a
set of six tungsten steel bar
called a grizzly which catch all
the rock too large to make it
through the funnel mouth to safe
haulage
six bar with man working they



these be taken care of by a
grizzly an explosive expert
whose job it be to keep the ore
flow and since when the ore
do not flow neither do the
money working the grizzly be a
very crucial and therefore very
wellpaid position
three month

work earn a year stay at
oxford
yesterday on receiving
i blast license from the
school of mine i signed on to
work the bar for a year

crude place where the bar run the back length of the
room and the bare concrete surroundings offer nothing in
the way of diversion from the main purpose of be there
to drink hard and long
a harsh ruddyfaced welshman the school of
mine instructor down a drink pour another and look
up at

be you crazy
to sign on for
a year

you said i be the good you ever
teach sir

and you be boyo
the absolute
best

but even the good do not survive
a year on the bar
down in that
damn tube the luck run out sooner
than later
you may be a genius
at reading the rock but you be not
no fuckin fortune teller
thomas throw back another drink

and let i show you what i have
to show for it to this day
he hold up he hand
it shake noticeably

and that be thirteen year after

taste

he hold out he hand

he fix
with a portentous stare
thomas look over at the table
of driller
the man with the headache be down one
shoot after another

hell comino
he draw PKs attention to the driller

driller
he be get a powder
pain from breathin too much of
that damn gelignite
the pain

mix with a little
alcohol it be fuckin lethal
he watch the driller down two more shot of liquor

come on
we be not get much time
thomas direct towards the door

the two most dangerous thing
you will ever see in you life
boyo
a hangup of rock that
will not blast free on first shot
and a driller with a powder
headache drinkin
as they reach the door the behemoth explode with a
roar
he grab he head and stagger backwards
a mad
look come into he eye
he three huge frineds rush to grab he
he throw
they off as if they be ant
he rip a table out of it bolt to the concrete
floor and fling it across the room
the man drink in the bar all tough case begin to
flee
thomas grab whose eye stare in amazement as the
behemoth struggle against he three massive friend
and pull he out of the bar

pk be watch a rugby match be play at twilight
the player be a rough brutal bunch and play they

game accordingly
fight continually break out
off a play a fight break out
one of the man be kick
unconscious
two of he teammate carry he off the
field dumping he body unceremoniously like a sack of
potato on the sideline
they run back as play
resume
turn and walk back through the camp

companybuilt miner camp
cement hut with steel
door and corrugated roof
no shrubbery only dust
cement and the roughestlooking bunch of man assembled
on earth



dear morrie
to answer you
question
yessports be play
here but only in the loos
sense of the word sport and
play
the rule be
different for everything in
game as well as in the rest of
we live
the manager the
foreman the company people
they live apart from the miner
they have family
proper
garden
sunday dinner
the
minersthe crud as we be called
do not
this be a society of
man many of whom have past
well left behind
future do
not apply
it be a society only
in the loos sense of the word
the law of survival be simple
you either do or you do not
come down a side street
half a dozen man at
card hardface desperado see he pass eye he
closely
avert he eye
from behind he back
come the sound of loudly indecently
swallow hard
the sound of a turn he to
the six man bolting from they card game after he
whoop with lascivious intent
take off
the chase take and he pursuer flying through the
street of the camp past one identical cement hut after
another
people watch disinterested
no one raise
a hand to help
come racing around the corner to three of the man

block the street in front of he
he whirl
the
other catch up behind yell and hoot
the two
line advance
get ready
when the first man be close enough he
hit he hard breaking he jaw
he swing at another
catching he flush in the face
but then the rest be
upon he
even though fight like hell he be
overwhelmed
the blow come from everywhere beating
he to the ground
he arm and leg be firmly grab
by four man
he be bang hard face down onto a concrete
table
the fifth man pull down he pants and the sixth
begin to undo he own fly
all the man scream obsceni
tie anticipate the rape
struggle like hell to no avail
as he be about to
be violate a roar giant of a man tear into the
pack like a bear shred dog
he scatter the man
knocking some unconscious sending the rest to flight
he stand over a loom block of granite with a
wild black beard and coalblack eye
he intent only
become clear as to whether he be claiming a prize or
helping a friend when he offer he hand lifting
effortlessly
he examine PKs bruise face with some concern and
then smile

you know rasputin i have they
right where i wanted they
another minute they be do
for
rasputin clap on the back and address he in
russian to which respond with a smile
the two man
walk off together

play on a rickety

work out on a speed bag and a heavy bag he
have hung in the room while rasputin the giant russian
sit next to the record player finish drink a
bottle of brandy tear running down he face as he fol
low the symphony
when he finish the bottle he take
another one out of a case sitting by he side and begin
to drink anew



friendship be rarearising
out of mutual need rather than

any share interest
but they
do exist and even flourish
except between the driller and
they grizzly
no one want to
get too close to the man who
might be buried at night by what
you drill loose in the day

inspect he nightly quota of gelignite charge and
fuse
five african all serious face keep they eye firmly
on



the african who come here
looking for work be driven by a
different desperationdrought
famine locust
satisfy with the equipment nod for the box to be
close
he head man close the box



they come and risk they live to
send money back home to the
family sitting on the barren
farm starve waiting for
death or rain
when the box be closed the other five man in the crew
lift they and follow out

the elevator descend into the mine



superstition run deep in they
so a good grizzly man attract a
good crew
on the bar the
longer you live the lucky you
be
and by association they
be


and he crew make they way through a narrow tunnel
and come to the grizzly
it be dark
the only light
come from the lamp attached to they helmet
boulder litter the bar
and elijah be onto the bar first
they light
beam move along across the boulder

baas
baas
turn to elijah
he lamp catch Elijahs face
which be looking upward
look up
he in the narrow band of light
a bunch of rock
big and small packed into the funnel
he face grow
dim

five foot across a rock wall with stone of all size
block up the funnel mouth



hangup be the bad of it
when the top of the funnel get
blocked up and the ore will not
flow
scale the sheer rock wall of the funnel he shirt
packed with explosive



the only way to unblock it be to
set a charge to blow inward
and
the only way to do that be to set
the charge in mud which mean
climbing up to the mouth of the
stope and coming facetoface
with the devil
reach the hangup
he work at taking a prepare
parcel of gelignite stick and jamming they carefully
into a crevice
as he do the hangup creak deeply
shifting ominous
few rock fall
freeze
holding he breath


peek out of the safety shaft below terrify
elijah remains on the grizzly bar he light shining on


holding very still listening



sometimes the rock do not need
the provocation of explosive
sometimes the earth shift
a pebble move
you talk too loud
and in the moment before you be
turn into something else by
fifty ton of rock you understand
why it be called grizzly
finish setting the charge
he scale down the wall
large rock be expel from the hangup and come
bouncing down the side to the funnel just miss
crashing through the bar below
freeze
elijah hold he breath
the crew in the
safty tunnel quake
nothing happen
come down the rest of the way
he take the cordtex
rope dangle from the bomb and insert a fuse
he nod
to elijah
elijah light a cheesa stick
he hand the
glow stick to
wave towards the tunnel
one
of the african sound the
two blast
follow by two blast
nod for elijah to be off
elijah stand he ground

i wait for you baas
light the fuse
elijah take off like a scare
rabbit for the safety of the shaft
be right on he tail
the fuse travel quickly toward the bomb

elijah trip
coming behind he grab he by the
collar and fling he into the safety tunnel dive
after he a second later just as the

few rock come down but nothing else
the african look at each other with real apprehension
rise from elijah and peek out
be still in place
study the hangup step out onto the grizzly
listening looking
the hangup groan
the african
be petrified at the mouth of the tunnel
stop midway on the bar
he study the hangup
intently then pick up a rock
choosing a target he
heave the rock with all he might toward the hangup
and run like hell
the rock hit the hangup

spring off the grizzly right into the african as the
hangup thunder down
dust and small rock fill the
safety tunnel
when the avalanche have stopped raise himself off the
african
they be all covered in dust but smile and
babbling happy to be alive
peek out and up
he signal to elijah who hit the

three blast

let we clean she off and call it
a night hey
happy the african lift shovel and crowbar to clear
the bar
as they pass they touch he reverentially
as one would an icon



the african think the long you
survive the lucky you be
and
the lucky you be the long you
survive
i know there be something
inherently wrong with they logic
still i be beginning to see they
point
especially with less than
six month to go


and rasputin play a game of chess as
play in the background
there be a on the

come in
the bookmaker enter

ay man

pay off on

and so will i

you should let he win once in a
while

when he win it will not be because
i let he

checkmate


the elevator descend into the shaft
and he crew
exit
there be a low sound of a blast muffle that
stop they all

do you hear a blast whistle

no baas
then after a moment the vague sound of a drill leap
through the rock

i never hear a drill at night
the african get nervous
they chatter to one another

it be not a ghost
it be just some
driller trying to squeeze extra
pay
come on
move forward
the african follow he out of the
elevator with reluctance

step out onto the bar with elijah and examine the
debris

baas
there be a tremor of fear in he voice
follow
Elijahs face upwards to a hangup

not the first bloody thing

bad sign baas

bad drill more like it
come on
let we get it going

elijah go back to fix the charge while study
the hangup
he hear the african talking in the dark
when he light point on they they stop turning they
