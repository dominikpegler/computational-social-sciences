county hospital

cash or check before you come in
the door

some folk take that natural stuff
too far

junior wife keep she afterbirth
in the refrigerator
that be why i
do not eat over there now

country people get so many strange
way

do you ever have to use this
thing

that be called a crab apple switch
it be for those bad act monkey
and just the thing for a mean dog
now i do not know if i actually do
what i do or get i life and story
mixed in with other folk story
but i seem to recall that i have to
use i crab apple on a boy from
back home
i be up in memphis
working on the railroad like you
daddy who have an easy job
he would
sing a song that have a cadence and
we would lay track
anyway i be
coming down beale street and i
hear this music coming from a
saloon
sure enough it be emory
i daddy taught both of we to play
but emory be natural at it
get in
a blue band and what not
he and
another boy have killed a boy named
Hocker sometime back and they
ball the jack leave town
emory
have lost one eye and have a scar
running down he face
bad luck i
would say
he get to drink that
corn liquor
we go to he girl
room and he would not stop drink
he start talking about the old
day and he go mad
he pulled his
knife and i get to mine first
the
light go out

do not pick up the card if you be
not in the game
do he die

i do not know what happen to he
he just run out into the street
i get some old record i want you
to hear
i like the blue sung
simply man and a guitar
or sung
by a woman who have bad luck all she
life
do not ever let anyone tell
you he life story if it be of a
weary life full of sadness
when i
be a boy a man told i a story of
how he lost all of he son and
i will be damn if the same thing
do not happen to i

well

course it be you business but i
feel oblige to tell you that maybe
you have not be fair with the
boy

i tried to teach he right from
wrong just like i do he junior

everyone have to follow he own
plough
man do not have to know
how to cut a wick and clean a
chimney nowadays
city people do not
give a hoot and a holler about the
shape of the moon nowadays
you
do not plant old way
but at the end you find
yourself do what you father do
but you have to have the land in
you
it be when you want to give the
house or farm to the kid and they
do not want it
you sell it to a
stranger
you worked you whole
life for what
i doubt if people nowadays have
knowledge of a victory garden or
see an inch worm
all what we have
experience have no meaning

you be suppose to teach you
child what you know

do not have to worry about
babe
brother be a different story

you can talk you parent into
giving you you share of the
property

pop put big Daddys farm in
Rhondas and Sunnys name and fix
it so no one can borrow on it

we could borrow on that land and
put the money to work

but
if there be a way

do not make you human

we can not really bring another
family in here with we

way to do good

when do you talk to harry

you tappy head well not tear
down i house

look you well get out of i face
before i slap the live daylight
out of you

you folk excuse i but you know we
have a celebrity from out of the
past we own nightingale
if you
have any good time in you life
you remember hattie
she use to
keep those juke joint steaming
if
ma rainey and bessie smith be the
star she be the sun
let we get
hattie to sing something from the
old day

harry always try to be the king
fish
i told he i be a new person
i be saved

harry you will not remember i but
we go back quite a way
i be glad
hattie told i that you will be
here because there be a matter that
have be troubling i all these
year that maybe you can help i
clear it up

man i can not talk to you now
i be
filling in the gap with these
folk

how do you manage to keep in step
and move around so like one of they
young boy

get yourself a pacemaker like i

these old folk can dance good
than i can
get rid of that long
face
get one of these old fart to
show you how to do the black
bottom

do not be so standoffish

son you have not dance with you
wife all night

there be something that i always
wanted to know
tell i how do
those boy die

now who be we talking about

miss Claras boy emory to start
with
the johnsons Hocker be
another one

be not Hocker lynch

you know as well as i do that it
be make to look like he be
lynch
now who would hang someone
from a persimmon tree

what difference do it make if
it be persimmon oak tree or
huckleberry bush

tell i how come i and suzie have
to be mother and father to you
child
you never take the boy to
the park circus or anything
if we
do not take he to church he
would not have any sense of
religion

i think forcing he to go to church
when he really do not understand
be not saving he soul
when he
get old enough to make up he own
mind about religion that will be
well
it will be he intellectual
decision

be that the way you parent raised
you

why you do not want we to bring he
over

no it be that when do you have time
to be parent to he
you guy
do not pick he up until nine ten
at night
you be into yourselves
as the say go
spend some time
trying to be parent
take he to
the mountain fish
you ought
to let he get to know nature

well you be he grandfather
he
be suppose to spend some time with
you
you be suppose to show he
those woodsy thing and this and
that

junior spend time with he child

oh here we go with that

hurry up and take this picture

if it be not for the colore
people would have be the lose
tribe

remember what they use to call the

negro Raggedyass army

Hockers death almost cause a race
riot
lot of innocent people
could have be hurt behind that

strange as it may seem it might
have clear the water
sometimes
the right action come from the
wrong reason

do you want you coat
it be cold
out here

no i be too hot now

you well be careful
you will get a
stroke argue

i would not care if i drop dead if
