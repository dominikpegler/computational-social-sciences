sorry to bother you
we be just looking
for someone with fly experience

hari rama

rama rama

excuse i sir
there be be a little
problem in the cockpit and i be
wonder

the cockpit

plane where the pilot sit
but that be not
important right now
the first officer be
i will and the captain would like someone
with fly experience to help he with
the radio
do you know anything about
plane

well i fly in the war but that be a
long time ago

about it

would you go up please

would you like a little whiskey madam

can you fly this airplane and land it

surely you can not be serious


i be serious and do not call i shirley
what fly experience have you have

well i fly singleengine fighter in the
air force but this plane have four
engine
it be an entirely different kind
of fly
all together

it be an entirely different kind of fly

besides i have not touched any kind of
plane in six year


mister striker
i know nothing about
fly
all i know be this
you be the
only person on this plane who can possibly
fly it
you be the only chance we have get
McCROSKEY
tell omaha to acknowledge and standby
get every piece of emergency equipment you
can reach
alert at every mile of the way from here
to the mountain

would anyone care for a roll and coffee

inside
maybe you know the kind

it take a certain type to perform under
pressure
striker do not have it

casualty list
the upshot of it be that
he go all to piece on one particular
mission

foot level flight air speed four hundred
sixty knot course zero niner zero trim

other choice have we get
McCROSKEY
well that be the whole story rex
everything we know

as you know i fly with this man
striker during the war
he will have enough
on he mind without remembering those day
when well when thing be not so good
McCROSKEY
well right now thing be not so good
and
while we be talking there be a hundred
and thirtyeight live waiting on we for a
decision

let i tell you something steve
striker
be a topnotch squadron leader a long
time ago

but i feel be that when the go
get rough upstairs tonight ted striker
going to fold up
McCROSKEY
look rex i want you to get on the horn
and talk this guy down
you be going to
have to let he get the feel of this
airplane on the way
you will have to talk
he onto the approach
and so help i
you will have to talk he right down to the
ground

very well then
put striker on the
speaker
McCROSKEY
okay you can use the radio over there
look like i picked the wrong week to quit
drink

striker striker this be captain rex
kramer speak

yes captain kramer
read you loud and
clear

all right
it be obvious you remember i

so what do you say you and i just forget
about everything except what we have to do
now

you and i be going to bring this plane in
together

before we start i would like to say
something
i know that right now thing
must look pretty rough up there

but if you do what i tell you when i tell
you to do it there be no reason you can not
bring that plane in

let we not kid each other kramer
you know
i have never fly a bucket like this
i be
going to need all the luck there be

stand by striker
the one hope we have be to build this man
up
i have get to give he all the
confidence i can
all right striker have you ever fly a
multiengine plane before
v
o

no
never

shit
v
o

this be a goddamn waste of time
there be
no way he can land this plane
route they
into lake michigan and at least avoid
killing innocent people
McCROSKEY
grab hold of yourself
you have get to talk
they down
you be the only chance they have
get

all right striker now you listen to i
and you listen close
fly be no
different than riding a bicycle
it just
happen to be a lot hard to put baseball
card in the spoke
now if you just
follow i instruction
v
o

there be no reason why you should not
have complete confidence in you chance
to come out of this thing alive and in one
piece

first i want you to familiarize yourself
with the control
later we will run through
the land procedure

all right
now i would like you to disengage
the automatic pilot
but watch any violent
movement of the control like you used to
make in spitfire and phantom

okay i be going to unlock the automatic
pilot
v
o

just remember the control will feel very
heavy compare to a fighter
v
o

do not worry about that
it be perfectly
normal
you must watch you airspeed
closely
do not let it fall below
both
you rudder pedal and elevator trim will
have additional play due to increase
drag but you can compensate by lower
manifold pressure below
now there be
one other thing
have you someone up there
who can work the radio and leave you free
for flying

yes
the stewardess be here with i
v
o

have she take the copilots seat

the radio all yours now
and keep an eye
on that number three engine
it be running
a little hot

ceiling zero visibility one hundred foot

oh boy oh boy oh boy
McCROSKEY
rex i have decided that the good thing to
do be to foam the runway let he do a
wheelsup land
it would be a lot simple

no the risk of fire be too great
if she
start burning you write off all those
people who can not get out of there on they
own power
McCROSKEY
well that be good than writing they all
off
be you going to play god with a
hundred and live

no
belly land be not all that simple
it take a good pilot to keep from
smearin himself all over the runway
McCROSKEY
if striker have the guts to try this he
deserve the good shot we can give he
we have get to foam that runway

he only shotes with the wheel down
i have
see foam tear a mane guts out
McCROSKEY
and if striker go to piece

that be a risk we will just have to take
v
o

stay in formation
target just ahead
target should be clear it you go in low
enough
you will have to decide
you will have to decide
you will have to
decide
