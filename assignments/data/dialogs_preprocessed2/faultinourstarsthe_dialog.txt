you have a choice in this world i
believe about how to tell sad
story



on the one hand you can sugar coat
the way they do in movie and
romance novel



where villain be vanquish
and
hero be born and



beautiful people learn
beautiful lesson



and nothing be too messed up
that can not be fixed with an apology
and a peter gabriel song



i like that way as much as the next
girl believe i
it be just not the
truth



this be the truth

year

barely leaf the house

i be not depress

she read the same book over
and over

she be depress

i be not depress



the booklet and web site always
list depression as a side effect of
cancer




depression not a side effect of
cancer



it be a side effect of dying



which be what be happening to i

some day she will not even get
out of bed

i may switch you to Zoloft
or
Lexapro
and twice a day instead of
once

stage thyroid cancer



i have surgery first



then radiation



then chemo



all of which worked for a while



and then stopped working



and then i lung start filling
up with water



that should have be the end


be you ready sweetie



but it be not



the antibiotic kick in
they
drained the fluid from i lung
and in time i get well
strong



i even find myself in an
experimental trial
you know the
one that be famous in the
republic of Cancervania for not
work



it be called Phalanxifor

it worked in i
they called it
the miracle


tumor shrink i met have hardly
grow since


of course i lung still suck but
theoretically they could continue
to suck in just this way for i
dunno a while maybe

i favorite novel

stormtrooper


seriously
it be not that kind of book

sound horrible

it be not it be
kind of i bible
actually

interesting
what be it about

cancer
but not in that way trust i
the
guy who write it peter van houten
he be
well the only person i have
ever come across who seem to a
understand what it be like to be
die and b not have die

in that case
i be going to read
this horrible book with the bore
title that do not contain zomby
or stormtrooper
and in
exchange

all i ask be that you read this
brilliant and haunt novelization
of i favorite video game

you hand be cold

not so much cold as under
oxygenated

ooh hazel grace

please
it be not
like i be waiting for he to call or
anything
i just
we hung out
no
big deal


would you like to be excused



hazel grace

welcome to the sweet torture of
reading an imperial

what the be you ok



i
yeah
i be excellent

i be however with isaac




dude
hey
do support group hazel
make this good or bad

isaac
focus
on
i



how fast can you get here

isaac hazel from support group be
coming downstairs

gentle reminder
isaac be in the
midst of a psychotic episode
you look nice by the way

how you do isaac

seem isaac and monica be no
longer a go concern

oh i be sorry
do you want to talk about it


he just want to cry and play video
game

fair enough

it do not hurt to talk to he
however
if you have any sage word
of feminine advice

i actually think he response be
appropriate

pain demand to be feel


you be quoting i book

she do not want to do it after the
surgery
say she could not handle
it
i be about to lose i eyesight
and she can not handle it

i keep saying always to she
always always always
and she
just keep talking over i and not
saying it back
it be like i be
already go you know
always
be a promise
you can not break
promise

sometimes people do not understand
the promise they be making when
they make they

right sure but you keep the
promise anyway
that be what love
be
love be keeping the promise
anyway

that could be an encouragement



isaac

here we go

that be it
punch that thing

i have be wanting to call you on a
nearly minutely basis but i have
be waiting until i could form a
coherent think in re
an
imperial affliction

i can not stop think about it

i know right

the only problem be the end

it be rather abrupt

it be torture
i mean i totally get
that she die or whatever anna
but there be an unwritten contract
between author and reader and i
think ending you book in the
middle of a sentence kind of
violate that contract

but that be part of what i like
about it
it portray death
truthfully
you die in the middle
of you life in the middle of a
sentence
but i do god i do want
to know what happen to everyone
else

yeah like she mom

the dutch tulip man


Sysiphus the hamster

have you tried contact this
peter van houten

i have written letter
he be never
respond
apparently he moved to
amsterdam become a recluse
have not
published anything
do not do
interview

sad
hang on
isaac

pillow do not break

you need to break something

go to town i friend

i have be looking for a way to tell
i dad that i kinda hate
basketball
think maybe we have find
it

feel well


that be the thing about pain
it
demand to be feel

dr
maria called today
the
scan be set for the eighth

i told you support group be a good
idea

by all means

hazel grace

hello augustus

so i read it again
and i just keep
feeling like
like it be a gift
like you would given i something
important

you be welcome

on the other hand
we need
closure do not we


what we need be a sequel

yes
we need to know what happen
to anna family after she die

that be what i keep asking van
houten for in i letter

but he never write back

that be correct

because he be a recluse

Yeeeup

utterly unreachable

in total agreement
we leave on may third

wait a minute
be you only do this so i will
kiss you

because i would totally kiss you either
way

seriously
why be you do
this


because hazel grace
i find i
wish

be you out of you mind

it be too much haze
we can not
accept something like that from a
virtual stranger

he be not a stranger

really

do not be gross

it be still no i be afraid

can we at least ask dr
maria


that be out of the question

you said the scan be
encourage


the scan be encourage
we
just do not know how long it will stay
that way
what if you get sick in a
foreign country

they have doctor in amsterdam
and
cancer
someone will know what to
do



be that as it may without someone
familiar with you particular case
i can not

so you will come too

what

the geny can hook it up
they be
loaded

i

you have never be to amsterdam
have you mom




and then this happen



people talk about the courage of
cancer patient
and i do not deny
that courage




i would be poke and stabbed and
poisoned for year and still i tread
on



but make no mistake



in that moment i would have be
very very happy to die

hello

hi

you be ok hazel

would you like to see you parent

they think it be a brain tumor

it be not thank god


so what happen

the usual
fluid in the lung
prevent oxygenation
they put
that in

drained a liter and a half last
night

the good news be
no tumor
growth
no new tumor in you body

we be all so relieve

this be just a thing hazel
it be a
thing we can live with

mr
lancaster
how be she do

well thank you
much well

they will not let i in
family only

i be sorry

no i get it
will you just
will
you tell she i be here


of course i will

gus

why do not you go home get some
rest

the great news be
Phalanxifor
continue to control you tumor
growth
the not so great news be we be
still seeing serious problem with
fluid accumulation
so how should we proceed

um i feel like i be not the most
qualify person to answer that

i be talking to dr
simmons


it be a strange case
normally the
tumor start resisting the
treatment
but that have not happen
here yet


unfortunately the drug may be
worsening the edema



but if we stopped it entirely
we be likely to face even grave
danger

so we be going to do nothing


that be what we have to decide
the
truth be
very few people have
be on Phalanxifor as long as
hazel have
we do not really know the
long term effect

can not i just get like a lung
transplant or something


you would not be considered a
strong candidate for a transplant


we be trying to prevent endothelial
growth while at the same time
prevent immunosorbent

be you ready sweetie

i will not be a mom anymore


i have a question


yes hazel

can i still go to amsterdam


that would not be wise at this
juncture

why not


excuse i

why not dr
simmons


i


it would
increase some risk

so do going to the mall


yes but an airplane

they have oxygen on airplane



it be i life right


you be stage


i have this opportunity i may never
have again
if the medicine
working i do not see why


because hazel
look i do not know any other way to
say this
you be just too sick


i be sorry


we will be right outside

gus again

i be sorry gus she be asleep

incidentally thank you for dinner
last night

we buy they dinner last night

it be we pleasure

you have come a long way so
what
be it i can do for you

we have some question

Uhhuh

about what happen you know
after
the end of you book
specifically to those who anna
leaf behind
like she mom the
dutch tulip man Sisy

how familiar be you with swedish
hiphop

i would say
limit

but presumably you know Afasi och
Filthys seminal album Flacken


um

Lidewij
play Bomfalleralla
immediately


i be sorry sir
we do not speak
swedish

who the hell speak swedish
the
important thing be not what
nonsense the voice be saying but
what the voice be feeling

be you mess with we

pardon

be this some kind of performance

rudolf otto said that if you have
not encounter the numinous then
he work be not for you
and i say
to you i friend if you cannot
hear Afasi och Filthys bravadic
response to fearfulness then i
work be not for you

so anyway
when the book end
anna mom

raising a hand to silence

let we imagine that you be racing
a tortoise

the tortoise have a ten yard head
start
in the time it take you to
run ten yard the tortoise have
moved maybe one yard
and so on
forever


you be fast than the tortoise
but you can never catch he you
see you can only decrease his
lead
now certainly you can run
past the tortoise as long as you
do not contemplate the mechanic
involve but the question of how
turn out to be so complicate that
no one really solve it until
cantor proof that some infinity
be big than other infinity

i assume that answer you
question

i do not know what be going on

and yet you seem so intelligent
in print mr
water
must be all that cancer in you
brain

peter

can we please maybe talk about
anna for a sec
i mean i
understand that the story end mid
sentence because she die or she
become too sick to continue

i be not interest in talking about
that book

but that do not mean she family
and everyone she love do not have
a future right

i said i be not interest

but you promised


mr
van houten you said you would
tell we what happen and that be why
we be here
we
i need you tell
i
surely you have think about it
i mean as character

nothing happen to they
they be
fiction
they cease to exist the
moment the novel be over

they can not
again have to calm

i mean i understand
in a literary
sense
but it be impossible to
imagine some future

i can not do this
Lidewij get rid
of they please
Lidewij do not move he
turn back to hazel
i will not indulge you childish
whim
i refuse to pity you in the
manner in which you be accustom

i do not want you pity

of course you do
like all sick
kid you existence depend on it

peter

you be fate to live out you day
as the child you be when
diagnose the child who believe
there be life after a novel end
and we as adult we pity this so
we pay for you treatment for
you oxygen machine
we give you
food and water though you be
unlikely to live long enough



you be a side effect of an
evolutionary process that care
little for individual live


you be a fail experiment in
mutation

i

the red wheelbarrow by william
carlos williams
so much depend upon a red
wheel barrow glazed with rain
water beside the white
chicken



be that it

no of course not
um
what
else
so much depend upon a blue sky
cut open by the branch of the
tree
so much depend on the
transparent Gtube erupt from
the belly of the bluelipped boy

so much depend upon this observer
of the universe



one of the less bullshitty
convention of the cancer genre be
the convention known as the last
good day




this be where the victim of cancer
find himself unexpectedly with
some hour




when it seem like the
inexorable decline have suddenly
plateaue when the pain be for a
minute bearable



the problem of course be that
there be no way of knowing that you
last good day be you last good
day
at the time it be just
another decent day

um no

as well you should not

augustus waters be a self
aggrandizing bastard
but we
forgive he
we forgive he
not
because he have a heart as
figuratively good as he actual one
suck or because he get year
when he should have get more




i be assuming you have get some time
you interrupt bastard
i mean
seriously
augustus waters talk so much
that he would interrupt you at he own
funeral
and he be pretentious


sweet jesus that kid never take a
piss without ponder the
resonance of human waste
production
and he be vain
but
that come with superhuman
handsomeness


but i will say this
when the
scientist of the future show up at
i house with robot eye and they
tell i to try they on i will tell
the scientist to piss off because
i do not even want to see a world
without augustus waters


and then of course have make
i rhetorical point i will put i
robot eye on because i mean
robot eye


so anyway augustus i friend
godspeed

heart of jesus

augustus waters be the great star
cross love of i life
ours be
an epic love story and i will not be
able to get more than a sentence
into it without disappearing into a
puddle of tear
like all real love story ours
will die with we as it should
i would
hope that he would be eulogize i
because there be no one i would rather
have


i can not talk about we love story
so instead i will talk about math
i be not a mathematician but i
know this
there be infinite
number between and
there be

and
and
and an infinite
collection of other
of course
there be a big infinite set of
number between and or between
and a million
some infinity
be big than other infinity

writer we used to like taught we
that
i want more number than i be
likely to get and god i want more
number for augustus waters than he
get
but gus i love i cannot
tell you how thankful i be for we
little infinity
you give i a
forever within the numbered day
and for that i be eternally
grateful
i love you






augustus waters die eight day
later in the



when the cancer which be make
of he stopped he heart which
be also make of he



it be unbearable
the whole thing
every second bad than the last



one of the first thing they ask
you in the be to rate you pain
on a scale from to
i would be
ask this question hundreds of
time and i remember once early
on when i could not catch i breath
and it feel like i chest be on
fire and the nurse ask i to
rate the pain and though i could not
speak i held up finger



later on when i would be feeling
well the nurse come in and she
called i a fighter
you know how

because you
called a ten a nine

reason i called it a nine be
i

the great and
terrible ten
