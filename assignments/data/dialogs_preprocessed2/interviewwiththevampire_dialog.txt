have not be human for two hundred
year

what can i do to put you at ease
shall we begin like david

really where we should start do not
you think

you be not lying to i be you

why should i lie
be the year

the master
of a large plantation just south of
new orleans

childbirth

be buried less than half a year

particularly fond of looking on
crucifix

the story about stake through the
heart

the same
as you would say today
bull shit

what about coffin

coffin
coffin unfortunately
be a necessity



kill be no ordinary act
it be
the experience of another life
for certain
that night i have lost
i own life and taken another
i
be drowning in a sea of human
guilt and regret with all the
heighten sense of a vampire

yes that be you i handsome
friend
and you will look that way
till the star fall from heaven

it can not be

give it time
you be like a man who
lose a limb and still imagine he
feel pain
it will pass
and we
must sleep now
i can feel the sun
approaching

you must get into it
it be the only
safe place for you when the light
come

and if i do not

the sun will destroy the blood i have
given you
every tissue every
vein
the fire in this lantern
could do that too

do not be afraid
in moment you will
be sleep as soundly as you ever
sleep
and when you awake i will be
waiting for you and so will all
the world

you told i something early
you
said you do not have a choice
be
that true

someday i will tell you
we have a
lot of time to talk to each other
you might say
we have all the
time we shall ever need

dear god what have i do



i awake the next evening to a
different world
and i realized
there be as profound difference
between vampire as between human
being

you wealth dear louis be
inestimable
you income from
cotton alone will keep we in
comfort for a century



i sit there stare at he with
contempt
he have the soul of a
shopkeeper he be the sow ear
out of which nothing fine could be
make
i feel sadly cheated in
have he as a teacher

you will get used to kill
just
forget about that mortal coil
you will become accustom to thing
all too quickly

do you think so

you be not hungry sir

au contraire i dear
he could eat
a horse



i look at anything mortal and see
all life as precious condemn
all fruitless guilt and passion
that would let it slip through the
finger like sand



it be only as a vampire that i
could see Yvettes beauty
she fear
of i increased i desire

i will finish it yvette
now leave
we

can not you pretend you fool
do not
give the game away
we be lucky to
have such a home

pretend to drink at least

such fine crystal should not go to
waste

i know
it get cold so fast

we can live like this
off the
blood of animal

i would not call it living
i would call
it surviving
useful trick if
you be catch for a month on a ship
at sea

there be nothing in the world now
that do not hold some

fascination

yes
and i be bore with this
prattle

but we can live without taking
human life
it be possible

anything be possible
but just try
it for a week
come into new
orleans and let i show you some
real sport



this be new orleans a magical and
magnificent place to live
in which
a vampire richly dressed might
attract no more notice in the
evening than hundreds of other
exotic creature

come on mon cher
the good in the
colony
once you touch this you will
never go to any other tavern again

you think so cherie
but what if

almost feel sorry for they



lestat killed two sometimes three
a night

or i will burn you alive

the ship be sailing without we

not yet
holding she tightly louis
run



though the fire seem to spread
through the quartier i stand on
that deck until dawn fearful he
would come out again of the very
river like some monster to destroy
we both
and all the while i
think lestat we deserve you
vengeance
you give i the dark
gift
and i deliver you into the
hand of death for the second time

do he die in the fire

he be dead to we
we be free
that be all that matter



though the ship be blessedly free
of rat a strange plague
nonetheless strike it passenger



claudia and i alone seem immune
we keep to ourselves ponder the
mystery of lestat and the great
mystery of each other



we reach the mediterranean
i
wanted those water to be blue
they be black nighttime water
and how i suffer then strain
to remember the color that a young
mane sense have taken for grant
that i memory have let slip away
for eternity
it be black off the
coast of italy black off the coast
of greece europe itself be black

louis you quest be for darkness
only
this sea be not you sea
they myth of man be not you
myth
they history be not yours



we see the acropolis by moonlight
shade of grey and silver
and i
long for the brilliant white of
those marble in the hot sun of
homer



we dock at varna and search the
rural countryside of the
carpathian for what she liked to
term we kind

the quest for these old world
vampire filled i with bitterness
we search village after village
ruin after ruin and i be glad when
always we find nothing
for what
could the damned really have to say
to the damn

you find nothing

peasant rumor superstition about
garlic cross stake in the
hear all that how do you say
again
bull shit
but one of we
kind
not a whisper

no vampire in transylvania
no
count dracula

fiction i friend
the vulgar
fiction of a demented irishman
so we repaired to paris



i think the very name of paris
bring a rush of pleasure to i
that be extraordinary
i be a
creole after all and paris be the
mother of new orleans a universe
whole and entire unto herself

we be alive again
we be in
love and so euphoric be i that i
yield to she every desire

help i mon chere

how do i look

still i beautiful child

beautiful child
be that what you
still think i be

yes

why do you turn away
why do not you
look

you want i to be you daughter
forever do not you

yes

well tell i papa
what be it
like making love

you do not remember
or you never
know

it be something hurry
and
seldom savored
something acute
that be quickly lost
it be the
pale shadow of kill

but how will i ever know louis

i will never find they will i
i
own kind

have i anything in common with she
louis

or she or she or any of they

claudia you torture yourself

they be duckling that will grow
into swan
whereas i must be the
duckling forever

you be more beautiful than any of
they

should i take she louis
among she doll
make a doll of she
in turn

come claudia



for a time we have be almost
human in the sensual whirl of what
paris have to offer
but the human
delight of that city only serve
to remind she of the ageless child
she have become
i feel she pain as
i walk until i become aware that
i be be follow

claudia



so it be when i have given up the
search for vampire that a vampire
find i

clever

you mean i harm

you mean i harm

trickster
buffoon

i have search the world for an
immortal and this be what i find

one will harm you
i will not allow
it
remember i name
armand

remember what i have tell you
they will have different power
they will read you thought if you
allow it

but this can not be real
this be
nonsense

nonsense all right
but something
tell i it be going to be the
strange nonsense we have ever see

mortal mortal everywhere
and
lots of drop to drink

they be here
i know they be
listen for something that do not
make a sound

it be a vampire
it be the one i see
in rue st jacques

they use no paint
and the audience
think it be paint

how devilishly clever

she be no vampire

no
she be frighten
she do not
know where she be

i do not want to die

we be death

someone help i
please
what
have i do

this be no performance

and no one know but we

we all die
death be the one thing
you share with all those here

but i be young

death be no respecter of age
he
can come any time any place
need
i tell you what fate have in store
for you

i would take i chance
let i go
please

and if you take that chance and
live what be you fate
the
humpbacked toothless visage of old
age

this be monstrous

yes and very beautiful

just as this flesh be pink now it
will turn grey and wrinkle with
age

let i live please
i do not care

then why should you care if you die
now

and suppose death have a heart to
love and to release you
to whom
would he turn he passion
would
you pick a person from the crowd
there
person to suffer as you
suffer

oh yes take i monsieur vampire
i adore you

you wait you turn

well have you a sister a mother
a daughter you would send in you
place

we alone can give death meaning
do
you know what it mean to be loved
by death to become we bride

no pain

no pain

you beauty be a gift to we

who deserve such a gift

no pain

i have see enough of this
i loathe
it

be still

patience louis
patience

we have be searching for you for a
very long time

such a darling

monstrous

yes and very beautiful

you lip they do not move

they do but too fast for you to
see they
no magic just grace and
speed

he want you

disappointing be not it
to come so
far and find so little
jaded
ingenues amusing themselves with
make believe

we have feared we be the only
one

but how do you come into
existence

you do not want to answer
two
vampire from the new world come
to guide we into the new era as all
we love slowly rot and fade away

be you the leader of this group

if there be a leader i would be
the one

so you have the answer

ah
you have question

what be we

nothing if not vampire

who make we what we be

surely you know the one who make
you

but the one who make he who make
the one who make he the source of
all this evil

that be a picture nothing more

you mean we be not child of
satan

no

i understand
i see you in the
theatre you suffering you
sympathy for that girl
i see you
with the boy
you die when you
kill you feel you deserve to die
and you stint on nothing
but do
that make you evil
or since you
comprehend what you call goodness
do it not make you good

then there be nothing

perhaps

and perhaps this be the only real
evil left

then god do not exist

i have not spoken to he

and no vampire here have discourse
with god or the devil

none that i have ever known
i know
nothing of god or the devil i have
never see a vision nor learn a
secret that would damn or save i
soul
and as far as i know after
four hundred year i be the old
live vampire in the world

i god
so it be as i always
feared
nothing leading to
nothing

you fell too much
so much you make
i feel

the one who make you should have
told you this
the one who left the
old world for the new

he know nothing
he just do not
care

know
you mean he be

come beloved
it be time we be on
we way
i be hungry and the city
wait

so soon to go



the place be dark as we left a
darkness that confound even
claudia
and as we blunder
through it again come the thought
i have wronged lestat i have hated
he for the wrong reason

how do you wrong he

you read i thought

you said a name

name i do not want to say again

i seem to recognize it

there be but one crime among we
vampire here

you should know who be so
secretive about the vampire who
make you

boredom

it be the crime that mean death to
any vampire
to kill you own kind

aaaah
i be so afraid it be to be
born like venus out of the foam as
we be
come louis let we go

i loathe they
i can not stand the
sight of they
stupid bourgeois
parisian all dressed in black
like some private club
i have
search for they the world over
and i despise they

what danger

i can feel it from they
they want
to know who make we what become of
he
they have they rule they
idiotic rule

do you think i would let they harm
you

no you would not louis
danger
hold you to i

love hold you to i
and we be in
danger not you

love

beckon you

he want you as you want he
he be
be waiting for you
he want you
for a companion
he bide he time
that place
he find they as dull
and lifeless as we do

that be not so

do you know what he soul said to
i without saying a word
when he
put i in that trance

so you feel it too

let he go he said
let he go

be that what i should do louis
let
you go
i father
i lover

other

she be

but why

i could give you reason
she
silence
she youth
it be forbid
to make so young so helpless that

if you want to
save she send she away

then i leave too

so soon
without any of those
answer you so long for

you said there be none

but you ask the wrong question
do you know how few vampire have
the stamina for immortality
how
quickly they perish of they own
will

we can do that

you would never give up life
if
the world be reduced to one empty
cell on fragile candle you stay
alive and study it
you see too
clearly
you see too much

that be what the one who make i
said

see as the
human eye could never see they
we
would sit in the dark night after
night among nameless human
entrance with the miracle of
light
silver at first then as the
year progress in tone of
purple red and i longlost
blue



and in time part
we have become
so alike we both wanted the
certainty of loneliness once
more

soon as i smell the air i know i
be home
there be sadness there
rich almost sweet like the
fragrance of jasmine
i walk the
street savoring it like a long
lose perfume



and then on Prytania street only
block from the lafayette cemetery
i caught the scent of death and it
be not coming from the grave



the scent grow strong as i
walk
old death
scent too
faint for mortal to detect

catch in the thorny vine of
sleep Beautys castle
