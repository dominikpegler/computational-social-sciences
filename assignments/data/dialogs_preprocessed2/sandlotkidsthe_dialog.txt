everyone get that one summer when
they be a kid
a summer so perfect
that it stay with they forever
it
stay catch in time like camelot
pause that summer be like a book with
a million blank page that you get to
fill with the great story you could
ever dream up
this be a story about a legend
and
for we that summer be the one when
the legend get make


everybody sometime in they life have
meet a real live hero


they be not exactly a dime a dozen
but there be plenty of people who have
do real great thing
but hardly
anyone have ever meet a certify legend
because most of they be dead before
they get vote one

so to actually be there at the moment
one get make
well forget about
it
it never happen
almost never
to understand how it all get start
you have to go back

to the alltime hand down complete
and undisputed legend that ever live

in any language in any country in
any world
the sultan of swat
the
king of clout
the great Bambino
you have to go back to

the babe
there be never be anyone great than
the babe
and when he called he famous
full count homerun in the world
series he make sure he would live forever


and it be a good thing he become
immortal because without he what
happen that summer absolutely never


would have happen
weird thing be
before i moved to the neighborhood i
have no idea who he be
and he play
a game i know nothing about

fourteen year later after the babe
be go there be another guy who
have something to do with the legend
get make too
guy who set a
record that summer that be so awesome
some people still do not believe it

safe









Thirtyone
maury wills just steal
number thirtyone

crap
can not beat that guy
ya dufuses
why you get he in a pickle for
ya
know he be the damn pickle king
Rubba
leg for sure
truly rubba leg

game over
sixteen zip
murderer
row remains undefeated

hey
we never get we up

all you mom wear boxer




Milkmilkpee

great i be dyin a thirst and you pee
i out

ham it be not really

then switch with i

do i look stupid

i moved to the neighborhood about a
month before school let out
i be
from another state and do not have a
single friend in a thousand mile




it be a lousy way to end up the th
grade because i have zip time to make
friend before summer
and that be
about where it all start






fifth grade history man
hundred
day man
hundred day of baseball
all day everyday as much as we can
that be the good

we get all summer

we get all summer

let we play

YeahYeah
let we play

everyone but the timmons twin live
on i new block

they live in a house by the sandlot
and have the world great tree house
because they dad be a contractor



even before i know any of they i envied
that tree house

later it would become second only
to cape canaveral as a command post
for history
when i moved in that summer i would never
play baseball but it be not too
tough figure out who these guy
hero be
so after a week of
watch
i figure baseball seem
like the good way to get in with they







sorry mom

i think we agreed we would take this
apart
and not spend so much time in
here

i know but it be just nighttime

scotty have you make any friend yet

here all summer fiddling with this
stuff like you do last summer
and
the one before that
scotty look at i
i know you be
smart and i be proud of you

wrong
the babe be called the babe

guy picked on he all the time
and
when they mess with he he could not
fight back because he be just

everyone know benny be different
nobody ever vote or anything but he
be the leader


even though he seem like a regular
guy he be not
benny be special

when they would all tried out for youth
league they would all make it
but when
they find out they would have to play on
different team benny told they that
if they could not play together they
should not play at all
so they stay
together

the time we be connected
like i

and when the ham hear it he barfed up
two bag of marshmallow

liar
it be only one

so stay away from the door
you
might fall out
and do not sit on you
sleep bag
you could shit you
pants
now quiet

the legend of the beast go back a
long time
before any of we could
pick up a baseball
back to a place
called Mertles acre




the beast belong to mr
Mertle the
guy that used to own Mertles acre
junkyard
and nobody ever see he
since the day it happen






Mertles acre be a bitchin place
that have everything you could ever
imagine




and the stuff be worth a fortune
so one day mr
Mertle get he this
new pup from the pound
they be
glad to get rid of he on account of
while he would be there he would killed
three dog big than he be
that be exactly what mr
Mertle figure
he needed to protect he junkyard
because people keep stealing stuff at
night when he be not around



so he buy the beast and set he
loose in Mertles acre



the beast be still just a pup of six
month but he already weigh a
pound
and he keep gettin big




he threw the beast a trash bag full of
meat every night and just left he
alone
all alone in the whole place
by himself
to grow




and so in a few month the pup grow
into the beast
and he grow big as a
car
and he grow mean because nobody
liked he and he do not like nobody
either
and so he only have one thing on his
mind
to kill



and he do
and he liked it





the beast be the most perfect junkyard
dog that ever live
a true kill
machine
after awhile the police start get
phone call from people reporting all
the miss thief
the one the
beast have killed
it added up to
about guy



but they never find a single body
not one
some people say they all get
away and be just so scared that
they end up in insane asylum and
stuff
but we know what really happen



the beast
eat they
he eat they bone and all




the beast be good at he guarddog
job
too good
so the cop said he
have to be retired
but he do not have
to be killed or nothing on account of
there be no evidence
no bone
no tooth for dental record



the police told mr
Mertle that if
wanted to keep the beast he hadda
lock he in he backyard so he could
never get out




and that he hadda chain he up so be
in case he tried to get out to eat
child and stuff he could not







mr
Mertle ask the cop how long he
have to keep he pup chain up like a
slave



they said
until forever








and so
the beast sit there under
that leanto dreaming about the time
when he can break the chain and get
out
dream of the time when he
can chase and kill again



see man
that be why you can not go
over there
nobody ever have
nobody
ever will

one kid do but nobody ever see he
again

that be not true

yeah it be
he get eat

Yeahyeah that kid who go to get
he kite

forever

courage to peek over the fence


because when they go over they

it be weird that benny said babe ruth
be like the hercules of baseball and
then the beast name turned out to be
hercules
it be also strange that mr
Mertle
have a murderer row ball to replace
the one signed by the babe


some people might say that it be all
a coincidence
but looking back at
it now it seem like everything be
connected just like i and benny

myth as the babe
the myth of
baseball
