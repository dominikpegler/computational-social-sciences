whatever i may
or may not feel means
exceedingly little to he
now

what about i

you

i be a witness to a murder
that
seem to put i pretty high
on you friend chop list

have you go to the
police

i be sure they would
love to hear you story

i would rather hear yours

you be be foolish

i be a historian mr
taupin
only once in a lifetime do you
stare history in the face

go home

why do he want to kill you

he see i as a threat

be you




concentrate

harder

harder
you swing like an impotent
cow

go to hell

oh the boy have a mouth
now if only he have an arm

impotent cow

Muy bien

here i boy from vineyard
as sweet and smooth as a young
girl thigh

it will take less effort
as you learn

it be like to kill i first

you have a gift
one you
must protect

and what be this great
gift that cannot be see
or smelt

the fabric of life
the spark
that allow the pass of
existence from one generation
to another

if that be mean to be an ex
planation mr
Romirez from spain
i be afraid you have failed

come
enough sword play for an
afternoon



you be no match for scot mr
Romirez
we be raised as rider

point conceed mr
macleod

what be the fascinatioon
it be only
a leaf

all live thing pay dues
conor
they must be respected
for that

as they age they contribute to a
sum that be the kindling from which
all future life come
to feel it
to know it be to be in touch with
the will of every live thing

i do not think i like the sound
of that

it do not feel nearly as frighten
as it sound
but the consequence of
such feeling can be very frighten
for it give you great strength
the
strength of knowledge
the ability
to stand between the give of what
have always be to what will always
be

i feel hardly nothing

you have not be fully trained
but you will learn
and you will be
good i can feel that
you have apt
itude
this be why we friend be
so concern

but why be so concern about i

this power be divided amongst you
i and other like cut in a pie
but the cut be not equal
some
like you and he have more
much
more

and you

i be a small player
but if by
helping you i can keep that monster
from be the last then perhaps
i life have mean something

i be not ready for this

you must be
you have responsibility
you must learn the rule
you can never
attract attention to yourself never
show the side that will draw other to
you
you will always know when you be
in the presence of another
beware
but more importantly conor macleod will
be you battle against time
in the
coming year you will see kingdom rise
then rot like wheat
people will
become a transitory pathetic lot
the
only constant you will know will be
the other and the tradition they
greed and quest represent
but life
without morality without the ability
to truly taste the sweetness of wine
and love be no life at all
that be
how the other exist
nothing more
than walking corpse living only to
slaughter each other in an insane quest
to be the last
keep you soul sew
to the earth
do not become one of they

of course

you be young inexperienced
you
do not know what time can do
how
it can sap all pity all love

that be not i

with the proper tool conor a
naive man can be much more dangerous
than an evil one

conor

yes darin

hate to be bother you like this
but i mare threw a shoe

go ahead senor
i have i friend to keep i company
