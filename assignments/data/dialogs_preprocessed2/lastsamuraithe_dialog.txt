they be looking to hire real american soldier to
create the first japanese imperial army

japans get it in mind to become a civilized
country and they be will to spend what it take
to hire white expert to do the job right

sergeant Gant have already agreed to serve

with approval from washington of course

both government prefer to consider we mission
unofficial
we would be there as noncombatants

only advisor to the japanese officer
help
they with train ordinance and the like

you ought to think about it
captain
unless
you intend to take up a career in the theater

i have an agreement with the winchester
corporation i be sure these people have some
concept of what an agreement be


you be paid seven dollar for each performance
you do on average fourteen performance a
year
we will pay you dollar

year

month



june
it be impossible standing here
not to appreciate one own insignificance



here there be neither past nor future
only an
oblivion of water



and yet i ask myself will the dead follow i
across the ocean to this strange new land

after the shogun give up power the daimyos
you would call they warlord know that japan
needed a centralize government
so they ask


the hereditary emperor he highness the
enlightened meiji to lead the country

and these warlord just
give up hundreds of
year of power

economic incentive be offered
most
provincial leader see the financial benefit of
modernization

what about those that do not

to deal with those who have resist the
emperor have decided to create an army with
allegiance only to he
we considered hiring
advisor from germany but you ambassador
remind we of you experience in suppress rebellious
element in you civil war

who be we suppose to be fighting against

he name be mori Katsumoto

but that
do not quite capture it
Katsumoto once serve
the emperor but he be now a traitor who lead a
band of traitor

more story of patriotic gore

top
of he class at west point
brilliant tactician

why do he leave you army

what be a hero to do when there be no more great
battle

be that an evasive answer

Doct or swear he heart have stopped beating
but before they could bury he he come back to
life
after the war he fight the sioux the cree
and the blackfoot

that would take a year

you have press business elsewhere


the civil war begin on april
when the
rebs attacked fort sumter

probabl y begin three year early when the
supreme court decided a runaway slave have to
be return to he master

Longstreets objection and lee do not know
what to think but he let we he
so man

why

the point of a battle be to win or at least have
enough man survive to fight another day

you do not try to survive when we take you

day unknown month unknown
i continue
to live among these strange people



each day i be confounded by they strange custom
and contradiction savagery follow by
mildness




they seem to value nothing more than they
family and yet they kill defenseless wounded
man without a shade of remorse


not so fast ko

the parliament of you country have two house
why be that

to keep either one from be too powerful

do not a people need a powerful ruler to
protect they

we believe the opposite

i have a question
how do you come to speak
english

member of the council be required to study
i helped restore the emperor to the throne

so that japan could have a powerful ruler to
protect it

and now you must hate he for what he be do

he be i blood
i serve he with i life

by fighting he army


i do not fight the emperor
i fight those who
seek to influence he those who betray the soul
of i country

the emperor give this blade to i ancestor
year ago
it have be used only to defend his
sacred honor

it take many year to make a sword
it be a holy
act
samurai sword be he soul

this sword be flawed
what be this uneven line
near the edge

one man be flexible and compromise too much
to avoid conflict
another man be so fierce he
win ever y battle but so rigid he can never know
peace
man who know both be the perfect
warrior
the lame be true of a blade
one steel
bend and the other cut
and where they
meet be never perfect hold the blade up


some believe a blade be thirsty until it taste the
blood of it enemy

the crew at winchester can produce one rifle ever y
seven minute

we give up firearm two hundred year ago
it
take no courage to kill
man from half a mile
awa y
you must look into the eye of you enemy
to know who you have killed


i be not sure an artillery officer would agree

do you

i think all kill a filthy business

take a mane life be
nothing
it be he honor you
can never take awa y

in other word you have no respect for human life


what do you know of human life
you come here to kill for
money where be you family
where be you wife you son
what be you legacy

and what be yours
to rebel against the future
i fight the
south in we civil war
they leader believe they be fighting
for honor just as you do
and they people die by the thousands

and i wife be dead

mine too

tomorrow we will discuss you country wish for
dominance in the
far east


i look forward to it




march

i have never known such a disciplined
people



from the moment they wake they devote themselves
to the perfection of whatever they pursue



and yet the more time i spend here the less i understand they



everyone be polite every nuance of behavior seem to
have a great meaning and increasingly i be convince
that the low they bow the leas they mean it



and i be sure they regard i wa ys to be as confound
and unfathomable as i find theirs


gren san
please forgive
too many mind

what

mind sword mind face mind people watch too many mind
no mind

no mind

hai
no mind
you try

you majest y beg permission to approach
you humble servant be most anxious to know if he
Majest y have signed the order regarding the railroad progress

i be most impress at the wa y the blossom float
upon the air as if hold by unseen hand

you be something before you be a soldier
you
be a boy who be sad to see the leave fall and the
tree die


like those tree we be all die
the future be
an illusion we plan be an illusion we fear an illusion
we live life in every breath
eat drink fuck
now
every cup
of tea
every word we write
every blossom we hold

every life we take

life in every breath

the wa y of the
samurai




i be str uck by these people and they acceptance of fate
in a l it s variation
at a time like this they seem utterly
without sentiment
even the child have a gravity
beyond they year

would last longer
if stone

house fall
house go back easy with wood



and yet i have never see a people with more capacity
for the joy find in the simple thing of life

the emperor have requested i presence
we leave tomorrow
you will be released in tokyo



april
tomorrow we return to
civilization
as eager as i be to be among i
own kind i confess to a curious reluctance



these month have marked i and i do not fully
know yet wh y



i do know it be here that i have known i first
untroubled sleep in many year

you be alwa ys welcome in we home

domo Arrigato


you will finish it soon

if that be i destiny

the emperor send a message for you to return
to tokyo and you go

yes

even though you be in rebellion against he

against the emperor
never
i serve he
as
i have alwa ys do


i do not understand

we emperor be young and there be thing i must
sa y to he

but ever yone around he want you dead

and if the emperor desire i will take i own life at his
command


we will stop here for the night

sit captain

do you drink tea

i have have little else for some time

how be you poem coming

the truth be i be not a very
good poet
do you know wh y you be send here
to
Yoshino

to protect the railroad

why be the railroad here

so tokyo can control the whole country


you have see i province
all mountain
far from tokyo
yet the rail line must come
here

you have something they want

what do they want in i mountain

mineral
gold

there be no gold in japan

coal
for steamship

and why would steamship be so important

china

japan have nothing
china have ever ything

mine the coal to create a way station for the trip to
china
freeze the european out and japan and
america have a monopol y on the china trade

add to this the Omura zaibatsu
you know the
Zaibatus

the wealthy family


as patron of the railroad Omura own all land within
four hundred foot of ever y new rail line
as i country
grow so will he wealth
this be why you be fighting

and you will tell the emperor to stop they

i do not tell the emperor what to do

then what do you hope to accomplish

will you return to america

i have a job here

you should return to you home

why

because i do not wish you to be m y enemy again

Anshinritsumai
i wish you peace







algren

they have new weapon

the kaiser be only too happy to help

with he friend at mauser and krupp
thank god we
american still have a few tooth in we head

the ambassador and i have spent eight month
kiss Omuras ass so he will sign the damn trade
pact with we
you spent all this time living with
those savage
he be going to want to talk to you

i need a bath

and you back pay i imagine


they get they flag

see

no Morisan
we arc civilized now

i cannot touch the sacred one

you can

do you have a pleasant journey minister Katsumoto

it be uneventful


if it be not a great imposition
i desire a moment alone with
minister Katsumoto
OmuraSan

enlightened one perhaps i can be of service in a conversation
of state

so kind of you but i fear i old teacher wish to upbraid
i in private for neglect i study

you rise against i i teacher

no highness i rise against you enemy

they be i teacher i adviser like you

they advise in they own interest

the world be changing mori you have not see what
go on beyond we border the invention the science
i need man who can look outward or soon we will be
left behind and defenseless

i be sworn to defend you even to i last breath

the samurai live in the past
you cannot defend against
a future you do not understand


if i be no use then i will happily end i life

no mori
it be i wish that you rejoin the council of state
i need you voice

it be you voice that need to be hear highness
you
be a live god you can do what ever you
think be right

i be a live god only as long as i do what they
think be right

you highness may i beg forgiveness for saying
what a teacher must that such a statement be pathetic
drivel not worthy of an ignorant stable boy let alone
a young man i know to have some modest intelligence

be it possible a live god can be too afraid to make
he voice hear
tell i what to do MoriSan

you be emperor i lord not i
you must find
the wisdom for all of we


as soon as they sign the agreement they be obligate
to buy the entire weapon package from colt revol ver
to ha liwell twelvepounders
plus this particular item
you might recognize

they have be calibrate to fire round a minute
the new copper cartridge cut down on jam



may
the city i return to be immeasurabl y
changed



as though tokyo be determined to become
another new york or chicago
all in one
headlong rush

if he ask you can talk about ordnance and tactic
but remember this have to do with a lot more than
just weapon

please sit down gentleman

i assure you the samurai will not stand in the
wa y of we agreement
you be prepare to make deliver y

i be please

mr

with you emperor to make this deal come to
pass
with all due respect perhaps there be someone

someone else we should be speaking to for instance the
french
or the english

against the rebel Katsumoto

and yet you helped save he life when attack
by the ninja

i role be much less significant than you may have hear

tell i about you role in Katsumotos plan

i have none

and you sympathy

again i have none

i know you have little sympathy for colonel bagley

he be
unsympathetic

i think it be we who be inscrutable

you have gain important knowledge of Katsumotos
province he army and he rebellion
this be extremely
valuable to i


you also possess significant knowledge of m y army i
weaponry and i plan
this be extremely va uable to
Katsumoto

again you flatter i

no
i be a businessman
i recognize what be valuable
and i buy it
in this case i value you loyalt y

i do not know loyalt y be something that could be sell

then perhaps you will give it as a token of future
friendship for which as a friend i would be in you debt

then i will consider it

and i will be grateful

all righteee the leaf tomorrow
if you want a steamship you will have to wait six week
get you to frisco by the th
dollar for a
private cabin for a share or for a low berth
what can i put you down for

sir

private cabin


leave
wh y would you leave now
no white
man have ever be in you position
do you
have any idea what it will mean to have Omura
as you friend
you want land you want woman
you want boy

nathan
i wanted to leave too
for three year
you must believe i there be a majest y about
these people can you imagine what you own
country would be if it have half the drive and the
discipline and the belief and the bravery of these
ridiculous little people

whit be this

i god it be the edict

what edict

that be enough




do not be stupid

captain i have not think to see you again


i be leaving tomorrow
but before i go i need to
tell you what be going on here

you mean the Gatling gun and the howitzer
be that how you sa y it

they be about to close a trade agreement that
will bring this country more weapon than
you can imagine

yes if the emperor agree but Omura know
the emperor must be convince there be because to
need those weapon before be will sign

and you be to be the because

elegant be not it
Omura pass law sure to because
a samurai revolt create a need for the weapon
the emperor see that the weapon be needed
so he agree to the entire treaty giving you
country what it want and the Omura zaibatsu
what it want
and i country be sell to yours

today the council passed two edict
the first called for
the elimination of we traditional topknot

i know

the second banned the wear of sword

re
he sword
hand they to i will you

if you do this they will kill you


i be hard to kill

you do not know what they weapon can do
all
you man butcher
just for pride

not for pride
for the emperor

but the emperor be the one signing the agreement

he have not signed it yet

be it worth it

just for these

i cannot live without i soul
can you

minister Katsumoto you honor we


it be i honor to join again the man who be lead
japan into she glorious future

you arc perhaps unaware of this council edict
regarding the wear of sword

i read ever y edict with singular attention

yet you would bring weapon into this chamber

this chamber be protected by m y sword for four hundred
year

we need no protection
we be a nation of law now


we be a nation of whore
selling ourselves to we western
ally


do japan no longer need it patriot

who be the patriot
the man who would keep his
country trapped in the past or the man who would help
he people into the future

future with no honor

honor mean less to i than feeding we child
and
teaching they
and giving they modern medicine so
they will live



and lining you own pocket in the process

minister Katsumoto it be with great regret that i ask
you to remove you sword as this body have declared
in it edict

this sword serve the emperor and only he can
command i to remove it

ah but it be we tradition that the emperor voice be
too pure and great to be hear in such worldly
circumstance as the council of state

then with great regret i must refuse to give up i
sword

minister Katsumoto i must invite you to
accompany we soldier to Himeji castle where
you will be we honore guest
i think you will
find the surroundings there quite harmonious

brother
one day you will know what you have do
and feel what i never will
shame


think i would missed you
be you going to leave
without even saying goodbye

i have a fear of sentimental englishman

you sod
christ give we

second here

you be making a mistake i promise you
Katsumotos under house arrest Omuras make
he move he will need you more than ever

oh i goodness
how silly of i
all that
time you be with he up in those mountain

then you should get out
because Omura will
become rather impatient with anyone who be not on the team

case in point

who be they

Ronin would be m y guess
disgraced samurai
do odd job for he nib


what do they want from i

to make sure you be on the side of god and
country or to make sure you get the hell out

Omura want i to train his
personal guard

why do you
think that be


could it be i nose be not permanently lodge up
he ass

gentleman

Omura you have a lovel y home
it must be very old

nothing be old in japan ever ything be ancient

but the view be pleasant

investment protocol for coal

about you


an honor
i have follow you activity with

assure we success


what do you mean

Katsumoto will rejoin he kinsman
they will fight
we will destroy they with you new weapon

what if he just go off to the mountain and
become a damn sheepherder or some such

you still do not understand we
Katsumoto can
do nothing but fight
it be he role in the drama
he must act out he destiny
he know it

you trust a lot in destiny

this story be written year ago
from the first
sight of you warship in we harbor
it be a l inevitable



june
yesterday i passed the field where
Zebulon Gant be killed by the man with whom
i now ride



i be beset by irony trained to fight rebel
now i be one
and yet ask mysel f
can a man
be reborn



and if so what would he make of it


i be prepared to die in Omuras castle
and
yet here i be
i cannot help but ask why be
you send into i life
what be the lesson you
be mean to give i

maybe that neither of we be as smart as we
thought

you
be not whistlin dixie

he give he life to save we
he die bravel y

thank you AlgrenSan


will you fight the white man

if they come here yes

why

because they come to destroy what i have come to love

the wa y of samurai be difficult for child
he
miss he father

and he be angry because i be the because of that

no
he it angry because he fear you will die as well

Higen

i father taught i it be glorious to die in battle

that be what he believe

i would be afraid to die in battle

so would i


but you have be in many battle

and i be always afraid

i do not want you to go

Algrensan

they be corn

i call it five thousand troop
they will come in
wave of about a thousand a few minute between
each wave


german formation have the infantry staggered
with on y light flank
they will come straight on
with rifle and fix bayonet
Mausers be only
accurate to about yard
they will look to
overthrow we

colonel

captain

sir the imperial
army of japan demand you surrender
if you
and you fellow lay down you arm you will
not be harm

that be not possible
as Omura know

captain algren we will show no quarter
you
ride against we and you be the same as they be

i take that as a compliment colonel
i will look for you on the field

they have the howitzer

how many

about a dozen


man could get lost up there
build an army
hold out a very long time

Algrensan
have you see what happen to the
village that stand in the way of the railroad

that be what will happen to i village if we do
not stand and fight
no
we serve the emperor here

by dying

perhaps

at least make it battle not a suicide

and what would that accomplish

it might give you one more day
one more
fine day like this




july
for so long now i have managed
to convince myself that there be nothing worth
believe in



certainly nothing worth dying for



now i be not so sure



and so for the first time in i life i be truly
afraid
not of dying
but of losing something
worth living for

what be it


the kenbu
he dance of death

Algrensan will you come with i


if you wear this it will honor we
kimono
she hand move gracefull y around he body never quite touch

so m y hair will have a please scent when i
meet i ancestor

you do not do this

i studied war at a place called west point
they
taught we about a battle called thermopylae
three hundred brave warrior held off the king
of Persias army of a million man
for two da ys
they make they pay so dearly that the king lost
all appetite for far invasion
i have some thought about the battle tomorrow

do you really think we can defeat they


i sure as hell want to find out

you believe a man can change he destiny

no
but i think a man cannot know he destiny
he can only do what he can until he destiny be
revealed

what do it say

i belong to the warrior in whom the old way
have joined the new


return


if that be i destiny
Anshinritsumai
i
wish you peace


Anshinritsumai

warrior at thermopylae

what the hell


it seem Katsumoto will resist he destiny
send in the second wave
two division

how long

they need to regroup and report we position
then
they will come hard

it be sad to see brave man die without face
you cannot
tell one warrior from another

they be not warrior
they be soldier
it be a
modern army

not i world anymore


classic ambush
Sonofabitcb be use
welt point tactic

they be all perfect

will usher in an era of unprecedented prosperity
and cooperation between we two great nation

highness if we could just conclude the matter
at hand

strength of the samurai will be with you alwa ys

en ightcned one we all weep for he loss but
the future of we country lie in

i ancestor have ruled japan for year
and for all that time we have sleep
during i
sleep i have dream
i dream of a unify
japan
of a country strong and independent and
modern
and now we be awake
we have railroad and
cannon and western clthe
but we cannot
forget who we be
or where we come from

ambassador Swanbeck i have conclude that you treaty
be not in the good interest of i people

sir if i may

you may not
from this moment on economic investment
from ever y nation will be considered equally


this be an outrage

enlightened one we should discuss this

Omura do you know we northern island

there be a small one called Taraku
rock in the sea
there be nothing there but crab who have be known
to tear a sleep man apart
i have have a small house
constructed on the island
you will go there now and
await we summons

sir

i hereby seize you family asset and present they
as i gift to the people

if you shame be too unbearable
i offer you
this sword

the samurai be not a man now
he be an idea
tell i how he die

i will tell you how he live



and so the day of the samurai have end



and in the year to come the rising sun of imperial japan
would fl y in triumph over korea over russia even over
china
nation like man it be sometimes say have
they own destiny
