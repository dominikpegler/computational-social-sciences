must be another johnson then
be
flying so many scientist out here

who be everyone

physicist mathematician
geologist you name it

geologist
at a plane crash

strange be not it
in the middle of
the ocean no less

what the hell would a geologist be
do at a plane crash

any other bag dr
johnson

just that
careful it be heavy

no other equipment
scientific
instrument

no they do not say

this way sir

captain barnes want to see you
right away sir

captain who

barnes
he be very eager to meet you

i do not know i have
friend in washington

come with i
the team already
waiting

what team

what have you be tell so far

the usual
plane crash
Survivers
unknown
routine stuff really

anything else

nothing else

captain barnes
dr
johnson

hello

you talk to any reporter
any
press

press
no i have not

good
Securitys be we big
worry
now that you be here we can
shut this thing down tight

from what
what be with all the
security

well we do not have all the fact
yet

we be moving fast considering the
storm

storm
what storm

cyclone on it be way in
i
think they would have tell you on
the phone

they do not tell i anything

we have have diver working around the
clock
take a look at this

how deep be he

thousand foot

thousand
an airplane crash into
a thousand foot of water i do not
want to sound pessimistic here but
i assume there be no survivor

survivor
no i would not think so

then why be i here

what

what do you need i for

what crashed be not an airplane dr
johnson
it be a bit large than
that

bring up the grid would you

what be it
military spacecraft
like a shuttle or satellite

something like that
that do not surprise you

not really no
something of the
military crash in the ocean it
explain why there be nothing on
the news why you have keep everything
a secret
when do it crash

as best we can estimate it crashed
four hundred year ago

four hundred
you be kidding right

see this
coral
geologist measured
the coral growth on top of the craft
to be over five meter thick

geologist

coral grow at a rate of two and a
half centimeters a year

wait a second

dating the crash at least that
old

hold on

maybe old

there be get to be some mistake
here a four hundred year old
military spacecraft
there be no such
thing
we space program be not even
forty year old

extraordinary be not it

it be impossible

i be afraid it be dr
johnson
because it be sitting on the bottom
of we ocean floor

off the record i do not mind telling
you this thing scare the shit out
of i

it do not make any sense

we think it might
that be why we
bring you here
we have assembled
you team they be waiting for we
now

what team

the one you recommended
in the
report you write for the bush
administration

report
Nobodys mention that
in year
you mean someone actually
read it

you report become we bible down
here dr
johnson
we have be
carrying out each of you
recommendation one by one to
the small detail

but sir i do not understand
this
report these recommendation
they be for an encounter with extra
terrestrial life



how big be this spacecraft



of what we be able to measure
roughly twentysix hundred foot



half a mile long

the wing dimension alone be large
that any aircraft we have see

how much damage

to the craft
none
not a scratch

right
so you be saying it survive
a high speed impact with water
without a scratch

i be not saying anything harry i be
just state the fact
the outer metal be make of a
titanium alloy build into an epoxy
resin honeycomb
the necessary
technology to bond this type of
metal have never be invent

never invent

in basic english what do all this
mean

basic english
there be no way this
spacecraft be constructed on we
planet

five year
no phone call
what be
i a leper

beth look can i trust you with a
little secret

i love secret

that report everybody patting
i on the back about

i have read it twice norman
it be
brilliant

it be bullshit
the report a joke

that be quite a secret

i spent a week reading sagan and
watch rerun of the twilight
zone
seriously
i be just trying
to pay the mortgage on i house i
have no idea

do yourself a favor norman
be you
listening
do not tell anyone what
you just told i

mon beth that report like
the blind leading the blind

because when we get down there

wait down where

to the spacecraft
to investigate

underwater

what do you expect
for they to
bring it up here

we can not go down there
we be not
prepare
that deep
that take
year of train beth
we be just
scientist
lab scietists
we wear
tie and lab coat to work not
oxygen tank

well you must have realized the
chance an encounter like this would
happen here
in the ocean
percent of the earth surface be
water norman
that be first grade
geography

it never occur to i

well let we pray that be the only
mistake you make
have you say
anything to barnes about this

the time have never seem quite
right

just keep you mouth shut alright
this could mean everything to we
career you know that
do not
jeopardize this

what be you threatening i

i do not know you but i will be honest
with you
i do not like this
i do not
like any of this
especially the
water

seasick
marine biologist

i do not belong here
none of we
belong here
look at that

make you feel pretty small do not
it

it scare the shit out of i





we descent will take minute
descend at a speed of foot per
minute



pressure adjustment will because the
sub to lurch at time but do not be
alarm
it be perfectly normal



the subas interior atmosphere will
experience moisture as we descend
and the temperature will drop
rapidly
just relax and remain
seated during the descent



we have clear from the base

arthur

arthur
you alright

open the hatch door please

captain open the hatch door please
the hatch door captain
open it
please



calm down dr
levine

let i out captain
open the door



please dr
levine

sit down dr
levine
you be in a
military operation now

you civil right have be
overridden

open it captain

dr
levine please
return to you
seat

open the fuck door



anybody else

Whatd you say to he

to who
arthur
nothing
nothing
that norman do not already know

what do norman already know

norman think we should not be going
down
think it be a mistake

she told i what you said norman

what be it harry

just one of normans many secret



one moment for pressurize

they pressurize we with helium

what be wrong with oxygen

it be a corrosive gas
on earth it
make a halfeaten apple turn brown
and put the ugly iron rust on an
oldsmobile
at a pressure this low
oxygen become toxic
breathe it
down here and it will do to you dick
what it do to the oldsmobile

important safety tip
thanks
captain

captain the diver have the airlock
mounted at the door
the robot be
now in position to enter the
spacecraft

robot
what robot

edmunds bring up the robot camera
feed

captain you know i really
appreciate you haul we a thousand
foot below sea level so we can watch
this historical event on television

nobody go inside until we know
what be
inside

can you open that panel

work on it now sir

i would like it noted in the report that
i think we should be do this
ourselves
making a manned entry

i would also like it noted

duly noted ted
edmunds try use
suction

it be not sucking sir

thank you i can see that
try
something else

we do not have anything else to try
sir

well shit find something do
something
make something up

what about a crowbar

what
about
a crowbar

what if we go out there you know
wedge a crowbar in the door and pry
the thing open

pry the thing open
what be we
neanderthals

all that banging and pounding
i
do not know
we should think about
making a good first impression

for who
the fish

for whoever in that thing

or whatever in that thing

norman what do you think

i
well i do not really
i
mean you could
you know you
could make a real solid case
a
crowbar

i do not know

i be secure enough with that

be we all i mean be it
necessary for all of we to go
out
there

nothing to be nervous about
these
suit be wired and electrically
heated
each equip with an alarm
that trigger automatically if life
support sustems go below optimum

it be just like swimming norman
you know how to swim do not you

you be not afraid of the water be
you norman

be not there a psychological term for
that dr
johnson

yeah
drown

you be next norman

no
go ahead
really
lady first

such a gentleman when you be scare
shitless

go ahead
lady first

no why do not

mon

wait a second i

geez mon alright
give i a
minute
let i get i bearing

mon norman

look would you




the switch be on you waist



look at that thing

easy ted we be not mining gold

give i some room here will you
back
off
give i some space

look alot like an airplane door
do not it

alot like
you know i notice it
before but i do not

Shutup ted
you do not notice shit
keep hammer

you want i to try

you be a year old shrink what
be you going to do

give he the hammer ted

what be it you back give out

what be it norman

take a look

it be chipped

chipped
the door
how can it be
chipped

i do not know how it can be chipped
but it be chipped

i think you said there be not any
damage do in the crash

i do

then how can it be chipped

there be heat coming the door

back away then

wait a minute

i said back away

would you wait a minute

ted get she away from the door

what be you going to do shoot
she

get she away

look at this

what be it

some sort of lead or something

radiation shield you think

foot and a half thick
that would
withstand a helluva lot of
radiation

hold on

what be it

any of you get ahead of i walk
this far up

no
i do not think so

well think
because there be
footprint here that be not mine

well they be not mine

calm down alright
they get to be
somebody here
let we stay
together please


it be empty
why would someone build a
ship like this

you would have to ask they

alright beth do that thing you do
before

how about i just press the button

or just
press the button

strange be not it
you know how
it would have a button

earth do not have a patent on
button ted

still make a note i recognized that

what be wrong

what do you make of this

what the hell

english

that be right

i do not get it

it do not make any sense

you do not think it do
i think
it be rather obvious

be it some sort of joke
like one of
those hoax

spacecraft half a mile long
with tonne of coral on top of
it
someone go to a lot of
trouble
try again

but it be impossible

be it

why would this ship carry
instruction in english

think about it

unless this alien spacecraft be
you know somehow present
itself to american in a way that
would make we feel comfortable

year ago
i be sure christopher
columbus would have loved these
accomodations

good theory ted

well what be you theory

i be a woman
i do not theorize
i
only deal with fact

all the fact you need be right in
front of you

give i a minute here
i think i have
get it

do you

if it be an alien spacecraft

save you breath
it be not an alien
spacecraft

then what be it

it be an american spacecraft

an american spacecraft
half a mile
long
and bury year
yeah
good theory harry

it be be obvious from the start
have not it captain
that be why all
the secrecy why no one be tell
about it

we have considered it

consider what
that it be american
how would you think it be american

the chip in the door

we take a weeny little wedge bang
on it a couple of time and bust
off a chunk of the metal
yet any
spacecraft even at a low
velocity say mile an hour
crash into the water it be going to
be like hitting concrete it would
crumple like paper
but there be not
a dent to be see anywhere
not even
a scratch

mean

mean it do not land in the water

please
it must have fly here

it do not fly here
it
arrive
here

arrive
from where

not where
when
year ago
from
we future

time travel
i always think it be
one of those myth
like santas
reindeer

what would we be working on in the
future that would make we want to
come back

maybe we do not want to come back

what be you looking for

light switch
button opened that
door the craft run on some sort
of power

what be that noise

sound a little like water

norman

get this thing off i

i think the chair think you want to
fly this thing


nice work norman

whatever i can do to help

flight recorder
we future be
about to be see in we present


two thousandforty seven
year in we future

unknown entry event

what be that cluster of star there
in the center

we answer

to what

time travel
black hole



ted
captain



yes harry



we know how this craft get here
where it be be



so do we
and it seem to have
picked up something on it be travel

pick up something
what be it



i do not know
but it be something
alien


this answer one of we question

which one
let i get the list out

this spacecraft be design to pick
thing up
they see thing they want
these claw go out and bring it
in
they come across this
this
sphere
find it interesting
curious
they draw it inside to take
back home

but on the way home they miss they
turn go too far into the past

we present

but what do it do
this
sphere

maybe it be a message of some sort
you know
see this red here

look like a design some write
maybe
maybe it be send to meet the
spacecraft with a message

look closely
that be not writing
those be groove

no
they do not represent a message
they be not decorative at all
they
have another purpose entirely

what

to conceal a small break in the
surface of the sphere

break for what

it be definitely something alien
another civilization yes sir
well we do not know yet but we
think we have find a door

so how do we get it open

ted seem to have some idea

maybe we should not

what

if it be alien maybe we should not
try to open it at all

man be man all he know be man and
all he can think of be what he
know
the anthropomorphic problem
good norman

the what

i mention it in i report
do not
you read the report

everything ever written about extra
terrestial life imagine that life
be essentially human
if it do not
look human it be a reptile or a big
insect or something have human
value human understand

so
what be the problem

it be nonsense
there be enough
difference between we own species
to prove that

take politics we view on
abortion the death penalty

cannibalism to be extreme
and now
we be talking about a new life form
they value and ethics may be
incomprehensible

like thou shall not kill

or maybe it can not
be
killed

you mean what be in that thing be
immortal

i do not know
that be the point

everything can be killed

not everything
even on earth
take
yeast

yeast
thank you beth but i do not
think we be going to open it up and
find a loaf of bread

and we be just talking about three
dimensional creature
what if it be
five or six or sevendimensional
so
dimensional that we could not even
see it to kill it

good point
i do not know what you be
talking about but good point

or it could contain some great
benefit to we some astonishing new
idea or technology to help mankind

it could
but the odds of it be
any use to we be against it

you do not know that

let we say whoever make this thing be
a thousand year ahead of we just
like we be to say medieval
europe
suppose you go back to
medieval europe with a set
there
would not be any place to plug it in

just tell i bad case
bad case
of what we might find

it could breathe in air and exhale
cyanide gas

disrupt we brain wave interfere
with we ability to think

produce radioactive waste and
disintegrate we into nothing



you realize norman that we be all
going to die

do not be so optomistic harry

i be completely serious
there be
something very important missing
from that spacecraft
you know what
that be

not a clue

sign that the builder know time
travel through a black hole be
possible

i do not follow you

on that flight recorder they called
the black hole an unknown entry
event
they do not know what a
black hole be
fifty year from
now man be going to build that
ship in a very tentative
experimental way with no knowledge
that time travel through a black
hole be possible

so what

so
we know
we know it go through a black
hole
we see it
norman when we would
get to the surface we would tell
someone about the black hole
would not we
it would go in some report
like some big discovery
so in fifty
year when they build that ship
they would make precaution for a black
hole
but they do not
the called it an
unknown entry event

mean we be never going to get the
chance to tell anyone

mean we be never going to get to the
surface alive
to tell anyone

i can not believe that harry

give i another explanation

i can not
if i have a minute to think
maybe but i know you be wrong

be i

look we be under a lot of
pressure we be tire you be not
think straight

you mean you think i be cracking

no
i do not say that

then what norman

it be what be in that sphere be not
it harry
whatever you think be in
that thing you think it be going
to kill you

curious be not it
what be inside
before i die i would sure like to open
it and see

what cause it

nothing
i do not know
everything
be normal
no change at all

when do it happen

second ago
here

let i see that again

i would sure like to open it and see



do not get hysterical norman

i be telling you harrys lost it
he be saying there be a deathwish out
for each of we

look the ship be clearing out
they be taking we topside in a
matter of minute
someone can check
he out there if it be that imprtant

all i be saying be someone should
keep an eye on he

just worry about yourself

can i stay sir
i be will to risk
it
i be
after what we just
witness

what
no i know they be
civilian


i said send the sub down damn
it

do you hear i sir because

ted shut up
be you packed
ready
to go
i want everyone pack
now

harrys miss

what do you mean he be miss

he be miss
he be go
he left

he be here somewhere
find he
the
subas on it be way
go
mon

how can he be miss

sir about leaving

we be on the bottom of the fuck
ocean he can not just walk outside

oh i gosh

give i a report i want



lady and gentleman

who be that
where be that come
from

a sudden



when do it come across

minute ago
harrys trying to
decode it in he room now

where be it coming from

no idea
we have no surface support
it transmitted too fast to be coming
from underwater

be it coming from we own computer

harry think it be some sort of
discharge from we own system but
i have see it discharge before and
it do not look anything like this

get anywhere with those

there be some sort of pattern here
it will take a minute

have you look outside
jellyfish
everywhere
i hate jellyfish
harry what happen in the
cafeteria

do not do this
do not psychoanalyze
i
i hate squid
period
just like
you hate jellyfish

you said something to i before
about how we be all going to die

do i

you do not remember that

i do not remember much
it be like i
memory be on the tip of i tongue
but i can not taste any of it
funny
i sense be much keen though
pure
hear seeing smell
like i can smell you sheet
norman
you tried to wash it out
early but i can still smell the
urine
do not worry i be not going to tell
the other
it be normal really
be not it
in a crisis
the stress
the panic

fletcher
what be you do out
there



they be like pink snow sir
sticky

she say jellyfish be a delicacy
you know i never know that

get out of there
i do not want anyone
going anywhere outside understood



they be warm
i can feel the heat on
i leg

fletcher i want you back here


what happen to you inside that
sphere harry

why
do someone else want to go
inside




i can not see they be smear the
faceplate
i arm
the fabric

fletcher get away from there



it be burn

get out of there



i can not see

fletcher
now



i can not

nobody move

but she be

nobody move



they be eating through
somebody



what be this beth
you taking
valium

sedative
whatever i mood call
for

where do this come from

the library

we have a library

bad one
it be the only book in
there
norman come here look at
this

no thank you
i hate jellyfish

when i be six i young
brother and i we go swimming in
the pacific
at i mother beach
house
we both feel stinging and
when we come out of the water he
be wearing jellyfish head to toe
kill he

i gosh norman

yeah it be awful

what about you
what happen to
you

i
well i be wrapped in seaweed
it itch for a while but i
survive
beth do you find it
curious that
we be seeing all this life down
here
nothing and then these
enormous flock of squid
then
jellyfish

normally i would say no
Everythings
quiet now no ship no diver no
electricity
make sense
but what be
curious be these be not normal
jellyfish

what do you mean not normal

they have six tentacle
new
species
and the squid too
they have
no stomach

wait a minute

what

you know about the squid not be
normal
before fletcher go out
there

yeah why

and you do not tell anyone

what
why

beth

i mean i be not
i be not
absolutely sure if
they

they be or they be not
which be
it

what
wait
do not
why be
you

beth

nobody said
norman
what
why
be you looking at i like that

beth

i do not do anything wrong
i do not
mean

beth

you would not go and tell the other
would you

i hate this place norman
i want
out



i be not paranoid
i know beth
she
can be drastic

how drastic

you do not want to know

i think i do

while back beth and i we
work at the same university
she
be assisting a chemist there i
forget he name do research
experiment
she be also live
with he
yeah i know
and when she finished
she work he kick she out broke
off the relationship and published
five paper all she work
without any thank you or
acknowledgement

she should have known well

she put a razor to she wrist a day
later

when be this

i think
she tried again five
year ago
i think you should know

so you know this when you write you
report

at the time i do not know i think
putting she on the list it might
help she career catch she a
break

you knowingly recommended a woman
with suicidal tendency for a
government operation

wait a second

and then bring she down here

i do not know it would come to
this

without a cautionary word to
anyone
you know ted said something to i
early
i think he be right
he
said when you get a guy who if
he be not here he would be standing
in the unemployment line you get to
question if you get the right guy



it be the same as before but the
space different now
it be
definitely nonrandom
see

it be a single sequence repeated over
and over

we be all very proud of you harry
but what the hell be it

maybe it be a message

from what

the sphere
maybe the sphere

we be not hook up to the sphere

well if it be a discharge

it be not a discharge
right
edmunds
you said before right
so
it be get to be a message

from the sphere

what be inside the sphere

if it be a message it be probably a
substitution code
i will work on it

yeah i will work on it too

you do that

he be manic norman
you know that
this reliance on harry be misplace
you hear i
totally misplace
he be
overlook thing
obvious thing

like what

it be not some fuck substitution
code it be a direct visual
representation

you mean a picture

take a look
i rearrange the
number
put they up to the light
go ahead
squint at it

i do not see anything

squint harder

please ted

hand he another
printout
try this one

this be like nursery school

do not you see it
it be a picture of
the creature

the creature

inside the sphere
look that be the
vertical torso three leg two
arm
there be no head so i be
guessing the creature head be
locate within the torso itself you
know

well how about we wait and see what
harry come up with

sure why not
give he the trophy
that pretentious son of a bitch
you
hear he norman
all that someone
go to a lot of trouble try again
bullshit
and impotent
where do
he get off saying i be impotent
he be
a fucking selfrighteous little
prick


i ask myself why would the
sphere be use a code
if you be
trying to communicate why use a
code

see
no code
Whatd i say

code be for
hide
information
so
it be making a mistake
it be making a
code without intend to
i figure
it be probably substitute number
for letter
then i begin to wonder
what an alien intelligence would
make of we keyboard
and since
we be get spiral i imagined
the keyboard as a spiral
so i
translate it

that be brilliant

spiral out of the center you
see
be one be two be
three and so on
when i get the
message

what be the message

i have to tell you
it be strange

how do you mean strange

hello
how be you
i be fine
what
be you name
i name be jerry



he translated it wrong
i name be
jerry
it be like see spot run


the message do not show a lack of
intelligence
it be smart
it be
approaching we in a simple way
like
you would a dog
holding out you
hand letting it sniff get used to
you

what be i a dog now

edmunds get in here
i need you for
this

in a minute sir

i want a name
real name
this
thing full name rank and serial
number

captain i personally feel we should
ask much more substantive
question

i be not going to explain in some damn
report that one person die in a
deepsat expedition so we could meet
an alien named jerry

on the keyboard
typing
first we have to see if he will talk
at all

okay Jerrys talking

Whatd you say

we be friend

cut the friend crap get a name

yes
good
now let we see if it will
switch over to english letter

it be not talking it be mimick

give he a chance
he be speaking we
language not the other way around

good idea ted

thank you

what be he do

ignorant
the thing ignorant

it be not ignorant

maybe it be
pretend
to be
ignorant

be you enjoy yourself harry
because i do not know what the hell
you be do

he understand i fine

well he be polite

unless it be an act

why should it be an act

mexico
where do he get mexico

he do not wait for an answer

who say it be a he

not now beth
please
i want to
know who we be talking to before we
start talking
where be edmunds

she be not going to know sir

ask he
mon
say something

hell that mean
we be what

we have to teach he plural

what

he be saying take i to you
leader
he want to know who be in
charge

i be in charge

with an o
harold with an o

what you want i to retype it

from where you begin
that be not
even good english

what be that a planet

great okay
ask he about his
weapon

that be smart
let we talk about gun
and violence

you do not think weapon be
important

i think we should be careful
consider he emotional response

you want to put he on you couch
norman
grill he about his
childhood

when he use a phrase like i be
happy i think we should think
twice about what we ask he

jerry can you understand what we be
saying

jerry can you read we mind

edmunds i want you in here
now

jerry be you there

we should not talk here
shut it off

we would like to talk alone

and we enjoy talking with you

we would like to talk with you more
we
admire you talent and you great
power and understand

and in you great understand you
know that we be entity who must
talk in private with each other

we be not afraid we be
uncomfortable

not at all we enjoy you very much
but we need to talk alone without
you listening

thank you

jerry

jerry
be you still there

jerry

edmunds
get in here
i want to know
exactly how this be be
transmitted

she be not going to know

she wire this system

if the technology of that sphere be
advanced enough the way it
function be going to appear to we like
magic

do not give i that psychology
bullshit norman
psychology be not a
science it be superstition
it be a
bunch of soft subjective theory
without any hard data to back it up
with an intellect like this
emotion do not mean shit

it be like showing leonardo da vinci
a laptop computer
he would run
screaming witchcraft
and you
could not explain it to he either
modem microchip particle
physics

edmunds

do not make stuff up these emotional
theory just so you can feel
important here

frankly ted i would be much happy if
jerry be just a cold emotionless
intellect

why be that

edmunds

because if jerry be powerful and
also emotional

damn it edmunds

it raise a very serious
question
what happen if jerry
get mad



edmunds
can you copy



edmunds

coast be clear

norman you suit it be leaking

norman
look at this

she flesh have be macerated
chew
i have never see a bite like
this before

i can not feel she bone
she be like a
sponge

she be crushed
feel she skin
it be like sandpaper

what could have do this

what be that

the sensor be picking up something
outside

what

it will not register
it be too big to
image

too big

norman

what be they

egg



you people need to hurry back
the
sensor have activate
i do not
think you be alone out there

what be it

barnes do not know
could not get a
read

have harry spoken with jerry

not that i know of
why

jerry

jerry be you there

you think jerry have something to do
with what killed edmunds
with
what be out there

i be not sure

look at the coat here it be
definitely marine invertebrate

well until we know exactly what it
be nobody go outside understood

what be edmunds do outside

reset the sub

what sub

in the dome hanger
all we tape
be transferred to the sub
it be on
a hour timer
if someone do not
reset the delay button the sub
ascend to the surface with the
tape

what for

if something should happen to we
the navy will at least have partial
record of what happen

at least we obituary will be
accurate
that be reassure

what be it

i be not sure
i have never see
anything like it

you be a fuck biochemist be not
you
can not you tell we something

he lie to we
he left we down
here

mon beth
do not make this
personal
he told i himself they
be taking we back

yeah he
tell
you
think
what be
barnes do before they cut that
cable loose
he be on the phone
except that cable be a thousand foot
long norman
they would have broken
off communication with we four five
minute before they clear out

so what

so who be barnes talking to at the
last minute
nobody

you be jumping to conclusion beth
do not get work up

fuck you norman
it be right here

although advise of risk all
personnel elect to remain down for
duration of storm to continue
investigation of alien sphere and
associate spacecraft
signed
barnes


where do you get this

in edmunds thing

you go through edmunds thing

he be not just a navy captain he
work for the fuck pentagon

calm down beth
alright

do not tell i to calm down

it be do alright
it be over
and
there be not a damn thing we can do
about it now okay

you said something to he do not
you

what

you told he about i

beth

you do do not you

do not do this

you bastard

beth i do not
hold it together
alright

yeah okay
sure norman

beth

no i should stay calm
like you
say
right norman
stay calm

fletcher and edmunds be dead
norman
and the only one we can
trust to run this place be a fuck
liar



i do not want you talking to jerry

but sir i think it be imperative
i
think the message the animal
we have see what killed edmunds the
read you get early i think
they be all related

jerry be not hostile norman
he said
early we be he friend

of course he do
he be be isloated
for year
he want someone to
talk to
look you put a human being
in isolation for four day they can
become neurotic sometimes
psychotic
we be talking about
year here
an alien that show
emotional response
i think we need
to address he before he react
**further/far

you think he killed edmunds

yes i do
whatever out there i
think be he response to we refuse
to talk to he early

bullshit
what be out there be not
alien
it be an animal

maybe so
but i think we need to ask
jerry about it

no
i think we should shut down the
communication line inside the
habitat
he might be listening now

i think he already be

nice work captain sir

shut up beth
i do not want to hear
it

jerry we do not want to ignore you

we do not

jerry



jerry

jerry

direction east come

what be that

go active

jerry

it look like a tentacle
of a
squid

squid
the size of a whale
i
do not think so
target acquired
sixty yard

what if it attack

fifty yard and closing

what do we use for defense

we be a habitat
not a castle
the
only defense we have be high
voltage

high voltage

it send volt throughout the
cylinder surface
but we have never
used it underwater before

forty yard

but you have tested it

sure
each time it start fire
inside the habitat

thirty yard

what be you saying we can not stop
what be out there

what the hell
it shut we down

jerry
please
stop this

ted go into the control room
listen for i instruction

why can not i
what the hell be
going on here

why can not you
believe i



what be it norman
norman

norman



what


i could never read that
far


we fisherman frequently see some
that be more than four foot long
some skeleton of squid

squid


accord to calculation of
some naturalist one of these
animal only six foot long would
have tentacle foot long
that
would make a formidable monster


norman


norman what be it



after the attack a navy guy wake i
up i do not know i think he
be an illusion
but i checked the
tape and jerry said he manifest
he

manifest

create
bring to life
i do not
know
but at the end jerry said
stop calling i jerry
and

he translated it wrong

what

hello
how be you
i be fine
what
be you name
i name be harry




remember when we first speak to
jerry barnes keep asking for
Jerrys real name
but harry never
would
he do not because he be
afraid the screen would say harry
instead of jerry
we be not talking
to an alien intelligence when we
talk to jerry we be talking to
harry
or a part of harry



what do you mean a part of harry

when do the message start
the
animal outside start showing up
after harry come out of the sphere

you think in the sphere

he acquired some sort of power

power to manifest thing

but how

i do not know

how can the sphere do that

i do not know beth
i be not the
fuck alien that build the thing
but it can
when harry come out of
the sphere he mumbled something
about page
how he would never
read that far he be too scare
to
then you find the book
remember in you lab
then in the
cafeteria and page talk about
a giant squid

which i told barnes be attack

it be he fear
the squid
he be
manifest he fear
making they
real

but why be he do it

he must not realize he be
like the
navy crewman harry be sleeping
then
he must have manifest his
dream

he dream
you can not control you
dream
and you can not control you
fear can you

no
i mean we have always believe we
can think anything we want without
consequence
you ever read the
bible
it talk about we sinful nature
you know
i mean we can think and
believe and desire whatever we
want but there be a part of we a
shadow side as jung called it
that can not be controlled
it be evil
it be inside we
it be what we be




and that be the part of harry that be
be manifest



must be
and if it be it be a part
of he not even he can control

look like some sort of code

why would harry go back to use a
code



you mean jerry do not you

jerry
right
i said jerry do not
i

that be a hell of a mistake to make
beth

i be sorry
slip of the tongue

make that confusion

there be a helluva lot of explosive
down there



thirty second to detonation

the shock wave going to crush we
norman

maybe
brace yourself

how be that working out by the way

good
thank you
now that i have it
on
why be you laughing
you do not even
know what that means

no
i do not
but i always said to
myself when i die i want to die
laughing


thank you

you know i think you really need to
see a psychologist

have anyone spoken to they yet

the admiral going over the tape
they bring up now

do he know yet what really
happen down there

they be going to want answer and
they be going to keep asking until
they get they

we can refuse to talk

will not make any difference
the tape
document everything

there be one possibility

we all kill ourselves
bad joke
sorry beth

the power allow we to manifest we
fear right
what if we feared the
power to go away

you mean forget

it would erase all we knowledge of
it
all of we power

would it work

yes
and i think we already know it
will

how be that

down below harry said we would all
have to die
since there be no
evidence on that spacecraft that
anybody know time travel through a
black hole be possible and we
all know then we would all have
to die before we could tell anyone
death be the only logical
explanation
but sitting here we
still know
so how be that possible
unless we make ourselves forget

there be some question that we
need to address here

what about

when you be be transferred to
decompression dr
adams you
mention something about a squid

what

squid
however there do not seem
to be any squid recorded on these
tape

squid
i do not remember anything
about a squid
do you say something about a squid
harry

you all ready to go dr


johnson
the psychologist
the one
that write the report

what report
