scraped off in the transport
under the barnacle the container be revealed to make of
gold
Chernick look startle

look closely at it

be this make of solid gold

do you know the Abkani be the first
civilization to use gold for they
valuables
they believe it held the
power to contain evil spirit
thousands
of year later we do not even remember

cheung
marko
do not let they get away
agent cheung and marko open sending stream of glowing
bullet across the main hall
but they do not hit anything
agent barr scan around with he riflemounted parameter and
lamp
nothing
Carnby and aline stand back not wanting to get in the
agent way not equip to really help
the dim light suddenly flicker and come back on at full
strength bathing the debris of the battle in a warm glow
agent barr turn he rifle to Carnby and aline
they stand
they ground facing he




Krash read the data streaming by on she bank of monitor
she speak into she omnipresent headset

reading go

hold device
photo be snap by another

the lab be full of sleek hightech lab equipment and state
of the art computer
the room be light with a
fluorescent light
surgical equipment and various piece of
hightech machinery by an autopsy slab
surgical tool
be laid out on a table
pinkertons body be laid out on the slab facedown
fischer stand over pinkertons body
he hold a hightech
handheld scanning device
the scanner be connected to a
large monitor on a dolly next to the slab
fischer hold the scanner a few inch above pinkertons
body passing it along the length of he
the image on the monitor match the movement of the
scanner
it show a realtime internal scan of pinkertons
body display the skeleton internal organ and so on
visible on the monitor be a spinal worm curled up tight
around pinkertons spine


fischer do not look up but he tone suddenly change

you should not be here Carnby
Carnby stand in the doorway

when
use tong fischer peel back the skin of pinkertons back
the spinalworm be attached to pinkertons spine

go twenty year ago
presume dead
i be trying to get more intell but he
record be so classified they be
practically invisible

arnby take the tong from fischer holding open the skin
fischer make a series of incision with the scalpel
disconnect the spinalworm from pinkertons spine

it be fuse with he nervous system


i have never see this kind of symbiosis
before
ischer drop the spinalworm in a tub
ischer notice the handheld scanning device be

scanner still reading something





the Abkani never cease to amaze i
line turn startle to see Hudgens standing behind she

such a complex society at a time when
most of humanity be still hunting and
gathering and huddle around fire

dr
Hudgens

i apologize for snap at you early
now what be you still do here after
all you have be through
Hudgens crane he neck to see Alines computer screen
he
eye light up when he see the scan of the lynchpin artifact

where do you get that image
aline hesitate
Hudgens look curious friendly

edward

this be a major find
i will need to
analyze it
confirm it authenticity

i can do that myself

that be not a request
Hudgens stand up to he full height suddenly menace

where be the artifact



everything okay in here
agent cheung stand at the door still wearing she full
combat gear
she visor be up
she casually hold she rifle

and you be

ms
Cedracs security detail

i dear do you have any idea who i




dr
lionel Hudgens
former agent sciand
spy division
currently advisor
status
i know exactly who you be
but
i be not you dear anything
Hudgens look back at aline and smile warmly

i will just have to hold off i curiosity
until morning
aline smile stiffly
Hudgens move to leave

dr
Hudgens
i forget to ask
do you
find the erebus this time
Hudgens turn back and give aline another smile

just an empty shipwreck
you be right
it be another wild goosechase
Hudgens exit quickly
aline and agent cheung watch he go

since when do i have a security detail

since it seem like you needed it



Carnby lie on a bed with he shirt off
fischer run the
handheld scanner over Carnbys torso
he look at the
result of Carnbys scan on a monitor
spinal worm be visible around Carnbys spine
but it look
different than the other
it be small and shriveled and
seem barely attached to the spine

there be one inside you too
but the
symbiosis be incomplete

can you remove it

i could try
but it might paralyze you



aline sit at she computer checking out scan of the
four Abkani artifact
she be running an analysis the symbol
carved into each artifact
stream of calculation run across the screen as the computer
process
the computer as it come to a conclusion
the symbol correlate to constellation in the night sky
aline hit on she computer and it burn a of the
information she have processed
aline search through a roll of map
she pull out a map of
north america and lay it out on a work station
aline draw line across the map trying to pinpoint a
location base on the constellation
she mark the map up
with latitude and longitude calculation
she stop
she look back up at the computer screen
she tap
she pen on the map
she look frustrated

what be miss
the computer again
the copy have be make
aline roll up the map and start to pack up she belongings




fischer and Carnby stand in front of an open armory cabinet
sleek assault rifle be lined up on a rack beside they
they stand on either side of a counter
large monitor be on
the wall behind they

i be not much for coincidence
these
organism must be connected to those
thing from the museum

we call they xenomorphs

catchy
when do they first appear


with a remote control fischer click through image on the
monitor as he talk
he bring up a series of anatomical
schematics of the xenomorph creature

two year ago
they have be s top
priority ever since
but it be be almost
exclusively in rural area
this kind of
urban infiltration be unprecedented

have you isolated any weakness
fischer bring up an image of the periodic table

most metal pass right through they
so
normal bullet and blade be useless
but they be vulnerable to element to

osmium iridium platinum and gold
negate they ability to disrupt
electricity

if they disrupt electricity why do i
flashlight still work

the close the current to it power
source the less disruption
fischer take a handheld parameter scanning device off a
rack
it be a sleek update version of Carnbys parameter
similar to the agent riflemounted scanner

this be calibrate to track they
disruption field
it will not help you see
they but you will know when they be
nearby
fischer bring up a computer simulation of the creature
disruption field display how it work

they live almost exclusively in darkness
Sunlights lethal in large dose
but
only certain light frequency hurt they
fischer take a rifle off the rack and lay it down on the
counter in front of they



off another rack fischer pick up a lamp
he flip it on and
off shining the bright blue beam around
fischer snap the
lamp into place at the top of the rifle

these lamp be set to an effective
frequency
fischer take out several magazine of ammo out of the
cabinet
he discharge a bullet
it glow yellow in he hand

but for maximum damage we use bullet
coated in a photonaccelerated
luminescent resin
cut right through
they
fischer hand the rifle and a magazine to Carnby
Carnby
load the magazine and check the rifle like a pro

i be going to need a lot of those





Carnby unlock the multiple lock on the front door to his
loft and enter
he carry a heavy dufflebag
he look
exhaust
warily Carnby hold out the handheld scanner checking to
see if it register anything
but the loft read clean
Carnby put the scanner down on a counter and allow himself
to relax as he enter the loft
Carnby walk in slowly a man whose adrenaline be wearing off
and be only now feeling the pain
he shrug off he trench
coat and let we it drop on the floor
he drop the dufflebag on the floor
he kick off he boot
he pull off he holster and gun and drop they on a table
Carnby take out the lynchpin artifact
he put it down on a
work station in the lab area
Carnby pull off he shirt
he back be marked with old scar
and fresh bruise
Carnby walk over to he bed
he drop down onto the bed
he
body sink down finally relax

five minute
Carnby fall fast asleep



fischer sit at he computer

flash again



fischer
fischer turn to see agent mile standing at the door

commander burke want to see you


Hudgens walk through a dank cement room
various piece of
scientific equipment sit in a corner
shelf be lined with
ancient artifact small sculpture and mask
Hudgens stop at a work station and pause
look of pain
cross he face
he wince holding it in
he steady
himself
at the other side of the lab be a large recess in the space
the open be covered by thick cage bar covered in gold
the cage appear to be empty
but suddenly an invisible creature into the bar of
the cage trying to lunge at Hudgens
as it hit the bar finger of electricity jolt through it
making it visible for a split second
Hudgens watch calmly
he go to a small dial build into
the wall beside the cage
Hudgens turn up the dial
in the cage jagged bolt of electricity jolt around the
invisible creature
it and from the
electricity


finally the creature collapse and fade visible
the
creature be unconscious but still alive
Hudgens turn the dial back down
Hudgens pick up a hypodermic syringe from a counter next to
the cage

of it scale

foot and razorsharp jaw snap away it segmented scaled
body wrthe in he grip

if you can not beat we fischer join we
Hudgens grab fischer by he hair and pull he head back
forcing he mouth open

we follow the spinalworm as it enter Fischers mouth
slipping down he throat
we continue to follow the spinalworm as it make it way
through Fischers body weave through the twist and turn
of he digestive system and internal organ
the spinalworm tear through layer of Fischers inside
finally making it way to he spine
the spinalworm then
wrap itself around Fischers spine it tiny claw foot
grab hold and attach themselves along it length
we move up Fischers spinal cord to he brain
the spinal
worm seem to be cause synapse to fire in chaotic burst
we travel through Fischers brain and out of he eye

Fischers expression be now calm
Hudgens regards fischer
looking please with himself






something chase young edward as he run for he life through
the misty dark forest
he run towards a light up ahead
i

she would
young edward enter the she would closing the door behind he
the small she would be cluttered with equipment for repair
power line
large transformer module sit at the back of
the she would
it and with electricity
something compel young edward to move closer towards the
transformer and reach out a trembling hand
he place his
hand against the transformer front grill
with a sudden and electricity course through
young edward
jagged finger of blue light jolt around he




it be night
the loft be dark
Carnby and aline be fast
asleep on the bed lying next to one another
Carnby wake up with a start
he try to get he bearing
Carnby look surprise to see aline lying next to he
he quietly get out of bed letting she sleep
he pull on a
fresh shirt
Carnby pad over to the lab area and turn on a desk light
he see the wrap item aline place on he work station
Carnby unwrap the item
they be the three Abkani artifact
from the museum
Carnby pick up the lynchpin artifact turning it around
something catch he eye
Carnby fiddle with the artifact
suddenly the artifact telescope out
instead of one thick
ring it be now three successively small ring one pile
on the other with a common hollow middle


Carnby pick up the large ring artifact
he slot it into
place on the telescoped lynchpin artifact
next Carnby slot
in the medium and small ring into place
the four piece fit together perfectly create a
cylindrical device with a small round opening in the bottom



Carnby cook omelette in the kitchen area of the loft
the
ingredient be spread out on the counter
aline wake up
she sit up in the bed and look around

something smell amazing

omelette
aline give he a look

i love omelette

i know
Carnby sit down across from aline
they eat while they talk

i figure out a connection with the
symbol on those artifact
they
correspond to constellation
but
something miss

maybe this will help
Carnby take out the assemble Abkani device and put it down
on the table between they
aline pick up the device fascinated
she run she finger
over the Abkani symbol carved into the lynchpin artifact
she go to she bag and pull out the map she be working on
and the
she hand Carnby the

can you run the program on this
Carnby go over to he computer and insert the


aline spread out the map
she draw line across it
connecting up constellation with location on the map
she
write out latitude and longitude calculation
aline come up to Carnby at the computer
the program be
waiting for she calculation
she lean past Carnby and enter the latitude and longitude
number into the program
the computer process the
information
hundreds of map image flash across the screen
as the computer search for a match

what be we looking for

the Abkani used constellation to pin
point a geographical location
but i
do not think i can isolate it close than
a hundred mile radius
the computer find a match
specific map appear onscreen
with a mile radius circle marked in the center of it

edward

yeah
that be we right there
Carnby point to a spot on the onscreen map




Carnby put the dish from they meal into the kitchen sink

that look like john

it be
the other two be from the

aline come up to Carnby
he stand over johns corpse

you have no choice

something controlling they

how many be there altogether

twenty
including i
the parameter start again loud and more
frenetic
the light start to flicker fade up and down
Carnby unzip the dufflebag
it be full of equipment
given to he by fischer
Carnby load an assault rifle with
magazine
he load a pistol with the glow bullet
Carnby throw aline the pistol
she catch it in midair
she check it like a pro
aline and Carnby stand together gun draw ready
there be a moment of quiet
they listen
the light in the loft flicker
the scanner
something into the loft front door
Carnby grab the parameter
it more insistently
the front door open knock right off it hinge by
the invisible creature crashing through it




the invisible xenomorph creature skew inhuman


as
it look across the loft searching
it locate Carnby and
aline and head directly for they

ll that be visible of the creature trajectory be furniture
be knock aside as the creature rush towards they
the creature right through a glasstopped work table
it
paper whirl around in it wake


aline and Carnby stand they ground facing the oncoming
creature as it lunge towards they
Carnby and aline leap out of the way at the last moment
rolling away in opposite direction they simultaneously

they glow bullet hit the creature dead on
the creature flashing visible from the multiple
impact

something behind he
he turn to look
something grab the agent he back against the wall

now that the agent have a
handle on this new threat they precision and speed return
soon the battle be over

after he

Krash
what be you reading


rash swivel in she chair processing data making
adjustment to sensor and checking out the information
scrol across the bank of monitor
she wear a headset

we be practically off the scale
commander
this be unprecedented
should
i initiate contingency NineAlpha

the military
we do not have time to wait
for they to mobilize

be that a negative commander


burke lead Carnby aline and miles to the entrance hall

no

but i will not hold i breath
by the time
this clear defense council we will be
dead or drink

but commander

i know miles
but backup will not make it
before sunrise
several raise platform stand in the middle of the hall
on one platform agent turner help two unload a large
goldplated generator from the back of a Humvee

generator will be online shortly sir
burke nod to turner as he and the other walk by
Carnby and
aline get into step with burke and miles

it look like you be going to war

we be
the high xeno concentration on
record be closing in on this location
this could be we chance to wipe they out
once and for all
tunnel carved directly into the rock wall of the mine
lead off into darkness
Carnby stare down at the tunnel

we need to go down there

what


they be coming here for a reason
until
we know what they be after we be never
really going to be able to stop they
agent miles consult he handheld parameter

something definitely down there sir
but there be too much interference to get
a clear read from here
miles look at burke expectantly
Carnby and aline watch he
as well
burke look conflicted

goddamn it
mile you be in charge of
perimeter defense

i have be think about something
the
Abkani prophecy
the shadow that make
ghost of man

every culture have a story about the end
of the world

but not every story start to come true
agent barr carry a handheld parameter
it be picking up
high electromagnetic reading

it be definitely this way sir
they pass by various piece of mining equipment long since
discard
thick dust and cobweb hang off the equipment
they make they way down the tunnel






the tunnel end at a slightly large round chamber with
wall of solid rock
they can not go any far
cobweb and
thick dust hang everywhere
Carnby aline burke barr cheung and marko emerge out of
the tunnel into the chamber

it be a dead end
agent barr check he parameter

reading be get strong
Carnby look around sensing something
he wipe away some
cobweb and dust and run he hand over the chamber wall

we will doubleback
take another tunnel

wait
aline look at this

agent marko fall directly onto the spike
he be impaled on
they




the other rush to the lip of the shaft
they can barely see

jagged bolt of lightning and echo around
they
the sound of come up around they
suddenly one by one creature start fade into visibility
behind they
more and more creature appear fade visible
until there be dozens of xenomorph creature stretching down
the mountainside
Hudgens look back at he creature army
he let we an evil
smile slip across he face
all at once the creature start leap down the
mountainside
as they run they all start fade invisible



dozens of agent in full combat gear be in position
they
be arm tense and ready
suddenly the scanner on agent miles rifle start to
at first the be spread apart
then the sound in
rapid succession fast and fast

incoming



agent miles run up to agent turner
he be still tinkering
with the generator
the spotlight be still off

where the hell be the light

the generator not coming online
they
must be disrupt it



burke and agent barr and cheung lower themselves down the
shaft on ziplines
they descend quickly and smoothly
Carnby and aline have to take the long way down
they
carefully climb down the rung of the ancient wooden ladder
build into the shaft
Carnby step down on a weak rung and it start to give way
when aline step down on it moment later it break
line start to fall but Carnby be there to catch she


as burke descend he speak into he commlink

we have get incoming
what be you order

hold tight mile
once we retrieve marko
we be coming back up
whatever down
here be going to have to wait
there be a sound above they

shaft
there be a sound
the collapse floor have trigger a trap
in the ceiling directly above the shaft a heavy round stone
column suddenly break loose
more rock fragment rain down
into the shaft



everyone press against the shaft wall to avoid the falling
rock
the stone column drop into the shaft with a thunderous

it fit perfectly
the column start sliding down the shaft towards they




in the distance a bright flash go off
then another
and
another
the flash light up the landscape
the inhuman
of the creature can be hear in the distance
the helicopter all take off hovering up into the air above
the mine


agent miles and the agent in position watch the horizon
dozens of flash go off in the distance

they have hit the outer perimeter


mile scanner be reading off the scale
it at a
frenetic pace register dozens of approaching creature

Electromagnetics around the mine be off
the scale
Krashs voice start to with

Krash
report
Krash
but the commlink be now only giving off




the friction from the shaft wall be the only thing slow
the stone column relentless descent down the shaft
the weight of the column crumple the ladder as it fall
as Carnby and aline try to climb down the ladder it be
get more and more rickety and unsteady
burke and barr be almost at the bottom of the shaft
cheung be have problem with she zipline
it keep
jamming slow she descent


the floor be covered in a thick layer of fine sand
burke land safely
barr land next to he
they quickly detach they ziplines and pull Markos body off
the spike


the stone column be almost at aline and Carnby
the ladder be
be ripped apart by the column
they be out of time

hovering on she jammed zipline
but they be going too fast
to stop



burke train he rifle on the spike
he

they crumble no longer dangerous
Carnby and aline drop down out of the shaft
Carnby let we go
of the ziplines and they fall to the sand by the spike
rolling to safety
burke look up the shaft
he see cheung hovering above the
stone column almost at she

cheung
cut the line


the column continue to drop
it be right above cheung
cheung pull out a knife and cut the zipline cord
she
drop down the rest of the way



as agent cheung land she break she ankle from the impact
she in pain
burke haul cheung out of the way at the last second
he column drop to the ground with a totally seal
off the shaft
there be no way back up

he sand chamber be pitch black
the only light come from
they lamp and flashlight
barr wrap up Cheungs break ankle
line inspect the Abkani symbol carved into the wall of
she lay she rifle against the wall as she read they
large rough statue depict the xenomorph creature have
be carved directly into the rock wall of the chamber
one wall be covered floor to ceiling with human skull

it be a warn

subtle

the gist of it be even if you make it
down here alive you be already dead

Krash i need another exit
can you run a
sonar pulse at this depth

Krash
be you reading i
mile

can not get through to Krash either
too
much interference

use the second perimeter as you fire
mark
i will be there as soon as i find a
way out



hold you fire until they be at the
second perimeter

fire

Carnby aline barr and burke take cover behind the stone
column
burke hold a remote detonator
it be active
burke try to get a signal on he commlink
but all he get
be
look grim burke prepare to press the button
on the detonator

you sure this be going to work
burke shrug and press the button
the detonator count
down



tremendous rock the sand chamber
sand whirl
through the air
concrete fragment blow out from the recess
as the smoke clear Carnby aline burke and barr approach
the recess
the concrete wall have be blown open
smoke
rise up off the ruine wall
the sand chamber now open up into another dark room




Carnby aline barr and burke step over the rubble of the
concrete wall
they shine they light around the dark room
they be in a large abandoned bureau lab
thick dust
cover all surface
but it be once a hightech facility
on one side of the lab be a slide metal door

what be this place
medical equipment scientific instrument and computer have
be left as they be untouched for two decade
series of glass tube be lined up along one wall
in each
tube a spinalworm lie dead float in gelatinous liquid
aline check out a series of diagram affix to another
wall
they be anatomical schematic for the spinalworms
there be also diagram of the human body with marking
isolating key area of the spinal cord
Carnby stand in front of a row of twenty clear glass basin
each about the size of a child


each basin have a small metal tag on it
Carnby wipe the
layer of dust off one of the metal tag
the tag read



this be where it happen
aline step up next to Carnby

who do this to you
burke and barr continue to explore the room with they rifle
mount lamp
barr find a pair of huge metal hangar door

commander
Carnby burke and aline approach barr at the hangar door
next to the hangar door be a control panel
barr pull the
front off the control panel revealing a rust handcrank
barr pull on the handcrank
it will not give
Carnby join he
and together they strain to move the handcrank
the hand
crank into the open position
an old mechanism be engaged
the hangar door slide open
revealing another doorway behind they
but this one be
clearly not part of the lab
it be an ancient solid gold door carved with Abkani
symbol
the gold door be build into a wall of rough rock
it
look like the lab be build right around the gold door
in the center of the door be a small cylindrical open

line use she flashlight to read the symbol on the door
one symbol be prominent among the other
the

edward look


aline reach into she pack and take out the Abkani device
it be the exact size of the cylindrical open in the door
the same pictogram be engraved on the lynchpin

so it be a key
burke survey the room with a grim expression

i say we get two option
one we open
this door deal with whatever on the
other side

the pictogram carved here make it pretty
clear that be a bad idea

two we set enough to bury this
place
keep whatever in there down
here for good
Carnby stare at the gold door

the answer i have be looking for i
whole life could be in there

some door be locked for a reason
Carnby look away from the gold door

barr
how much you get leave
barr pull open he pack revealing several package of

enough to blow this place to
barr be cut off by a bullet hitting he in the head
blood spurt out as barr collapse to the ground dead
Hudgens stand behind they carrying two pistol




i be afraid i can not allow that
before they can react Hudgens press a pistol to Alines
throat
he point the other pistol at burke and Carnby

now drop you weapon and back away
Carnby and burke drop they gun and step back
Carnby glare
at Hudgens

it be

we early work be crude i admit
but
eventually we perfect the implant
process
you be we last failure
Carnby
if you have not escaped never
would have shut down the experiment
burkes eye flash with anger

there be no way this be sanction

before you kind take over have very
different
priority
now you just
blaze in and destroy everything before we
can learn to control it
i have wasted
twenty year working in secret because of
shortsighted man like you
Hudgens see the Abkani device aline be holding

there it be
Alines expression be firm unafraid
she grip the device
tightly
Hudgens be about to pull the trigger

you be a fine archeologist

aline
Hudgens turn to Carnby curious




give he the key
enough people have die
today
aline see Carnby be serious
she hold out the device to
Hudgens

you could not have open it anyway
not
without this
Hudgens take out the hollow cylinder artifact he find on
the erebus
he hand it to aline
aline insert the artifact into the hollow circular space at
the bottom of the device turning it into place
the device
be now a full cylinder with a flat protrusion on the bottom
with one pistol pointed at burke and Carnby and the other at
aline Hudgens direct she to the gold door

insert the key

line insert the device into the open in the door

now turn it
aline rotate the device use the flat protrusion on the
bottom
it into place
small crack splinter away from the open where the
device sit
the crack split off into several other crack
Hudgens point he pistol at the other but he attention
be clearly directed at the gold door

when we find the first of they see
just another threat to be eliminate
but
i know it be something more
it be the
first
the first to wake
i have wake
other since then

pack
burke and aline understand

he empty doorway now lead into darkness on the other side





he creature move up to Hudgens hand smelling it



Carnby shove the handcrank into the close position
the hangar door in front of the Abkani doorway start to
close
aline back away from the doorway
aline with an assault rifle
the glow bullet
streak into the dark cave hitting several of the approaching
creature
but there be too many of they
they keep coming
the hangar door be almost closed
the xenomorphs be only a
few foot from the doorway
the hangar door closed just in time
heavy impact against the other side of the hangar
door
then another
the xenomorphs be trying to get though
burke be positioning charge around the lab
he wire
they all through a remote detonator

these door will not hold they for long

once we get out we can remote detonate
Carnby approach the slide metal door at the side of the
lab
the dust around the door have be sweep back

look at the dust on the floor
this be
where Hudgens get in
Carnby engage the open mechanism and the door slide
open revealing a dark tunnel leading away from it
burke make sure the remote detonator signal be active
all
he have to do be press the button on the detonator
the hangar door from the impact of creature slamming
into they


Carnby aline and burke run down the long dark tunnel
light they way with flashlight
few door line the tunnel but they be all welded shut
Carnby spot a dim light up ahead



over there

strip of
light be visible way up high at the top of a long shaft
aline climb up the ladder
Carnby climb up behind she
burke shine he lamp down the dark tunnel
the
sound of impact against the door echo down the tunnel
burke look at the remote detonator in he hand

aline climb up the rung of the ladder build into the shaft
wall
Carnby climb up after she

urke stand at the bottom of the shaft looking up at they
Carnby stop climb and look down at burke

burkes rifle be jammed into the open mechanism of the
slide door block it from engaging
the hangar door be warped from the impact
the gap between
the door be be pull open by dozens of creature
the
hangar door start to buckle under the pressure
he remote detonator in burkes hand be now active


Carnby and aline quickly climb up the ladder
they be almost
at the top of the shaft
the shaft be sealed with a pair of corrugated metal door
sunlight shine through the thin crack between the door
Carnby point he gun at the metal door above they

shop look ready to open
car be park along the street
but no one be driving
the neighborhood be empty



Carnby and aline walk down a wide street in the middle of the
city downtown core
no one be visible anywhere

edward
what be going on
Carnby look ashen
they stand in the middle of a downtown
intersection empty street stretching out in all direction

remember what Hudgens said
i be his
last failure
he said he perfect the
implant process

it can not be

then where the hell be everybody
where be
everybody go
we look down at Carnby and aline alone in the intersection
empty street all around they
we start to float up above
they get a wide and wide bird eye view of the city
we swoop up high above they but still no one be visible
anywhere in the city
we float up until the entire city
stretch out below we
nothing move
no one can be see
