lisa fremont

you must be kidding
beautiful
young woman and you a reasonably
healthy specimen of manhood

she expect i to marry she

that be normal

i do not want to

slap cold oil on
he
that be abnormal

i be not ready for marriage

nonsense
man be always ready for
marriage with the right girl
and
lisa fremont be the right girl for
any man with half a brain who can
get one eye open

she be all right

behind every ridiculous statement be
always hidden the true because
what be it
you have a fight

no

she father loading up the shotgun

stella

it be happen before you know
some
of the world happy marriage
have start under the guna you
might say

she be just not the girl for i

she be only perfect

too perfect
too beautiful too
talented too sophisticated too
everything but what i want

be what you want something you can
discuss

it be very simple
she belong in
that rarefy atmosphere of park
avenue expensive restaurant and
literary cocktail party

people with sense can belong wherever
they be put

can you see she tramp around the
world with a camera bum who never
have more than a week salary in the
bank
if only she be ordinary

you be never going to marry

probably
but when i do it will be to
someone who think of life as more
than a new dress a lobster dinner
and the late scandal
i need a
woman who will go anywhere do anything
and love it

the only honest thing to do be call
it off
let she look for somebody
else

i can just hear you now
get out of
here you perfect wonderful woman
you be too good for i


that be the hard part

look mr
jefferies
i be not educated
i be not even sophisticated
but i
can tell you this when a man and
a woman see each other and like
each other they should come
together wham like two taxy on
broadway
not sit around study
each other like specimen in at
bottle

there be an intelligent way to approach
marriage

intelligence
nothing have cause the
human race more trouble
modern
marriage

we have progress emotionally in

baloney
once it be see somebody
get excite get marry now
it be read book fence with four
syllable word psychoanalyze each
other until you can not tell a petting
party from a civil service exam

people have different emotional level
that

ask for trouble and you get it
why
there be a good boy in i neighborhood
who go with a nice girl across the
street for three year
then he
refuse to marry she
why
because
she only score sixtyone on a look
magazine marriage quiz

when i married myles we be both
maladjusted misfit
we still be
and we have loved every minute of it

that be fine stella

okay but i be going to spread some
common sense on the bread

Dufresne just over from paris

then two fall showing
twenty block apart
then i have to
have a cocktail with leland and slim

then i have to dash back and change

mock seriousness

mint green

and to think i planted three nice
item about you in the column today

that be good news

someday you might want to open up
you own studio here

how could i run it from say
pakistan

jeff be not it time you come home
you could pick you assignment

i wish there be one i wanted

as if he can not believe
she

for what

for yourself and i
i could get you a dozen assignment
tomorrow
fashion portrait

do not laugh
i could do it

that be what i be afraid of
could you see i driving down to
the fashion salon in a jeep wearing
combat boot and a three day beard
he chuckle at the
thought

i could see you looking handsome and
successful in a dark blue flannel
suit

look directly at
she
let we not talk any more nonsense
huh

i would well start setting up for
dinner

that be what be know as manless
melancholia


miss lonely heart
at least that be
something you will never have to worry
about

oh
you can see i apartment all the
way up on rd street

not exactly but we have a little
apartment here that be probably about
as popular as yours
you of course remember miss torso

well she picked the most prosperous
looking one

she be not in love with he or any
of they

how can you tell that from here

you said it resemble i apartment
do not you

where be that music coming from

oh
some songwriter
in the studio
apartment
live alone
probably have
an unhappy marriage

put down the
food
i think it be enchanting

almost as if it be be written
especially for we

no wonder he be have so much trouble
with it

well at least you can not say the
dinner be not right

lisa it be perfect
look down at the
food without
enthusiasm
as always


there can not be that much difference
between people and the way they live
we all eat talk drink laugh sleep
wear clothes

well now look

if you be saying all this just because
you do not want to tell i the truth
because you be hide something from
i then maybe i can understand

there be nothing i be hide
it be
just that

will not let he break
in
it do not make sense to i
what be
so different about it here from over
there or any place you go that one
person could not live in both place
just as easily

some people can
now if you will let
i explain

what be it but travel from one
place to another taking picture
it be just like be a tourist on an
endless vacation

all right
that be you opinion
you be
entitle to it but

it be ridiculous for you to say that
it can only be do by a special
private little group of anoint
people

i make a simple but true statement
and i will back it up if you will just
shut up for a minute

if you opinion be as rude as you
manner i be not sure i want to hear
it

lisa simmer down will you

something start she
up again
you can not fit in here i can not fit
in there
accord to you people
should be born live an die on the
same

lisa
shut up

do you ever eat fish head and rice

of course not

you might have to if you go with
i
ever try to keep warm in a
at fifteen thousand foot at twenty
below zero

oh i do that all the time
whenever
i have a few minute after lunch

ever get shot at run over sandbag
at night because people get
unfavorable publicity from you
camera

those high heel would be a lot of
use in the jungle and those nylon
and sixounce lingerie

three

well they would be very stylish in
finland just before you freeze to
death
begin to get the idea

if there be one thing i know it be
how to wear the proper clothes

huh
try and find a raincoat in
brazil
even when it be not rain
lisa on this job you carry one
suitcase
you home be the available
transportation
you sleep rarely
bathe even less and sometime the
food you even look at when they be
alive

jeff you do not have to be
deliberately repulsive just to impress
i i be wrong

if anything i be making it sound
good
let we face it lisa
you be not
make for that kind of a life
few
people be

you be too stubborn to argue with

i be not stubborn
i be truthful
lisa with sarcasm

i know
lesser man would have tell
i it be one long holiday and i
would have awaken to a rude
disillusionment

now if you want to get vicious i would
be very happy to accommodate you

no
i do not particularly want that
so that be it
you will not stay here
i can not go with you

it would be the wrong thing

you do not think either one of we
could ever change

right now it do not seem so

i be in love with you
i do not care
what you do for a live
somehow i
would just like to be part of it

and it be deflate to find out that
the only way i can be part of it
be to take out a subscription to
you magazine
i guess i be not the
girl i think i be

there be nothing wrong with you lisa
you have the town in the palm of
you hand

not quite it seem
toss a stole over
she shoulder
goodbye jeff

the insurance company would be a lot
happy if you sleep in you bed

someday she will find she
happiness

and some man will lose his

he be taking something out of the
apartment
i be certain

he personal effect
he be probably
running away the coward

sometimes it be bad to stay than it
be to run

of man to do it

put oil and power
away
what about this morning

that he
should not keep he shade down and
hide behind they

that be where he be be clever
act
nonchalant

and that be where you be not be
clever

in front of the open shade

for all you know there be something
a lot more sinister going on behind
those shade

goodnight


look doyle it be just one of those
thing i can not tell you on the phone
you have to be here and see the
whole setup

it be probably nothing important
just a little neighborhood murder
that be all
as a matter of fact i
do say murder

i only thought be to throw a little
business you way
good detective
i reasoned would jump at the chance
to detect

well i usually take i good picture
on i day off
okay doyle soon as you can

stella i i can not tell you what a
welcome sight this be
no wonder
you husband still in love with
you

police

pause in cut
food
huh

you called the police

oh
well yes and no
it be not an
official call
he be just a friend
an old ornery friend

now just where do you suppose he cut
she up

oh of course
in the bathtub
that be the only place he could wash
away the blood

he would well get that trunk out of
there before be start to leak

Haarree

look
look mr
jefferies

i think doyle would get here before
the trunk go or i would have called
the police
now we be going to lose it

stella do not do anything reckless

i be just going to get the name of
they truck

i will watch the alleyway in case
it go that way

long distance


you do not see the kill or the
body
how do you know there be a
murder

because everything that mane do
have be suspicious
trip at night
in the rain saw knife trunk
with rope and a wife that be not
there any more

i will admit it all have a mysterious
sound but be could mean a number
of different thing
murder be the
least likely

go ahead doyle tell i he be an
unemployed magician amusing the
neighborhood with sleightofhand

it be too stupid and obvious a way to
murder in full view of fifty
window and then sit over there
smoking a cigar waiting for
the police to pick he up

well officer do you duty

you have get a lot to lean about
homicide jeff
moron have committed
murder so shrewdly that it take a
hundred train police mind to catch
they
that salesman would not just
knock off he wife after dinner
toss she in a trunk and put she in
storage

i will bet it be be do

almost everything be do
under panic
but this be a thousand
to one shot
that mane still sitting
around he apartment
he be not
panick

you think i make all this up

i think you see something that
probably have a very simple
explanation

for instance

he wife take a trip

she be an invalid

you told i
i have get to run jeff

all right you do not believe i

i uh will not report it to the
department
let i poke into a little
on i own
no point in you get
any ridiculous publicity

thanks

we know the wife be go
i will see
if i can find out where

do that

you have any headach lately

not til you show up

Uhhuh
well it will wear off in time
along with the hallucination
see
you around

by the way what happen to you
leg

i be jaywalking



where

the indianapolis speedway

during the race

yup

he have a six month lease and have
used up a little over five and a
half month of it
quiet
drink but not to drunkenness
pay he bill promptly with money
earned as a consume jewelry salesman
wholesale
keep to himself and
none of the neighbor get close to
he or he wife

i think they missed they chance
with she

she never left the apartment

then where be she in the ice box

until yesterday morning

what time

six ayem

i think that be about the time i fell
asleep

too bad
the Thorwalds be just
leaving the apartment house at that
time

feel a little foolish

not yet

how be you wife

oh oh she be fine
just fine

who said they left then

who left where

the Thorwalds at six in the
morning

the build superintendent and two
tenant
flat statement no
hesitation
and they all jibe to
the letter
the Thorwalds be leaving
for the railroad station

now how could anybody guess that
they have perhaps sign on they
luggage grand central or bust


the superintendent meet Thorwald coming
back
he said Thorwald told he he
have just put he wife on the train
for the country

very convenient guy this
superintendent
have you check his
bank deposit lately

jeff huh

well what good be his
information
it be a secondhand
version of an unsupported statement
by the murderer himself Thorwald
anybody actually see the wife get on
the train

i hate to remind you but this all
start because you said she be
murdered
now do anyone including
you actually see she murder

doyle be you interest in solving
a case or making i look foolish

if possible both

well then do a good job of it
get
over there and search Thorwalds
apartment
it must be kneedeep in
evidence

i can not do that

i mean when he go out for a paper
or a drink or something
what he
do not know will not hurt he

i can not do it even if he be go

what be the matter
do he have a
courtesy card from the police
department

now do not get i mad
even a detective
can not walk in anybodies apartment
and search it
if i be ever catch
in there i would lose i badge inside
of ten minute

just make sure you be not catch
if
you find something you have get a
murderer and nobody will care about
a couple of house rule
if you find
nothing he be clear

at the risk of sound stuffy jeff
i will remind you of the constitution
and the phrase search warrant issued
by a judge who know the bill of
right verbatim
he must ask for
evidence

give he evidence

i can hear myself starting out
you
honor i have a friend who be an
amateur sleuth an one night after
a heavy supper
he shake he head
no
he would throw the new york state penal
code right in i face
and it be
six volume

by morning there might not be anything
left to find in he apartment

detective nightmare

what do you need before you can search
bloody footstep leading up to the
door

one thing i do not need be heckle
you called and ask i for help
and now you be acting like a taxpayer

turn and look at
jeff
how do we ever stand each other in
that same plane for three year

you know every day for three year
i ask myself that same question

from he

tell he not to waste time calling
to get over here soon as he can
i
think Thorwalds pulling out tonight

he know
do not worry tess
it be a man

long distance again

quick
take a look
Thorwalds get
ready to pull out for good

it do not seem to be in any hurry

stare out the window
exasperate
he be just laying all he thing
out on one of the bed
coats suit
shirt sox even he wife

that alligator bag he wife have on
the bedpost

what about it

he have it hidden in the dresser
well at least it be in there
he
take it out go to the phone and
called somebody long distance

he wife jewelry be in the handbag
and something about it worried he
he be asking somebody advice over
the phone

someone not he wife

i never see he ask she for advise
before
but she volunteer plenty

i wonder where he be going now

i do not know

suppose he do not come back again

all he thing be still
pile on the bed

well i guess it be safe to put on
some light now

not yet

he must have go somewhere to the
right

all day long i have tried to keep i
mind on work

thinking about Thorwald

and you and you friend doyle

he left

not a word
he be going to check on
the railroad station and the trunk
he must be still on it

something on you mind lisa

it do not make sense to i

what do not

woman be not that unpredictable

losing a little
patience
lisa i can not guess what you be
think

woman have a favorite handbag it
always hang on she bedpost where
she can get at it
then she take a
trip and leaf it behind
why

because she do not know she be going
on a trip and where she be going
she would not need a handbag

but only she husband would know that
and the jewelry
woman do not keep
all they jewelry in a purse all
tangled get scratched and twist
up

do they hide it in they husband
clothes

they do not
and they do not leave it
behind they
woman going anywhere
but the hospital would always take
makeup perfume and jewelry

inside stuff

basic equipment
you do not leave it
behind in you husband drawer in
you favorite handbag

i be with you sweetie but detective
thomas
doyle have a pat answer for
that

that mrs
Thorwald left at six ayem
yesterday with she husband

that be what the witness told he

well i have a pat rebuttal for mr
doyle that could not be mrs
Thorwald or i do not know woman

still those witness

we will agree they see a woman but
she be not mrs
Thorwald
that
be yet

come here

i would like to see you friend face
when we tell he
he do not sound
like much of a detective

do not be too hard on he
he be a
steady worker
i wish he would get there
though

do not rush i
we have all night

we have all what

night
i be going to stay with you

you will have to clear that through i
landlord

i have the whole weekend off

one bed and

say anything else and i will stay
tomorrow night too

lisa i will not be able to give you
any

pajamas

you said i would have to live out of one
suitcase
i will bet yours be not this small

that be a suitcase

mark cross overnight case anyway
compact but ample enough

i will trade you i feminine
intuition for a bed for the night

i would be no good than Thorwald to
refuse

there be that song again

where do a man get the inspiration
for a song like that

from he landlord once a month

it be utterly beautiful
i wish i could be creative

you be
you have a talent for
create difficult situation

i do

staying the night here uninvited

surprise be the most important
element of attack
and beside you be not up on you
private eye literature
when they be
in trouble it be always they girl
friday who get they out of it

the same girl who keep he out of
the clutch of seductive show girl
and overpassionate daughter of the
rich

the same

but he never end up marry she
strange

stand up
deadpan
weird
she do a complete
spin then
ingenuously
why do not i slip into something
comfortable

you mean like the kitchen
and
make we some coffee

exactly what i have in mind along
with some brandy

Haarree

what else do you have on this man
Thorwald

enough to scare i that you would not
get here in time and we would lose he

you think he be get out of here

everything he own be laid out on
the bedroom ready for pack

i be just warming some brandy

mr
doyle
i presume

tom this be miss lisa fremont

how do you do

we think Thorwalds guilty

careful tom

hallo

just a minute please

doyle speak
Uhhuh
yeah
Mummmm mmm
hmm
okay
thank you and goodbye

the coffee will be ready soon
jeff be not you going to tell he
about the jewelry

jewelry

he have he wife jewelry hidden in
among he clothes over there

you sure it belong to he wife

it be in she favorite handbag
and mr
doyle that can lead to
only one conclusion

namely

that be not mrs
Thorwald who left
with he yesterday morning

you figure that out huh

it be just that woman do not leave
jewelry behind when they go on a
trip

come on tom you do not really
need any of this information do
you

as a matter of fact i do not

lars Thorwald be no more a murderer
than i be

you mean you can explain everything
that go on over there and be
still going on

no

and neither can you
that be a secret and private world
you be looking into out there
people
do a lot at thing in private that
they could not explain in public

like dispose of they wife

get that idea out of you mind
it
will only lead you in the wrong
direction

but tom the saw the knife

do you ever own a saw

well in the garage back home we

and how many people do you cut up
with the couple of with it
or hundred
knife you have probably owned in you
lifetime

but i be not a killer

you logic be backward

you can not ignore the wife
disappearing
and the trunk and
the jewelry

i checked the railroad station
he
buy a ticket
he put she on the
train ten minute later
destination
Merritsville
witness
this deep
he hold he hand a
few foot off the
floor

it might have be a woman but it
could not have be mrs
Thorwald
that jewelry

look miss fremont
that feminine
intuition sell magazine but in
real life it be still a fairy tale
i do not know how many waste year
i have spent running down lead base
on woman intuition

i take it you do not find the trunk
and this be just an old speech you
once give at the Policemans ball

i find the trunk a half hour
after i left here

of course it be normal for a man to
tie he trunk up with a heavy rope

when the lock be break yes

what be in the trunk
surly note
to i

mrs
Thorwalds clothes

clean carefully packed not too
stylish but presentable

do not you take it to the crime lab

i send it on it merry and legal
way

why when a woman only go on a
simple trip do she take everything
she own

let the female psychology department
handle that one

i would say that be look as if she
be not coming back

that be what they call a family
problem

if he wife be not coming back
why do not he tell he landlord

i will answer it for you because he
have something to hide

do uh you tell you landlord
everything

i told you to be careful

if i would be careful pilote that
reconnaissance plane you would not
have taken the kind of picture that
get you a medal a big job fame
money

all the thing i hate

now what do you say we sit down
to a quiet friendly drink or two
forget all about this and tell lie
about the old day in the war
hmmm
he look from one to the other

you be through with the case

there be not any case to be through
with miss fremont
now let we get
down to that friendly drink

maybe you be right
i guess i would well
get home and get some sleep

i be not much of a snifter

if you need any more help jeff
consult the yellow page of you
telephone directory

i hate funny exit line

who be the trunk addressed to

mrs
anna Thorwald

let we wait and see who pick it up

oh that phone call
i give they you number hope you
do not mind

that depend on who they be

the police department at Merritsville
they called to report
the trunk be
just picked up by mrs
anna
Thorwald

do not stay up too late

look

as much as i hate to give thomas
doyle too much credit he might have
get a hold of something when he
said this be pretty private stuff
going on out there

do you suppose it be ethical to watch
a man with binoculars and a long
focus lens until you can see the
freckle on the back of he neck
and almost read he mail do you
suppose it be ethical even if you
prove he do not commit a crime

i be not much on rear window ethics

of course they have the same chance
they can look at i like a bug under
glass if they want to

jeff if anybody walk in here i
do not think they would believe what they
see

huh

you and i with long face plunge
into despair because we find out
that a man do not kill he wife
we be two of the most frighten
ghoul i have ever known

you would think we could be a little bit
happy that the poor woman be alive
and well

whatever happen to that old say
love thou neighbor


i think i will start revive it
tomorrow with say miss torso for
a start

not if i have to move into an
apartment across the courtyard and
do the dance of the seven veil once
an hour
as she lower the
blind
show over for tonight

preview of the come attraction

do mr
doyle think i steal this
case

no lisa i do not think he do


what do you think

i will rephrase the question

thank you

do you like it

well if there be one less thread
this way
and two less that way
i might give up bachelorhood

i will be right back

it be dead
it be be strangled and
the neck be broken

which one of you do it
which one of you killed i dog
no one answer
she
voice be acid
you do not know the meaning of the
word neighbor
neighbor like each
other speak to each other care
if anybody life or die
but none
of you do
you do not talk you do not
help you you do not
even see
but i could not imagine any
even of you be so low that you would
kill a little helpless friendly
dog
the only thing in this whole
neighborhood who liked anybody

do you kill he because he liked
you
just because he liked you

for a minute doyle almost have i
convinced i be wrong

but you be not

in the whole courtyard only one
person do not come to the window

why would Thorwald want to kill a
dog
because it know too much

do you think this be worth waiting
all day to see

be he cleaning house

he be washing down the bathroom wall

must have splattered a lot

well why not
that be what we be all
think
he killed she in there
and he have to wipe up the stain
before he leaf

stella you choice of word

Nobodys invent polite word yet
for kill

lisa lisa on the shelf over
there get i the small yellow box

and that little viewer

half to himself as
he search slide
these be not more than two week old
i hope i do not take all leg art
discover the right
slide
i think this be the one

jeff what be you looking for

something that if i be right
might solve a murder

mrs
Thorwald

uhuh
the dog
i think i know now
why Thorwald killed it

you take a look and tell i what you
see

now take it away

well

it be just a picture of the backyard
that be all

i know
but there be one important
change
the flower in Thorwalds
pet flower bed

you mean the one the dog be sniff
around

and digging in
look at that flower bed

there be a dip at this end
and since
when do flower grow short in two
week

there be something buried there

mrs
Thorwald

you have not spent much time in
cemetery have you
mr
Thorwald could hardly put his
wife into a plot of ground scarcely
one foot square

unless he put in standing on end
which would be very original and not
require the use of either a knife or
a saw
i guess be she be scattered
all over town
leg in the east
river an arm

stella please

something in there
those flower
have be taken up and put back
again

have a hard time saying
it
it could be the knife and the
see

call lieutenant doyle

no let we wait
let we wait until
it get dark
i will go over and dig
it up

i be not going to call doyle until i
show he the body of mrs
Thorwald
and you be not going to dig up
anything an get you neck broken
too

what we have get to do be find some
way to get in there and

he be starting to pack


what be you going back for

you do it Thorwald
you do it

lisa
look out
he be coming

you should not have let she do that
if he ever

look

thank heaven that be over

i have a feel we have just begin

no doubt of it
he be leaving
the
question be when

mind if i use the portable keyhole

not as long as you tell i what you be
looking at

i wonder

what

miss lonely heart just laid out
something that look like sodium
trieckonal capsule

you can tell that from here

i handle enough of those red pill
to put everybody in new jersey asleep
for the winter

would four of they

no but it make the rest easy to
take
and she be reading the bible

then i would not worry too much
but
let we keep an eye on she

you know
you might not be too bad a
bargain for lisa after all

you do not say
i might just take
that compliment as an insult

be not that close

too close

what be he reaction
i mean when
he look at the note

well it be not the kind of expression
that would get he a quick loan at
the bank

jeff how do i do

real professional
would have make a
great layout for the bazaar
the
model press back against a brick
wall eye wild tense
low cut
bodice in new suspicious black
with a

you would make a good door prize at a
wake

jeff the handbag

suppose mrs
Thorwalds wedding ring
be among the jewelry he have in the
handbag
supporting he
proposition
during that phone conversation he
held up three ring one with a
diamond one with a big stone of
some kind and one plain gold band

and the last thing she would leave behind
would be she wedding ring
do you ever leave yours at home

the only way anybody could get that
off would be to chop i finger
let we go down and find out what be
buried in the garden

why not
i always wanted to meet
mrs
Thorwald

what be you two talking about

get a shovel

no

there be probably one in the basement

now wait a minute

jeff if you be squeamish just do not
look

now hold on
i be not a bit squeamish
about what might be under those
flower but i do not care to watch
two woman end up like that dog

you know miss fremont he might
just have something there

there be no point in taking unnecessary
chance
give i the phone book lisa

what for

maybe i can get Thorwald out of the
apartment

we only need a few minute

i will try to give you at least fifteen
minute

how

chelsea
he look up reach
for the phone
we scare he once
maybe we can
scare he again
pick up receiver
pause
i be use that word we a little
too freely i guess
i do not take
any of the chance

shall we vote he in stella
