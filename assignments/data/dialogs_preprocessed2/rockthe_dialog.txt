i
director womack chief of staff sinclair security advisor Lindstrom
and
i

director amway
you have get a lot of people worried frank
can you help we out

i will come straight to the point general kramer
Eightythree
force reconnaissance marine have die under i various command
Fortyseven in northern laos and southern china

southern china
we never admit we send troop into
china

who be that
identify yourself

how old be you white house chief of staff sinclair

i be thirtythree

well white house chief of staff sinclair by you ninth birthday
i have lead over two hundred incursion into china and personally killed
that many of the enemy
general put some duct tape over mr
sinclairs fat
ignorant mouth
he have shit for brain and he be wasting i time

the president calling from moscow

continue frank

eighteen other die in covert illegal operation in chile and
el salvador
remember the gulf war
those pretty smart bomb picture
on


i man lased those target
ten be left to rot outside
baghdad when the conflict end and let we not even mention mogadishu
gentleman
no benefit be paid to they family
no medal
confer
these man die for they country and they be not even given
a coddamn military burial
this situation will not stand
you
will transfer million dollar from a grand cayman red sea trading
company account to an account i designate
from these fund
reparation of one million dollar will be paid to each of the
marine family
the rest of the money will pay for i outfit
expense
be i clear


i

except for the red sea trading company
what be
that

identify yourself


i



i
director womack general

you will be particularly interest
it be a slush fund where the
pentagon keep proceed from illegal arm sales

frank jesus this be classify information

be this true

if you want the money back you will have to tell the attorney
general and the boy down at justice where it come from
good luck

general i have just spoken to the president and he be
clear as hell on this
we will not negotiate with you and we do not care
if

someone please gag that man
alert the media i launch the gas
refuse payment i launch the gas
it be just after midnight
you have hour all of today and half

do not even consider
the standard counter measure general

what be the potential casualty rate of a single rocket
armed with

general peterson

in a dense urban area sixty seventy

well that be not so bad
i
thousand
seventy thousand
dead
one teaspoon will
kill all live organism in a three story office build
get the
point


i

what do hummel mean by standard countermeasure general

napalm
standard pgison gas can be neutralize by napalm
it burn it up consume it upon detonation
the problem be
that

gas be ten time more toxic and design to withstand napalm
hummel must know about willy peter general

course he do
willy peter short for white phosphorous incendiary device still
in it test phase
it detonate at degree enough to burn up

that explain Hummells time frame
he know we be not
operational
what would it take general

to equip a flight of s with willy peter in
hour
an act of god
all right we can try
but
view the use of willy peter as a secondary initiative

then on to we primary initiative

send in



team leader anderson
to

i
womack who be you
good chemical biological man
