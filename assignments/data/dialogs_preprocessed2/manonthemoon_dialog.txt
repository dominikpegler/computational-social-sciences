i be actually british
i be raised
in london and educated at oxford

a read of the great novel ever
written
he hold up the
book
the great gatsby by
scott
fitzgerald

he crack open the
book
chapter one
in i young and more vulnerable
year i father give i some advice
that i have be turning over in i
mind ever since
whenever you feel
like criticize anyone he told
i just remember that all the
people in this world have not have the
advantage you have have


he do not say any more but we have
always be unusually communicative
in a reserve way and i understood
that he mean a great deal more than
that




tank you veddy much

when i come back from the east last
autumn i feel that i wanted the
world to be in uniform and at a sort
of moral attention forever
i wanted
no more riotous excursion with
privilege glimpse into the human
heart


please let we keep it down
we have
a long way to go
only gatsby the man who give he
name to this book be exempt from
i reaction gatsby who
represent everything for which i
have an unaffected scorn


chapter two

be he ever going to stop

sure
when he reach the end


tom be evidently perturbed at
Daisys running around alone for on
the follow saturday night he come
with she to Gatsbys party
perhaps
he presence give the evening it
peculiar quality of
oppressiveness


do Latka

look
i do not have to tolerate this
impoliteness
forget it i be
going to stop the show


no no i be only fooling

i will tell you what
would you
rather have i continue reading or
would you like to hear the
phonograph record

he presence give the evening it
peculiar quality of oppressiveness
it stand out in i memory from
Gatsbys other party that
summer



tomorrow we will run fast
stretch out we arm farther
and
one fine morning so we beat on
boat against the current borne back
ceaselessly into the past


the end

Uhhuh
see with all these
article people think they be
insider
they see tony clifton
and they say ah that be really
andy kaufman

so tony deny being i be the
truth
Tonys not i
but maybe he
be
the audience will never know
they will think they be laughin at i
but actually i will be laughin at
they because they be wrong and i be
right

so you have get this big elaborate
joke which be really only funny to
two people in the universe
you
and you

sure
but think it be kickass
now i get to be tony
i get to dump
the glass of water on someone else
head

but what be the
how will any
of this make you the big star in
the world

george
i be at a stage where the
audience expect i to constantly
shock they
but short of fake i
death or setting the theater on
fire i do not know what else to do
because i have always get to be one
step ahead of they

but i feel you be extend this
philosophy to real life
it be
obsessive
nothing ever on the
level anymore

george it never be
do not you know that


look at this
an evil russian
ooo here an evil nazi he like
to fight dirty
hey here an evil
japanese guy

what be this world war two

you know i always wanted to be a
badguy wrestler

no offense pal but i just do not
think you be build for it
these he
man kick you ass
they be
huge

maybe i will pick on someone small
than i

and i vow to continue wrestle
until i be in a three
minute match with i shoulder
pinned to the mat

by a woman

yes

i be do this because i feel that a
woman cannot beat a man in
wrestle
even if they train with
weight
it require a certain
mental ability
and uh i just do not feel they
have that

no no
woman be superior in many
way
when it come to cook and
clean washing the potato
scrubbing the carrot raising the
baby mopping the floor they
have it all over man
i believe
that

but when it come to wrestle
forget it
if there be a woman that
can prove i wrong come up here
i will shut i mouth and pay she
dollar

any
volunteer

i want to kill that jerk


will you please shake hand go to
you corner and come out
wrestle

i be the winner
i have get the

he point at his
head

and
here you dinnerfortwo voucher
at red lobster

gosh you score
look at all those
goody

buzz off
go patronize somebody
else

hey i hope you do not take that
stuff i said seriously
it be just
part of the show
it be like the old day when a
carnival barker would try to rile up
the crowd

oh
so you be just pretend to
be an asshole

it be what i be good at


merv griffin have received
piece of hate mail

up the audience like punk rock

take it i will break i back

Buddyboy they detest you
next
time you make an appearance woman

hi
um we be suppose to have
andy kaufman on we show this week
but now we producer be not sure
if it be such a good idea
some of we at saturday night live
think Kaufmans a comic genius
but
other disagree
they say he be
just not funny anymore
so we be putting the decision up to
you
please call up and vote
to
keep andy call
to
he call

this be bad
i only get
percent
i be like mcgovern in


and this be not merv
this be
the hip audience on television
they have turn on you

it be like you two guy wanted to
destroy Andys career
upsetting
all those people
putting out that
toxic venom
what do you would happen

we be just trying to push the
envelope

you be
there be no envelope
anymore
it hurt i to say this
but
there be only one solution
i do not want you two to ever work
together again

i be sorry
we think it be
funny

jer it be not you fault
you be
terrific
but maybe george be right

that be fine
but i would not have
trade it for anything
because for one brief shine
moment
the world think that
wrestle be real

we will stay in touch
next time i be
in memphis i will stop by the house
and noreen can make i she double
chocolate cake

close you eye
open you eye
close you eye
open you eye
close you eye

excuse i andy

yes you holiness

this be very difficult for i to
say
but perhaps it would be
best if you do not attend the
retreat

why
i
i attend every year

yes we do not doubt you devotion
to
but we feel that perhaps
you and the program have grow apart
philosophically

philosophically

the wrestle
the sexist
remark
the foul language
these thing be not becoming of an
enlighten individual
it seem you have no respect for
anything

of course i do

please
you have to let i take
the class
it be how i keep myself


it be apparently not working

so
all i want to do be


andy do not raise you voice
we
do not wish you presence here


go away



it be i
