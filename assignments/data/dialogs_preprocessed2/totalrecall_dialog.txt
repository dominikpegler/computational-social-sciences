incision in you neck just
below the leave ear and

the
spray cartridge contain a
local anesthetic and a blood

careful it be i
neck too

where

he be in that old flophouse
plaza hotel

sir

there must be something some
place he would go some friend
he would run to

to Cohaagen
quietly
they lost he

again

be you sure the original
suppression take

absolutely sir
he think
he be quail a computer

then how do you explain what
he be do

just he instinct
he be
well trained by
i

maybe
the memory cape fracture
portion of he prior identity
could be leak through

he will remember mars
the
sphinx project

fragment
nothing more
nothing he could piece together
i do advise terminating he
rather than implant an
identify alternative

what do you think i be

barbarian
we be not living
in the twentieth century

hold it there



if he have to travel to mars

lady and gentleman if you will
glance out the starboard
viewport you will behold an
indeed awesome sight





those long gorge you see
clearly be the legendary
canal of mars



of course they be not manmade
canal but vast natural chasm
many deep and large than
the grand canyon
though
utterly without moisture now
scientist have determined
that they be form by
massive flooding millions of
year ago





surface temperature at the
martian equator be minus
onehundred and twenty degree
centigrade in winter
fortunately this time of year
it be slightly more seasonable
sixty degree fahrenheit
outside the dome
please remember folk that
outside the dome you will need
to carry you own personal
oxygen supply at all time
the atmosphere of mars be
almost a vacuum

nodding to
quail
you servant Fahreem Kuato
i greet you by the
twentyseven name that still
remain praying that you cast
jewel into the darkness and
given they to glow with the
color of life

what use be this weirdo

ssssh
there be skill on
mar that earth have forgotten

no need to introduce yourself
mr
quail
smile at quail
surprise
tolerate i presumption but
it do not tax i power to
know that you be the most
soughtafter man on two
world

this way i dear man
we
have much to accomplish
and very little time


van in the outside street can be hear from time to
to time
they be repeating the evacuation message
from scene but alternating it with a call for the
apprehension of quail and melina

for information leading to
these arrest firstclass
travel to earth will be
provide plus a weekend at
the leningrad disneyworld
all expense paid
i repeat
an oriental girl and Earthman
possibly to be find in the
company of a black taxi driver
these be dangerous subversive
and swear enemy of the
glorious people republic of
mars


the turbulence you hear
outside be but a reflection
of the turmoil within you
you have bring it to mars
in you search for yourself

and you be going to help i
by reading i mind

indubitably
there be only
small matter of a fee

fee

naturally

this be for we because

income before ideal
shall
we say fivehundredthousand
dollar

Fivehundredthousand martian
dollar that be
think
calculating the
exchange rate

not martian dollar mr
quail earth dollar

that be interplanetary robbery

with today exchange rate
that be over two million
martian dollar

what price do you put mr
quail on the future of the
solar system

aw come off it man
just

with a crystal ball

he manner
slipping

practice commission might
be interest in this

retrieve the past be like
walking backwards along a
perilous road
the
halfrecalled the
halfforgotten the repress
the fantasy the triumph
joy failure betrayal

yes
i can feel it
a
wall

trance to break through
i will be scanning you through
the oracle head

do not fear i
i need you

and the salvation of mars
be waiting for you in the
crown of the sphinx

phobos and demos
what be
that all about

be you okay
charles
doug
whoever

even he voice
have changed
i be fine
only i be not
doug i be charles hauser
and i know everything hauser
know

bennie where be you depot

well
you go outta here
take a left then down past
the first
no second
water bureau you

can you get we there

no problem

but why

we be going to the sphinx

impossible man
guard
everywhere

the oracle
what do you
learn

only everything
i have get
total recall





we will never get near the
sphinx
they will blow we
apart

what be we do charles
for god sake tell we

the sphinx
it be not some
useless artifact it be a
machine build by some alien
race eighteen millions year
ago
the same race that
build the on one earth
for the same purpose

this be what we need

refer to the
sphinx
it be a hunk of old stone
man

purpose
what purpose

come on bennie move it
have you hear the word
terriform





calling to
guard
just deliverin some old junk
to the mine out at Apidalia
Planitia
get they people
you be lookin for in the
back as well

the machine in the sphinx be
tapped straight down to the
molten core of this planet
there be tunnel and duct
everywhere all powered by
fusion generator

you sure the little man
do not fry you brain quail

for what
to do what

to combine element in the
martian core and release
they as oxygen hydrogen
and nitrogen

that be air



that be right
air and water
Terriforming will create a
permanent livable environment
for mars
no more pressurize
city no more container in
the desert
Therell be
river vegetation life
the same as earth

so why be Cohaagen ship
everyone out

do not you see
from be
a pile of red dirt with
mineral mars be going to
change into a chunk of
priceless real estate

and Cohaagens going to own
it all

right
he can start selling
it off to wellheeled investor
from earth
beach condo ski
resort you name it

no wonder he wanted you to
penetrate
out group

once word of this get out
the whole planet will support
you



so what can we do

ruin he little scheme by
terriforming ahead of
schedule while the
inhabitant be still here

but who will work the machine
do you know how

i be the only one who do
why do you think Cohaagens
left i alone all this time



i be the first one inside
when they cracked the riddle
of the sphinx
it must have
be programme
some kind
of
force
shoot into i

but Cohaagen wipe you
memory

just a way of putting i on
ice
he would of reversed it
once the planet be evacuate

man
this be real complicate
go over it again real slow



ignore benny
aside
what he have not count on be
you effect on i

and all without the marvel
of modern science





bennie do not stop now take
it

you bastard

like i said
it be a tough
planet
i be a baddie not
a goodie

i should have known you
be just too helpful

rule one man
trust
nobody
now you can do
you terriforming stuff
right when those space
shuttle be go

but what about the martian
people
out because
i think
you believe in it

you because
that bunch of
dead beat radical
when i
hand in this little number
flick he gun
in quail face
i will get real estate right
on the whole of Chryse
Planitia





this make bennie a cut above
anyone else













shout over
engine noise
hope i have get this direction
right



the air supply be off under
the dome

yes sir

hour it will be all go

any trouble with the rabble

not much sir

all head towards the
shuttle area



we get in with this thing
but we will never get back out

shame
such a pleasant
trip



point down
shaft
this be the main tap
straight down to the core
of mars
when we trigger
the mechanism fusion
reactor will detonate down
there four hundred mile
deep

remind i not to slip

the new element will come
booming up through this
shaft and six thousand
other all around the
planet

if quail the only one who
can operate all this
gesture toward
Sphinxs control
then he can call all the
shot

we will tell he the computer
worked out the operational
detail so we do not really
need he
we be just do
