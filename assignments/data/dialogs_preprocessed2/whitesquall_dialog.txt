though i have not see or spoken to
sheldrake in over thirty year it
seem impossible that he heart be
the thing that have finally failed
he



i never get close to he nobody
do
but by the time we make tampa
i be sure i know who he be that i
understood what he see what
nourish he soul and test his
faith



he have taken we to worship where
what be for he the holy of
holy
and for we too by the
end






i do not know richard sheldrake
personally but he many friend who
know and worked with he wanted to
make sure that he be return home
here to be remember with his
beloved wife



though he have moved on with his
life now even for the year to
hear he eulogize by stranger
seem strange
he have be a
hewner of stone a pilot by the
silent star
like i alone among
many
but most of all for we the
crew of the brigantine albatross he
be always and would forever be
we skipper

blow that could knock the bridge off
a battleship
reef and rock and
sandbar that tear the belly from
she and enough fog and night to hide
it all

so look out there
and explain to
i why any man in possession of any
sense at all would take on the sea

the ship beneath you be not a toy
and sail be not a game
the
albatross will take we far

attention

do fine
oh and one more thing
there be nothing that go on on
this boat that i do not know about

not even a little

nothing like experience to put
thing in perspective

will you shut up
you sound like i
fuck sister

alright
everybody just stay cool
we will figure this out

who the hell checked the moor

i do
why

maybe she pulled free

what if they do not know
if she be
adrift if they be asleep she could
run aground
she could break up on
the reef

maybe you do not check it good
enough

defensive
frighten
i do
i swear

yeah well you be really going to have
some bad dream if we find out you
do not

that be enough

how the hell be we going to get outta
here

we will think of something

oh praise the lord
relax everybody
everything be
under control
the jug head going
to think of something

nobody call i an idiot

god damn it man
i think he broke
i nose

shut up phil

well that be just great
now what
be we suppose to do

Ohmygod

i be not sure if this be really good
or really bad

i get a live one

the thing about fish george be
you need to let they run some
give
they just enough slack so they do not
break the line
but at the same
time you have get to keep enough
tension to wear they down bring they
in slowly so they do not really know
they be hook

i will try and remember that

you know what a loose cannon be
bout the bad thing that could
happen to a wooden ship
all it
take be one crashing around the
deck in a storm
it would smash
everything in it way maybe take
out a mast or punch a hole right
through the hull
think about it
just one cannon not tied down not
anchore could take a whole man of
war straight to the bottom

but we do not have any cannon

shut up

now if the skipper be smart if
he could see a storm building why
he would cut loose every gun on his
boat
even though it would leave
he at a disadvantage in battle
he would push they into the sea
well
chance running for port than risk
the entire ship he crew

people be like that sometimes
they cut loose and before you know
it they be knocking hole in
everything
so you get to ask
yourself if it might not be good
to just put they off before they sink
the whole thing
i mean after all
you can always get new cannon

i want a tight ship everybody
shave and in clean clothes when we
make curacao
if it go well if
you mid term be acceptable i may
reconsider i decision about the
rest of the trip
that be all

where you going

to take a piss

really

in and shake it for i

oh god

you okay kid

chuck

when we be growing up i always
feel like you would take care of
thing that everything would be
okay
but you can not make this okay can
you

no i can not

there be allegation questioning
you competence with regard to the
command of the albatross
i have
be instruct to convene a formal
tribunal to determine whether or not
negligence play a part in the
sink

i understand

may i ask you something

how do you manage to piss off a guy
as powerful as francis Boutillier

it be not hard

i used to helm a school ship

long time ago

the coast guard eagle
she never
lost a race while you be skipper

that be right we do not
i miss it
sometimes
but there be other
thing a skipper can do

the family
want you ticket
turn it in we forget the whole
thing
everybody go home

absolutely not

the paper be going to eat you
alive
even if you beat it you will
never get another commission
they want someone to be accountable

i be accountable

we get to talk

we be all going to have to testify
they be going to try to take his
license

why

they need it to be simple
they
need a reason

who

all of they
everybody waiting on
that dock

so what be we suppose to do

just tell they what we know and be
do with it
that be what he would
want

easy for you to say

what be that suppose to mean

everybody know why she go over
tod
you jibe the boat

i be trying to get she up wind
that be what you do when you be hit
abeam
or maybe you be too stupid
to know that

that be not what skipper think
he
be trying to spill air from the
main

it be coming four point off the
bow terry
he never could have
get she around

be you on deck
i be standing
right there and all i know be he
disobey an order twice and
the boat go over

it do not go over til i turned she
starboard

it be an act of god for christs
sake

it be an act of stupidity

be it i fault we be running all
that sail
be it i fault she
be not dogged down

i
could not help that the ballast
shift
you son of a bitch
it be not i fault
it be not

it be okay tod

then whose

after the lightning strike we tried
to go aloft to drop sail
we would do
it a thousand time
we do not have
to wait for an order
but skipper
called we down

if the foremast have taken a strike
everyone in the rig would have
be fried
what would you have
do

we would have scalloped the square
from the deck
right bill

that be right that be right
bleed
the sail from the deck and she
could have taken a hurricane

this be crazy
nothing could have
prevent what happen

you guy be missing the point
this be all because of phil
phil
and he dear old dad

what

how do you think they get this
together so fast
he be be laying
for skipper since the first day

come on
like he be get a vendetta
or some such shit

you get it
i told you he be a turn coat the
day we kick he off the boat

no
you be wrong

i be telling you the only way to
change this be to get phil to call
off he old man
and that be not
going to happen
so the way i see it
it be skipper or we

can we talk

i guess



who be it philip

it be okay
i will be in in a minute
look what do you want

Everybodys saying this whole
tribunal be happening because of
you father
because of you

well that be just typical be not it

be it true phil

i get to go

you be not there you do not know
what happen

i know enough

phil please
it will not change
anything
tell he to call it off



who be you talking to out there
philip
come back in here

i be sorry

wait

we figure he would have wanted you to
have it
you do what you have get to do phil

the united states coast guard have
be ask to conduct this maritime
hearing to consider the revocation
of captain richard Sheldrakes you

master seamans certificate

why do not you drop any sail

skipper called we out of the
rig

but you instinct be to lose sail

i instinct be to not get
electrocute

how old be you son

fifteen

thank you

philip why be you discharge from
the albatross

skipper think i be a challenge to
authority

be you

i do not know

captain sheldrake exhibited an
arrogant control attitude in i
presence on more than one occasion
i believe he have a personality
conflict with i son from the start

well if you do not mind i ask
sir why do you let you son stay

it be he dream to go
i could
hardly stand in the way of that
could i

be it true that you forced robin
weather to climb the mast when it
be clear that he be acrophobic

he climb when he be ready

be you aware that he brother be
killed in a fall

he do it man
he sing like a bird

yes i be

sir be you aware at any time of
the use of alcohol among the crew

yes i be

and you do not do anything about it

no
i do not

they be twist it all around
why
do not he say something

have you ever see a white squall
before this incident

no

what make you so sure it be one

i can not be sure

you really feel that you crew be
up for the condition

we would come twelve thousand mile
together through every kind of sea
imaginable

except a white squall
with all due respect captain
sheldrake they be only boy

they be much more than that sir

be it true that the reason you
expel philip Boutillier

for killing a dolphin

and that you invited he to
strike you
to fight it out on the
deck of you ship

yes that be true

do you think this be funny
some
kind of joke
you lost six people
out there

i do not think one second of this be
funny sir

i have no more question at this
time

oh one last thing
be not true
that you father be a sea captain

yes

be not also true that he vessel go
down off of nantucket
lose
everyone on board
in fair weather
no less

what do this have to do with
anything mr
sanders

oh nothing
i be just curious

i father be more seaman more of
a man than you might ever hope to
be

we will take a brief recess

there be still a way

what do you mean

it be i do not you see
Terrys
right i be the escape hatch
i
disobey order

you taking the order would not have
changed anything

they do not know that
we be the only one on deck
look there be nothing they can do to
i right
i be a kid

but that be not the point

that be the point
and Skipperll
slip off the hook

why do not you turn hard to port as
the wind hit

i think we would have a good chance
if i headed into the wind so we
could spill air from we sail

but the captain ordered you hard to
starboard

twice

be that what you be trained to do

no

then what do you think he be trying
to do

let the blow drive the boat down
wind
neutralize we canvas

so when the captain give you an
order contrary to you train you
think he be making a mistake

no

then why son why do not you follow
he order

because i panicked

that be not true tod

what the hell
what be he do

son of a gun
he just send skipper
a life boat

if this young man have respond
instantly to you command do you
believe the ship might have be
spare

i do not know that anything could
have prevent what happen

then what be you trying to say
then

maybe you can not see what be happening
here but it be clear to i
i appreciate what you be trying to
do tod
maybe you could live with
it but i could not
if you think i be going to let a
sixteen year old take
responsibility then you
underestimate i
the albatross be
i ship
the ocean academy be i
school
she loss be mine and mine
alone
i can not bring you son back
if
you want i ticket if that will
ease you loss it be the least i
can do
this

this be easy
living with it
that be hard

no
do not you walk away
not
now
not after all of this

that enough son
order
please

tell i skipper be it all just a
lie
where we go one we go all
we listen to you
we believe it
and we be still here

shame on you then skipper
shame on
you

sit down

tell they the truth
make they
understand

you tell they chuck

it be simple
bad thing happen
sometimes
it be not skipper or
tod
it be all of we
everyone in
this room
because we all know the
risk
you send we
you paid we tuition
you allowed we to go
so to invent
a reason for why this happen to
pin it on one person well that
will not change anything
it will just
make we experience meaningless

if you want to judge this man judge
he by he crew
judge he by alice
and george
chris and john and
robin
in one way or another each
one of they give they live saving
one of we
this may sound crazy but
the albatross be not just a ship or
even a school
it be something
that we make that be inside we
that be who skipper be
that be what
he taught we
i guess what it
really be about be
the
privilege of sacrifice

be not that right

that be right

when the sun come up there be
whisky in the cup and not a one of
we be sober

jenny think she see a picture when
it really be the sun then we know
the party be over

oh i heart be sad for leaving you
today but i know we will meet again
when the moon be in the valley and
the leaf be on the tree we will
come to clearly in the glen

what do you think you be do

all right friend out of the boat

stand away



they do not take he ticket that
day
but why he never return to
the sea i would never know
perhaps he
have not be able to free himself
from the anchor of grief that have
driven he to he knee aboard the
gran rio or that he no longer care
for the solitude and isolation of
command without he alice
or maybe
it be just that the wave that have
spoken to he for so long have grow
silent
whatever it be that
thing it have always troubled i
because fate offer up no reason
and maybe that be what i have
travele these thirty four year to
say
maybe that be all i really
know
and that one man care

rest easy old salt
for together
again we will sail




some time later we learned that one
of we long boat have be
recovered
several young man find
it washed up on a nameless beach
somewhere on the island of
hispaniola
no one seem to know
who they be or where they come
from but they seem to know of the
albatross
sometimes in i dream those
faceless young man reveal themselves
as i lose companion and on the
twilight coral sand of forever
between i slumber and conscious
state we race naked again so open
and in love with those precious
moment running ever laugh
ever young ever free
