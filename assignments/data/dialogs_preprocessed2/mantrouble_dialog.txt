especially socorro who can not

and sometimes she have to go
pulling he from room to room
like a vacuum cleaner

no that be just normal in most of
you adult male
some percentage
of the time they be going to attempt
to make these vulgar motion on
you person
he place he arm on the couch behind she

you just have to be very firm and
stay on top of he
in the sky beyond the hill a helicopter beam it light


joan and harry be seated on the couch have coffee as
they listen to a
he be do he good

he lean over and kiss she
after a moment she break

not averse to
be one of
they
Uhm hmm

not

you know i be not one of these
guy who be going to look upon you
