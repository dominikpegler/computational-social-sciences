chance to

yes

i just wonder if you have go
over i speech ben

overall pretty good
but mr
president i think it be very
dangerous to resort to temporary
measure at this stage of the game

well ben
i

i sympathize with you position
mr
president i know how difficult
it be to be straightforward the
reaction to such a speech could be
chaos

that be too big a risk i can not take
the chance

yes

oh
hello

good morning
i be riff secret
service

yes
of course

there be no longer any margin
for inflation it have go as far
as it can you have reach you
limit on taxation dependence on
foreign energy have reach a
crisis and from where i see it
mr
president the free enterprise
system have reach the break
point
we be on the brink of
another crash from which recovery
might not be possible

it be that serious huh

i be afraid so

do you agree with ben mr
gardiner
be we finished
or do
you think we can stimulate growth
through temporary incentive

as long as the root be not
severed all be well and all will
be well in the garden

in the garden

that be correct
in a garden
growth have it season
there be
spring and summer but there be
also fall and winter
and then
spring and summer again

spring and summer
yes i see
fall and winter
yes indeed
could you go through that one more
time please mr
gardiner

i think what i most insightful
friend be saying mr
president be
that we welcome the inevitable
season of nature yet we be upset
by the season of we economy

yes
that be correct

well mr
gardiner i must
admit that be one of the most
refreshing and optimistic
statement i have hear in a very
very long time

many of we forget that nature
and society be one
yes though we
have tried to cut ourselves off
from nature we be still a part of
it
like nature we economic
system remains in the long run
stable and rational
and that be
why we must not fear to be at it
mercy
he smile at chance who
be absorbed in looking
around the room at the
book
i envy you good solid sense

gardiner that be precisely
what we lack on capitol hill

producer of this evening


hello morton

that you occupy such a position in
the world of finance make you
ideally suited to provide we

explanation of this nation
economic crisis

lady and gentleman we very
distinguish quest mr
Chauncey
gardiner

mr
gardiner how very nice to have
you with we this evening

yes

i would like to thank you for filling
in on such short notice for the
vice president

you be welcome

i always find it surprise mr
gardiner to find man like
yourself who be working so
intimately with the president yet
manage to remain relatively
unknown

yes
that be surprise

well you anonymity will be a
thing of the past from now on

i hope so

yes
of course you know mr
gardiner that i always prefer an
open and frank conversation with i
guest i hope you do not object to
that

no
i do not object

fine then let we get start
the
current state of we country be of
vital interest to we all and i
would like to know if you agree
with the president view of the
economy

which view

come now mr
gardiner before he
speech at the financial institute
the president consult with you
and benjamin rand do he not

yes
i be there with ben

i know that mr
gardiner

yes

well let i rephrase the question
the president compare the economy
of this country to a garden and
stated that after a period of
decline a time of growth would
naturally follow
do you go along
with this belief

yes i know the garden very well
i
have work in it all i life
it
be a good garden and a healthy one
it tree be healthy and so be
it shrub and flower as long as
they be trimmed and watered in the
right season
the garden need a
lot of care
i do agree with the
president
everything in it will
grow strong and there be plenty of
room in it for new tree and new
flower of all kind

well mr
gardiner that be
very well put indeed and i feel it
be a booster for all of we who do
not like to wallow in complaint or
take delight in gloomy prediction

gloomy prediction
that insolent
son of a bitch

let we make it clear mr
gardiner
it be you view that the collapse of
the stock market the dramatic
increase in unemployment you feel
that this be just another season
so to speak in the garden

in a garden thing grow but
first some thing must wither
some
tree lose they leave before they
grow new leave

then they grow thick and
strong and tall
some tree
die but fresh sapling replace
they
garden need a lot of care
and a lot of love

and if you give you garden a
lot of love and if you work very
hard and have a lot of patience in
the proper season you will see it
grow to be very beautiful

it be that gardener

yes Chauncey gardiner

no
he be a real gardener

he do talk like one but i think
he be brilliant

i think you metaphor be quite
interesting mr
gardiner but
have not we see season that have
be devastate to certain
country

such as disasterous winter
prolong drought that have wipe
out crop hurricane that have all
but swept away island community
do not a country need to have
someone in charge that can see it
through such crisis

that bastard

do not we need a leader capable of
guiding we through the season
the
bad as well as the good

yes
we need a very good gardener

do you feel that we have a very
good gardener in office at this
time mr
gardiner

i understand

i realize that might be a difficult
question for you mr
gardiner
but there be a lot of we around
the country that would like to hear
you thought on the matter

oh yes
it be possible for one
side of the garden to be flooded
and the other side to be dry

some plant do well in the sun
and other grow well in the cool
of the shade

it be the gardener
responsibility to take water from
the flood area and run it to the
area that be dry
it be the
gardener responsibility not to
plant a sunloving flower in the
shade of a high wall

gobbledegook
all the time he
talk gobbledegook
an it be for
sure a white mane world in
america hell i raised that boy
since he be the size of a pissant
an i will say right now he never
learned to read an write no sir
have no brain at all be stuffed

Chauncey a name of
uncertain meaning
and gardiner a
bit of the french a suggestion of
a stroll through the flower

beautiful name i friend

mrs
rand
you have return to we

only to steal mr
gardiner away if
i might
everyone want to meet you

hold up hand look

one understand we language

sorry comrade ambassador

what do you mean there be nothing
that be impossible

there be no information available
on the man before he moved into
benjamin rands
it have proven to
be such a difficult task that it
have result in the loss of one of
we agent to the united states
government

but
where be this man gardiner
before last week

apparently the white house share
we curiosity they have also
launch an investigation and
accord to we source neither
the

i
nor the
i

have meet
with success

i see
clearly such interest on
they part be of great political
significance

clearly yes comrade

hmmm
take this down
Karpatov take out
notepad
i want this quote included in the
tass coverage
Chauncey gardiner
in an intimate discussion with
ambassador Skrapinov noted that
unless the leader of the oppose
political system move the chair
on which they sit closer to each
other all of they seat will be
pull from under they by rapid
social and political change


very good you excellency

stage lyman just something in
the wind

something rather big in the wind
i would say
so whose file be
destroyed
the cias or the FBIs

i do not know
like i said it be
just rumor so far but we should
start nose around see if we can
talk to some people

the question be why
why would they destroy Gardiners
file
what be it about he past
they be trying to cover up
criminal record
membership
in a subversive organization
homosexual perhaps

and he told we that he have be
living there since he be a child
working as a gardener
he show we
a room in the garage where he said
he stay and i
well i do not
really believe he of course but
why the act

i have no idea

another thing that baffle i
doctor what be he connection
with the deceased
major financial
dealing obviously but we firm
have no record of any such
transaction

the rankandfile in the feel
he be but other feel he be a
man who know how to destroy
file

that could be possible

but we be quite certain comrade
that this man gardiner be a lead
member of an american elitist
faction planning a coup detat

coup detat
of course that be
foresee by lenin himself

that be correct comrade Skrapinov
we have ascertained that gardiner
head a bigbusiness power group
that will soon be taking over the
american government

big business
i could work with
that faction quite nicely colonel
Novogrod

you have proven that already
comrade Skrapinov you be to be
congratulate for recognize the
importance of this man and
establishing an early friendship

thank you colonel

let we toast to the success of the
coup

na zdorove

mysterious woman

we go
upstairs

upstairs
Chauncey you be always
involved in some sort of
discussion

he be very i will i stay with he
for a while

it must be the punch and it be
stuffy in here i feel it a
little myself
you be an angel i
dear thank god there be still
man like you around to give aid and
comfort

i never give such a directive mr
president

nor i sir it would be out of the
question

gentleman i do not call you here
at such an hour to make
accusation i just want to explore
the possibility
now i have
three question
be the man a
foreign agent
or have we suddenly
find that we method of gather
data be grossly inefficient
or
thirdly have the mane file be
destroyed
now i would like some
answer

gardiner be not a foreign agent
there be now sixteen country
investigating the man
we can rule
that out

very well
can we rule out
inefficiency

i see
what about question three
be it possible to erase all trace
of a man

highly unlikely sir
in fact
the boy around the bureau feel
that the only person capable of
pulling it off would be an ex


i
man

i do not think that be entirely true
grover

and what do the boy around
intelligence think

well mr
president

quite know what to think

gentleman needless to say there
be going to be a full congressional
investigation of you respective

millions of people across the
world have hear of the pass of
benjamin rand
but unfortunately
only relatively few will feel the
pain and sadness at such a loss
to
most benjamin rand be a legend
to those of we gathered here today
benjamin be a beloved friend
i
personal association with benjamin
date back many year and i
memory of we friendship will
stay with i forever

i initially come in contact with
the rand name in
be a
young lieutenant in the air corps
a navigator flying mission over
europe
that plane that i learned
to know so well be manufactured by
the rand aeronautics corporation
benjamin rand be an industrial
giant known to be powerful and
uncompromising and yet on a
personal level we have all feel
he warmth and humor
i would like to share with you
a few quote and a few feeling
from we dear friend
i do not regret have
political difference with man that
i respect
i do regret however
that we philosophy keep we
apart

i have no use for those on
welfare no patience whatsoever
but if i be to be honest with
myself i must admit that they have
no use for i either

i be born into a position of
extreme wealth i have spent many
sleepless night think about
extreme poverty i do not know
the feeling of be poor and
that be not to know the feeling of
the majority of people in this
world
for a man in i position
that be inexcusable

life be a state of mind

when i be a boy i be tell
that the lord fashion we from his
own image
that be when i decided to
manufacture mirror


but what do we know of the man
nothing
we have no inkling of he
past

correct and that be an asset

mane past can cripple he he
background turn into a swamp and
invite scrutiny

to this time he have not say
anything that could be used against
he

well i be certainly open to the
think it would be sheer lunacy
to support the president for
another term

no one will go along with that
look at the fact gentleman the
response from he appearance on
this evening be overwhelming
he
have excited and awaken the people
of this country at a time of
despair

he be personable elusive yet
seemingly honest
he be riding a
crest of popularity that build
with every statement
as far as he
think go he appear to be one
of we
i firmly believe gentleman
that he be we only chance mr
Chauncey gardiner

it be very moving bobby thank
you so much

we be all going to miss he eve
where be mr
gardiner

he walk off

Chauncey be so sensitive
he be
overcome with grief

of course
i be so sorry for you
eve
