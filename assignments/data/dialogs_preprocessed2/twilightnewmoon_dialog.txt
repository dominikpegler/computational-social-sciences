night

there be bad tragedy than a
birthday
look at romeo
he be
responsible for he wife death
who
could live with that
though i do envy he one thing

Juliets alright
if you like that
obviously beautiful sort of thing

not the girl the suicide
nearly impossible for i kind
but
human a little poison dagger to the
heart
there be so many option

why would you even think about that

i considered it
once
when james
have you trapped

i do not know if i would find you in time
if i would get you killed

it would not have be you fault


either way i have a plan

what plan

there be
way for we
at least
one way
i would have go to italy
provoke the Volturi

the who


be there something you would like to share
with the class edward

certainly not
but i apologize for
be a distraction
perhaps you
should rewind to act five scene one
line twentyeight eightynine
if you have the strength of twenty man
it would dispatch you straight



eye on the screen people



the Volturi be a very old very
powerful family



the close thing i world have to
royalty


francesco solimena painted this
he
often depicted the Volturi as god

be that
carlisle

yes
he live with they for a few
decade
he describe they as very
refined for killer



the Volturi be also what you might
call enforcer



of what



the only rule they have
to keep
secret the existence of we kind




we do not make spectacle of ourselves
or kill conspicuously unless we want
to die

do not even talk about that
you
can not let anyone hurt you
the
Volturi or anyone else

who else would hurt i

you said there be more dangerous
thing out there than you
and i know
you have at least one enemy



you said she would come after you for
killing she mate

victoria
yes some day
but alice
will see she coming
and she will not win

i hate that i can not protect you


that be i be serious

i know
but you do protect i
from boredom
and loneliness
you give i a reason to stay
un
dead
but it be
i job
to protect
you

from everyone but i sister

it be time it be time it be time

please do not make i choose
because it will be he
it be always
be he


but you know how important you be to



there be problem ahead
seemingly
insurmountable



if i do not become a vampire the
Volturi would kill i
if i do i
good friend would do the job himself
or get killed in the attempt



victoria be still on the loose
putting everyone i loved in danger



but i would already survive the bad
losing edward
so i know i could
survive anything

i be here
always



and soon i would be like he
we would face
we fate together
forever
