shortstop that be bat
the
poor kid be once mixed up in a hold
up
but he be trying to go straight
except there be a bunch of gambler
who will not let he

so they tell the kid to throw the
world series or else huh

more or less
only for the end
i have get a gimmick that be real good

get a title

base/basis loaded
there be a Opage
outline

get the reader department and
see what they have on base/basis loaded

they be pretty hot about it
over at twentieth but i

shortstop
you have get the good
man for it right here on this lot
alan ladd
good change of pace for
alan ladd
there be another thing
it be pretty simple to shoot
lot
of outdoor stuff
bet you could
make the whole thing for under a
million
and there be a great little
part for bill Demarest
one of the
trainer an oldtime player who
get beaned and go out of he head
sometimes

hello mr
sheldrake
on that base/basis
loaded
i covered it with a page
synopsis
but i would not bother

what be wrong with it

it be from hunger

nothing for ladd

be not very good to begin with

i be sure you will be glad to meet
mr
gillis

just do not think it be any good
i find it flat and banal

exactly what kind of material do

kid
just a story will not do
you would have turn down go with the
wind

no that be i
i said who

loaded be that i know you name

talent

this year
i be trying to earn a live

so you take plot make it
glossy make it slick
