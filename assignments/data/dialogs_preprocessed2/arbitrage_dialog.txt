i just go to
eat some ice cream

be it good

yes

good
do not forget to take you Lipitor in
the morning

ellen

what

do you still love i

of course i do

hypothetically the situation
you be describe would be
involuntary manslaughter

and such a person

would be in a lot of trouble
especially if that person be closing
a merger with a large public bank
where any publicity or arrest could
delay or derail the transaction
goldenrod



but that be only if there be some
evidence that could link he to
the crime

fingerprint

very hard to collect after an explosion
the real world different from television

what about cell phone record

do this person make any call from the area

not from a cell phone no

then they will not be able to place he there

what would you advise such a person
to do

to confess immediately

fail which

to put as much distance between himself
and the event as possible if possible
but let i tell you something and i be
speaking to you as a friend now
there
be about fifty thing that person
would not have think of
and the more
time that pass the more lie that
be tell the bad it get for he

robert

yeah

they be going to come to you
goldenrod



i know

an accident not the bad
trouble
if we talk to they now we
can probably work it out

you tell i what happen if the
standard deal do not close and i
get to tell i investor about we
real loss

nothing good

and what you say about the justice
department
depend on what they
decide to arrest i on fraud
conviction get i twenty year

i do

what choice do i really have

you be aware congress plan to
extend the audit requirement for
private fund

of course i be aware
i give
testimony to the committee
you know this
goldenrod



well standard want to prepare for
it now
so i be ask to go through
every one of you trade book and
reconfirm they asset

no
absolutely not
that be impossible

do not worry
i put the team on
different book and i left old
hill for myself
anyway i be here to tell you i
clear it

the audit clear

the report will be issued today
actually i be calling it i swan song


you be leaving

yeah on friday it be a fiveyear clock

and why

uhh
to prevent exactly what we be
do
but honestly there be nothing
left to worry about

fuck idiot

sign once they get the audit report

that be be issued now
