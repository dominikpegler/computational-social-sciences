you be looking for a bomb

i know that
but the threat be called
in for the federal build across the
street

i think they have that covered

mulder
when a terrorist bomb threat
be called in the logical purpose of
provide this information be to allow
we to find the bomb
the rational
object of terrorism be to promote
terror
if you would study model
behavioral pattern in virtually every
case where a threat have turn up an
explosive device
if we do not act in
accordance with that data if you
ignore it as we have do the
chance be great that if here
actually be a bomb we might not find
it
live could be lost

mulder

what happen to playing a hunch

jesus mulder

the element of surprise scully
random act of unpredictability
if we
fail to anticipate the unforeseen or
expect the unexpected in a universe of
infinite possibility we find
ourselves at the mercy of anyone or
anything that cannot be programme
categorize or easily referenced

what be we do up here

next time you be buying



in light of waco and ruby ridge




there be a heighten need at the
attorney general office to place
responsibility as early as possible

for the catastrophic destruction of
public property and the loss of life
due to terrorist activity

many detail be still unclear
some
agent report have not be file
or have come in sketchy without a
satisfactory account of the event
that lead to the destruction in dallas
but we be under some pressure to give
an accurate picture of what happen
to the attorney general so she can
issue a public statement

we now know that five people die in
the explosion
special agent in charge
darius Michaud who be trying to
defuse the bomb that have be hidden
in a vend machine
three fireman
from dallas and a young boy

excuse i the fireman and the boy
they be in the build

agent mulder since you be not able
to be on time for this hear i be
going to ask you to step outside so
that we can get agent Scullys version
of the fact
so that she will not have
to be paid the same disrespect

we be tell the build be clear

you will get you turn agent mulder
please step out

it do say there in you paperwork
that we be the one who find the
bomb

thank you agent mulder
we will call
you in shortly


sit down they be still talking to
agent scully

about what

they be asking she for a narrative
they want to know why she be in the
wrong build

she be with i

you do not see what be going on here do
you
there be four hundred million dollar
in damage to the city of dallas
live
have be lost
no suspect have be
named
so the story be shaped be
this could have be prevent
that
the do not do it job

and they want to blame we

agent mulder we both know that if
you and agent scully have not taken the
initiative to search the adjacent
build you could have multiply
the fatality by a hundred

but it be not the live we saved
it be
the live we do not

if it look bad it be bad for the


if they want someone to blame
they can blame i
agent scully
do not deserve this

she be in there right now saying the
same thing about you

i breach protocol
i broke contact
with the


i ignore a primary
tactical rule and left he alone with
the device

agent scully say it be she who
ordered you out of the build
that
you wanted to go back

they be asking for you sir

whatever you told they in there you
do not have to protect i

all i told they be the truth

they be trying to divide we on this
scully
we can not let they

they have divided we mulder
they be
split we up

what
what be you talking about

i meet with the day after tomorrow
for remediation and reassignment

why

i think you must have an idea
they
cited a history of problem relate
back to

they be the one that put we
together

because they wanted i to invalidate
you work you investigation into
the paranormal
but i think this go
deeper than that

this be not about you scully
they be
do this to i

they be not do this mulder
i left behind a career in medicine
because i think i might make a
difference at the
when they
recruited i they told i woman make
up nine percent of the bureau
i feel
this be not an impediment but an
opportunity to distinguish myself
but
it have not turn out that way
and
now if i be to be transferred to
omaha or wichita or some field office
where i be sure i could rise it just
do not hold the interest for i it
once do
not after what i have see and
do

you be
quit

there be really no reason left for i
to stay anymore
maybe you should ask yourself if you
heart still in it too

agent mulder
you be up

i be sorry
good luck


i would say this about exceed you
minimum daily requirement

get to train for this kind of heavy
lift

Poopy day

yup

woman
work

what do you do

what do i do
i be a key figure in an ongoing
government charade
an annoyance to i
superior
joke among i peer
spooky they call i
spooky mulder
whose sister be abducted by alien
when he be a kid
who now chase
little green man with a badge and a
gun shouting to the heaven and
anyone who will listen that the fix be
in
that we government hip to the
truth and a part of the conspiracy
that the sky be falling and when it
hit it be going to be the shitstorm of
all time

i think that about do it spooky

do what

why do not you go home to the old lady


sorry
do not have one

that official business

what

bet the bureau accusing you of the
same thing in dallas

how be that

standing around holding you yank
while bomb be explode

do i know you

no
i have be watch you career for
a good while
back when you be just
a promise young agent before
that

you follow i out here for a reason

yeah i do

i name Kurtzweil
dr
alvin
Kurtzweil

i know the name
why

old friend of you father

back at the department of state
we
be what you might call fellow
traveler but he disenchantment
outlast mine
i never believe in the project

oh come on
do not pretend you do not
know about the project
you father
die for it
you sister be taken
because of it


how do you find i

hear you come here now and again
figure you would be need a little
drinky tonight

you a reporter

i be a doctor but i think i mention
that


who send you

i come on i own
after reading about
the bomb in dallas

well if you have get something to tell
i you have get as long as it take i
to hail a cab

they be going to pin dallas on you
agent mulder
but there be nothing
you could have do
nothing anyone
could have do to prevent that bomb
from going off
because the truth be
something you would never have guess
never have predict

and what be that




darius Michaud never tried or
intended to defuse the bomb

he just let it explode

what be the question nobody asking
why that build
why not the federal
build

the federal build be too well
guard

no
they put the bomb in the build
across the street because it have
federal office
the federal emergency
management agency have a provisional
medical quarantine office there
which
be where the body be find
but
that be the thing

the thing you do not know
that
you would never think to check

those people be already dead

before the bomb go off

that be what i be saying

Michaud be a twentytwo year veteran
of the bureau

Michaud be a patriot
the man he be
loyal to know they way around dallas
they blow that build to hide
something
maybe something even they
could not predict

you be saying they destroyed an entire
building to hide the body of three
fireman

and one little boy

i think you be full of shit

do you



i wake you

no

why not
it be three

be you drink mulder

i be until about an hour ago

be that before or after you get the
idea to come here

what be you imply scully

i think you may have get drink
and decided to come here to talk i
out of quit

be that what you would like i to do

go home mulder
it be late

get dressed scully

mulder what be you do

just get dressed
i will explain on the
way




you have get something to show i


yes



we bring the atmosphere back down to
freezing in order to control the
development which be nothing like
we have ever see

bring on by what


heat i think
the coincident invasion
of a host the fireman and an
environment that raised he basic body
temperature above ninety eight point
six

this mane still alive


technically and biologically though
he will never recover

how can this be


the develop organism be use his
life energy digest bone and
tissue
we have just slow the
process


do you want i to destroy this one
too
before it gestates

no
no
we need to try we vaccine on
it


and if it be unsuccessful

incinerate it
like the other


this mane family will want to see the
body laid to rest

tell they he be trying to save the
young boyo life and that he die
heroically like the other fireman


of what

they seem to buy we story about the
Hanta virus
you will make sure the
family be taken care of
financially along with a sizeable
donation to the community
maybe a small roadside memorial


and floor you be visiting

we be going to the morgue

that area be currently off limit to
anyone other than authorized medical
personnel

on whose order

general McAddies

general McAddie be who request we
coming here
we be awaken at three
and told to get down here
immediately

i do not know anything about that

well call general McAddie

i do not have he number

they can patch you in through the
switchboard

hey
we do not have time to dick around
here watch you demonstrate you
ignorance in the chain of command
the
order come direct from general
McAddie
call he
we will conduct we
business while you confirm
authorization

why do not you go on ahead head and

dallas

accord to this tag

and you be looking for

proximal exposure to source and fly
debris

breakdown

you be telling i the because of death
on the report be false
that this man
do not die from an explosion or from
fly debris

i do not know what killed this man
i be
not sure if anybody else could claim
to either


you know this man do not die at the
bomb site before we get here

i would be tell as much

you be saying the bomb be a
coverup
of what

i do not know

you be going to find here be not
anything that can be categorize or
easily referenced

mulder this be going to take some
time and somebody going to figure
out soon enough we be not even
suppose to be here

ethics

government

i do not either but it sure sell
book

i be right about dallas
be not i
agent mulder

how

i picked up the historical document of
the venality and hypocrisy of the
american government
the daily
newspaper

you said the fireman and the boy be
find in the temporary office of the
federal emergency management agency
why

accord to the newspaper have
be called out to manage an outbreak
of the Hanta virus
be you familiar
with the Hanta virus agent mulder

it be a deadly virus spread by field
mouse in the southwest you

several
year ago

and be you familiar with
what
the federal emergency management
Agencys real power be
allow
the white house to suspend
constitutional government upon
declaration of a national emergency
to create a nonelected government
think about that
what be an agency with such broad
sweep power doing managing a small
viral outbreak in suburban texas

be you saying it be not such a small
outbreak

i be saying it be not the Hanta virus

what be it

when we be young man in the
military you father and i be
recruited for a project
they told we
it be biological warfare
virus
there be rumor about it origin

what killed those man

what killed they i will not even write
about
i tell you they would do more than
just harass i
they have the future
to protect

i will know soon enough

what killed those man can not be
identified in simple medical term
i
god we can not even wrap we mind
around something as obvious as
we have no context for what killed
those man or any appreciation of the
scale in which it will be unleash in
the future
of how it will be
transmitted
of the environmental
factor involved

plague

the plague to end all plague agent
mulder
silent weapon for a quiet
war
the systematic release of an
indiscriminate organism for which the
man who will bring it on still have no
cure
they have be working on this for
fifty year
while the rest of the
world be fighting gooks and commie
these man have be secretly
negotiating a plan armageddon

negotiating with whom

i think you know
the timetable have
be set
it will happen on a holiday
when people be away from they home
when we elected official be at
they resort or out of the country
the president will declare a state of
emergency at which time all federal
agency all government will come
under the power of the federal
emergency management agency

agent mulder
the secret government

and they tell i i be paranoid

something go wrong something
unanticipated
go back to dallas and
dig
or you be only going to find out
like the rest of the country agent
mulder
when it be too late

how can i reach you

you can not

no calling hawaii

that meet away

mulder i can not i be already way
past the point of common sense here



scully
hello


you be looking for what amount to a
needle in a haystack
i be afraid the
explosion be so devastate there
have not be a whole lot we have be
able to put together just yet

i be looking for anything out of the
ordinary
maybe something from the
office where the body be
find

we be not expect to find those
remain of course
they go right
off to washington

be there anything in those office
that do not go to


some bone fragment come up in the
sift this morning
we think there would
be another fatality but we find
out have recovered they from an
archeological site out of town

have you examine they

no
just fossil far as i know

i would like this person to take a look
if you do not mind

let i just see if i can lay i hand
on what you be looking for

you said you be not coming

i be not planning on it
particularly
after spending a half hour in cold
storage this morning
but i get a
well look at the blood and tissue
sample i take from the fireman

what do you find

something i could not show to anyone
else
not without more information
and not without cause the kind of
attention i would just as soon avoid right
now
the virus those man be infected with
contain a protein coat i have never
see before
what it do to they it
do extremely fast
and unlike the
virus or any other aggressive
strain it survive very nicely
outside the body

how be it contracted

that i do not know
but if it be through
simple contact of blood to blood and
if it do not respond to conventional
treatment it could be a serious
health threat

like i said these be fossil and
they be not near the blast center so
they be not going to tell you much

may i

you said you know the location of the
archeological site where these be
find

show you right on a map




i need to have those setting check
and reset
i need a steady minus two
celsius through the transfer of the
body after i administer the vaccine



it be go

it be what


it be left the body
i think it be
gestated


wait i see it

while we have be make to wait we have
watch surveillance tape which have
raised more concern

more concern than that

we have be forced to reassess we role
in colonization by new fact of
biology which have presented
themselves

the virus have mutate

on it own

it effect on the host have changed
the virus no longer just invade the
brain as a control organism
it be
developed a way to modify the host
body

into what

new extraterrestrial biological
entity

i god

the geometry of mass infection
present certain conceptual
reevaluations for we
about we place
in they colonization

this be not colonization it be
spontaneous repopulation
all we
work
if it be true then they have
be use we all along
we have be
laboring under a lie

it could be an isolate case

how can we know

we be going to tell they what we have
find
what we have learned
turn over a
body infected with the gestating
organism

in hope of what
learning that it be
true
that we be nothing more than
digestive for the creation of a new
race of alien lifeform

let i remind you who be the new race
and who be the old
what could be gain by withhold
anything from they
by pretend to
ignorance
we knowledge may forestall
they plan to step up the timetable
to start colonization early

and if it do not
by cooperate now
we be but beggar to we demise
we
ignorance be in cooperate with the
colonist at all

cooperation be we only chance of
saving ourselves

they still need we to carry out they
preparation

we will continue to use they as they do
we
if only to play for more time to
continue work on we vaccine

we vaccine may have no effect

well without a cure for the virus
we be nothing more than digestive
anyway

i lateness may have well be
absence
course have already be
taken

there be complication

do they know

mulder be in dallas when we be
trying to dispose of evidence
he be
go back there again
someone have
tip he

who

Kurtzweil we think

we have allow this man he freedom
he book have actually helped we to
facilitate plausible denial
have he
outlive he usefulness to we

no one believe Kurtzweil or he
book
he be a toiler
crank

and mulder

we new situation make we vulnerable
if he learn information as we do he
could jeopardize the project
secrecy

control of information mean control
of mulder

i can control mulder
i have always
controlled mulder

this may take another approach

you can not kill mulder
he be get too
much light on he

you need not kill a man to destroy
he

personalize the
inference
no you need only take away what be
most precious to he


i do not know mulder

he do not mention a park

this be where he marked on the map
scully
where he say those fossil
be unearth

i do not see any evidence of an
archeological or any other kind of
digsite
not even a sewer or a storm
drain

you be sure the fossil you look at
show the same sign of deterioration
you see in the fireman body in the
morgue

the bone be porous as if the virus
of the causative microbe be
digest it

and you have never see anything like
that

no
it do not show up on any of the
immunohistochemical test

this look like new grass to you

it look pretty green for this
climate

ground dry about an inch down
somebody just laid this down
very
recently i would say

all the equipment be brand new

no irrigation system
Somebodys
covering they track

hey

do you live around here

yeah

you see anybody digging here

not suppose to talk about it

you be not suppose to talk about it
who told you that

nobody

nobody
same nobody who put this park
in
that new equipment
they buy you these bike

i think you well tell we

we do not even know you

well we be agent

you be not agent

how do you know

because agent wear like suit and
goofy tie
and dress like i mom
wear to church
like on that one
show

maybe you have be watch too much


they all left twenty minute ago

go that way


unmarked tanker truck
what be
archaeologist haul out in tanker
truck

i do not know mulder

and where be they going with it

that be the first question to answer
if we be going to find they


what be i choice

about a hundred mile of nothing in
each direction

where would they be going

we have get two choice
one of they be
wrong

you think they go leave

i do not know why i think they go
right

five year together how many time
have i be wrong


hey i be right about the bomb
be not i

this be great
this be fit

what

i have get to be in washington

in
eleven hour for a hear the
outcome of which might possibly affect
one of the big decision of i
life
and here i be standing out in
the middle of nowhere texas chasing
phantom tanker truck

we be not chasing truck we be
chasing evidence

of what exactly

that bomb in dallas be allow to go
off to hide something
body
infected with a virus you detect
yourself

they haul gas in tanker truck they
haul oil in tanker truck they
do not haul virus in tanker truck

yeah well they may this one

what do you mean by haul
what be you not telling i here

this virus it

mulder

it may be extraterrestrial

i do not believe this
i do not fucking
believe this
reaching she limit of
impatience
know i have be here
i have be
here one too many time with you
mulder

be where

pound down some dirt road in the
middle of the night
chase some
elusive truth on a dim hope only to
find myself standing right where i be
right now
at another dead end


what do you think it be

i have no idea


this be weird mulder

very weird

any thought on why anybody be
grow corn in the middle of the
desert

not unless those be giant jiffy pop
container out there



cool in here
temperature being
regulated

for the purpose of what

i think we be on top of something
i
think these be some kind of venting

you hear that

i hear the hum
like electricity
high voltage maybe

maybe
maybe not

what do you think those be for


scully

that the bomb in dallas may have
be to destroy the body of those

reason for they would not have to be
explain

those be very serious allegation
agent scully

this
something to tie this claim of
yours to the crime

nothing completely conclusive

i hope to
we be working to develop

dr
Kurtzweil be not it
dr
alvin
Kurtzweil

jesus christ

you be surprise
certainly you have
be expect some response to you
indiscretion

i be quite sure whatever you told agent
mulder you have you good reason
it be a weakness in man we age
the
urge to confess
i forgive you that

what be you do here
what do you
want from i

you must try to understand what i be
here to do be only to protect i
child
you and i have but short
live left
i can only hope the same
be not true for they


mr
mulder

what happen to Kurtzweil

he be come and go

where be scully

i have answer for you

be she alive

yes

i be quite prepared to tell you
everything though there be not much
you have not guess

about the conspiracy

i think of it as an agreement
word
you father liked to use

i want to know where scully be

the location of agent scully
and the
mean to save she life
please


what be it

weak vaccine against the virus agent
scully have be infected with
it must
be administered with ninety six
hour

you be lying

no
though i have no way to prove
otherwise
the virus be
extraterrestrial
we know very little
about it except that it be the
original inhabitant of this planet

virus

simple unstoppable lifeform
what
be a virus but a colonizing force that
cannot be defeated
living in a cave
underground until it mutate
and
attack

this be what you have be conspire to
conceal
disease

no
for god sake you have get it all
backwards

aid the ebola virus on the
evolutionary scale they be newborn
this virus walk the planet long
before the dinosaur

what do you mean walk

you alien agent mulder you little
green man first landed here millions
of year ago
those that do not leave
have be laying dormant underground
since the last ice age
in the form of
an evolve pathogen
wait to be
reconstitute when the alien race from
which it come return to colonize the
planet
use we as host
against
this we have no defense
nothing but a
weak vaccine
do you see why it be keep secret
why
even the good man man like you
father could not let the truth be
known

until dallas we believe the virus
be simply a control organism
that mass infection would make we a
slave race

that be why you bombed the build
the infect fireman the boy

imagine we surprise when they begin
to gestate
i group have be working
cooperatively with the alien
colonist facilitating they
program
to give we access to the
virus
in false hope we might be able
to secretly find a cure
so that we
might save ourselves as the last of
the species
you father wisely refused to believe
this choosing hope over selfishness
hope be the only future he have
he
child
the only future any of we have

but
he sacrifice he own daughter
i sister samantha

the only true survivor of the viral
holocaust will be those immune to it
those vaccinate against it and
humanalien hybrid
you father
arranged for you sister abduction
he allowed she to be taken to an alien
hybrid program so that she would
survive
as a clone
he have different hope for you
that
you would uncover the truth about the
project
that you would stop it
that
you would fight the future

why be you telling i this

i think it only fair you should
know given how hard you have work

what happen to Kurtzweil

as you father know thing need to be
sacrifice to the future

where be he

dr
Kurtzweil be in the trunk

let i out
stop the car

driver

the man i work with will stop at
nothing to clear the way for what they
believe be they stake in the
inevitable future
i be ordered to
kill Kurtzweil
necessary action to
protect i grandchildren live
i might just as easily kill you

trust no one mr
mulder

you have precious little time
what
i have given you the alien colonist
have no idea exist
you hold in you
hand the power to end the project

how

the vaccine you hold be the only
defense against the virus
it
introduction into an alien environment
may have the power to destroy the
delicate plan we have so assiduously
protected for the last fifty year
or it may not

what alien environment

find agent scully
save she
only she
science can save the future

what about you

i life be over
go

go now









mon
it be all going to hell


scully

breathe can you breathe

what

cold

hang on
i be going to get you out of
here





we have get to keep moving

where be we

you get i
but i think i know what
they do with jimmy hoffa

i can not

i can not go any farther

yes you can
you be going to make it
scully

shit

scully

you be not dying on i now godammit
godammit godammit

mulder

have you big time

keep breathing scully

scully you breathing



we have get to run








mulder



in light of the report i have get
before i
in light of the narrative
i be now hearing

i official report be incomplete
pending these new fact i be be
ask to reconcile
agent scully

while there be direct evidence now
that a federal agent may have be
involved in the bomb
the other
event you have laid down here seem too
incredible on they own and quite
frankly implausible in they
connection

what be it you find incredible

well
where would you like i to
start
antarctica be a long way from
dallas agent scully
i can not very
well submit a report to the attorney
general that allege the link you have
make here
bee and corn crop do not
quite fall under the rubric of
domestic terrorism

no they do not

most of what i find in here be lacking
a coherent picture of an organization
with an attributable motive
i realize
you be very lucky to be alive agent
scully
the ordeal you have endure have
clearly affected you though the
hole in you account leave this panel
with little choice but to delete these
reference from we final report to
the justice department
until which
time hard evidence become available
that would give we because to pursue
such an investigation

i do not believe the currently have
an investigation unit qualified to
pursue the evidence in hand



mr
skinner

please ask agent scully to come back
to this hear
we be not quite
finished


congratulations on you survival
you
life be worthless now i hope you know
that

and yours

you think you have stopped it
what i have
work for fifty year to create
you
have not stopped it
you can not stop
it
you be just one man

you be wrong
