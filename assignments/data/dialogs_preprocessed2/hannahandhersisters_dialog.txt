i life

you be going to believe in jesus christ

i know it sound funny but i be
going to try

pushing back some
sheet music that be

beautiful that when man see she
walking along the street they would
drive they car right up on the
sidewalk

slight exaggeration

i know

but only slight

you have be very cold to i tonight

glance back at
elliot then turning away
no

be something wrong

oh not here
there be too many people around


hey hannah
you know i think lee
be really serious about she new
boyfriend
yeah eh from what i
understand he sound really nice

i be so happy for she
i think
she be in love

hey what be the matter

taking a bunch of
celery out and
slamming the
refrigerator door
i be real upset about what you write

i script

it be obviously base on elliot and
i

oh so loosely

no not oh so loosely
real
specifically
be that how you see
we

shrug walk
out of the pantry area
well

can i can i not accept gesture
and feeling from people
do i do
i put people off

well it be a madeup story

no it be real exact
Thethe
situation the dialogue everything
it isit be full of intimate detail
between elliot and i
which i do not i do not see how you
could even possibly know about

conversation we once have about
adoption

gesture the towel
still in she hand as
she speak to she
offscreen sister
well lee mention that to i so
obviously you discuss it with she
you
i just take the essence and i blow
it up into drama

i do not see how lee could know
about these thing
i do not
i
do not tell she everything

wow i guess i hit a nerve

you make it sound like you know i
have no need or something
you
think i be too selfsufficient

stopping she mindless
straighten at the
table react
now hannah that be not what i
mean you know
walking offscreen to
the sink area
uh yeah everybody rely on you
for so much
you be so giving
it be not a criticism
we love you
we be grateful


walking out of the
pantry to the food
laden table
you be grateful but you resent i

oh wow
i do not want to have this
conversation
i do not do anything
wrong

Yyou mention to i yourself that
you and elliot be have some
problem

yeah we be have some problem
but problem that be i
business
which i do not see how
you could know about in such detail
how do lee know about these
thing
how
they be private

turning to look at
she sister as she
walk past
well why do not you share they with
we

i do not
i do not want to bother
everyone

that be the point
i would like to be
bothered

i do not see how you could know
about these thing unless elliots
be talking to you

no he have not
if i offended you
i be sorry

it be over elliot
i do not know
how to make it any clear
