jimmy i said do not you go in you

spy galvin she
tone change
sir you be not allow to be in
here

you can not be in here

as if remembering
something simply
i be she attorney

it be a question of continue value
st
catherines to do the good
that she must do in the community
have to maintain the position that
she hold in the community
so we
have a question of balance
on the
one hand the reputation and so
the effectiveness of we hospital
and two of she important doctor
and on the other hand the right
of you client

young woman
in she prime
deprive of
life
sight
she family
it be tragic
it be a tragic accident

nothing of course can begin to
make it right
but we must do what
we can
we must do all that we can

yes
we must try to make it right

it be a generous offer mr
galvin
nothing can make the woman well
but we try to compensate
to make
a gesture

how do you settle on the amount

we think it be just

you think it be just

yes

because it strike i how neatly
three go into the amount
two
hundred ten thousand
that would
mean i keep seventy

that be we insurance company
recommendation

yes
it would be

nothing that we can do can make that
woman well

and no one will know the truth

what be the truth

that that poor girl put she trust in
the hand of two man who take she
life she be in a coma she life be
go
she have no family she have no
home she be tied to a machine she
have no friend and the people who
should care for she
she doctor

minute in itself constitute bad

minute lapse in restoring the
heartbeat in and of itself be
negligence

she brain damage could have be
cause by she be deprived of oxygen
for two minute

page
contraindication to general
anesthetic
ideally a patient should
refrain from taking nourishment up
to nine hour prior to induction of
general anesthetic
do that sound
familiar


yes
i write it

practice and methodology in
anaesthesia
general textbook on
the subject
be that correct


i
yes
it be

and you write that


yes

if a patient have taken
nourishment within one hour prior to
inducement general anesthetic should
be avoid at all cost because of
the grave risk the patient will
aspirate food particle into he
mask
be that what happen to
deborah ann kaye
she aspirate into
she mask


she threw up in she mask yes
but
she have not eat one hour prior to
admission

if she have eat say one hour prior
to admission the inducement of a
general anesthetic
the type you
give she
would have be
negligent


negligent
yes
it would have be
criminal
but that be not the case

mr
Concannon

mr
Concannon

thank you you honor
we object to
the copy of the admission form as
incompetent and essentially hearsay
evidence and cite mcgee versus state
of indiana you

point and
through of the uniform code
the
admission of a duplicate document in
preference to an exist original
must presuppose the possibility of
alteration and so must be disallow

and you honor have given the
plaintiff the leeway we would like
you ruling on this issue now
we
object to the admission of the xerox
form

one moment mr
Concannon

the document be disallow the jury
will be advise not to consider the
testimony of kathy costello regard
the xerox form
it be unsubstantiated and we can not
accept a copy in preference to the
original

thank you you honor
further/far
ms
costello be a rebuttal witness
as a
surprise witness she may only serve
to rebut direct testimony
as she
only evidentiary rebuttal be the
admitting form which have be
disallow i request that she entire
testimony be disallow and the jury
advise that they must totally
disregard she appearance here

i be going to uphold that

i object you honor

overrule

exception

note
thank you
miss costello be a rebuttal witness
she sole rebuttal be the document
which have be disallow



she entire testimony must be stricken
from the record
you should not have
hear it but you do
now that be
i mistake
and you must strike it
from you mind give it no weight

legally it be over
Concannon be
brilliant

tell i about Kaitlin costello

there be nothing to tell
it be be
stricken from the record

i know
do you believe she

mr
galvin

you know so much of the time we be
lost
we say please god tell we
what be right
tell we what be true
there be no justice
the rich win
the poor be powerless
we become
tire of hearing people lie
after a
time we become dead
little dead
we start think of ourselves as
victim
and we become victim
and we become weak
and doubt
ourselves and doubt we
institution
and doubt we
belief
we say for example the
law be a sham
there be no law
i be a fool for have believe
there be

but today you be the law
you be
the law
and not some book and not
the lawyer or the marble statue
and the trapping of the court
all that they be be symbol
of we desire to be just
all that they be in effect be a
prayer
a fervent and a frighten prayer

in i religion we say act as if
you have faith and faith will be
given to you

if
if we would have faith in
justice we must only believe in
ourselves
and act with justice
and i believe that there be justice
in we heart
thank you

have you reach a verdict



we have you honor

you honor we have agreed to hold
for the plaintiff
but on the size
of the award be we bound

you be not bound by anything other
than you good judgment base on
the evidence



be we permitted to award an amount
great than the amount the plaintiff
ask for

yes
you be

please retire and

the jury might be out for awhile
beat
tentatively
you want to run across the street
and get a drink
