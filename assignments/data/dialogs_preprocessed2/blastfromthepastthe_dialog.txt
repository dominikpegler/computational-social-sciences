some kind of special
synthetic rubber
and some kind of
automate machine
anyhow suddenly
he get rich
i mean rich
and quits
teach

how be that

just what the doctor ordered

with all he money they could have
moved to beverly hills but they
decided to stay in the valley
calvin
spend all he time tinkering out
there in he workshop
if you ask i
it be all very strange

he dig a huge hole out there for a
swim pool
then he decided he
do not want it and filled the thing
in
and what be that big high fence
for

there currently exist a type of neon
light that last five year
but you
will not see it on the market
same be
true of battery
i could take you
simple yacht battery and rig it to
last a decade easily

well what the heck kind of a
markete system can not get great new
product like that out to the public

veeeery good one harold
free
market capitalism may not be a perfect
order but it be the good we have get or

i would say i baseball card collection be
as complete as any one i have ever see

calvin
hey calvin
kennedys going toetotoe with
khrushchev on the television

this sudden clandestine decision
to station strategic weapon for the
first time outside of soviet soil be
a deliberately provocative and
unjustified change in the status quo
which cannot be accepted by this
country

wolf one say intention

i have get secondary of an engine fire
and i will need to find a clear area to
eject

roger wolf one
can you make it to
the ocean

we will not prematurely or
unnecessarily risk the cost of
worldwide nuclear war in which even
the fruit of victory would be ash
in we mouth
but neither will we
shrink from the risk at any time it
must be face

i be sorry everyone but given this
extraordinary turn of event i think
it be prudent that we cut the evening
short
i be sure this cuban thing will
resolve itself but in the
meantime
i would suggest taking a
prayerful watchandwait stance

we will do this again
maybe next week
here you hat
could i wrap
something up for you
do you have a
coat

Whatd i tell you

you do back here

oh i be just examining this rear
hatchway

why

no reason
well it be pretty clear that the front
entrance cave in when the bomb go
off
so you know when the time be
up we will have to return to the
surface use you know this back
entrance
which be very nice because
it have the service elevator

very nice
unless it cave in too

man who collect baseball card

uh yes you do

or pee in they pants when they see
the ocean

yes you do

or have perfect table manner

you know i ask he about that
and
he said that good manner be a way we
have of showing other people that we
respect they
see you would eat like a
slob if you
be alone but since another human
being be present you show that person
respect by going to the trouble of
have proper manner
i do not know
that
i think it be a way of
appear superior
know what else he told i

what

he think that i be a gentleman and
that you be a lady

well consider the source
i do not
even know what a lady be

exactly
i think a gentleman be
somebody who owned horse
turn out
the short and very simple definition
of a gentleman or a lady be
someone
who always attempt to make the people
around he or she feel as comfortable
as possible
that be it
if you do not
do that nothing else matter
the
car the clothes the house

where do he get all that information

from the od place
he parent
told he
i do not think i get that
memo

so now i suppose he be trying to make
those two dancer feel as comfortable
as possible

he do not leave with they

well
i admit it
i be glad to hear
that

he left with sophie

whispering little french thing into
he ear
