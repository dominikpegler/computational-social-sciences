okay
if it be a good trip i will give you a
little extra

do not worry
i take you close
but not too
close
you do not want they to eat you

ready amigos

what be that

ben

unclip you line








oh actually charlie those two be
herbivore
they would not be interest in
fighting each other
but these
see these be carnivore
and this one here
see it claw this one here use it
claw to gouge at the throat of it opponent

uh alan

hmm

he be three
why do not you wait till he be a
little old

oh right
happy dinosaur

that must be mark
mark be back here
coming through the gate carrying a briefcase
he be they age handsome but not annoyingly so with a friendly

good day

keeping the world safe
re
baby
here let i take she

mark this be alan grant

nice to meet you alan
i have hear a lot about
you

daddy this be a herbabore


the bird with a cookie holding a it just out of reach

what be i name
come on jack say it
be i
name alan
say i name
the bird do not respond

he used to know i

sorry alan it be be six year

more coffee

yes
great

so marks working at the state department
now

really
what do you do there

i could tell you about it but than i would have to
kill you

indeed



anything good

raptor mostly

i favorite

you remember the sound they make

i try not to

we have do cranial scan and raptor
actually have a quite sophisticated
resonating chamber
i have a theory that
they ability to vocalize be the key to they
social intelligence
the way they can work
together as a team

you think they could talk to each other

to a degree we never imagined

bullshit

you taught he that



good luck with the fund raise

it be never easy but before jurassic park
you could find money
somewhere
now fossil
be out
everyone want to see a real live
dinosaur

time change alan
but you be the still the
best
i mean that

the last of i breed

i would well get going

let i know if i can help alan
you be bad
about asking for help but please ask i
anything anytime

deep down knowing he never
will
okay
goodbye ellie

goodbye alan

when i meet you i think that one day
millions of year ago all the dinosaur
become extinct
wipe out
but you told i
otherwise
when condition changed
dinosaur changed
they become other thing
they evolved

wellaccepted theory

alan do not be afraid to evolve



it be through the painstaking study of the
interior chamber in multiple specimen that
we can determine this exciting correlation
between the larynx and the upper plate
that
let we we theorize theorize mind you that
the raptor might have be capable of bird
like vocalization
which as you can
imagine would be a tremendous breakthrough

thank you very much dr
grant
now do
anyone have a question

do anyone have a question that do not
relate to jurassic park

or the incident in san diego which i will
remind you i do not witness

you theory on raptor be good and all but
be not all this conjecture kind of moot

i mean once the you

and costa rica and
everyone decide how to handle the second
island scientist will just go in and look
for themselves

be not paleontology itself in danger of
extinction

no and let i be perfectly clear on this
point
dinosaur live million year ago
what be leave of they be fossilize in stone
the actual scientist spend year to
undercover

what john hammond and ingen created be
theme park monster
nothing more nothing
less
the class clearly disagree with he assessment

you be saying you would not want to study
they if you have the chance

no force on this earth or in heaven could get i on
that island







Udesky
yes sir
we be good to go
i will lock it down as
soon as you drop i the payment



that be right two of the very good i could
find
no i have not work with they
personally but they come with the high
recommendation

you have get nothing to worry about sir
this
be going to be a piece of cake




billy
i do not think i be do this right

you need to go slowly
see just take it little
at a time

i can never tell what be bone and what be rock

technically it be all rock
the calcium in the
bone be replace during fossilization
but
you can feel the difference
see
rough
smooth
rough smooth

rough

smooth

dr
grant

mr
brennan




how be you trip
profitable

we will be broke in four week

three week
i have to rent some equipment

you rent an automate litter box

it be a rapid prototyper
i feed in the scan
data from the raptor skull than the computer
break it into thousands of slice which this
thing print one layer on top of the other
it be the future of paleontology

not if it can not dig

i give you a raptores resonate chamber

oh i forget to tell you
some visitor
wanted to come by and talkto you
i
told they you would be happy to see they
maybe even have dinner with they

absolutely not

they be here

what
who be walking up to they
put on a friendly smile billy go up to they

dr
grant

paul kirby
kirby enterprise
i card
as friendly be hard to read
there seem to be

what can i do for you mr
kirby

well sir i be a great admirer
of yours and i have an extremely interesting
proposition to discuss
would you let i wife
and i take you to have dinner tonight
we treat

you know i have be travel and i be very
tire
maybe some other time

i guarantee it will be worth you while

amanda and i have admire you work for
year

inspiring

thank you

galapagos

we even have two seat reserved aboard the
first commercial moon flight

hmmm

now for we wedding anniversary this year
we wanted to do something really special
something

onceinalifetime

we have arranged for a private airplane to
take we flying over isla Sorna
and we want
you to be we guide

kirby but i be
afraid i be much to busy

refer you to a number of highly qualify

no no see dr
grant you be the good
you have
see these animal in the flesh
no one else
have come close to you

i be flattered but i have taken this little
adventure tour
and with the air
restriction they have imposed after the
incident in san diego you can not fly low
enough to see anything of interest

you see that be just the thing
paul and i
have special permission to fly low

how low

well i be no aviation specialist
but i do
know it be hell of a lot low than anyone
else

from what i understand it be pretty much
whatever we want

that be hard to believe

let we just say that through i business
importsexports emerging market i have
make some friend in high place
in this
case the costa rican government

dr
grant you do not know how important it be
for we to have you come along
it would make
all the difference

and of course we be prepare to make a
sizeable contribution to you research here

i can write all kind of number on this
check
just tell i what exactly it would
take






even with what i pay you you could get a
good bag

no way

these cliff in new zealand
Updraft send i
right into the side

we be sorry
all circuit be busy

shit

what be it
what be the matter
pilot


the plane break free of the tree limb and tailfirst to







over here

this way





do not worry
it be dead

nobody move a muscle



come on



why do you bring we here

we son be on this island
we need you help
to find he

this be he
eric
Hes thirteen now
he be
just about the great kid in the world

he be with a man named ben hildebrand

who be that

she new boyfriend

friend
we be vacation
eric wanted
to see the island and the dinosaur so ben
find a guy who would take they parasailing
they never come back

we called everyone do everything we could
because of all the controversy over this
island no one will step in
costa rica say
it be a nofly zone it be they own damn fault
guy at the you
embassy we you

embassy
said we should accept the inevitable
you
believe that

so you hired these mercenary

we prefer recovery specialist
we do
overseas custody issue and

then you dupe we into coming here

we needed somebody who know the lay of the
land
somebody who be to this island before

i have never be on this island

sure you have
you write that book

that be isla Nublar
this be isla Sorna
the second island

i do not know there be two island

still you have survive the dinosaur before
you
saved those kid

few of we survive
lot more die
and we
be well prepare and well arm
how many day have they be missing

eight week

after what you have see today you really
think you son could be alive

he be smart dr
grant
and he know so much
about dinosaur

no i be sorry but no
we will savage what we
can from the plane
then we head for the
coast
there may be a boat left something to
get we off this island

dr
grant we be not leaving without we son

you can stick with we or you can go and look for
he
either way you be probably not get
out of here alive

what do we do

well i think we should start searching for you
son
in the direction they be going

excellent



sorry

nothing you have not see before

how much weight have you lost

twenty twentyfire pound
i have be
swimming at the

you hate to swim

people change

you look good

so do you

how would you classify it

obviously a superpredator
Suchimimus
that snout

they never get that big

Baryonyx

not with that sail
Spinosaurus Aegypticus

i do not remember that on InGens list

that be because it be not on they list
who
know what else they be up to

so mr
kirby tell i when you climb
do you base camp at or foot

Thirtythousand i think
closer to the top

about a thousand foot above it actually
most mountainclimbers remember how tall
that mountain be

there be no kirby enterprise be there

there be
i own a place called kirby paint
and title plus
we be out in the westgate
shopping center in enid oklahoma
the
plus be for bathroom fixture fireplace
accessory patio furniture
stuff like
that

i do not suppose that check you write we be
any good

he paid we half up front
cash

mortgaged everything we have to do it
even
the store
and if we make it off this island
with i son i swear i will make good on the
money i owe you
i do not care if it take i
the rest of i life

however long that be



eric

quiet

stop that
dr
grant say this be dangerous
territory

well we should split up or something
we can
cover twice the area

no dr
grant say

dr
grant say this dr
grant say that

well what be the use of hiring an expert if
you not going to listen to he

because dr
grant be not looking for eric
dr
grant be looking for the coast

fine
and when the Tricyclatops come after
you do not come crying to i

oh do not worry about that

what

nothing

what do you say

nothing

what do you say

just drop it paul

if they split up i be going with you



young adult

eric


hey

that be eric

dr
grant

raptor
and as he say the word off in the distance we hear




what be a raptor

they do not look that big
i mean
comparatively

if we come across one we might live

well that be good

but you never come across just one

wait
where be billy
grant
billy
billy

i think we be not suppose to yell


here

i get some great picture of the nest
you
know this prove raptor raised they young
in colony

this speak to a large social structure the
possibility of darwinian altruism
it
change everything

we could cowrite a paper

ah yes the first rule of academic
publish
or perish




i bet there be a very good chance Erics in
there
i would bet i bottom dollar


world



eric
be you here

eric

what the hell



let we see
i have get about a dollar seventy
five
how about you guy

thank god for preservative

Udesky

he be this way

it be not safe

we have to help he

he be right
predator would not leave a kill
wound

he be not a kill he be still alive

they could not climb up so they be trying
to get we to come down

they set a trap
they actually set a trap

where be grant



what do that mean
what be you saying

god damn you billy

it mean give we the egg do not it
we
want the egg


come on
they will be back







eric

eric you parent be both here

in costa rica

on the island

they will never make it
i mean they can not
manage when the cable go out

you would be surprise what people can do when
they have too

you be alan grant be not you
i read both of you book

which one do you prefer

the first one
before you where on the island
you liked dinosaur back then

back then they have not tried to eat i

when ingen clear out they left a lot of
stuff behind

any weapon radio

find this but the battery dead

it be a wonder you be not
i be amaze eric
i
barely last hour
you last eight
week

be that all it be be
i think it be long

the important thing be we both make it
that be something we have in common

do you read malcolms book

yeah

what do you think

i dunno
i mean it be kind of preachy
Chaosthis chaosthat
and like to i the
guy seem kind of high on himself

that be two thing we have in common



we can not just stop looking
eric and dr
grant be out there somewhere

i want to find they too but we can not do a bit
of good right now
for every scary thing we
see in the daylight i will bet there ten time
more of they at night
be i right

i do not know

i think you be an expert

dr
grant be

well dr
grant be not here so we be going to
have to figure out what to do ourselves

so what do we do





i just want you know amanda
it be not
you fault what happen

eric have always be headstrong and you
throw ben hildebrand into the mix and well

well what

well damn it
i do not speak i will of the dead
what i be trying to say be it be just a crazy
accident
the exact same thing could have
happen if he be with i
you can not go
beating yourself up about it

this would not happen if he be with
you
i mean you drive five mile below the
speed limit
i totaled three car in fives
year

that one time be just the bumper

he would have be safe
completely
entirely suffocatingly safe
i would have he to see more of the world than
enid oklahoma
i wanted to see more of the
world than enid oklahoma
and so yes it be
i fault that this happen
i be sorry that
you have to be here

i be not sorry at all

i

know what this be

raptor claw
i use to have one
fossil

mine new

how much of this island have you explored

i stay pretty close to the compound
figure if anyone come to look for i that be
where they would start

we need to head for the coast

be you sure

why

closer you get to the water the big
thing get



we need to stick to the plan
head for the
coast

what about eric and dr
grant

go to the coast be alans idea
if he be
alive that be where he be headed

what about eric

he be probably have a good chance by the coast
as it be
figure that all the big dinosaur
would live in the center of the island
right

sure





i phone

you have the phone the whole time

where be it

i do not know
i do not have it with i

when do you have it last

i do not remember

think

the plane
i get a call on the plane put it in
i coat pocket and

what


i loan it to nash
he must have have it on
he when he



mon
dad

sweetheart you be okay
you be okay
you be okay

never have a doubt
never do
us kirby man
we stick around huh

we do

honey there be not enough spit in the world
for that

we need to keep moving

alan i want to tell you that i be so sorry
about the

billy i can not talk to you now

please okay
just yell at i
call i an
idiot
an asshole
stupid
tell i i screw
up because i know i do

i think if we could get a raptor back
to the mainland we could get serious money
for it
enough to fund the dig for
year
more
whatever it take

you have to believe i
i do it with the
good intention

some of the bad thing imaginable have
be do with the good intention
you
rush in with no thought to the
consequence to yourself or anyone else
you be no good than the people who build
this place





we climb down to the barge and follow the
river out to the ocean
with any luck the
costa rican coast guard will pick we up

then we go home

then we go home



you okay

how about if we try this way

do you think it go all the way across

one way to find out

we would well do this one at a time

dr
grant



come on over
one at a time

eric it okay
you will be right behind i

we be not going anywhere i promise
amanda
we be all together now eric



okay
come on eric



how about if i

no i can do it

that be it eric
nice and easy



mom



oh i god

what be it

bird cage



eric

it will not hold



paul
where be he
can you see he

i be trying
that thing take he down this
way

split up








i



i









hang on eric









let go














he make it

billy look out

get back
get back

billy

it be no use dr
grant
no use







i own kid be right in front of i and i
do not do a damn thing

you could not have make that jump

i should have tried
it should have be i
on that beach back there not billy

how would you have helped eric
he need you paul
he need we

he could have die

but he do not
and neither do you
and i be
glad about that


do you have any kid

no
although i have studied they in the wild

i have a theory that there be two kind of
boy
those who want to be astronomer and
those who want to be astronaut

i want to be an astronaut

see i be the opposite
i never understood
why anyone would want to go into space
it be
so dangerous
you do one thing wrong and
you be dead
the astronomer or the
paleontologist get to study these amazing
thing from a place of complete safety
and
truthfully everything you really need to
learn you can learn it from the ground

but then you never get to go in space

exactly
the difference between imagine
how thing might be and seeing how they
really be
to be able to touch they
that be
what billy wanted to do

i can blame the people who make this island
but i can not blame the people who want to see
it
to study it

how be a boy suppose to resist this



keep quiet



find it before it stop ringing

i have get something
i think i have get
something

i have get it
i have get it

you too can own a time share in beautiful
guadalajara
enjoy a meal in one of we four
star restaurant explore we coral reef or
just walk on the beach

can not help but be a little offended



whatever you do do not call the you

embassy
they will not do a god damn thing

well we do not exactly have a costa rican
phone book here so it will have to be
somebody we know in the state
someone we
can absolutely count on to send help

stan

blizzard

then we should

let i tell you a few thing about you dad
okay
he be very very very clever very very brave
and he love you ever very much

he love you too

okay
he love we very very much
and i know
that right now more than anything you dad
would want to know that we be safe
okay

we be going to get out of this and
everything going to be all right i promise

listen to you mother

good thing i have be swimming huh





you remember when we go fish last
summer
and i be trying to put the boat in
and the trailer sink
and then the tow truck
come and tried to pull it out but it get
drag in
and the truck driver threatened
to knock you dad light out
so i said i
be the governor and he believe i

yeah

that be a fun day

we should try fish again

you mean it

i do
it be worth another shot
and who know
thing might turn out differently

the lady you called how do you know she can
help we

she be the one person i could always count on
and she be saved i more time than she
realize
i owe she everything

it be strike i now i never told she that

you should

you be right

eric do you know what happen to the boat
that bring you here
why do it crash

you have to go back
we can not leave he





they be not follow

we have to cut it
find something sharp





what do you think be going to happen with the
dinosaur

the population will stabilize eventually
they will adapt to fit different role

either that or the government will firebomb
it back to the stone age

i would completely support that

i hope they do not
i want to come back
someday

so do i


the helicopter fly away across the ocean leaving the island behind
