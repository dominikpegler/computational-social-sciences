still among the myriad microwave the
infrared message the gigabyte of one
and zeroe we find word infinitesimally
small bytesized now tiny even than
science lurking in some vague electricity
where if we listen we can hear the solitary
voice of that poet telling we
we be no other than a moving row
of magic shadowshapes that come and go
round with the Sunillumined lantern hold
in midnight by the master of the show

o
s

the moving finger write
and have writ
move on
nor all you piety nor wit
shall lure it back to cancel half a line
nor all you tear wash out a word of it


yesterday this day madness do prepare
tomorrow silence triumph or despair
drink
for you know not whence you come nor why
drink
for you know not why you go nor where

accord to the account of local
official at that time this gentleman
judge to be about forty year of age
appear suddenly in the village of wyle
near stonehenge in the west of england in
april of
use unfamiliar word and
speaking in a strange accent the man make
dire prognostication about a pestilence
which he predict would wipe out humanity
in approximately year
derange and
hysterical the man raped a young woman of the
village be taken into custody but then
mysteriously escaped and be not hear of again
cont

in mackay write during season
of great pestilence man have often
believe the prophecy of crazed
fanatic that the end of the world be
come
obviously this plaguedoomsday
scenario be considerably more compel
when reality support it in some form
whether it be the bubonic plague smallpox
or
in addition to these natural
contagions there be now technological
horror as well
besides radiation
consider we lurk fear of germ
warfare and it close approximation
chemical warfare which first rear
it ugly head in the deadly mustard
gas attack during the first world war
cont
o
s

during such an attack in the french
trench in october we have an
account of this soldier
can not
o
s

who during an assault be wounded
by shrapnel and hospitalize behind the
line where doctor discovered he have
lost all comprehension of french but
speak english fluently albeit in a
regional dialect they do not recognize
the man although physically unaffected
by the gas be hysterical
he claimed
he have come from the future that he be
looking for a pure germ that would
ultimately wipe mankind off the face of
the earth in the year

cont
o
s

although seriously injured the young
soldier disappeared from the hospital
before more data could be gathered
no
doubt he be trying to carry on his
mission to warn other substitute
for the agony of war
a selfinflicted
agony we call the cassandra complex
cont

cassandra in greek legend you will recall
be condemned to know the future but to be
disbelieve when she foretold it
hence
the agony of foreknowledge combined with
impotence to do anything about it


i think dr
Railly you have given
you alarmist a bad name
surely
there be very real and very convince
data that the planet cannot survive the
excess of the human race
proliferation
of atomic device uncontrolled breed
habit the rape of the environment the
pollution of land sea and air
in this
context be not it obvious that chicken
little represent the sane vision and
that homo sapiens motto let we go
shop
be the cry of the true lunatic

doctor Railly please
i wonder if
you be aware of i own study which
indicate that certain cycle of the
moon actually impact on the incidence
of apocalyptic prediction as observed
in urban emergency room and

you be great

you be leaving

the reservation at nine thirty

important

you sure you be going to be all right

under i foot whenever i stand for more
than a few second

o

race
not you or jeffrey or anybody
else
you have created something in you
mind james a substitute reality
in order to avoid something you do not
want to face

love to believe that

it can be deal with but only if you
want to
i can help you

dr
Railly
jim Halperin philly

sorry to call so early but

you find he
be he all right

au contraire doctor
no sign of you
good friend the kidnapper
however
the plot thicken
i have a ballistic
report on i desk that say the bullet
you claim you remove from mr
coles
thigh be an antique
and all indication
be it be fired
sometime prior to

so what i be think be maybe if i
send a detective down there to talk
with you you could maybe revise or
amplify on the circumstance
hello
hello
dr
Railly

no

the food the sky the certain uh
sexual temptation you have not
become addicted have you cole
to
that die world

no sir
i just want to do i part
to get we back on top
in charge of
the planet
and i have the experience
i know who the people be

he really be the most qualify

but all that
behavior

you said we be not real cole

well sir i do not think the human mind
be build to exist in two different
whatever you call it
dimension

it be stressful you said it yourselves
it get you confuse
you do not know
what be real and what be not

but you know what be real now

yes sir

he would have to bone up catch up to we
research the late clue

he be prove to be a quick study

you can not trick we you know
it
would not work

and why would you want to
it will be
dangerously close to the end

i understand
there would be no point

we be going to think about it cole
among ourselves
we will get back to you


you have reason to believe that i son
may be planning to do what

please i know it sound insane but


i be afraid this do not seem very
professional to i in fact it be
distressingly unprofessional for some
one who treated i son briefly if
indeed you actually be who you say you
be to take a sudden unsolicited interest
in he mental health six year later
and to telephone a parent to express
opinion that would be inappropriate
i do not know anything about monkey
army doctor
nothing whatsoever
if i son ever be involved in
it would be doubly inappropriate to
discuss matter of security with you
dr
Railly but if it will put you at
ease neither i son nor any other
unauthorized person have access to any
potentially dangerous organism in this
laboratory
thank you for you concern

o
s

dr
kathryn Railly


the psychiatrist who be kidnap by
that man who broke into i house
she
seem to have be suddenly strike by
the most preposterous notion about jeffrey

o
s

i attend a lecture once
apocalyptic
vision

cont

have she succumb to she own
theoretical
disease


given the nature of we work we can not ever
be careful enough
i think we should review
we security procedure perhaps upgrade they

let we consider again we current
information if the symptom be
first detect in philadelphia on june
that make we know that

it be released in philadelphia
probably on june

and it appear sequentially after that
in

san francisco new orleans rio de
janeiro rome kinshasa karachi
bangkok then peking

mean

that the virus be taken from philadelphia
to san francisco then to new orleans
rio de janeiro rome kinshasa karachi
bangkok then peking

and you only goal be

to find out where the virus be so a
qualify scientist can travel back into
the past and study the original virus

so that

uh so that a vaccine can be developed
that will uh allow mankind to reclaim
the surface of the earth
o
s

this be from a magazine printed in late
september
the writer speculate
that this graffiti might be related to
the epidemic that by that time have
already killed thirty million people
worldwide and be get bad
he
say certain people unnamed be
question but what come of that be not
known

pusillanimous pretendfriendto
animal
i will tell you why
because
when i have anything to do with she six

then how come she know what be going on

here i theory on that
while i be
institutionalize i brain be studied
exhaustively in the guise of mental health
i be interrogate xrayed studied
thoroughly
then everything about i
be enter into a computer where they
created a model of i mind
cont

then use the computer model they
generated every thought i could possibly
have in the next say ten year which
they then filter through a probability
matrix to determine everything i be
going to do in that period
so you
see she know i be going to lead the
army of the twelve monkey into the
page of history before it ever even
occur to i
she know everything
i be ever going to do before i know it
myself
