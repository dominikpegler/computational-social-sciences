i be so proud of you ronnie

do you think i do good

hell yes
you be great

ah you be just drink

nah you do good

yeah i usually do not come out to
the forefront like that


i official order be observe and
report but when mark put i in
charge of mall security something
inside of i changed
it be what
i have always wanted
thing
have not always work out with
the whole
well you know
but
this give i faith that i can do
something great
this be i call
to duty and i be going to answer
i be going to bust this fucking
pervert
i swear it on everything
i be
anyway i well get to
sleep
i get a big day tomorrow
good night mom
mom

you working the door here

that be what they tell i
they
needed to hire a little security
here in case the drunk get out of
line or whatever

kind of funny they think they
needed more security here
ha
you do realize that if anyone get
out of hand you need to call i
to handle the situation

i work for OCharleys not for
the mall


grant but you realize that i
jurisdiction supersede any and
all other form of security when
under the roof of carolina mall

you know i think about get
a job as a mall security

you do

yeah man
i mean i be kind of on
extended vacation from college and
it be just like i do not want to do
shit you know what i mean
i
parent said i have to work if i
want to live at home but i just
do not feel like do anything
this be the easy job i could
find i mean what the hell could
be hard about be a bouncer in a
mall restaurant
but now that i
think about it mall security
could be easy than this

i young friend you be sorely
mistake
do you know how much
stuff i be in charge of

no

shitload
that be not even
counting the park lot

really
i think you just kind
of chill out and called stuff
into the police

no way that be about like
maybe percent of it
there be
so much other stuff

like what


two word friday night

what about it

it be crazy let we just leave it at
that

okay

listen
i like you but i do not
like the fact that you be
masquerading as an official in the
security world
if you be serious
about a career in the security
world then perhaps i could look
into get you a job on i
staff

oh yeah

part of i job be reaching out to
trouble youth such as yourself
it be who i be

do it pay more than
an
hour

seven even

i would say that be more than i be
making now

hold on this job involve a
probationary period
you have to
prove yourself worthy
we can not
just hire any old tom dick or
harry just because they want to
carry a flashlight


what do i have to do

you have to complete a term as
deputy
you will answer directly
to i
you job will be to come
and find i if you see any
trouble
if this work out then
i will phone the crime into the
police
now this will train you
eye to spot various criminal
activity
once you have completed
you train you will be award
an official position on i
security staff where you will have
the duty of actually phone in
crime to the police yourself

so basically i just do what i be
do now and then you will get i a
job

for starter

how long do this mentorship
last

until mark let we i hire another
guy

can i smoke while i work

yes you can

sign i up

you keep that attitude up and
you will have no problem making the
squad

what be this


it be a flashlight
get to know
it
it be you new good friend
until you get you giant
flashlight
then that will be
you new good friend

attitude for you

you know i remember when i get i
first flashlight

inspector on the case and head of
mall security here at carolina
mall and this be i lieutenant
dennis
from one law enforcement
officer to another i just want to
welcome you and say that we will
do whatever it take to coordinate
with you department in order to
bring this assailant to justice

great
okay brandi

for now
i think the good thing
at this point be to just follow up
with the other lady who see the
perpetrator yesterday and see if
they remember anything

what if he come back

that be highly unlikely
these
incident be usually random and
unpredictable
i be sure you will be
safe


i be afraid i be going to have to
disagree with you there
detective
by i math it seem
pretty clear that brandis be
target

target
what give you that
impression

well how about the fact that she
be the first employee to get
assault
not to mention the
fact that she be the pretty
girl who work at this mall
to
i it seem obvious that this be
some sort of methodical villain
that plan on returning to finish
what he start by murdering
brandi

be that going to happen

that be not going to happen

well do not worry

crime we need to constantly be in
communication with each other and
have an open door policy with
intelligence
brandi let i see
that card

cool i will call you later with an
update

do not do that


it be no problem at all
we be
brother of the badge
this be
what we do for each other

seem like a good guy
little
green but still solid

what be you do

just putting these poster up

you have be so obsess with
catching this pervert i have barely
see you

that be what it be like when you
date the head of mall security
the downside be we do not get to
see each other as much but the
upside be you get to brag to all
you friend

well be you ready to go

sure let we take off


what be you do ronnie

come on let i get some of those
big bazoombas

ronnie no

goddamn it be we ever going to do
it

you know we talk about this

we do it be just well i be tire
of just do what we do
i be
ready for something big
like
sex or just maybe use a finger
on you

ronnie you know i be saving myself
for marriage
i think you be
okay with that

well i used to be it be just
i
do not know
what be so great about
be a yearold virgin

nell i be sorry
do not go away
like this


i think you loved i purity

i do
i really do
i be sorry
nell

it be okay
i should leave anyway
it be late

i will stop by for breakfast
tomorrow

see you tomorrow

mom wake up
let we go to bed


oh shit


good to see you brother
look
like the old team be get
together to crack one more case

i be ready to go to war with you

thanks for waking i up this
morning ronnie

i have already check the security
tape
they do not catch a thing
someone must have broken in here
and turned they off

i team just checked all the door
and there be no sign of forced
entry
i have also check out the
crime scene but we do not see any
fingerprint on the glass
the
suspect be probably wearing
glove

that do not sound good
how do
they do it

laser technology

i guess it be an inside job
probably someone who have access to
key like a janitor or a security
guard

detective harrison can i ask you
how long you have be a detective
for

i be almost at the end of i first
year


just as i think a rookie

i have be a police officer for
several year

yeah you be a rookie okay
it be
fine you will learn with
experience
and when you do
you will discover that rule of
law enforcement be that you do not
ever turn on a fellow officer
now i know you would never
actually accuse somebody on i
security force of commit this
act of lawlessness

whoever do this would have to have
key to the security room so they
could shut off the camera

look i record speak for itself
and as for dennis well i can
certainly vouch for he
dennis
be one of the fine man i know
so just take i word you be
bark up the wrong tree
now
let we put this little squabble
behind we and get back to bust
the guy that robbed this mall

ronnie nobody be accusing
anybody but i would like to stick
around for a while and interview
some of the employee

little push to get i over this
hurdle i have be stick on
how
can you be with a man who be not
living the life he be mean to

yeah something like that
and
just you know you be a security
guard at the mall and it be like

officer

we be always on the hunt for new
recruit

high school diploma

we usually prefer an actual
diploma but be technically
acceptable
be you a citizen of
the united states

okay mr
Barnhardt there be
several step you have to complete
in order to be eligible for the
police academy
physical
evaluation psychological test
background check


if you pass these test you will
be admitted to the police academy
now i like to tell all new
recruit that they should complete
a ride along before making this
decision
it be where you actually
ride along with a real police
officer during a routine patrol
it help give you an idea of the
kind of situation you will be
dealing with
sound good

that sound fun
sign i up

it be like it be mean to be
you
behind the wheel
i riding shotgun
two brother of the badge unite to
form the ultimate crimestopping combo
i be psych to be here harrison
thank you for the opportunity

you request to ride along with i

i know
you want to know the
truth
it be because i respect
you
see when we be at the mall
it be obviously i turf
sure i
break you ball about be a
rookie but out here in the
street i be the rookie
i be here
to learn
teach i

why do you want to become a cop

i have wanted to be a police officer
all i life


do not get i wrong i love keeping
the mall safe but you guy be
the one that really enforce
justice and protect not just we
mall but we whole community
i
do not tell the guy on i squad
this but the security guard job
be just temporary

well just pay attention tonight
and make sure you stay out of the
way

right we be not back at the
station anymore so we can cut the
charade

what be you talking about

well i know that policy demand i
stay out of the way but between
you and i i just want you to
know that if anything pop off
tonight i be going to jump right
in there and take they down with
you

no no
ronnie policy say you
have to stay in the car

i get you
you have to say this
in order to keep you safe
legally speaking
i should
probably follow along too
i
swear i will not get out of the car
and fight justice tonight


ronnie you really can not

i know


i be glad we understand each other

yeah so then i basically see his
ass trying to circumvent around
the ped exit and slip through the
employ exit
not allow
the
two ped exit be to be used
only

you see that corner there ronnie

yeah i see it

that corner used to be the bad
corner in this whole town
it be
riddle with drug prostitution
and gang violence
it be
nickname the crossroads


shit i have hear of that

that be right but myself and the
other officer work on clean
it up for year so that the good
folk of this neighborhood
would not have to worry about be
safe
yes sir that corner be a
testament to the fine police work
of we force

i do not know
it look pretty
shitty to i


well it be a low income area
ronnie
you be be kind of
prejudice

oh yeah i can see that it be
basically a fine neighborhood

that be right but it have not be
easy
we still patrol this area
every night just to keep we
presence up

i use that same technique at the
mall

i be sure
i usually do the foot
patrol myself but because i like
you i be going to let you do it
tonight

really

yeah really
but i told you
about department policy so i be
going to need you to keep quiet
about this one

you can count on i
thank you
for the honor

believe in you

i will not let you down


where be you going

matter

citizen arrest

i place you under citizen arrest
for the crime of selling a
schedule narcotic
you have the
right to remain silent


if you cannot afford an
attorney one will be appointed to
you
now i guess we just wait
here for i ride to come back

that be i little brother you get
there

who this little guy right here

that be right

well i hate to be the one to tell
you this but it appear that you
little brother have tried to sell
i illegal drug

hard for you to hear that

like you get one less employee
because i be taking little brother
down
i will die right here before
i let crime prevail

free to go little brother

mistake completely
good luck
with the crack

i be get shit
from the owner of the mall
sales

sufficient firearm

plan
come on in charles

who be this

this be charles sir

how be it going

you work at OCharleys right

that be right


mark i would like to hire charles
here as an additional security
guard
he would operate under i
i figure with the additional
criminal element we should hire
more security in hope that we
would have a good chance of
catching these guy

do you have any experience son

not really

um sir i have personally be
train young charles for week
now in preparation for this day
the kid kind of look up to i
i be some what of a big brother to
the little guy

alright it be actually not a bad
idea
it might make we security
more visible so we can give people
the illusion that we be on top of
this

thank you mark

ronnie one more thing
look if
this crime do not come to an end
pretty soon we be going to have to
let someone go
i mean you have
always do a great job for i
but the truth be someone be going
to have to take the fall
you be
the one who wanted to be head of
mall security and quite frankly i
just buy i wife a new
cadillac so let we just say it
will not be i

like a rambo kind of guy
man
who roll solo
take care of
business on he own term

i want to become a cop to help
people
the world be a scary
place with lots of evil
everywhere

vision of evil trying to get at
the world from every angle and
there i stand at the top of it all
