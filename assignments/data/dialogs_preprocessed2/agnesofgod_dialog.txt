question

one

what

where do you think baby come from

from they mother and father of
course
before that i
i do not
know

well i think they come from
angel
light on they mother chest and
whisper into she ear
that make good
baby start to grow
and bad baby
come from when a fall angel squeeze
in down there and they start to grow
grow till they come out down there
i do not know where good baby come out
and you can not tell the difference
except bad baby cry a lot
and they
make they father go away
and they
mother get very i will
die sometimes
agnes sit down on a bench and martha follow she
cont

mummy be not very happy when she die
and i think she go to hell because
every time i see she she look like she
just stepped out of a hot shower and i
i be never sure if it be she or the lady who
tell i thing
they fight over i all
the time
the lady
i see when i be ten
i be
lying on the grass looking at the sun and
the sun become a cloud and the cloud
become a lady
and she told i she would
talk to i
and then
she foot begin to
bleed and i see there
there be hole
in she hand and in she side
and i tried to
catch the blood as it fell from the sky but
i could not see any more because i eye
hurt because there be big black spot in
front of they
and she tell i thing like
like
right now she be crying marie
marie
but i do not know what that means
martha stand up disturb
agnes be slightly delirious with
cont

and
she use i to sing it be as
if she be throwing a big hook through
the air and it catch i under i rib
and try to pull i up and i
i can not
move because Mommys holding i foot
and all i can do be sing in she voice
it be the Ladys voice god love you
and she cry echo all around and the dove fly out of the
cont

god love you

do you know a marie

no
do you

why should i

i do not know
mother miriam be standing checking some paper when martha

well
what do you think
be she
totally banana or merely slightly
off centre
or maybe she be perfectly
sane and just a very good liar

what be you opinion

i believe agnes be different

from other nun
yes i
i have notice

from other people
i believe she be not crazy nor be she
lying

how could she have a baby and know
nothing of sex or birth

because she be an innocent
she be a slate
that be have not be touched except by god

that be ridiculous

move to she desk
start write
in she case it be not
she be have very little
schooling
she mother keep she home
almost all the time and when she mother
die agnes come here to we
she be never
be out there doctor
she be never see a
movie or a television show
she be never
even read a book

if she be so innocent how come she
murdered a child

she do not
this be manslaughter not
murder
she do not consciously kill that
baby
she would lost a lot of blood
she be
unconscious by the time we get to she

so someone else could have do it

no
not in the eye of the police

and in you eye

i have already tell you what i think

that she be unconscious yes
so
someone easily could have come in
the room and killed the

you do not really believe something like
that happen do you

it be possible be not it

who

one of the other nun find out about
the baby and
and wanted to avoid a
scandal
mother miriam remove the tray from under a pot plant and

that be absurd

that possibility never occur to
you

noone know about agnes pregnancy
noone
not even agnes
Marthas car exit out of the convent and head up the road
the car radio be playing light band music

inclination how could i possibly catch
she

how

i tied the cord around she neck
wrapped she in the bloody sheet
and stuffed she in the trash can
mother miriam give a shudder sigh make the sign of the
shaft of sunlight shine through the winter cloud onto the
all the main character be present
eve lyon martha

in view of the situation as it now
stand and the testimony given here
this morning it seem quite clear
that the defendant be in no manner
responsible for she action
it be
therefore the judgement of this court
that she be return to the convent of
marie madeleine where she will be care
for under proper medical supervision by
a visit physician
both martha and mother miriam show relief at this
justice
to sum up in french when suddenly agnes stand up
cont

Oui
do you have something to say

i stand in the window of i room
every night for a week
and one night
i hear the most beautiful voice
imaginable
and when i look i see
the moon shining down on he
for six
night he sing to i song i would never
hear
and on the seventh night he
opened he wing and lay on top of i
all the while he sing
charlie sweet
charlie sweet
charlies a

please remove she from the court
martha and mother miriam step forward uncertainly

would someone please remove the
defendant from the courtroom
the nun lead agnes still singing past martha and out of the

it be full winter
many shot of the convent and surroundings
into one another



i do not know the meaning behind the
song she sing
perhaps it be a song
of seduction
and the father be a
fieldhand
perhaps the song be simply
a lullaby that she remembered from many
year ago
and the father be hope and
and love and desire
and a belief in
miracle
the nun be see walking together through the snow back to



i want to believe that she be blessed
and i do miss she and i hope that she be
left something some little part of
herself with i
that would be miracle
enough would not it

where agnes be singing she song among the dove
she stop
it fly away across the snowy landscape
