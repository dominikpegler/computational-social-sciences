off where the arrow point

think she mean for we to follow

how should i know
she be wife

i think maybe we oughta

yeah i kinda figgered you would say
that
bein a new husband and all


maybe she left other sign for we to
follow but we will never know because
it snow all day and all the next
week
we be heading north through
the buffalo country when something
happen that i be not get straight
in i own mind yet

Ethans always be throwing it up
to i that i be a quarterbreed
i
never figgered it make much
difference

but this day we come on a small herd
we needed some meat so we circle
around

and come up on they afoot
they
have not be hunt so it be no
trick workin in close

ethan get a nice one on he first
shot but then he begin killing one
after another cow as well as
bull fast as he could fire and
load
it be just a slaughter
no sense to it

ethan quit it

nine
ten

what be the sense in it

hunger
empty belly
that be the
sense in it you cherokee

least will not feed any comanch
this winter
killin buffaloe as
good as killin Injuns in this
country

peaceful tribe depend on the buffalo
too

be not that too bad
if you feel
that sorry for you kinfolk i be
surprise you do not take up with
that squaw wife of yours



listen
hear it
there
be not
that a bugle
and fire

just hope we be not too late


it be all over long before we get
there and the soldier be high
tailin it back to the agency with
they prisoner squaw mostly
by the time ethan and i reach the
camp

it be the Nawyecky comanch all
right the one we would be looking
for all this time

trouble of it be that the soldier
have hit when most of the fightin
man be away huntin maybe
so
most of the dead be old man and
woman an kid
and it be in one
of the tepee ethan find she the
little squaw who wanted i to call
she look

well you be a widower now

Whatd the soldier have to kill she
for

ethan

look
it be hers Debbies

so we know debbie have be in the
village
what look be do there
whether she would come to warn they or
maybe to find debbie for i
there be
no way of knowing

we get to catch up with they yellow
leg
maybe they get she with they

and maybe they get scar


yes

we be looking for a girl a white
girl

she would be about thirteen now

we get two around that age

where

you will have to wait until we reach
the agency
fall in behind the
column

but could not you

sorry
keep the column moving
close
rank there


and it be clear to i the hostile
outnumber we four to one
with
all the advantage of terrain

four to one
what do you do general

sir we charge
gentleman
and i hope you will quote i i
cannot say too much for the courage
of the man who follow i into that
cheyenne camp

cheyenne
what cheyenne

i beg you pardon

that camp you hit be Nawyecka
comanche
chief scar bunch

scar
what a wonderful name

be you get this Keefer

how do you spell that word
Nawyecka

i name edwards
i be looking for
i niece
she be in that camp
when you attacked

well
i know there be some
captive recovered

four of they dead
so we be tell

unfortunately the hostile murdered
they as we developed the village

be you sure they do not die of
carbine shot fired by a bunch o
yank bluebellies so scare they
could not tell the difference between
a cheyenne and a comanche

Keefer
put this man under arrest

Thatll be the day
as we developed the village
next time you develop a village hit
it where the fightin man be
you will not get any headline for
killin squaw

shall i show he the captive sir

just get he out of here

yes sir
