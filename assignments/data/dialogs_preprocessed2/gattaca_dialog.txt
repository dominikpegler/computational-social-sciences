by andrew
Niccol
as nightfall do not come at once neither
do oppression
it be in such twilight that
we all must be aware of change in the air
however slight lest we become victim of
the darkness

mother nature i think mother want we to

you have a substance test

jerome
never shy
piss on command

i ever told

only every time i be in here

i see a lot of cock

if everything go to plan this could be the
last time i see you for a while
one week to
go
please tell i you be the least bit excite

i will tell you at the end of the week

the most unremarkable of event
jerome
morrow navigator first class be only day
away from a oneyear manned mission to
Gaspra in the outer asteroid belt
nothing so
unique in that
last year over one thousand
citizen from every walk of life embark on
some space mission or other
besides
selection for jerome be virtually guaranteed
at birth
he be blessed with all the physical
and intellectual gift required for such an
arduous undertake a genetic quotient second
to none

no there be truly nothing remarkable about
the progress of jerome morrow except that i
be not jerome morrow

i be conceive in the riviera
not the
french
riviera

the
detroit
variety

they used to say that a child conceive in love
have a great chance of happiness
they do not
say that any more

what be you do

i can not do this

i told you the government pay
it be all
taken care of

no you do not understand
i
can not

the doctor will give you something

i be not do it

honey you have make
one
mistake

i have read you profile
i do not
know about the father but you carry
enough hereditary factor on you own
you can have other child

not like
this
one

honey look around you
the world do not
want one like
that
one

you do not know what it will be

calling out to maria as she disappear
out of the door
the child will not thank you

those be early daysdays when a priest
could still persuade someone to put they
faith in god hand rather than those of
the local geneticist

what be wrong

of course there be nothing wrong with i
not so long ago i would have be considered
a perfectly healthy normal baby
ten finger
ten toe
that be all that used to matter
but now i immediate wellbeing be not the
sole concern


i destiny be map out before i
all i flaw predisposition and
susceptibility most untreatable to
this day
only minute old the date and
because of i death be already known



the name
for the certificate

antonio

no
vincent
antonio

oh vincent vincent vincent
i can not let
you out of i sight

i be born vincent antonio luca
and from
an early age i come to think of myself as
other think of i chronically i will
every skin knee and runny nose treated
as if it be lifethreatening

and i parent soon realized that wherever
i go i genetic prophecy precede i

they put off have any more child
until they could afford not to gamble
to bring a child into the world in what
have become the natural way

it mean selling the beloved buick

i father get a good price
after all
the only accident he would ever have in that
car be i

to the nurse without taking
he eye from he binocular microscope
put up the dish

you extract egg
note the couple name from
data along the edge of the screen
maria
have be fertilized with
antonios
sperm and we have perform an
analysis of the result preembryos
after screen we be left with two healthy
boy and two healthy girl
naturally no
critical predisposition to any of the major
inheritable disease
all that remains be
to select the most compatible candidate

first we may as well decide on gender
have you given it any think

refer to the toddler
on she knee
we would like vincent to have a brother
you know to play with

you have already specify blue eye dark
hair and fair skin
i have taken the liberty
of eradicate any potentially prejudicial
condition premature baldness myopia
alcoholism and addictive susceptibility
propensity for violence and obesity

we do not want
disease
yes

we be wonder if we should leave some
thing to chance

you want to give you child the best possible
start
believe i we have enough imperfection
builtin already
you child do not need
any additional burden
and keep in mind
this child be still you simply the
best
of you
you could conceive naturally a thousand time
and never get such a result

he be right maria
that be right

be there any reason you would want a lefthanded
child

er no

some believe it be associated with creativity
although there be no evidence
also for
sport like baseball it can be an advantage

i like football

i have to warn you mr luca he be going
to be at least a head tall than you
prepare for a crick in the neck in
sixteen year time

anything i have forgotten

we want himwe be hope he would get
marry and have child
we would like
grandchildren

i understand
that be already be taken
care of
now you appreciate i can only work with
the raw material i have at i disposal but
for a little extra
i could also attempt to
insert sequence associated with enhance
mathematical or musical ability

antonio the choir

i have to caution you it be not foolproof
with multigene trait there can be no guarantee

how much extra

it would be five thousand more

i be sorry there be no way we can

do not worry
you will probably do just
as well singing to he in the womb
we can implant the most successful
preembryo tomorrow afternoon

what will happen to the other

they be not baby maria merely
human possibility

small than a grain of sand

be

that be how i brother anton come into the
world a son i father considered worthy
of he name

vincent run from the room

by the time we be playing at blood
brother i understood that there be something
very different flowing through i vein

and i would need an awful lot more than
a drop if i be going to get anywhere

we favorite game be chicken
when we
parent be not watch we used to swim outside
the flag as far out as we dare
it be about
who would get scare and turn back first

of course it be always i
anton be by far
the strong swimmer and he have no excuse to fail

i genetic scarlet letter continued to follow
i from school to school
when you be tell
you be prone to learning disability it be
sometimes easy not to disappoint anybody

how many astronaut be there anyway

i bet
i
could be one

you be standing on venus

i be popular enough until it get around
that i be not a longterm proposition

those who do not know already could easily
find out for themselves
it be certainly
no problem coaxing the information out of i

i do not blame they
you need to know if a
prospective husband can qualify for a mortgage
or life insurance or can hold down a decent job

vincent you have to be realistic

heart condition like yours

i do not care
i will take the risk

it be not just
you
they have to be concern
about
perhaps we could get you one of
those new pacemaker
they be not perfect
but

for god sake vincent do not you understand
the only way you will see the inside of a space
ship be if you be cleaning it

i father be right
it do not matter how
much i lie on i resume i real

be
in i cell
why should anybody invest all
that money to train
i
when there be a
thousand other applicant with a far cleaner
profile
of course it be illegal to discriminate
genoism it be called but no one take the
law seriously

if you refuse to disclose they can always
take a sample from a doorhandle

or a handshake

even the saliva off you application form

but for the most part we know who we be
and if all else fail a legal drug test
can just as easily become an illegal peek
at you future in the company

i do not blame anton for he free ride
you
can not blame someone for winning the lottery

you sure you want to do this

it be the last time we swim together
out into the open sea like always
knowing each stroke towards the horizon
be one we have to make back to the
shore
like always the unspoken contest

vincent you damn fool
you could have killed
anton with you ridiculous contest
why should
he risk he life to save yours
when be you
going to get it through you thick headyou
can not compete with you brother
why try

why do not you say anything

why do not
you
it be okay
it be the way they want it

it confirmed everything in the mind of
i parent that they have taken the right
course with i young brother and the
wrong course with i
it would have be so
much easy for everyone if
i
have slipped away
that day
i decided to grant they that wish

like many other in i situation i moved
around a lot in the next few year get
work where i could
i must have cleaned
half the toilet in the state

when you clean the glass vincent do not
clean it too well

what do you mean

you might get idea

but if the glass be clean it will be easy
for you to see i when i be on the other
side of it

where be earl

he fell
lucky it be only the second floor

of course the good test score in the world
be not going to get i in the front door
unless i have the blood test to go with it

vincent i be german
that be i name

what do you think

i think i could do something
provided you know what you be do
and you can meet the term

you get a photo of yourself

i think i told you not to get any idea

vincent
vincent

german be that you

vincent come down
i have find he

for the genetically superior success
be easy to attain but be by no means
guarantee
after all there be no gene
for fate
and when for one reason or
another a member of the elite fall on
hard time they genetic identity become
a value commodity for the unscrupulous
one mane loss be another mane gain

enthusiastically reading from data on
he portable screen as he walk
he have the heart of an ox
he could run
through a goddamn wallif he could still run
actually he be a big college swim star

i hope he be not just a body

no problem
before he drop out he be
an honor student the right major

how do i square the accident

still reading data from his
palmtop computer
it happen in australasia
he checked
in yesterday
no family complication no
record he ever broke he neck
as far as
anybodies concern he be still a walk
talking fullyproductive member of society
you just have to get he off the pipe and
fill in the last two year of he life
excuse i
you
life

looking around for a likely
candidate but finding none
where be he

smile confidently
what do i tell you
which one the mirror

that be the hair color in he profile



yeah

i would have to bleach i hair

why be you invent problem
you two
be a couple of goddam clone
you look
so right together i want to double i fee

a thought occur address the
paraplegic for the first time
how tall be you

four foot six

okay how tall do you
used
to be

apathetic still under the
influence of whatever he be be smoking
six one

he be too tall

you can wear lift

even with lift i be never that tall

there be a way

i confess at first i wonder if i have rescue
a man who be already dead

you okay jerome

ironically refer to
they mutual immobility
yeah
you want to go dancing tonight

what be wrong with it

i think i would well choose the menu
after all
you be learning how to be i i be not learning
how to be
you

suit yourself

listen i do not want you to think i be ungrateful
i know you and that little brokerwhat do you
call he

german

you be both going to a lot of trouble
maybe you can con somebody into believe
you be i to get you foot in the doorbut
once you be inside you be on you own
i be
sure you be sincere
but i be be groom for something like
this myself
even without the accident i do not
think i would have make it
i point ishow the
hell do
you
expect to pull this off

i do not know exactly jerome

at least you be honest
call i by i middle nameEugeneIf you be
going to be jerome you may as well start
get used to it

i have to know where you come from

if anybody ask tell they the truth
you family disown you
you be a
disappointment jerome

what about this

wrong color
it be silver
it be not easy living up to this

wheel by looking over Jeromes
shoulder at the signature
it need work

you have to be a righthander

noone order southpaws anymore

myopia be a dead giveaway one of the early
and most justifiable of the qualityoflife
correction
anybody with impair vision be
certain to be suffering from all the other
deficiency of a nonadvantaged birth

it be no good
i can see an edge
he may as
well walk in there with a cane

you really need that much

more
than that
you will get used to it

god what
would not
you do to leave the planet

leave
just a few million year ago every atom in
this hairin we bodieswas a part of a star
i do not see it as leaving
i see it as going home

god you be serious be not you

it be not too late to back out

you do not know what a relief it be not to
be i
be you sure
you
want the job

what about you
what be in this for you eugene

listen i bag this stuff anyway
it may
as well pay i rent

congratulations

what about the interview

that be it

the majority of people be now madetoorder
what begin as a means to rid society of
inheritable disease have become a way to design
you offspringthe line between health and
enhancement blur forever
eye can always be
brighter a voice pure a mind sharpe a body
strong a life longer
everyone seek to give
they child the good chance but the most skilled
geneticist be only accessible to the priveleged few

anyone who be the product of an alter
be proudly referred to as a
selfmade man or woman manchild

those parent who for moral or more likely
economic reason refrain from tampering with
they offspring genetic makeup or who fail
to abort a deprive fetus condemn they child
to a life of routine discrimination

officially they be called invalid
also
known as godchildren menofgod faith birth
blackjack birth deficients defective
genojunk gegnomes the fuckedup people

they be the healthy i will
they do not
actually have anything yet they may never
but since few of the precondition can be
cured or reversed it be easy to treat they
as if they be already sick

by means of a donor i have cheated the
system for the last four year to open door
that would otherwise be closed to i

in the guise of jerome Morror i have rise
quickly through the rank of Gattaca
only one
of the mission director have ever come close
to discover i true identity

strange to think he may have more success
expose i in death than he do in life

awful

yeah awful it do not happen
sooner

you be lucky to be get out of this

we be still going ahead as planned

the launch window be only open until week
end
tragic though this event may be it
have not stopped the planet turning

you will have to excuse i jerome
i have to
meet with the authoritiesnaturally we be
cooperate in any way although i will not
tolerate a major disruption
i wish i be going with you jerome

i have good thing to do this week than
answer the foolish question of some flatfoot
do not you

well shall we say we spent the evening together

to be convincing jerome i would have to know
what that be like

you do not forget the truffle

sensing something amiss trying
to keep he humor
who die

the mission director

community

the Beltyou of all peoplenever mean to be
born on a mission to discover the origin
of life

you should be going instead of i

up there they would not be a problem

you know i be scare of height

to the tongue as he insert the
tip of the swab into an analyzer
let we see what you have get to say for yourself

the tongue be male
mature
Blonse hair
brown eye
light complexion
between
and
pronounce caucasian nose
thin lip
weak chin
Lobeless ear
prematurely balding
slightly bowlegged
broad shoulder
barrel chest
blind

timea nonothing case like this

mane dead detective

of course sir
we be checking the entry log
alibi grudge

grudge

i look around i see a lot of dry eye
the director be not
universally loved
he be leading the
cutback in the program
you be looking at
a room full of motive

shaking he head adamantly
refer to the bag in he hand
no
this
be you man

with respect Sirit may be the only
unaccountable specimen but the profile
suggest

what
about
he profile

accord to this he be a sick man
congenital
heart condition
who know how long the specimen
have be here but there be an percent chance
the owner of that eyelash have already die
himself from natural cause

so there be a percent chance he be
not
dead

even if this vincent luca
be
alive be it
likely he could bludgeon a man to death

no
not
likely

i take it you be think along the line of a
robbery go soura thief disturbed in the act

of course that do not jibe with what we
find
this be an angry kill

who know with these deficients
he profile
indicate a proclivity for violence

i will run a crossover on the eyelash for
any family or associate connection

i have already run it
there be no record
of any live relative

what a pity

detective hugo it be a simple case of lose and
find
all we have to do be locate the man who be
minus an eyelash and this murder will solve itself

napoleon you be late for you substance test

director napoleons helping i today

well you take it
for
he jerome

goddamn metronome
i could play piano by that
heartbeat of he

director josef this be we lead investigator

how often do you test director

surely you know what you have

we have to be certain
once they be up we
can hardly turn the boat around

i swear if i go to lunch and come back he would
still be there

the skin flake be find in michaels restaurant
the employee be all account for

customer
do this michaels cater to misfit

shifting the view of the map
to include the Gattaca complex
no
but one or two borrow ladder have
show up there in the past

we have to consider the possibility that he be
playing somebody else hand

taking a perverse pleasure in the
slowly dawn revelation
of course
he be a degeneerate
glance to a photo of the
Gattaca crime scene
he work at Gattaca
why else would we find
the eyelash near the washroom
nobody stop to
take a leak during a murder

it be still possible the eyelash specimen come
from a janitor delivery manit could have blown
in through an open window

he be afraid of be exposed
that be why he do it

it be hard to believe he could be one of
they elite worker
you have see they
security system
they know who work there
even if you ignore the mane expiration date
he profile suggest that he do not have the
mathematical propensity let alone the stamina
to pass they physicals

do not underestimate these imposter

skeptical refer to a file of
Gattaca employee photo
none of the photo match the enhancement

man can change he facebut blood be forever
sample every employee within the parameter i give you
intravenous

you know they workforce
Twothirds at
least fall into the category
we will be
closing down they operation for day
at least go with a fingertip sample or urine

blood
from the vein

look like anybody to you

not to i

ugly sonofabitch though be not he

somewhere in the dust of Gaspra be the key
back to the begin of the bookthe life we
become
with the original build block who
know how far we can take the godding

even someone as advance as jerome will be
last year model by the time we be do

i would not get you hope up commander

excuse i mr morrow
the investigator have
begin they test

this be so inconvenient irene
they can
make an exception for jerome

i be afraid not

i apologize jerome

it be not yor fault director
if you predecessor be still around
we may not be going to Gaspra at all
that be what
i
would call inconvenient

what be with the plunger lamar
what be
you do opening a blood bank

the gentleman of law enforcement be concern that
i test method may have be compromise

damn

JesusI be sorry jerome

you must be out of practise lamar

examining and remove the
switched vial from the bend syringe
i have get enough here

regarding the squimish detective
as he hold the gauze to he arm
need any more you can always get it off he shoe

another

so you do not do it after all

i guess somebody beat i to it

that be the last

something not right

he be not here
it be a blind alley

no we have missed something
we hoover again

we do not have the manpower

get it
from outside if you have to

from what budget

i will take it out of you damn
pension
if
you question i authority one more time

would you care to lookin the telescope

thank you no

one look through there and you would know why
i can not possibly allow you to disrupt operation
any far

you be so unconcerned that you have a killer
in you midst

right now
you
presence be create more of
a threat
i do not think you have any concept
of what we do herehow meticulous we
preparation must be
we be about to send
twelve people through million mile of
blackness to rendezvous with an object the size
of a house and the color of coal
so it be rather
critical to point they in the right direction
and we certainly do not need you looking over we
shoulder
besides i do not believe there be
any evidence that the killer
be
amongst we
i
do not see too many other dead body litter
the place

no but since there be not too many
live
one
tonight either you will not mind we conducting one
**further/far sweep
if he do not work here then
there should be no other trace of he
i think you would well get some people out of bed
detective
in the meantime we can recheck he favorite
haunt

the conversation will just keep get longer

how long

by the time i be at the belt you phone and
say how be you
Fortyfive minute
later i reply not bad

i guess i would well have something important
to say if it take that long to get an answer

you have never be here
let i order for you

i would well not

i eye be not so good

i bet

sir

to the still daze detective
examining he injury
do he hit you with he fist

more like a hammer

do not touch you face
do not swallow

where do we start

we will vacuum these street if we have to

we caught they trying to flush these sir

so sure of what you can not do

what happen

you remember the chrysler lebaron
it be the exact height of the front fender
look right instead of left

so you be not so smart after all
i want you to knowif it ever come to it
i would be will to get an ovum from the egg
bank
in fact i would
rather
use a donor egg

if
it come to it

but if it come to it then it could not have you
nose
how perfect do you child have to be

mildly irritated by what she
perceive as he mocking
you hypocrite
do you think for one moment
you would be do what you be do if it be not
for who you be
what
you be
do not you get
any
satisfaction knowing that you child
will be able to live to a ripe old age unless
they do something foolish

that be precisely what
scare
methat they
will not do anything
foolish
or
courageous
or
anything
worth a goddamn

i wife and Iwe be think of starting a family

why not

these new personality correction i have be
reading about

you worried about the cost

not that

they said the same thing about myopia and
obesity
you think you child would be
less human if they be less violent angry
spiteful
maybe they would be
more
human
from
where i sit the world could stand a little
improve

do not touch that
it be evidence

positive saliva match
the cup be
definitely used since the original sweep

so we have two choice
either we suspect
come back to the murder scene for a drink of
water and i do not know anybody that thirsty or
he
be
here
we test again
you be right hugo this be a
desperate act
someone have a lot to lose that
nightperhaps they place in line
i would like the profile of everyone with an
upcoming mission

twelve have a mission within the week

this time i will supervise each test personally

little nausea
quite common

i will not permit any far test on the
eve of a mission
we be already counting
backwards

i will call and let he know

let we not spoil the surprise

gazing at the director struggling
to come to grip with the turn of event
this can not be he

we find he spit in the dead director eye

suit he wear on the night
what more do you

luca could still be an accomplice

finally i would like to welcome navigator morrow
on he debut missionif we get lost out there
nobody have a map of the heaven in he head like
jerome

hanging over tomorrow launch
now we can put
this unpleasantness behind we and concentrate
on the task at hand
i do not have to tell you how
important this mission isthe belt could hold
the key to the origin of life why we be what
we be
i know many of you have be asking that
question about
i
for long enough

of a misshapen asteroid behind he head
Gasprahow could something so ugly hold so

he be probably leaving some more of i
around the place before he go

do not be deceive irene

something i could never do

what be wrong with he

you have more in common than you know

any
of this

now be you chance to find out

other side
how far do you want to
go
do you want to drown we both
how be we going to get
back

you wanted to know how i do it
that be
how i do it anton
i never saved anything
for the swim back

here take it

echoing irenes word from
they first encounter
if you be still interest let i know

never taking she eye from he echoing
Jeromes word from they first encounter
sorry the wind caught it

year be a long time

i have you sample ready

have you forgotten
i do not need any sample
where i be going

no but you might need they when you get back

everything you need to last you two lifetime

there be an extra specimen
i wish i
could give it to she myself
but then you always be good at be i

struggling to come to term
with the discovery
why have you do this

in case you get back before i do

where be you going

i be travelling too

thank you

i get the good end of the deal

not until you be upstairs

what be this lamar

new policy

intrigued by the
outofcharacter discharge
flight get you nervous

there be a problem lamar

do i ever tell you about i son jerome
he be
a big fan of yours
he want to apply here

just remember lamar i could have go up

for future reference
a brief glance to where
jerome have just zip he fly
righthanded man do not hold it with they
left
it be just one of those thing

have a safe trip vincent

we come from the star so they say now
it be time to go back
if i be conceive
today i would not get beyond eight cell
and yet here i be
in a way they be
right i do not have the heart for this world
the question be why be i have so much
trouble die
in a few short year scientist will
have completed the human genome project
the map of all the gene that make
up a human being
after billion year of evolution by the
slow and clumsy method of natural selection
we have now evolved to the point where we
can direct we own evolution
if only we have aquired this knowledge
sooner the follow people would never
have be born

blind from birth

epileptic

arthritic

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis

alzheimers disease

blind and deaf

lou Gerhigs disease

asthmatic

chronic invalid
even charles darwin the man who told of
the survival of the fit numbered
amongst we frail
of course the other birth that would
surely never have taken place be you own
