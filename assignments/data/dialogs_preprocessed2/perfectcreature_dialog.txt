for three hundred year the great plague have
sweep the earth

lilly
thinking they have discover god secret code for
life the alchemist experiment with genetic
science
they have no idea what they have
unleash
we begin to see a strange medallion sweeping through smoke slowly
revealing itself

but there be also a miracle
one of these
plague helped nature create a new kind of be
at first they be called nosferatu or vampire
and be feared
but they be not supernatural
monster just a good version of ourselves
they be the brother and they religion and
science helped sustain we against the plague and
influenzas that have ravaged europe and the rest
of the colony
for year we two race have
live in harmony
until now

we be very close on a bespectacled eye
it stare at we and
then look down

see here
this be what you need to
look for
cut to the object in the genetic doctor hand
it be like an
xray yet the image look remarkably like a profile

continue
off
genetic mutation we all carry
it
but we now know a virus
activate it


this virus play some unknown role
in the birth the brother
of
course the mutation occur very
rarely these day
and only in
male

vehicle for a miracle

baby view in an operate theatre
cut to
the woman we see early with the genetic doctor
she have
just give birth
the baby be place on linen blanket and
cleaned by a nurse
man now enter the operate theatre
we can tell the
doctor be uneasy
the man be dressed in a perfectly cut suit
he do not wear a surgical mask
he eye be a piercingly
clear light gray
he enter with two other man who look
similar to he
by he side there be also a pristine boy
perhaps year old the same pierce eye
they both
approach the baby
the man stare serenely at the baby all
bloody lying on blanket

will teach he
the little boy then share a glance with the woman who have
just give birth
she seem to recognize the boy

be that i mother

no not any more
augustus then lean forward and gently open the baby mouth
we see the baby close
in the otherwise babylike mouth we
see something strange
there be two tiny fang protruding
from the otherwise smooth gum
we see augustus smile
in he mouth too we see two perfectly
point tooth

welcome to the world little
brother
cut to
we end close on the baby
it pierce eye


perfect creature
the title fade
then another title appear
queens imperial winter residence
the pacific colony
year later

we see a city sethe with smoke from coal fire steam
from engine alien distort victorian spire be
silhouette against the moody moonlit sky which be literally
filled with dirigible and strange fly machine that seem
victorian of the industrial revolution but that be also
strangely futuristic
it be but not we
street
the look of the film and the night be silver
almost metallic moonlit sky
hazy mist hang in the air
wet steel pool of water on the dark footpath where a man
stand
he stare up at a zeppelin passing overhead it
shadow obscure he briefly until it pass away
then we
see he
the man be handsome in a perfectly cut long wool jacket
dark gray
he wear perfectly shiny black shoe and we can
see the surround street reflected in they
victorian
gothic building
this man be Silus
he survey the street
while the house be beautiful they be run down
Silus he eye be the pure light gray you have ever
see take a long long inhale through he nose he eye
closing briefly as if trying to sensesmell something
he
stop the breath and open he eye
they be clear full of
purpose
he bend down to the footpath run he hand along it
surface almost caressing it
he close he eye
the camera
move in to end close on Silus ear
as this happen the
soundtrack all the noise in the night become amplify
we see Silus face see he concentrate intently
we hear
several individual noise
first a very quiet pitter patter
cut to
cat stealthily moving between some thorny rose bush
cut to


man
with reflective animal eye and blood on he purple
lip
and tooth
the tooth of a vampire
this creature
immediately dive from the wall to the ground just avoiding
another two bullet that crash into the wall
as the man fall directly towards the camera
Silus now rush forward holding he gun out in front of
he
he move forward gracefully
he can see the man
skillfully climbing up an adjacent derelict build
Silus
try to follow but he way be blocked by wire and fence
he raise he gun towards the man once more but he be go
close on Silus enigmatic face
those eye
and in he mouth
two perfectly point fang
cut to
we be outside a cafe
the cafe be a warm glow against the
cold night
we see past the fine falling rain through the
large glass window that have swirling silver art nouveaux
design lace across it to a table inside by the window
where two pristinely dress man sit
cut to
we be inside
closer on the two man
one be
the other
man be
the man we see in the operation theatre
before
augustus have hardly aged at all

the girl
we see Silus
he remember
cut to
flashback from Silus memory
a dead girl on a bed blood
splattered across she pillow
cut to

Silus face
pull out to reveal we be back in the cafe

it be taken care of

this be good

augustus
we failed this girl
we
ask she to help we catch he
and then we failed she

yes
but she death serve a
great good
every trap need
bait
augustus lift a beautifully design glass and silver pipe
from the onyx table at which they sit then settle back into
a fine hardwood chair
the chair swirl delicate back
creek as he take a puff on the pipe

be you sure you will not join i
Silus shake he head no
the opium in the pipe crackle

perhaps this be beyond we
perhaps
we should inform the authority
the human being
augustus place the pipe down blow a smoke ring as a
chinese woman dressed in a sarong bring over two finely
cut crystal glass and set they before the man then
leave
Silus now lift the glass and we see what it
contain
blood
dark and red and viscous
Silus take a sip
then look over to the bar
there be a young woman there sitting at the bar be
treated with great care by several of the elegantly dressed
patron
the young woman laugh enjoy the attention
tube run from the young woman arm
these tube carry she
blood into a conch shaped glass bowl
we see the chinese
waitress fill another glass from the bowl
Silus watch blood slightly present on he ashen lip
and
we see two perfectly pointed fang hanging in he mouth

for now the brother feel we
should deal with this ourselves


if they find out we be covering
up these death

which be why you must find he
Silus
Silus now turn to augustus still looking unconvinced

for century we brother have
serve mankind and they we
the
great union
but remember you
history
year ago when we
kind be first born into this
world they burn we child as
monster
they have no notion of
evolution
in another world we
might all have be slaughter
only to be remember in myth
monster to frighten the young or
a puzzle for anthropologist
we
must refuse to let one aberrant
individual destroy the balance
between the two race
the old
prejudice be still there
human
being be paranoid creature by
nature

perhaps they have good reason

Silus
simply concern yourself
with finding edgar
find you
brother so that we can help he
before he kill again
cut to
close up of a
on it we see a banner headline

we
pull out to reveal the paper be lying on a foot path

blow the newspaper out of shot and we tilt up to the street
the street be wet glistening
the rain rain rain rain
the
edwardian and victorian building of the street might seem

about time
they both move to one of the tall building

accompany by the whining sound of the internal mechanic

physical ease about she


matter of week

be there something wrong

yes
withhold evidence
covering up two murder
and no
one worry
if i or one of the
people in jamestown do that
they would be in the hell house with
the key throw away
it seem the
church be able to do whatever it
want

you be right to not like it
it be
political

we think we could find brother
edgar ourselves
we be wrong
but now any debate be pointless

the great danger be if this
be to become public knowledge

would not want anyone criticize
the church i suppose

it be more than that captain
this
be about prejudice or rather the
nature of it
as a female surely
you would understand


really

how many other captain in this
borough be female

none

how be you action judge the
same or differently from the man
lilly stare at Silus
he be an incredible being

differently

exactly
if a white man kill
then he be just a killer
if a
black man kill then all black
man be suspect
that be the
nature of prejudice
those who be
different be group together
if
only one brother do a bad thing
then all brother be suspect
because we be different
and then
what would this world be like if
there be no hope
lilly nod acknowledge the truth of it

alright then
so what do you
suggest

first there be something you
should hear
cut to
scummy large brief room
there be seven cop in here
perched on desk and chair
jones dominic frank plus four
other
lilly be also there
so be Silus sitting perfectly
still calm
several of the cop look at he suspiciously


ok ok quiet down

gentleman there be no other way to
put it
we have only day to
find the suspect

there be no chance
not a hope in
hell

he be right
we do not even know
where to begin

quiet

what you be about to hear will
not leave this room
everyone
understand
jones

i would suggest anyone with a weak
stomach leave now

this be brother Silus

thank you captain
could we have
the plate


senior brother edgar
until
week ago he be a trust and
talented theologian and scientist

Whatd he do

he be personally responsible for
developing the most recent
influenza antivirals
it be
because of he that most of you
be alive today
he behavior
appear normal
next

the victim
john anderson
julie
dane
tanya garfield
all in
they early s but beyond that
no obvious connection
next

there be no precedent for brother
Edgars behavior
no brother have
ever taken a human life not in
the year since we begin
not
one
we role have be to preserve
and maintain the human life
not
take it

next he will be wanting an fuck
medal

what i be saying to you be that
brother Edgars behavior be
aberrant
we


do not understand it
and therefore
it be difficult to predict
the
only thing we know be where he
will strike next

how do you know

please
please do not hurt i

quiet

please

i said shut up

jones unceremoniously push past Silus and move into
Lillys room
Silus read the newspaper
the story tell of
the recent death in jamestown explaining that it be an
insane man who think he be a brother
the mane picture be
show
it be actually one of the victim
through the window in the doorway Silus watch jones
approach lilly
we be close on he enigmatic face

we tilt down a grand build

huge foyer shin marble floor
all do in perfect
taste
we see Silus cross the foyer and enter an elevator
the elevator door close
Silus enter the room
there be several technician at work
at a console

obviously human
he lack of perfection stand out
the
balding hair dark ring under he eye
Silus join they

Silus shake the professor hand
we see the hand touching
then slide apart with a wisp sound that make the
professor wince a little

how be he

see for yourself
he tap one of the man at the console on the shoulder
the
man hit a button and we see that in front of the console
there be a huge glass window and beyond it a room which be
now light
edgar be in there
and edgar be not please
even from here
he glowering stare penetrate everyone in the room
from
this distance we can not make out much beyond the fact that
edgar be seated in a chair in an otherwise plain white room
around he chair be a strange brace of sort that seem to
be holding edgar in place

be the brace necessary

he decapitate a guard as they
bring he in
even though he be
sedate
he said he will drink we
all dry

insane then


not quite
Silus now turn to the professor

he be become infect

with what
the professor look to augustus as if worry he be say to
much

go on brother Silus will soon be
part of the inner circle of the
brotherhood
he should know this
cut to
approaching a curve glass and metal door
on the door

establisher
continue
there be bed in here
in they strap
down young woman
they be all insane monstrous
the
white of they eye be blood red
we see Silus observe they but there be no horror in his
eye just compassion
he move to one of the woman and
slowly grasp she hand
she lurch towards he

if she be not restrain she would
try to kill you
do not worry it be
only transmissible through they
blood
we design it that way
Silus quietly turn to the professor

design


genetically design
edgar be
experiment with the virus that
created you
it be sanction by
the government

since when do they sanction such
thing

since not one brother have be
born in year
and never a
female of you kind from which we
could breed
and we need to breed
more brother
you give the world
hope
to the people you be like
god walking the earth

this be what edgar be do
Silus
trying to genetically
control the birth of brother

and edgar be successful
each of
these woman carry a brother for
a time
but the virus
changed
most of they have die and these
will die soon

and edgar may be the first brother
to ever die


before that he brain will wither
like these woman
containment will
be the issue
cut to
door slamming behind Silus he be in a strangely eerily
lit cubicle

the police officer
lilly

she be lucky
but it be in
Edgars blood
it always will be
and another door in front of Silus click then slide
open to reveal
edgar sitting in the chair
he immediately turn to the
door he eye burrow straight into Silus
Silus move forward
we track Silus toward edgar and
the reality of he predicament be revealed
there be metal rod extend from the cage around he
two
at the side
two from the front
they strategically pointed
at Edgars chest and side
if he be to try to get up they
would pierce he

hello i brother

approaching a normal state

perhaps not quite so perfect
he radiate confident primeval
power

imperceptible hairline fracture

sending they both careen over a railing
low angle looking directly up at the two brother fall
bouncing and crashing off the rail on the way down

where subterranean mineral spring rise up from deep in the
earth and where the borough water supply be sterilize

be no anger there just desperation and behind that pity
the creature breathe it be last breath then collapse onto
lilly
edgar and Silus stalk each other in the steam room

and the rain

and then they both hear it
wail distort echoing
it
sound like a hurt animal
lilly look at Silus

hurry
lilly turn towards the build
she slowly move towards
it into the doorway as Silus watch she go
Silus turn to
the sunrise it reflect in he eye
cut to
lilly move through the derelict place past fall beam
it
seem empty
then lilly hear it again
wail
this time she
know what it be
we can tell from the way she eye glisten
she move forward close to the sound
and finally she see
the brother priest we see before who kneel in front of a
crate
he look up at she as she approach
as lilly move forward she see what lie with the crate
wrap in dirty sack there be a baby
in the corner lilly can see a woman the childes mother

first daughter given to we
lilly move forward
emotional music rise in the soundtrack
evoking memory the circle complete
lilly reach out
letting the baby girl grip she hand
lilly reach into the
crate draw the baby into she arm stare down into the
baby face
a face somehow already wise already serene
break tear run down Lillys cheek as she press the baby

baby tiny hand reaching out clasp onto she

come
before they find she

lilly exit the build
she look around for Silus but he
have go
she pause
through the mist and drifting smoke
from the fire we can see that in the distance a tarnish
sun be light the horizon

we must go
after a final pause lilly move off with the priest carrying
the tiny bundle with she

for i everything have changed now
because of Silus i see the world
through new eye

Silus on a fire escape in the shadow
go be the clothes
of the brotherhood rather he be dressed as someone who do
not want to be see

window into she apartment
a beacon of warmth in the night
in Lillys bed we can see the baby it hand happily making
pattern before it eye

now i see hope and i see a child
the first female of she kind
Silus scan the apartment
he can see the lounge

then jones
pick up two suitcase and move towards the door
Silus watch as lilly move into the bedroom and reach
