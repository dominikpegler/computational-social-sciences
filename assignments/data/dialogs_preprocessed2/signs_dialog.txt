woman stopped by the diner and
start yell and cuss because
they do not have she favorite
cigarette at the vend machine
scared a couple of customer
no
one see she since
i point
be we do not know anything about
the person you see
we should just
keep all possibility available

dad where be the remote

bo you be too old to still be
do this
the rule be you take
a glass of water you finish it
now what be wrong with this one

there be dust in it

this one

hair

this one

morgan take a sip
it have his
amoeba in it

exclude the possibility that a
female scandinavian olympian be
running around outside we house
last night what else be a
possibility

i be not do asking question and i
do not appreciate the sarcasm

do you have anyone who might have a
grudge or something against you
maybe a church member who might
not have like the fact that you
left the church

i do not think so

do you owe anybody money
you can
tell i off the record if you need
too

no

no

be anything miss

no

it be still making the noise
it be
break

it be old morgan

listen i be out of line with that
whole female scandinavian olympian
thing

it be just that i be pretty strong
and pretty fast
and i be running
as fast as i could
and this
guy
he be just toy with we


could everyone just take a seat on
the couch
i have some preliminary
thought

there be three possibility here
we will call they one two and three
the level one scenario be that
there be a sane individual who for
real reason want to do you harm
i really do not believe that be what
we be looking at here
in i
opinion whoever this be they
do not want to do harm to you all
that be kind of clear
the level two scenario be this be
a mentally unstable person who be
fixated on you and you family
this be a possibility but a very
slim one
i assure you i will treat all three
possibility carefully but in all
likely hood we be looking at what
we will call a level three scenario
he be a watcher
someone who this
be a game for
he be laying low
do not want to be see
but he
want to watch you
study you
folk

now i do not want you all to worry
about this no more
you be making
more of this than it be
you guy have have a tough couple of
day with the vandalism to the
crop and the death of you
shepherd
maybe you guy should do something
fun
let i worry about this
person
let i find out who it be
and then what the hell be you
people looking at

i will be damn

turn up the volume bo

i can not find the remote

image be shoot yesterday

seventytwo hour

crop circle first emerge in the
late seventies with the renew
interest in extraterrestrial life
they die out by the early
eighties
dismiss as hoax
this new resurgence be wholly
different
element of it be
unexplainable
the speed and the
quantity in which it have appear
imply the coordination of
hundreds of individual over many
country
there be only a limit amount of
explanation
either this be one
of the most elaborate hoax ever
created or basically
it be for real

extraterrestrial

what in god name be going on


do not ask i what i think
because i
can not think straight right now
i be going back to the station
have a cup of Marcias coffee and
try to think clear
after that i
might make some call
hoax

this be the end of the world

that be true

do you think it be a possibility

yes

how can you say that

that be not the answer you wanted

can you at least pretend to be like
you used to be
give i some
comfort

there be all different way
you can tell that there be someone
really there watch out for we
you see sign
sometimes they be
little one
you think of someone
the phone ring
they be on the
phone
sometimes they be big
like fourteen light hovering over
mexico city
sure there be a lot of people
watch this who think this could
be a bad thing
but there be a
lot of people watch this who
think it be a miracle
sign of
god existence
it be all in how
you look at thing merrill
what you have to decide be what
kind of person you be
be you
the type who believe in miracle
and look for sign or be you the
kind who believe thing just
happen by chance

i be at this party once
i be on a
couch with sara Mckinney
she be
just sitting there looking
beautiful and stare at i
i go
to lean in and kiss she and i
realize i have gum in i mouth
i
turn and take out the gum
stuff
it in i paper cup next to the sofa
and turn around
sara Mckinney
throw up all over herself
i know the second it happen
it
be a miracle
i could have be
kiss she when she threw up
that would have scar i for
life
i may never have recovered

i be a miracle man
those light
be a miracle

there you go

so which type be you

do you feel comfort

yes

what do it matter then

do you know what colleen last
word be before they killed she

she said see and then she eye
glazed a bit and she said
tell
merrill to swing away


do you know why she said that

because the nerve ending in she
brain be firing as she die and
some random memory of we at one of
you baseball game pop into she
head
there be no one watch out for we
merrill
we be all on we own


for the kid protection
all they
be do be watch from
five a
m
i feel like they be
get obsess like you said
they should be playing furry furry
rabbit or tea party or something
right

what be furry furry rabbit

that be a game be not it
anyway
there be be some interesting
development

what time be it

eleven a
m
they be go

but they be not really go
we
just can not see they
early this
morning a bird fly right at the
area where the light be hovering
last night

it stopped dead in the air and fell
straight down

they caught it on tape and they have
be playing it all morning
they
find the bird
he head crushed
in
when you see the footage it
look like the bird fly into a
wall in the sky
they think they have some invisible
shield thing going like an optical
illusion

the bird could have have a heart
attack and crush he head when he
fell

already thought of
two other
bird do the same thing an hour
later
not as dramatic
they
live
but you could see they hit
something

they be still there hover
in
fact some people think there be
more of they now
all over the
place
over we even
and there be a theory about the crop
circle now
they think it could
be some kind of landmark visual
map system so they can
navigate
coordinate
make sense
do not it



so the alien can not read we mind

oh

they tell you everything in this
book

it say they be probably very small
like i height because as
they brain developed there be
no use for physical development
it say they be probably
vegetarian because they would
have realized the benefit of such
a diet

who write this book

scientist who have be persecute
for they belief

that mean they be unemployed

dad be you going to be serious

yeah serious

i do not know what get into i

there be picture

dr
Bimboo one of the author of
the book

Bimboo

dad

i just ask he name

you have a tone

he say there be two reason why
extraterrestrial would visit we

to make contact in the spirit of
exploration and further the
knowledge of the universe

or the other reason
they be
hostile
they have used up the
resource on they planet and be
looking to harvest we planet next

look a little like we house
do not it

the same window

that be enough from dr
Bimboo for
now
