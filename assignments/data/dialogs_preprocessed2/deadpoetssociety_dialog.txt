science experiment radar

gentleman open you text to page
twentyone of the introduction
mr
perry will you read the open
paragraph of the preface entitle
understand poetry

understand poetry by dr

evans
pritchard ph

to fully understand
poetry we must first be fluent with
it meter rhyme and figure of speech
then ask two question
one how artfully
have the objective of the poem be
render and two how important be that
objective
question one rate the poem
perfection question two rate it
importance
and once these question have
be answer determine a poem
great become a relatively simple
matter

if the poem score for perfection be
plot along the horizontal of a graph
and it importance be plot on the
vertical then calculating the total
area of the poem yield the measure of
it greatness

sonnet by byron may score high on the
vertical but only average on the
horizontal
shakespearean sonnet on
the other hand would score high both
horizontally and vertically yielding a
massive total area thereby revealing the
poem to be truly great
as you proceed
through the poetry in this book practice
this rate method
as you ability to
evaluate poem in this matter grow so
will so will you enjoyment and
understand of poetry

excrement
that be what i think of mr

evans pritchard
we be not laying pipe
we be talking about poetry

i mean how can you describe poetry like
american bandstand
i like byron i give
he a but i can not dance to it

evans pritchard
now in i class you
will learn to think for yourselves again
you will learn to savor word and language
no matter what anybody tell you word and
idea can change the world
i see that look
in mr
pitts eye like nineteenth century
literature have nothing to do with going to
business school or medical school
right
maybe
mr
hopkins you may agree with he
think yes we should simply study we
mr
pritchard and learn we rhyme and meter
and go quietly about the business of
achieve other ambition
i have a little
secret for you
huddle up
huddle up

we do not read and write poetry because
it be cute
we read and write poetry
because we be member of the human race
and the human race be filled with passion
medicine law business engineering
these be all noble pursuit and necessary
to sustain life
but poetry beauty
romance love these be what we stay alive
for
to quote from whitman
i o life
of the question of these recur of the
endless train of the faithless of city
filled with the foolish
what good amid
these o i o life
answer
that you be
here
that life exist and identity
that the powerful play go on and you
may contribute a verse
that the powerful
play go on and you may contribute a verse
keating

for what we be about to receive may the
lord make we truly grateful
amen

mr
keating

i be sorry if i shocked you mr
mcallister

oh there be no need to apologize
it be
very fascinating misguided though it be

you think so

you take a big risk by encouraging they to
be artist john
when they realize they be
not rembrandts shakespeares or mozarts
they will hate you for it

we be not talking artist george we be
talking free thinker

free thinker at seventeen

funny i never peg you as a cynic

not a cynic a realist
show i the heart
unfetter by foolish dream and i will
show you a happy man

but only in they dream can man be truly
free
Twas always thus and always thus
