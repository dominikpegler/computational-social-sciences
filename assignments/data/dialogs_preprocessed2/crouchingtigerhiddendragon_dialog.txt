but i have have much practice
as a
child in the west a platoon live
with we
they would let i play with
they weapon
the scabbard be so

you be too young to understand

you be a sword fighter too

yes i be
but i prefer the
machete
certain move however
call for a sword

really

it must be exciting to be a fighter
to be totally free

fighter have rule too
friendship
trust integrity
without rule
we would not survive for long

i have read all about people like you
roam wild beating up anyone who
get in you way

writer would not sell many book if
they told how it really be

after all

be careful
sir te require
discretion

now
it be time for you to pay

you master underestimate we woman
sure he would sleep with i but he
would never teach i
he deserved
to die by a woman hand

you steal the secret of Wudans
high martial art
but after
ten year of train you move
be still undisciplined
and
today under a Wudan sword
you
will die

disciple we will kill they all

the green
destiny be mine
jade fox can not be

where do you learn
that xuan piu move

i be just playing around

tell i who be you master

let we go

we must kill they

father

this be tsai

i father
police inspector from
Shaan

this should be report to governor
yu
the victim be an officer
you
believe the killer be hide out in
he compound

i would bet i life on it

come with i

this need to be resolved and
quickly

i will get into the yu household and
get she
i will ferret out fox and
she gang

we must be careful
governor yu be
a court official and in charge of
security
any disturbance will
cast suspicion on he
it might
get sir te in trouble

this be a delicate matter

sir te can you find some excuse to
invite madam yu and she daughter

what do you have in mind

the good way to trap a fox be
through she cub

madam te be certainly spoiling we
with these wedding gift
she be
be so considerate

i be sorry she be not feeling well
enough to receive you today

i hear sir te lost something
and
now madame Tes not feeling well

we know who steal the miss item
if the thief return it i be sure
sir te will pursue the matter no
**further/far

that be good
sometimes the help
can not keep they hand to themselves
it be very embarassing

sir te know that even wellmeaning
people can make mistake
that
can bring ruin to themselves and
they family

but do not be too lenient

no mercy will be show toward the
murderer who turned up in peking

murderer

yes
the very killer of li mu
Bais own master
last night she
killed a policeman who have track
she down

female criminal
now that be news

you say she killed a policeman

yes from the west
he go
undercover and and follow she
here

maybe the murderer and the thief
be one and the same

i doubt it
this thief
it very
unusual

and most likely smart than a
mere killer

greeting sir te

hello madam yu

bai the renowned swordsman

delighted to meet you

where be you master

what be it to you

have enough fly
you have get
potential
you have studied the
Wudan manual but you do not
understand it
you need a real
master

do you think you be a real master

like most thing i be nothing
it be the same for this sword
all
of it be simply a state of mind

stop talking like a monk
just
fight

then tell i where jade fox be

on guard

real sharpness come without effort

no growth without assistant
no
action without reaction
no desire
without restraint
now give
yourself up and find yourself again
there be a lesson for you

go ahead

why should i
you need practice
i can teach you to fight with the
green destiny but first you must
learn to hold it in stillness

why do you want to teach i

i have always wanted a disciple
worthy of Wudans secret

and if i use they to kill you

that be a risk i be will to take
deep down you be good
even jade
fox could not corrupt you

Wudan be a whorehouse
keep you
lesson

you be home late
or should i say
early

why be you still here
you killed
a policeman
you should leave
you will bring ruin on i whole family

they would not have find i if you
have not stolen the sword
like a
little girl you think stealing
would be fun
you too be
responsible for that death
come
with i
you do not want to waste
you life as the wife of some
bureaucrat
deny you talent
as a master and disciple we will
rule

i will never live as a thief

you be already a thief

that be just for fun
how can i
leave
where would i go

wherever we want
we will get rid of
anyone in we way
even you father

shut up

it be the giang hu fighter
lifestyle
kill or be killed
excit be not it

i owe you nothing

yes you do
you be still i
disciple

you think you have be teaching i
all these year from the manual
you could not even decipher the
symbol

i studied the diagram
but you
hide the detail

you would not have understood even
if i have tried to explain
you
know
you have go as far as you
can go
i hide i skill so as not
to hurt you

if i have not see you fight with li
mu bai i would still be ignorant of
all you have hidden from i

master
i start learning from
you in secret when i be
you
enchant i with the world of
giang hu
but once i realized i
could surpass you i become so
frighten
everything fell apart
i have no one to guide i no one to
learn from

believe i i have a lesson or two
left to teach you

the sword be back
be you happy

i admit get it back make i
realize how much i would missed it

but it be not you sword anymore
you give it to sir te

true
but i must borrow it for one
last mission
jade fox must die at
it edge
do you know what you
be hide when you covered for
that girl

i job be to get the sword back
without embarass anyone
i
be not about to ruin she life or
she father

you do you job well
but this
girl
i see she last night

i know she would intrigue you

she need direction
and train

she be an aristocrat daughter
she be not one of we
in any case
it will all be over soon
you will
kill fox and she will marry

that be not for she
she should
come to Wudan and become a disciple

but Wudan do not accept woman

for she they might make an
exception
if not i be afraid
she will become a poison dragon

it be not we affair
even if Wudan
accept she she husband might
object

i think by giving away the sword
i could escape the giang hu world
but the cycle of bloodshed continue

i wish there be something more i
could do to help you

just be patient with i shu lien

lo

jen

you should not have come

with all the traffic on you
rooftop these day
it take i a
while to get in here
i can not wait
any longer
i be wrong to let you
go
come back with i
you will be
happy in the desert
you will be
free there

you have be looking for i all this
time

jen

if i have wanted to i would
already have do it
you must be
dying for a bath

i
though you be a han

fearsome bandit
he could not find
the star so he steal i comb

gang to stand a chance
slowly
you gang become you family
all
that dark cloud stuff be just to
scare people and make i life easier

so you be still that little boy
looking for shooting star

i be a man
and now i have find the
bright star of all
