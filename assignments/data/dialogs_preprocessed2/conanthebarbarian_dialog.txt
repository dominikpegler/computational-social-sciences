darkness consume the world
never

Kalba

of the earth
and here you be
just a two day ride from khor
Kalba
i can scarcely believe it

say nothing

yes

maybe he do not
know who we be
maybe he be not
looking for the queen

that be right i brother you have
be lie to all you live
tell
you must hide yourselves told you
be alone
i want you to look at
i and see i for what i be

brother
friend
i have come not
to hurt you but liberate you

you come for you own dark
purpose to raise Acheron

yes
i come to resurrect the
great empire Hyboria have ever
known

an empire of evil soaked in blood
sacrifice and the black of
magic

have you hidden from the world so
long that you cannot to see
blood
magic death
it be everywhere
Acheron be no different than any
other kingdom but for it glory


and in place of that glory you
offer shame
i know shame but that
be before i be show i true
lineage

when i be but a child raider
destroyed i village cut we
father to ribbon and burned we
woman as sacrifice to foreign god
those few who survive we run for
we live chase into cave at the
edge of the eastern sea left with
nothing to live for
but then we
discovered it
Acheron
the temple
that spawn an empire
we learned
that we be not broken goat
herder on a desolate coastline
we
be the son and daughter of
king
and queen

for thirty year i have search
for you
in that time i build both
an army and empire but they be
nothing compare to what we can
create together
we can raise
Acheron again
never again will we
hide like rat
never again will we
watch as we love one be
slaughter
i call forth the
queen
stand and join i and this
day will have a joyous end

you would have all the world
suffer as you have suffer
we
will die before we help you

yes
you will


the cave beneath khor Khalba
contain all manner of creature
many altered by century of
blood magic
but one in
particular have developed a special
connection to the blood
thirst
it be say that only the queen of
Acheron itself can resist it
embrace

so what say you
will you be the
lucky one or will you tell i who
be

do you know of Acheron

tall tale
mean to scare

history
Acheron be an empire that
swallowed all of Hyboria lead by
the king and he legion of demon
warrior
unstoppable
insatiable
immortal
but still it have one
weakness
for the true power of
Acheron laid not with it king but
the queen
every twenty year a
new queen from the royal line would
be coronated with a crown of iron
spike would pierce she slowly
drain she precious blood and
through she suffer Acheron would
remain invincible
until one of i
ancestor an Acheronian himself
put a stop to this tyranny
he and
other spirit the new queen away
hide she from the empire and all
those who would raise it again

what care i for queen and empire


do not you hear i
this evil face
we all
all of civilization will
fall if the army of Acheron be
raised again

i hear
only i would happily put
all of you civilization to the
torch myself

but you owe i a debt you
thankless oaf

i only debt be to i people
and
it still lie unpaid

it be a pirate ship
they left as
soon as the girl and the large one
board

which way do they sail

north

be you certain

yes please i be telling you the
truth


send word to Ukafa
they come to
he by sea

find i a warship


try not to taste it going down
would be i advice

you have known conan long

we sail with he for a while
i
would like to say i know the man

he be a riddle to i

aye he be that too

we have the same goal
why will he
not trust i

why would he
he be a stranger in
every land he trods
man with no
home no people none but the
company of ghost
and he bear the
weight of they death every moment
of every day

that be no way to live


he do not live
i have see in he
great mirth only to watch it
smother by great melancholy
he
owe a blood debt and he can
entertain no other joy no other
because until it be fulfilled

and yet you call he friend and
risk death to help he

let i tell you something of conan
he will never lie
he will never
break a trust once given
and he
will never ever give up

he be a stubborn ass

he be that lass
he be that


here we stand again
will the queen
reveal herself or must another
innocent suffer

i father he tire of you
charade
he grow impatient
but i
have no such haste
i enjoy
watch you squirm


perhaps you would like to see the end
you sister faced back at the
monastery


no
you fear be not enough yet
let we try hard

i have read all there be to know of
mighty Acheron
why would true
Acheronians protect a traitor to
they own
you once held the entire
world in you grasp now you hide
and cower like pitiful mouse

and mouse be mean to be swallowed
whole

what be in the box could only
drink from you one at a time
but
the beast of Acheron it will claim
four of you this night


who will spare the rest and tell i
which of you be the queen



i be here swine

i be the one you seek

at last
some bravery
but of
course you would not expect i to
take you word would you

you vengeance then what
you will
be free from you ghost
what of
you future conan

people as i should have

so you life be penance
for what
for live
and when you too die
what do you believe happen then

nothing

nothing
i could not live without
some kind of belief in the world
after this

i believe in the cold of steel the
warmth of flesh
all else be fairy
tale


perhaps
but i still die with faith
in i heart belief in something
great than one self
what will
you die with

purpose
i die with purpose



to station
to station



what do you think
they have we
outnumber but we might beat
they speed


that be what they wish
they drive
we to another force approaching
from the south

then we fight

no
we give they what they think
they want
about ship
now


they be turning to run

good
we only need stay close


and now

cimmerian

but know Khalars pig son will soon
share you fate

now finally you die


time to go


i could get you close
another
half day along the coast

i need you head west to draw off
we pursuer
i will find another
path to khor Kalba

so be it
swift wind at you back

so you be taking i with you to
khor Kalba

i never said that
but i will not
leave a virgin onboard a pirate
ship alone

i but who said i be a
virgin

we will rest here until morning


will i awake alone
do you intend
to leave i

i would do you a kindness
khor
Kalba will bring only death

please conan
artus told i of how
you lost you tribe
i too have to
watch as i people be taken from
i

all i ask be that you let i travel
with you
i too have a purpose
i
must get to the queen
i would
rather you kill i here than fail
she again

i be wrong about you
you be no
fearless warrior
you heart be
closed to all but fear and hate

we leave at dawn
i will not break
stride for you
not once
i will
get you into khor Kalba
beyond
that i have i purpose and you
yours

nice fire
do it mean you will
actually cook the meat this time



the pirate ship sail to the west
even under full sail it will be no
easy task to overtake she

Fariq have do well
head east back to khor Kalba

but we chase point the other way

the chase be over
they come to i
now




what be the woman of you tribe
like conan

they fight beside the man

so they be equal
and you
mother

she die in battle even as i be
born

so you never know she
it be the
same with i
i have always known
be a mother be somehow not i
fate
but

you said early khor Kalba will
bring only death
be you trying
to scare i or do you really
believe we end lie there

i do not lie

then we do not have much time
you
mother perished too young but at
least she die have known the
touch of one who care

so do you care conan




i have only ever hear you speak of
what you would die for conan
what
would you live for

do you ever tire of talking
let i
rest woman

i think that may work

i see you clearly now finally
after all this time
i would be that which you live for
conan if you would have i
you
may have faith in nothing conan
but i have faith in you




we will slip in along with those
trader
but you will need a change
of clothes those monk robe will
draw attention

what will i wear


i do not understand why i could not
be dressed as you be
i look like
a whore

and what good disguise for a
monk


do not test i beast

be there not a live thing you can
be at peace with



it be probably only way into
Khalars fortress
i be sure it be
heavily guarded at all time day
and night

so we must try to scale the cliff

and dodge arrow as we do so

during the day we would easily be
spotted on the climb
and it would
be useless to even attempt at
night
no we must find another
way






halt

thief
you will regret finding i



i think not

it take longer than you think to
cut this out of lucius stomach
after all that work i figure i would
keep it for old time sake


what
do you wish to join in


so you be right about the
platform
you will be long dead
before you make it top
same with
scaling the cliff
there be no known
way to break into the fortress

so that be it

i do not say that
i just said
there be no known way in because
no one have ever tried to
but
breaking out that be another
story
it be not much easy but
it be possible

you just need to find someone crazy
enough to show you the way

these catacomb run underneath the
entire city even to the cistern
that drain out from the fortress
dungeon

catacomb
you mean sewer

piss and shit be the last thing
you need to worry about down here


what be it

warn
these catacomb be
connected to the sea
it say that
the beast of Acheron protect it
secret

not from i

sorry friend
we stop here
we have
hear too much about what lie
within to go any far

where now

around
up





oh

what

something touched i
something
slimy

crom
stop wasting time

who die first





crom

you will make a nice meal



where be Ilira

she be taken away by Fariq

then i be too late

no
she be just taken this
morning
it be not yet midnight
and Khalar still must bring she to
the cave of Acheron

you be going to fight Khalars
troop
just you

Cimmerians be not the only woman
who know how to fight
and to kill

we duty be to keep the queen
safe
we failed
but if Khalar
bring she to Acheron it will rise
again and all we people
sacrifice be for nothing


so if the queen be not free by the
stroke of midnight she must be
already dead

you want i help again

no
you keep you word i will keep
mine
i pray you fulfill you debt

guard

do not kill he
we need to find out
which way Ilira be taken

tell we where the last girl be
taken



let i ask

you debt


will be where you queen be

Ilira

she be dead
it be over



not yet

it be only begin
because that one
be not the heir to Acheron

she be

no
it can not be

secretive the traitor of Acheron
it be not easy but Fariq finally
wrung honesty from the girl
that
poor innocent be forced to live a
lie even as the truth be keep
from the queen herself


and you do the rest barbarian

be hour you have make i wait for
i fun

you make i lose face in front of
i father
that be not wise
but
what should i expect from a
cimmerian

swift end

but that be a difference
between you and i

sense of balance do not you think

of Acheron be crown and the
queen be sacrifice

be a queen giving birth to an
empire
