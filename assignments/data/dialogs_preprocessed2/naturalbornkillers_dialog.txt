i could say the same thing about you
i want to thank you very much for
seeing i

i have a television show
it be very
popular
every week we do a profile on
a different serial killer
you do not

manson beat you

yeah it be pretty hard to beat the
king

we have be waiting to do a follow up
episode on you for a long time
and
that time have definitely come
i feel it be apparent to anyone who be
hip to what be going on that the prison
board have throw the constitution
straight out the fuckin window
you and mallory may be killer but
you be not insane
you belong in a
prison not in an asylum
the prison
board be blatantly railroad you into
a hospital for the sole purpose of
turning you into vegetable
now some
people be saying so what
i be not
one of those people
if we avert we
eye while they do this to you we give
they permission to do it again whenever
they see fit
today they wipe clean
you mind because they feel you
action be dangerous tomorrow they
wipe clean i mind because they feel
what i say be dangerous
where do
it all stop

i problem mickey be that you do not
exactly inspire empathy
i be all alone
on this
i need you help
i want
what the prison board be do to be
the focus of we follow up episode
now i have interview with chairman of
the prison board Dewight mcclusky about
this issue
and i be tellina ya
mickey he look bad
the two
psychologist they used for they
psychiatric kangaroo court will not talk
to we which always look bad
i have
an interview with both the judge of
you trial bert Steinsma and the
psychologist and author emil
Reinghold both of which discount the
notion that you be insane
you put
that all together and what the state
be doing become obvious
but the
network be not satisfy
they feel the
show need another element
it need
you
in order to put the show on the
air i need to get an interview with
you
you have not talk to the press
since you trial
now a few day
before you get transferred to an
asylum you grant an interview on
television with wayne gayle
we be
talkin a media event here
every son
of a bitch out the with a set
going to tune in to see that
we will make they motive so blatant
we will shame they into dropping the whole
thing
at least for a little while
the publicity would keep they from just
giving you and mallory lobotomies
well whatta you say

have you talk to mallory about this

she will not even see i mickey
now
you be not suppose to know anything
about what be going on with she but i be
going to tell you something
since you
two be sentence mallory have not
spoken one word

she do not talk

not to anybody
she sing

she sing
what do she sing

song
he be rebel leader of the
pack town without pity that dusty
springfield song i only want to be
with you
that be what i hear anyway
she behaviour be the main thing the
doctor report used against you
so
even if she would see i which she
will not i could not put she on camera
anyway
if i ask she mallory be
you insane
and she start singing
dead skunk in the middle of the road
that blow we whole case



time motherfucker

wait a minute mickey i need an
answer

just think about it
but do not think
too long

from behind with you leg draped over
mine and you arm wrapped tightly

after taking a few day to reflect on
you offer i have come to the conclusion
that you be one hundred percent
correct
national interview would
be very advantageous to both mallory
and i
the only obstacle be they be
shipping i out to the funny farm in
four day
however that be you
problem and not mine
i feel confident
you will manage
here to we making
television history
sincerely mickey

this
be the day we received word we be

going to have the first sit down in depth
interview with the most charismatic
serial killer ever one day before he be

they be shippin mallory
that be when
we do the mickey knox interview because
the next day he go

would the network really not run it
without the interview

be you kidding
the last thing they
expected be mickey knox to get up
close and personal
they wanted a
follow up episode and would have taken
anything i have given they
i be not
going to tell mickey knox that
i be going to
make he think he grey matter depend
on it
when i told woody and the brass
about this coup they practically shit
a brick
i be talkin an adobe brick
they want to expand the show to a hour
and they want it on immediately

how immediate be immediately

next week episode

we do not get enough footage for a hour
follow up

what he said

rape and pillage the first episode
just change the order a bit
those
son of bitch out there be not going to
know the difference
all that shit be
just filler for the interview anyway
we film a new intro
show some old
footage from the first episode so the
get a brief history of mickey and
mallory
we introduce a new angle
what the prison board be up to
we
see some of that new shit then the
rest of the show be the interview
now
what be so fuckin hard about that
oh
julie make a note
i need woody to get
i thirty second of the live at five
broadcast to promote next week show
we will do a feed right from the jail
while we be wrapping up with mickey

millimetre black and white and i mean
black and white where the black
black and the white white
this be

so unruly july comino with i and
planning the interview
you two go down to the edit bay
take the old footage and the new
footage put it together and see what
we get

at that point i will ask he if he
believe in god
if he say yes i will
ask he what he think god would make
of he action
and be he worry
about burning in hell
if he say no
i will say well mickey what do you
believe in
and hopefully he will say
something like a live round of ammo
the expression on the face of a man he
just split up the middle mallory
eye sex drug and rock n roll
he be bound to say something
provocative

okay boy let we have it

well basically what we do be put
part of the old show on first

but we changed the order around so it
be not super obvious

then we added the new shit to the
tail

so we film the interview and we can
just slap it on at the end

okay let we see it



now we get to film a new intro for the
follow up episode
but we put the
intro for the first episode at the
beginning temporarily so you can see it
with some scope



i hear you
play


hello
welcome to american maniac
i be you host wayne gayle
and this be
highway

to some the fast distance between
point and point
to other a
beautiful stretch to the american
landscape
but to mickey and mallory
knox it be a candy land of murder and
mayhem



after living a very routine drab
nothing outoftheordinaryever
happen kind of life the sweetheart
shocked the entire nation with a
crosscountry crime and murder spree
that last only three week but
left



fortyeight known body in it
wake
including



mallorys very own parent



they start they crime wave in los
angeles

and they be finally apprehend here
at this circle in st
paul
minnesota





they start off rob type
store and gas station and later
graduated to bank and the big time

mickey and mallorys idea of an arm
robbery be a little different than
most
it be an assault actually

well
i know that mickey and mallory
kill everybody when they be through
except for one clerk
there be a
couple of people in the store then and
i be working with stevo
and i like
stevo you know
but i be think
what could i do to make they pick i to
be the clerk that get to live

money
money
money
fast
fast
fast
fast
fast than that



they would storm in with shotgun and kill
every customer in the place right off
the bat


sick be not it
after killing numerous people the
would always leave one clerk alive
one clerk
to give they the money
and tell the tale of



mickey and mallory



patrolman gerald nash be just one of
the twelve peace officer that mickey
and mallory murdered during they reign
of terror



gerald and he partner dale wrigley
be park at



this donut shop Alfies donuts
when

this cadillac coupe de ville pulled
up about three space away
gerald
come walking out with we coffee
and
i bear claw
when the driver of the
car ask he something gerald start
giving he what look like street
direction
when he finished the
driver wave he thank bring up a
shotgun and

apparently bore with banditry and
murder the two outlaw prove what
renaissance psychopath they really
be
to break up the monotony in
between bank job or what have you
they start butcher whole
household at random

unfortunately the story do not end
with they capture
it just become
more surreal
they subsequent trial
turn into a sick circus




as spectator reporter law
student tourist gawker the
interest the curious the devote
and the demented be draw to the los
angeles county courthouse like moth to
a flame

the mickey and mallory knox murder
trial be so event filled it make the
crime spree that take place before pale
by comparison
the first point be the
decision of mickeys to act as he own
council
now this in itself be not
unheard of for instance ted bundy
act as he own council as well
what
be unexpected be how well mickeys
performance would be



we speak with burt Steinsma who be
the preside judge during the knox
trial

mickey be surprisingly effective
when i be tell i be to be the judge
of this trial and then i be tell
mickey knox would be handling he own
defence i get a headache that last
five day
but at first i breathe a
sigh of relief
mickey show up very
prepared and prove to be an excellent
amateur lawyer



however this opinion be not shared by
the state prosecutor on this case
wanda Bisbing

judge Steinsma said that mickey show
up very prepare and prove to be an
excellent amateur attorney

oh that be rich
well consider
that mickey knox turn he court into
a mockery and personally make he look
like a fool i would say that be very
benevolent of judge Steinsma
as far
as mickey be an excellent amateur
lawyer maybe i be old fashion but
when i go to law school we be
taught the object be to win the case
which i do

the nation caught fire to mickey and
mallory fever mickey and mallory
mania if you will as the merit to
mickeys talent as a defence attorney
become apparent
law student from all end of the
country converge on los angeles as
legal history take a new course
but
that be only the lemon next to the
pie
and that pie be you the american
people
that pie be the way the
strangely charismatic and make no
mistake they be charismatic mickey
and mallory have capture the public
interest fear and in some case
admiration


what do you think of mickey and
mallory

hot

hot

totally hot

mickey and mallorys the good thing to
happen to mass murder since manson

Fortyeight people known
they be way
cool than manson

what do you think of mickey and
mallory

well he be just
i dunno
charismatic

they be so romantic

i be here to watch the judge give those
two shit ass the stiff
sentence the law allow
i want to see
they face when the state say they
be the bad scum sucking degenerate
douche bag filthy i do not know what be

courtroom trial rival dare i say

face
it be i anticipation

you be talking about a man and a woman
who killed innocent people

do not get we wrong

we respect human life an all

but

to catch mickeys eye


what do you think of mickey and
mallory

i admire they

i do too

but how can you say that

and a snakeeye glare

and a snakeeye glare arnold be
able to totally psyche out any
confidence Ferigno have

he squash he mentally before
physically defeating he

he have the edge
the mind edge

mickey and mallory have that edge

only on a much grand scale

they have hypnotized the nation

Schwartzenegger be the king of the
edge before they come along

you say this and yet
you two be
both victim of mickey and mallory

yes

yes

how can you say that you admire they

it be like this wayne
two people be
standing in a dark room waiting for the
other to attack
these two people
can not see each other yet they know
they be there
now they can either
stand in the dark room forever waiting
until they die of boredom or one of
they can make the first move

why can not they just shake hand and be
friend

they can not because neither know if the
other be a derange senseless killer
like the Knoxs
so you may as well
make the first move

and they make the first move

unfortunately yes

but you see that be okay wayne

why

they passed the edge along to we

how so

by taking away we leg
now we have
to fight hard to get ahead than
anyone else you will find in this gym
probably the whole city
they give we
the fight spirit
before this
happen i be content
now i be piss
off
now i be half a man and i have get
to work like the devil to get whole
again

but you will never be whole again

never be a very long time wayne

word only the weak use
i be not a sore
loser
even if i do not have a leg to
stand on i be going to get up and fight
this world until i be on top again

that be the mickey and mallory way

that be the way of the world

they be shocking the world into
remembering the primal law

survival of the fit

one last question
usually mickey and
mallory kill all of they victim
why
do they let you two survive

they have we tied down during one of
they house raid you have see the
headline and they be taking a
chainsaw to we leg before they be
going to kill we

just for fun i guess

and then mallory stop mickey and say
hey these be the brother hun


mickey stop sawin on i leg and say
oh i god i be you big fan


apparently they have see all we film

they be especially influence by
conquering huns of neptune


so mallory call and they take
off

they actually apologize

the couple prove so popular that a
motion picture glamorize they
exploit be make



the movie thrill killer prove to be
a tremendous box office success making
star out of the before then unknown



actor jessie alexander warwick and
buffy st
mcqueen

together they be the thrill killer
the true story of the couple that
shocked the world



with a bloodlust of violence



and unbridled passion

when society catch up with you i would
hate to be in you boot

let i telly ya about society and it
boot
it use those boot for
steppin on people like i and she




we talk with neil pope writer and
director of thrill killer for he
take on the mickey and mallory
phenomenon

it be i belief that mickey and mallory
knox be a cultural phenomenon that
could only exist in we sexually
repress society
flower that could
only bloom amidst a grotesque fast food
culture
what i tried to do with
thrill killer be trace the root of
the problem all the way down the vine
to the original bad seed
yet amidst
the violence and murder and carnage
you have get the structure of a wagnerian
love story

mickey honey listen to i

i can not go
i be too fucked up

i be not saying it be not going to hurt
but

i can not run with you mickey
i really
want to
if i could i would but i
can not
i get to stay here
but you can
still get out of here

no fuckin way
no fuckin way

if they stay they will catch you and
they do not have to catch you

no fuckin way

mickey you be wasting time

states marine all whistling the hall
of montezuma be going to come marchin

mickey i love if you leave i

mallory i angel if i could of left

well hell if you will not leave give i
a gun so i can go out shooting

sit tight
i be going to make it a little
tough for they

time to get naked and boogie

mickey

yeah baby

you make every day like kindergarten

mallory




why do you kill mallory
both of
they be still alive

it be dramatic license no doubt
but
i feel an operatic love story needed an
operatic end
the two of they kill
for each other
they offer the death
of they victim to each other like
other lover offer flower or bon bon
so what more natural what more
organic what more poetic than mallory
offering she death to mickey
it be
where it be be leading since day one
we worked it in the movie by use a
what if they escaped situation
i
think it work beautifully
you would be
surprise
people come up to i at the
end of the movie in tear

one thing about mickey for sure he be
definitely a man who have he moment
it be wild playin he
it be one of
those getitoutofyoursystem
performance

i do not play mallory the murderer
i
do not play she as a butcher
i play
she as a woman in love who also
happen to murder people
i do not
want she to be at arm length from the
audience or myself
if you play she as
this wild maniac the audience never
have to deal with she
if you see a
decapitation in a movie you just say
oh wow a neat special effect

because you can not relate to a
decapitation
it do not mean anything
to anybody because it be not personal
Decapitations do not fall into most
people realm of life experience
but if you show somebody in a movie
get a paper cut the whole audience
squirm
because everybody can relate
to a paper cut



do you meet the real mallory knox

i tried to but she would not see i
but i read some letter she write to
mickey before the murder spree
they
helped i out a lot


you meet mickey knox do not you

yeah i visit he when he be up in
Susanville
he be a little cerebral for
i taste but all in all we get along



to get a psychiatric view on the
strange attraction mickey and mallory
seem to have we talk with doctor
emil Reinghold noted psychologist and
author

can you she would some light doctor
Reinghold on why the public have taken
a pair of sociopath so close to they
bosom


well for one the media have do a
tremendous job of turning the husband
and wife mass murderer into
celebrity
but it be the country
youth who have turn the couple into
the ultimate antiheroes
basically
the very thing that make they most
lethal be the exact same thing that
capture the public heart and
mind mickey and mallorys operatic
devotion to each other
in a world
where people can not seem to make the
simple relationship work and the
slight emotional commitment be
considered devastate mick and
mallory have a doordie romance of a
shakespearean magnitude
to the
country youth percent of which
be coming from break home that be
appeal
they have an we against
the world posture which always appeal
to youth
and they have taken that
posture seventeen step beyond
it be not we against the world it be
we be going to kill the world
they be
exciting
i read they file and i find
myself turning the page like it be a
paperback
why do disillusion youth
get into mickey and mallory
why do
disillusion housewife read romance
novel
why be you film this
special
because you know as well as i
do you say tonight at nine charles
manson speak everybody going to
tune in to hear what he say
mickey
and mallory have shocked a country numb
with violence
they have created a world
where only two exist and anybody who
inadvertently enter that world be
murdered



this attitude from the young towards
they ultimate antiheroes be nation
wide
and spreading

you take all the great figure from the
states
elvis jack Keroac
Bukowski james dean jim morrison
angela davis jack nicholson jim
thompson martin scorcese
add a
bloody pale of nitro and you get mickey
and mallory
they be like rebel
without a because except they have a
because
only nobody know what it be

they because be each utter



keep the faith mickey and mallory
keep the faith



mickey and mallory have a love that be





they be super cool

and as to almost give this whole
misplace admiration scenario a cherry
on the top the rock band redd kross
enter the chart last week at number
with they song natural born
killer the saga of mickey and
mallory


the third wicked twist to this story be
grace mulberry




of the six teen murdered that night
seventeen year old grace mulberry be
the lucky one left to tell the tale
and this haunt young lady summon up
the courage to take the stand tell
what she see that horrible night and
then allow herself to be crossexamined
by the man who killed she brother and
girlfriend

miss mulberry
how do it feel to be
the only survivor of mickey and
mallorys reign of terror

miss mulberry
have the experience
marked you

do you watch you brother get stabbed
up

how do you feel about mickey cross
examining you



mickey and mallory

mickey how do you feel about cross
examining grace mulberry

i be keen with anticipation

what do you think of this turn out
mallory

i be not never have so much fun

do you have any regret

not a one

yeah i always regret we never get
around to looking up i old history
teacher miss bainbridge
now there be
a big bad bitch not good for herself or
nobody

what be you favorite pastime

you mean aside from what i be be
tried for

oh i would say watch

what be you favorite show

have gun will travel


do you have anything to say to you
fan

you be not see nothing yet


no apparently we have not see
everything
grace mulberry give she
tearful testimony
then it become
mickey Knoxs turn for cross
examination




grace be terrify of mickey
you
have to understand most of they
victim be normal people with normal
life that nothing out of the ordinary
ever happen to



then out of the blue they be dealing
with the devil incarnate
it be
extremely difficult for we to find
survivor who would take the stand and
testify when they know mickey would be
crossexamining they



grace be every bit as terrify every
bit as haunted
but she feel she
brother tim and she five girlfriend
be counting on she




no **further/far question you honor



would you care to cross examine the
witness mr
knox


as a matter of fact you honor i
would

that be one helluva story miss
mulberry

yes it be

grace
i hope you do not mind if i
call you grace

grace
i would like to talk to you about
you late brother tim if you feel up
to it


grace
i hope you do not mind if i
call you grace

naw she do not mind

grace
i would like to talk to you about
you murder brother tim if you feel
up to it




do you get along

miss mulberry

more or less

more or less

what do you mean by that

well he be i old brother
when we
be growing up there be times we
could of very well do without each
other
but when it count we be
close

i would like to talk about tims martial
art ability
how long have he be
study

he start when he be in the seventh
grade so that would make it nine
year



when you study the martial art they
give out belt that come in different
color to signify what level you be at
in you train
be i correct on that
point

yes you be

what be the color of tims belt

the style of fighting that tim studied
do not believe in belt

be that a fact
well then grace
could you tell we what form of martial
art it be that tim be school in

tim studied several style but he
favorite be jeet kune do

jeet kune do
now i do some research
on that form of fight and i find
out that jeet kune do be a style
developed by bruce lee
do you know
that

yes i do
that be why tim studied it
because it be bruce lees fight
style

now while i freely admit total
ignorance on the subject i have hear
of bruce lee
and i be under the
impression that bruce lee be one of
the if not
the
great fighter in the
history of martial art

that be what tim said

so i think it would be safe to say
that anybody who studied the fight
style that bruce lee arguably the
great martial artist of all time
developed for nine year that would be
a fella who could defend himself
would you describe tim that way grace

yes i would

point of fact be not tims hand
registered as lethal weapon

yes they be

that mean he hand be considered a
weapon like a gun or a knife
be i
correct on that point

yes you be

yet in you testimony just now you
described that tim



kick i four time in the head



and he train martial artist kick
have little to no effect



then after shrug off four blow to
the head like i be superman i lift
TimnineyearsofJeetKuneDoMulberry
off the ground and threw he across the
room



then i take

this knife and proceed to tear he
limb from limb
and this man whose
hand be lethal weapon

objection defence be intimidating the
witness with the murder weapon



sustained
mr
knox put the knife
down

have little to no defence

i do not know how you do it but you
do it

mr
knox
the knife

how do you think a human being could
possibly be capable of do something
like that

i do not know

now
i do not believe that grace
i
think you have a definite opinion on
how i be able to do those thing you
described
now i be going to ask you
again
and i want you to remember you
be under oath



in you opinion miss mulberry how be
i able to murder you brother tim
mulberry in the manner you described

you be not human

i think about it a lot
and the only
thing i could figure be that you be not
human

you be a vampire or the devil or a
monster or cyborg or something like
that
but you be not human

thank you
grace there be one other
thing

what

you be right

show off

no **further/far question you honor

light out prick




after the deadly brewhaha in the
courtroom the judge honorable burt
Steinsma passed down a sentence that
be to make legal history



we speak with retire judge Steinsma at
he home in baltimore maryland

be there any vengeance on you part
with you unique sentence

yes unquestionably
after they do
what they do in i court and judge
worth he robe will tell you the same
thing
it could not help but affect i
decision
that be why they have judge
we be suppose to be fair to a fault
but when it be showtime we have to make
a decision
that be why we do not just
input all the fact into a computer for
the appropriate punishment
i could not
give they the death penalty
see
california hop back and forth on that
issue
mickey and mallory go to
court when it be out of favor which
be actually good because it leaf more
room for imagination
anybody can give
somebody the chair
when you have
someone who deserve to die and you
can not kill they you have to be
creative
and if the bastard have let
it stand it would of be the perfect
sentence
it hit they right where they
live
far more punish than the
death sentence

would you please describe for we
viewer what you sentence be

well in a rogue gallery of killer
mickey and mallory be very unique
i have see a lot of killer in i day
and they be a very cold lot
they have
no more feeling about taking a
persona life than squash a tiny
bug
it be all the same to they
well
mickey and mallory be that kill they
to watch they expression change
attitude personify
except with each
other
and since they live only for
each other i wanted to attack that at
it very root
so in a nutshell i
sentence be double life for each
without any possibility for parole
that would be fairly standard in they
case
the twist i added be that the
husband and wife would have no contact
or correspondence with each other for
the rest of they live
and they
would never receive any word or
information about the other
so basically once the cell door slam
shut mickey and mallory will
completely disappear from each other
life
they will never know when the
other die
but alas the good laid
plan of mouse and man





the sentence be never to reach that
point
because after only a year
mickey and mallory created so much
mayhem that it be decided



that they be mentally i will and
needed to be transferred to a state
mental hospital




we talk with Dewight mcclusky
chairman of the california state prison
board about this curious turn of
event in the mickey and mallory case

why be mickey and mallory be moved
to an asylum
and who make the
decision

the prison board make the decision

board of which i belong
we be the
who
the why be simple
mickey and
mallory be mentally i will and need to be
under a doctor care where hopefully
they will receive the help they need

mickey and mallory be deem
competent in a mental examination
before they trial
i be confuse
what be changed

well since that time they have killed
one person during they trail
and
since they incarceration they have
killed one psychologist along with
several guard and inmate

when they be find competent before
they have already killed fifty people
other than the fact they be a
disciplinary problem which frankly
should not surprise anyone i still
do not see where this situation be any
different then it be before
so i
ask you again mr
mcclusky what be
changed

what be changed mr
gayle be we
mind
we feel they be competent a
year ago
year have passed sir a
year where they be under close
observation day in and day out and
they behaviour have lead we to believe we
be wrong

who be we

the prison board and the doctor who
examine they

be any of the doctor who make the
first evaluation on the Knoxs mental
state ask to reexamine they

use the same doctor be not common
practice

i take it by you answer it be a whole
new team

now that you bring it up yes
they
be different man
i have not really
think that much about it
since many
psychiatric opinion be by a rule
sought out for this kind of situation
what do you think normally happen
the Knoxs be assign a family
psychologist that take care of they
throughout the rest of they live
the state do not work like that



the two psychiatric opinion the board
sought be those of albert
rodriguez



and dr
felix Vargus
both of the
good doctor for whatever reason
refuse to be interview


it be a funny situation actually
if
anyone besides mickey and mallory give
a damn what the prison board be do
would be considered an outrage
the
prison board be basically saying we
can not handle these guy
they have
moved they around twice since they
sentence start
they be a handful everywhere they
go
now the prison they be at now
want they outta there
but no other
prison going to be stupid enough to take
they
so the prison board be left
scratching they head wonder what
they be going to do
well what they
decided to do be to set up a kangaroo
medical court that find they crazy
then they get they transferred to
Nystrom medical asylum or lobotomy bay
as it be referred to in the psychiatric
circle
put they on a strict dope and
electro shock diet and mickey and
mallory cease to be a problem to
anybody except the orderly who clean
out the bedpan which if you want to
see they get theirs that be all well
and good
but there be something be
said here
forget the immorality for a
second
forget the corruption and the
skulduggery involved
what the board
be saying be we give up
mickey and
mallory run amuck in polite society
they be put in an alternative society
and they run amuck there too
all the
power that be can not deal with these
two kid
and whatever can not be
assimilated have to be terminated

so in you opinion mickey and mallory
be not insane


insane no
psychotic yes
menace
to living creature yes
but to
suggest that they be insane give the
impression that they do not know right
from wrong
mickey and mallory know
the difference between right and wrong
they just do not give a damn

good work i brother
Fanfuckin
tastic
i think that interview stuff

what would i do
i and i network

sheriff department for flagrantly
disregard i safety
i would go
straight to i buddy the mayor and
make sure everyone of those son of a
bitch down there end up on the
unemployment line
in fact i would sue
every man down there personally
i
would make it i life ambition to
bring the county jail to it knee
i would do expose after expose on the
brutality and the condition and the
inhumanity that exist here

that be what i think
you tell they
that

want you to scream what you just told

this be wayne gayle
i be wound and
i crew roger and scott be dead
this may be out of sync because we be
shooting with a wild camera and a
standard recorder we find in the van
mickey Knoxs plan worked
we walk
out the front door into i news van
and make we getaway
when we be
follow by patrol car mallory knox
killed deputy sheriff duncan Homolka
and toss he body out of the back
mickey told authority over i police
band that i would surely be next if
they do not give up the pursuit
they
take mickey at he word and called off
the pursuit
why helicopter be not
employed i do not know

thought be it all happen too fast for
arrangement to be make
we have just
pulled off to the side of the road to
do this interview
tension run high



we be not get all fuckin day

without any far ado mickey and
mallory

mallory what do you think of mickeys
plan
do you think it would work

it be not until we get on the ground
floor that i totally realized they
be not going to shoot unless we shoot
first
when we get out of the
stairwell i remember think oh i
god
this might work
but
mickey know it would work all along
there be not any doubt in he mind
it be not like there be and he just
do not show it
he know it would work



what do you think then

i wonder how long it would be before
we would get to be alone together
and i
wonder if i could wait that long

riot in the laundry room

have not you be listening to a fuckin
word i said

oh i be sorry

thing let they
