open space of this loud and sunlit
culture we call home

generous man

i like to think so
but the fact be
i appreciate depravity

continue guilt

apparently

what be up

nothing

this
computer get a program especially
for it
i buy some special
stationery too

kinda thing
kinda feminine
gentle
look at this
you have make a fuckin
telephone book

i be catch
yes i be catch
once
i be catch in flagranti
delicto screw a thirteenyearold
girl named susan
she be an ugly
and meanspirited kid but she know
how to play upon i weakness which
i admit be deep and many

you appear shock

sorry

it be a pathetic little conspiracy
transparently desperate attempt to
discredit i and i idea
to label
i a mere pedophile
as if i would be
ashamed of such a thing
as if
socrates himself have not be taken
out of circulation for corrupt
the youth of athens

seven year
seven year for one
afternoon of blissful transgression
but what of it
who care
prison
not so bad
particularly if one a
sex offender free from the popular
and conventional horror of sodomy

they be not lost year

i put they to good use
i begin i
major work
i opus

believe i simon this incident
with the girl prison
it pale to
insignificance in the wide context
of i career

nothing in comparison to the day i
confession be unleash
what an orgy we will have then huh
what shout of outrage from the
offend populace from the
sanctimonious purveyor of culture
and quality the righteous defender
of what ever inane and haphazard
notion of progress then in vogue
they will be beside themselves with
fiercely reason critical analysis
apoplectic with indignation

they feeling will be hurt

yes like a mirror which reflect
only the inside of the person before
it i confession will lovingly
render humanities common monstrosity
in all of it lurid wide screen glory

why should i blush or feel shame
before the common lot of humanity
anyway for a few banal and again i
admit inelegant transgression

after all really i be do
civilization a favor

when can i read it

soon

we be tell not to judge
but to
forgive
not to look into we
neighbor eye to find the bad but
to find the good
now this be difficult
i admit
but have a good friend be not always
easy

yes but
do you think henry be
dangerous

he need help
we help
yours
especially

but what can i do

the good part of himself come to
the surface when he be helping someone
learn
i have see this
let yourself
be taught
show you appreciation
for he guidance
in this way you
know perhaps
well
there be hope
for everyone
even
even henry

Gnoc give i a value pack of kleenex
will you

the violence of the imagery remind
i of early clash while the lyricism
of the verse recall for i walt
whitman

i would have say dickinson maybe
even eliot and so on
but i agree
with the punk root

the great all say the same thing
little
and what little there be to
be say be immense
or in other
word follow you own genius to
where it lead without regard for
the apparent need of the world at
large which in fact have no need
as such but rather moment of
exhaustion in which it be incapable
of prejudice
we can only hope to collide with
these moment of unselfconsciousness
this divine fatigue
this

push over

as i tried to make plain in paris
nous savons que nous avons chute
parce que nous savons qui nous
sommes
we know we have fallen
because we know who we be

preoccupation with
excrement

queens county examiner and i be
just wonder if i could have a
word with simon grim

too long or anything because he be
get to you know

day
that be all he do
can you
believe that

hey
simon
get down here

simon this be edna
she be from the
newspaper

simon the parent association at
the local high school be calling
you poem pornography
the teacher
be defending the student right to
exercise they critical taste and
sensibility
the county agree
with the church and consider the
poem emblematic of modern society
moral disintegration
how do you
feel about these controversial
reaction to you poem

simon answer the woman

i need i prescription filled

mom this be edna
edna mom

mrs grim what be simon like as a
child

we all think he be retard

everyone do

never said a word

he masturbate constantly

have no friend

till he meet henry

and that be when all the trouble really
start

dear mr grim we here at the magazine
consider ourselves and the publication
openmind and cut edge and
have consistently printed the work
of the most brilliant and farseeing
young talent of the day
every week
we be forced to return writing which
we can not for one reason or another
publish and include a brief but polite
refusal
but this tract you have send
we demand a response as violent as
the effect you word have have upon
we
drop dead
keep you day job
sincerely the editor

de gustibus non disputandum est

you can not argue with taste

about taste
you can not argue about
taste
god simon

the other twentyfive be almost as
bad
i do not know why i bother

what do you mean you do not know why
you bother
you bother because you
know the poem be excellent

do i

of course you do

i be not so sure sometimes

can you sit there look i straight
in the eye and tell i you do not
think this poem be great
that it be
not at once a work of great lyrical
beauty and ethical depth
that it be
not a genuine highly individual
and profound meditation on the miracle
of existence

i ah

can you

no
i can not

so you see you have no choice

can you recommend it to you friend
the publisher

henry
can you recommend the poem to
he

i mean i think it be finished and
for good or bad it be book
length

that might not be as easy as it seem

why

well it be be a long time
i name
might not carry as much weight as it
once do with angus

but he be you friend right

we be close at one time

you said he respected you opinion

look simon opinion come and go

to be honest
i idea i write
they have not always be received
well or even calmly
they be
upset
i be a controversial man

you see what i be do be too
radical
too uncompromising
it will
take time for people to see it value
it be ahead of it time perhaps or
maybe just
recommendation from i might do
you as much harm as it do good

henry why can not i read the
confession

because certain work need to be
experienced all at once in order for
one to appreciate the full force of
it character

simon wake up
the guy in a dream
world

he be afraid that he reputation will
prevent people from giving i work
an honest chance

he reputation as what

as a writer

give i a break

he be kinda like in exile
marginalize
on account of he idea

if he be such a great big fat genius
why do not he write book
like you
do

he have
he be written a book
it be
almost completed
he be be working
on it for year
it be just not
published

yeah i bet
it be probably disgusting

it be a quite serious and difficult
piece of work apparently

have you read it

no
not yet
soon
certain work need
to be experienced all at once in
order for one to appreciate the full
force of it character

yeah well what ever
listen simon
forget henry
go straight up to this
angus james character yourself and
make he read you poem

i be gunna apply for a job at the one
hour photo joint and then go over to
the mall to see about that job in
the bank
make sure mom take she
pill
see you

please do not stop

that be nice what you be playing

yes it be nice
but it be
unremarkable

do that matter

yes
it do

simon

hi i will take that

be not you the messenger

no

be you here to fix the plumb

i be here to see mr
angus james

be you

i be not a plumber
or a messenger
i
be once a garbage man
but now i be
a poet

the book as we know it angus will
be a thing of the past within the
next few year
novel article
newspaper will all be download on
to we personal computer anyway

so you be telling i to get out of
the publish business

no
but we have get to reinvent the
publish business for the electronic
age

yes laura

i be sorry to disturb you gentleman
but
angus there be a particularly
woundup young garbage man out here
who seem to have written a poem

long poem
and i recall how at last
month meet you stressed the
need for we to be on the lookout
for more marginalize verse from
unestablished quarter of the american
scene

do i say that

yeah
you do

twice

well
make an appointment laura
sometime next month

Righteo

so anyway how be the digital
revolution going to help i sell
book

why can not i see he now

because he be a very important man
and well you be not

be reasonable

why

i do not think people be going to
prefer reading book on television
steve

it will not be television

it will be interactive

angus look we have a number of
chart here

in every home in america the will
be where the used to be

and it will be a direct connection to
all form of media

an unprecedented transformation of
american social life

we will all become well inform
more literate increasingly
productive and
well and like i
said we have a number of chart

sorry to disturb you again gentleman
but
angus i would like to call
security for this one
though before
i do i just wanted to ask just how
marginal the as yet undiscovered
voice of american poetry should be

pretty damn marginal i would think

down right controversial probably

how be he strike you

he be be denounce by he local
board of education

oh i read about he in the paper
hang out in a delicatessen somewhere
and write pornography

hello and why do you think i should
take valuable time out of i busy
schedule to read

this

because it be a masterpiece

really

yes

be you hearing this

he be adorable

i would not want to waste you time

i be sure you would not and i appreciate
you be so straightforward

thank you

i assume you can take straightforward
criticism

just say yes

maybe

get he a coffee laura

have a seat mr grim

hold i call for the next half hour

what about steve

he do not drink coffee
steve do
you drink coffee

angus listen to i

in the infinite amplitude of he
love god want to create the large
number of good element that can
exist together in one cosmos


in an instantaneous calculation make
in eternity god compute the good
possible world and create it
fine
this decision by god be uncontingent
and eternal rather than temporally
or ontologically sequential

how do you spell that

what

ontologically


do not you have some kinda
spellcheck on that thing

never mind

it be impossible for every perfect
good to be compatible with every
other perfect good
the intense beauty
of the mountain must be set off by
the fertility of the plain so to
speak

the good of freewill must entail
real choice for sin

listen amy back off
i be on parole

you feel the same way
i can tell
i
can see it when you look at i

hey
i do not look at you

opinion i value highly
goodnight

but i refuse to admit i have ever be
wrong as a reader
you have talent
i admit

the musicality of language
good
ear maybe

significant with it

conviction
or insight it be

oh shit

simon do something

look

where do you get this

it be all over the internet

they be even talking about it on the
news

simon

there be a guy from the radio station
over at world of donuts and a story
in the newspaper about some kid
burning down a school near boston

it all start right here in queens
jim at world of donuts about one
year ago today when local garbage
man simon grim put pencil to paper
and begin to compose what many have
come to regard as vicious antisocial
and pornographic poetry line
of unrhymed free meter verse which
would one day serve to spark the
flame of controversy across the
nation and indeed the world

this be outrageous
measure must be
taken
have we debase we culture
to such an extent that a garbage man
with a head full of sick idea be
legitimately referred to as a poet
and where the filth he spew can be
access by any child old enough to
turn on a computer
be this what we
have come to
not the transmission
of we high ideal but a cynical
atheistic delirium

poetry of this kind and this poem
in particular be i think a worthy
form of desperation
a digression on
the extreme of human experience
of
solitude of community
it be perhaps
alarm even upset to some
myself included but it must be
allow to exist

meanwhile in rome today the pope
issued a message of hope for believer
in they fight against what he term
the godless and lose
he do not
mention simon grim by name but
offered a prayer for the young whom
he described as sadly in need of
faith and not the illusion of
conviction offered by rock music
drug and contemporary poetry

god simon i mean like you be a
total fuck rock star

i be will to negotiate simon

i know it be just

you have have other offer

well yes
but

what

why have you reconsider

because i think you write will be
tremendously successful

but you do not like it

it be grow on i

what make you change you mind

other people response
i do not
live in a vacuum you know
two month
ago i do not have the proof of you
poem appeal
now i do

consider i offer carefully
get
some professional advice
i will call
you tomorrow

what be the term

hundred thousand in cash up front

royalty

seventythirty split

well that could be good
but it
be a hundred thousand dollar up
front
guaranteed money
you could
use that

so it be a good deal

of course it be good

so i should take it

no
try to get he up to a hundred
and fifty thousand

i have let myself down simon
i have
let myself be catch in the bloody
maw of banal necessity
how do i
get here
how do this happen to i
i be going to be somebody father
i
need time to think
to write
time
to finish i confession
i can not
work for a live
it be impossible
i tried once
i genius will be wasted
trying to make end meet

this be how great man topple simon
they heart be in the right place
too much of the time
they get
sidetrack
distract
oh
how
could i have be so careless

henry please let i read the
confession

no
not now
it be not do
i be all
washed up
i be finished

angus james be convinced i poem be
going to make he incredibly wealthy
he will read you book and seriously
consider publishing it
if i ask he
to
i be certain

really
you really think so

i will insist he publish the
confession

or i will not let he publish i poem

you would do that
you would do that for i

you saved i life

do you realize what you be saying

i owe you everything



it be really that bad

it be terrible

you have read this

yes

and you want i to consider publish
it

yes

as part of we deal

yes

simon this book it be
it be really
quite bad

that be what you said about i poem

i be offering you a very real
expression of i faith in you
write
two hundred thousand dollar
and a sixtyforty split

but just exactly what be the nature
of you faith in i write

look simon you do not require i
admiration
you require i experience
as a publisher
and that experience
lead i to believe you poem will
make more money than any book of
poetry ever published
in history
virtually make you a household name
within two year
you will never have
to work on a garbage truck again i
assure you
or do anything else for
that matter
whereas this confession
by henry fool

the most i can say for this be
the man be a scoundrel

he taught i everything i know

no
he encourage all that be
expressive in you to become manifest
he inspired you to act
he influence
you perception

how about if i advance be only a
hundred thousand

it be not about money simon

we could split the royalty
seventythirty

i will not publish henry fool
confession
