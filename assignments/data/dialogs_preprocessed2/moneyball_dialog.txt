bill james
static shot
desert locker room
empty shower
Cinderblock tunnel light with wireencased lamp like in
a coal mine
watch a game on a

october
we begin to hear disembody cheering crowd and the
faint voice of an announcer

nobody on two and two to saenz who
have just three at bat in the series and
none of they hit as he settle back in

at the end of a tunnel the as empty dugout
the empty
diamond
just a couple of the floodlight be on

rivera look in for the sign he have
it the pitch saenz swing and
the announcer voice and excite crowd abruptly cut
off
in silence we regard the empty seat that
wrap around the play field
but then see that in
fact it be empty seat
there be a lone figure
seated in one of they
the sound snap back on

a ground out to second thom be not
what the as be looking for from saenz
down by two in the ninth
the lone man in the stadium have a radio and a bag of
peanut
he seem at peace as he look down on the empty
diamond a peace only slightly bely perhaps by the
baseball he absently turn in a hand
he switch the
radio back on

eric byrnes have emerge from the dugout
to bat for Menechino


he turn it off again
calmly eat a peanut
wait
switch the radio back on

the as be down to they last strike
and this yankee crowd be on it foot
rivera squint for the sign he have it
deliver and
again at the crucial moment he cut the radio
wait
just a few moment
turn the radio back on

it be bedlam in new york
the yankee
down two game to none have come back
to win three and the division series
the outcome of the series seem to have no effect on
billy
he simply get up switch off the radio and
climb the step to leave
but somehow we still faintly
hear as he come past shuttered concession stand toward
an exit the voice of one of the announcer

this be an exceptional feat not only for
new york thom but for oakland though
not the kind you can be proud of
only
once before have a team lost a division
series after winning the first two game
it be coming from a small television a night security
guard be watch
but when he see billy approaching
he quickly shut it off

it be okay joe you can leave it on
it be no big deal

no it be okay i do not need to watch it
the guard eye consider the baseball billy absently
turn in he hand

how be meg

and the glass window of the bar behind he

the glass but it do not happen

can he hit

he be a tool guy

can he hit

he be get a great swing
natural swing



so you be saying he can not hit

he can hit

the ball explode off he bat

it be exciting
when he hit it sound
like he be droppin a firecracker at his
foot

down in the pisser you can hear that
sound

sound like mays mantle aaron

that be not what i ask
i ask can he
hit

he be a good hitter

if he be a good hitter why do not he hit
good

he need a little work
he will be able to
hit
he could be a great hitter

right
we put he up against big league
competition and suddenly he will be able to
hit

artie who do we like

i like perez
he swing like a man

look he be ready to play the part
he
just need some play time

i be just saying he girlfriend a

billy if you want to talk about another
Giambi this guy could be it

be that a suggestion billy

guy stop
you be talking like this be
business as usual
it be not

we be trying to solve the problem



not like this
you be not even looking
at the problem

we not only have a very clear
understand of the problem we now face
but everyone in this room have face
similar problem countless time before

good
what be the problem

the problem be that we have lost key
player that we now have to replace

uhuh
what be the problem

the problem be the same as it always be
we have get to put a team together with
what we have get

uhuh
what be the problem

we have get home run to replace
rbis double

okay stop
the problem we be trying to
solve be that this be an unfair game
there be rich team poor team foot
of crap and then there be we
and now
we have be gutted
we be organ donor to
the rich
the red sox take we kidney
and the yankee take we heart
and now
i be listening to the same old shit about
have a good body and be a tool guy
like you be looking for fabio
be there
another first baseman like Giambi
be there

then stop looking for one because what
we will surely wind up with be the
mcnuggets version of Giambi


















do not attack the man attack the
argument

i think he just win the argument

what if we have be wrong this whole time
about what ingredient manufacture a win
what if this whole time we think it be
the chicken that make the chicken soup
taste good when really it be the onion
that make the chicken soup taste good
onion be a lot cheap than chicken
you see what i be saying

i do not have the first idea what you be
saying

we get to start over
we get to rethink
this thing
we get to look where other
be not looking

with all due respect we have be do
this for a long time

that do not mean you be do it right
do you watch nature doc
you know what
happen to the runt of the litter
he
die
i be open to any solution as long
as it be not what the other guy be
do
now i be going to cleveland to poach an
outfielder named brandon garcia

hold on you be going to cleveland for
a doubleA guy

billy i have see garcia
he be get a bad
body
it be not a pretty sight

kid wear a large pair of underwear



that be a big boy

he be not just big but kind of doughy

fleshy kind of body

oh you mean like babe ruth

he be no babe ruth

when he walk billy he thigh stick
together
there be enough friction there
to start a bonfire

if you see he i be telling you you
would not want to go to cleveland

billy can i make a suggestion
if you
could get ricardo Rincon
he would be worth
the trip to cleveland

that would solve we left hand reliever
problem

really

yeah

i should get Rincon

definitely

okay
i will also come back with joe
DiMaggio and ty cobb
and who would like
a faberge egg
guy you be not hearing
i in what universe can we afford
Rincon
i be asking you guy to look at this game
differently than you have ever look at it
before
i be going to cleveland



and when i come back i want you to tell
i something i do not already know
i
want to question everything
we have get
to rethink this game
as he exit

and grady
nobody care about a win
season
billy storm out

what be a faberge egg

ball sail well over the head of the in
the outfield who be shag the bat practice fly
the in the park lot have see billy play before
and so know just how far back to stand in order to shag a
ball
BILLYs at the plate crushing pitch from a pitch
machine

he send another one sailing over the head of
the cluster of scout



tan and glisten with sweat look over to
see watch he from behind the backstop
they be looking at he like he be elvis and try to
nonchalant it but can not help a small smile to himself





this be the guy

he be get a great path
i love the
extension in he swing and the backspin
he create

that be some amazing power right there
huh



good approach great balance
how be he
compare to the other around the country

he be number one
let we just hope he be
still there when we pick

this guy go in the first round

the scout put the player through they pace
sprinting field

and be talking to who be
toweling off and be still a little aware of all the
people who be standing nearby to watch the birth of a
star

in there

















the goal should not be to buy player
what you want to buy be win
to buy
win you buy run
you be trying to
replace johnny damon
the red sox look at
johnny damon and they see a star worth
seven point five million a year
when i
look at johnny damon i see an imperfect
understand of where run come from


he bat average be ignorable
what
matter be he on base percentage

which in be

that be
point low than league average and
point low than Garcias

true he steal some base
but attempt
steal in general have to succeed of
the time before they even start to
contribute to run total
in he cost
you run

he be get a good glove
he be a decent
leadoff hitter
he steal base
but he be
not worth the seven point five million
boston be paying he
you be lucky to
have he off you payroll it open all
kind of interesting possibility

you read bill james pete

yes
these idea and this approach to the
game be not all new
in fact some of
they have be around for two decade



if this approach have be around for so
long why be not anybody in baseball do
they

that be a much more difficult question
than how to win baseball game
once you
begin to pull at that string you
understand of the world might begin to
unravel
the elevator door close
Billys in coach stare at the night through the
window lost in thought
Billys mother and father escort martinez and met head
scout roger Jongewaard into the kitchen

billy
they be here

billy
good to see you again
obviously you be a very special player
we would like to compliment you on you high
school career and we be looking forward
to you be a part of the met family
Jongewaard sit at the kitchen table speaking more to
Billys parent than billy himself

there be good and there be premium
you son be premium
he have it all
power speed the arm
the look and
i be never wrong about that
which be why
this be a premium number
he set a contract on the table
clip to it top
sheet be a check
on it lefthand corner be the met
insignia
on the right the amount

they all
see it
lot of money in
silence
then

Billys be offered a scholarship to
stanford



i know
and that be a great
accomplishment
i be sure you be very
proud of he

so he can accept that go there and then

Jongewaard be already shaking he head no

i understand how important college be
i
do
but what i can not do be burn a second
firstround draft pick on someone who
can not play for four year no matter
how good he be
four year be ample time
for someone to get hurt
it happen all
the time
so no
i be sorry
it have to
be one or the other
to postpone four
year be four year he could be in big
league
the sooner he get there the
sooner he can reap the benefit
stanford or the money
young billy regards the check
and then he parent
he really do not know what to do

we be going to give he a different kind
of education
this will not be he life
career it will be he first career
he be
going to be a young guy in the business
world when he baseball career be do
he will still have he whole life ahead of
he

it be you decision billy
whatever you
decide be fine with we
BILLYs looking out he window while holding he cordless
phone
he be dialed the number in and just have to hit the
green button
and now he do

peter ringing cell phone wake he up and he answer
it



hello

it be billy beane

what time be it

i do not care
would you have drafted i
in the first round

what

after i left you run i through you
computer right
would you have drafted
i in the first round

you be a good baseball player

would you have drafted i in the first
round

i would have drafted you in the ninth round
no sign bonus
you would have passed and
go to stanford

pack you suitcase

why

i just buy you from the cleveland
indian
hang up the phone
he sit all alone for a moment

peter pull into the park lot for he first
day of work take in the sight of the colossal concrete
relic that be the oakland coliseum
he be just in time to
see a paint roller on a long pole laying a white stripe
down the middle of jason Giambis giant portrait



peter completely convert the place
the dry erase
board be covered with undecipherable equation
algorithm and number and who be pretty tire now
after not a lot of sleep be in the middle of this
this be what see when he walk into the doorway
where he slow down stop and look around blankly

good evening

good evening

i ask you to do three

yes

to evaluate three available player

yeah

and how many do you do





i do not know why i lie just then

talk i through the wall
get up and give a tour of the dry erase
board

this be the american league west
this
year we be going to need to win between
and game to make the post season
here the number of run we will need to
score in order to win those game and
here the number of run we can allow



































doctor named Semmelweiss show that if
the attending physician and nurse
sterilize they hand before delivery
the mortality rate drop to

and he be vilify

he be institutionalize
for suggest
that wash you hand before putting
they inside someone else body be a
good idea
high function people can
live under the spell of an inexplicable
mental lapse when they think as a group
why be not anybody else do it
because
they do not think guy who look like you
be what win baseball game
they know it
for sure

alright let we find we team

peter schleps he computer stuff
set up plug in
fire up
turn an unused room into a war room with dry
erase board and computer
he install software in the
video room computer work on a computer in he room
print two page of data and review

peter enter and hand the two page to billy
billy
review stand then slowly pace as he read
peter
stand and watch

from somewhere in the outfield we have a wide view of
the darken stadium and Billys office which unlike
the other be illuminated
we can just discern Billys
silhouette as he continue to slowly pace and study



billy and peter walk down a long subterranean corridor
peter carry a laptop and a slim notebook

nervous

no

huh
interesting
peter do not know what to make of that
as they near the scout room billy see
waiting for he outside it

hey art

can i talk to you a second before you get
start

i get a lot to do

i know
whatever it be billy know it can not be as dire as his
other problem but also know that to ignore art would
be to insult he
he gesture for peter to go into the scout room alone
he would rather not but do
the scout assuming perhaps
he be there to make coffee ignore he
he find a place
to sit in a corner

who be the kid

that be peter

i can not manage this team under a oneyear
contract

sure you can



no i can not

i have get to put a team on the field then
i will deal with you contract

how about you deal with the manager
contract and then put a team on the
field

at the moment if a ground ball be hit to
first base nobody going to be there to
stop it from rolling

i have to tell you it be not easy doing
what i do under the cloud of a oneyear
contract

i know
i be there

i know you have
and a year contract
say the same thing to a manager as it
do to a player
there be not a lot of
faith there
which be strange after a
win season

if you lose the last one of the season
nobody give a shit about the other

it be on i now

it be on i art
and the kid the new assistant general
manager

what the fuck be you about to do


and ignore peter who have tried to inconspicuously
plant himself in a corner pull up a chair to receive
he scout report which grady as always will lead
art wander off

how do it go in cleveland

it be cold
the news bother no one

let we get after we relief pitch
problem

we get chad bradford
Righthander
few if any of they have hear of bradford and begin
leaf through they printout and note

submariner

that be the one
technically an
underhander

what be he velocity

unimpressive

about

do he have a good break ball

do not have one

why do you like this guy

well he get people out



the lefthand hitter get a really good
look at he

he be down there
he be down there real
low too

let we move on


well we i think have fare well
we
have some idea for what to do about
Giambi

knock i down

we trade power for speed
rabbit for a
gorilla we go for an overachiever

big heart in the last year he contract
tend to play hard
we usually get a
pretty good year out of they
make up
for some of the offense we lost
or the other option
just a thought
we
go for a highmaintenance guy
guy
that be a little difficult but talented
guy like milton bradley
well not
like milton
milton himself
which do
you want to talk about first

none of they

you be still looking to replace he
you be just saying it another way

we get some trade here

we can not do it
what we can do be
recreate he value to we in the
aggregate



the

Giambis onbase percentage be

Damons be

and Olmedas bless
he heart be

add that up and
you get

you want i to speak

when i point at you yes

Tenninetytwo

divided by three

Threesixtyfour

that be what we be looking for
and
that be what we will find
three player
whose average be

Threesixtyfour

that do not come out right

you get to carry the one

still do not look right

it be right

billy

yes



who be that

that be peter

i do not know how to say this delicately
but do peter need to be here

yes

what be with this on base percentage
obsession
be that bill james bullshit

you can call it billy beane bullshit for
all i care

so here who we want
one

jasons little brother jeremy

he never come home from the game

billy if i may he be have he problem on
the field not to mention he problem
off the field not to mention he be
get a little thick around the middle
there be the stuff with the weed
he be
at strip joint

this guy could start the year with an
agent and end up with a parole officer
for christs sake

he onbase percentage be all we be
looking at now and he get on base an
awful lot for someone who only cost
a year



he can not catch a ball in the outfield
i have see he lose a ball in the
moonlight

david justice

ten year ago he be a big name
he be
going to really help we season ticket
at the begin of the year
but by
june he be not going to be hitting his
weight

he be

he leg be go
he be a defensive
liability
i question whether the bat
speed be still there

Steinbrenner be so pissed at he decline
he be will to eat up half he contract
to get rid of he

that be good

he be a fossil
with all due respect
bringing these three guy aboard be like
putting bubble gum on a flat tire

and why do we want to be the one to bail
justice out of he contract

he get on base

i get free agent who be good than
those guy

scott Hatteberg



who

exactly
sound like an oakland
already
yes he be get a little damage
in he elbow

some damage
he can not throw

we be not interest in he for he arm
anymore than we wanted Giambi for he

wait you be talkin about Hatteberg at
first

yes

he be a career
hitter and the good
part of he career be over

i say it be just starting

well billy you will like the sound of
this
i hear boston want to cut he
and no one want to pick he up

that be good news for we
he be cheap

let i understand this
at first base
you want a guy who be be cut from half
of the minor league team in the country
due to irreparable nerve damage

he can not hit and he can not field but what
can he do
look at the piece of paper or i be going
to point at peter



















some of the scout look over in peters direction no
doubt wonder if he be have something to do with they
general manager idea

billy i just do not see it

that be okay wash
we will not be victimize
by what we see anymore

i understand what you be saying about
they average but there be something
you be forget
none of they play
first base

i have not forgotten that wash
one of
they be going to have to learn

BILLYs at the plate a bat helmet snug around his
head wearing a uniform as a mph fastball buzze
by he and the call

Striiike
step out of the box tap the dirt off he cleat
and step back in
youngerlooking be sitting in field level seat
looking on nervously and trying not to show it
halfswings at the break ball holding he swing
at the last minute


the and both point down to first
base for the call and the make a fist
in the air indicate that billy swing

Striiike
and Billys out
hold she head in she hand and walk back
to the dugout passing a player with on his
back
and now the quick scene of failure become staccato


playing for minor league tidewater and he ground




playing for minor league toledo
he swing and pop
up lamely to the throwing he bat down in
frustration as he jog hopelessly to first and we

billy beane who be quickly
establishing a new record for breaking
bat bat rack and water cooler be
actually a muchtouted first round pick
of the new york met in but the
major have not be kind to he with
only plate appearance in two year
and this will not do anything to help he
as


playing for the minnesota twin where he come back
into the dug out and throw he bat helmet down and





playing for minor league portland and a water
cooler go flying across the dugout and




one of two first round pick in
along with daryl strawberry beane be
bring up last year and send back down
after atbats so here a second chance
as smith deliver
playing for the minnesota twin
he swing hard at
a pitch and strike out and we



playing for the detroit tiger and the bat rack
get heave across the field and




if you be a real baseball fan with a
good memory you might remember that billy
beane be taken in the first round of the
amateur draft back in separated
from allstar outfielder daryl strawberry
by only pick so it just go to
show
in an as uniform
he stand and watch a called
third strike sail past he

strike
billy break the bat over he thigh and drop the piece
on the plate
he begin to walk off



hey billy clean up after yourself
billy hear he but continue to walk off


look up at in the seat behind the dugout
but the two can not quite meet each other eye
in the subterranean video room an even less elegant
place than the rest of the stadium someone have put up a
scraggly christmas tree
there peter watch a tape of
a minor leaguer on the lowell spinner a SingleA boston
affiliate
billy come in

how do it go

how do what go

Hatteberg

he can barely hold a baseball
but he be
we guy now
billy sit

who be that

that be kevin Youkilis
this be the guy
we want more than anyone else in the
world
billy watch the guy on the screen
he be an overweight
righthanded batter with a peculiar stance

he can not run throw or field
but he
walk more than anyone in baseball except
barry bond
take out intentional walk
and it be more than bond
he be the greek
god of walk
on the the batter take another pitch just off the
edge of the strike zone



i tried to get shapiro to draft he last
june
he said he waddle like a duck
boston take he
boston will not let he go
yet
they be going to wait and see
they watch he lay off a pitch an inch outside the strike
zone
peter give billy a look that say you see that

you all right billy

billy
grady have appear behind they at the door

yeah
yeah
grady close the video room door for privacy
the only
other person in sight be manager art howe in he office
in street clothes
he shut he windowed door so grady
and billy can talk in confidence

you boy and i have a talk while you be
in tacoma
i do not like much of what i
hear

no

no
you get a kid in there with a yale
economics degree and a scout out here
with year baseball experience and
you be listening to the wrong one

i do not listen to anyone you know that

this be not a joke

i be not joking



this be not how you run a ball club with
a computer
you know that
you be a
baseball man
there be intangible
that only a scout can see in a player
that you be not going to pick up with
just number with someone who do not
play the game who know nothing about
the game but how to feed number into a
computer

that be what we be do
that be exactly
what we be do

if this be what baseball be if it be not
kirk gibson going up to the plate on two
bad leg because the manager feel in his
heart that he have one swing left in that
body
a computer would not do that
they would have have he sitting up in the
stand

computer do not romanticize the sport
leave that for the fan

well romance and the fan it be called a
love affair with the game and it be be
going on for one hundred and fifty year

i do not want to hurt you love affair with
the game
just because we have be do
it one way for a hundred and fifty year
do not mean we have be do it right
you have any idea how long people thought
the sun revolve around the earth
to
you eye it look like that be what be
happening

you be saying everybody be wrong
everybody

be you saying everybody be wrong

yes
maybe













you be making it impossible for yourself
to get another job once schott fire you
after this catastrophic season you be
setting we all up for and you be going to
have to explain to you wife and you kid
why you be working at dicks sport
goods

personal crisis and you seem indifferent
to the fact that you be taking a whole
organization down with you
i be playing

what

if baseball do not work out
have you
think about what you might do

the game only be over for three
hour i have not have that much time to
think about it

sure
maybe real estate

i will be honest if i do not make it in
baseball i do not think i be going to be
able to afford much real estate

i

i know what you mean

it be just a slump right

no

you be saying every scout be wrong

you be kind of saying it too



honey
do not you think you should
divorce i now while you be young



when a science experiment fail in a lab
thing blow up


problem be the price you pay for progress
branch rickey
billy shove a wad of copenhagen under he lip as he and
peter walkandtalk

get i wade

why

get he

why

get he
Billys seated at he desk
peter reluctantly dial a
number from a list the number across from the Phillies
gms name
it connect on the speaker

hello

ed
billy
i need some help on defense
and i be will to trade jeremy Giambi
for it

no you

ignore peter
to

who you get










put the call on











i do
he career be stagnant to put it
nicely
can we say it be do in theory
and start draw up paperwork

okay
but

great

i think he be going to say something
else

peter
rule number
when you get the
answer you be looking for hang up
that be do and in a minute penas going
to detroit

i do not think you want to do that

art can not put he at first if he be
playing for the tiger and i want Hatte
in the lineup tonight

maybe you should think about this
you be upset and this be this

what be i missing

it be just a very hard move to explain
people be going to think you have lost
you mind

why be that a problem peter

do not make an emotional decision billy

david Dombrowskis on



sometimes you have to shake it up
david penas going on the block
you be i first call
because he be
making the rest of the team look bad
he be going to be rookie of the year

not eager to help
but

probably an all star

he be an all star dave
wink at peter

it be more like he be create selfesteem
problem for the other guy
no i be
looking for a reliever and some cash
ok
five minute dave i be not waiting
what be the problem

trying to slow it

billy pena be an all star
if you dump
he and if Hatte do not work out you
know this be the kind of decision that
get you fired

why you worrying about i job
you worried about i job or yours

i be worry about yours

well you should be worry about yours
because if this thing we be do do not
work
neither of we have job

that be probably true



in which case i be a year old guy with
a highschool diploma and a daughter who
i would like to be able to put through
college one day
you be year old with a degree from
yale and a pretty impressive
apprenticeship
i do not think we be asking the right
question
i think the question we be
suppose to be asking now be do you
believe in what we be do or not
it be a problem that you think we need to
explain ourselves
do not
to anyone
i be going to see this through for well
or for bad
just tell i do you
project we will win more game with pena or
Hatteberg on first

it be close billy but theoretically
Hatteberg

what be we talking about then

dave
that works
great
there be just one more
thing i need
i do not want the guy
paying for sodaI want you to stock i
soda machine for three year
uh huh uh
huh great
then that be a deal

that be thoughtful

yeah
okay
you get to tell pena to pack

you want i to tell pena he be be
trade

BILLYs blackberry buzze
Sngl up the mdl rns scr

okay
billy talk to chavez and ellis
peter stand nearby

no more bunts

no more bunts

bunt be an out
you be paid to avoid
out not make they

bunt be not an out
it be a sacrifice

bunt be for pitcher and weak hitter
you be not a pitcher Chavvie so what
be you saying
until the third out anything can happen
after the third out it be over
you
get to protect you out like they be you
child
every outas precious do not
give em away



another thing you should see more
pitch
we want to get into they
bullpen
deep into they bullpen
we
want to see pitch by the end of the
th inning
you want to get you atbats
off they th and th pitcher

you want we to walk more
how much more

pete

at least once every ten at bat

or

TripleA Sacramentos only mile away
and there be no flight
as they look to

do not look at he
here the deal
i be
not interest in what you think you know
about baseball or what you think i do not
know about it
i be not interest in
guts or heart or determination or
anything else the fan or you mother
love about you
i be interest in you
get on base
if you do that we win
if you do not we lose
and i hate to
lose
i hate to lose more than i need to
win
there be a difference
billy and peter give advice to dye and byrnes

every at bat be like a hand of blackjack
every card that be deal you odds
completely change
for instance every
first pitch strike you bat average
go down about point

point

point
every first pitch ball it
go up about the same amount
so you
get to lay off the first pitch



first pitch curveball or first pitch
fastball

first pitch period
when you swing at
the first pitch you be batting


we want to see more pitch

how many pitch

every starter we want to see pitch
by the th inning

so
pitch per at bat

yeah
i mean Hatteberg drained
pitch

and Byrnsie you be hackin at
everything
you be all squirrely out
there
wait for you pitch man
this
be a war of attrition
there be no clock
on this thing
wait em out
let they
make the mistake
and when you enemy
making mistake do not interrupt they
peter advise durham as he work out

basically these be all you at bat
this be you versus righties you versus
lefty
and then of course all you
count knowledge okay
in an count
you be batting

in an you
average

in a

when
you be you be batting

understand what i be saying

not really

i know it be a lot of math
when you
first pitch be a strike you bat
average go down about point



when it be a ball it go up about
if you draw a ball on you first pitch
you be unstoppable
if you strike on the
first pitch you might as well be jumping
off cliff
i be trying to get you to lay
off the first pitch

but i be a first pitch hitter
i like to
swing at fastballs

and that be the way you have be trained
but it be a habit we would like to break you
from
we be trying to design the game to
you strength
this have nothing to do
with you be a great hitter you be a
great hitter
we just want to get you on
base

but if i get i pitch i be going to swing at
it no matter what the count be

i be not worry about you crushing the
ball out of the park
i just want you to
lay off anything that will result in a
strike

i guess i will have to watch some film and
take a look at it

absolutely
the video room be open to
you any time i be always available
and with a group of player around the card
table postgame

but seriously
make he use up all
he bullet

yeah make he work

so
mr
beane

Billys fine





nah make it mr
beane

mr
beane

i be screwin with you Haddie

so we just do not steal

that be right

that be what i do
that be what you pay i
to do

no i pay you to get on first not get
throw out at second

i do not get throw out much

i do not hit on at the blackjack table
but if i do the odds would be the same

you have actually get catch out of
try this season

i get of
that be not bad

you just hand they an out
protect
you out like they be you child
there be no clock on this game
until the
third out anything can happen
get on
base and let the next guy move you up
pass the torch pass the torch
we be
like a machine
run making machine
as and prepare food

what be you big fear



baseball be hit in i general
direction

that be funny
no seriously

if we have a lead late in the game and
they have runner on base i would rather not
see Magnante out of the bullpen

i will make that decision when the time
come

that be what you should do
Baseballs a
game of situation and you should make
the decision when the time come
except
you should make it now



do not bring Magnante out if we have get to
hold a late lead with runner on
he be
he be scared shitless of be the guy
who blow this win streak

you think a lot of yourself do not you

i
think the regular amount of
myself
Magnante on the other hand he
do not think very much of himself at
all and when he tighten up we have get
ourselves an adventure
so i would like to
see chad bradford out of the pen tonight
when we be in let we say just to make it
easier for you any situation
Rightylefty two out no out the
umpire have decided we be going to
finish the game by playing dart
whatever
bradfords the first guy out of
the pen
okay

i could have coach you up you know

i do not think so

you think you go as far as you could
have



yeah that be what i mean
play bradford
step out of arts office into
the game play on as bench press
the as be
up by three run in the ninth inning but the indian have
a runner on first
through the tunnel can hear the crack of the bat
and a collective groan from the stand
hold the barbell in the airfrozenas he simply
look at the

and see the silent image
walking to the mound tapping he leave hand
head to the mound
we think BILLYs going to trash the weight but he
simply return the barbell to the bracket sit up and
watch the silent image
mop he brow squint for the sign wind up
and make he pitch
it miss low for ball four and
walk to first
billy lay back on the bench breathe then unmutes the


and we hear

Magnante have quickly let two on base for
lee stevens who be the go ahead run for
the indian in a game that oakland
appear to have put away
and then sit calmly
wait for it
and

nod he head at the inevitable



that ball be deep
way back
three run
homer for lee stevens to put cleveland
ahead in the ninth inning
can hear people boo they lung out
he
take a moment then grab he jacket
the be boo as make he way to the mound to
take out
make he way from the
bullpen and take the ball from
turn to head back to the dugout but slow as he see
a strange sight
be standing at the dugout rail
the plate notice and follow arts line of sight
he see and walk over there ahead of art

you can not be in there billy
do not move
he just watch as he come into
the dugout

billy
the be watch to see what be going to happen
put he hand on art shoulder a second as he say


just nod a little bitnot too muchlike
i be assure you you do not just make a
calamitous vocational decision

player and coach only billy

ignore the umpire
still quietly to

remember that in about four second
see one of the nearby camera pivot over to
catch this conversation

yeah there it be
we be the lead story
on sport center now so let i be brief
first of all that be an awfully costly
fuckyou would not you say

the as begin this road trip on a game
win streak picking up two game on
the mariner and the angel and it
should be noted this be they long
win streak in six year heading into
mounted in center field

to the lens
peter sit with Hatteberg reviewing he hit on a
monitor

this be a chart of what you should and
should not be swinging at
these circle
represent different pitch
red be hit
blue be out yellow miss or foul
green be chase white taken
this be
you versus conway
what do you see

i be chasing a lot of high and outside

the red be where most hit happen
that be where you want to be swinging
you do not want to be swinging at the junk
at the top of the strike zone
we would
rather take those strike because you be
not going to hit em out of the park
and you be good about that patient



right now you be averaging about
pitch per atbat

per bat

yeah and that be great
one of the
reason why we love you
you be draining
a pitcher pitch
now guy like
bond and jason Giambi average a little
over
that be top tier
do this
chart make sense to you

yeah
i will get on base more if i lay off
anything high
this be awesome
so you
have a breakdown of this from every game

every game
you instinct be in the
right place
this be not something they
teach you in little league
this be
something fundamental we be looking for
how to wear out a pitcher arm
if
you be about to face conway and wonder
what you should and should not swing at
come in here and watch how you be
tending
you can click on any one of
these pitch and watch it happen
pretty great right

show i some of the stuff i be chasing up
high
of hundreds of at bat register and
changing modality to produce graph and number

to reveal we be now in
peter and bradford review footage
peter analyze the data with billy as they throw a ball
back and forth

everybody think the first pitch be
what be most important but it be not
it be the first two out of three pitch
that matter the most



the difference between and be the
difference between a scrub and an all
star

so you be saying if we can get we guy
to lay off the first pitch it will put we
in the driver seat

any sort of extra discipline in the first
three pitch will help we
game be on in the background
billy make various
comment the the screen

that be a problem right there
terrance
jog to first
mr
justice
that be what we pay you for
chad bradford you deceptive son of a
bitch i love you
he be a pain in the ass but that Giambi
get on base
another train of thought

Hatteberg once have walk in at
bat

i whole career i only have eighteen
walk

actually


shut up
and now we have


migs let we make a deal
i will pay you
fifty buck for every away fastball you
hit to opposite field but you have get to
pay i fifty for every one of those you
pull


tejada immediately start think about it
be working out
billy poke he head in

hey
do you car get egg

yeah

i think i just get an email from the
culprit
he said he be tire of paying
good money just to watch you jog
around the base

what the hell do that have to do with
anything

i do not know man
do not worry about it
billy exit
long call after

who bring egg to the ballpark anyway
billy and mecir walk down the hall with the smelly stain

the same shot as at the begin
the coliseum from high
above only this time the final game of the division
series be be play at home



minnesota twin at oakland as
the camera pan down the huge scoreboard
it be
excruciating
the number on the board tell we it be be
an incredibly close game but the as be losing by one
run in the bottom of the ninth with two out and nobody
on


ray durham stand in at the plate
strike one to the
durham as we hear the venerable voice of ESPNs joe
morgan who be speaking postgame

the flaw in the as think and this
come from the top of they organization
be they failure to comprehend you have
to manufacture run in the post season
durham foul off a pitch
strike two

you have to steal
you have to bunt
you
have to sacrifice
you have to trust in
small ball not billy ball
durham swing at the fastball and connect but it be a
pop fly to second which a easily nab
the throw he glove in the air and the
run out to the mound as the rest of the twin run to the
middle of the field to begin they victory celebration
durham turn away and head back to the dugout
the as have lost the series

they think they have devise a science to
win game
they think it reside in a
computer
they thumb they nose at
fundamental
at tradition
at baseball

harrow by the defeat stare at the listen
to joe morgan

they be bean counter in oakland
that be
bean with an e at the end
they be card
counter at the blackjack table who
forget the house always win

peter a wooden chair to piece with a baseball
bat



peter in exhaustion he eye glue again to the screen
watch shot of euphoric twin
reveling and as stun at they misfortune
begin to slowly move towards the pile
of celebrating player on the mound and as we near the
sound begin to fade and the
as do the and
in
an empty stadium towards the dugout where the last of
the broom the floor
down a dimly light cinder block corridor and
finally into the
where we discover a solitary figure
the camera come to settle on the oakland as player
