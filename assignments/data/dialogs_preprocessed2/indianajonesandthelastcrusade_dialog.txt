catch he blood at the crucifixion
and be entrust to joseph of
Arimathaea

the arthur legend
i have hear
this bedtime story before

eternal life doctor jones
the
gift of youth to whoever drink
from the grail
oh now that be a bedtime story i would
like to wake up to

an old mane dream

every mane dream
including you father i believe

grail lore be he hobby
he be a teacher of medieval
literature
the one the student
hope they do not get


walter you be neglect we
guest

be along in a moment dear



hard to resist be not it
the
holy grail final rest place
described in detail

what good be it
this grail
tablet speak of desert and
mountain and canyon
pretty
vague
where do you start
looking
maybe if the tablet be
intact you would have something to
go on
but the entire top
portion be miss

just the same an attempt to
recover the grail be currently
underway

let i tell you another bedtime
story doctor jones
after the grail be entrust
to joseph of Arimathaea it
disappeared and be lost for a
thousand year before it be find
again by three knight of the
first crusade
three brother
to be exact

i have hear this one as well
two of these brother walk out
of the desert one hundred and
fifty year after have find
the grail and begin the long
journey back to france
but
only one of they make it
and
before die of extreme old
age he supposedly impart
he tale to ato a franciscan
friar i think

not supposedly doctor jones



this be the manuscript in which
the friar chronicle the knight
story
it do not reveal on
location of the grail i be afraid
but the knight promised that two
marker that have be left
behind would
this tablet be one of those
marker
it prove the knight
story be true
but as you pointed
outits incomplete
now the second marker be
entomb with the knights dead
brother
we project leader
believe that tomb to be locate
within the city of venice italy
as you can now see doctor jones
we be about to complete a great
quest that begin almost two
thousand year ago
we be only
one step away

that be usually when the ground
fall out from underneath you
foot

you could be more right than you
know

yes

we have hit a snag
we project
leader have vanished
along with
all he research
uh we received
a cable from he colleague doctor
schneider who have no idea of he
whereabouts or what be become of
he
i want you to pick up the trail
where he left off
