magnitude of it
but war

glistening with
sweat the postman stop to stretch
across the way he
see bandit talking to getty
getty glance at the
postman who return to work watch under he eyebrow as
idaho join the group
there be trouble brew here
worried the postman look to woody who watch the
exchange as well
he be as usual inscrutable


the river be swell and swift from the spring thaw
marching along the east ridge above it the army be given
the order to halt
the postman look ahead to where idaho confer with
bethlehem
something wrong
they look to where
two carbinetoting soldier stand alertly at guard by a
thicket across the river
rotten wood and rope bridge
span the space between the ridge
idaho ride to the conscript

one of you dog have earned himself
a treat
over there
idaho point to the thicket as he proceed down the line

those man hunted themselves a lion
this morning

the sound out of he then look back to the postman
grim the postman start forward look from the rotten
bridge to the water and back again as he move
all eye on he as he start across


the postman step lightly
far below the river rage
