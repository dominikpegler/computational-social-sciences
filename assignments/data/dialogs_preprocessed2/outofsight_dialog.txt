tell you the truth i do not know
i
start when i be eighteen drive
for i uncle cully and he partner
gus
they go into a bank this one
time in Slidell gus jump the counter
to get the teller and break he leg
all three of we end up in angola

that be funny

i think so too

it be i i would have left ol gus on
the floor

i believe you would have
another fall
i do seven year at lompoc
and i
do not mean the place next door where
some of nixons people go

i know the difference
you be in
lompoc the federal penitentiary
i have deliver people there
so
basically you have spent half you life
in prison

basically
yeah
if i go back now i
do a full thirty year no time off
can you imagine looking at that

i do not have to
i do not rob bank

you do not seem all that scare

of course i be

you do not act like it

what do you want i to do
scream
i
do not think it would help much
i be just going to sit back take it easy
and wait for you to screw up

jesus you sound like i exwife

you be marry
all those fall
i be surprise you have time

it be just a year give or take a few
day
i mean it be not like we do not
get along or anything
we have fun we
just do not have that
that thing
you know
that spark you know what i
mean
you get to have that

Uhhuh

we still talk though

sure

you know this be not going to end well
these thing never do

yeah well if it turn out i get shoot
like a dog it will be in the street
not off a goddamn fence

you must see yourself as some kind of
clyde barrow

oh you mean of bonnie and clyde
hm
you ever see picture of he the way
he wear he hat
you could tell he
have that do notgiveashit air about
he

i do not recall he hat but i have see
picture of he lying dead shot by
texas rangers
do you know he do not
have he shoe on

be that right

they put a hundred and eightyseven
bullet hole in clyde bonnie parker
and the car they be driving
bonnie
be eating a sandwich

you be full of interesting fact be not
you

it be may near Gibsland
louisiana

that part in the movie where they get
shot
warren beatty and
i can not
think of she name

faye dunaway

network
yeah she be good

and the guy saying he be not going to
take any more shit from anybody

peter finch

yeah right
anyway that scene where
warren beatty and faye dunaway get
shot
i remember think at the time
it would not be a bad way to go if you
have to

bleed on a country road

it be not pretty after no but if you
be in that car eating a sandwich
you would not have known what hit you

you be sure easy to talk to

say we meet under different circumstance
and get to talking say you be in a
bar and i come up to you i wonder
what would happen

nothing

i mean if you do not know who i be

i be just saying i think if we meet under
different circumstance

you have to be kidding

another one faye dunaway be in i liked
three day of the condor

with robert redford when he be young
