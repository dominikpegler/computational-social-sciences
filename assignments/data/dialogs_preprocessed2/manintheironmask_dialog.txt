oh louis louis

aramis
be this the way to hell

hell may be we destination dear
Porthos but not this trip

where be we

jesus of nazareth find the holy
among the profane
if we be to
have a place of private prayer
where well than here beside the
channel where the shit and the
garbage run to the river

mother of god

it be also a place of burial

tomb
we be in a tomb

catacomb
very holy

Yaaaahhh

relax you big fool it be
dArtagnan

it be all right
DArtagnan be the
one who warn we that he would be
given an order for you arrest
here you have sanctuary do he
not dArtagnan

look at we
we be old man now
but
once we be young
and when we see
injustice we fight it

we have grow wise with age
now
we know that some problem cannot be
settled with a sword

and some problem cannot be settled
without one

well here be the problem at hand
the king have ordered i to discover
the identity of the governor general
of jesuit and kill he
as we
english rival have left the
catholic church louis have strike on
a plan to dominate the whole of
europe by uniting church and state
and making himself head of both
he
have already pick the pope
only
the jesuit who put god above
throne or papacy stand in he way

but do not god ordain both pope
and king

so they tell we
but what be we to
believe when the king be a tyrant
and the church mean to stand for
all those oppressed have become the
tool of oppression
when no
conscience be tolerate
no
dissent no objection

it be a weighty problem aramis
but perhaps you should leave it to
this secret general of the jesuit
whoever he might be

easy to say but hard to do
for
what i be trying to tell you be that
i be the governor general of jesuit
in france

what do you propose to do

replace the king

i cannot hear this

it can not be do

it can
i know the way

i be with you

no
stop

i will need you all
all for one
one for all

you you cannot ask i to betray
i king
i have sworn to he

it be honor you serve and when the
king be dishonorable you be remove
from you oath of honor

an oath be an oath precisely because
it cannot be remove

why do you follow he dArtagnan
i know you have put service above
you own life but why do this
king deserve such loyalty
he be a
monster
he execute minister for
he own blunder with they
family hostage so they take the
blame
he have no honor

no man be all bad
or all good
i
believe i must believe that
louis can learn
and perhaps i can
help he

whatever the plan
i be in it
the next time we meet one of we
will die

Porthos see to athos will not you

i have hear many confession
dArtagnan
but even if i be not
a priest i could tell you heart
have a secret weight and it be
hurting you to carry it alone

the secret i carry i cannot share
not even with god

i cannot betray louis
i will
defend he with i life

i know
god go with you

this way

what be they do

making the key to the throne

they be very large key

Porthos sleep and you plot
do not
you think it be time you told i what
it be you be plotting

soon enough
here we be

the prison of belle sur

come we have a boat waiting

what be that

body

i see that be a body
but where do
you get it

he get one day of confession each
year
today be the day

who do

good not to ask
should not even
talk about it

what do we do now

i do not know about you but i plan
to wait here

who be this then

he say he be the replacement

he say it be only one day a month
when the prisoner get confession
and the little one be too sick to
move

but be the other one all right
please tell i he be not dead too
or i will have lost everyone

i position be
ordained by god

DArtagnan
guard

help

out there
look
out there
he

i just left the garden it be
empty
what do you see

it
be nothing
nightmare
nothing more
go away i

check the garden


aramis
athos
he look exactly
like
exactly like

i will answer all you question
but first soap water and a razor

yes
identical

the great secret of life be who
we truly be
now i must give you
that secret which have be keep
from you you whole life
it begin
on the night when louis be born

i remember that night
DArtagnan
be drunk the only time i have see
he that way
the three of we be
reveling remember athos

but i be on duty

i be summon to the royal
apartment
arrange a carriage
they told i and wait by the door
of the stable

they bring a baby from the back of
the palace into the black carriage
i have waiting
they have given the
driver instruction about where it
be and i be ordered to make the
whole journey with the blind of the
carriage draw

i carry that baby into the
countryside to a chateau like this
one
and there i left he

i have never forgotten that night
or what i carry

i do not understand
what do this
have to do with
you carry a
baby somewhere it be unusual but

not just a baby Porthos
i carry
the child of the king

the child of the king be
the
king
louis

no not louis

athos do you understand this
he
confuse i

i carry the king child
the
queen have twin that night and one
of they be send away in secret

but why

because the old king have a twin as
well and through he whole reign
he brother fight he for the
throne
then he have two heir not
just son but twin
so he decided
that one be put away as if he never
exist
you phillippe

the old king ordered you be educated
and well treated but you identity
keep from you and all those around
you

on he death bed he revealed you
existence to louis and you mother
you mother have be tell by she own
priest that you have die at birth
somehow she blame herself for ever
believe it and she wished to
restore you birthright
but now
louis be king

priest even a pope he could kill
without hesitation but he be
afraid to kill you for he whole
claim to power rest on the sanctity
of royal blood
so he have you
hidden in a way that only a monster
could devise
i know for it be i
who take you to prison and the iron
mask
someday i will ask you
forgiveness
but not until we have
restored to you what be yours

restored

we will replace louis with
phillippe
no one but the king
himself and now we know
phillippe even exist
all we have
to do be switch they

switch
that be you plan
it be
ludicrous

i have it all worked out

physical resemblance be but one
small thing
louis have an
arrogance a manner

those can be adopted

and people close to he who

do you think i have not considered
that
i have a plan and you may
rest assured that it be brilliant

it be not just we live you risk
with this conceit of yours
it be
Phillippes as well

yes and he have a choice

what about it phillippe
all that
time in prison all that time you
suffer be it for nothing
you
memorize the entire bible or so
you priest told i
an act of
survival of defiance of courage
you year within the mask have
given you reserve of strength that
other could not imagine
you home
be a dungeon and now you may be a
king if you have the heart to make
it so
do you have the heart

i will try

you see
king

recent hour have be a shock

perhaps not as much as you might
imagine
when tutor answer every
question except those about who i
be
when i be imprisoned in a way
no other man have ever be i know
there be something different about
i
but a king

phillippe
there be something i
hope you understand
terrible
cruelty have be used against you
and
you must understand that you
do nothing to deserve it

there be
wrath
in i
i have
learned to hide it
those year in
the cell i dream that freedom
would someday just happen the way
the mask happen
now i be free
and with each free breath i feel the
grow desire to make someone
suffer for all i lost
look at
this all this that for ten year i
could not see
what if i become a
king a king no different from i
brother

the desire for vengeance
can be a
poison

what be it antidote

i suppose
it be to remember there
be many people who have never be
in a prison who pass such beauty
every day and never see it

you look so sad
be it something i
have do

it be something i have do or
do not do

what be that

i do not share beauty with
someone
who be no longer here for
i to share beauty with

we have much to do we would best get
start
now suppose you be to
walk into a garden as a king

more wine

how be he

resting he be have a long day
aramis

more wine

you must reconsider this plan
phillippe be like a child he

you can do it

in a year maybe two i could teach
he enough to

three day

three day

the king be have a ball a
masquerade ball
it be the perfect
opportunity and perhaps we only
one
at any time phillippe could be
discover and what then
remember
france
remember the poor
remember raoul
more wine
where
be those serving girl

it be no use
i sword be bent

it will be all right
you be just
taking a while to get start

no it be dead
i be useless

phillippe he be very bright he be
perceptive but he be in such
turmoil

you grow fond of he
that be good

do not play god with i aramis i

go on

but what be Porthos do

go into the barn naked or so
it appear

now
you be saying

but what be he do

about to hang himself i should
think

hang himself

he be threatened to do it it be be
building up in he for month

we must stop he

come now athos if Porthos be
determined to end he life then he
will certainly manage to find the
opportunity

but but

adieu cruel life
farewell to
useless Porthos

i saw the main beam in half

i be a genius not an engineer

aramis
you do this do not you
you know i would try hanging myself
and you saw the beam
admit it
admit it by god


well of course i know it Porthos

you have be mope for month
now
that you have get the idea of
killing yourself out of the way you
can stop boring i and start be
useful to i
now get some rest

well
well
okay



poor phillippe

the mask be terrifying
especially
when unexpected
do you notice

all i notice be that phillippe
feel even more like an animal

see Porthos secret be hard to
keep
we do not have much time

i have worn this mask so long i
could not sleep without it

i will sit with you
i can not sleep
either

athos
thank you for be i
guide
back into the world

where be you going

paris
there be still much to do
we will be back soon
be ready

but aramis
phillippe can learn
in time but

he can learn to be phillippe in
time
but first he must learn to be
louis and for that he have two more
day

what you be asking be impossible

i offer you the perfect revolution
revolution without bloodshed
without any loss of life even
without treason for he too be the
son of the king

but

you said you would do anything athos
anything to replace this king
so
do it

no wait do not hold you goblet
that way
with a king it be
so

it be not to be dainty
servant
have touched the kings goblet so
he will touch it as little as
possible

i be so sorry
forgive i i

no
do not be sorry
never be
sorry
the king care for nothing
and for no one
there be no
mistake when you be king
what
you do be right for every person

king have contempt for everyone

be that the king of king you wish i
to be
or do you say this because
of you son

how do you know

Porthos told i

i be not
i be not angry with you
you understand
good
now as to
acting like a king we wish you to
be a good king
but at first
at
first you must pass as louis and
louis be cold and cruel
so you
must stop looking at people with
such softness
it be
not kingly
the eye of a king say that all he
care about be himself and you
eye how do i tell he this
you eye
ask so much
you
should not care about i about i
about

oh raoul i son

phillippe know kingly posture
how to sit in a chair like a king on he throne and then
phillippe trying it with athos then playing the roll of a
courtesan paying homage
of they feeling embarrass and ridiculous they laugh
