i missionary ancestor come to the
island and told the hawaiian to put
on clothes work hard believe in
christ and stop surf and hula
dance
they make business deal
along the way buying an island or
marry a princess and inherit she
land
now they descendant wear
bikini and running shorts play beach
volleyball and surf and take up hula
dance
hawaii have always be a
place of contradiction


of honolulu begin a pattern of montage to be
interspersed throughout the film



i friend on the mainland think just
because i live in hawaii i live in
paradise
like a permanent vacation
we be all just out here drink mai
tais shaking we hip and catching
wave
be they nut
how can they
possibly think we family be less
screw up we heart attack and
cancer less fatal we grief less
devastate

surfboard in fifteen year


we from a panorama of honolulu to find yearold
seated amid atop a makeshift desk he
have bring he work with he

for the last day i have be living
in a paradise of ivs and urine bag
and endotracheal tube and sixmonth
old magazine
paradise
paradise
can go fuck itself
matt look up at the we see in the speedboat now lying
stiffly on an upright she head cock to one
side a feed tube in she nose a ventilator in she
trachea ivs in she arm



this be elizabeth king i wife
twentythree day ago she be launch
from a powerboat during a race and hit
she head almost drowned
now she be in
a coma that score on the glasgow
scale and on the rancho los amigos
scale score showing an extremely
severe coma
liz be very competitive
whatever she do she do to the
full


matt be get the current

she react nonpurposefully to stimulus
in a nonspecific manner but
occasionally she response be
specific though inconsistent
she
reflex be primitive and often the
same regardless of stimulus
presented



it be exactly what elizabeth used to
accuse i of


matt continue to observe she



twentythree day in a coma and any
day now the doctor will give i they
final verdict if she be going to come
out of it or not
then i have a
decision to make
wait that be wrong
liz have a live will

the descendant shooting draft draft





like always she make she own
decision
but i know she be going to
pull through
he

hi noe what be up

matt you have a call from scotties
teacher
she say it be urgent

yeah sure
put she on



show lying in she hospital bed
the
composition be odd the uncomfortably

matt confer with fifthgrade teacher
hayashi and school
counselor



we just do not think these photograph
be appropriate for scottie to be
sharing with she classmate
some of
they go home quite disturbed and we
get some angry call from parent

yeah she be sort of be going to town
with the whole picturetaking thing
but i have no idea


i can not tell you how i heart go out
to you and you family but scottie
just have not be herself
principal
cruz agree with we that it maybe would
be good for scottie to remain at home
with you during this difficult time

home
see i would think that stick
to she normal routine would be the good
thing for she you know keep she
occupied
i would not really know how
to




i mean i have kind of get i hand full
and she sister away at school on the
big island
i do not think scottie
would really want to hang out with i
when she could be with she friend and
people like you who specialize in
child


mr
king we see this every day
child acting out at school when
something wrong at home
and you
family be facing a devastate crisis
have you be engaging scottie in
really talking about what be going on
encouraging she to express she
feeling
that be crucial

oh yeah
yeah
absolutely



this shit be banana
banana
this shit be banana
they look over to see

in place and in she own world just outside
the classroom door
down the hall eye she
suspiciously

this shit be banana
banana
matt stare aghast at this specimen called he daughter
the
lady glance between scottie and matt wonder when or
whether he will intervene
finally


scottie that be not a good choice
be you making a good choice

melnick family reunion


Dorks

until last year party when she
locked i out of the house and i have to
sit outside all day while everybody be
inside
she think she be so great
but then i become friend with reina
and brooke and get popular

what


answer the door

thank you for coming by


as matt and scottie be show inside they remove they
shoe

i forget to mention the time scottie
said she do not want to be Lanis
partner at the rock wall because she
do not want to fall into i daughter
butt crack
that do not even make
sense
barb now lead they into

where sit on a couch
matt be impatient to
be do with this meaningless task

scottie do you have something you want
to say to lani

here
scottie you be going to stop right
and you be really really sorry right
scottie make a big exaggerate nod

i do not think she be sorry at all
she be going to keep do it
i can
tell

no she will not
it be like the time lani
locked scottie out of the house at she
birthday party and scottie sit outside
by herself
it be a mean thing to do
but lani here probably do it just to
show off right
lani think a moment nod

but i be not about to declare that one
action define a human be entire
character
she be a work in progress
and like all complex people be a bundle
of contradiction

i do not know about that

you bring i cake

the descendant shooting draft draft



you bring she cake
so i do not
know maybe lani should be the one to
apologize since this incident may have
be the catalyst for all this
evil be the word you used


the door open and matt and scottie pause to slip they
shoe back on

oh and mr
king

yes

he
from they casual clthe and shaggy hair an observer
might hardly suspect they status



not only be i the sole but i be a
commercial real estate and
transactional attorney so the most
involve of i cousin have be
meeting with i regularly to analyze
the bid cousin dave cousin hal
cousin six cousin wink cousin lisa
cousin connie and cousin stan both of
whom oppose the sale entirely
do not

Holitzer
he be actually from kauai

encephalopathy be deteriorate
we
see no eye movement no pupillary
response basically no brainstem
reflex whatsoever
the machine

of life would be
very poor

she will
never be like she be matt
never

we know that now
matt sit very still


i can not tell you how sorry i be to have
to tell you this

i have a legal
obligation
you know that

the descendant shooting draft draft



how long will she last

the descendant shooting draft draft




that be right
it be an octopus
such a
funny creature with it eight leg
but do you know octopi be actually
extremely intelligent like dog and
cat
they have unique personality
and just like we they have a lot of
defense mechanism
i be sure you know
about the ink sac
she use ink to
confuse she predator
she can
camouflage herself
she can emit
poison and some can mimic more
dangerous creature like the eel
i
keep she to remind i of we defense
mechanism we ink we camouflage
we poison all the thing we use to
keep away hurt
the reason dr
johnston invited i here today be to
meet you scottie

unique and spirit girl

she be in what we call an irreversible
coma

anymore


not exactly but
yes that be the
general idea

happen
that be why she be not
attached to the machine anymore

it be for the good scottie
