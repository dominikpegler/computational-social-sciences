possess a natural gift for it

you do decide to give up then i
would really like to buy you
piano

why would not they appeal it



fear of be deported
it used to
be that when you asylum case be
deny they let you go until you
appeal
lot of people do not
bother with it
get denied once
be enough to spook they

so what happen if that be the case


then there may be a final order of
deportation on he which mean he

time
he will just be deported

they have to leave syria
they have
no choice

no
not really
i just come down to
present a paper at a conference

you write it

yes
well i coauthored it

congratulations


and what happen after the
hear

we appeal
it take two year


and you appeal be denied

yes



then they should have send you a
bagandbaggage letter which
basically tell you where to show
up and be deported


but you do not receive it

no


you sure

yes
i would remember this


do you move

yes
eventually we have to
but we
have we mail advance


well it would not be the first time
that happen
and pre it
be not much of a priority tracking
people down

so if they do not get the letter
then do this help we


it keep we chance alive
if they
get it and just ignore it then we
could not push to reopen the case

so you can help he


it be still a long shot
like i
said the government approach have
changed radically



it be very black and white now
either you belong or you do not
which mean a lot of people who
have be living here for year be
suddenly be sweep up and throw
into detention
Tareks lucky
most of they do not
even have lawyer

lucky


relatively speaking
we just have
to move quickly to get an emergency
stay from the board of immigration
then we will stick with the motion
to reopen pending he green card
application

can you explain what that means


actually i do not have the time
right now
i have to be in court
very shortly

how long will he be in detention


i can not predict that
i be sorry but
