the big purse this sport have
ever see

hoopla surrounding tommy riordan
the war hero who have become an
overnight sensation

five minute paddy




it look as though the moment of
truth have arrive because here
come tommy riordan



tommy Riordans capture the
media attention but the question
still remains
who be this guy
and
more importantly can he compete in
this talent pool
can he win



i wish i know bryan
i wish i know
who he be and i have get to say the
fact that i do not know be strange
in an internet age where there be
no secret this guy be a complete
mystery
i can not find out anything
about he
tommy riordan be
officially Google proof



you get to love this guy sam
no
walk out music no sponsor no
interview
he skip out on the
press conference
would not have his
picture take for the program
he be
breaking every rule




the only reason that tommy be even
in this tournament be because of a
video showing he beating up mad
dog grimes in the gym



but the reason a lot of he fan
be in the stand be because of
another video which be even more
stun than the mad dog grimes
video
let i describe it for you
folk for the few who have not see
it and i do not know anyone who
have not but tommy riordan ripped
the door off a tank in the heat of
battle save life in the
process and then walk away
without claiming a medal
he ripped
the door off a tank



tommy riordan be a genuine war
hero i be not taking anything away
from the guy
he be a very very
tough guy bryan but the tank
do not hit back
we have see YouTube
sensation fail on the big stage
before

sam
he ripped the door off a tank



tommy riordan definitely have his
hand full in he first opponent
francisco barbosa
barbosa be
nothing to scoff at



yeah he be the real deal
very
tough guy
very high caliber
fighter
tommy riordan come out of
nowhere and i imagine he be going
to disappear just as quickly




great story but i think you boy
be about to be exposed as a YouTube
sensation

gentleman you have be given you
instruction
i expect a clean
fight
obey i command at all
time
defend yourselves at all
time
touch glove go back let we
do this



we be about to get the big answer
to the big question
be tommy
riordan for real
and here we go



Barbosas going to be looking for a
take down



definitely going to be looking for a
take down



barbosa be down
barbosa have be
knock out
tommy riordan be most
definitely for real




and now he be walking out of the
cage
he be leaving the cage
there
go another rule out the window



francisco barbosa be out cold and
he be out of this tournament
bryan

show time

you can do this

i want to hear you say it

i can do this

then let we go do this





riley have less than hour
to fill marco santos spot and he
basically have to rely on the word
of frank campana




and he choose brendan conlon which
quite frankly be something i just
do not understand

go get em son



i can understand coming out to no
music by why in the world would
you choose classical music for you
entrance



this be beethoven bryan
this be
ode to joy



i apology mr
renaissance man



you want to talk about renaissance
man you get to talk about frank
campana
very unorthodox trainer
and one of the good in the game
he be well known for use classical
music to train he fighter to
remain calm to remain patient and
to remain composed under pressure

classical music be about as fit
to this set as brendan conlon
be to this tournament
in fact let
i show you something


this be brendan conlon
he be a
feeder fish and he be about to get
drop into a shark tank

mon give the guy a break
at
least we have see he fight before
he be in the
we remember he

i remember he too
i remember he
be very unmemorable



midnight le get ready to climb
into the cage and go to work



when the bracket be announced
midnight think he would be going up
against marco santos
he be get to be
thril to be seeing brendan
conlon standing across from he

you ask for it




brendan retired from fighting some
year ago he be actually a high
school physics teacher now and
midnight have some fun with that at
the press conference



he said he be going to give the
teacher a serious lesson and that
get killed be no way to spend
a summer vacation

alright gentleman you have be
given you instruction i expect a
clean fight
obey i command at
all time
defend yourselves at all
time
touch glove go back let we
do this

have some fun baby

move
you get to move




midnight be all over brendan



this can not last much longer
this
will not last much longer
the teacher
just have no answer

mon brendan get outta there

get out of there
get out of there



and now he be get the hook in

second left



the end be near
can he make it to
the end of the round be the
question




second left and Brendans face
be turning purple
Conlons whole
world be about to go from day to
night

beautiful
beautiful
he do not
know what hit he



he be get a kimura locked in



be you kidding i




midnight be in big trouble



i do not think he be get anywhere to
go



this be not happening
this can not
happen

it just do bryan



brendan conlon tapped midnight
i
can not believe it

he tapped he out
he tapped he
out
he do it
he do it
he do
it



this be what make mix martial
arts so great
there be so many way
to lose
one tiny miscalculation at
any time and that be it



frank campana embracing he man
brendan conlon
i do not think
either one of they can believe what
just happen




great show of sportsmanship from
the teacher



that be a hallmark of frank
Campanas philosophy right there



midnight le be shock
he think
he have a free pass into the second
round but instead he be going home
he dominated the fight the entire
way but fell prey to a very
technical finish

very technical finish but come on
that be a fluke



you call it a fluke
i call it a
guy maintain composure and
waiting for he opportunity



conlon beat midnight

i hope you get a receipt for you
goldfish

yes




we be down to eight fighter soon
to be seven as Koba prepare to go
to work for the second time
tonight

something else sam



it be certainly possible bryan
Koba moving on to tomorrow night




mad dog fighting like a man
possess
like a man with
something to prove
