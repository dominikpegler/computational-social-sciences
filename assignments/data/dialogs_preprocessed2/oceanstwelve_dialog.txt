do you want some orange juice
i

augie one this be condor




this be augie one
go condor





we be fully crank here
let we go
to phase two




bring that orange juice



this be gatsby
we be green here






let we discuss briefly and to
begin with the category of
thief as distinguished from
the large category of what might
be term hardened criminal
the high level master
thief if you will be a very
small world
between six and ten
highlevel crew be operating in
europe at any give time
worldwide no more than twenty
the
most famous gaspar LeMarc be
either dead or retire and the
expectation be that no one will
replace he
the good news be the
trend be toward they extinction




for example
anecdotal evidence
suggest these people be personally
insufferable

they ego demand constant praise
and they embellish they exploit
to anyone who will listen
they
tell they own story endlessly
provided of course they be
talking to a fellow thief or an
intimate

those who interact with they on a
personal level be relegate to
position of total servitude with
no chance for growth or freedom
they live be treated as
secondary
many of they suffer from
depression
it be a crime for which
there be no law and yet cause
untold damage

amplify by the lectern
mic







that be impossible



thanks for coming
we can really
use you help on this one

i hope the scene have not be
contaminate



no force entry

not that we can find


we can not figure out how they
disable the alarm
we think
maybe they tried to short it out
somehow




no that would have trigger the
system

and damaged the circuit

well then i do not know how they
get in

they have to have known the code

we considered that but the mark
swear that nobody in the world
know the code except he
he
programme the last seven step of
the system himself
he set it and
never left the house again
when he
die we will probably have to
physically cut all the power line
to the house to get it off line

there be other way to get the
code
close loop
redundant server
titanium encasement
not bad

like what




uh
well they probably set up in
a house across the canal and
watch he type the code in
through a pair of binoculars

calling to isabel in the
bedroom
actually i do not know about that

unless he have a habit of typing in
the code like this

then he body would block the
view from across the canal

that be why they probably set up
over there

and used the mirror

i be guessing they would need a fifteen
hundred millimeter lens to get a
clear shot but






what be it

what be that



it be where the crossbow bolt hit

Toulour reach the base of the stairs and stop dead in his
track

Toulour nod

certificate

that be not for sale

you degas be worth three time

yen say something

we need to teach he a lesson




absolutely

all right let we stay calm
we do not need to overreact here
he said some disrespectful thing
that be true
but why antagonize
this guy
why get into something
with he
he be young and he be
filthy rich and he be get time on
he hand
we do not want to become
he betty noir
we can just fence
he paint and earn a lot more
than we would have from the
certificate

it be about reputation
you said so
yourself
we have to get that
certificate to Evelyns buyer or

we will make enough selling the degas
to pay off she buyer

then why do you make that trip
down there in the first place if
you do not want to get into
something

saul

turn he name over to isabel
in
exchange for get off we back
tough one to swallow

short of that
the only
appropriate response be to steal
he next job right out from under
he
just like he do to we

we do not even know we next job

we get ten million in that closet



danny point at the closet in the room

i cash in the degas take a moment
to think about we next move
Toulour be not going anywhere
you
guy be hyp he too much
you be letting he get inside you
head
everyone agree
danny open the closet
there be a picture frame in there but
it be be
stolen by Toulour
we hear the


we see a be transport to a heavily
secure truck


the truck exit the build and drive down a street with
security surrounding it


the motorcade head for the private airport
the secure box be loaded onto a plane as isabel and she male
secretary hess exit a plane nearby


isabel and hess heading into paris

why do i need to see all these
guy
when i track the munch
down in sweden i get all the
approval i needed with one phone
call




with Lenins shaving kit the
russian bring i in and it take
a single signature and i get it at
the airport a minute after i
arrive
what be so goddamned
special about the french
hess give she a look as though she should know good

without they signature you can not
do anything
you can not pull the
suspect over you can not do
surveillance on they you be not
even allow to contact they
they be real stickler about
sovereignty issue here


the bureaucrat look at isabel
all of she

isabel i could not possibly sign
those document in good conscience
without talking to you about the
case in detail
i realize you be in
a hurry and i schedule for the
rest of the day be quite full so
perhaps if you be interest in
be expedient we could discuss
the case
over dinner


isabel sit in the back with hess

Foucquets at eightthirty
apparently they a private room
well bring you kevlar
do not stop for that


the driver accelerate through a yellowred light almost
hitting
who deftly avoid get crush




that be not how i want to go

no
they walk on

very theatrical of you
asking to
meet here
like we be spy
meeting to do an exchange

why be you do this to we

do what

this be a game for you
for we it be
survival
be you that bore
i
mean

no
i would not do that
no
the
truth be
i make a bet
or maybe a
well word be a wager

what kind of wager


danny and Toulour sit across from each other
the bottom
quarter of the eifel tower be visible in the background

gentleman wager with a friend
of mine i mentor
few month
ago we be at he winter place in
nicaragua and another guest
referred to i as the great
thief in the world
i do not
object obviously but i mentor
fell silent
later i ask he
about it
he said if i really
wanted to say i be the good
thief
i would have to prove i be
well than the eleven of you




you know the benedict job make
wave even all the way over here

million dollar
that be a lot
of money



sorry

before you be find



yes million be a lot of money
it attract attention
so in a
way you bring this problem with
i on yourselves
you be victim
of you own success

here what i be going to do
you
tell i the name of you mentor
i will call he up and i will tell he
that you be the great thief in
the world
that i accept that to
be true
and in return
you
leave we alone let we go about we
business
how about that

he said you would probably say
something like that but he said
you would probably have you finger
crossed when you said it
danny frown pull he hand out of he pocket

so in this situation for the
purpose of i wager word
be not good enough
i have to
prove this on the ground

this mentor of yours
be he a
good thief in he day

who LeMarc



danny swallow

yeah
he


angle on the group they be slackjawed

who
yen say something

i think so too

LeMarc
the LeMarc
danny nod

god hate i
he hate all of we

hell this could go on forever

no
it be going to be settled by one
more job
single object

whatever it be let we just let he
have it

we can not

because of pride

because we beat he he will pay
benedict off
stun beat

now we be talking




one score for the whole thing

what do we have to do
i mean be
it a fair bet or be it like
the
coronation egg or something
danny point
that be it
that be the one

he want we to steal the coronation
egg

that be just
that be
what be
that

the holy grail

carl faberge the great
goldsmith in history constructed
the coronation egg in for the
wedding of czar nicholas and
alexandra
every world class thief
in the last year have tried to
steal it
no one have even come
close

that be because it be curse

what

it be unstealable

it be the only thing in LeMarcs
entire career that he go after
but failed to get
he tried three
time
long beat of silence

we get the egg and we be free




that be great except we can not get
it

it be not possible

then we go to jail
beat

well
where be it now


the be be taken off a plane
another
motorcade form and escort the vehicle into the city


the motorcade be completely stopped in traffic
in a nearby sedan isabel sit next to an italian
of same sort
hess be in the front seat

i be going to need surveillance on
both hotel phone tap room bug
people in the lobby and by every
exit

yes absolutely

if i have to guess i would say i will need
at least people a dozen
vehicle
and an oncall air unit

yes absolutely

okay one more thing and this be
crucial
these guy be extremely
sophisticated at avoiding
electronic surveillance so we will
need real state of the art stuff




i be talking synthetic aperture
pinhole camera wave reformation
mic with a high plank coefficient
and a passive input structure
you be not writing anything down
be you sure you be get all
this

yes absolutely

isabel sigh loudly and sink back into she seat


the motorcade arrive at the museum of modern art
we follow armored car and continue on to find danny walking
up the front step



angle on livingston as he subtly nod at something in the
distance
danny be standing next to he

what be i looking at

infra red motion detection
system
it be the gold standard

saul and linus back yet

and i can not find rusty


frank and yen look at an authorizedentry only door as a
member of the museum staff go through it
the door have a
complex doublelocking mechanism that would make it
impossible to pick
yen say something in chinese

what
yen say something in chinese again

well i do not know but that be one
nasty lock
danny approach

see rusty

we think he be with you



danny move off


basher be be question by danny

not since we first get here
about
an hour ago
danny move away

and where be saul and linus


isabel enter she room
suddenly she spin and draw she
pistol
she gun end up in Rustys face

jesus robert
i could have killed

he shrug
long beat as she take a look at he

i be old

coffee

whatever you
say
isabel give an exasperate sigh

why do i want to have coffee with
you

Isable nod

she be a real

she hated you

well she be nice enough to hide
it from i

rusty nod
he remember

you will never get it by the way

get what

you will think you have get it you will
be so close that you will be able to
taste it and then this guy the
night fox or whoever he be will
just take it right out of you
hand just like he do in
amsterdam
he be as good as LeMarc

it be not possible

you be in a bubble
