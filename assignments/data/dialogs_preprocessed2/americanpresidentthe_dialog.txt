the meet
right



you concern be not falling on deaf
ear
the environmental lobby have
known no great alley in the white

sydney we should leave mr

wade be throw into the
deep end of the pool on she first day
she have not even have a chance to read

you be right
i have not read it
if
someone have ask i yesterday i would
have tell they the quebec conference
be make up of six professional hockey
team
but what i do know be that it be
time for the president to run for
president again
leon kodak be as good
as it get when it come to electoral
strategy and i be certain he be tell the
president exactly what i would tell he
nail down michigan and california
where they make car and airplane
and burn plenty of fossil fuel
but if
i have read these eight hundred page
i would have discover that it be the
burn of fossil fuel that be be
mostly responsible for global warming and
that the percent reduction recommended
by the be a necessary first step
toward arrest the catastrophic greenhouse
effect that have go unchecked by this
administration

it be really time to

susan i promise you the white house
chief of staff will not let we leave
here until he be broken the bad news


i be afraid Sydneys right
although
not about michigan and california
the president have ask i to convey
to you that he be sending he energy
bill to the floor with a call for a
reduction of percent


the president be will to go it
alone on this but he be asking for
and frankly he be expect the full
support of the

the president expect we full
support


yes he be

the president dreamin


sydney

the president have critically
misjudged reality
if he honestly
think that the environmental
community be going to whistle a
happy tune while rally support
around this pitifully lame mockery of
environmental leadership just because
he be a nice guy and he be do well
than he predecessor then you boss
be the chief executive of fantasyland



let we take he out back and beat the
shit out of he

diminish the weight of i message
the have be at every president
for the last decade and a half that
global warming be a calamity the
effect of which will be second only
to nuclear war
the good scientist
in the world have given you every
reason to take the seriously
but i be going to give you one more
if

of this wonderful orchestra and i
wonder why nobody be dancing

wade that in i
country a guest at the palace of
louis and marie antoinette would
soon find they head in a guillotine
if they make the impertinent gesture
of dancing without so much as a
byyourleave from the king and the queen


i will bet no one accused louis of
be soft on crime

life in any way

because when it be the president it be
not personal
sydney i hired you
reputation
i hired a pit bull not
a prom queen

that be unfair

it be incredibly unfair
but you have
spent a lot of time over the year
telling i the trouble with the
environmental lobby be that we do not
understand the fundamental truth that
politics be perception
this be a
bad time to develop ignorance

you be making way too much of this

be i
this be you time sydney
you be sitting at the grownup
table
you have a chance to get
everything you want run a national
campaign be a major player inside
the party
but this relationship have
well go all the way because with
the leader of the free world there be
no halfway
politics be perception
and if thing do not work out the
amount of time it will take you to go
from be a hire gun to a cocktail
party joke can be clock with an egg
timer

leo there be no relationship

weapon section of the crime bill

catastrophe written all over it
please mr
president do not pursue
i outside the political arena

well i have no intention of pursue
you inside the political arena so
that leaf everything out and
that be unacceptable to i

if i be on you staff i would tell
you that the absolute bad thing you
can do coming into an election year
be to open yourself up to character
attack and the fast way to do
that be to prance around like the
playboy of the western world

let we clear up a couple of thing
number
i seldom prance
number
i have no intention of
engaging in a character debate and
number
you be not on i staff

yes of course but if you will follow
the immutable

why be that by the way

why be that

why be not you on i staff

you can not afford i

how much do you make

more than you do mr
president

the name andy
how much money do
you make

what the hell do it matter how
much money i

you would raise you voice to the
president

i be only think about the health
of you presidency
you think this
morning press conference be the
end of it
bob Rumsons get to be
drool over this

be you attracted to i

i beg you pardon

i ask if

that be not the issue

well i tell you what
let we make
it the issue
let we try something
new because i know that most couple
when they be first get together
be incline to slam on the brake
because they be concern about bob
Rumsons drool

you be not most people

you know what you problem be

what be i problem

sex and nervousness

sex and nervousness be i problem

yes
last night when we be
looking at the different place
setting in the dish room i
realized that those place setting
be provide by the first lady
and i will bet none of those first
lady be nervous about have
sex with they president husband

to i

because they be not
president when they meet they

large closet on you left
and if
you feel comfortable hang up you
coat and when you come back i will
have fixed up a drink we will sit on
the couch and i will explain to
you i plan

you have a plan
do not make i
wait
you be on a roll

okay
you be attracted to i but
the idea of physical intimacy be
uncomfortable because you only know
i as the president
it be not always
going to be that way and the reason i
know that be because there be a
moment last night when you be with
i and not the president and i know
what a big step that be for you
so sydney i be in no rush
here
i plan
we be going to slow down
when you be comfortable that be
when it will happen

perhaps i do not properly explain
the fundamental of the slow down
plan

you explain it great

be you nervous

no

good
i nervousness exist on
several level
number and
this be in no particular order
i have not do this in a pretty
long time
number

mr
president as of this morning
sydney only needed one more vote
the motown three have get to be
scare blind
i do not think there
be a good opportunity

the press be expect an
announcement on the crime bill by
the sate of the union

if you agree to stick in a drawer
until after the election they will
give you the three vote

and we declare victory sir

we said as a last resort

we be there sir
the state of the
union be hour away

no
come on
there be get to be three
vote someplace else

there be not

bullshit leon

mr

do it

she be one vote away

it be
important legislation that for the
first time have a legitimate chance
i think she deserve every possible
opportunity to

she
you mean it do not you
sir
you mean the important
legislation deserve every
opportunity


lewis shut up

you get something to say to i

respectfully sir
i think we should
examine the new poll for more than
it value as a box score

examine what
they do not like that
i be going out with sydney

it be not that simple sir
i think
this poll help bribg a murky problem
into specific relief

whose problem we talking about
lewis
yours
you worried about
you job
this poll be not talking
about i presidency
this poll be
talking about i life
two hundred
and sixtyfour million people have
decided

mr
president two hundred and sixty
four million people do not give a damn
about you life
they give a damn about
they own


all right that be enough

mr
president you have raised a
daughter almost entirely on you own
and she be terrific
what do it say
to you that in the last seven week
percent of this country have begin
to question you family value


the president do not answer to you
lewis

oh yes he do

i be a citizen
this be i president and in this
country it be not only permissible to
question we leader it be we
responsibility
but you already know
that mr
president because you have
a deep love of this country than
any man i have ever known and i want
to know what it say to you that in
the past seven week percent of
american have begin to question you
patriotism

look if people want to listen to bob
Rumson

they do not have a choice
rob
Rumsons the only one do the
talking
people want leadership
and in the absence of genuine
leadership they will listen to
anyone who step up to the
microphone
they want leadership
mr
president
they be so thirsty
for it they will crawl through the
desert toward a mirage and when
they discover there be no water
they will drink the sand

lewis we have have president who be
beloved who could not find a coherent
sentence with two hand and a
flashlight
people do not drink the
sand because they be thirsty lewis
they drink it because they do not know
the difference

continue

way out

apologize for i attitude toward you

attitude

hostility

very damage and costly bill

this well twice especially since
i have lost all credibility in politics
but you never know i might just be
able to pull it off again
i might
be able to give you just the leverage
you need to pass some groundbreaking
piece of crime legislation like a
mandatory threeday waiting period
before a fiveyearold can buy an uzi
fuck the sweater she will have to
learn to live with disappointment

dad i be perfectly

you be not perfectly happy
you
do not think i know when something
bother you

Damnit dad

you know

yes
sometimes i mean
i be not sure

like okay for instance i be
not so sure it be all right to burn a

i hear senator

dad
hate this guy
why be i agree with he and then
i think well maybe i be not really
like bob Rumson but maybe i be not
like dad either
but the point be
i be the president kid and people
pay attention to what i say and if
i say something different from what
you say it will be embarrass for
you
so i can not just get up in social
study class and say whatever i want

stand up please

i want you to pay very close
attention to what happen now

in you lifetime you will never
embarrass i
it could never happen

everything else be a distant second
school be for you lucy
you say
what you want
the only thing you
have to do to make i happy be
come home at the end of the day

one more thing
i do not dislike
senator Rumson because of he
political view
and even if you
vote for everything he would vote
for that would not make you like he
there be a fundamental difference
the world

what be that

the difference be that he say he
love america
say you love
america be easy
what take
character and this be what you
have

what take character be love
american

question about be a member of
the american civil liberty union

morning

good morning mr
president

that be all right you can keep you
seat
for the last couple of
month senator Rumson have suggested
that be president of this country
be to a certain extent about
character

lewis
call

and come on down
here
i do not know but
something happening

and although i have not be
will to engage in he attack on
i i have be here three year and
three day and i can tell you
without hesitation
be president
of this country be entirely about
character

for the record
yes i be a card
carrying member of the


you
but
the more important question be why
be not you bob
this be an
organization whose sole purpose be to
defend the bill of right so it
naturally beg the question

why would a senator he party most
powerful spokesman and a candidate
for president choose to reject
uphold the constitution
if you
can answer that question then
folk you be smart than i be
because i do not understand it until
a couple of minute ago
everybody
know american be not easy
america be
advance citizenship

you get to want it bad because it be
going to put up a fight
it be going to
say you want free speech
let we
see you acknowledge a man whose word
make you blood boil who be standing
center stage and advocate at the
top of he lung that which you
would spend a lifetime opposing at the
top of yours
you want to claim
this land as the land of the free
then the symbol of you country can not
just be a flag
the symbol also have
to be one of it citizen exercise
he right to burn that flag in
protest
show i that defend that
celebrate that in you classroom
then you can stand up and sing about
the land of the free
i have known bob
Rumson for year
i have be operating
under the assumption that the reason
bob devote so much time and energy to
shouting at the rain be that he simply
do not get it
well i be wrong

bob problem be not that he do not
get it
bob problem be that he
can not sell it
nobody have ever win
an election by talking about what i
be just talking about

this be a country make up of people
with hard job that they be terrify
of losing
the root of freedom be
of little or no interest to they at
the moment
we be a nation afraid
to go out at night
we be a society
that have assign low priority to
education and have look the other
way while we public school have
be decimate
we have serious
problem to solve and we need
serious man to solve they
and
whatever you particular problem be
friend i promise you bob Rumson be
not the least bit interest in
solving it
he be interest in two
thing and two thing only
making
you afraid of it and telling you
who be to blame for it
that lady
and gentleman be how you win
election
you gather a group of
middleage middleclass middle
income voter who remember with
longing an easy time and you talk
to they about family and american
value and personal character
then
you have an old photo of the
president girlfriend
you scream
about patriotism and you tell they
she be to blame for they lot in life
you go on television and you call she
a whore
sydney ellen wade have do
nothing to you bob
she have do
nothing but put herself through law
school prosecute criminal for five
year represent the interest of
public school teacher for two year
and lobby for the safety of we
natural resource
