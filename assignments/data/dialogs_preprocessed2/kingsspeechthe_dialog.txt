happy but the family the church the
nation will not have it

can not they fornicate privately like adult

i make a smudge

touch it up

you want i to beg for help

i advise you never to beg
especially if
you might be king

upon a course of therapy in which you have
no faith

bertie take a coin out of he pocket hesitate then offer it
to logue

i bring it along
you win fair and

i would apologize to they in person but

it may be even more
difficult
to remain unobserved

you be have second thought
berties silence be confirmation

i ask too many question

perhaps the wrong sort

we live in south kensington small
apartment but no one would see you
lots of plane

you know lionel you be the first ordinary
englishman

TKSSeidler
on the balcony of the castle decorated with black bunting be a
huge microphone and array in front of it a row of
uniformed dignitary wearing naval hat of the napoleonic war
replete with ostrich feather
one of the dignitary read a declaration

whereas it have please almighty god to call
to he mercy we late sovereign king
george the fifth of bless and glorious
memory
during this to the showing a massive
military parade mainly navy personnel wend it way through
the main street of windsor towards the castle accompanying a
gun carriage on which ride the kings coffin draped with the
royal standard on which rest the royal crown top by a
maltese cross
david be see very serious

that the high and mighty prince edward
albert christian george andrew patrick
david be now become we only lawful king
canon be fired
startle by the salute a large flock of blackbird rise up and
streak across the wintery sky
then a shock as the gun carriage transverses a
tram track and tilt precipitously
suddenly the royal crown
tumble and fall knocking off the maltese cross



oh bloody hell



bad omen you grace
the archbishop and churchill be watch the event from the
shadow at one end of the balcony
below a scramble to restore the cross to the crown and
replace both atop the coffin

do not be disingenuous
for we late king
crown to fall from he coffin be not a
fortuitous portent
what ever be going to
happen next
TKSSeidler

be that be the motto of the new reign
indeed will there actually be a new
reign

winston
i be deeply shock

you do not look it

i function require i to appear serene

that may be increasingly difficult to
maintain
i have be informed by no less an
authority than the prime minister that we
populace have no objection to royal
fornication but will never tolerate
adultery

well since we cannot acquire a new
populace perhaps we need a new king

i turn to be profoundly shock
neither look the slight traumatized

scoff churchill
go on
scoff
but you
more than other know full well we will soon
be under siege from the force of darkness

the wind of war
a gather storm

and who
would you suggest to rally the troop the
nation the empire the world
to bertie in the funeral cortege looking frail and
pale

man who cannot speak
in nuremberg
stadium herr hitler mesmerize millions
whilst the duke of york cannot successfully
order fish and chip
TKSSeidler

would you prefer the next brother

bisexual former drug addict
the
unwashed moralistic populace will adore
that

the young perhaps

now there be dimness

i must admit
unburden with brain

thus we be left with david the rightful
heir who speak beautifully even if he
talk nonsense

come let we bury one king before we
attempt to bring another to he knee

relative of lady macbeth

i would disremember at i peril

possible solution have be put to the
dominion prime minister

TKSSeidler

australia
no

david feel there be not that many people
in australia

canada

union of south africa
an
inappropriate marriage would create a
permanent wound
the irish free state
state it be not really they affair and
bluntly we english king may marry any
whore he want they will be well out of it

bloody irish

new zealand
waver

ah the kiwi

be rather remote they have not even hear
of mrs simpson
hardly a win hand

this be not about true love winston
this
be about who be in charge
do the king do
what he want or what he people want he
to do
do the king own he nation or
do the nation own they monarch

he will not budge

nor will we

TKSSeidler

good of you to see i at this late hour

jockey out of the throne


good lord
i brother write that

wallis write it for he
i will burn it
i
fear you brother be like the child in a
fairy story given everything in the world
but they forget he soul
quite happy to
bring he nation to the brink of civil war
just as we face global conflict

we be not coming to that

oh there be war alright

of paper
you brother held conversation with the
duke of SaxeCoburg you cousin a rank
member of the nazi party
i have the
scotland yard intercept
who be king here
baldwin or i
i myself wish to talk with
hitler and will do so here or in germany

i doubt england be ready to return to
absolute monarchy

surely he motive be misunderstood

if i do not get i way when the war come
hitler will crush everyone including the
american
the british may not want i as
they king but i will soon be back as they
leader
he intent seem crystal clear

winston

TKSSeidler

mug for he cancelled coronation will soon

you be will to go along with this
change horse in midstream be a perilous
maneuver

depend how badly the horse you be on
stumble

it be not too late winston you could form
a government on he behalf

i must decline
reluctantly

sorry
i have written a new speech for he

i do not want to hear it
ever

it do have a rather nice turn of phrase





at long last i be able to say a few word
of i own
until now it have not be
constitutionally possible for i to speak
few hour ago i discharge i last duty
as king and emperor
TKSSeidler





now that i have be succeed by i
brother the duke of york i first word
must be to declare i allegiance to he

daddy who broke we rock horse

giant



this have be make less difficult to i by
the sure knowledge that i brother have one
matchless bless enjoy by so many of
you and not bestow on i a happy home
with he wife and child





i have find it impossible to carry the
heavy burden of responsibility and to
discharge i duty as king as i would wish
to do without the help and support of the
woman i love



we all have a new king
i wish he and you
he people happiness and prosperity with
all i heart
god bless you all
god save
the king

wonderful lass
someone i can talk to
heart to heart

ordinary bloke

lionel

job a
husband a home

living in the royal gild cage
then i
realized

i have spread i dream under you foot
tread softly because you tread on i
dream

silence

anna nod earnestly

thank you
lionel
she exit via the waiting room and almost run into bertie
on
recognize he she bob she head

that be lovely

i would be honoured
she dash off
logue come to the door of the waiting room in effect blocking
berties way in

johnson be not it
have you an appointment

want i to beg

i told you king do not beg

i believe this time a bit of begging might
be required
elizabeth say i must eat
humble crow

it crow or humble pie
take you pick
TKSSeidler

i be frighten and take refuge in be
royal
what i said be unforgivable
and

and

what be the one essential thing a king must
do
he must believe he be king
how can i
possibly do that
for pity sake lionel i
beg you
get i through
i will pay you
another shilling

what be friend for

i would not know



i have get the boy sort they thing
you office will be a chore



we ask to see you highness because
there be the urgent question of what to call
you brother
aside from the obvious
TKSSeidler

what do you suggest

mr
edward windsor
all he deserve

what have i brother given up on his
abdication other than the throne
they look at each other unsure

would not it be a good idea to find out
before coming to i
he cannot be mister
as he be born the son of a duke
which
make he a lord at the very least

very well lord

it be

and as a lord of the realm he be entitled
to be elected to the house of commons
heading a kings party

unacceptable

so you prefer he take a seat in the house
of lords
again on behalf of a king
party
be that acceptable

certainly not

but if he be make a royal duke and called
he royal highness he cannot stand for
parliament
nor may he speak or vote in the
house of lords

oh i say

the duke of windsor it be
gentleman
he exit abruptly
churchill and lang gather they thing stun
TKSSeidler

not exactly a dummy be he












let we go gathering hearty heather with the
gay brigade of grand dragon

rescue

little wave

piece of cake
please assume a supine position on the
floor

firm support be needed
TKSSeidler
bertie dutifully lie on the floor

breathe deeply
expand you chest
now
you stomach
deep into the diaphragm
splendid
how do you feel

full of hot air

well on you way to becoming a qualify
political speaker
again
bertie inhale deeply

and hold
now princess elizabeth be
so kind as to sit on you husband
stomach

there be
poor coordination between you larynx and
diaphragm
princess elizabeth you can be
the official timer

vowel sound
shout at an open window
on
a public street

anyone who can stand at an open window
vibrating loudly in full view of the world
can learn to give a public speech

they can also be considered quite dotty
do not even contemplate it

uuuuuuuuuuu


TKSSeidler

may we be excused

no
the unhappy meal continue

we do not want to hear you fight

we be not fighting
you mother be not
talking

you wish i to speak i mind

boy leave

thank you dad
thank you mum
they exit hurriedly

lionel
without warn i arrive home to
find the queen in i parlour

duchess she have not be crown yet

lionel do not quibble

Whatd you think of she

do it matter
she be the queen and he be
the king forgodsake
what be they do
here

Whyd you come home so early

lionel

they come for help
TKSSeidler

what role be you audition for now
royal saviour
who be going to help we
this will bring we down lionel
you know
it will

when that poor chap first walk into i
office he be a slim quiet man with tire
eye and all the outward symptom of the
person upon whom a habitual speech defect
have set the sign
you see he today
once
more there be hope

you be not listening to i
she get up angrily and start carrying dish to the kitchen
he follow she back and forth

myrtle i love you

you say that but you do not listen when i
say in so many way how desperately i
want to go home how i never ever
intended to stay here
this be to be a
holiday trip to see mother england and
you turned it into quite something else
what happen lionel
we go to wembley
stadium next thing
you would cash in we
ticket
he be silent

very well i shall not talk of this ever
again
i will as always be supportive of
you endeavour

myrtle
i do not deserve a wonderful woman
like you

how right you be

but why you come home so early

lionel
i be let go
TKSSeidler

inquiry be make
mr Falkoff would not
say who
afterwards it be
with you
hubby treat a personage that high and
mighty you will not be need employment
with we will you mrs logue


why

they be frighten lionel
of what seem
so far above they
i sympathize
i be
frighten too

oh myrtle
i love




winston you do read the newspaper



only the vulgar one

to we new king

let we sincerely hope

be this a slightly pregnant pause
TKSSeidler

they say he be dim

demonstrably untrue

they say he have epilepsy

patently erroneous

fragile prone to illness

some correctness in that

and will die prematurely
they predict
he will be unable to complete the coronation

what do you propose
shorten the ceremony
or no ceremony at all

i idea exactly

i believe so
but what we need be a
pageant of pomp and pomposity to impress
the world

what we need and what we will get may be
two rather different thing
do you hear
he pathetic attempt at the accession
council
he will never be able to speak in
public

so we plonk a tinsel crown on he head and
lock he in a closet
who then will
spiritually lead this great nation into
war
who will address the far flung corner
of the empire rally all to we defense

well

the head of we church
be that what you
have in mind
TKSSeidler

would it be such a calamity

best ask we new king
bertie have enter with logue
lang spin around

you majesty

excuse i sir duty call
he exit quickly
cosmo continue nervously as they walk
through the abbey the archbishop pointing out the preparation
in progress particularly a booth for broadcaster

be this the scene of the crime

what a peculiar thing to say

refer to i assault upon the ear of
the listener

ah yes wireless be indeed a Pandoras
box
i have however categorically said no
to the bbcs new radiowithpictures
gadget
imagine the unwashed view we as
we blow we nose or scratch we bottom

radio with picture

it be called
television
happily with
a transmission range of only fifteen mile
this thing have no future
we shall
however be forced to permit cinema
the
product of which i shall personally edit

Thatll keep you busy remove all i
stop and start

unless of course you would prefer a quiet
ceremony
TKSSeidler

what exactly do you mean

something
discreet
private
we could
prerecord an edit version to be
broadcast to the world
or even find an
actor with a similar voice
logue have arrive and come out of the shadow

king base upon deception
cosmo take bertie aside

if you gentleman from security would give
we space we could discuss this in private

you mean i bodyguard crusher

give lionel a scathing look lang continue speaking to bertie
confidentially

fret not
as i assured we nation in i
recent broadcast
when he people listen
to they new monarch they will note an
occasional momentary hesitation in his
speech
but to those who hear it it need
because no sort of embarrassment for it
cause none to he who speak
you see
i have pave the way
but should you wish to
avoid far stress

why not paint he pink and cover he with
sequin

pardon

if you wish to call attention to his
anxiety

do you bodyguard know to whom he be
speaking
he certainly do not know his
place
TKSSeidler

doctor lionel logue i speech therapist

therapist
i would no idea
have i known you
majesty be seeking assistance i would have
make i own recommendation

dr
logue be to be present at the
coronation

impossibly to find room
even for a doctor

just lionel

behind the chair of edward the confessor

the royal box
you family will be seated
there

which make it most suitable

perhaps i might be able to add a very small
stool

two comfortable chair
one for madam
logue
she be a close friend of i wife
the
queen

i will have someone attend to it

and now if you do not mind we need the
premise

i dear fellow this be westminster abbey
the church must make preparation

so must bertie

bertie
we do not call the king
bertie
TKSSeidler

i do
during waking hour we will need the
facility
it will be a close set
no
observer

those be i wish you grace
lang nod curtly and exit

you have make a dangerous enemy

would not want he as a friend

and do not ever call i bertie in public
moment of confrontation
lionel know he be overstep

tell i

i sense one of you dreadful question on
the horizon

do you really want to be king

know it
i have not any choice

you can be a wound king who stumble
through he coronation
or as the arch of
so archly suggest no coronation at all
always a choice

what be this you wait til westminster
abbey then ambush i

i be simply asking question
which you
seem unable to answer

i be a sacrificial lamb be lead to
slaughter
damn you
TKSSeidler

quite possibly
but at least i know what i
want
you have not the foggy

i
he word reverberate through the empty abbey

that be quite different
let we get down to
work then shall we
bertie glare at he

as soon as you and elizabeth enter the west
door you will be greet with the hymn i
be glad when they say unto i
you will not
actually be that glad because they sing it
for a great long time
bertie follow logue deep into the bowel of the abbey

you will then show yourself to the various
side of the abbey as the archbishop
announce four time in a loud voice
sir i here present unto you
have you
decided you name for when you become king
for when you become a different person

george

TKSSeidler

TKSSeidler





in this grave hour perhaps the most
fateful in we history i send to every
household of i people both at home and
overseas







this message spoken with the same depth
of feel for each one of you as if i be
able to cross you threshold and speak to
you myself
for the second time in the
live of most of we we be at war
for we
be called with we ally to meet the
challenge of a principle which if it be
to prevail would be fatal to any civilized
order in the world
it be the principle
which permit a state in the selfish
pursuit of power to disregard it treaty
and it solemn pledge
which sanction the
use of force or threat of force against
the sovereignty and independence of other
states
such a principle stripped of all
disguise be surely the mere primitive
doctrine that might be right and if this
principle be established throughout the
world the freedom of we own country and
of the whole british commonwealth of
nation would be in danger
TKSSeidler



but far more than this the people of the
world would be keep in the bondage of fear
and all hope of settle peace and of the
security of justice and liberty among
nation would be end
this be the
ultimate issue which confront we

for the sake of all that we ourselves hold
dear and of the world order and peace
it be unthinkable that we should refuse to
meet the challenge
it be to this high
purpose that i now call i people at home
and i people across the sea who will
make we because they own
i ask they to
stand calm firm and united in this time
of trial
the task will be hard
there may
be dark day ahead and war can no longer
be confined to the battlefield
but we can
only do the right as we see the right and
reverently commit we because to god





if one and all we keep resolutely faithful
to it ready for whatever service or
sacrifice it may demand then with god
help we shall prevail


TKSSeidler

we may all find a message of encouragement
in the line which in i close word i
would like to say to you
i said to the
man who stand at the gate of the year
give i a light that i may tread safely
into the unknown
and he reply go out
into the darkness and put you hand into
the hand of god
that shall be to you
well than light and safe than a known
way
may the almighty hand guide and
uphold we all
the manager make a cut
gesture to bertie he be off the air the red light on the
microphone go out
the manager point and the red light on
the reader microphone go on

this conclude the broadcast of the
kings speech
another cut gesture from the floor manager the red light go
out and the transmission be conclude
the floor manager look
to the reader

he be not perfect
barely controlling he
tear
not perfect
but by god
he moved i
bertie wait for the verdict of he
peer
churchill first

could not have say it well myself
the ultimate compliment
lang next

i be speechless

thank god
she go to bertie and kiss he tenderly on the cheek take
he hand then Logues
TKSSeidler

well do bertie
well do
lionel
well do
she leaf the two man together

i always called you bertie
today i call
you king
he offer he hand
but instead of taking it bertie take he
by the shoulder and give he a hug
this be a long way from
the five pace rule
the last barrier have fallen
