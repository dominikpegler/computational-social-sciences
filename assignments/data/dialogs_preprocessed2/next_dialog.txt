the future be not what it used to
be
ever hear that expression



it be a joke but it be true
the
future change every time you look
at it

different



maybe just a little



and that change everything else



it be get something to do with
quantum physics
cris

millionth of an ounce to change a
roll

i have get other rule too
i do not
play against people like at poker
only against the house
v
o

and i goal be not to win big

no longshots
no
big bet except when i want em to
see i lose

try that one man
i have get a
feel
gambler
then you play it

against i religion

do it quick before somebody else
get there



mainly i stick to blackjack
bore
but controllable



and safe unless they think you be
count

cris
what do you want i to do
wait for
people to die

cris
i think you should move on
today

why
because i care so much about
kid that sometimes i overreact
ferris o
s

who be the woman
rick
liz cooper
nice girl but very
erratic
cAVANAUGH
think she will cooperate

hard to say
she be impossible to
control
ferris
sound like you have tried

she be quite a challenge

i swear i can not figure you out


believe i the feel be mutual

sometimes you seem mindlessly
impulsive
but other time i feel
like you be utterly calculating
saying exactly what you think
push i button

what do you mean

do not you think it be kind of an
amazing coincidence that neither of
we can have kid

you want to talk to i doctor
i will
get he on the phone
no really i
mean it
i will have he send you i
record
because i want you to
trust i

then open up
talk to i
where be
you going with you life
crIS
wherever it take i
liz
you never think about the future

all the time
but mainly how to
stay out of trouble

no goal
dream
ambition

there be only one thing i have ever
wanted

what be that


family

that be all
just a family

well i be as they say left on a
doorstep when i be two
never find foster parent who
could put up with i
so to i a
family sound like plenty

you have get to be making this up

i wish

you poor guy

i say we get the whole department
up here and bust he ass
ferris
and by that time he ass be
long go

then why will not he see through you
trap
ferris
let we try this one more time


i will meet you inside
i need to
pick something up at the drug
store

stay in the car
if he see you
shadow he will not take the bait
CaVANAUGH
we hear you
ferris
i be serious
this guy can smell
you fart before you even eat the
bean
rick
miss i will not even think about
bean
rick
sound like a crock to i

you have not be chasing he for
three year
ferris
miss cooper

yes


agent ferris

he be not a killer
he need help
ferris
i agree
but he have a long history
of resisting arrest and the state
want to hunt he down with fifty
triggerhappy cop

you be not going to let they

that be why i come to you

okay i will talk to he
i will try to
get he to

even he good friend say he will
never turn himself in
at this
stage there be only one way to keep
he from selfdestructing
crIS
what take so long

i run into a friend i have not see
in a while


she said we could use she cabin up
at the peak
caVANAUGH
do you tell she about the future
thing
ferris
of course not
i wanted she to
believe i
but i loaded she up
with liquor to dim he headlight

god this be gorgeous

what be wrong

nothing

baine
okay when you press the remote
the cabin will lock down like a big
jail cell

but silently right

unnoticeably

and that be when we go in
ferris
you still do not get it
this have to be clear to you whole
army
and yours
after she come out
and we lock down the cabin
we
do not do anything
we wait
policeman
but if he be already trapped

gentleman try to think like he

if the plan be to go in right after
he be trap he will see it coming
and he will slip away before he be
trapped
like he be always do
cavANAUGH
how do you plan change anything
baine
at least he will not hear it when the
trap close

and if he do not know he be
trapped he can not foresee knowing
he be trapped

that kinda make sense


the eureka moment be when he
realize he be be trapped

when be that
ferris
that be the point
we want to delay
eureka for as long as possible
so by the time he see trouble and
decide to waltz away
baine
he be already be in the trap for
hour

Voila

you be smart

cris
do you think we meet for a
reason

you mean do i believe a high
power bring we together

yeah

no
i think we be just the last in
a long chain of accident that
start with the big bang


that be not very romantic

oh but it be
think of it
for we
to meet everything from the very
beginning every subatomic event
every galactic cataclysm every
step of evolution every act every
accident every decision in the
history of the universe have to
happen exactly the way it do just
so you and i could be together
right here and now

to whatever happen next

i should not

why

i be late

late

that be why i go to the drug
store
to get a pregnancy test

you know what this means


i do now

how do it

i have no idea
unless
but that
still do not explain

liz i really do have this
problem
i be not lying to you

but this be good
this be amazing
i want this baby more than
anything

it be like a miracle

for both of we
baine
think she will come through


woman hate goodlooking man
reject they make we feel
powerful
baines
and that be more important than
love

and shoot five innocent people

you be afraid something bad might
happen so you

not might
those people die

if they catch i they will put i in
a cell without a trial and they will
never let i out

wisdom
how do you know it be prevision
maybe he be reading mind

no mind to read
the gun be
aim automatically by infrared
wisdom
what other trick can he do
ferris
please step into the next room

i be going
no need for a hotfoot
baine
the floor be electrify
he must
have tried resisting and foresee
the result
ferris on monitor
cris it be time to get start with
the next test
this will not be
unpleasant
we just need to you sit
in the chair

ferris on monitor
i want you to look ahead tell i
the time on the clock and then tell
i what film clip you see playing
let we start with five minute from
now
then we will press ahead as far
as you be capable of
the clip have be assembled at
random by a computer so nobody
know what will be playing next
cris
look i will stand here and tell you
what i see
ferris on monitor
i be afraid we need you to sit

why
ferris on monitor
why not

i know what happen
ferris oN
tell we

you tie i down and never let i
out
ferris
that be only because you will not
cooperate

because you be trying to force i

ferris
work with we cris and you can be
a hero
fight we and thing will
get bad and bad
ferris
now sit in the chair
one
two
three

whoa you be one tough bitch

we be still in a code red if i be
not mistake

he know he would get shock but he
choose to resist

he be almost never have to face
consequence
cris be you ready to get in the
chair

we need information right

leave he there
we will start again
when he recover


okay how do we use he to find the
bomb

simple
we make he watch the news
and tell we about it

how far ahead can he see

i do not know
but i suspect we can
increase he range with practice
especially if we restrict his
future to only watch news
then
he will be like a timescope

you be right
this be huge

this be just for starter
you want
to stage a preemptive strike he
can tell you if you will hit the
target and whether they hit back
and what go wrong
and you can do
this over and over until you get it
perfect before you begin
wisdom
and all he be ever do with it be a
little gamble and security
fraud
ferris
i know it be amazing
but he be not
ambitious
wisdom
damn how will we control this guy
when he figure out what he be
capable of

ferris
we control he now
we just have to
keep it that way

right now sweetheart we can not
even get he to sit in a chair

we have get to think this through
you friend could be more dangerous
than the terrorist
ferris
be not you running ahead of
yourself

with this guy you have to
or
it will be over before it begin
ferris
so we will keep he in chain

that may not be enough
we may
have to cut off he arm and leg
then i might start to feel safe
ferris
you be not serious

think about it
what we be talking
about here be the next step in
human evolution
and i be not going to
make the same mistake the
neanderthals make when they run
across this goodlooking homo
Sapien fellow and all the lady
neanderthals said he be so cute
let we keep he around


can we deal with you sexual
insecurity at another time


you mean after it be too late
ferris
i wish you would given i a chance to
chain he up before you decided to
prune he into a stump
wisdom
you think he know
already
wisdom
i have not make any firm decision
maybe we will just keep he tied
up

i told you he do not read mind
he see the result
wisdom

and
bring a dozen man


wait for i signal then go in and
