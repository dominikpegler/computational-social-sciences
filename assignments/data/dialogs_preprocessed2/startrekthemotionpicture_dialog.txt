one and
together

continue
sadly
this consciousness which call
it stir you human half spock
you have not achieve Kolinahr
you human emotion be not fully

he will not achieve he goal with

he answer lie elsewhere

















commander Sonak


you have received you appointment
as enterprise science officer

base i be tell on you
recommendation admiral
thank
you

why be not you on board

captain decker request i complete
final science brief here before

here at starfleet
the
enterprise be in final preparation
to leave dock

which will require twenty more
hour at minimum admiral

twelve
i be on i way to a meet
with admiral Nogura which will not
last more than three minute
report to i on the enterprise in
one hour

to you sir

i intend to be there follow
that meet
report to i
one
hour







admiral i have be hope to see
you
maybe you can get through
to those thick head in starfleet
that

why be not the enterprise
transporter in operation mister
scott

we be hope it be only a temporary
problem admiral

see that it be
take i over please

admiral the enterprise have just
finished eighteen month redesign
ing and refitting
she need
testing a shakedown

mr
scott there be an alien object
with unbelievable destructive
power less than three day away
from this planet

the only starship in
interception range be the
enterprise
ready or not she
launch in twelve hour






as it move way from the office complex
we can



the crew have not have near enough
transition time with all the new
equipment
and the engine
admiral
they have yet to be even
tested at warp power
add to
that an untried captain

two and a half year as chief of
starfleet operation may have
make i a little stale mr
scott
but i would not exactly consider
myself untried


they give she back to i scotty

give she back sir
i doubt
it be that easy
but any man who could manage such
a feat i wouldna dare disappoint
she will launch on time sir
and she will be ready























permission to come aboard sir

grant sir
welcome aboard
admiral
commander scott
you be needed in engineering
immediately

sir you will excuse i



sir if you will follow i i will

i think i can find i way
ensign





bridge





captain
starfleet just
signale you transferof
command order


i appreciate the welcome
i wish
the circumstance be less
critical
epsilon nine be monitor the
intruder
keep a channel open to
they
where be captain decker

he be in engineering sir
uncomfortable
indicate captain
chair
he do not know

mr chekov assemble the crew on
the rec deck at hour
i
want to show they what we be
facing

i would not have wanted to have
be standing in he way
he
wanted she back
he get she

and captain decker
he be be
with the ship every minute of
she refit

ensign we chance of coming
back from this mission in one
piece may have just double







i think so
see
the tran
porter sensor be not activate

aye you be dead right about
that
clearly put a backup sensor into
the unit


admiral kirk
we be get a top brass send
off
she will launch on schedule if we
have to tow she out with we bare
hand
right scotty

aye sir that we will

will let we go over here and
talk

let i now when the backup be
in place



all due respect sir i hope
this be not a starfleet pep talk
i be just too busy

i be taking over the center seat
i be sorry will

you be what

i be replace you as captain of
the enterprise

you will stay aboard as executive
officer
a temporary grade
reduction to commander

you personally be assuming
command

yes

may i ask why

i experience five year out
there dealing with unknown like
this i familiarity with the
enterprise this crew

admiral this be an almost totally
new enterprise
you do not know
she a tenth as well as i do




that be why you be staying aboard
i be sorry will

no admiral
i do not think you be
not one damn bit
i remember
when you recommended i for this
command
you told i how envious
you be and if only you could
find a way to get a starship
command again
well sir it look
like you find a way

report to the bridge commander
immediately

transporter room come in
urgent
redline on the transporter
mister scott

transporter room do not engage
do not

react to the read
interruption
too late
they be beam now



starfleet override we

yank they back

unable to retrieve they pattern
enterprise

we be losing the pattern

starfleet boost you matter gain
we need more signal

oh no
they be form


oh i god


starfleet do you have they

enterprise
what we get back
do not live long
fortunately

starfleet
kirk
please
express i condolence to they
family
commander Sonaks
can be reach through the vulcan
embassy
see rands stricken
expression
there be nothing you could have
do rand
it be not you fault



Turboshaft eight

back that way sir


we will have to replace commander
Sonak
i would still like a vulcan
there if possible

none available captain
there be
no one in fact who be fully rated
on this design

you be mister decker
i be
afraid you will have to double as
science officer
and kirk move on decker stand gazing reflectively
after he









that be all we know about it
except that it be now
day
from earth
enterprise be the
only federation starship that
stand in it way




we assume there be a vessel of
some type at the heart of the
cloud
we order be to intercept
investigate
and take whatever action
be necessary
and possible
we can only hope that the
life form aboard that vessel
reason as we do

they seem to be react to

formally
rise
welcome aboard lieutenant


hello ilia

decker

i be station on the lieutenant
home planet some year ago

eye he rank

we exec and science officer

captain kirk have the utmost
confidence in i

and in you too lieutenant

i oath of celibacy be on record
captain
may i assume i duty

by all means


captain starfleet report we
last six crew member ready to
beam up
but one of they be refuse
to step into the transporter

oh
i will see that he beam up

mr
sulu take lieutenant ilia
in hand

sir
yes of course
you preprogramming be already
set in lieutenant

i be sworn to celibacy mister
sulu
that make i as safe

al insult

i would never take advantage of
a sexually immature species
you can assure he that be true
can not you





yeoman what be the problem
down there

he insist we go first sir
say something about first seeing
how it scrambled we molecule

thank you yeoman
starfleet this be captain kirk
the officer be to be beamed up
immediately


well for a man who swear he would
never return to starfleet
McCOY
what happen captain sir be
that you rever admiral Nogura
invoke a little known and
seldom used reserve activation
clause
in simple language captain
sir they drafted i

they do not
McCOY
this be you idea
it be
you idea be not it

bone there be a thing out
there
McCOY
why be any object we do not
understand called a thing

headed this way
i need you
McCOY
be you behind this

bone i need you badly
McCOY
permission to come aboard sir

permission grant sir
McCOY
i hear chapel an now
i
need a top nurse not a doctor
who will argue every diagnosis
and
McCOY
they have probably redesign
sickbay too

in order to intercept the

warp drive while still within the
solar system


captain assuming we have full
warp capability accelerating to
warp seven on leaving solar system
will bring we to with the
intruder in twenty point one hour


science officer computation
confirm sir


well bone do the new medical
facility meet with you
approval
McCOY
they do not
it be like work
in a damn computer center

program ready

program set for standard warp
entry captain

but i still recommend
**further/far simulation study

mister decker
every minute
bring that object near earth
engineering
stand by for
warp drive

captain we need far warp
simulation on the flow sensor

engineer we need warp speed now
McCOY
you be pushing jim
you people
know they job



hold one minute please captain

that be it sir
i can not do any
well

aye lad
it be borderline on the simulator

in just a second exec
we be
picking up the piece down here

mr
scott

captain it be we antimatter
imbalance that created the
wormhole in the first place
it
will happen again if we do not
correct it

that object out there be less
than two day from earth mister
scott
we have get to intercept
while it still be out there

aye we understand that sir
we be do we good

mr
decker i would like to see you
in i quarter
you have the conn mr
sulu
McCOY
mind if i tag along


maintain warp point

i show we new head
as point three mark

continue
gently
remind
lieutenant ilia

a beat
then
quickly
confirm mr
sulu
confirm



explanation mr
decker
why be
i phaser order countermand

sir the enterprise redesign
increase phaser power by
channeling it through the main
engine
when they go into
antimatter imbalance the
phasers be automatically cut
off

then you act properly of course

thank you sir
i be sorry i embar
rassed you

you saved the ship

i be aware of that sir

stop competing with i decker

permission to speak freely sir

grant

sir you have not log a single
star hour in two and a half year
that plus you unfamiliarity
with the ship design in i
opinion sir seriously jeopardize
we mission

i trust you will
nursemaid i
through these difficulty mister

yes sir i will do that

then i will not keep you from you
duty any long commander
yes doctor
McCOY
he may not be wrong jim






be he difficult

no more than i expect
not as difficult as this
i be
sorry

that you left
or that you do not
say goodbye

if i would see you again would you
have be able to say it

long hesitation
then shake head
no


McCOY

get out of here bone
McCOY
as ship doctor i be now
discuss the subject of
command fitness

make you point doctor
McCOY
the point captain be that it be
you who be competing
you pulled every string in the
book short of blackmail to get
the enterprise maybe even
that
and when this mission be
over you have no intention of
giving she back

i intend to keep she be that
what you be saying doctor
McCOY
it be an obsession that can
blind you so far more immediate
and critical responsibility
you reaction to decker be an
example

bridge to captain

very well mr

you
opinion have be noted
doctor
be there anything **further/far

you engine design difficulty

i offer i service as science

if we executive officer have no
objection

of course not
i be aware of
mister Spocks qualification

grinning openly now
turn call
mister chekov log mister Spocks

list he as science officer
both
effective immediately

appear
chapel

mr
spock
McCOY
so help i i be actually
please to see you

that be how we
all
feel mister

with you permission i will now
discuss these fuel equation with
the engineer

mister spock
welcome aboard
McCOY
never look a gift vulcan in the

captain log
Stardate

thanks to mr
Spocks timely
arrival and assistance


now in regulation uniform and hair trim
make



we have the engine rebalance
into full warp capacity
repair

sit down please

sir i would appreciate dr
mccoy
absent himself from this
interview

i want he here
sit down

you have report that you feel
strong thought emotion

group of mind from a space
vessel
could you make out any
plan anything to do with
earth

negative captain
i could sense
only what seem an almost
omniscient pattern of perfect
logic
i can explain nothing
more
i understand nothing more

also there be nothing in you
report about
why
you be here

that inquiry invade i personal
life captain
McCOY
spock we have already guess why
you be here

i inquire about you learned
you be study with the
master
McCOY
that flicker of emotion confirm
we guess
you failed

facing mccoy for
the first time
you deduction do you credit

if you puerile
curiosity do not
McCOY
and now

i still contain fragment of i

be i only hope of accomplish
what the master could not
McCOY
if you achieve perfect logic spock
you will pay a price
it be given
you planet
ten thousand year
of
peace but no poetries be written
since then no music

let it drop bone
you be i science officer i will
expect an
immediate
report on
anything **further/far you learn or
sense
from here on

i have accepted service here as

i know this have be painful spock

do those image repre

yes

carbon unit have clearly retarded
enterprise proper evolvement

what be enterprise proper
evolvement

enterprise should not require
the presence of carbon unit

enterprise would be unable to

carbon unit

more data concerning this function
be necessary before carbon unit can

what do that mean

stopping

the carbon unit will be reduced

McCOY
we be

and it consider the enterprise a

what do it think
we

McCOY
an infestation bacterium

they

sir

i want to make a ship announcement
but it be to be hear only in

this be the captain speaking
it
appear that the alien ship
ger
be a manned vessel


it be a live entity

life form
we be attempting to
ascertain it intention
all

by the creator

to join and become one with the

to learn all that be learnable
to deliver all collect data to
the creator on the third planet
that be the program


well sir now what about all that
live entity the captain say
entity
live thing

thank you scotty

you welcome sir

there be no logical reason for
carbon unit to control enterprise

the interference
appear to be a rather simple

sir


to decker
interrupt
as i stated ger call to the
creator

nod
turn to kirk
ger be announce that it have
arrive sir that it be ready
to deliver the information it
be programme to collect

to learn all that be learnable


it expect a return signal now
ordering it to transmit that
information to the creator

sir
ger signal have
stopped

decker
the creator have not
respond

pick up starfleet again
a

much more deadly
second

i god
they be the same kind
of thing that destroyed the

from

these read as identical composition
however captain they measure
several hundred time more
powerful

sulu

the third one be moving off too
a fourth one be form

urgent

captain
all
earth defense system have
go dead

sir starfleet compute they
trajectory as moving toward
equidistant position over earth


from four equidistant position
captain a detonation would blanket
the entire surface of the planet

i plot they as reaching equidistant
position in
twentynine
minute sir
mark


why

the carbonunits infection will
now be remove from the creator
planet

why

the creator have not answer

the carbonunits be not
responsible for that

you infest and control enterprise
ger believe carbonunits interfere
with the creator in the same manner

then ger believe the creator to
be a
machine
too

it seem we
all
imagine god in we
own image

fourth
object be

McCOY

similar life form

jim ger saying the creator
be a
machine

of course
we all create god
in we own image

ger
if we be lesser being
we be still like you living
and because we be alive we
like you wish to survive
you must not destroy

treat ger as you would

yes captain a child

not until ger withdraw the
device orbit the third planet





to ilia almost
pleasant
no
then to crew
commandingly
secure all station
clear
the bridge

bridge to all deck secure
you station
McCOY
you child be have a
tantrum spock

clear the bridge captain

that be the order mr
sulu
clear the bridge





leaving bridge
to captain
severe stress on engine pylon
sir

to kirk
flat
ger require the information

bridge secure all station
move out
McCOY
jim what the hell kind of
strategy be
this

all ship function going to
automatic captain


if ger destroy the enterprise
the information ger require
will also be destroyed


it be illogical to withhold
require information
dim
and now kirk look at

Kirkunit
why
do you not
disclose information

because ger be going to
destroy all the carbon unit
on the third planet

they have repressed the creator

the information will not be
disclosed

ger
need
the information


then ger must withdraw it
orbit device

ger will comply if the carbon
unit disclose the information
McCOY
McCOY
it learn fast do not it
McCOY

captain the vessel ger
obviously operate from a
central brain complex

the orbit device would be
controlled from the point
then

precisely

the carbon unit information
cannot be disclosed to ger
probe
only to ger directly

McCOY
indicate
viewer
jim


forward motion captain

tractor beam

captain what be the next move

the question be mr
decker
be
there a next move





resume duty station mr
decker

into intercom
voice amplify
all personnel resume station

well mr
decker it seem i
bluff be be called

i be afraid we hand be pretty
weak captain
but it be the only game in town

mr
chekov when do those device
activate

they reach final position in
Twentyseven minute mark

a beat
then into
intercom
engineering



scott here sir



into intercom
eye on ilia
mr
scott be prepared to execute
starfleet order two zero zero
five



with a glance at
ross into intercom
when captain

on i command

somberly into
intercom
aye sir

why have the captain ordered self
destruct sir

a beat
gently
i would say lass because he
think he hope that when
we go up
we will take ger
with we

will we

with grim
satisfaction
when that much matter and anti
matter be bring together
oh yes
we will indeed





twentyfive minute to device
activation sir





starfleet have be apprised of
we situation captain

tractor beam remains constant

we be seventeen kilometer inside
the vessel



spock
spock
McCOY



mr
spock i think
tear
welling fom the eye rolling down he cheek

not for we

no captain not for we
for ger

i weep for ger as i would for
a brother far more knowledgeable
than i and yet one step behind
McCOY

as i be when i come aboard
so be ger now
empty incomplete
search
logic and knowledge be
not enough
McCOY
spock be you saying that you
find what you needed but ger
have not

have not doctor and now because
of what we be planning
will not

there be no alternative

mr
spock what would ger need
to fulfill itself

ger have begin to understand the
true limit of we universe
thereby realize the existence
of other dimension
to fulfill
itself it must evolve to a
high dimension
ger believe
this can be achieve only by
joining with the creator

each of we at some time in we
life turn to someone a father
a brother a god and ask why
be i here
what be i mean
to be
ger hope to touch it
creator to find it answer


be this all that i be
be there
nothing more

captain
chamber
but the violent and color energy effect of

captain i believe that be we
destination





slow
kirk just resume he command chair as

forward motion slow captain

engineering
status mr
scott

we be ready sir

thank you scotty
stand by
McCOY






tractor beam strength lessen
captain

mr
scott
on i next signal

captain the orbital device will


not be trigger for twentytwo nineteen

minute
fifteen


the point

eie ilia
carefully
the point be captain
twentytwo


should
minute
we could have that much loop
more time




mr
spock if we do not provide
ger with certain information we
will not have twentytwo
second
the
plan must be implement upon arrival

captain we can not be sure that we
move
will actually save earth

no
stopped
at the same time

forward motion stopped captain

tractor beam be released





ger


into intercom
with finality
mr
scott


captain
i read an oxygen and
gravity envelope form outside
the enterprise

sir i have locate the source
of ger radio signal

directly ahead

that transmitter be a vital link
between ger and the creator



we have twentyone minute
captain

we can still save ger
and ourselves

the carbon unit will now provide
ger the require information


mr
scott
we be holding off
there may be a chance
rise gesture
spock and mccoy
spock bone


mr
decker
i will contact you
every five minute
otherwise
inform mr
scott immediately

captain
i would like to go along

mr
sulu you have the conn

ger plan to literally
meld
to reduce both itself and the
creator to pattern

and then to reassemble itself
combine
with the creator
the
most certain way of obtain
all the creator answer

we data be be prepared

answer

we will answer and present
proof
of we answer when it be ready

ger
we will bring the creator
to you
here


we need only a few more minute
believe
i


ilia believe i
the creator
will appear


enterprise to captain



problem captain
the response
signal be not in we record
voyager six be send out by earth
united states subdivision
the
code be probably



keep secret to keep voyager
data from rival subdivision
McCOY
that be preposterous
they
would not have keep
scientific
data from one another

we be now checking with starfleet
archives captain
stand by


and when ger melds
what will
happen to you

it will
take i from
you
McCOY
McCOY
and when it realize what the
creator be

there be no way to know
ger
expected it to be a machine
some single entity
indicate entire
site
all of we here may be reduced
into pattern

that seem to be what it have
planned to have the creator
physically present here
McCOY
the god it capture be going to
be a hell of a disappointment

McCOY

commander

continue
into communicator
kirk here

we now have the response code
sir

stand by
transmit it on i
order

enterprise
transmit


record
McCOY

enterprise be you transmitting

affirmative captain
for some
time now

confirm code and transmitting
frequency

both signal and frequency
confirm sir

captain kirk


the fault be here sir not in
the transmission
indicate into
hatch
the antenna lead have be
disconnect
ger never
intended to accept a transmit
signal

capture god
in order to
retrieve ger data the
creator have to physically come
here

and plug the signal directly into
the circuitry at this
indicate into
access
point here captain
it
should pick up even a tricorder
playback

enterprise i want that signal
again
transmit



jim
he
want
it

you get the enterprise it be
what
you
wanted
this be what
i want
but jim
i be
the right choice for this
mission

transparent
and the now expand in all
dissolve







McCOY
well it certainly have be
interesting

spock we
be
it answer

yes captain
it needed we
mortality the fear of it we
struggle against it we fear
we dream

and the foolish emotion
which drive we

look at kirk
then
i prefer you poet Dantes phrase
the divine restlessness of
the human spirit

McCOY
spock
you be quoting poetry

starfleet signal captain
return to orbital dockyard for
inspection

ignore that signal
shall we give the enterprise a
proper shakedown mr
scott

i would say it be time for that i
would sir
we can have you back on vulcan
in four day mr
spock

i have no business on vulcan
engineer

ahead warp one mr
sulu

head sir

taking center seat
indicate generally
out there
Thataway

most logical choice captain
