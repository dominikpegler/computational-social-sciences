the leader of the
pride
when he get on in year
it be just a matter of time before
some young male arrive on the scene

they go at it and
the old cat get the crap beaten
outta he
it be humiliating
in front
of all the female this go down
and after he be defeat he be cast
out of the pride to scavenge and
die alone in the bush

yeah nature get a real sick sense
of humor

no shit
it be fucking tragic because
the old lion can not figure it out on
he own
that he be past it
it would be
so much easy for he to just walk
away and save himself all that pain
and humiliation

that be like admitting to yourself
that you be already dead
