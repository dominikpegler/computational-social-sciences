qualified the disappearance as foul play

what evidence

for one thing there be no skid mark on
that bridge the tire be all intact
from what we could tell nothing wrong
internally with the vehicle either
like
the car have be driven off the bridge

flipping through
the report what hospital be you going
to
i mean the lodovico street bridge
be not exactly on the way to mercy
general

until we find the body itself
be there
any way you do not tell miss person
everything that happen just before that
accident

look i have be fully
cooperative
to i recollection


i be sorry mr

the fact that you be on very strong pain
medication you might not be remembering

fabrication you have make up about it

i be


at the dawning of the agrarian age
goat milk would be considered a
suitable substitute for a mother breast
milk
and the sacrifice of a goat would
appease an angry god and ensure a
bountiful harvest
but in time the ritual
would become associated with less
hallowed purpose

goat blood be say to hold supernatural
property linked to black magic


in conjunction with the pentangle the
five point star the spill of goat
blood be considered to be either an
aphrodisiac that can be used in demonic
orgy or a means by which a high priest
may summon satan himself

the book of revelation speak of the
antichrist as the beast with many eye
for century illustrator have chosen a
goat to represent this beast

city police main switchboard how may i
direct you call

you already ask i that ten minute ago
just before you put i on hold
i be
looking for defective i mean detective
lange

oh he and he partner just stepped out to
lunch can i


just open the door i will jump off

not while the bus be moving sir

where be i wife detective lange
what the
hell do you do with she


mr
gooding i assure you we be do
everything within we

why do you leave i that message

i do not know what you be talking about



basically they know where you wife
body be and they be not telling you as a
tactic to get you to confess
yet neither
of they have come out and told you that
you be a suspect
be that what you be
trying to say

look larry i know you never think too
much of i
and i know this all sound a
little fuck up

little
try unbelievably

i swear these guy be like playing
mindgame with i
i think they get a
hold of i email address at work too


trevor barring the more outrageous
aspect of you claim you be not the
only widower the police have question
when foul play be suspected

hey ninety five point three percent of
all murder be committed by either a
spouse a direct relative or a close
friend that be common knowledge
but this
be not murder it be an accident

and as far as hide a body go
i find
it hard to believe even the dirty of
cop would keep a victim remains hide
simply to get someone to confess
it be
absolutely preposterous
now i be not
saying i do not believe you
i be
ambiguous
there be quite alot of
money behind all this

how much do i stand to inherit if kirsty
be presume dead

rosie can you bring in the gooding
paper

right away mr
ellis

uh
ballpark would be fine larry

in the vicinity of eight million four
hundred fifty thousand
or be it sixty

what happen if i be convicted of Kirstys
murder

well they would have to prove it in a court
of law for one thing


please larry
pretend you like i and
humor i

seeing you be she sole benefactor and
i be the executive of the will Kirstys
entire estate would have to be donated to
the city

hello
city
cop
it be a fuck
conspiracy

pardon i glibness trevor but you sound
like a rave lunatic
the next time you
seek counsel it should be of the
psychiatric type
you be obviously on the
verge of some nervous collapse

thanks for you concern larry
and fuck
you too

way to move past something completely be
to go straight through it not around it
surrender yourself to you wife death
let it chew you up and spit you back out
on the other side
