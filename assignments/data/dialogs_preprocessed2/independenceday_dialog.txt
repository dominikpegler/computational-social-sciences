would i keep you
guy out of the loop

in a second

absolutely



at the moment we satellite be
somewhat unreliable
be not it
possible that thing may just pass
we by

what if it do not pass we by

let we retarget some icbm to blow
it out of the sky

forgive i but with the little
information we
do
thing that would accomplish be
turn one dangerous falling object
into many

what be the damage

the press be making up they own
story at this point

get on the horn with atlantic
command
let we upgrade the
situation to

that be not you call to make mr
Nimziki

be not that a little premature

i do not think so

we be two day away from the fourth
of july
we have over fifty percent
of we arm force on weekend leave
not to mention the troop and
commander wehave in town for the
fourth of Julyparade
we call they
back now we be sending up a major red
flag

we intelligence tell we the
object have settled into a
stationary orbit

well that be good news

not really

part of it have broken off into
nearly three dozen other piece

piece

small than the whole yet over
fifteen mile in width themselves

where be they heading

they should be enter we
atmosphere within the next twenty
five minute

like it or not we be at
recall the troop and put they on
yellow alert

what be the bad news

you be in meal penalty for
disturbing i lunch

and the good news be you will not
charge i

no
the good news be i find the
problem and it be not we
equipment
there be some weird
signal embedded within the
satellite feed

that be the
good

yes because the analog signal have
a definite sequential digital
pattern embedded within it
when
i find the exact binary sequence
and i apply a phase reversed
signal to that calculate spectrum
analyzer i build you last
christmas we should be able to
block out the overlay completely

and we will be the only guy in
town with a clear picture
that be
i man



russell
god damn it russell

just what the hell do you think

have a complete diagnostic run

excuse i sir radar may be
malfunction but infrared be off
the map

get the atlantic command on
the line


sir we now have visual range with
incoming over iraqi airspace

second sight

yes sir this just come in from
the eisenhower

correction we have
two
visual contact
one over iraq
one over the pacific

where in the pacific
they have spotted one off the
california coast line

put it on

sighting of this atmospheric
phenomenon have be report here
in novosibirsk russia and other
part of siberia
moving too
slowly to be a comet or meteor
astronomer be baffled as to it
origin

widespread panic have grip
the countryside as thousands have
taken to the street and clog
the highway
hundreds have be
injure

mr
president we have an on
the west coast



with
contact point three minute

it be no use
side radar do not
see a thing

that be correct
we be blind
sir

negative
we still have
zero
visibility

instrumentation be malfunction
we can not get any kind of read
on what be in front of we

wait a minute it may be clearing


jesus god
the sky on fire

get they back on line

line go sir

two more have be spotted over
the atlantic
one be moving
toward new york the other be
headed this direction

how much time do we have

less than ten minute

organize a military escort to
crystal mountain

sir i strongly recommend we
move you to a secure location
immediately

can we expect the same kid of
panic here as in russia

more than likely

mr
president you can discuss
this on the way

i be not leaving

we must maintain a work
government in a time of crisis

i want the vice president
secretary of defense the whole
cabinet and the joint chief taken
to a secure location
i be staying here
i be
not
to add to a public hysteria that
could cost live

but mr

so far these thing have not
become hostile
for the moment
let we assume they will not
connie let we issue statement
advise people not to panic to
stay home and take cover

with you permission mr

you side

i have a feel you would

sir what happen if they
do
become hostile

then god help we

pattern
we
can

huh
oh good hood

strange thing be if i
calculation be right it will be
go in approximately seven hour
anyway
the signal reduce itself
every time it recycle
eventually it will disappear
be
you listening

still glue to


can you believe this

what re you talking about

have not you be watch

so far the phenomenon have not
cause any damage
in all
likelihood it will not

everyone should remain calm
take cover where you can but the
important thing be not to panic

we have a fix on three
different occurrence about to

if you wanted t coordinate
with ship all over the world you
could not send one signal to every
place at the same time
that be
called line of sight

you would need to relay you signal
use satellite

to reach each ship
i have
find a signal hidden inside we
own satellite network

excuse i mr
president
they be
start

mr

satellite
we have lost all
satellite communication tracking
and map

have relay intelligence to
we on board computer

we have moved as many of we force
away from the base as possible
but we have already sustained heavy
loss

i speak with the joint chief when
they arrive at
they
agree we must launch a counter
offensive with a full nuclear
strike
hit they with everything
we have get

above american soil

if we do not strike soon there may
not be much of an america left to
defend

what be the late from

it be go sir
they have taken out


that be impossible

i god the vice president and the
joint chief

mr
president we must launch

delay now would be more costly
than when you wait to evacuate
the city

you can not be seriously consider
firing nuclear weapon

david do not

if you fire nuke so will the
rest of the world
do you know
what that kind of fall out will
do
how many innocent people

sir i remind you that you be
just a guest here

you would
all be dead be it not for i
david

prevent this

sir there be not much more we
could have do
we be totally
unprepared for this

do not give i unprepared
since
nineteen fifty whatever you guy
have have that space ship the
thing you find in new mexico

dad please

what be it roswell
you have the
space ship the body everything
locked up in a bunker the what be
it
area fifty one
that be it
area fifty one
you know and you
do not do nothing

regardless of what the tabloid
have say there be never any
space craft recovered by the
government
take i word for it
there be no area and no
recovered space ship

uh excuse i mr
president but
that be not entirely accurate

the end have come

hop on
we be heading out to el
toro

you cannot defy what have come it
be the end

with a daddy who loved to hunt
so do not think for one second that
i do not know how to use this


need a lift

when i fly overhead i see some
kind of base not far

it be not on the map

trust i it be there

i

base area nevada

why the hell be not i tell about
this place

two word mr
president
plausible deniability

i do not understand
where do all
this come from
how do this get
funded

you do not think they actually
spent ten thousand dollar for a
hammer and thirty thousand for a
toilet seat do you

mr
president i would like to
introduce you to dr
okun

well i guess you would like to see
the big tamale
follow i

she be a beaut be not she

never any space ship recovered by
the government huh

we have have this for forty year and
you do not know anything about
they

hell no we know ton about they
the near stuff have only
happen in the last few day

see we can not duplicate they type
of power so we have never be able
to experiment
but since these
guy start showing up all the
gizmo inside turned on
the last
twenty four hour have be really
exciting

people be dying out there
i
do not think exciting be the word
i would choose to describe it

what can you tell we about the
enemy we be facing

not all too dissimilar to we
breathe oxygen comparable
tolerance to heat
cold
probably why they be
interest in we planet
hey you want to see they

this be vault or as some of we
have come to call it the freak
show


when we find they they be
wearing biomechanical suit
once we get they off we be able
to learn a great deal about they
anatomy
eye ear bipolar
digestive system
no vocal cord
though
we be assuming they
communicate with each other
through other means

what kind of other means
hand
signal body language

some kind of extra sensory
perception
telepathy

can they be killed

these three die in the crash
they body be as frail as we
own
you just have to get past
they technology which be i be
sorry to say far more advance

you unlock a part of that
technology
you cracked they
code

all i do be stumble onto they
signal
i do not know how helpful
i can be

show they what you have discover
work together
we have get to find
a way to beat they

sorry lt
colonel i can not open
the gate without clearance

you want to see i clearance

see the gizmo flashing

we have be working around the
clock trying to get a fix on all
this crap
some stuff we figure
out right away

this thing we be pretty sure be
the life support for the cabin
this dohickey over here be
connected with the engine this
crap
we have no idea what that
stuff be for

but this over here be clearly what
they use to navigate and guide the
craft

someone grab i laptop for i

find something interesting

maybe

these pattern here they be
repeating sequentially just
like

they countdown signal
they
use this frequency for computer
communication
it be how they co
ordinate they ship

you know you be really starting
to make we look bad

they get one
they get one
alive

how long have it be unconscious

excuse i doctor

three hour

get he into containment stat

i boy be very sick he need
immediate attention

he be dying out
i want he
sprayed down with saline

i boy be slipping into a diabetic
coma
if you do not do something
about it right now he will die


OHaver miller come with i
take we to he



you be the head of the national
intelligence agency
you know all
about this
when be you
planning on informing the rest of
we

it have be deem classify

christ why do not you say
anything about this when they
first arrive
you could have
warn we before we launch a
counter attack that cost we
hundreds of american pilot

atlanta chicago and philadelphia
destroyed

and there be scatter report of
sighting over miami ft
worth
and memphis

we have learned that and
western ally installation be
the fir to be taken out
we
be next
they know exactly where
and how to hit we

and we force

we be down to approximately
fifteen percent sir
if you calculate the time it take
they to destroy a city and move
on we be looking at world wide
destruction of every major city
within the next thirty six hour

we be be exterminate

david david
what the hell be
you do

i be making a mess

this i can see

we have get to burn the rain forest
pop
dump toxic waste pollute
the air rip up the ozone
maybe
if we screw this planet up enough
they will not want it anymore

david you be drink

i think you well sleep this off
go back inside before you catch a
cold

pop you be a genius

Whatd i say

cold
of course


all right connie we be here
what be this all about

i really have no idea
he just
said to bring everyone down here

do that thing fly in outer
space

it certainly do

could anyone please step back
away from the craft

lt
mitchell would you mind
draw you pistol

what

from where you be standing do you
think you could shoot that can off
the alien craft

sorry about that
you see it be
protected by the craft shield
we can not penetrate they defenses

we know that already
what be you
point

i point be if we can not beat they
defenses then we must get
around
they

lt
mitchell would you please try
to shoot it again

how do you do that

i give it a cold

more accurately i give it a
virus
computer virus

be you telling we you can send
out a signal that will disable all
they shield

just as they used we satellite
against we we can use they own
signal against they

if we plant the virus directly
into the mother ship it would
then filter down into all the
correspond ship below

and just how do we infect the
mother ship with a virus

we will have to fly they craft out
of we atmosphere and dock with
the mother ship

we can enter here upload the
virus and set off an explosion
that could disable it
this would
disorient the small ship below
and buy you some time to take they
out

this be ridiculous

how long would they shield be
down

once they discover the virus it
could be a matter of minute

you want we to coordinate a
massive world wide counter strike
with a window of only a few
minute

with they shield down it might
be possible

please you be not buying into any
of this nonsense be you
we
do not have the manpower or the
resource to launch that kind of a
campaign
gesture to the alien
ship
not to mention that this whole
cockamamie plan be dependent on a
machine that no one in the world
be qualify to operate



i would not say that sir

i have see they in action
i have
watch they maneuver
with
you permission sir i would like the
opportunity to try

that thing a wreck
it crash
landed back in the fifties
we
do not even know if it be
capable
fly

remove the clamp

any other question

let we do it

i understand that you be upset
over the death of you wife but
that be no excuse for making
another fatal mistake

the only mistake i make be
appoint a sniveling little
weasel like you chief of staff

but this be a mistake i be
thankful to say i do not have to
live with
mr
Nimziki you be
fired

organize every plane you can find
and get some goddamned pilot
to fly they

yes sir

he can not do that

he just do


we have be tell that there may
be additional reenforcement in
hide near the golan straight

what the hello he saying

seem they be get a signal
one morse code

i still get believe this

the iraqi do not appear altogether
too please with this arrangement

how do you think the israeli
feel

it be from the american
they
want to organize a counter
offensive

it be about bloody time
what do
they plan to do

they claim to be able to bring
down they shield

when do they want to attack

the attack begin in thirteen
hour


how be we do

well than we think

we have confirmed division of
troop from different army all
around the world
most of europe
the middle east and asia be
battle ready

and we troop here

we have be collecting plane from
all over but

but what general

pilot sir
we do not have enough
people to get they in the air

then find they


how he do

just fell asleep
he be going to be
just fine
join i in a little
celebration

miguel
do not be mad
miguel

we be planning to launch a
counter offensive

with we deplete manpower we
must ask that anyone with any
flight experience come forward
military train be preferable
but anyone who can fly a plane
could be useful

i can fly i mean i be a pilot

sorry sir

you do not understand
i have get to
be part of this
this be
important to i
they ruined i
life

why do not you go somewhere and
sleep it off

we have hide the launcher in the
ship manifold

this will be attached to the ship
main console

it be just like an launch
pad on the stealths

exactly
use it the same way
only the nuke will not detonate on
impact
you will have another
thirty second to get as far away
as you can

i will see how they be do with
the radio transmitter

oh shit we be late

we will meet you there

thirty second
be not that
cutting it a little too close

we will be well on we way out of
there before we shoot that thing
off

it be the strong transmitter
we could get
it will tell we when
you have uploaded the virus

then cross you finger the
shield go down

with you
i do not understand why
you can not just show someone how to
plant the virus somebody train
for this kind of mission

if anything go wrong i will have
to think quickly adjust the
signal who know

you know how i be always trying to
save the planet
this be i
chance

now he get ambitious

it be too tight

i have to borrow it
i guess
that be good enough

how do i look

you be a lot of help

you be late

you know i

i know you like to make a big
entrance

before we do this i want you to
know i be sorry

sorry for what

i should have do this a long
long time ago



do you have the ring

you bet

witness

then let we get this show on the
road


beggar can not be chooser sir

good morning
in less than one
hour plane from here and all
around the world will launch the
large aerial battle in the
history of mankind
mankind
the word have new meaning
for all of we now
we be
remind not of we petty
difference but of we common
interest

perhaps it be fate that today july
the fourth we will once again
