needed to be diagnose with



delusion hallucination
disorganize speech disorganize
behavior and the negative
symptom i have have two
delusion
and hallucination
but they say
it have to continue for six month
to be diagnose schizophrenia and
mine have not be going on anywhere
near that long
so i take this
quiz in the back of the book and i
score a five out of a possible
twenty
schizophrenia start at
twelve
so they say it might be
a
brief psychotic disorder
whatever
it be i need to know what to do or
what to get on to get this thing
under control

look
i be a counselor
certify
but i be not a psychiatrist
i
can not prescribe anything to you
i
can talk to you i can recommend
where to send you but that be it

now that said if you want to talk
i will listen
for a lot of people
that be a good start

nothing will change
please
this
be what it mean to stay with we
this be something you have to do

could you move hannah back


it be fine

do you have any vacation time that
you could use

i do not have a job right now

well i know that time be hard
but i think it be really important
for you to separate yourself from
that storm shelter


i think you need to break away from
it for awhile
we can start you on
some medication that i think will
help but that action alone would
mean a lot

we usually go on a trip to myrtle
beach every summer
we be gonns
go this month

i think that would be okay if we
start the medication now
it would
give you all some time to prepare
as a family but i want to be
clear when curtis get back he will
need to take more time than that

what do that mean

i mean that he will need hand on
therapy at a real facility

you mean i have to leave i family

i think you need to seriously
commit to some treatment

hey
good huh


good
we put a top on it

what be it honey

what


sam

okay
