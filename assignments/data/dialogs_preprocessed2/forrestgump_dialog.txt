celebrity and a shrimpin boat
captain and a college graduate the
city of father of Greenbow alabama

then i get a call from he saying we

thing




now momma said there be only so much
fortune a man really need

praise the lord



and the rest be just for showing
off
so i give a whole bunch of it
to the four square gospel church



and i give a whole bunch to the bayou
la Batre fishing hospital



and even though Bubba be dead and
lieutenant dan said i be nut
i
give Bubbas mommy Bubbas share

and you know what



she do not have to work in nobody
kitchen no more


smell wonderful



and because i be godzillionaire and
i liked do it so much
i cut that
grass for free



but at nighttime when there be
nothing to do and the house be all
empty i would always think of jenny



and then she be there

hello forrest

hello jenny



jenny come back and stay with i



maybe it be because she have nowhere
else to go
or maybe it be because
she be so tire because she go
to bed and sleep and sleep like she
have not sleep in year
it be
wonderful have she home



every day we would take a walk and i would
jabber on like a monkey in a tree
and she would listen about pingpong and
shrimpin boat and momma makin a
trip to heaven
i do all the talkin
jenny most of the time be real quiet

big ol gob of rain and little
bitty stinging rain and rain

how could you do this



sometimes i guess there just be not
enough rock



i never really know why she come
back but i do not care
it be like
olden time
we be like pea and
carrot again



every day i would pick pretty flower
and put they in she room for she



and she give i the good gift anyone
could ever get in the wide world

okay you can open you eye

new shoe

they make they just for running



and she even show i how to dance
and well we be like family
jenny and i



and it be the happy time of i
life

and this fourth be witnessing one of
the large firework display in
the nation twohundred year
history

you do watch it

Mmhmm

here in new york harbor
after
the spectacular display of tall ship
early the statue of liberty

i be going to bed

i would make a good
husband jenny

you would forrest

but you will not marry i

you do not want to marry i

why do not you love i jenny
i be
not a smart man but i know what
love be

jenny

forrest i do love you

where be you running off to

i be not running



that day for no particular reason
i decided to go for a little run



so i run to the end of the road and
when i get there i think maybe
i would run to the end of town

president carter suffering from
heat exhaustion fell into the arm
of security agent



and when i get there



i think maybe i would just run across
Greenbow county
and i figure since
i run this far maybe i would just run
across the great



state of alabama
and that be what
i do i run clear across alabama

for no particular reason i just
keep on going
i run clear to the
ocean



and when i get there i figure since
i would go this far i might as well
turn around just keep on going



when i get to another ocean i figure
since i have go this far i might as
well just turn back keep right on
going



when i get tire i sleep
when i
get hungry i eat

when i have to go you know i go

and so you just run

yeah



i would think a lot about momma and Bubba
and lieutenant dan but most of all
i think about jenny
i think
about she a lot

for more than two year now a man
named forrest gump a gardener from
Greenbow alabama stopping only to

somebody who have lost all he money
in the Tshirt business and he wanted
