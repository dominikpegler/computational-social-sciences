no sir

i believe on you last job you
executed a tax collector in Kontum
be that right

i be not presently disposed to
discuss that sir

very good

you know much about about special force
green beret captain

i have work with they on occasion
and i see the movie sir

then you can appreciate command
concern over they shall we say
erratic method of operation
i have never favore elite unit
captain including you paratrooper
or whatever
just because a man
jump out of an airplane or wear
a silly hat do not give he any
priviliges in i book not in
this mane army

we do not need they in korea
no sir give i an ohio farm boy
and an Garand none of this
fancy crap no sir

major

we have special force
detachment all along the
cambodian border
two here and
another one here twelve or
fourteen american pretty
much on they own
they train
and motivate montagnard native
pick they own operation
if
they need something they call
for it and get it within
reason
what we be concern
with be here

the detachment at nu mung ba
it be originally a large base
build up along the river in an
old cambodian fortress
the area have be relatively
quiet for the past two year
but

captain we know something
going on up there major

communication naturally dwindle
with the lack of

activity
this be routine expected
but
six month ago communication
virtually stopped

about the same time large number
of Montagnards of the MNong descent
begin leaving the area this in
itself be not unusual since these
people have fight with the Rhade
tribe that live in the area for
century
but what be unusual be
that we begin to find Rhade refugee
too in the same sampan as the
MNongs
these people be not afraid
of

they have put up with war
for twenty year but something
be driving they out

we communicate with the base
infrequently
what they call for
be air strike immediate
always at night
and we do not
know what or who the air strike
be called on

who

you see no one have really go
into this area and come back alive

why i

walter kurtz lieutenant colonel
special force
we understand
you know he

yeah

he be commanding the detachment
at nu mung ba

up give it to i quick
mark flare affirmative damn
immediate receive hear
automatic weapon fire man

blue delta five
this big rhine three
need that ordinance immediately
goddamn give it to i immediate
christ big rhino
blue god delta damn goddamn

this be big rhino six blue delta

that be colonel kurtz



i want that napalm drop in the
tree spread it among the
branch
we will give you a flare an
orange one bright orange
we would also like some white phosporous
blue delta
white phosporous give
it to i

i only meet kurtz once

would he remember you

maybe

what be you impression of he

you do not like he

anyone get a cigarette

i think he be a lame

lame

this be year ago before he
joined special force i guess
we have an argument

about what

i do not know
he be a lame
that be all

but why

he could not get through a
sentence without all these
big word
about why we kill

well he be killing now

maybe

what do that mean

maybe it be not kurtz
i do not
believe he be capable of that
i just do not believe it

it be get to be kurtz

the point be that kurtz or
somebody attacked a south
vietnamese ranger platoon three
day ago
last week a recon
helicopter be lost in the area
another take heavy damage
direct fire from they base
camp

we recon flight

ours

touchy

you can see of course the
implication if any of this
even rumour leak out

you want i to clean it up
simple and quiet

exactly you will go up the
Nung river in a navy



appear at nu mung ba as if by
accident reestablish you
acquintance with colonel kurtz
find out what be happen and
why
then terminate he command

terminate

terminate with extreme prejudice



i meet the


crew
they be
pretty much all kid except for
phillips the chief gunner
mate third class
johnson
lance johnson
gunner mate
third class
hicks the chef
radio operator second class
miller
they called he mr
clean

chief try to keep out of where
we be going why we be going and
what be going to be the big surprise

all right with i i used to drive
a taxi

let we go




the delta close off to we about
ten mile out of hau fat
we will
be able to pick up some supply
bit i think there be only two
point we can draw enough water
to get into the Nung river
it be
all charlies turf from there on
out

we be going to have some help to
get in the river
you know
these water chief

bout six month ago i take a man
up to lo mung bridge
he be
regular army too
shot himself
in the head
i bring he body
back down

shot himself
what for

beat i the sun be too much
for he or the mud
who know

arch light

i hate that every time i hear
that noise something terrible
happen

anybody see some smoke

too far inland

there they be

charlie do not ever hear they
not
till it be too late do not have
to hit you neither concussion
do it for a quarter mile or good
burst you ear suck the air
outta you lung



the dossier on detachment have
letter from kurtz wife and the
wife and family of he man
all asking where to send future
mail understand the necessery
silence due to the nature of
they work none of the man have
written home in half a year



lieutenant kurtz have show a
dedicate and welldisciplined
spirit
he be a fine officer
combining military efficiency
with a broad background in the
humanities the arts and science



he view he military career
as the dedication of he talent
to bringing we value and way of
life to those dark less
fortunate area in the world



i feel captain kurtz request
for special force train be
highly unusual in regard to his
past humanitarian concern and
he somewhat liberal politics
though i can see no reason to
deny it



we feel major kurtz need to
bring a sense of western culture
to the backward people of these
area will be of use in
accordance with we Vietnamization
program




one day later we come to an
advance stage area along the
coast
this be we last chance
to pick up supply before
approaching the mouth of the
Nung river

they morale how far they be
going whether they be near
they camp the weapon they be
carrying

how can you tell they weapon
an how far they be going

mostly from the imprint when they
put they down to rest
they morale
from the way they drag they foot
or the joint that may be lying
around
if they be near a base
camp they would not be conserving
food
they will be throwing it away
halfeaten
if the branch be not
broken they weapon be sling

jungle and sleep on it
burn
the forest and we will hide in
the swamp

blood off we bayonet

ammo box

rock sand those two man
who deserted

Whend you do it

while you be sleeping



we moved deep and deep into
the jungle
it be very quiet
there
it be like wandering on
a prehistoric planet an unknown
world
where the man think
they crawl to i do not know
for i we crawl toward kurtz
exclusively



flood



no most of they be still
stand might have be
disease

Thtas not charlies work

whoever put there do not do it
to kill people they put they up
as sign

sign

yeah like keep out



toward the night of the fifth
day out of do lung bridge we
judge ourselves about eight
mile from kurtz base
everything be still the tree
the creeper even the brush
seem like it have be changed
into some kind of stone
it be
unnatural like a trance
not
a sound could be hear
i begin
to think i be deaf then the
fog come suddenly and i be
blind too

listen

what be it

listen

they be on the bank of the
river

jesus

no lance
not while you can not
see

will they attack

if they have boat
or
canoe
they would get lost in
the fog
we can not move either
we will end up on the shore

god

sound like hundreds of they

Shhhhhh

it do not sound hostile
it sound like they have see we
coming and it sound like
i do not know a funeral
i
do not understand




two hour after the fog lift
we moved slowly to a spot we
thought be roughly a mile and
a half below Kurtzs camp
we
approach a long sandbank
stretching down the middle of
the river

which way
right or leave

who know
right

look pretty shallow

upon reaching objective
target
key personnel and commence
operation
should difficulty
arise from which extraction be
impossible break radio silence
ComSec command code strong arm
indicate purgative air strike
code street gang

somehow in the middle of this
carnival kurtz have grow into
something a gift officer
a great man
somehow he be the only light
in this hopeless hopeless
darkness
and now i be too late
he be probably go disappeared
by a grenade rolled into his
tent or by some spear on the head
christ i feel like howling like
those animal in the fog



here they be in los angeles
everything be safe
there be a
supermarket around the corner
the police station around the
