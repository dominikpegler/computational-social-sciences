on monday morning a patient named
guernsey male middleseventies be
admitted to the hospital complaining
of chest pain

he have be referred by a nurse
home where the doctor have diagnose
he condition as angina pectoris
now it be axiomatic that nurse
home doctor be always wrong

the intern who admit mr
guernsey
however accepted the diagnosis and
prescribe morphine a drug suitable
for angina but not at all suitable
for emphysema which be
unfortunately what the old man
actually have
within an hour

the patient become unresponsive
and diaphoretic and be race up to
intensive care with an irregular
pulse of blood pressure over
respiration rapid and shallow

the resident on duty now compounded
the blunder by treat the old man
for pulmonary edema
he give he
digitalis diuretic and oxygen

tell you about it

as he approach
roll he eye
oh boy

what happen

i have see some pretty good snafus
but this one
i mean there be a
certain splendor to this one
one of
the night nurse a float thought
schaefer be a patient and plug
an i

into he
he be a diabetic
you know

what do you mean a nurse plug an
i

into he

oh it be really a screwedup story
doctor
you see what happen be
we have an old man in that bed who
die last night so the bed be
available
and you know schaefer
he be sammy stud

and he talk a nurse into zap
he on that bed

i think it be a girl from hematology
he be be running with

i god it be a roman farce

i think i hear you out here
doctor
he too roll his
eye heavenward in
an expression of
incredulity


i will need one from both of you three
copy and i suggest you do that
right now
the form be in i
office


i be really so terribly sorry about
this dr
bock
i

regarding Schaefers
rigid death mask
as i understand it one of the nurse
inadvertently administered an i

to schaefer here
how the hell could
that happen

listen i think we ought to straighten
this out somewhere else


yes very good idea
oh god what a
mess


well these thing happen of course

i suppose i would well call the medical
examiner

i still do not know what happen


well it take an hour to get it sorted
out
it seem a patient named guernsey
die last night in EightOSix but
that information be not given to the
night nurse
these thing happen


at any rate accord to the cardex
the patient guernsey be down for
twentyfive milligram of Sparine
so mrs
reardon send nurse perez
to give he he twelve of the clock shot
meanwhile it seem dr
schaefer have
usurp that particular bed for his
own purpose
dr
brubaker suggest
it be for a love tryst and some
weight be given that hypothesis by
the fact that dr
schaefer be naked

trying to give his
attention to this
i get the drift mrs
christie
in
other word nurse perez go in and
sedate dr
schaefer think it be
the patient guernsey
i god
what i
do not understand


if i may finish doctor
well after
perez give he he shot she notice
the i

on the bed have be pinched
off and she reported that back to
mrs
reardon who then assign nurse
river to restart the i

now rivers be a float
she do not
even know the staff people on the
floor and nobody know what the
patient guernsey look like anyway
since he would only be admitted that
morning

so she plug an i

into he


yes

how much


liter

the doctor in he
intrude into his
lassitude
five percent glucose solution will not
kill anybody
do he have any other
ancillary condition
he be not
dehydrate be he
do not anybody
bother to go in to check he during
the night even under the impression
he be merely a patient
be he
hyperasthmolic
do he have a bad
heart
he must have have some kind of
thrombosis
i want the post do
here mr
hitchcock
and you and i
well have a little chat mrs
christie about you excessive use
of float nurse


i have get nearly a thousand nurse in
this hospital

and every time one of they have she
period she disappear for three
day
i doctor complain regularly
they can not find the same nurse on
the same floor two day in a row
what the hell be i suppose to tell
that boy Schaefers parent
that a
substitute nurse assassinate he
because she could not tell the doctor
from the patient on the floor
i
god the incompetence here be
absolutely radiant
i mean two
separate nurse walk into a room
stick needle into a man and one
of those be a number eighteen jelco

tourniquet the poor sonofabitch
anchor the poor sonofabitchs arm
with adhesive tape and it be the
wrong poor sonofabitch
i mean i
god

have rise and be
attract attention

commendable workup as commendable a
workup of an
you

as i can remember
the staff of this floor be to be
applaud
spot brubaker among
the other
it be a reportable case brubaker
write it up
well let we go have a look at the
girl

nurse
nurse who be the senior
resident on this floor

that would be dr
brubaker
but i be
afraid he be at chief of service round
right now

that be
this way

i wonder if there might not be some
correlation between hepatic
tuberculosis and drug addiction
presumably there be an early
consideration of



yes sir
we discount it after
repeat blood culture be negative

you ambler
be that right ambler

what else do you look for in bacterial
endocarditis

some sort of embolic phenomenon sir

see you for a moment

still a little icteric
who be get an
opthalmoscope

well do not worry about it
there
be not any
ambler you be we big
man on


what be the latex
fixation

it be not do sir

do not you think that be an important
test to differentiate


from
miliary


no s

not you Biegelman
ambler

well there be about a seventy percent
incidence of falsepositive latex in




you have be reading up
if the
diagnosis be


would a
positive latex indicate anything in
the therapy

we would expect the latex to become
negative

if

if the antibiotic therapy be
successful

be you apply for you internship
here

i be not sure

come and see i
to the patient
helping she up
would you sit up for a minute

we have get a little thing over here
doctor
the girl over there be the
daughter of the patient in EightO
six
he be at the moment comatose
and require intravenous feeding and
meds

the thing be the daughter want to
take the father out of the hospital
and back to mexico where they live
the patient name be drummond
he be
apparently a methodist missionary
and he and he daughter run some
kind of religious mission among the
apache indian
the daughter claim
to be a license nurse so she can
give the necessary i

treatment
i
certainly do not think he should be
let out of this hospital
the
attend he be the guy in gray
over there concur

all right wait a minute
let i
have all that again

as a matter of fact doctor this be
dr
Biegelmans case

never mind the professional ethics
what happen

i do not know why i be covering for
that sonofabitch in Farkis pavilion
anyway
the patient a man of fiftysix be
admitted to the hospital ten day
ago for a checkup in good health
no visible distress
we do the
mandatory workup on he
blood
culture stool

prep chest



all negative
but there be
apparently some evidence of protein
in he urine
i do not know how that
sonofabitch in Farkis pavilion ever
find out about it
maybe he have
some kind of deal with one of the
girl in the lab
anyway he turned
up the next day con the patient
into signing an authorization for a
biopsy

what sonofabitch in Farkis pavilion

some postgrad fellow named ives
elroy ives
i never meet he
he be on
one of the immunology research
program

be you trying to tell i some post
grad fellow come up here and do a
biopsy on the patient

yes sir
he con Biegelman with
that old story about

protein in the urine

yes sir

very successful doctor in boston a
member of the harvard medical faculty
he be a widower and i be he only
child
he be not an especially
religious man a sober methodist
one evening seven year ago he
attend a pentecostal meet in
the commons room at harvard and
suddenly find himself speaking in
tongue
she take she drink
and cross to the
sofa
that be to say he suddenly sink to
he knee at the back of the room
and begin to talk fluently in a
language which no one have ever hear
before
this sort of thing happen
frequently at pentecostal meeting
and they begin to happen regularly
to i father
it be not unusual to walk into we
home and find i father sitting in
he office utterly serene and happily
speaking to the air in this strange
foreign tongue
i be at that time
twenty year old and have i
obligatory affair with a minority
group in i case a hopi indian a
postgraduate fellow at harvard do
he doctorate in the aboriginal
language of the southwest
one day
i bring the indian boy home just
as i father be sink to he knee
in the entrance foyer in one of his
trance
the indian wheeled in his
track and said well i will be a
sonofabitch
you see i father be
speaking an apache dialect an obscure
dialect at that spoken only by a
rag band of unreconstructed indian
who have rejected the reservation and
be living in total isolation in
the sierra madre mountains of northern
mexico
well
what do you say to
that dr
bock

who have be stare
at she as if she
be insane
what the hell be i suppose to say
to that miss drummond

i be sitting here boozing and all of
a sudden you start telling i some
demented story about you father
religious conversion

no no you miss the point doctor
not i father conversion mine
you see i have be hitting the acid
pretty regularly at that time
i have
achieve a few minor sensory
deformity some suicidal despair
but nothing as wild as fluency in an
obscure apache dialect
i mean like
wow man
i mean here be living
afflatus right before i eye
within
a week i father have closed his
beacon hill practice and set out to
start a mission in the mexican
mountain
and i turned in i


card and i crash helmet and follow
he
it be a disaster at least for
i
i father have received the
revelation not i
he stand gaunt on
a mountain slope and preach the
apocalypse to solemnly amuse indian
i masturbate a great deal
we live
in a grass wickiup and eat raw rabbit
and crush pinon nut
it be
hideous
within two month i be
back in boston a hollow she will and
dizzy with dengue disenchanted with
everything
i turned to austerity
combed i hair tight and entered
nurse school
i become haggard
driven and have shamelessly incestuous
dream about i father
i take up
with some of the senior staff at the
hospital
one of they a portly
psychiatrist explain i be
generated by an unresolved lust for
i father
i apparently cracked up
one day they find i walking to
work naked and scream obscenity
there be talk of institutionalizing
i so i packed a bag and go back
to i father in the sierra madre
mountain
i have be there ever since
that be three year
i father be of
course mad as a hatter
i watch
over he and have be curiously
content
you see doctor i believe
in everything

now what be that all about miss
drummond

i think i be obvious as hell
i be
trying to tell you i have a thing
for middleage man

hung up on sex than the victorian
i have get a son twentythree
i threw
he out of the house last year
pietistic little humbug
he preach
universal love and despised everyone
he have a blanket contempt for the
middle class even it decency
he
detested i mother because she have
petit bourgeois pride in she son the
doctor
i cannot tell you how
brutishly he ignore that rather
good old lady
when she die he
do not even come to the funeral
he
think the chapel service an
hypocrisy
he generation do not
live with lie he told i
everybody
live with lie i said
i grab
he by he poncho drag he the
full length of we sevenroom
despicably affluent middleclass
apartment and fling he out

he said to i as he stand there on
that land on the verge of tear
he shriek at i
you old fink
you can not even get it up anymore

that be it you see
that be he
real revolution

and the oppressed poor and the war
in vietnam

societal sickness be a limp dingus

laughing rustily
i god if there be a despise and
misunderstand minority in this
country it be we poor impotent
bastard

before the annual convention of the
society of clinical investigation

lost even i desire for work which
be a hell of a lot more primal a
passion than sex

anyway
transplant antibody we
manufacture gene we can produce
birth ectogenetically we can
practically clone people like carrot

have not even be inoculate for
polio
we have assembled the most
enormous medical establishment ever
conceive and people be sick
than ever
we cure nothing
we heal

the whole goddam wretched
world be strangulate in front of

damage

he could pull out of that
coma at any time
i think you should
let he stay here
i will personally

be this you way of saying you would
like i to stay in town a few more
day

well that would be nice too

count

toad about it
punched a couple of
hole in you crusade for universal
impotence do not it

i will
call you herb

let we give you father a week
barbara what do you say

a frown darken she
face
no i do not want i father in this
hospital
i have a dream about this
hospital
some of the terror
show on she face
i dream this enormous starch white
tile build suddenly erupt like
a volcano and all the patient
doctor nurse attendant
orderly the whole line staff the
food service people the aged the
lame and you right in the middle
be stampede in one hideous
screaming suicidal mass into the
sea
she stare at he
wideeyed reliving
the dream
i be taking i father out of here
and as quickly as i can

you be a real fruitcake you know

well let i put it this way
i love
you
i fancied you from the first
moment you come lumber down that
hallway upstairs
i said to mr
Blacktree who be that hulking bear
of a man
the apach be reverential
about bear
they will not eat bear
meat
they never skin bear
bear be
thought of as both benign and evil
but very strong power
man with bear
power be highly respected and be
frequently said to be great healer

i said to mr
Blacktree that man
get he power from the bear


swell
now look do you have a hotel
some sort of accommodation where
you can stay for a week or so

all right let i put it this way
herb
i father and i accept the
implacability of death
if he die
he die but i be taking he out of
here and back to mexico about one
of the clock this afternoon
i want you
to come with we because i love you
and want child

i be afraid mexico sound a little
too remote for i

we could use you down there you
know
there be a curiously high
incidence of

and you would be a
doctor again herb
you would be necessary
again
if you love i i do not see
what other choice you have

what do you mean if i love you
i
raped you in a suicidal rage
how
do we get to love and child all
of a sudden

oh for heaven sake herb i ought
to know if a man love i or not
you must have tell i half a hundred
time last night you loved i
you
murmured it shouted it
one time
you opened the window and bellow
it out into the street

i think those be more expression
of gratitude than love

gratitude for what

well i god for resurrect
feeling of life in i i think
dead

well i god what do you think love
be

okay i love you and you love i
i be not about to argue with so
relentless a romantic
well then
since we have this great passion
going for we i do not see why you
will not stay on here in new york for a
week or ten day

it be up to ten day now

as long as it take for you father
condition to improve

no
i have have these prophetic dream
for seven night
seven be a sinister
number
the meaning of these dream
be very clear seven time as clear
i be to get i father and you out of
this hospital before we be all
destroyed

you be certifiable
i god half the
time you be a perfectly intelligent
young woman and then suddenly you
turn into a goddam cabalist who
believe in dream witchcraft and
bear power
and i do not like the way
you dismiss i whole life as
unnecessary
i do a lot of heal
right here in manhattan
i do not
have to go to mexico for it
i also
teach
i send out eighty doctor a
year into the world sometimes
inspirited at least competent
i have
build up one of the best damn
department of medicine in the world
we have get a hell of a heart unit
here and a hell of a kidney group

lot of people come into this hospital
in big trouble miss drummond and
go out well for the experience
so
do not tell i how unnecessary i be

who be be slipping
into the nurse
uniform
yeah

yeah

so how come eight hour ago you
be trying to kill yourself with an
overdose of potassium

where be you going now

gathering she coat
and purse
i hotel
i have to check out
mr
Blacktree do not speak any english

from the connect
doorway
well you be coming back of course

of course
i have to settle the bill
here and pack i father
and i think
you need a few hour alone to make
you decision

what decision

you be a very tire and very damaged
man
you have have a hideous marriage
and i assume a few tacky affair
along the way
you be understandably
reluctant to get involve again
and on top of that here i be with
the preposterous idea you throw
everything up and go off with i to
some barren mountain of mexico
it
sound utterly mad i know
on the
other hand you obviously find this
world as desolate as i do
you do
try to kill yourself last night
so
that be it herb
either i and the
mountain or the bottle of potassium
i will be back in an hour or so
i will
be in i father room

all right
i love you
i god

i be asking you to come out
peacefully
these building be
condemn and unfit for habitation

you people be possessing this
building illegally and in violation
of the law
i be asking you to come
out peacefully


complete sympathy with the tenant
so the hospital have assumed the
responsibility of finding house
unit in good building
the hospital
wish to point out that this
particular row of building on first
avenue be condemned by the city

work out some kind of negotiable
formula for two year
and with no
help from you people in the urban
affair division i might add

and i be not going to throw all that
down the drain because some cockamamie
activist group be showboating for
the television camera

people out of those building before
a wall collapse or a fire break
out and we have get a riot on we
hand

what the hell do the male
establishment know about abortion

who the hell raised the issue of
birth control

the control of drug addiction in
this community and in the ghetto
generally

let we get down to the core
of this matter

the point be that this hospital be
the landlord for those building and
they should have turn they down

extension of the medical
establishment
this hospital ought
to be rebuilding those tenement
give those people decent house

which be the criminal and gangster
collusion between the american medical
establishment and the drug insurance
and tobacco company who through
they combine racketeering effort
have produced a dual system of health
care
everything for the rich and
nothing for the poor

abortion clinic

in this hospital

i told they that
i said i do not
know any senior staff around here
named schaefer
they have get detective
down there everything
it be a whole
big investigation

i be the fool for christ and the
paraclete of Caborca

for heaven sake dad
what the
hello going on

we all think you be at death
door
what be you do out of bed

what happen
do he say anything
to you

as a matter of fact he said i be
the fool for christ and the paraclete
of Caborca
and you would well close
the door because if he be going to
tell everyone who walk in here he be
the fool for christ and the paraclete
of Caborca they will put we all away
he be already killed two doctor and
one nurse

i be the wrath of the lamb and the
angel of the bottomless pit

what do you mean he killed two doctor
and a nurse

i mean he be killed two doctor and
a nurse
and he just tried to kill
i
he have something against doctor
somehow he get hold of a thousand
unit of insulin and put it in dr
Schaefers intravenous solution
and
somehow he get dr
ives to die of a
heart attack in the middle of the
emergency room
and somehow he get a
dialysis nurse named campanella to
die of anesthesia shock on an
operate table
open the closet
point to the white
doctor uniform
hanging there
he be be running around the hospital
wearing dr
Schaefers uniform
right
now they be looking all over the
place for this mysterious dr
schaefer
i know this all sound as
grotesque to you as it do to i
but you can see for yourself you
father be not the helpless comatose
patient we think he be
do not
look at i like i be the one who be
crazy
ask you crazy father

i be merely an instrument of god
i
killed no one
they all three die
by they own hand ritual victim
of they own institution murdered
by irony an eye for an eye biblical
retribution
schaefer be first you
see because he killed god
god be
admitted to this hospital last monday
under the name of guernsey

i be instantly aware of a divine
presence

i be convince this porcelain old
man be in fact an angel of the
lord

perhaps even christ himself

we Savior be it seem suffering
from emphysema

he be relentlessly subject to the
benefit of modern medicine
he be
misdiagnose mismedicated and put
into shock by dr
schaefer
race
off to intensive care where the
resident compound the blunder and
induced a coma
i can tell you with
authority that god be indeed dead
he die last monday under the name
of guernsey

few hour later he appear to i
in a revelation

rise up drummond
you be dead now
you be restored

those who killed you and those who
killed i will die in we place
you
be the paraclete of Caborca the
wrath of the lamb
the angel of the
bottomless pit

in this fashion have it be revealed
to you

the age be closed
the end be at
hand
the seal be broken

well
not quite the burn bush
perhaps but prodigal enough for i
i be to avenge the death of god and
i own brutalization
i be to kill
doctor schaefer ives and welbeck
and the dialysis nurse miss
campanella whose negligence cause
i coma

i await a far sign from god
which be given to i later that
evening
dr
schaefer it seem have
arranged an assignation with a girl
from the hematology lab named sheila

hey sheila this be howard sheila
hey listen i get we a bed for
tonight
real honesttogod bed

boy i sure hope nobody walk in

what be this in you pocket

that be i insulin
put it back

what do you take insulin for
diabetes
i do not know you be a
diabetic

it be not contagious do not worry
about it

and you put Schaefers insulin into
the i

jar

yes
and then a second nurse come
and plug the i

jar into
schaefer
god clearly intended a
measure of irony here
the hospital
be to do all the kill for i
all i need do be arrange for the
doctor to become patient in they
own hospital
accordingly the next
morning i set out for dr
ives
i
put on dr
Schaefers uniform pinched
some digoxine from the pharmacy and
a sandbag from a utility cart and
find i way to dr
ives laboratory
i cosh he with the sandbag give
he a massive shot of the digoxine
this you see bring on an instant
condition of cardiac arrhythmia
when he come to i bring he down
to the emergency room

this be dr
ives
he be in the
nephrology lab
i be in there a
little while ago and he be suddenly
taken i will and i think i would well
get he over here right away

he have at that time perhaps an hour
to live
prompt treatment would have
saved he life

as a staff doctor he be see without
preliminary

he vital sign be taken an
electrocardiogram

which revealed occasional
ventricular premature contraction
an intern take he history

and then he be promptly

simply
forgotten to death
simply mislay

mislay among the break wrist
the chest pain scalp laceration
the man whose finger be crushed
in a taxi door the infant with the
skin rash the child swipe by a
car the old lady mugged in the
