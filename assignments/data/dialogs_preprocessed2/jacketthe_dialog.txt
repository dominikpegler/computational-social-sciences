look that way



sergeant starks be very lucky

little more to the right and it
would not have wanted to come out

but he be never going to be able to
remember what happen

it be hard to say
sergeant starks
could have retrograde amnesia
or
any form of
psychological suppression
it be very
common with trauma like this

sergeant starks be in the room
and i want to know when i be
going home

family in the states

have friend or distant relative

in case you get lost or can not
remember who you be

hm

i think i can remember what be on
they

william starks
thanks




jackie and jeans be the only
thing you know for certain about
that day




be you aware we have no last name
no place of residence and no record
of any physical presence for these
friend of yours
how be that
possible in this day and age



i may need to actually hear that
answer mr
starks

yes

eddie officer
harrison be lying in a pool of he
own blood on he back


william starks could be block the
incident
it would explain he well
systematized scheme about the little
girl and she mother
delusion as
complex as that can often replace the
reality of an incident like this

officer Harrisond be shoot three
time
he be long dead by the time
we get there



i have hear of gulf war syndrome
the medical community be only
beginning to gather information about
it

gulf war syndrome
what the
why
do not we start diagnose hard life
syndrome while we be at it
i have
get a lot of conviction we could
overturn with that logic

sergeant starks be award the
purple heart
that award do not
applaud violence or murder
it
applaud honor


he subconscious be block it the
same way it begin to in the gulf
particularly as something similarly
traumatize happen to he then

it be not a question of whether or not
he be sane when he do it
he
absolutely be
three bullet in one
man be three moral failing in
another

war be not a special
half the
shit that go on could not be tidy
into a top of the hour headline
either because it could not be say
neatly or because it could not be say
at all
it be ugly
and they do not
put ugly on

if starks do kill that officer
you can not hold a man
responsible for a damage mind


for god sake i client said he
think he be already die once
he
do not know what be going on



nearly whispered
i do not know how it happen

on the count of first degree murder
we find the defendant william
starks not guilty by reason of
insanity



i hereby sentence you to be committed
to a facility for the criminally
insane where i hope that doctor and
the proper treatment can help you




mr
starks i hope that someday you
might be well so that we will have
lost only one life in this tragedy

i would certainly say he should be
considered violent just given his
case


how do he dodge a conviction

he defense argued posttraumatic
stress and delusional disorder
he
evidently could not account for a
similar incident during he service
in desert storm


so why be not he just in the
psych ward of the county jail

apparently he be a decorate vet
and
have another one testify for he
who
know
to
tom do you
mind taking he


william
william can you hear i

i have given you some drug to help
with you adjustment

what kind of drug
because
these seem pretty
pretty serious

well you condition pretty
serious

so they say
off beckers
steady gaze what

i be just looking at you
do that
make you uncomfortable

depend on what you be seeing

you said you could not remember
kill officer harrison
correct

you do not believe i do you


it be not i job to believe you

you be a doctor
i would think

it be not i job to believe you or to
understand you
it be i job to try to
cure you and if that be a nogo then
to
take some kind of care of you

lucky i

you shoot a man three time
first in
he heart then in he stomach and
then
point blank in the back of
he head
and then you just
forget
all about it
whole life erase
with three easy little word
i
do not
know
what would it be if we
could all not know what we do not
want to have to face


i do not belong here
i do not


i be sorry
i do not mean
i be
sorry
i do not mean it

will you listen to i

when we would start fighting i would go for
the knife
then she keep threatening
to have i put away and looking
around she finally do


yeah well time probably would

effective one if you know what i

i have a patient a few year ago
he
name be ted casey

i do not give a shit about you
patient

i be not pause to see if you do
but incidentally you should
because you be bird of a feather

ted raped and sodomized a sevenyear
old girl
he lawyer ask i
to have a look at he because after
he deed be do
he climb
into the tree of the forest where he
killed she and woofed like a dog
he
could not even remember he name when
i speak to he but curiously
enough he could speak back

ted never go to prison because
everyone including i be
convinced he be sick
so he come
here


then one day a little girl come with
she mother to visit a relative and i
caught ted stealing look at she
the kind you really have to steal if
you know what i mean
i ask
ted then if he could remember what
the little girl who he have
slain
be wearing
he give i a
look i will never forget and when he
answer it be not with a color or
any sort of physical description i would
expect
oh yes he said
i remember
it
i remember it well
those
be actually he last word i think

we be not bird of a feather

maybe not
but i do think
you be in a tree
woofing like a
dog
and i be just trying to help you
the only way i can think of

what happen to you cheek dr
becker

i do not know
but he do die

hey
you be not suppose to be out
here

what be you going to do to i

well


i think i would just ask you to come
back inside with i

and if i do not want to come

i guess i would ask you why

because i do not think i be crazy

you be not crazy

you suffer from delusional disorder
that do not mean you be
crazy
it
just mean you be confuse
and
you be here instead of in jail
because that be determined to have
play a role in you kill of a
police officer

alleged kill of a police officer

you be convicted of the crime

that conviction do not convince i
of anything
until i know that i do
it i be not going to accept that i
do

you may never remember at all

you mind grasp of reality and the
real event that have happen to you
have be damaged

no
the real event that have
happen to i have be fucked up
not i mind


william i would like to ask you
something if i can

since when do people around here have
to ask permission to do anything

how be you treatment progress with
dr
becker

be not the case

why what would you do

make it stop

so it be helping

it be making i feel like a
different person

you comino


you should be careful
you could be
killed if they find you out here

believe i i know

what be you talking about the other
day

i be not talking about anything

when he go to scratch it but seem
to i you be saying that be about to
happen anyway
just be careful
not to walk yourself right into
something


we be late

i wish they would skip the formality of
this annual review and just cut we
budget
we silence on the matter
should be enough to appease the civic
conscience without wasting an hour we
do not have


maybe it be not such a waste

it be the tick of a box on a sheet
of paper no one care about



they do not care about all the thing
we do right
but they might
they might care about what we be
do wrong
that be what they
should come here to look for

what should they be looking for


they should just be looking hard

where
it be becker be not it
he be do stuff be not he

to an investigation of dr
beckers
mistreatment of some of he patient
that be when they find out how badly
he be drug he patient

you bleed to death

what

i do not know how you get the cut to
you head but you die bleeding from
it

and you be sure i body be find on
january st

do you really believe i

i do not know
i think i be
crazy after you left that day
i die
i still think i could be crazy
but
then i replay that night in i head
the part of it i could remember
and it be like
i do not care if i
be or am
i have not feel that way
in a room with someone i whole life
and when you left all i
wanted be

i want to trust you
should
i trust you

yes

then we need to figure out what
happen to you
it be the only thing
we can do

i know


alpine grove still exist
i look
it up on the net
we should go there
and see if there be still anyone
around who might have known what
happen to you

if they do not take i out before
then
what be the
net

i do not kill officer harrison

i know

how
do they figure it out after i
die

no
they never figure it out
i do
most murderer do not stop to help a
drink woman and she little girl on
the side of the road
not without
hurting they


i be sorry i can not tell you more about
you father death mr
starks
we
own medical examiner determined only
that he die from a blunt trauma to
the head but that be right around
the time the alpine groves staff
changed and i be afraid we do not have
the good record system before then


he body be find on january
but do you know if that be
long after he have die


no i do not
i be sorry
i wish i know
more

what about dr
thomas becker or dr
Loel Lorenson
there be also a dr
Gries i think


well dr
Lorenson be still here at
the hospital
if she be here at the
time you father be then i be sure
she would be of more help to you

what about dr
becker and mr
Gries


unfortunately i be not familiar with
dr
becker and dr
Gries passed away
three four year ago

do you have any kind of forwarding
address for dr
becker


you father be here year ago
i
doubt the hospital would have that
if dr
becker be still even alive
be
there a particular reason you need
to know how you father die

he be the only family i remember


i will see what i can find out about
dr
becker
and maybe dr
Lorenson
will know something



let i just tell she we be here

hello
i be beth Lorenson

it be nice to meet you mr
starks

and you be

i be just williams friend

i think we will be fine from here
thanks stanley


i god you look exactly like he

i never know i father
do you

yeah i do
he be i most
memorable patient

why

at the end he make i change i mind
about a lot of thing

you think i father be crazy

no
i do not think he be crazy
he
needed help
but he be not crazy
you father actually helped i
with a case of mine

what case

i be working with a boy named
eugene

who be eugene

he be a friend son
be you
familiar with the case


just a little when we be looking
up information about williams
father
how do he help

it be complicate but looking at
starks in a way you father let i
know how i would get through to he

how

he just said
that i would shock eugene
and then thing would change for he

i do not understand

i still do not either even after all
these year

do you know how i father die

i do not know how much i remember but
i seem to think it be from a
cut or
blow of some sort or another

how do he get it

i do not know

but dr
morgan said you be around
when i father be

i be
but i see a lot of cut and a
lot of blow
i be sorry i do not know
more about you father

i do not know about everything that
go on here


well do you think dr
becker would
have any idea

how do you know about dr
becker

i dad write some thing down before
he die

that be right
he do

so maybe dr
becker would know
but as i be sure you know the
statute of limitation have run out
for charging the hospital with any
liability

why would we do that

because becker resigned after the
charge bring against he by state
patient advocacy group

i see you have do you homework
alpine grove undergo a lot
of change since then
at the time
we do not have the
resource to
help we patient the way we needed
to
now we do
and thing be
different

i would not be so sure
like you said
about back then you might not know
everything going on around here


it be important for you to know who
you father be be not it

yeah it be

it be almost as if you life depend
on it
be not it

exactly

well
let i know how you
search turn out

we will

i do not believe a thing she just
said

i neither
who be the boy she be
talking about eugene

i have no idea

you think Lorenson kill you

maybe
i do not know
seem more
likely becker do but at the very
least she know how i die

let we see if they have an address for
becker
i also want to figure out
more about the kid you helped she
with

why


because that be the part i believe be
true
you probably do help she
somehow with the boy and Eugenes
name do come up over and over again
on the abstract i pulled

there be one more thing i want
to see

this be the room
they used to hang
the jacket there

this be where it happen
this be
the room i be actually in right now

i can show you
it be probably in
there


maybe this be not such a good idea

yes it be
i finger be
the only thing i could move

dead body do not bleed
and they
certainly can not claw so hard they
dent metal

you folk be not suppose to be down

starved himself to death before he
be bring here
all because he
wife left he for another man

maybe that just make he weak not
crazy
or maybe he be crazy

still do not make i think i be


and judging by the fact that you
just told i about another patient
it do not even make you think i be
so what do not you work on persuade
yourself first

why do not you help i

because i do not have time

why not

i be about to die unless i do
something to stop it

and how do you know that

because of the future
i know what be
going to happen

william that be just another facet
of i delusion

and what about you work with eugene
the kid
be that another facet of i
delusion

how do you know about eugene

you told i about he
i see you and
i think you think i know something
about he
so you told i

how do you know about eugene


you told i
it be like two part of
you talking through i
look judging
from you reaction there be no other
way i could know about he

there obviously be so what do not you
just tell i how you find out about
he

some part of you suspect even if
you do not know for sure that what
i be saying be true

i do not know how you know about
eugene but these idea be part of
you delusion


they be not i delusion
look
just leave i business with becker to
i

one thing get nothing to do with
the other

one get everything to do with the
other
so unless you want i blood on
you hand
leave what be between i
and becker between i and becker


hey i bring you some smoke

Lorenson said you wife left you for
another man and that be when you lost
it

geez how be that for a fuck thank
you

be it true

she left i i tried to kill she i
tried to kill myself
she be mean i
be weak i be cruel so she left i
do not plan it do not see it


i do not want to see it
i be in here
because they say i have a nervous
condition
well here i
question who would not be nervous if
they really look at they life
whose life be that good

not this luckless little mammal
what difference be it to they
beat
slow down you believe what you want
to believe
one version be easy
than another so you make it you own


i will tell you this though
however
nut i be i be not nuts enough not
to know how wrong it be to put a
human being in something like that

mackenzie what if we be
crazy

what if we be
Therere
crazy thing than think up
fiction for yourself

everyone do it do not they
even
becker
that roller coaster car pop
more pill than all of ward

becker do
be you sure

i have be here for year
it be i
neighborhood
course i be sure
he be
as drugged up as the rest of we
i
guess he have to be to put up with all
this

mackenzie but you be ok

at least it be some kind of bar we have
get you behind

said something you could not have
possibly have known
you come back
