great
so we have officially lost
doug
he wedding be in what
hour

relax it be doug he be probably
crashed out on someone couch
right now
all we have to do be
retrace we step from last night
and we will find he


okay so last night

well we start on the roof

right that be like ish

then
i think
we have steak at
the palm

yeah
then
we play crap at the
hard rock
maybe

that sound right

okay honestly
i do not even
remember going to dinner

i vaguely recall
do body shot
at some point
be that
maybe

i be pretty much blank after the
hard rock

i think we go to the flamingo
after that
and then i just
remember a lot of blue light
and
the overpower smell of baby oil

so that be what ish

give or take

be doug still with we


yes
yes
doug be with we
i
tackle he
for some reason

okay
so we only have a hour
window where we could have lost he

hey
look we be at the flamingo

receipt from the rio at

for dollar

the valet ticket say we return
here at


we drive last night

here a receipt from sbarro
the
meal be comped for some reason

why do we have a matchbook from the
golden pony all male revue

someone could have given that to we

hahaha

i think we should call tracy

absolutely not

what if doug called she
she might
know where he be

yeah i be with alan on this one

of course you be with alan you be
both gutless coward
but we be not
calling tracy
you never call the
bride from the bachelor party
ever
if i ball be on fire and
tracy be sitting next door with a
tall glass of water i still
would not call she
it be a rule

but should not we at least tell she
