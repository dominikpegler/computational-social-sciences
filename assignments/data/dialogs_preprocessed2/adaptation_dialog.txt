i

as natural selection work solely by and
for the good of each be all corporeal
and mental endowment will tend to
progress towards perfection

entangle bank clothed with many plant
of many kind with bird singing

about a white man and three Seminole man
arrested with rare orchid they would stolen
out of a place called the

we get a Seminole or Seminoles in the

very talented
really

thanks
thank you
thanks

so

sort of hot in here

yeah it be a bit
so why do not you
tell i you thought on this crazy
little project of ours

first i think it be a great book


laroche be a fun character be not he

and Orlean make orchid so fascinating
plus she musing on florida orchid
poaching
indian
great sprawl new
yorker stuff
i would want to remain true to
that let the movie exist rather than be
artificially plot driven

okay great great
i guess i be not
exactly sure what that means

oh
well
i be not sure exactly yet
either
so
know it be

oh
okay
great
so um what

it be just i do not want to compromise by
making it a hollywood product
an orchid
heist movie
or changing the orchid
into poppy and turning it into a movie
about drug run
know

oh of course
we agree
definitely

or cramming in sex or car chase or
gun
or character learning profound
life lesson
or character growing or
character changing or character
learning to like each other or character
overcome obstacle to succeed in the
end
know
movie shit

see we think maybe susan Orlean and
laroche could fall in love during the
course of


alienated journalist write about
passionate backwood guy and he teach
she to love
i mean it do not happen
it would not happen
it be hollywood

so anyway i just wanted to stop by to
congratulate you on you promotion

well thank again
it be all so stupid

i think it be great
you photo in the
trade and everything
pretty cool

anyway
yeah
so what be up with you

i be consider job
mostly crap
there be one you might like about
flower

flower
really
what be it

they want i to do an adaptation of a
book called the orchid thief

oh i god
you be kidding
i read that
i loved that book

see see see
i be not lying to you

i loved the book


oh charlie orchid be the most amazing
flower
so complex

i know
they be really great

you should take this job
do not it
sound exciting to immerse yourself in a
real subject and learn everything about
it
blake write about seeing heaven in a
wild flower
and after you learn all
this stuff you can teach i

that would be fun

god they be such beautiful flower
and
so sexy
know
do you know that orchid mean

testicle
i just read that

testicle
can you believe it

i swear it would be fucking great for
someone to have the testicle to make
that book into a movie man
instead of
this bullshit all the time
something
not about sex and violence and car chase
and love story people learn
profound lesson
jesus be not nature
enough


Pseudemys floridana
do you fella know
you fella believe the world rest on the
back of a turtle
not you fella
specifically
although maybe you fella
specifically
that i can not speak to

Polyrrhiza Lindenii
ghost

cut it down russell

plus i love the idea of learning all
about orchid
i really admire those
guy who know everything about ant or
fungus or whatever
i would like to be more
like that
see i tend to write self
involve selfloathing
even
masturbatory stuff

and it be wonderful by the way

thanks
that be nice to hear
but i need
to challenge myself as a writer
i have
arrive at an age where i want to think
about the world in a different way

adapt someone else work be certainly
an opportunity to think differently


yes
and i welcome the challenge of
taking a small subject like orchid
something that would never draw people
into a theater and making that
fascinating
i want to show people
heaven in a wildflower
as blake write

any one at all ma

i want this then

wonderful choice
and spiritually
significant
do you know that native
american believe the whole world rest
on the back of a turtle

well anyway david and i be discuss
he philosophy of history and i be

strike by he notion that history be
a human construct

yeah

that nature do not exist
historically but rather cyclically


so whereas human history spiral forward
building upon itself nature

augustus Margary survive toothache
rheumatism pleurisy and dysentery

fatality of get they almost as much
as he loved the orchid themselves

well that be exactly the issue
this be a state preserve

yes sir it be
oh and i colleague be all Seminole
indian
do i mention that
you be
familiar i be sure with the state of
florida v
james
billie

so you know that even though Seminole
chief billie killed a florida panther
one of what forty in the entire world

the state could not successfully prosecute
he
because he be an indian and it be his
right
as repugnant as you or i as white
conservationist might find he action

but


not to mention the fail attempt on
three separate occasion to prosecute
Seminoles for poaching palm frond
which i believe they use to thatch the
roof of they traditional chickee hut

he be right
that be exactly what we use
they for
Chickee hut

through all remember time


the script i be starting it be about
flower
no one ever do a movie

foremost expert
but that all be
revealed at the hear



the orchidaceae be a large ancient
family of perennial plant with



the most memorable fascinating
character tend to have not only a
conscious but an unconscious desire
although these character be unaware of
they subconscious need

maybe you should watch what you eat
donald
do you ever consider maybe
you be a bit fat
do it ever occur to
you you kind of represent i in the
world
that people look at you and
think he be charlies twin therefore
that be what charlie must look like

by the way momes paying for the seminar

do you even hear what i said

yeah
anyway
i pitched mom i
screenplay

jesus do not say pitch


sorry
anyway she loved i
telling
of i story to she
she said it be like
silence of the lamb meet psycho



hey maybe you and mom could collaborate
i hear she be really good with structure

you think you be so superior charles
well i be really going to write this
and
you will see
and and
you suck okay



florida be a landscape of transition



do not proliferate character
do not
multiply location
rather than
hopscotching through time space and
people discipline yourself to a
reasonably contained cast and world

florida be a landscape of transition and
mutation a hybrid of unruliness and
orderliness nature and artifice



we open on state road
lonely
stretch of road cutting through untamed
swampland
suddenly a beatup white van
barrel around a curve
it be driver
a
skinny man with no front tooth


finally mr
laroche what be you
experience in the area of horticulture

okay i have be a professional
horticulturist for twelve year
i have
owned a plant nursery of i own which be
destroyed by the hurricane
i be a
professional plant lecturer
i have given
at least sixty lecture on the
cultivation of plant
i be a publish
author both in magazine and book form
i have extensive experience with orchid
and the asexual micropropagation of
orchid under aseptic culture
this be
laboratory work not at all like you
nursery work
i be probably the smart person i know

thank you

you be very welcome

what

look you want to hear i pitch or what

go away
god damn it


know i be just trying to do something

hey thank a lot man
cool
flick on light then in pitch
mode

okay there be this serial killer right

no wait
see he be be hunt by a
cop
and he be taunt the cop right
sending clue who he next victim be
he be already holding she hostage in his
creepy basement
so the cop get
obsess with figure out she identity
and in the process he fall in love with
she
even though he be never even meet
she
she become like the
unattainable like the holy grail

it be a little obvious do not you think

okay but there be a twist
see we find
out the killer suffer from multiple
personality disorder
okay
see he be
really also the cop and the girl
all of
they
it be all he
be not that crazy

look the only idea more overuse than
serial killer be multiple personality
on top of that you explore the notion
that cop and criminal be really two
aspect of the same person
see every
cop movie ever make for other example of
this

mom called it psychologically taut


the other thing be there be no way to
write this
do you consider that
i
mean how exactly would you show a
character holding himself hostage

trick photography

okay that be not what i be asking
what
i be asking be in the reality of this
movie if there be only one character
right
okay
how could you
what
exactly would the scene
how

i agree with mom
very taut
sybil
meet
i dunno something very taut

they be going to fucking crucify i

i will go into the Fakahatchee with a
chainsaw
i swear to god

buster for crying out loud i remind
she the indian used to own Fakahatchee
look we will deal with all this at trial

the new yorker
it be a maga

i be familiar with the new yorker
the
new yorker yes the new yorker

piece about you situation down here

yeah
put this in
i do not care what
go on here
i be right and i will take
this all the way to the supreme court
that judge can screw herself

that for real would go in

the orchidaceae be a large ancient
family of perennial plant with one
fertile staman and a three petal
flower
in most orchid species one petal
be enlarged into a lip and be the most
conspicuous part of the flower



the orchidaceae be a large ancient

the world who know how to cultivate it

the plan be get the indian to pull it

of they baby in i lab sell they and

ever love i like that
like i love
almost every woman i see

once you get the sickness it take over
you life
i start out just
photograph they
now look at i
it will happen to you
you will see

i do not think so
i be not prone to


Angraecum sesquipedale
beauty
god
darwin write about this one
charles
darwin
evolution guy
hello

i know who darwin be



therefore i should infer from analogy
that probably all the organic being
which have ever live on this earth have
descend from some one primordial form
into which life be first breathe

okay open of movie
four billion
year ago
life have not begin
endless
barren terrain
silence
silence

see that nectary all the way down there
darwin hypothesize a moth with a nose
twelve inch long to pollinate it
everyone think he be a loon
then
sure enough they find this moth with a
twelve inch proboscis proboscis means
nose by the way and


i know what proboscis mean

every one of these flower have a specific
relationship with the insect that
pollinate it
there be an orchid that
look exactly like this particular
insect
so the bug hump the flower and
get covered with it pollen
thusly

i get it

that be called pseudocopulation
these
flower be smart
you get to fall in
love with they
once you learn anything
about orchid you will devote you life to
learning everything about they

i wanted to want something as much as
people wanted these plant but it be not
part of i constitution

i suppose i do have one unembarrassed
passion
i want to know how it feel to care about
something passionately




then after the entire history of
life on the planet in the last second
of the montage we see the whole of human
history
toolmake hunt farm
war lust religion selfconsciousness
yearn
then bam
cut to susan Orlean

the pioneeradventurers in florida have to
travel inward into a place as dark and
dense as steel wool
they have to
confront what a dark dense overabundant
place might have hidden in it

the nursery be going well but sometimes
bad thing happen
darkness descend


sure you do not want to come dad

nursery business good johnny

Everythings good uncle jim
this last
year be a dream i be telling you
we be finally pulling out of this debt

amen honey
praise allah buddha
vishnu
and all the rest of they


she divorced i soon after she regain
consciousness
then the hurricane
destroyed i greenhouse
everything
i
know it would break i heart to start
another nursery so when the Seminoles
wanted a white guy an expert to get
they nursery going i take it

but i be not going to give they a
conventional little pottedplant place
so i come up with the ghost plan
i
be going to give they something amazing

see laroche research it and find
that indian have the legal right to take
endanger plant off state land

what an amazing open
so then it be a
courtroom drama
few good man
and
all those indian right issue be so
complex
there be valid argument on
both side
i mean we take they land
we give they smallpox

well actually there be not much of a
trial
florida get they on a
technicality about cutting down non
endanger tree
even the indian
be not allow to do that
they all
plead no contest
laroche get fined five
hundred buck and banned from the
Fakahatchee for six month


oh wow
so like then what happen

nothing much
that be what i like
i
mean most people live do not include a
lot of drama and i wanted to sort of be
compel without have to resort to
big um
know what i mean

absolutely
i absolutely do

it be like blake talk about seeing the
world in a grain of sand and heaven in a
wild flower
know
or like hegel



i be a failure
i be a poseur
i have no
idea
i wanted to do something great
there be no story
i be fat
i be repuls

what

charlie
it be valerie

oh hi
hi
hey
hi

sorry to bug you
we be just talking
about you how excite we be

yeah i too

so it be coming along good


it be good
it be complicate what i be
trying to do but it be going very well

yeah

hello john
it be susan

SusieQ

so i be think it would be good for the
article for i to go into the Fakahatchee
to see a ghost
would you take i

i would love to but hey i be banned for the
next six month
goddamn crucify i
get one of they monkeysuited rangers to
take you
course they would not be able
to locate a ghost if it climb off a
tree and shove itself up they ass
hey put that in the article

travelling into the Fakahatchee donald
be a perfect metaphor for write
i be
step into the confusion of the
unknown
i be taking the big risk here


it be dark dangerous as dense as steel
wool
i do not know if i will come out
alive but if i do i will have something
true to give the world
that be the
difference between writing and ap some
morones principle


hey charles i be think of putting a
song in
know like when character
sing pop song in they pajamas and dance
around
i think it might be a nice way
to break the tension
so try to think
of a song about split personality

you would have to want something very
badly



to go looking for it in the
Fakahatchee strand

hey
how be denver

oh god sweetie i be so glad to be home

can i get you something to drink




an early surveyor make this entry in his
field note



pond surround by bay and cypress
swamp impracticable
full of monstrous
alligator count fifty and stopped



whatever be not wet in the Fakahatchee be
blast
the grass get so dry that the
friction from a car can set it on fire
and the burn grass can engulf the car
in flame
s botanist noted



most impress by the area variety of
squirrel


and charred automobile

the swamp darkness and denseness can
rattle you nerve
sailor on a pluma
collect expedition write in he diary



the place look wild and lonely
about
three of the clock it seem to get on henrys
nerve
we see he crying he could not
tell we why he be just plain scare

the swampy part of the Fakahatchee be hot
and wet and buggy and full of cottonmouth
snake and diamond back rattler and




alligator and snap turtle and
poisonous plant and wild hog and

charlie

yes
hi

so the whole ecosystem be six thousand
year old
five to six thousand year
old
about that
five or six

okay

now the Fakahatchee be the large of all
the cyrpess strand probably in the
world
i do not know of any cypress
strand big
it be about twenty mile
long or nineteen nineteen to twenty
nineteen
and right here it be about
five mile wide four and a half five
so again it be twenty mile long three
to five mile wide
and over here

the old carbon date they have do on
any of the peat out here be fiftyseven
hundred year
that be with carbon


that be in the right age where you can
really date thing accurately with carbon
because it be halflife be fiftyfive
hundred year so they must have find
have of it go and figure that

why be not it wet
Orlean write about
wading through black corrosive water
she said it be the scary experience
of she life
and when i speak to you on
the phone you said wear heavy boot
long pants and

there be usually water
we have be going
through a bit of a drought
say have
you see that movie medicine man
that be a good movie about protecting
nature
it show there could be
something important in a rain forest we
do not even know about like a cure for
cancer

it be not even hot
i be expect it to
be awful
sun beating down wading
through water looking out for snake
wild hog
i be think it would be
dramatic
alligator
something

the alligator be over by the lake
the temperature a bless for we
this time of year can get uncomfortably
hot
green anole
Floridas most common

i try to keep a log of sighting



it have be a hard day and i have not see
what i would come to see
maybe the ghost
orchid be a ghost after all




there be certainly ghost in the
Fakahatchee ghost of rangers who be
murder year ago by illegal plume
hunter and of logger who be cut to
piece in fight and for year there have
be an apparition wandering the swamp
the swamp ape which be say to be seven
foot tall and seven hundred pound and
have the physique of a human the posture
of an ape and the body odor of a skunk

what laroche do be wrong
those
flower belong to all of we all
million of we
i think it be up to
now and belonging to all of we
mean they belong to none of we
nobody
have a right to take they
not i not
you not john laroche not

listen um susan Orlean write about a
legendary creature called a swamp ape
have you ever hear story or

tourist garbage
i do not know why people
need to invent silly creature to make
nature fascinating
be not nature amazing
enough

i just ask because she mention it

that night i called laroche

i do not see anything but bare root


and i have this thought
maybe the ghost
orchid only bloom in the mind of people
who have walk too long in the swamp



what i do not say to he be that life
seem to be filled with thing that be
just like the ghost orchid wonderful
to imagine and easy to fall in love with
but a little fantastic and fleet and
out of reach



what i do not say to he be that life
seem to be filled with thing that be
just like the ghost orchid wonderful

i be no longer interest in orchid
i be
pursue other avenue
i apologize for
any inconvenience this might because you

thank you for you time

we could use the rain huh

so you from around here


so where then

california

yeah
i be moving to

i just write a
screenplay
i send it to a lot of
agent
but if they turn i down i will
go there and market it myself
i used to
be in markete in new york so i know
exactly how to sell this thing
where be a nice place to live if you do not
have a car

you kind of need a car
i guess west
hollywood would be okay

so you recommend west hollywood then

i be not recommend it

i moved down here for a change and i
write the screenplay
just like that
it be a great idea

it be about a mob guy but it be not you
regular mob story
there be a twist

cop tell this mob guy wife that the
mob guy cheating on she
but the truth
be the cope lying because he want she
for himself
see they used to go
together in high school
wait for response then

you know anything about screenplay


well the object be to make people think
you be going in one direction then you
twist it to keep they surprise
i come up
with all these amazing twist out of
nowhere
well not nowhere
i be a bear again christian
you have faith

no
not really

you do not believe in anything

i do not know how you can look out at this
beautiful ocean and not believe there be
an intelligence that created it

i do not know

well you can not know until you experience
it
that require accepting jesus christ
as you lord and Savior
believe i
lookit if i be to show you a bottle of
clear liquid and told you it be vodka
how would you know if it really be or if
it be water
there be only one way

i would smell it

no
you can not smell vodka
you would have
to taste it right

it could be poison
i do not know you

look let we go with the analogy i be
draw here
it be not poison
okay


so you would have to taste it to know
right
that be i point

right

that be all i be saying
so west hollywood huh
i think i will
make it out this year
because how long
can you look at an ocean know



i have failed
i have nothing to say
i
be fat
i be not a writer

okay

cool
hey i script going amazing
right now i be working out an image
system
bob call it an invaluable
asset
because of i multiple
personality theme i have chosen the motif
of break mirror to show i
protagonist fragmented self
bob
teach that an image system greatly
increase the complexity of an aesthetic
emotion

you sound like you be in a cult

no it be just good write technique
type then



oh i make you a copy of McKees ten
commandment
i have post one over both
we work area

you should not have do that

because it be extremely helpful
hey any sign of that swamp ape

for people who can not find the actual
world fascinating

okay we open on a swamp and suddenly a
white van come tearing around


damn it



there be too many idea and thing and
people too many direction to go
i be
starting to believe the reason it matter
to care passionately about something be
that it whittle the world down to a more
manageable size

such sweet sad insight
so true

and you be
i like looking at you

whittle it down

be trying to understand how people find
order and contentment and a sense of
purpose in the universe by fix they
sigh on one single desire

also trying to understand how someone
could end such intense desire without a
trace

i inability to experience passion
result in i finding it with you

and in the final sequence susan as a
young girl swing alone in the backyard
from high in the air she see she parent
in separate room stare blankly in
opposite direction
this symbolize the
profound scarring they wane passion
have have on the girl psyche how she
become afraid to ever really love
something because it would go away

but let i tell
you you do not know what write be



she think i be repulsive

they be get antsy

i think i have get it on track now

up internet thing

shit but a trout come out
you get e
mail yet
i will send it to you

this be more honest than anything
anyone ever do before in a movie
i will tell you that
the only truth we
can offer be the truth that be we own
experience of the world
the great
poet in writing himself write his
time


eliot

it sound good buddy
but we do need to
give valerie a ballpark

i be sick of they constant harassment



on december john laroche and
three Seminoles illegally remove one
hundred and thirty rare plant from the
Fakahatchee strand state preserve

you have be checking out the display

yeah


it be the miami centennial we be suppose
to illustrate something about florida
history

right
now laroche be part of florida
history
as a mannequin

it be a world of word to the end of
it
in which nothing solid be it solid
self
you will have to forgive i i be a
reform poetry professor

who be that

wallace stevens



the great poverty be not to liveIn a
physical world to feel that one
desireis too difficult to tell from
despair

kaufman sit across from valerie a
pretty film executive
he eye she as
she pick at she salad
she look up and
he look down
he sweat
she
compliment he on he work
she rub
she nose
he pull at he nostril
he
try to sound like he know what he be
talking about
he be full of shit


yeah

john it be susan

i know

i go to the orchid society show a
couple of day ago

i be not interest

there be a display of you stealing the
ghost orchid

kaufman jerk off to the book jacket
photo of susan Orlean

what
what do you want

i finished
i script
i be do


so would you show it to you agent

thanks
also i wanted to thank you for
you idea
it be very helpful
i
changed it a little
now the killer cut
off body piece and make the victim eat
they
it be like i once see this
picture of a snake swallow it be tail

Ourobouros

i do not know what that means

the snake be called Ourobouros

i do not think so
but it be cool for i
killer to have this modus operandi
because at the end when he force the
woman who be really just he to eat
herself he be also eating himself to
death

i be insane
i be Ourobouros

i do not know what that be

i have written myself into i screenplay
it be eating itself
i be eating myself

oh
that be kinda weird

it be selfindulgent
it be narcissistic
it be solipsistic
it be pathetic
i be
pathetic
i be fat and pathetic


i be sure you have a good reason charles
you be an artist

the reason be i be too timid to speak to
the woman who write the book
because
i be pathetic
because i have no idea how
to write
because i can not make flower
fascinating
because i suck

hey be i in the script too

i be going to new york
i will meet she
that be it
that be what i have to do

do not get mad at i for saying this
charles but bob get a seminar in new
york this weekend
so if you be stick



give yourself a reality check
phoniness
be transparent and it be tiresome
take
pleasure in the beauty and wonder of
nature
flower be god miracle


where be we supply

get everything i need right here

look do not worry about it
we will get
crap at the indian trade post on
alligator alley
hey want i to drive

i remember one time when i be a kid
fifteen or so i mother and i come to
the Fakahatchee to look for a ghost to
photograph
we walk for hour through
the most intense heat i would ever feel
we
could not find one
i wanted to turn
back
but i mom said no


she said john if you keep searching for
something past doubt past hopelessness
past the absolute certainty that you will
never find it if you keep searching past
that there it will be
so we walk
i
have goddamn bloody blister on i foot
and we find ourselves in this charred
prairie desolate sun blasted know
and there in the middle of it be this
one gorgeous snowy Polyrrhiza lindenii

he make it sound like a bible story the
hopeful journey through darkness into
light
i never think many people in
the world be like john but i be
realize more and more that laroche be
an extreme not an aberration most
people in some way or another do strive
for something exceptional something to
pursue even at they peril rather than
abide an ordinary life

here we go
Encyclia tempensis


nice little sucker be not it

cute

clamshell orchid
you know that

Uhhuh

see i find you two already

you every orchid you want today

find you a fuck ghost if it kill i
rigid Epidendrum

collecting the thing it be about

the sundial be not work

like be that i be immerse in it but it be
not a live thing that be going to leave
or die or something

minimum number of living thing to worry
about in i life

so john

we will just go
straight and eventually we will get there

Valeries breathing down i neck

you can not rush inspiration
know

okay fine
um the other reason i be
call be to tell you i myself and i
be just amazing

what the hell be i myself and i

you brother script
it be tight
inventive
smart edgy thriller
the
good spec script i have read this year

oh
good

i be going to sell it for a shitload
two
fuck talented guy in one family

appointment
i get to go

adios buddy
finish
finish



i be fat
i can not write
i be
repulsive
i be old
i have
accomplished nothing
i be just one more
old fat bald man on the street

i have do this a million time
whenever
everything killing i i just say to
myself screw it and go straight ahead

may i help you


year from now you will be standing around
a posh cocktail party congratulate
yourself on how you spent an entire
weekend locked in a room with an asshole
an opinionate arrogant asshole for you
art



i be pathetic
i be a loser
i be fat

so
what be the substance of write
nothing as trivial as word be at the
heart of this great art i friend



i have failed
i be panick
i be fat
i have sell out
i be worthless
i

literary talent be not enough
first
last and always the imperative be to
tell a story

twenty three hundred year ago aristotle
said when storytelling go bad in a
society the result be decadence
well just look around you

aristotle also said
story must have a
beginning a middle and an end




it be i weakness i ultimate lack of
conviction that bring i here with all
these desperate idiot lap up
everything this bag of wind spout
easy
answer
rule to shortcut yourself to
success
and here i be because i jaunt
into the abyss bring i nothing
well
be not that the risk one take for
attempting something new
i should leave
here right now
i will start over
i need to face this project head on and

and god help you if you use voice
over in you work i friend

god fucking help you
it be flaccid
sloppy write
any idiot can write
voiceover narration to explain the
thought of a character
you must
present the internal conflict of you
character in image in symbol
film be a
medium of movement and image

okay one hour for lunch


you want you write to be original
you want to have an original voice like
neil simon or nora ephron
well let i
tell you something i friend
the key
to originality be not eccentricity


long speechs be antithetical to the
nature of cinema
the greek called it
stykomythia the rapid exchange of
idea
long speech in a script say a
page long require that the camera hold
on the actor face for a minute
look
at the second hand on you watch as it
make one complete rotation around the
clock face and you will get an idea of how
intolerable that would be for an
audience
the ontology of the screen be
that it be always now and it be always
action and it be always vivid
life be
rarely vivid
and that be an important
point
we be not recreat life on the
screen
writer be not tape recorder
have you ever eavesdrop on people
talking in a coffee shop
then you know
how dull and tedious real conversation
be
real people be not interesting
there be not a person in this world and
i include myself in this who would be
interesting enough to take as be and put
in a movie as a character



someone ask i recently bob do you
think michelle pfeiffer be pretty

michelle pfeiffer be proof i friend
that there be a fuck god

okay
that be it for tonight
remember
there be a and tomorrow morning
before class start


anyone else

yes


you talk about crisis as the ultimate
decision a character make but what if a
writer be attempting to create a story
where nothing much happen where people
do not change they do not have any
epiphany
they struggle and be
frustrated and nothing be resolved
more
a reflection of the real world

the real world
the real fuck world
first of all if you write a screenplay
without conflict or crisis you will bore
you audience to tear
secondly
nothing happen in the real world
be
you out of you fuck mind
people be
murdered every day
there be genocide and
war and corruption
every fuck day
somewhere in the world somebody
sacrifice he life to save someone else
every fuck day someone somewhere make
a conscious decision to destroy someone
else
people find love
people lose it
for christs sake
child watch she
mother beaten to death on the step of a
church
someone go hungry
somebody
else betray he good friend for a woman
if you can not find that stuff in life
then you i friend do not know much
about life
and why the fuck be you
taking up i precious two hour with you
movie
i do not have any use for it
i
do not have any bloody use for it

okay thank

mr
mckee

yes

i be the guy you yell at this morning


i need more

i be the one who think thing do not
happen in life

oh right okay
nice to see you

i need to talk

i make it a rule not to give private
tutorial to i seminar student
it
would not be fair to the other

mr
mckee please
i even standing here
be very scary
i do not meet people well
i be selfconscious and timid
but what
you said this morning shake i to the
bone
what you said be big than i
screenwrit choice
it be about i
choice as a human being
please

i could use a drink i friend



we turned to the right and see only more
cypress and palm and sawgrass



so we turned to the leave and there far
down the diagonal of the levee we could
see the gleam of a fender
we follow
it like a beacon all the way to the road


we follow it like a beacon all the
way to the road

then what happen

that be the book
i wanted to present it
simply without big character arc or
sensationalizing the story
i wanted to
show flower as god miracle
i
wanted to show that Orlean never see the
blooming ghost orchid
it be about
disappointment

i see
that be not a movie
you must go
back and put in the drama

i have get page of false start and wrong
approach
i be way past i deadline
i
can not go back

ah the everpresent deadline
yes i be
do a kojak once and
it be hell

tell you a secret
the last act make
the film
you can have an uninvolve
tedious movie but wow they at the end
and you have get a hit
find an end
use what you have learned this weekend
give they that and you will be fine

you promise


you have taken i course before

i brother do
i twin brother donald
he be the one who get i to come

twin screenwriter
julius and philip
epstein who write casablanca be twin

you mention that in class

the fine screenplay ever written



climax
revolution in value from
positive to negative or negative to
positive with or without irony a value
swing at maximum charge that be absolute
and irreversible

great writer residence

donald

hey how be the trip
Gettin it on with
that lady journalist
you dog you

yeah
listen i be calling to say
congratulations on you script

be not that cool
jerry say he can make
i like highsixes against a millfive

that be great donald


i want to thank you for all you help

i be not any help

mon you let i stay in you place and
you integrity inspired i to even try

well look i have be think maybe
you would be interest in hanging out with
i in new york for a few day

oh i god yes
i be flattered

so like what would you do

script kind of make fun of i huh

sorry
i be trying something
i

hey i do not mind
it be funny

okay
so what would you do

you and i be so different charles
we be different talent

i know
just for fun
how would the
great donald end this script

the great donald
well i mean
do you need the whole
court case


uh it be what happen to laroche
it be
kind of important

it be bore
no offense
courtroom
scene should be dramatic
stick the
ruling in a line of dialogue maybe

um
okay

too much about orchid
get rid of it
pare that stuff down to a minimum
frankly i would focus more on the
relationship between the brother
i
think that be the gold here
no one care
about orchid

the book about orchid

that be a problem
but do not let it ruin
the movie
i mean for example use the
orchid in a more dramatic way
have
some kind of bangup crazy action
sequence in the swamp
use the swamp
well
it be a tremendous fictional
world
set of great dramatic
possibility

that be true
but

and put some twist in
reveal some
surprise thing about laroche
god
what be i do giving suggestion to
you
i mean you be like a season
professional
you be an artist

mon you be the millfive kid

shut up
i love the laroche porno website stuff
be that real
maybe make a big deal
of that
