sorry for the way i have be since
that stupid play
i be sorry for
everything and
and i love
you
now wait here till i call
you
okay



alright frank
you can come in
now


frank
i have have the most
wonderful idea
i have be think
about it all day

what be all this about

you know how much money we have
saved

enough to live on for six month
without you earn another dime
and with the money we could get
from the house and the car longer
than that

what we get for the house
what
be you talking about
where be
we going to live

paris

you always said it be the only
place you would ever be that be
worth live
so why do not we go
there


you be serious

yes
what be stopping we

what be stopping we
well i can
think of a lot of thing
for
instance what kind of a job could
i possibly get

you will not be get any kind of
job because i will

oh right

do not laugh listen a minute
have you any idea what they pay for
secretarial position in the
government agency in europe
embassy and those thing

no i do not

i be serious about this frank
do
you think i be kidding or something

no i know i know
i just have a
couple of question be all
for
one thing do you mind telling i
what exactly i be suppose to be
do while you be out earn all
this money


do not you see that be the whole
idea
you will be do what you
should have be allow to do seven
year ago
you will have time
frank
you will have time to find
out what it be that you actually
want to do and when you figure it
out you will have the time and the
freedom to start do it

sweetheart it be just not very
realistic be all

well i happen to think this be
unrealistic
i think it be
unrealistic for a man with a fine
mind to go on working like a dog
year after year at a job he can not
stand coming home to a place he
can not stand to a wife who be
equally unable to stand the same
thing

you want to know the bad part
we whole existence here be base
on this great premise that we be
somehow very special and superior
to the whole thing and you know
what i have realized
we be not
we be just like everyone else
look at we
we have buy into the
same ridiculous delusion
this
idea that you have to resign from
life and settle down the moment you
have child
and we have be
punishing each other for it

listen
we decided to move out
here
no one ever forced i to
take the job at knox


i mean who ever said i be suppose
to be a big deal anyway

when i first meet you there be
nothing in the world you could not
do or be

i be a little wise guy with a big
mouth that be all

you be not
how can you even say
that

all right
so i will have
time
and god know that be
appeal
it be very appeal
and i mean everything you say
might make a certain amount of
sense if i have some definite
talent maybe
if i be an artist
or a writer

but frank listen to i
it be what
you be that be be stifle here
it be what you be that be be
denied and denied and denied in
this kind of life

and what be that

do not you know

you be the most valuable and
wonderful thing in the world
you be a man


this be we chance frank
this be
we one chance

okay

okay

why not
why the hell not

ah franklin
good to see you
shine face
what be the news

i be moving to paris

right
and i be moving to tangiers


Intracompany letter to
toledo
attention

chalmers
branch manager
with regard to
recent and repeat correspondence
this be to advise that the matter
have be
very satisfactorily
taken in hand period paragraph

we wholly agree that the exist
brochure be unsuitable
to this
end we have developed

speaking of production control




here you be mrs
wheeler

ask for
and you steamer
reservation
and these i will pass
on to the embassy for you

thank you


good luck

and when do this noble experiment
commence

september
october at the outside

i just happen to think people be
well off do some kind of work
they actually like

right yes

absolutely absolutely

but
i mean assuming there be a
true vocation waiting for you
would not you be just as likely to
discover it here as there


no
i do not think it be possible
to discover anything on the
fifteenth floor of the knox
build and i do not think any of
you do either

this one on i


all the way to
here

but why

well sweetheart
it be a big world
out there and we think maybe we
should go see a little bit of it

how far be it

long way
we have to take a
boat ride over the sea to get
there

i will not know anyone there

i know
and neither will i
but
remember when you start school
and now look how many friend you
have


you will never guess what they eat in
paris
you will never guess

what

snail

snail

and frog leg

Buddappa banh
banh
banh

canary

tell we
little bit of news

not to pry or anything

i be not prying
be i prying
i
do not mean to

actually we have get some pretty
important news

you want to tell em

we be going to europe
to paris
to live

what


when

why

september

but what for

what for
because we have always
wanted to
because the kid be
still young
because it be
beautiful
shep you tell she

it be a great city

when do you make this decision

oh
about a week ago
it hard
to remember
we just suddenly
decided to go that be all

about a week ago and you tell we
now

we have to get used to the idea

so what be the deal frank
you

not exactly

what do you mean not exactly


frank will not be do any kind of a
job because i will

and what be you going to do

i be going to study
and i be going
to read and
i suppose i be going
to finally figure out what i want
to do with i life

while she support you

yes
while she support i
at
least in the begin

you would not believe what they pay
for secretarial work in government
agency over there
and



and those place

the cost of live be dirt cheap
compare to here so we should be
all right

the truth be we just need something
different


we be not get any young and
we do not want life to just pass we
by

you know what this be like april

it be incredible
i knock this
thing off in a couple of minute

you think

she okay

i think you turned the job down

with the money they be
talking thing could be different
for we here

place
travel

it be possible that parisian

to lead interesting live april

no
like i said it be an option

and supposing you be right
you

i be going
to get wet

you know you really be be
melodramatic about the whole thing
as long as it be do in the first
twelve week it be perfectly safe

that be now april
do not i get a
say

of course you do
it would be for
you frank do not you see

you make it sound
like have child be a
punishment

what the hell be that suppose to
mean

april you just said we daughter

sane mother do not buy herself a
piece of rubber tubing to give
herself an abortion so she can go
live out some god damn fantasy

all i be saying be you do not seem
entirely rational about this
thing
and maybe we should get
someone to help you think about it

and the new job going to pay
for that too

april if you need a shrink it will
be paid for

strain
i mean i know you be

you know i be not sleeping with you
and you want to know why


well i be sorry frank but i do not
really feel like talking about it

what do you feel like
talking about

would it be all right if we do not
talk about anything
can not we just
take each day as it come and do
the good we can and not feel we
have to talk about everything all
the time

i do not think i suggested we talk
about everything all the time
i
point be we have both be under a
strain and we ought to be trying to
help each other as much as we can
right now

i mean god know i own behavior
have be pretty weird lately
i
mean as it happen
there be
actually something i would like to tell
you about

i have be with a girl in the city a
few time


girl i hardly even know
it be
nothing to i but she get a little
carry away
she be just a kid
anyway it be over now
it be really
over
if i be not sure of that i
guess i could never have tell you
about it

why do you

baby i do not know
i think it be
a simple case of wanting to be a
man again after all that abortion
business
some kind of neurotic
irrational need to prove something

no
i do not mean why do you have
the girl
i mean why do you tell
i about it

i mean what be the point
be it
suppose to make i jealous or
something
be it suppose to make
i fall in love with you or back
into bed with you or what
i mean
what be i suppose to say

why do not you say what you feel

i do not feel anything

in other word you do not care what
i do or who i fuck or anything


no
i guess that be right
i do not

fuck who you like

do not you see
do not you see i
want you to care

oh i know you do
and i suppose i
would if i loved you
but you see
i do not think i do anymore
and i
only just figure that out
and
that be why i would just as soon not do
any talking right now

oh now do not give i this shit
you know god damn well you love i

you think so

you know




yoohoo

really do not need to go through
all the trouble of cook
i can
see you have a lot to do with
pack and what not

oh john really
i do not think we
need to

i be asking the man a question
if
he do not want to give i the
answer i be assuming he will have
sense enough to tell i so

suppose we just say that people
anywhere be not very well advise
to have baby unless they can
afford they

okay
okay
it be a question of
money
money always a good
reason

but it be hardly ever the real
reason
what be the real reason
wife talk you out of it or what

little woman decide she be not quite
ready to quit play house

i can
tell
she look too tough

little house for year and the
brace be the first really
suitable people i have ever find for
it
really nice congenial people

oh i be very fond of the wheelers
but they always be a bit a bit
whimsical for i taste
bit
neurotic
i may not have stressed
it but they be often very trying
people to deal with in many way



actually the main reason the
little house have be so hard to
sell be that they let it depreciate
so dreadfully
warp window
frame wet cellar crayon mark on
the wall filthy smudge around
all the
