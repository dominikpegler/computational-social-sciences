dry powder extinguisher
covering NIKIs helmet
blur he vision as he cry out
in agony inhale the powder
scream voice
panicked reaction
on the side of the car
the painted name niki lauda blister and melt



then sound fade
as black out losing consciousness

over this
the sound of a ring phone


we be in a busy hospital unit
noise
crowd
regular
saturday late afternoon
the phone continue to ring
finally an attractive station in she s runoffher
foot breathlessly pick up the phone

standing by
the hang up
then call out to she and
colleague

that be the racetrack
there be
be an accident

injured and be on he way in
instantly the atmosphere change
hive of activity as
and prepare themselves for a major trauma
all with minor injury be clear out of the way
the ring upstairs to the operate theatre and
consultant surgeon telling they to stand by


swing door open and a pair of shoeless walk
through and into the accident and emergency unit
camera tilt up a pair of long leg in white race
overall
to reveal a tall goodlooking driver
tan athletic surfer long blonde hair
man about whom a word come to mind one would rarely use to
describe an englishman

blood trickle from he nose there be bruise to he lip and
the formation of a nasty black eye but make no
mistake
he rock
Dropdead gorgeous




i think the racetrack telephone ahead
that i be coming

of blood before

be you all right

empty beer
can
toaster
kettle

cage contain two
budgerigar
mattress on the floor
newspaper with headline about the docker strike englands
crumble economy rolls royce be bail out by the
government subtle reminder of britain in transition
leaving behind it strong imperial past
and the stand against the wall still half
dressed but already passionately making love

i have a theory why woman like racing
driver
it be not because they respect
what we do
driving round and round
in circle
mostly they think that be
pathetic
and they be probably right
it be we closeness to death
and the continue noisily tirelessly making love
in the shower

the close you be to death the more
alive you
the more alive you

and they can see that in you
that in you
the way you live
willing to risk everything




with no thought for tomorrow
as if
each day be you last
it be a
wonderful way to live
and the
way to drive
the only way to get that
tenth of a second on everyone else
the lovemake become more intense

to dare to be one step bold
one
step fast
be covered in perspiration out on the edge

sure one step closer to death
and the both screaming as they approach orgasm

but one step closer to victory too
and the both climax together
and collapse on the
bed
exhausted

i
right now with zero incentive or
reward why would i drive fast
look at he with she dark green eye

on equal term
the way it be in formula i would beat
you and you know it

never
you might get lucky and win one
race
maybe two
because you be
aggressive

because you be not serious
you be
just a party guy
which be why
everyone like you

now try saying that and tell i you be
not jealous

wheel
we get an extra half second
speed on each lap
but the old man

bad loser who can not accept that
Komm he be crazy

you do not want i back
you never
wanted to be marry in the first
place
you do it because you hope it
might change you
settle you down

not because you
loved i
and who know if it have
be just the drink or the dope
or the infidelity or the mood

all of they

i know
i be terrible

situation and how it look
have
raid you larder

win of i career























following an inquiry into the
disqualification of driver james hunt
from the spanish grand prix it have
be decided to overturn this
disqualification
and to restore his
victory and reinstate he point






james a few week ago you be
out of the run for this season
completely now you be right back in
it
what be changed

combination of factor not all of
which i be prepare to discuss here
justice be do re
the
disqualification in spain help and
have i old car back of course




mathematically in theory it be now
possible for hunt to catch you
be
you worried

not at all
for he to catch i he would
have to win all the remain race
and i would have to lose they
and pig
would have to fly

now if you will excuse i i have a
private family matter to attend to
















come to bed

what be the matter

it be the enemy you know
happiness

it weaken you
put doubt in you
mind
because all of a sudden you have
something to lose

when you call happiness an enemy then
it be too late
then you have lost already












we have just be tell a driver
meet have be called

who by

niki






thank you
i called this meet
because as all driver know the
nurburgring be a race track from the
stone age
the most stupid barbaric
outdate dangerous track in the
world
you have all see the rain which
have be falling this morning
those
of you with experience know the ring
need perfect condition to be even
remotely acceptable in term of risk
as you can see today be anything
perfect so i called this meet to
take a vote to cancel the race

there would be no change to the
situation as far as point be
concern
the race would simply be
cancel

this be bullshit

if the race be cancel none of we
get we race fee

it be true
you leave without you fee
but you might leave with you

it also mean you would effectively
win the championship

so i can see why this suit you just
fine

why
there would be no point for i
either




but there would be one race less where
i or anyone else could catch you

james be right
this be just tactic

ferraris dirty trick
we have see it
before

maybe it be just that he be frighten

which asshole said this

yes i be frighten
always a little
bit when i race
i accept every time i
get in i car there be chance that
i could die
but not one per cent
more
and today with the rain the
risk more
how dare you accuse i
of lack of courage
let i remind you
i have the track record here
i be the
only person in history to do the ring
in under minute
so actually it be
to i to race here today
because i be quick than all of you

fine
then let we race

there be a hundred thousand fan out
there who would never forgive we if we
do not

and some of we need we race fee




all those in favour of cancel the
race

all those in favour of race
