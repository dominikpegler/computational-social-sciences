who s that

not you business
not anymore

touche

so you calling about anything in
particular or be you just hope to
catch i sleeping in the nude

i cracked the reversion

you cracked it

look at this

watch this

you sure

sure

eleven month with no progress and you
suddenly come up with it out of the
blue
how

the usual
coffee and twinkies

i hate you

i know
you think you could hunt down
matt and get to the lab early
i want
isabelle prep for a live test

yeah i think i can find he
what be
you going to do

well y know
it s daylight in
switzerland
i get to call the nobel
committee and tell they to get we
prize ready
see you in a few

hey
come on

what

sebastian just called
we get to get to
the lab

shit
you didn t tell he i be here
do you

give i some credit will you

so what s the rush

he cracked reversion

want to ride down

we well take we own car

you re going to have to tell he about we
eventually

i know
it s just you re he good
friend
he ll feel betrayed

morning sir

she bite i

yeah
she s become a lot more

go take care of that bite
i ll get
she

and give you a chance to pull ahead
never

shh
be vewy vewy quiet
i m hunt
simians
heheheheh

knock it off
isabelle

good shootin tex

what s that make it

i m still ahead
to

but i m catching up

can i have a word

most normal people say good morning

don t you think you should test the
protocol on the liver sample before
you inject isabelle

how many tissue sample have we
successfully regress
hundreds
right
how many have go on to work
on the full system
none

that s beside the point

no that be the point
i m not going
to waste six month of i life on an
outmoded test procedure
this thing
works
i know it
i feel it

fine
you can mop up afterward

you think i m going to kill isabelle

kill
more like liquefy

sarah thank you for you opinion but
i m the project leader
understand

yes sir

how do you ever convince i to hire
she

you said you wanted the beat vet in
the country

yeah well she care more about the
animal than the research

maybe that s why she s so good

who da man
you da man

as we pull out we see we be

protocol be hot

vital

normal







how many time do i have to tell you
frank you aren t god
i be

sorry boss
forget

you guy ready to roll

we be live and in color
on you
mark

okay
roll em

okay
we be rolling record on video
one through twelve



subject isabelle two
currently in
phase shift
one hundred twenty six
day eighteen hour

test DePhase protocol
inject
serial protein caine one two five

maybe if you stopped name they after
yourself you d have good luck

why thank you dr
kensington for
that keen scientific observation
i ll
be sure to include it in i memoir

whole mention
and i think i be
just going to be a footnote

okay

ready

prop

let s make some history

nice try sparky

come on isabelle
you can do this

elevated heartbeat

we re still in the green

confirm
vital still in the normal
range

it s react

do you see this

it s work
it s actually work

heart rate s up
she s scare

it be okay baby
it be okay

subject begin manifest almost
immediately
protocol be react
quickly

subject may be in pain or extreme
discomfort

Goddamnit
blood pressure elevate
brain activity going through the roof

we ve get a problem

what
what problem

it s she heart
we can see the heart
beating in the ape s



i get an erratic heart beat

she s going into cardiac arrest

get the crash cart

we re losing she

no
it s get to work

clear

we ve get something

still
erratic

come on isabelle
come on
you can do
it
you can fucking do it

come on monkey

do it
do it
come on

stabilize



brain activity returning to normal

welcome back isabelle

how be she

i think she s going to be okay

amaze
she be normal absolutely
healthy
if you do not know any
well you would think nothing have
happen to she

yeah
i can not wait to slice up she
brain and trace she neural pathway

screw you matt

well maybe not right away

we should celebrate

to the fine research team i have ever
known

hey

i think you would go

where would i go

twenty year ago there be no
computer no fax machine no cell
phone
i be just wonder what the
world will be like twenty year from
now
if what we be do will change
everything

little i be become death
the
shatterer of world

something like that

since the day i meet all you wanted to
do be change the world

listen i know we have
i mean
well
i just want you to know how proud
i be of you
i know it probably
do not mean a lot

actually it do
i guess since you be there from the
begin you know i good than
anyone else on this godforsaken
planet

you be positively maudlin
you should
be happy
do you have any idea what
you have accomplished

yeah
but i be working so hard i
do not realize i would have no one to
share it with

i do not suppose we could turn back the
clock for a night and you could come
home with i

right
sorry
too much champagne

what be that about

nothing
it be just
he be who he be
sometimes i just have to be remind

what be it like
talk goddamnit
tell
i what it be like



six year ago this committee
commission i with a very specific
task

to successful phaseshift a human
be out of quantum sync with the
visible universe and then return he
safely with no after affect

well we find out sending they to
neverneverland be easy it be the
get back that be hard

every time we have tried to bring a test
subject back from phaseshift
cellular bond would dissolve the
primary strand would decay
but
now

but now

but now

but now
but now we feel we be close than
ever to resolve this issue
we have
be experiment with a new
regression formula that look rather
promise
lean forward

how long

sir

son as you can imagine we be very
anxious to field test this tactical
asset
how long till you resolve this
issue

should not be more than another year
sir

maybe sooner

yo
reality check
what the hell be
that about

keep you voice down

the protocol work
Whyd you tell
they it do not

i be not ready for they to know

but they be the oversight committee
they be suppose to know

i be sure he have a reason
you do have a reason do not you
sebastian

i have more than a reason
i have a
goddamn epiphany

what do you think they would do if they
know we could send a subject into
phase shift and pull it back out
again
how many second would it take
for they to take over the whole
project bringing in they soldier to
test the formula on
we would have lost
control of it by the end of the week

it be they money sebastian
it be
going to happen eventually

i know
but not yet
there be too much
for we to learn
i do not want i hand
tied by they political agenda when we
go to phase three

well then
mind telling we how
you be going to get a human testsubject
for phase three without the committee
finding out

that be easy
i have decided to test the
procedure

on myself

be you nut

be jonas salk nut

yeah
pretty sure he be

and remember for every jonas salk
there be a bunch of guy who be not
famous cuz they die

if we be that unsure how can we
morally justify testing it on someone
else

be not it a little soon to be moving
into phase three anyway

she be right
we have not even finished
collate the phase two research

we will have plenty of time to collate
and crossreference later
monkey data
do not matter anyway
the only real
data be human data

you do not even know if any of the
protocol will work on human

how be we going to find out
besides
we have succeed with a gorilla and
they be the same as human
and the be not that significant

sebastian
human can talk build
house and cook in microwave oven
gorilla live in tree
that be a
helluva if you ask i

we be all concern
i know that
but
if we be going to move forward ever this
be something we have to do

why you
why not one of we

the risk
i could not ask

what if we volunteer

what if you be too valuable to lose

i be project leader
it be i formula
and i call
the good way to express
you concern be to make damn sure you
do you good work
i will want about
four week to

to put you affair in order

to run some more reversion and tissue
test and then we will attempt the phase
shift
i will stay shift for three
day of test and then we will perform
a quantum regression

come in

what

in the past six year i have never once
challenged you decision but this
sebastian
i do not think you
should do this

you do not understand

oh please
how long be we together
you must have say it a million time
nobody know who build the lunar
lander
all they remember in the first
man on the moon

but what if something happen to
you
what about the project

lin trust i
nothing going to
happen

he refuse to listen to reason

can we talk about this later
i be
trying to make love to you

sorry
i just can not let it go

i know how you be feeling
hell he
and i have be friend since freshman
year

so how can we let he do this

what if you be given the opportunity
to be the first person on mars would
you go

in a heartbeat

what if they do not know whether or
not they could get you home

this be he chance to be chuck yeager
or christopher columbus
well if i
be he i would do the same thing

let i ask another question

be about who get to be on top

be the human race really ready for
what we be do

why do you always get philosophical
before we be about to get physical

no really
be it ready
we be
barrel down a road that beg moral
and ethical question that i do not
think we can answer

they said the same thing about the
bomb
they said we would never survive the
nuclear age
but here we be

this night be still young
i mean when you think about it it be
creepy
do we really want to live in a
world where people can just disappear
in the blink of an eye

we make we deal with the devil year
ago
might as well stick around to
cash in

yes

we be ready

okay

it be not too late to back out
i be
happy to take you place

no
i be ready

nervous

little

ever tell you the one about superman
and wonder woman

i do not think so

so Supermans flying around the city
and he be horny as hell
lo and behold
he look down and see wonder woman
completely nude sun herself up on
the roof of the justice league
i mean
she be lying there naked and spread
eagle
so superman start think
man
this be too easy
i could go
down there do a little fast pump
and be go before she even see i

after all he be fast than a speeding
bullet right
anyway he swoop down
take care of business so quick you
can not even see he
well
i tell
ya
wonder woman look up surprise
as hell and say what the hell be
that
and the invisible man reply
i dunno know but it sure hurt like
hell


you know that could be the last joke
i ever hear

mon man
that be funny shit



how be you feeling
sebastian take a deep breath

fine

pulse over
bit
elevate

to be expected

no reason for concern
he be ready

hey
it be going to be okay

start recording

we be hot
all system nominal
houston

okay kid
let we make some history

subject
male age weight lb

ready

if the test be any indication it
should work quickly

i will inject myself
if anything go
wrong they can not blame you

we can still shut down sebastian

any last word

yeah
if i be killed pretend i said
something deep and clever

injection be administered at




keep talking
tell we what you be
feel

nothing so far

vital be stable

nothing happening

human structure be slightly more
complex
it be possible that it may
take more time

maybe we overlook something

recheck the protocol
it can not be non
reactive

kinda like a firecracker with a bad
fuse

do not know if it will go off

frank



no change in bioelectric

goddammit

okay wait i arm
it be get a
bit warm
yeah it be
it be
starting to tingle

okay
it be spreading to i back
like like a fever

here we go

shit
it be starting to burn
oh
god
it hurt
i do not think it would
hurt

heartbeat elevated
pulse at


what do you feel
keep talking



pain

pulse be
blood pressure
over


he be going to blow out he heart

prop the crash cart

we have get to stop it

we can not

something happening

listen up
electric activity
increasing in all limb
brainwave
be through the roof

i do not think the human brain could
spike that high

maybe it can not

no
oh god




pulse be
holding stable

holy shit

pulse be dropping




Bioquantum phase shift occur at



be he dead

no
he passed out from the trauma

vital returning to normal
pulse
dropping
blood pressure over




electrical activity be stabilize

pulse steady at

Unfuckingbelievable

you do it sebastian
you be the
first

let we get he into recovery

okay
you nod off

he breathe hypnotic
how longes
it be

seventeen hour

where be the other

in the lab crunch number
we have
get enough data there for two
lifetime of research

i keep looking at that hole wonder
if he be really there

do you see

he may be coming out of it

the light
turn off the goddamn
light
ah christ

i can not
i can not close i eye
i
can not close i eye

you eyelid be transparent

so i
i be

yes

i arm
i can
where

i can feel
they

you arm
you whole body
it
worked sebastian
it worked

mirror
i
i want to see

over here in the corner

what be it like

i
it be hard to think

the transformation
i remember every
molecule in i body shattering

it be painful

at first
but then everything go
black
i could not see or hear or feel
anything
it be all just black
like i be not connected

you system received quite a shock

at least i sense be starting to
return
you be wearing you
shalimar be not you

sebastian

this be weird
i be looking through
myself at the floor
i be looking right
through myself
i can not tell

where i body be

sebastian

sebastian

you really can not see i
can you

give i symptom
dizziness nausea
headache bodyache disorientation

no just tire
it be funny
i can see everything
more than before
but i can not see
myself

hey
how be he do

why do not you ask he

sebastian how do you feel

not to bad consider

odd be not it

he can not close he eye so they be
sensitive to light

so what be it like

over here

mon sebastian
knock it off

sorry
could not resist

i feel like we be playing marco polo

well i see the procedure have not
changed you personality

no worry
i be on it

Gotcha big man

boy you people have no sense of
humor

show i
so

stop there

index that
that be when it start
burn
epidermal reaction

index mark


it be late
time you get some rest

just a little long

hate to pull rank but you be i
patient now and you need rest
we have
get a busy day tomorrow

fine

we have set up a thermal camera for
observation and i have arranged one of
we to be here in case you need
anything
the team going to be on alpha
call alert for the duration
if
anything go wrong we can all be
here within

thirty minute
yes i know
i write
the procedure

i be trying to be reassure

you like this do not you

what be that

be in charge

please
i be just do i job

you going to be okay

shit

dr
caine
sebastian
come on this
be not funny
i know you be in here

i must be going crazy

i find he later in the lab run
sample

why do not you call i

because i be not sure
i be still not
i mean i could have easily be
dreaming

it do not sound like something
sebastian would do

god i feel so stupid

i can talk to he

no
i mean
it be probably nothing
i
should not have mention it

you sure

yeah i be sure
i mean know why
would he do that right
just this
place at night can be kinda creepy
know

so how be you first night

restless
hard to sleep when you can not
close you eye

yeah
Whatd you do

get up a couple of time
knock
about

yeah sarah mention you be not in
you cubicle
she said she called you
over the intercom and you do not
respond

i guess i do not hear
i have the radio
on

it would be helpful to we if you would tell
whoever on duty where you be going
to
i mean if something be to
happen we would want to know where to
find you

i do not think it be a problem

it be not
i just do not want it to
become one

reading be normal

next i want to run a and
analysis of the platelet

we will have to draw some more blood

you okay

yeah
why

you just seem a little nervous

no
i
i be fine
hold still
this
might hurt a bit

dr
caine
this might sound stupid
but be you
be you looking at i

no
i be looking at the clock
why

just feel like someone be stare at
i

sebastian
Goddamnit

you have no idea how much fun i have have
i be going to hate going back

that be what worry i

how so

what happen when we turn the project
over to the army
ever wonder how much
fun they be going to have

maybe we will not give it to they
he
voice come from behind she now

i be think
tonight i last
night
ever fantasize about making
love to an invisible man

stop it sebastian
it be not funny

well do not do it for i
do it for
science

grow up

oh well
miss you big chance

get some sleep
big day tomorrow

record

record
subject doctor sebastian
caine
currently in phase shift
three day seven hour

DePhase protocol
inject serial
protein caine one two seven

ready

not really
i be just starting to
enjoy myself

tough

okay man
here we go

wait
something
something do not
feel right

heartbeat elevate

vital still nominal

i can not br
br

what be wrong

he be not breathing

subject manifest

pulse erratic

carter

sebastian
sebastian

sebastian

get a tranq
stat

he be revert
get he on the table

get i a i

of

seven

i get no pulse
no pulse

start

get a pulse

holy shit
what happen

sebastian
can you hear i
can you
hear i
how be he pupil

i can not see he goddamn pupil

i think he be going into shock



just get the tissue sample result
cellular cohesion be stable

how bout you
you going to be okay

guess so
i be just think about the apollo
mission
know
grissom white and
chaffee
what it be like for they
on that launch pad that day think
they be going to reach the star only
to burn to death

sometimes the test pilot make
history
sometimes the plane crash
and people die

but he do not die do he
what if we can not bring he back
what
then

it be just a little hitch be all
he will
be the first to tell that he will crack
it and i be sure he will
it will just
take time
listen let we get out of here
we
could drive up to the old observatory
we will take some wine and go count the
star and forget all this for awhile

no
i want to be here for he

hey

hey

so i guess it do not work

you look worry
it must have be bad

you almost die

well remember you Nietchze
whatever
do not kill i make i strong

consequence
for the security of this project i be
going to have to ask you to confine
yourself to the compound

i be still project leader linda

i decision to make

you be right
it be you decision
but
if you leave the compound again i will
notify the oversight committee
then

machine

i restructure the third genome on
you radiate protein strand
thought
you might want to take look

it

i trust you

hanging out in the girl locker room
kicking jimmy Margianis ass

jimmy margiani

school asshole
drive a red trans am
back then i be the size of a small
planet and make a rather large target

ever think up anything along the grand
scale

sure
world domination
manipulate
stock market consolidating a
political power base
but those be
more recent fantasy

and what if it be not fantasy
what
if you be out there in the world and
could do whatever you wanted with no
consequence whatsoever
how far would
go
i mean
if it be real

world
i mean there be a
responsibility

let we say you see a woman with amazing
tit

university they ask college student
would you steal if you be
guaranteed to get away with it
