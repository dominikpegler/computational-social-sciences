get rid of the pain
of be a man

dr
johnson

we be somewhere around barstow on
the edge of the desert when the
drug begin to take hold

i remember saying something like
i feel a bit lighthead
maybe
you should drive



suddenly there be a terrible roar
all around we and the sky be full
of what look like huge bat all
swoop and screech and diving
around the car

and a voice be screaming
holy
jesus
what be these goddamn
animal

what be you yell about

never mind
it be you turn to drive

no point mentioning these bat
i
thought
the poor bastard will see
they soon enough

we have two bag of grass seventy
five pellet of mescaline five
sheet of high power blotter
acid a salt shaker half full of
cocaine a whole galaxy of multi
colored upper downer screamer
laughers
also a quart of tequila
a quart of rum a case of beer a
pint of raw ether and two dozen
amyls


not that we needed all that for the
trip but once you get locked into
a serious drug collection the
tendency be to push it as far as
you can

the only thing that really worry
i be the ether
there be nothing
in the world more helpless and
irresponsible and deprave than a
man in the depth of an ether binge
and i know we would get into that
rotten stuff pretty soon

an overdose of heroin be listed as
the official because of death for
pretty year old diane hanby
whose body be find stuffed in a
refrigerator last week

one toke over the line sweet
jesus



one toke
you poor fool
wait
till you see those goddamn bat

let we give that boy a lift

we can not stop here this be bat
country

hot damn
i never ride in a
convertible before

be that right
well i guess
you be about ready eh

we be you friend
we be not like
the other

no more of that talk or i will put
the leech on you


how long could we maintain i
wonder
how long before one of
we start rave and jabber at
this boy
what will he think then
this same lonely desert be the
last known home of the manson family

would he make that grim connection
when i attorney start screaming
about bat and huge manta ray
coming down on the car

if so well we will just have to
cut he head off and bury he
somewhere
because it go without
saying that we can not turn he loose
he would report we at once to some kind
of outback nazi law enforcement
agency and they will run we down
like dog

jesus
do i say that

or just think it
be i talking
do they hear i

it be okay
he be admiring the shape
of you skull


maybe i well have a chat with
this boy i think
perhaps if i
explain thing he will rest easy

roar over the
road noise
there be




that be good
because i want you to
have all the background
this be a
very ominous assignment with
overtone of extreme personal
danger
i be a doctor of journalism
this be important goddamnit
this
be a true story
the

with he fist

keep you hand off i fuck neck

we vibration be get nasty
but why
be there no communication
in this car
have we deteriorate
to the level of dumb beast


i want you to understand that this
man at the wheel be i attorney
he be not just some dingbat i find
on the strip
he be a foreigner
i
think he be probably samoan
but it
do not matter do it
be you
prejudice

hell no

i do not think so
because in
spite of he race this man be
extremely valuable to i
hell i
forget all about this beer
you
want one
shake
he head
how about some ether

what

never mind
let we get right to the
heart of this thing
Twentyfour

trouble
you be going to need
plenty of legal advice before this
thing be over
as you attorney i
must advise you that you will need a
very fast car with no top and after
that the cocaine
and then the
tape recorder for special music

fool not to ride this strange
torpedo all the way to the end

of story be this

the mint
the rich offroad
race for motorcycle and dune
buggy in the history of organized
sport
hand park
ticket to valet
a fantastic spectacle in honor
of some fatback grossero who own
the luxurious mint hotel in the
heart of downtown vegas

sleep
you have to work
goddamn
what a bummer
try to rest
do not
let i keep you up


ignore the nightmare in the bathroom
just another ugly refugee from the
love generation

i attorney have never be able to
accept the notion often espouse
by former drug abuser that you
can get a lot high without drug
than with they
and neither have
i for that matter

i recall one night in the matrix
there i be a victim of the drug
explosion
natural street freak
just eating whatever come by

anybody want some


i
get all the makins right here
all i need be a place to cook


i decided to eat only half at first
good think
but i spilled the
rest on the sleeve of i red
pendleton shirt

what be the trouble

well all this white stuff on i
sleeve be

with a bit of luck he life be
ruined forever think that
just behind some narrow door in all
he favorite bar man in red
pendleton shirt be get
incredible kick from thing he will
never know


strange memory on this nervous
night in las vegas
he get up pour
himself a drink
have it be five year
six
it
seem like a lifetime the kind
of peak that never come again
san francisco in the middle sixties
be a very special time and place
to be a part of
but no
explanation no mix of word or
music or memory can touch that
sense of knowing that you be
there and alive in that corner of
time and the world
whatever it
mean









i





do not


prevail
we have all the momentum
we be riding the crest of a high
and beautiful wave

so now less than five year later
you can go up on a steep hill in
las vegas and look west and with
the right kind of eye you can
almost see the high water mark
that place where the wave finally
broke and rolled back


the decision to flee come suddenly
or maybe not

room service

maybe i would planned it all along
subconsciously waiting for the
right moment
the bill be a
factor i think
because i have no
money to pay for it

we room service tab have be
running somewhere between and
per hour for fortyeight
consecutive hour
incredible
how could it happen

but by the time i ask this
question there be no one around
to answer


i attorney be go
he must have
sense trouble


panic

it creep up i spine like first
rise vibe of an acid frenzy
all these horrible reality begin
to dawn on i

here i be alone in las vegas
with this goddamned incredibly
expensive car completely twisted
on drug no cash no story for the
magazine
and on top of everything
else i have a gigantic goddamn hotel
bill to deal with

i do not even know who have win the
race
maybe nobody


how would horatio alger have
handle this situation

stay calm
stay calm
i be a
relatively respectable citizen a
multiple felon perhaps but
certainly not dangerous

luckily i have taken the soap and
grapefruit and other luggage out to
the car a few hour early
now
it be only a matter of slipping
the noose




mr
duke
we have be looking for
you

the game be up
they have i

well why not
many fine book

do not worry i will get it to
he

what confused we be dr
Gonzos
signature on the telegram from los
angeles
when we know he be right
here in the hotel

to understand a press message
about half the time we use code
especially with dr
gonzo

tell i
when will the doctor be
awake

what do you mean

well
the manager mr
heem

nothing
unusual
mr
heem like to meet
all we large account
put they
on a personal basis
just a chat
and a handshake you understand

of course
but if i be you i would
leave the doctor alone until after
he be eat breakfast
he be a very
crude man

but he will be available
perhaps
later this morning

look
that telegram be all
scramble
it be actually from
thompson not to he
western
union must have get the name
reversed

hand

few people understand the psychology
of dealing with a highway traffic
cop
you normal speeder will
panic and immediately pull over to
the side
this be wrong

it arouse contempt in the cop heart


make the bastard chase you
he
will follow
but he will not know
what to make of you blinker signal
that say you be about to turn right

this be to let he know you be
looking for a proper place to pull
off and talk

it will take he a moment to
realize that he be about to make
degree turn at speed
but you
will be ready for it brace for
the gs and the fast heel toe work

just what the do you think
you be do

area up ahead

over and sleep a few hour

nap will not help
i have be awake

off to chuckle about it on the
west side of town waiting for i

great jesus it be he

they have nail i
i be trapped in
some stink desert crossroads
called baker
i do not have much
time

airport

district attorney conference

rent
a white cadillac convertible
the
whole thing be arranged
what the
hell be you do out there in the
middle of the fuck desert

sense of almost terminal relief


i have to get rid of the shark
too
many people might recognize it
especially the vegas police
luckily i credit card be still
technically valid

this be a superior machine ten
grand worth of gimmick and high
price special effect
the rear
window leap up with a touch like
frog in a dynamit pond
the
dashboard be full of esoteric
light and dial and meter that i
would never understand

if the pig be gathering in
vegas i feel the drug culture
should be represent as well
and there be a certain bend appeal
in the notion of running a savage
burn on one las vegas hotel and
then just wheel across town and
checking into another

i and a thousand rank cop from
all over america
why not
move
confidently into they midst

going over to the americana hotel
tonight to meet she backstage

i desperately needed peace rest
sanctuary
i have not count on
this
finding i attorney on acid
and locked into some kind of
preternatural courtship

well i guess they bring the car
round by now

you know those little blue barrel
i give she a cap before i realized
she be a religious freak
jesus
she be never even have a drink

well
it will probably work out
we can keep she load and peddle
she ass at the drug convention

listen she be running away from
home for something like the fifth
time in six month
it be terrible

she be perfect for this gig
these
cop will go fifty buck a head to
beat she into submission and then
gang fuck she
we can set she up
in one of these back street motel
hang picture of jesus all over the
room then turn these pig loose on
she
hell she be strong
she will
hold she own

jesus christ

we a grand a day


stop talking like that

i figure she can do about four at a
time
christ if we keep she full
of acid that be more like two grand
a day
maybe three


you filthy bastard
i should cave
you fuck head in

in a few hour she will probably be
sane enough to work herself into a
tower Jesusbased rage at the
hazy recollection of be seduce
by some kind of cruel samoan who
feed she liquor and drag she
to a vegas hotel room and savagely
penetrate every orifice in she
body with he throbbing
uncircumcised member


i feel sorry for the girl i
wanted to help she

you will go straight to the gas
chamber
and even if you manage to
beat that they will send you back to
nevada for rape and consensual
sodomy
she be get to go

shit it do not pay to try to help
somebody these day

the only alternative be to take
she out to the desert and feed she
remains to the lizard
but it
seem a bit heavy for the thing we
be trying to protect
i attorney

we have to cut she loose
she be
get two hundred dollar
and we
can always call the cop up there
in montana where she life and
turn she in

what
what kind of goddamn
monster be you


it just occur to i that she
have no witness
anything that
she say about we be completely
worthless

we

hotel americana
i need a
reservation
for i niece

she be an artist and might seem a
trifle highstrung

okay lucy it be time to go meet
barbra

i feel like a nazi but it have to
be do

lucy be a potentially fatal
millstone on both we neck
there
be absolutely no choice but to cut
she adrift and hope she memory be
fucked

well that be that
take off slowly
do not attract attention


i give the cabbie an extra ten
buck to make sure she get there
safe
also i told he i would be
there myself in an hour and if she
be not i would come back out here and
rip he lung out

that be good
you can not be subtle
in this town

gland

we should get some of
that
just eat a big handful and
see what happen

some of what

extract of pineal




sure
that be a good idea
one
whiff of that shit would turn you
into something out of a goddamn
medical encyclopedia

man you head would swell up like
a watermelon you would probably gain
about a hundred pound in two
hour

right

grow claw
bleed wart

yes

then you would notice about six
huge hairy tit swelling up on you
back

fantastic

you would go blind
you body would
turn to wax
they would have to put
you in a wheelbarrow and


man i will try about anything
but
i would never touch a pineal gland


what
happen
what about the gland

jesus that stuff get right on top
of you do not it

suppose to turn back there

we have abused every rule that vegas
live by burning the local
abuse the tourist terrifying
the help
the only chance now i
feel be the possibility that we would
go to such excess that nobody in
the position to bring the hammer
down on we could possibility
believe it


jesus christ

Goddamnit
we be lost
what be
we do out here on this
godforsaken road

probably good advice if you have
shit for brain

there he go one of god own
prototype a high power mutant
of some kind never even considered
for mass production
too weird to
live and too rare to die


we be all wired into a survival
trip now
no more of the speed
that fuel that s
that be
the fatal flaw in tim Learys trip
he crashed around america sell
consciousness expansion without
ever giving a thought to the grim
meathook reality that be lying
in wait for all the people who take
he seriously

all those pathetically eager acid
freak who think they could buy
peace and understand for three
buck a hit
but they loss and
failure be ours too
what leary
take down with he be the central
illusion of a whole lifestyle that
he helped create

a generation of permanent
cripple failed seeker who never
understood the essential oldmystic
fallacy of the acid culture
the
desperate assumption that somebody
or at least some force be
tending the light at the end of the
tunnel


there be only one road back to

interstate just a flatout
high speed burn through baker and
barstow and Berdoo then on to the
hollywood freeway straight into
frantic oblivion
safety obscurity
just another freak in the freak
kingdom

ahhh

anymore

catch off guard
muttering
oh i god

do not worry
and i be actually the district
attorney from Ignoto county
just another good american like
yourself






i heart be filled with joy
i
feel like a monster reincarnation
of horatio alger
a man on the
move
and just sick enough to be
totally confident
