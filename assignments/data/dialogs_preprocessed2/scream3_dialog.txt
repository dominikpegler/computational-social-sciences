thank you

sid this be detective kincaid

nice to finally meet you sidney

the killer called she

what
when

Whatd he say

oh you know the usual small talk
what be new how you be how do you want
to die


sidney do you have any idea how he could have
get you number

he could have monitor the call on a scanner
do you call she from the set

no

do you have she number stored in you memory
phone memory

oh
yeah i guess i do

have anyone else every used you phone

just jennifer
and you

hey i be the cop here
you be in i office riley

the killer leaf a newspaper clipping at each
murder sidney
recently he be also left a photo
of you mother

why do not you tell i
this be i mother dewey
why do not you say something

i be afraid they be bait something to
you know trick you out of hide

listen detective i want to see this studio
where all this shit going down

be you sure

absolutely

alright sid over there be the
production office
that be where sarah
darling be murdered last night

mm what a waste of silicone
what do i mother have to do with this
all dewey
we be a long way from Woodsboro

oh i god karen you scare the shit out of i
what be you do here

who be this

karen Colcheck
from Woodsboro

she be Randys only girlfriend


ever

that be i
first and last

it be be a while
you still work
at bradleys

nope
they opened up a hollywood video
down the street
it pay good
anyway i be here because i hear on the
news about the murder and well i find
this while rooting through Randys thing


tell you i would make a movie someday huh


oh god

well if you be watch this tape it mean
as i feared i do not survive these killing
here at windsor college
anyway the reason
i be here be to help you so that i death
will not be in vain
that i life work will
help save some other poor soul from get mutilate
if this killer do come back and he be for real
there be a few thing that you get to remember
be this simply another sequel
well if it be same
rule apply
but here the critical thing
if you
find yourself dealing with an unexpected backstory
and a preponderance of exposition then the sequel
rule do not apply
because you be not dealing
with a sequel you be dealing with the concluding
chapter of a trilogy

trilogy

that be right
it be a rarity in the horror field
but it do exist and it be a force to be reckon
with because true trilogies be all about going back
to the begin and discover something that be not
true from the get go
godfather jedi all revealed
something that we think be true that be not true
so
if it be a trilogy you be dealing with here be some
super trilogy rule
one you get a killer who be going to be
super human
stab he will not work shooting he
will not work basically in the third one you get to
cryogenically freeze he head decapitate he or blow he
up
number two
anyone including the main character can
die
this mean you sid
i be sorry it be the final
chapter
it can be fuckin reservoir dog by the
time this thing be through
number three
the past
will come back to bite you in the ass
whatever you
think you know about the past forget it
the past be
not at rest any sin you think be committed in
the past be about to break out and destroy you

never ever under any circumstance go running off
by yourself because if friday the th have taught we
anything it be that the next time we be going to see you
you be going to have a fence post jut out from you
back
so in closing let i say good luck god speed
and for some of you i will see you soon because the rule
say some of you be not going to make it
i do not not
if you be watch this tape

thanks karen
you be careful

do not worry sid
i get ticket to see
family feud
i do have a somewhat ulterior
motive for driving all the way down here

i have get an idea i will hook up with you guy
later

do you want we to come with you

i work well alone
why do not you do some snoop
around the set

i can see nothing changed

just what the hell do you people think
you be do barge in here like this
i have get important call to make
i run
this studio

answer the question
you know Sidneys mom

who

rina reynolds

do you know how many actor have work
for i
hundreds thousands

nobody said she be an actor

good twist

what be you point

no point i be just going to give detective kincaid a call

i remember she
she be a bit player in a couple
of i movie
nobody
so what do it matter

oh come on
you have make millions off the story
of she murder
you be obsess with and
you be obsess with she

settle down beavis
why do not you tell we the truth

what the hell be you guy get at
i make horror
film that be what i do
the studio come to i
with stab
they come to i check it out

but you know who she be

when we do the first stab i realized i would
known maureen prescott before i mean as rina
i could not tell anyone
can you imagine the press

and now
i mean murder on you set and
still you say nothing

get real that would make i a suspect

just because you know she

yeah

i do not think so
just what happen to
maureen when she be in hollywood

now you listen to i lois lane let it go
it be dead and bury
daddy take ol Yeller
out behind the barn and shoot he in the head a
long time ago

well how would you like he rotten carcass dig
up and drug all over national
why do not
you start talking

it be in the s everything be different
i be well known for i party rina know what they be
it be for girl like she to meet man man who could get
they part if they make the right impression
nothing
happen to she that she do not invite in one way or
another no matter what she said afterwards

be you saying she be

i be saying thing get out of hand
maybe they
do take advantage of she
maybe the sad truth
be this be not the city for innocence
no charge
be bring
and the bottom line be rina reynolds
would not play by the rule
you want to get ahead in
hollywood you get to play the game or go home
