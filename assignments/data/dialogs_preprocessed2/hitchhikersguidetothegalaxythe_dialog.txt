we hear what we will come to know as the


it be an important and popular fact that
thing be not always what they seem

the
dolphin stadium at sea world

for instance on the planet earth man have
always assumed that he be the most
intelligent species occupying the planet
instead of the third most intelligent
which be in fact entirely accurate
the dolphin perform
leap through hoop etc

the second most intelligent creature
be of course dolphin who curiously
enough have long known of the impending
destruction of the planet earth
they have
make many attempt to alert mankind to the
danger but most of they communication
be misinterpret as amuse attempt to
punch football or whistle for tidbit so
they eventually decided they would leave
earth by they own means
they leap madly desperately
high and high

the last ever dolphin message be
misinterpret as a surprisingly
sophisticated attempt to do a double
backward somersault through a hoop while
whistling the starspangled banner but
in fact the message be this
so long and thank for all the fish


dolphin leap over and interact with the open title
breathtaking somersault back flip choreograph to a
buzby Berkleystyle song called

we end with a wide shot of all the
dolphin jumping out of the top of frame but they never
come back down
to a starry night sky the
dolphin have vanished

as night turn to morning we hear then

as well as sea world orlando and san
diego reporting they dolphin have
mysteriously disappeared overnight

Galactica as the standard repository of
all knowledge and wisdom
for though it
have many omission and contain much
which be apocryphal or at least wildly
inaccurate it score over the old more
pedestrian work in two important respect

arthur furrow he brow and Zaphod and follow Trillian

two head
interesting choice

apparently you can not be president with a
whole brain

so you carve it up

yes i think
and i think i do it in
such a way that it would not be detect by
the government screen test or by
i
so what be so secret that i can not let
anybody know i know it not the galactic
government not even myself
and the
answer be
i do not know
obviously
but i put a
few thing together and that be when i
realized i have this
he point to the on he gold necklace


the
brownish liquid
flow into it a martini glass top with dryice fog

can you do it

the ultimate question of life the

yes
there be an

can i help you

do you have

an answer for you
yes
i have

there really be an answer

yes
there really be one

oh

can you tell we what it be

yes
though i do not think you be going to
like it

do not matter
we must know it

you be really not going to like it

yes

forty two
the surround crowd be stun

it would have
be simple of course to have known
what the actual question be

but it be the question
the ultimate

yes but what actually be it



everything
you know
just



that be not a question
only when you know
what the actual question will you know
what the answer mean

i can not
but there be one who can

be to come after i one that i will

ultimate question one of such infinite
complexity that life itself will form part
of it operational matrix
and you
yourselves shall take on new more primitive

why this ship

the infinite improbability drive be a new
method of crossing vast interstellar

about in hyperspace

conceivable universe almost simultaneously

Kwaltz and Questular appear on the monitor

well captain

many respectable physicist said they
be not going to stand for that sort of

why do he keep saying that

i do not know
i be not used to seeing he
this way

i have be trying to tell you

hey look what i find in the guide
he hand the guide to Trillian
she keep walking

i would not tell she if i be you

she deserve to know

but if you tell she and she end up with
you because you be literally the last guy
on earth you will always doubt she
intention
arthur consider this

get you towel

do i need it

only always
ford put he towel to he mouth as they follow Trillian
down the mist covered street
she be reading the guide

in the begin the universe be created
this make a lot of people very angry and
have be widely regarded as a bad move

many race believe that it be created by
some sort of god though the Jatravartid

through the mind of the bowl of petunia
as it fell be oh no not again

he
collapse and bury he head in he hand




ford stand outside a stone doorway at the end of a

get to sound good

an ultimate question that sound good
from a couple of mouse
for a chat show

and as it turn out the chance be
astronomically high that the structure of
the question be encoded in you brain
which be why we need it

little woozy
do he hear they right

i be sorry do you just say you need i
brain

yes
to extract the question

you can not have i brain
i be use it

barely

we can replace it if you think it be

an electronic brain maybe

simple one should suffice
who would
know the difference

i would

no you would not
we could program you not
to
