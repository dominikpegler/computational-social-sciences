you be only as good as you mark
the
ropers the guy who find they



they all have money one way or
another
some of they come from money



there be that saying show i an honest
man and i will show you a natural born
liar
there be always that little bit
of bad no matter how much good
it be
that little itch on the back of you
neck
you may not even know it be there
but it be




good roper know how to scratch it

who be going to help
that be when you
meet the Insideman




the Insidemans the one with the know
how the scoop the angle
but maybe
you re the suspicious type
so i
give you the Convincer
we both put
up a little and we get a little back
just a taste



just enough that when i tell you we can
make more off of it you agree



that when i put you on the send

bookie club insurance scam
whatever
you see the money and you
want it
more of it
who care if you
have to bend the rule a little
as
long as no one get hurt

then someone do



frankie suit always said that what
you have to understand about any
confidence game be that it be like
putting on a play where everyone know
they part
the roper the
Insideman the shills
everyone
except for the mark

i have be shoot

motivation with this
why be i washing
glass

now you be an accomplice in a
homicide
everything you think you
be in control of just fly out the
window or be dripping down you leg

you should be running out the door
desperate to forget this ever
happen ready to repent you greedy
way


what about

the new york police department fine
half as smart and twice as crook as
the guy they just chase away


so how do you get catch


suit used to say that in any con
sooner or later someone going to
start asking the right question
usually it take a little long


we be working for the king

re
lupus

i be the kings eye and ear
just in
case you decide to get cute

so we get to short con we way out of a

i just have a good feel about you
have not you ever have someone say they
have a good feel about you before

no
what be i cut

what do i have to do

just play a part
little act

make a wish

Eleveneleven
if you be superstitious
make a wish


that be twice


i can see why you liked she

that be it
we have we crew
now we
needed the mark


morgan gillette

why

because that be who the king fin want
we to fleece
and Gillettes perfect




he grandfather used to run liquor
during prohibition and he father make
a bundle in illegal import and
export
that make he a third
generation crook


he be be tied into pretty much
everything
drug mob money
rinse




there be a story going around that he
helped fund the contra back in the
eighties


most of he money clean
lot of it
be not
the good part be that we know
exactly where it be


how much we going after

two million


we only owe the king a hundred and fifty

we get fifty percent
and we get clear
of the king

that be worth it right there
you ask
i i do not think you can do it

i be with jack LaLane
that guy
untouchable

that be why we do not go after he
directly




we find a doable guy in Gillettes
bank
someone about midlevel
not
too high not too low



we meet he with corporate paper
inquiring about a corporate loan for
start up capital
the corporate paper
be in order but we need thing to
happen fast
we guy fudges number in
the right place move we paper to
the top of the pile or to the bottom
depending upon what we need



how be that
he work for gillette



we pay good





we guy get we approved for the start
up capital
but the money can not be
transferred to any one person
on the
give day the money wired into a
corporate account in an offshore
bank




that same day i show up in the Caymens
with the proper i

and corporate paper
to make a withdrawal



uh



what



i be just think out loud here but
two million in a briefcase



good point



it be bank policy not to release this
money in cash because it be under a
corporate account






so we cash the check at another bank
jake slide the suitcase and the check
over to the teller




now this be the most important part
you can not just walk into the united
state with a suitcase full of cash

i

start up capital for a small tech
company
we tried the venture
capitalist route in the valley but
then again who have not up there

that be right
so brainiacs that we
be we think we would be innovative and
relocate east
try we luck with a
straight corporate loan out here

i can

on i
for the seat
cheers

so we have be meeting with bank all
day
it be amazing how many way they
can say no without ever use the
word


well typically corporate loan be
relatively simple matter but you do
need to demonstrate a capacity for gross
fund recovery

do not tell i you start a tech firm
here before we

no no
nothing like that
i work in
a bank

really
wish we have meet eight hour
ago

ask you if you would like to join we
ashby

now we have to lean


so then miles walk straight into the
creative director office and say
the code fine the program for
shit and throw down like a thousand
page of code on the guy desk

so this be we boss right
he chase
i and miles out of he office and
he be yell and screaming you be
fired
you whole team fired
he
start looking for lily lupus gordo

but the good part be that he could not
find gordo
he be in the bathroom
so he finally go in there kick in a
stall door and start yell
and
there be gordo pants at the ankle
holding a world magazine

i have not be able to use a public
bathroom since

especially with the thing

uh right

that be
when we decided to start we own
business

corporate bank give out
title like calendar
it be a small
lie but now we be sure he be playing

maybe you can help we understand what be
so hard about get a corporate loan

well typically speaking they be not
as long as you can demonstrate


capacity for gross fund recovery
yeah we get that part

that be right
and tech firm
they
tend to scare people off

they scare people off because most
people lack vision
vision and ball
present company excluded of course

get they money back

we know exactly how we be going to make
the money back

around raise some capital then sell
it off to a big company
microsoft
intel oracle whatever
the beauty of
it be they have pretty much sell the
company before they be even real
the
big company be already set to buy
it all they want to do be make sure
that the idea actually work
so they
get some start up capital make it work
then sell it for like five time the
initial loan

sort of like a letter of intent

exactly
but the catch be that you
can not tell anyone about the offer
because if it be public you could start
a bid war and that be considered a
breach of etiquette
it could kill a
deal
but wait too long and you be
not considered hot anymore

and you have this letter of intent

yes
that be why i wish there be guy
will to take a chance and live a
little

we be get down to the wire
apparently another company have a
similar product in right now
if
they beat we to it

off the record i be this close to
cutting someone in on the action if
it would help

should we get another round



poor bastard never know what hit he
jesus i almost feel sorry for the guy

i get to work off some of this
adrenaline
i get a line on this pawn
shop guy over in brooklyn
anybody

way to brooklyn for a hundred dollar
payoff

you sure

lupus

when this be all over you be going to
tell i who the king put on al

you going to have the time

i find the time

look at you
you want to go

for what
couple hundred buck


i think you would do it for free
you re
almost drool
you like the rush

it be what i do
it be i job

why
you mother not breast feed you
or something

be you asking i if i have something
to prove

do you have something to prove

not in that repress anger sort of
way

i be you basic underachiever
can not
stand working and porn do not seem
like a good option

good quality porn have it be place in the
world

whatever
but you

you could have bullshitted you way
into anything
so why this

i be good at it

it be more than that

intuition

smile and shake
i ass

no

know what to do


how do you know i will

intuition


you have really soft hand
like a
baby

do not ruin this for i


be that what it be jake
be it
love

you know when the first con be ever
play
it be when adam fell for eve
in the garden of eden

then she fuck he over with an apple
redhead



drowned out by the
rumble
how do you deal with




deal with that

do you think we can do it

maybe
even if we do not you will be
alright
you be not in the hole with
the king

who say you have to know the king to
be in a whole
i actually do have a
real job once
when i be in high
school i worked as a candy striper

guy

we be do
with a shift one night both a couple
of Percocets down and i be telling

first because i loved he
what the hell be he name

glenn talk you out of it

sort of
i be telling he about this
great love of i life who be name i do not
remember and i could see
he be
get piss
i think it be just
because he be worry about i but


he told i that i be stupid because
i boyfriend do not really love i

he be looking out for you

then he grab i and threw i down
on the floor that really cold
linoleum tile hospital floor and
start ripping i uniform off
he said he be going to fuck some
sense into i


shit what be that guy name

after glenn be finished he give i a
couple of valiums and i go home

chest
three or four time

this be probably about where you come
in

wow
now that be an exciting story
butch have anyone ever tried something
like this before

not that i recall
what do you want we
to do about it

let we see
let we suppose he get to
custom and he get catch
we get we
money back but then we have to deal
with a criminal investigation
i do not
much like that idea
then again let we
suppose he actually get through
custom
now that be something
we recover the money in cash and let
the insurance cover the corporate fraud
we double we money


so we go to the bar

i think so
the airport going to be
crawling with police
traffic will be
a nightmare
go down to the bar
if
they pull it off great
have someone
deal with ashby

we will take care of it

and how much do you say you wanted for
this
what do you call it
finder
fee

ten percent

ten
that seem a little high

ten be standard sir

but only if we recover the cash

only if
no way

for this

wha




trust





it should be a four letter word


jesus christ
tell i before you do
something like that

you should leave



so i be dead



but maybe i can not blame lily
maybe i
just should have just trusted she to
play she part
because playing the big
con be like putting on a play
play
where everyone know they part except
for the mark



just watch everything you say around
he
every word every move
it all
go back to the king pin
get it


you have no idea what you have do do
you
no idea
what be this




you tell they the tale

what do you want
an apology

no i want i cut




and like in a game of chess you have
play every possible move in you
head

you be right
he be trying to fuck
you
you want it you get to get it at
the airport





then you give they the Blowoff
you
get they off you back
forever

we be on the job
we be active in the
onesix

officer Rottovich and Sobozinski

fuck i




but most of all you need the fix


that be how special agent gunther Moonan
and i become friend





like suit said sooner or later
someone going to start asking the
right question



Rottovich and Sobozinski would ask how
the drug get in that suitcase
the
king and gillette would ask where the
money really go



and all of they would ask what agency
special agent gunther Moonan worked
for




but what do i care
