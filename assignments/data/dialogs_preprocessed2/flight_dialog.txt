and a double shot of Stoli

wow
that audio paint a strong
picture
captain whitaker be
surely a hero in i opinion

absolutely
however every
incident be different
the action
of the pilot on SouthJet will
be heavily scrutinize
it be
protocol for any investigation


kevin it be still chaotic here at
the site
apparently a small
ministry be conducting service
near to where the plane come down
so the scene here be a mix of
survivor and first responder i
be able to catch up with an actual
passenger moment ago

we be in a nose dive and people
be screaming and yell and then
the plane turned upside down and we
have to hold on to we seat belt to
keep from falling out of we chair
i see one kid fall to the floor
and this flight attendant picked
he up and hand he to his
dad
i do not see she again

more detail and more report of
the casualty be continuing to
fly around
i can tell you that
there appear to be many many
survivor
that be all i have for
now
kevin

rebecca surviving passenger be
be put in ambulance police
cruiser and even first responder
vehicle and they be be taken
to local hospital for treatment
some of the injure appear serious
and it be safe to assume at this
point that there be at least a few
fatality
let we roll the tape of
the passenger i caught up with
early


we turned like a corkscrew and all
i could think be this be really
happening i be going to die and
then all of a sudden the plane be
upside down but steady and the
pilot must have known how to fly it
that way
he flip it back over
and landed it hard

obviously a harrow ordeal for
those on the trouble plane
this
be callie kenner for news

folk in the house that border
this field come running from they
house

i think it be thunder at first
but it shake the ground hard
thunder do not do like that
i run
outside and i could hear people
yell and i could see a small
fire at first
i just take the
dog and headed down there
then i
see the plane crumple on the
ground
i never see nothing like
that in i life

just like that plane this
community be shattered
folk here
remain on edge as media truck
continue to line they small road
and crowd the field where the plane
still lie
back to you tom


we be going to take another look at
the cell phone footage that
capture the last moment of
SouthJets flight

after the level off and smack down in the field we
return to in the crash field

many hour have passed since the
footage you just watch but the
crash site remains active as
investigator work through the
night
use flood light and
miner cap team continue to
comb the crash field looking for
the answer to the hard question
as to what bring down SouthJets
flight
those answer remain
in darkness as do the break piece
of the aircraft
hopefully
sunlight will bring answer
for
now this be kent johnson report

rain pound the windshield as we watch
he expertly add vodka to a halffull bottle of orange juice
give the bottle a shake before taking a long drink
take another drink before recap the bottle and
stow it in the glove box
get out and we watch he
walk in the rain towards the door of the hangar

meet he and take he inside


be now alone in the huge brightly light hangar
he see
the plane
the have all of it piece laying as close together as
possible
like the skeleton of a TRex in a museum
the
sight be awesome breathtaking
walk closer to the
twist wreck and stop
be overwhelmed by the sight
and as he be about to leave
step out of the passenger door and call down to


here we guy
mon
walk towards a ramp that lead up to the hole in the
plane where the door used to be
stand at the top
of the ramp
suddenly step out of the plane

captain whitaker we have win
do not move as start down the ramp

this be what we call in i
profession a walk over


they have scheduled the hear
it be
in day
and reach the bottom of the ramp


but these hearing can be tough
you just need to stay sharp and on
course and answer the question
correctly
it be no long a
question of you condition but the
condition of the plane

i have have an act of god
successfully added to the list of
probable cause

look it be simple
i fly a break
plane

you get it
that be right

and what about i toxicology
report

i killed it
they have no physical
proof that you be intoxicated on
that plane
and no eye witness
claim
but there be a problem

because of the turbulence at the
begin of the flight and then
the crash there be never any
drink service on the flight
but
they find two little vodka bottle
in the galley trash bin
there be
no physical evidence find on the
bottle no no finger print
but both the bottle be uncapped
and empty
the only people who have
access to those bottle and could
have drink they be the flight
crew
margaret evans and camelia
Satou all have clean tox report
that leaf you and trina marquez

where this be going
that be funny that they find two
bottle

why

because i drink three
one
miss

when i meet you i could not believe
what a flip drunk arrogant
scumbag you be

fuck you too hugh

the analysis from the expert

do you know how many be able to
safely land these break plane

not one
every pilot crashed and
killed everyone on board

you have no capacity to accept the
responsibility for the miracle you
perform and the live you saved

they ask about you drink it be
totally acceptable to say i do not
recall


do not tell i how to lie about i
drink
i have be lying about i
drink i whole life

those be difficult image to
watch
for the record i be ellen
block hear officer for this
hear
captain whitaker good
morning


morning

what be capture on that video be
that the aircraft be in a
relatively stable glide just prior
to the moment of impact
however accord to the data we
retrieve from the cockpit data
recorder at exactly
after
fly minute without incident
the transponder recorded a loss in
altitude in excess of foot per
minute in what be considered a
full pitch nose down attitude
then at
accord to the data
recorder a decision be make to
invert the aircraft
the have
created animate simulation that i
would like to play at this point

that audio be tragic and
compel
i choose to play that
part of the cockpit recording to
highlight a key moment aboard
flight wherein you say we be
going to roll it here we go i have get
control
you make a very
conscious decision to invert the
airplane to roll the plane upside
down
be that correct


i be not sure it be conscious
it
be more of an instinct

what lead to that decision

i do not recall

let i quote from an investigative
summary
from
until
the
event on the aircraft be
again
i quote bold and remarkable
by invert the plane captain
whitaker arrest the descent and
allow the aircraft to level off
enabling he to glide the aircraft
away from any populated area and
allow he to execute a force
landing in an open field

i hear a metallic bang
we
pitch nose down
no control

you have no idea what be wrong with
the aircraft

there be a lot of thing wrong
with that aircraft

as i said before you can add any
detail you like to any comment i
make
do you remember any thing
else that be out of the ordinary
do you feel the flight crew be in
they good shape


yes

it be rain very hard the
morning you take off be not it

there be some convective activity
in the area
however i first
officer and i discuss the
condition on the field and
determined that we be safely
within we visibility and crosswind
minimum

yes first officer evans testimony
confirm the same

i want to show you something

nothing happening

this remote be not work
apology
i can do it manually

this be the jackscrew on the tail
assembly which articulate the
horizontal stabilizeralso known
as the elevator
as you can see
the thread on this screw be
almost entirely go


substandard thread life be how we
reported it
this part be
suggested as a maintenance
replacement in january of
it
be never replace
this have additional hour of
flight on it
it finally failed

we investigator have conclude
that the jackscrew snap and the
elevator be frozen in a fix
position locking the elevator in a
down position which forced the
plane into a dive
the loss of the
elevator be and i quote we
report a catastrophic event from
which recovery be improbable and
stable flight impossible


again i quote
from
until

the pilote decision make by
captain whitaker be bold and
remarkable
the fact that captain
whitaker command that the
aircraft stay invert while
descending to an extremely low
altitude show a miraculous
intuition that in this instance
save live


i appreciate that


mr
whitaker i want to talk about
the day leading and hour lead
up to the accident
but before i
do i want to remind you that you
