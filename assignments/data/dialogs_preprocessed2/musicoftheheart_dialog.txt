word of advice
when you be picking
up you student go to alices
classroom first

so pretend you be driving a car and
i be the policeman and i say
thumb up finger straight up flat
palm
now you be policeman but turn
you hand and make it say stop to
yourself

you be under arrest

knock it off de sean
if you kid can not take this seriously
i do not want you here
i be teaching
you a difficult instrument because i
respect you and have faith that you
can learn it
but none of that matter
if you do not have respect for
yourself

now turn you wrist so it be flat
against the fingerboard and that be
how you will set up you hand

violin

we hear you get fired

what

be it true

why do not you come in i office

it be true
you be firing i

it be not i roberta
the board of
ed
cut the budget the district have
to comply and as of the end of this
term the violin program have be
excessed

Excessed
they specifically said that i violin
program have to go

they have slashed the budget music
and art program get hit the bad

what about dennis class

i be tenured roberta

when be this decided

thing happen very quickly
i
wanted to tell you myself

i just
i can not even believe this
be happening

why not
you be a sub
you position
have never be permanent

shut up dennis
you be not helping
come into i office please

there be get to be a way to fight this

fight it with what
i do not have any
other extra program to give they
instead

oh i see
so after ten year after
fourteen hundred child have learned
to play the violin this be just an
extra program


you know i do not feel that way and
you know damn well i have be standing
by you all these year
you think i
have not notice what you have do for
these kid

then do something

i have be on this phone for the past
three day trying to do something
the district office can not even stand
the sound of i voice
believe i
there be some people around here
i would much rather get rid of
but as
far as the board concern violin
class be not a priority

i do not have the power here roberta
i be so sorry

sitting at the kitchen table with a
glass of wine she face ashen

what happen

i be a good teacher
i have work so
hard to give these kid something to
be proud of

i be so sorry mom
i can not believe
they do this to you

it be like when i father get killed
for twenty year he follow every
safety rule the factory have and
then someone else flip the wrong
switch
it be not fair
you do everything
right and then

it be the wrong analogy
you could not
do anything about Grandpas death
it be irreversible
this be not

tell that to the board of education

let i ask you something
why do
you risk you life for a bicycle

i do not risk i life

of course you do
that build
threaten henry
and for what
two hundred dollar

no
not for that

then why

when someone steal something that
belong to i kid i be not going to
sit back and let that happen

guy you need to think about this
if i try to fight this with no
salary coming in i could lose the
house screw up you college plan
it would be a lot safe to just go
out tomorrow and get a job in a
private school

yeah but be that where you really
want to be

the beautiful concert that you just
hear could be the last concert of
the east harlem violin program
the
board of education and the district
superintendent do not think that music
be important for we child
but
they be wrong and they be in for
a fight

Someones early

hello assunta
how be you

i would be a lot good if i daughter
have a job next year

ma

i would too

sorry i be early but i figure we would
need time to set up

mama why do not you take allegra out
for a walk

you be have a meet here tonight
right
parent and teacher

well yes but

take it from i
if you want to get
parent to help you with something
you have to feed they

you have a cut board for these

as she continue to
unpack
and if you think parent be bad
teacher be even bad no offense
if you do not feed they you never
get anything extra out of they
that be
why i get this

Entenmanns get they every time

what
do not tell i you expect i
to bring something homemade

as she take the
cake from she
well no
i

good
because take it from i i
own family beg i to stay out of
the kitchen

what i do not expect be for you to
be here

why not
we have get to figure out a
way to fight this
as she arrange
cracker on a plate
after ten year roberta i can not
imagine walking through those hallway
and not hearing that offkey
screechy scratchy nailsonthe
blackboard violin music

what do you think
cut it into slice
now or leave it whole

let we cut it now
it will be less messy

do not they realize how much this
program help the kid


simons we third child to study
with roberta
james be premed
Aprils valedictorian now that
say something


i think we should inundate the board
and the district with letter

you be wasting you time
the board
and the district be not going to pay
for this program no matter how many
letter they get

what if we raise the money ourselves

i can not see how they would object to
that

well once that newspaper article
come out that should help bring in
money

yeah but what if it do not
for
all we know it be going to be buried on
the back page
besides who say
anyone going to give a damn about we
kid

what if you do a benefit concert
we
can raise a batch of money from ticket
sales and then the concert itself
could be great publicity
there be
word of mouth
you could get
review

it well be a good concert

we have to offer something more than
i and the kid
do you think maybe you husband would
perform with we

i be sure i could persuade he with a
little pillow talk
and maybe he can
get another violinist too itzhak
perlman perhaps

that would be fantastic

we could rent a place like the nd
street it be perfect for this
it seat about nine hundred people
and if we charge between fifty and a
hundred a ticket

we could probably raise enough to
reinstate you program for a year

sound like a plan

it well be a good concert

take you pick

kid listen to i it be really
important that you do not look at the
camera and you try to act as natural
as possible

who authorized this

janet

well janets not here today and i
want these people out of here

turn that off you hear i

why be you do this
we be not
bother anyone

you be disrupt school and i want
they out of here now

you still do not get it do you
i
do not care if you hate i dennis
that be you business
but think about
the student for once
every time
you interfere you be not hurting i
you be hurting they

get these people out of here or i be
calling the police

go right ahead call they
Thatll
look real good on the eleven of the clock
news

i do not hear no siren

i be from a blue collar family and
if it be not for the lesson i get
in public school i never would have
learned the violin



how do it make you feel to lose
you violin program

it make we sad

yeah like we be never going to have no
more violin lesson

and it be bad because
because we
love violin class

yes i have get offer from two
private school but this be where i
want to be



arnold these kid need help

do not we send they a donation

they need something big
and you
can not just write a check you have
to get involve

involve how

Uhoh

listen up everyone
quiet down

you be i very good beginner and
advance violin student and i have
chosen you to play in Fiddlefest
because i trust that you can handle
the pressure
it be going to be a lot of
work a lot
right now we have sell
some ticket but i be not going to be
back here in the fall if the audience
storm out of they seat demanding
a refund

Rachels going to be i lieutenant and
i expect you to listen to she

Bachs minuet one

people be going to be paying good money
for this concert we be not just
going to play twinkle

i be passing out a contract that you
and you parent need to sign

every saturday and sunday

plus night time rehearsal during
the week

how can we practice
we be rehearse

you think this be funny stephanie
you think the four hundred people
who have buy ticket so far will

you think itzhak
perlman will think it be funny that
he be donate he time and you be
all going to stink

be i boring you vanessa

it be
in the morning
i be
just tire

there be no time to be tire
to all get she
violin in position
let we try it again

i must have be crazy to agree to
this
they be never going to be ready
and you should hear the bach double
disaster
so the good news be
ticket be selling like hot cake
but the bad news be that the kid
sound like shit

there be more bad news
we have lost
the

what

they have a flood a water heater
burst
the concert hall be damaged
and they have cancel all event

until when

until far notice


this can not happen
we have sell ticket
we have do publicity
the concerto
in three week

i have be on the phone all morning
calling other theaters
nothing
available

just keep looking

stop
Someones playing the wrong
note
and you should not need you
music anymore
except for the bach
double everything have to be memorize
by next rehearsal

and you sound like you be
sleepwalking
you heart not even
in it

maybe because we do not have a place
for the concert

well you be right
this might all
be for nothing
so we can either
keep on rehearse in case we find a
place or we can just
give up

be i hearing right
do you use the
word give up
let we take a vote
how many of you
want to give up

see
you taught we well

what about in the bronx

there be nothing
why do not you just do it in one of
the school
it will be a lot small
but

we will not make enough money

what about postpon it

itzhak and arnold be booked all
summer



it be dorothea

i have good news really good news
arnold get a call from he friend
wally Scheur who hear about we losing
the and wanted to see how he could
help and then wally have this
brilliant idea and called he friend
isaac stern and it be all arranged
we have a new place for Fiddlefest

where

carnegie hall

carnegie hall



incredible sound in this room no

oh i god isaac stern

you must be roberta

thank you so much for helping we

looking out at the
hall
would you believe in they tried
to tear this place down
they wanted
to replace it with a bright red
skyscraper we called it the red
terror


you be kidding

we have to fight like hell but with
a lot of help we saved carnegie
hall

if it be all right with you i would like
to play in you concert
maybe bring
a couple of friend

great violinist

and the world great violinist
be playing side by side with you
because they want to help you win
this fight

yes but
you do not understand
maybe there be a good reason why i
never make it as a violinist maybe
i just can not cut it
i keep blame
it on not have enough early
train but if i be talented if
i have a gift

but you do have a gift
you be going to
put thirty east harlem kid on stage
at carnegie hall not because they be
prodigy but because you get they
to stick with something that be hard
as hell and to strive for excellence
which by the way i certainly be not
striving for when i be they age
not to mention the other ten year
worth of student whose live be
changed because of you

talent roberta

attention to you play anyway
