and every situation a chick could create
but that be just not the case
they be universal
they be sheep
they be to be studied and
watch they have pattern that must be stopped
interupted and resist
i would be makin a fuckin
butt load if they be actually as much of
a challenge as they want you to think they be
reality
they be all the same
each and every one of they
and once you learn
these method

the girl get the dial tone
she look completely confuse and hurt

frank speaking to the group

let she wonder what she do wrong

franks tone change a bit get dark

this be the way
because they will
always wonder what do i do

what could i have do different

how should i behave to get this back

and if they think that way then they
be asking for you to hurt they and
that be what you must do
that be what
you must do which be punish they many
many time over

push in as walk towards we down the same
hallway we see jimmy gator walking down early she head
into an office

push in on linda as she enter over to a
who look up

mrs
partridge

i be here and i need to see he

quick shot get they in the room

sit
across from who be in semihysterics pace

he be fucking die he be die
as we be sitting here and there
be not a fuck thing jesus
how can you tell i to calm down


i can help you through this the
best i know how but there be certain
thing you be going to have to be
strong about and take care of now
we can go over they but i need to
know that you be listening to i ok

i just i just i just i be just
in a fuck state i know he be
going and it be like i do not know how
just tell i
thing
what the fuck do i do with he body
what happen when he die
that next moment
what
what do i do
then what


well that be what hospice will take care of
for you
they will send a nurse someone
who can take care of all of that for you

he have phil right now


phils one of the nurse from the service

yeah


if you be happy with phil taking care
of he and helping you that be fine
but contact hospice to arrange for the body

you do not understand
it be more pain
than before and the fuck morphine pill
be not working he be past two day it be
like he can not really swallow they and i do not
know if they be going down i can not see inside
he mouth anymore i be up all night stare
at he and i do not think the pill be going
down and he moan and he hurt


we can fix that because i can give
you be you listening

i be listening
i be get good


do you want to sit down

i need to sit down


ok
linda
earl be not going to make it
he be die
he be
he be dying very
very rapidly
she break a bit more


now the thing here be making that experience
as painless and easy as possible for he
you understand
now you need to get in touch
with hospice care because they can take care of
all those practical thing that you be asking
i about they be who you call when he die
he write a number on he bussiness card hand it over as they speak


this be the number for hospice
ok
now
as far as the morphine pill go
there be something else to consider that
can take the pain away that he be in
there be a very strong and very potent solution
of liquid morphine
it be a little bottle
with an eye dropper and it be easy to get in
he mouth and drop on he tounge and
it will certainly diminish the pain that
he be in but you have to realize that
once you give it to he
there really
be no coming back i mean it will certainly
cure he pain but he will float in and
out of consciousness even bad than he
be now linda
i mean any sign of the
recognizable earl will pretty much go away

how the fuck can i say anything
to that i do not know what to say to that

as possible right now we job be to just
try and make it as painless as possible

like maybe this be the scene of the
movie where the guy be trying to get
ahold of the longlost son but this

know
i think they
have those scene in movie because they be
true because they really happen

this be really
happening
i mean i can give you i
phone number and you can call i back
if you want to check with whoever you can check

please please

see
see this be the scene of the movie where
you help i out

frank and Gwenovier do the interview

see i think you grow up here
in the valley

like i said yeah

and you go to van Nuys high right

i do not how much i go but i be
enrol
i be such a loser back then
i be misguide pathetic i be very fat
not even close to what i be today
not the frank mackey you be eager to talk
to because i be swimming in what
as
opposed to i

where do that name come from

what name
i name

it be not you give name right

i mother name actually
good question
you have do you be research

and frank


frank be i mother father

ok
that be why
i have trouble locate
you school record at Berkely and
you name change they have no official
enrollment

oh yeah
no no no
they would not

they would not

no no no
certainly not
i be not
officialy enrol that be right
be that unclear

kind of

i would not want that to be misunderstood
i enrollment be totally unoffical because
i be sadly unable to afford tuition up
there
but there be three wonderful man
who be kind enough to let i sit in on
they class and they be name be
macready horn and langtree among other
i be completely independent financially
and like i said
one sad sack shit
so what we be looking at here be a true
rag to riches story and i think that be
what most people respond to in seduce
and at the end of the day
hey it may not
even be about picking up chick and sticking you
cock in it it be about finding what you can be
in this world
defining it
controle it and
saying
i will take what be mine
you just happen
to get a blow job out of it then heywhatthefuck
whynot
