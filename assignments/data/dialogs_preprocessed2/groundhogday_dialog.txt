i d rather followup on the
nurse strike


you can do the nurse when you
get back
just take the squeaky
wheel here up to Punxsutawney and
get he back in one piece
okay

yeah okay

you know this could be extremely
interesting

i have never do a weather story
before
what be Punxsutawney
like

oh it be an enchant place

magical world
it be the
constantinople of the whole
western AppalachianSusquehanna
drainage system

do you always joke

about to of the time
inside i be actually a very shy
and sensitive person

lot of people around here think
you be not very sincere

tell i the name of these
people

i will line up a crew and
transportation
if you do not
feel like driving we can all go
up in the van together

i think i will take i own car
i m not that fond of i fellow
man


nice attitude

nice face
why do not you ride up with i

no thank

they do not really think of i as
a weatherman around here
more
of a personality but with the
credibility of a firstclass
broadcast journalist
once you
look at i tape i think you will
see what they mean

i just want to know one thing
do i do something wrong or be
you just tire of i or what
i
have to know

dan can i call you back
i have
just be hand something and i
well get on it
he pick up some
paper and rustle
they for effect
okay thank


you do not do anything wrong
stephanie and i m not tire of
you
it be just that i do not have
time for a real relationship
right now
i told you that the
first time we go out

everybody say that at the
begin of a relationship

gently pushing she

i be different
i really mean
it
thing be really starting
to move for i now
i m not
going to be do the weather for
the rest of i life
i be just
talking to the guy about a
network job
i want that
this
be just the begin for i
i
can not waste any more time

be you saying we relationship
be a waste of time

we relationship
we go out a
total of four time
and only
twice do anything happen
it
be fun but i do not see that as
a big commitment

i have we chart do
i
astrologer say we be extremely
compatible
there may even be
some past life involvement here

see
so we have already do this
let we move on
next case

you know what be wrong with you
phil
you be selfish
you do not
have time for anyone but
yourself


that be what i m trying to tell
you
you do not want to be with
i
you can do well
look
stephanie if i ever said or do
anything to mislead you i be sorry
for that but right now i have to
do this groundhog thing and i
do not have a handle on it yet


i will tell you what
i m going to
do some serious think while
i m in Punxsutawney okay




i be on i way to Punxsutawney
forced to repeat it
a little embarrass
Punxsutawney

meet i up there tonight and let
i vulgarize you for about seven
hour

the night in Punxsutawney all
alo ne

to i mr
connors
have you
considered psychiatric help



that be kind of an unusual
problem mr
connors
most of i
work be with couple and
family

yeah but you be still a
psychologist
you must have have
some course in school that
covered this kind of thing

sort of i guess
abnormal
psychology

so base on that what would you
say

i d say that maybe you be i
do not know a little delusional

you be saying this thing be not
really happening to i

Uhhuh

then how do i know this
conversation be really happening

i guess you do not

then forget about i paying you

not necessarily
if it concern
you we should schedule we next
session as soon as possible
how be tomorrow for you


now if the moon exert a
gravitational pull strong enough
to because the tide
then it may
be theoretically possible for a
black hole or a singularity of
sufficient magnitude to actually
bend time enough to because it to
fold back on itself

you think that be a realistic
possibility

just need a little visit to the
assistant principal office

when the princess kiss the
frog

when she kiss the frog

the princess kiss the frog and
the spell get break and he turned
into a handsome prince and they
get marry and live happily
ever after
