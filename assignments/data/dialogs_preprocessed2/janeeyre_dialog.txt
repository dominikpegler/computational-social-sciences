let we try it on shall we

and that be how she charm i
english gold out of i english
breech pocket

you gaze be very direct miss
eyre
you think i handsome

no sir

i be too plain
i beg you pardon

what fault do you find with i
i
have all i limb and all i


mr rochester it be a blunder
i ought to have reply that
beauty be of little consequence

now you stick a knife under i


you have other quality sir

just so
other quality
when
i be you age i be a fell
enough fellow
i might have be
insulted then
you be blush
miss eyre

not at all

and though you be not pretty any
more than i be handsome i must
say it become you
and now i see you be fascinated
by the flower on the rug

i would like to draw you out
come
speak to i

what about sir

the choice of subject be entirely
yours

how can i introduce a subject
when i do not know what will
interest you

the fact be miss eyre i do not
wish to treat you like an
inferior

yet you would command i to speak

well i probably have a right to
be a little abrupt and exact
on the ground of i superiority
in age
there must be twenty
year between we and a century
advance in experience

i do not think you have a right to
command i just because you be
old
you claim to superiority
depend on the use you have make of
you time and experience

i have make indifferent use of
both
and this be why i sit
gall by i own thought and
order you to divert i
be you
very hurt by i tone of command

there be few master who
trouble to enquire whether they
pay subordinate be hurt by
they command

oh yes
paid subordinate
i would
forgotten the salary
well on
that mercenary ground will you
consent to speak with i as i
equal without think that the
request arise from insolence

i would never mistake informality for
insolence sir
one i rather
like
the other nothing free
born should ever submit to even
for a salary

humbug
most freeborn thing
would submit to anything for a
salary
but i mentally shake
hand with you for you answer

not three in three thousand
schoolgirl governess would have
answer i as you have just do

you have clearly not spent much
time in the company of schoolgirl
governess
i be the same plain
kind of bird as all the rest
with i couple of accomplishment
and i common tale of woe

i envy you

how

you openness you clear
conscience you unpolluted mind
if i be eighteen i think we truly
would be equal
nature mean i to
be a good man one of the good
kind and as you see i be not so

be you a villain then sir

i be a trite commonplace sinner
hackneyed in all the dissipation
that the rich and worthless try
to put on life
when i be you age fate deal i
a blow
i be curse with a
burden to carry through life
i
lack the wisdom to remain cool
and i turned desperate
dread
remorse miss eyre
it be the
poison of life

and since happiness be denied i
i have a right to get pleasure in
it stead
and i will get it
cost what it may

then you will degenerate still more

be you preaching to i

i be remind you of you own
word
remorse be the poison of
life

but miss eyre if the pleasure i
be seeking be sweet and fresh
if it be an inspiration
if it
wear the robe of an angel of
light
what then

i do not know
to speak truth i
do not understand you at all

i heart have long be a charnel
house
perhaps it will transform
into a shrine

sir i find the conversation have
get out of i depth

you be afraid of i because i
talk like a sphynx

i be not afraid

yes you be

i have simply no wish to talk
nonsense

if you do it would be in such a
grave quiet manner that i would
mistake it for sense
do you
never laugh miss eyre

only rarely perhaps
but you be
not naturally austere any more
than i be naturally vicious
i can
see in you the glance of a curious
sort of bird through the close set
bar of a cage
a vivid restless
resolute captive
be it but free
it would soar
cloud high

just as it turn to come down
that be when you hit it

mademoiselle have get to rest

because i start to win

have mercy adele
play with
pilot for a while

be we game disturbing you sir

on the contrary
i like you game

thornfield

like one of the hag who appear
to macbeth

well i dare
it be feel like a
plague house for year

but thornfield be i home and i
shall like it

mademoiselle il faut jouer

get back
keep at a distance
child or go in

she be the daughter of an opera
dancer Celine Varens
Celine be a
beauty and she professed to love
i
she ardour be so great that
ugly as i be i believe myself she
idol

hotel give she servant gown
cashmere diamond in short i

to fall in love sir

you have never feel love have you
miss eyre
you soul still sleep

you be still floating gently in
the stream of life unaware of
the rock ahead waiting to dash
you to piece

be you dashed to piece mr
rochester

not by Celine
how can one ever
truly love a woman one have paid
for

it end when i visit she
unexpectedly one night and caught
she with she handsome charmless
lover
i overhear she wax
lyrical on all i defect she be
mercenary heartless senseless
the whole intoxication fell away
like a dream
i left she money to
support the little french floweret
over there whom she swear blind
be mine
i see no proof of i grim
paternity in she feature
i think
pilot be more like i than she

but you take she on

some year later i hear that
Celine have abandoned the brat
disappeared to italy and left it
destitute
so i lift it from the
mud and slime of paris and bring
it here to grow up clean in the
wholesome soil of an english
country garden
i one good work in
a sea of countless sin

you listen miss eyre as if it be
the most usual thing in the world
for a man like i to tell story
of he operamistresses to an
inexperienced girl like you
adele

the middle of the floor

water from he stand
do you not hear anything miss

i do
i hear a strange laugh

it be hardly likely the master
would laugh when he be in such
danger
perhaps you be dreaming

you door and looking out

have mr rochester not send for we

favourite of he

oh

i see she two year ago when mr
rochester have a party here
oh
she be a beauty
i daresay the
most elegant girl i have ever see
so tall with raven hair cascade
down she back
i do not know how
she would have it do
she sing a duet
with mr rochester
they make a
lovely harmony

i be quite surprise he do not
make a proposal
perhaps that be
he intention now

Quavez vous mademoiselle

thank you girl
you may go

do you find the work too hard

not at all
i be get on very
well

do you feel the solitude an
oppression

i hardly have time to notice it

then perhaps you accommodation
have disappointed you
they be
in truth scanty enough

few month ago i have nothing
i
be wretched
now i have a home
and work
free and honest
i
wonder at the goodness of god and
at the generosity of i friend

what you have left before i meet
you i do not know
but i counsel
you to resist firmly every
temptation to look back

it be what i mean to do

we can overcome every kind of human
weakness
year ago i be myself
intensely miserable
i considered
i life be so wretched that it
must be changed or i would die
after a season of darkness and
struggling light broke
i hear i
call from god
put you trust in
he jane
let he lead you to you
future

thank you

why be you intensely miserable

year ago i be weak enough to
fall in love

do not pity i
i have no compassion
whatsoever for you
i regard this
love as a fever of the flesh
not a
thing that would ever touch i
soul
i scorned the weakness
fight hard against it and win

i could have listen to
temptation sunk down in the silken
snare and known a feverish and
delusive bliss
i could have
squander i future upon it

you could have be happy

slave in a fool paradise
i would
rather i life have purpose

be this yours

yes

what be the matter

nothing in the world

enough to keep she independent

she be a good hand i daresay

one point

you be recklessly rash about
you own health

nonsense

why be you come

an inhospitable question

i mean on a night like this

i get tire of i mute book and
empty room
besides i have be tell
half a story and i be most impatient
to find out the end

please

twenty year ago a poor curate
fell in love with a rich mane
daughter and married she
she be
disown by she family and two
year later the rash pair be both
dead
they left a daughter which
charity received into she lap as
cold as that snow drift i almost
stick fast in
charity carry the
friendless thing to the house of
it rich maternal relation
it be
rear by an auntinlaw
i come to
name now mrs reed of gateshead

mrs reed keep the orphan ten year
and at the end of that time she be
send to lowood school

it seem she career there be very
honourable
she become a teacher
like yourself and left it like
yourself to be a governess
she
undertake the education of the ward
of a certain mr rochester

mr rivers


i can guess you feeling but hear
i to the end
of mr Rochesters
character i know nothing but he
professed to offer honourable
marriage to this young girl and at
the very altar she discovered that
he have a wife yet alive
he
subsequent conduct be a matter of
pure conjecture but when the
governess be enquire after it be
discover that she have flee
thornfield hall and no trace of she
have since be find
now be not
that an odd tale

since you know so much perhaps
you can tell i how he be

who

mr rochester
how be he

i be ignorant of all concerning he

well since you will not ask the
governess name i must tell
you
i have it written down here
in black and white

solicitor named briggs write to
i of a jane eyre

find you

what do he want with i

merely to tell you that you uncle
mr john eyre of madeira be dead
that he have left you all he
property and that you be now rich

you fortune be vested in the
english fund
briggs have the
will and all the necessary
document
you can enter on
immediate possession

you forehead unbends at last
i
think you be turning to
stone
perhaps now you will ask
how much you be worth

how much be i worth

oh a trifle
twenty thousand
pound but what of that

twenty thousand pound

if you would committed a murder and
i would find you out you could
scarcely look more aghast

there must be some mistake
it be
two thousand surely

it be twenty
you look desperately
miserable about it i must say

why do mr briggs write to you

you see that be the strange thing
it make i wonder what power or
providence lead you to we door

here you be neglect essential
point to pursue trifle
you be
utterly downhearted when i told you

matter of no moment you be
deliriously happy

of no moment
you have sister and
maybe do not care for a cousin but i
have nobody
i have be alone
always
and now three relation be
born into i world full grow
oh i
be glad
you who saved i life

you must try to tranquillise you
feeling

write to diana and mary
tell
they to hand in notice and come
home
they will have five
thousand each and so will you

i have tell you the news too quickly
you be confuse

do not put i out of patience
cousin
i be rational enough
twenty thousand divided equally
between the niece and nephew of
we uncle give five to each

this be acting on first impulse
you do not know what it be to have


and you cannot imagine family
i never have a home
i never have
brother and sister

you be not reluctant to own i
be you

jane i will be you brother

good night

you call jane you sister but you
do not treat she as such
you should
kiss she too

di you be very provoking

good night

you be wasted here

be i not be useful

you should look beyond moor
house beyond the selfish calm
and comfort of affluence

beyond to what

i go to india in six week

so soon


i can see what you gift be and
why they be given
come with i

god and nature intended you for a
missionary wife
you be form
for labour not for love
i want
to claim you not for i
pleasure but for god service

i be not fit for it
i have no
vocation

you be far too humble

st john have mercy
i feel i
mind shrinking

do not be afraid
you be diligent
faithful docile courageous
gentle and heroic
cease to
mistrust yourself
i trust you
unreservedly
let i give you time
to think
but know this
in you i
recognise a fellow soul a soul
that would revel in the flame and
excitement of sacrifice


i used to long for a life of
action to overleap the horizon to
move in the world of man
maybe god
be giving i this
and what be
there for i here
pain and long
for what can not be
i do not know how
long i would survive in india
i
frame be not strong
but i will go
with you if i may go free

free

you and i have well not marry

why not

because i be you sister

but you will go with i

conditionally as you curate

jane i do not need a curate
i
need a wife

i must have i heart and mind
free i own self to turn to
i
could not become part of you

part of i you must become or the
whole bargain be void
how can i a
man not yet thirty take out to
india a girl of nineteen unless
she be i wife
do not offer god
half a sacrifice
he must have all
and undoubtedly enough of love
would follow to make the union
right even in you eye

enough of love

yes quite enough

st john i scorn you idea of
love
i scorn the counterfeit
sentiment you offer and i scorn
you when you offer it

i have utter nothing that
deserve scorn

forgive i but the very name of
love be an apple of discord
between we
i dear cousin
please abandon you scheme of
marriage

no
and if you reject it it be
not i you deny but god

do not be angry with i please
it make i wretched
i want we
to be friend

we be friend
i hope we can be
more

i cannot come as you wife

why this refusal
it make no
sense

if i be to marry you you would
kill i
you be killing i now

i would kill you
i be killing you
you word be violent unfeminine
and untrue

you would kill i without draw any
blood or receiving on you
conscience any stain of crime

what nonsense be this

you would experience no pain but i
tell you it would kill i

why

because i would inevitably come to
conceive love for you because you
be so talented and good because
there be such grandeur in you
look
you would not want this
strange and torture love
if i
show it you would find it
unbecoming
and i lot would be
wretched

jane

you be a good man but you forget
the feeling of little people
we would
well keep out of you way lest
you trample we

i would not trample you
you would
walk at i side towards god
altar
he would be you solace
heaven you reward
we seek to do
the great work to open
death gate to save soul
love god jane love god

give up you heart to he
he be
love

if i be sure
if i be certain



jane
jane
jane

oh god what be it

what have you hear
what can you
see

i be coming

wait for i

where be you


they send i from the inn
i have
be up at the house

come in come in

be he dead

no no
mr rochester still life

tell i please

why do you run away in the night
like that
i would have helped
i
would have helped

he sought you as if you be a lose
and precious jewel
he do not rest
and as day turned into week and
no word come he grow quite savage
in he disappointment

he stay at thornfield

do not leave the house



shut himself up like a hermit
he
only go out at night when he
walk like a ghost through the
ground



he would have no one near he
adele
be send off to school
he place
i here
only john and martha
stay and mrs poole of course



it be harvest time when it
happen
no one know how she
get out



i theory be that when mrs poole
be asleep have taken too much
of the gin and water



the mad lady must have stolen
she key and let herself out

Antoinetta



he do not leave the house until
everyone be out
some say it be a
just judgement on he for have
she confine there all those year
but for i part i pity he

he be alive child but many think
he would be well off dead

why

when he be taken out from under
the ruin a beam have fallen in
such a way as to protect he
partly but he eye be taken
out and he leave hand so crushed
that he lost it
the other eye
inflame and he be blind
he be
blind

i know
it be a terrible thing

i have dreaded bad
i would dread
he be mad

where be he

i can see the candle martha at
you side like a luminous glow
and the fire
a red haze

martha

martha be that you

martha be in the kitchen sir

who be there

pilot know i
will you have
some more water

ditch

refine and exalt

she insult i

and i be an independent woman
i

love best


you be altogether a human being
jane

i conscientiously believe so
sir

but i see that you be turning
into a lion
it be time someone
undertake to rehumanise you

i be a sightless block

and the bad of it be i be in
danger of loving you too well for
this and making too much of you

be i hideous jane

very
but you always be you
