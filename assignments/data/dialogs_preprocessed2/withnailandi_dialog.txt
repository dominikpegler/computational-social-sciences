danny sniff the sausage
Withnail enter from the kitchen glue the
sole back on he shoe
he be wearing a rather expensive look suit

i see you be wearing a suit
what be it get to do with you
no need to get uptight man
i be merely making an observation
i
happen to be looking for a suit for the coal man two week ago
for
reason i can not really discuss with you the coal man have to go to
jamaica
get busted coming back through heathrow have the weight under
he fez
we wored out that it would be handycarma for he to get hold
of a suit but he be a very low temperature spade the coal man go
into court wearing a kaftan and a bell
this do not go down at all
well
they can handle the kaftan but they can not handle the bell
so
there be this judge sitting there sitting in a cape like fuck batman
with this really rather far out looking hat
wig
no man this be more like a long white hat
so he look at the
coalman and say what be all this
this be a court man
this be not
fancy dress and the coal man look at he and say you think you
look normal you honour

cunt give he two year
i be afraid i can not offer you gentleman anything
that be alright danny
we would decided to lay off for a bit
that be what i think
except for personal use i concur with you
as a
matter of fact i be think of retire and going into business
do what
the toy industry

they be like that the little girl
so we be going to make one that
shit itself too

of i ability
i do not advise a hair cut man
all hairdresser be in the employment
of the government
hair be you aerial
they pick up signal from
the cosmos and transmit they directly into the brain
this be the
reason boldheaded man be uptight

then why be he wearing that old suit
old suit
this suit be cut by hawkes of saville row
just because
the good tailoring you have ever see be above you fuck appendix

then
you get horrible drink and they can not fucking touch you
accord to these instruction you refuse everything except a
urine sample

Dannys a genius
i be going to have a doze
they drive on
later with the light fade they leave the
motorway
it become clear that the car have only one function
headlight
still later it be totally dark and rain heavily
i
stop and attempt to transfer the single wiper from Withnails
side of the car to he own but it refuse to come off
he get
