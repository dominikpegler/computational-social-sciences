than upset or afraid
but she never
turned up
i called the house but only
get the answer machine
when they find
she
she would be going the wrong way
not the direction she would have go if
she would be coming to see i

maybe she
just wanted to drive

how do you come to have i address

to make they take the
early s away from you

jeweller up the west end
we
tunnel we way under the shop floor
from the public lavatory down the road
filthy work
trouble be the bloody
thing collapsed
after
we would make the
grab n all
would you adam n eve it

you mean if they would nab you before you
actually broke and entered you would only
have be charged with making a mess

we be
lucky
to be nicked
i and the
lad go down there sunday evening we
be not discover till the monday
good
job we be still breathing

it do not discourage you though

hey

model prisoner

not
bloody likely

i be inside once
i punched a cop at a
demo

do you
what be that in aid of

who remember

get seven year do you

overnight
what about just now

just now
playful go over ready for
more
overnight

you
have
be away
lie back regards he
carefully
or be all this just new to you

it be true
have to be say
i get off to
a slow start

i do not believe it

honest
do not know where to look till i
be

push the legal limit even then

i mate introduced i to a woman up the
street
funnily enough she be marry
to a milkman
straight up
i said
good be she
be around
he said

good
listen mush it be not that she be
be around it be that she be be around
hell of a long time


you most recent incarceration
what be
that for

it be for nine year
the last nine year







i have live in

all i life i have
never do this drive

all you life
that happen while i
swim the length of i pool

what be the matter

nothing
i guess it be hard to pass on
this road

the freeway fast but lack a certain
majesty

just feel like the car behind have be
following we the long time

i sure hope so



all i be sayin be travel time should not
be the same rate
travel time be down
time right
i mean we be not even in
the same car as the client
you told i the job be at the house
when we get to it
well be we shadowing
the client right now or be we just going
the same way
the company i be with in
seattle these distinction be make
now i do not dispute
he
get the full
whack
seniority and all that
but if i be
get paid the same hourly rate when
we be at the
house
as i be in this car
that do not sit well with i and i feel
oblige to say so
because in seattle
what you be paying
now
for socalled
travel time be half what we get for
actual clocktime with the client
so i
just feel we should get more when the job
actually
commence

i would really like to eat you pussy





after laughing loudly at a
handicap person
i believe in mocking the afflict
