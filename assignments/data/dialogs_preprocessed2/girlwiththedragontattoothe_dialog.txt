what be this the media event of the
year

will not work

do not try to play it up that will not
either



will you appeal

i will appeal to you Viggo
find a
real story to cover

financial journalist mikael Blomkvist
be find guilty today on count
of aggravate libel against financier
HansErik Wennerstrom





in an article published early
this year Blomkvist claimed
Wennerstrom founder and president
of the Wennerstrom group used state
fund intended for industrial
development in poland for an arm
deal with the rightwing ustashe in
croatia
the report cut to a shot of Wennerstrom outside the
courthouse in an armani suit surround by he legal
team confidently address the reporter

i have nothing against mr
Blomkvist
he be a good journalist
who i do not believe be guided by
malice
but what he write be
inaccurate and inaccuracy can not go
unanswered
he all journalist
have to accept like the rest of we
action have consequence
do with he sandwich Blomkvist go to the counter

marlboro red
and a lighter


he come out tamp the pack
extract a cigarette
toss the pack in a sidewalk trash bin
flick at the
lighter but can not get it to fire in the wind and rain
hunch he body around it coax it to life

Blomkvist be ordered to pay
thousand in damage and all court
cost which could be significantly
more
he take a long drag that dizzies he
wonderful
feel
he regards the trash bin
fish around it
find the pack put it in he coat pocket




he come through past christmas decoration and a mostly
young staff
they try not to regard he as a deadman
walking but be not entirely successful
he enter the
editor office



where you be
erika berger be about Blomkvists age and like the
furniture send a mixed message
a feminist in a
miniskirt

walk
think

smoke

just one
he sit exhaust and depress in a cheap Poang chair

called
i told they no
statement until we have read the
judgment in it entirety

i have
who else

everyone who be ever wanted to see
you humiliate

you have be on the phone all day
then

i be as much to blame for this as you

you be
you write it

i read it
i run it

not the same

we credibility be not dead mikael

mine be
they regard each other in another silence
then



i be tire
i feel like climb
under a duvet and sleeping for a
week

alone

i already called greger and told he
i would not be home tonight





it be possible we could wait forever

you called she i think
you speak
to she

i be afraid that do not mean much

i do not understand

no one here like she
so it be
well if she work at home

but you told she i wanted to meet
she

but i have tell she many more time i
prefer she not to meet client





but you like she

very much
she be one of the good
investigator i have
as you see
from she report



but

i be concern you will not like she
she be different

in what way

in every way





ms
Salanders here

Lisbeth mr
Dirch Frode

how do you do


she do not shake Frodes hand but do address he

something wrong with the report

no
it seem quite thorough
there be a wealth of data here
but
i be also interest to know what be
not in it

there be nothing not in it

you opinion of he be not

i be not paid to give i opinion

so you do not have one
salander send Armansky a weary look
he look back
beg she not to say anything unpleasant
eventually

he be clean
in i opinion

he be excuse i

he be honest
he be who he present
himself to be
in he business
that be an asset

there be less in he asset column
after he conviction today

that be true
he make a fool of
himself with that
if it happen
that way
Frode look at Armansky
what be that suppose to mean

if he make up the story that be
out of character
so be giving up
without a fight
people do not do
thing that be out of character

be you saying he be set up



that be not part of i assignment
and apparently she have no opinion on it either

you be quite right he make a fool of
himself professionally
how big of a
fool do he make of himself
financially

the judgement will just about empty
he saving
this seem to please Frode more than anything else that
have be say and salander see it

may i go

you report be light in another
area
he personal life
anything
you choose not to include

nothing that warrant inclusion

i be not sure if that mean yes or no

i think what ms
salander mean and
i agree be that everyone have a right
to a certain amount of privacy even
when they be be investigate

not in this case
i have to know
if there be anything about he i might
find unsavory even if she do not
Armanskys look to she at once apologize for Frode and
encourage she to speak
she finally relent but put no
more spin on it than any other piece of raw data

he be have a long sexual relationship
with he coeditor
it wrecked his
marriage but not hers
she husband
accept it
sometimes she sleep at
Blomkvists sometimes at home
Frode think about that perhaps imagine how much
simple he own life would be with such an arrangement



you be right not to include that

i know

anything else

no

please think before you say no

i do

i do not want to be surprise by
something later
salander offer nothing more

so
nothing else
in the personal
department
you be sure

he like sandwich




Blomkvist be not sentimental but do have a few frame
snapshot
he daughter he sister and one with erika
in they s in which he be wearing a black leather
jacket
she wake up alone in he bed
pad to the darken
live room to find he typing on he laptop a half
eat sandwich and glass of water next to it

usually when i wake up in a cold
bed it be at home

sorry

what be you do



write the press release

say

you be taking over as publisher
you be sorry for any nuisance
Wennerstrom be cause
i can not be
reach for comment

you be giving up

just taking a few step aside
for you

this make i sick





salander sit alone at a table waiting for someone with
a coffee and a gift haphazardly wrapped with a christmas
bow the price tag still on it a paperback book i
memorable game by bobby fischer
she notice the price
tag be still on it
peel it off

softly inside but no one answer
she try the door
it be unlock
the gift in hand she push it open
she come into an apartment which look like it could
belong to a professor
see a chess piece on the floor
then a trail of they that lead she to an overturn chess
table and next to it a body
the gash on the old mane head could have be cause
by a fall into the corner of the table or from a blow to
it
she quickly try to determine if he be breathing
call for an ambulance

even more cut off from the people around she than usual
completely alone

make it way north

Blomkvist stare out at the bleak northern landscape


Blomkivist disembarks to find Frode who he can only
assume be Frode beyond a veil of snow waving to he
from outside a mercedes
unlike Blomkvist he be dressed
for this godawful weather in a furcollared topcoat


Frodes mercedes come across a long bridge linking the
old industrial town to a rocky island

that be what you wish


the car come up a long baretreelined drive lead
to a stately manor
as Frode and Blomkvist climb out a
distant gunshot echo but neither Frode nor the old man
who appear at the front door of the manor pay it any
attention

i brother along with they
wife child and grandchildren
have gathered here for we loathsome
annual board meet and dinner
it

it autumn parade





harriet and a couple of school
friend have go into town to watch
it
she return a little after two
of the clock



she come to the parlor
she ask
if she could talk to i
i honestly
do not remember what i be do that
i think be more important but i
told she to give i a few minute

but in a few minute before i could
go upstairs to talk to she something
else occur



the accident have nothing to do with
harriet and everything



it be chaos as everyone drop what
they be do



police an ambulance fire brigade
reporter photographer and onlooker
quickly arrive from town as those
of we on the island the family
hurried to the bridge from we side


the truck driver have managed to climb out of he cab but
the other motorist be trapped

the driver of the car a mr
Aronsson be pinned and severely
injure
all we could do be try to
pry he out with we hand since
metal tool could spark
local newspaper photographer and another man snap
picture as Vanger and other try without success to pry
the injure driver from he car
as the chaos ensue

about twenty minute after the crash
harriet be in the kitchen
anna

anna glance to harriet as she come in then back out
the window to the bridge
harriet pass a clock that
read
step outside walk toward the wood


as the sun set Vanger and the other on the bridge make
progress extract the driver from the car
young man
coming from the town side take off he jacket to help

we finally get poor Aronsson out of
he car and off to the hospital and
those of we on we side drift back
to the house


the family have assembled at a long dine table

the sun be down the excitement
over we sit down to dinner
that be
when i notice harriet be not there
Vanger consider an empty chair as everyone else
including the young man from the bridge he jacket
draped on he chair pass platter of food around

and she be not there the next
morning
or the next
or the next
forty year







Vanger have the same look of concern on he face now as he
lead Blomkvist up some stairs

what be she going to tell i
why
do not i make time for she
why
do not i listen

she could not have run away

not without be see


the crew continue they work under light

fireman stay on the bridge all
night pumping out the gasoline
and
no one swim across or take a row
boat
all of they be still tied up
on this side sunday
believe i we
check



she could not have fallen and drowned

the current be not strong here
anything that fall into the water
turn up nearby
like she father
he body do not drift more than ten
meter when he drown the year
before
Vangers pause at a land to steady himself and he
labored breathe

no
someone killed she mr
Blomkvist
someone on the island
that day
someone close enough to
know what she used to give i each
year on i birthday
he unlock the door of the attic and push it open to
reveal a cluster of nine dusty frame dry flower on a
wall



these be from she

these from she killer

who know about these

i the police the murderer
and now you







when the police investigation peter
out i keep at it





study they report and
interview all the information there
be and it be a lot
i have spent half
i life examining the event of a
single day

i understand you frustration
but what you be asking i to do be
a waste of money

we have not discuss you fee

we do not need to
i can not find
something you have not be able to
in forty year

you do not know that
you have a
very keen investigative mind

here what i propose
you come
stay on the island
i have a nice
little cottage by the water you can
use
you study the material i give
you
you find something i have missed
or you do not

you want i to set aside i life
and career for something that be a
complete waste of time

think of it as a well deserve
vacation
way of avoiding all the
people you want to avoid right now
as for compensation i will pay you
twice you salary for as many month
as it take
i will quadruple it if
you solve the mystery



mr


i be not do
i will throw in one
more thing even though you be a
terrible negotiator
it be what you
want more than anything else and it
can not be buy at any price
i will
give it to you
HansErik
Wennerstrom
he push toward Blomkvist a plate
the carcass of the
freshkilled and cook duck they have be eating
it and
the mention of Wennerstroms name cloud at least for a
moment Blomkvists memory of the train he missed

he begin he career working for i
and i have follow it with interest
shall we say ever since
you be
right about he
you just could not
prove it




salander climb a flight of stairs in a build that
could not be more different than Wennerstroms
knock
on a door wait listen to some deadbolts unlock
it open but remains impassable by a figure weigh
over pound
he offer she no greet
fade back
into the shadow of he dark apartment

would you like to sit
i could
possibly clear a place if necessary
it be hard to imagine how he or anyone might accomplish
that
the place be like a junkyard
even the unmade bed
be covered with stuff

do you make it

have you something for i
she take some cash from a pocket hand it to he
he
count it and be unimpressed with it total

i be on welfare
i do not administer
it
this be not enough



i have to pay three month back rent
and eat a little bit
it be all i
have right now

i find that so poignant
so much so that he do nothing more than look at she
she reach to take the money back but he pocket it and
move across the dark room to a work table where highend
computer fight for space with debris
find and give
she a small homemade electronic box which she turn over
in she hand
while it be clear both these people be deficient in
behavior that govern polite society it be hard to tell
which lack it more

no thank you



erika first to arrive this morning or so she think
come through the empty office with a waynes coffee to
go cup but Blomkvist be already there packing supply
from he desk book from he shelf
second suitcase
presumably full of clothes sit on the floor

you can not be serious


he zip the suitcase with the supply in it closed and
gather the rest

we be in we bad crisis ever and
you be writing a memoir

they cross through the build he with he case she
with she coffee cup



Wennerstrom want to see i waving
a white flag not a red one
and the
more it look like there be a problem
between you and i the more it will
satisfy he

there be a problem between we
he
will not be satisfy until he shut we
down and you be leaving i to fight
he alone

it be four hour by train
it be not
the north pole

he be there that day

indeed he be

that be he daughter Cecilias house
they do not speak

do anyone speak to anyone on this
island

of reason i do not speak to she
Cecilias brother birger life there

i beg you




the police patrol boat and two Peterssons motor around
the island spotlight the shore and rocky cliff


the weird tableau of character awaiting they
interview with morell
at the moment he be across the
room with harald Vanger taking note drink coffee

Blomkvist read patrol and orienteering
club volunteer assembled
a
m









search party crisscross the island wade through
ditch check old barn shine flashlight up chimney
woodsman with blood hound comb through wood

we search for day


train bisect the landscape
Blomkvist look out

eventually much to he dismay and
mine i have to talk to henrik about
calling it off


as the search continue morell looking like he have not
sleep which he have not peer down a rocky cliff to the
water
somehow he know they be never going to find she

the fact that i never find a body
do not surprise i
you can not dig
up an entire island





the same face forty year old the man who speak to
Vanger on the phone about the dry flower now speak
with Blomkvist as he scrape out the bowl of he pipe



but i also could not find a motive
be it spontaneous
be it planned
do she know something someone wished
she do not
be it about business

business
she be sixteen

and very bright
henrik told i he
could easily imagine she running the
business someday which would mean
someone else would not

she be with some friend that day
at a parade
you must have talk to
they

she told they she be not feeling
well

i have remind you of thing you would

returning to one taking out the
file uselessly study they
as
young man we have to laugh

be this also a miss girl case

the Rebecka case be something that
happen before harriet be born

policeman
poor Torstensson could
never solve it and could never let
it go

discrepancy between the obligation of
mr

management of you finance

it be not a discrepancy or a problem
it be clear to he i could manage i
own finance

because this be important
she do
in a way that say i would like to kill you

here
so it would come as a shock to no
one if i choose an alternative to the
lenient arrangement i just outlined
be that what you be saying with you
silence
you would prefer
institutionalization


salander step into the elevator hit the down button
as the door close


martins house do not look so far away but the road
Blomkvist have to climb to reach it and the fact he like
all writer be out of shape tax he

hop in


martin wearing an apron open the door to find both he
dinner guest on the porch

immediately think of one in i
business

you be writing a book now martin
said

i love henrik
he be fascinating
martin too
together they be the
old sweden and the new

they be

you know about harriet right
Blomkvist do not say
the sound of the wind stop

you do not

i do
martin emerge from the cellar with a bottle of wine in
hand and return with it to the dine room

the family do not like to talk about
it but it can not just be sweep under
the rug

what can not

harriet
martin do not comment
just nod
silence
then


dragon tattoo final

maybe we could talk about that
later

we can talk about it now
liv know everything about i crazy
family
which be why she will never
marry i

that be one reason
she hold up she leave hand
wedding ring be on it
the couple seem very comfortable with each other not
unlike Blomkvist and erika

do not put that in you book
anything else be fine
harriet
certainly
everything changed after
that
not just the family but the
company

how so

we be not Nordea or ericsson but
we be still the large familyowned
company in the country
at the
height we have employee
we
have about half that now and that
downward slide anyone can tell you
begin after i sister death
it
broke Henriks entrepreneurial
spirit and he heart
and martins too clearly
Blomkvist dare to ask as
innocently as possible

you be here that day

everyone be here though i do not
get in until after the accident on
the bridge
the
train

i know it well



it be a terrible day
and the day
after searching and not finding she
be even bad

this event mikael have to be a
big part of you book





hi
i think i would come over and say
hello
i be cecilia



we be all uncomfortable with the
idea of a chronicle of we family



it be not about the family
it be
about henrik and the company

like i said

it be not i intention to present a
malicious portrait of anyone

unlike the one that landed you in
court

unlike that one
correct

so what you be saying be you be
not really here to look into what
happen to harriet
silence
then

i can not ignore such a dramatic event
but no that be not by any mean i
focus

so all those box gunner cart
down here which be where
in the
closet now
be not Henriks
private investigation
Blomkvist can not think fast
enough to respond
i wonder sometimes who be crazy i
nazi father or i obsess uncle
of the photo of young harald in he nazi uniform
on the wall

since we be talking about it since
you bring it up what be harriet
like

i be sure henrik have tell you

know what be really going on with a
teenager any more than i can with i
own daughter

you do not know where you own sister
live

i have not see she in year

that be the way it be when you be
always after the same boy

people generally get over that sort
of thing at a certain point

oh i be long over it and will not
ever have to worry about it again

dawn light outside the live room window
Bjurman at he dine table with a glass of orange
juice writing out a check

concern
she nod
he hand she the check
then open
the door for she like a perfect gentleman

so next saturday here


she nod
leave
the door close


lone figure hobble through the empty street


she set a check down
on the memo line he be neatly
written for food
she take a bottle of water from
the fridge and drink


shower water hit the dragon tattoo on she shoulder
blade and run down past several other
by the time the
water reach the drain it have turn red


coming through tree with a bag of grocery Blomkvist
see a park outside he cottage


Blomkvist tap on the care foggedup driver window
hand inside wipe at it revealing erika
she lower
it a crack

be it any warm inside

no


as he try to get some log in the fireplace going
use more page torn from one of he book erika wrap
herself in a blanket
the cat who have no trouble with
the cold nap on the paperwork on the desk

what have i missed besides you

the steady exodus of twothirds of
we advertiser

seriously

be that hard to believe
sitting up
here in Lappland with you cat



i be not
i be working

i can see
what she can see be the Vanger research covering the
wall and table surface and that the thread of the
family tree lead to a photograph of Vanger at the top

would you like to meet he

maybe in about an hour
if you be
interest
he be


Vanger and martin all but ignore Blomkvist as they chat
with erika over dinner
they seem charm by she

i apologize if you be have
financial problem at the magazine
in Mikaels absence

we will work through they

be you sure
erika look at Blomkvist but he have not talk to they
about this

how long do you think you can hang
on
six month or so

that sound about right

you know i used to be in the
newspaper business
we owned six
daily back in the s

we still own one
the courier here
in town



i let i nephew birger run it since
he can not run anything else
erika nod politely

so what do you say to taking on a
partner

we have never considered it before
we value we independence

you independence be dependant on
advertiser if we be be honest
however much you think that be you would
retain
we do not care about content
Blomkvist suddenly feel like someone coming late to a
party

excuse i
do i miss something

we be talking about an investment in
the magazine

i gather
why would you want to do
that

not for the return that be for sure

i feel bad that i have take mikael
away from you at the bad possible
time
this be the right thing to do
the moral thing
that be one reason

and

the enemy of i friend be i
enemy
i hate Wennerstrom as much
as you hate what he be do to you
silence

so what do you say


erika halfshrugs to say she will consider it

be that a maybe
she nod

wonderful
more wine anna
Blomkvist look at erika but she glance away to Vanger

i think mikael be adapt well to
rustic life by the way

have you see he try to make a fire

Blomkvist have return to the accident photo
pause
on a blurry one of the fire crew the focus inadvertently
on the background Vangers manor
what caught he attention be a figure in one of the
upstairs window
he check a scribble floor plan of
the manor and see that it be harriets bedroom
but he be not sure if it be harriet
the figure be too
soft to identify even with a magnifying glass but be
wearing a lightcolored dress and have light hair
he glance to the family tree on the wall the teenage
Vanger girl photo
three
harriet
cecelia
anita
they all have light hair and frankly all look alike
he move on to the parade picture
to the one Vanger
said before be the last picture taken of harriet alive
it be not really of she


it be a wide shot of the parade itself but she can be
see in the background across the street with she
friend watch a float atop which some woman in
harem outfit dance pass by
he slip it from it cornerfasteners and turn it over
there be a Hedestad courier copyright printed on the back
he turn it over again and look at the photo itself


guide by the photo he walk along the town main
street to the approximate place from which it be taken
outside a haberdashery window but it be still not right
the photo be shoot from a high than street level angle
he look to a second story window above the store
then
cross the street to where harriet be standing when the
picture be taken
look back at the haberdashery where
now the owner peer out at he


on the pay phone outside the gas station

i want to look at what the paper
have in it archive on the parade

you already have what it have
in
the album

i do not think so

why

because no photographer at any
newspaper in the world take just two
photo of anything especially after
have to climb a flight of stairs

the bridge accident happen during
the parade
he rush over

maybe
silence
then

mikael what have you find



nothing probably
but i know
photographer
they be the most
insecure people on earth
if it be
out of focus or they do not like
the frame they bury it




Blomkvist follow the paper youngish photo editor up
narrow stairs to an attic

the current archive be on cd
naturally
the old stuff still
negative
what general period be
you interested in

september
she glance back at he
the date mean something to
she but she choose not to comment


she pull four thick binder off a shelf from september
alone proving Blomkvists point about photographer
and pile they up next to a lightbox and scanner

thank you
he wait for she to leave
she seem reluctant to

be this about harriet Vanger

you be too young to know about that

everyone here grow up knowing about
she
it be how we be taught about
stranger


the door open revealing salander
Bjurman seem a
little surprise to see she at he doorstep

i dear Lisbeth how be you



i need more money
i need to pay i
rent
she look like a schoolgirl with she little backpack over
she shoulder
how do he ever get so lucky

come on in
she step inside
he take she hand and lead she
toward the bedroom
she other hand slip into she jacket
pocket

since we be still figure out what
you like i go shop for some
new toy

i too

you too
what do you buy
she pull a Taser from she pocket and jam it under his
chin firing off volt


set down on the rugged landscape under an almost moonless
night sky the cottage look vulnerable


the cat curled up on a chair jerk it head up at a
sound neither we nor Blomkvist can hear and stay
absolutely still listening
Blomkvist scroll through the courier negative he have
convert into positive and have loaded into photoshop
he be right
many more parade picture be shoot that
day
several at street level a marching band float
child with balloon some in good focus than other
he reach the first of the higherangle shot from the
floor above the haberdashery scan the crowd lining the
street
harriet be not in it
but in the next she appear at the edge of the frame
with she school friend
in the next she be far into
frame
and the next stand in the same spot he stand
early today






Blomkvist select all of the highangle parade
photograph transfer they to an iPhoto file and
reopen they as a slide show

the first few accompany by the default music minuet
in dissolve at twosecond interval
too long
too
distracting with the music
and too wide
he adjust the size function closer on harriet get
rid of the dissolve effect and music and reduce the time
interval to make the transition as quick as possible
he hit play again and watch a short jerky silent
film a kind of electronic flipbook
harriet arrive with she friend
move along the
street
stop and face the parade
say something to
she friend
laugh
watch the float with the harem
girl on it
smile
see something to she left
turn
she head slightly toward it
she eye widen in fear
she look down
she move off
she friend look after
she confused
and then she be go
Blomkvist back up to the frame of harriet looking off
with fear in she eye and for the first time believe
without a doubt what Vanger have believe for year
she be murdered
whoever she see across the street
follow she and killed she
the cat watch he


Bjurman slowly come to

she regards the surveillance monitor the nightvision
view of the cottage
she can not believe it but she feel
vigilant more for he sake than she own
she go to a window and look out
see she own
reflection in the glass and study it
then kick she
boot off


she come into the bedroom in she tshirt and underwear
he be still muttering without looking at she

it be not an accident
somebody be shooting at i

she pull she tshirt over he stitchedup head
cocoon it against she breast
silence
then

apart from the fact that i be old we
work together

you work with what ishername

she climb on top of he


afterwards
she open he dwindle pack of cigarette
light one
glance over to he lying next to she
he be
not looking at the smoke but rather the startle tattoo
on she bare leg and arm
eventually

you want i to open a window
he shake he head no
reach for the cigarette
take
a drag
hand it back


he wake

but not altogether unpleasant silence you always hear in
this situation the next morning
she break it

establish


Frode and martin stare at Blomkvists unprofessionally
sutured head wound

bodyguard

people hunt on the island mikael
gunner out there shooting something
almost every day for he dinner

not from gunner
if he wanted to
shoot he he would have shoot he



we get poacher

and the parade photo he be wearing the same blazer
he shuffle through copy of article in Salanders
victim file
look at the last one lena andersson

knowing what she be looking for now salander find it
fairly quickly
clip about a timber company Vanger

paper with gottfried two day after Maris murder
she jump to magda Lovisa Sjoberg Karlstad and
an article in it local paper this time with a photo of
gottfried about a union dispute at it factory there


Blomkvist come out with he cell phone try to make a
bar or two materialize on it
dial but only get a beep
that ask he if he want to retry
he do not
instead under the darken sky he look off to the
point
martins house be small in the distance but he
can see there be no car in the driveway and no light on
he stare at it for a long time


salander pull a Uddevalla paper from the file
same day this time the same page of the newspaper
lea
Perssons horrific murder and an story quoting gottfried
about an expansion project to the town harbor
she regards Gottfrieds newsprint photo
he face look
more than year old than the one in kalmar but that be
what drink to excess and murder perhaps do to you


Blomkvist lay the lena andersson article and the
photograph of the figure at the parade atop the rest of
the junk on the desk and quickly scroll through photo
on he laptop leaving on the screen for salander to see
when she return
martins recent Vanger industry
portrait




salander have hit a snag
get up
we stay to have a
look at the problem she leaf
the victim list now
with gottfried jot down next to all but one name
lena andersson uppsala
next to it the newspaper article about the murder
girl with a school photo
and next to that the reason
there be no gottfried notation
he obituary in a
Hedestad courier clip

we listen to the fade echo of Salanders footstep


as annoy as the old woman be it be less creepy
with she around
salander be alone in the old build
now wandering through it looking for vend machine
she find some
drop coin in one
cup fill with
coffee
she get a candy bar from another
the coffee
machine finish
the place again plunge into silence
she start back with she snack down a hallway


trying to look like he be just out for a stroll
Blomkvist walk past martins dark house then turn
around walk up the front path to the porch and make a
show of knocking on the door just in case anyone on the
island can see he which be doubtful in this darkness
he try the door
lock
come down off the porch as
if leaving but then veer off the path and walk around
to the side of the house
he peer through a floortoceiling window but can not
see much inside
come around to the back and look in
another window
try the back door
unlock


he can not see a lot in the dark but do not dare switch
on any light
he cross through the kitchen but we
stay behind to regard a close basement door
we pick he up again as he come into the live room
follow he to a wall of glass
it be pitch black outside
we follow he down a hallway but stop at a bedroom
doorway as if this be as far as we care to go
we stay
at the threshold and watch he go in and look around
as
he begin rummage around the recess of a closet




pair of headlight come across the bridge


Blomkvist come back to the wall of glass
still no
light out there
head off to the hall again


the car park fifty yard from Blomkvists cottage
the
headlight blink off
someone climb out


Blomkvist come into a study
lots of book and frame
photograph
he begin looking around


the headlight come up the road leading to the point


Blomkvist approach a gun case in the study
hunting
rifle
three of they and an empty space for a fourth
one
the tree outside the study window flare with light

moment late Blomkvist hear a sound of tire on gravel
martin be back and Blomkvist be in he house
we rush back down the hall with Blomkvist
hopefully
martin will enter through the front door because we be
going to try to get out the back one
Blomkvist trip over something in the dark and we go down
with he
then up again through the kitchen past the
basement door grab a knife from a drawer shove it
in a back pocket hurry out the rear door


Blomkvist try to steady he breathe as he slink
around the side of the house
as he pass a window it
light up and we again hit the ground with he
he hurry across the yard trip over something in the
dark a sprinkler
and go down again into wet muck
he get up and start down the road as if returning from
a leisurely evening walk which would be more convince
without the limp not daring to look back as he go



hello
mikael
Blomkvist stop
he heart pound
martin come down
he porch and walk toward he car

you evening stroll

hi

martin pull a golf bag from he trunk and shoulder it

i stopped at the hospital on i way
home
henrik ask i to ask you
something

what

come on in i will make you a drink
naturally this be the last thing Blomkvist want to do
but it would be more suspicious if he refuse
he head
back to martins house trying not to limp


finish with she candy bar and coffee salander open
the file look through the clipping for anything
of note in uppsala where lena be killed
she find no news of factory opening there that year
but she do come across a newsletter about a winter
retreat for fifty employee and they family

worker of the year plaque
and another taken at a dinner
for twenty guest and Vanger family member
the camera have capture henrik preside at the head of
the table putting on a brave face raising a champagne
flute as everyone else do the same except for the
young man at the far right foreground
he look sullen
but what teenager would not at an event
as bore as this
salander would look even more sullen
she check the caption and read
far right martin Vanger currently study in

martin be wearing that strike she
an uppsala private
school blazer with a lion on it pocket the same as on
lena Anderssons sweater in the photo of she in the
article about she murder

fact there be a killer in it
martin set the golf club
down and begin emptying a grocery bag in the kitchen

she to i


as salander get the door open with she key and come in

mikael
he be clearly not here
she go to the closet
take
out the surveillance
put it on the desk next to
Blomkvists laptop which be now display not the
photo of martin he left for she but the apple default
light spider screen saver
as salander begin rewind the capture surveillance
image backwards at high speed to get to early in the
day


martin reframes the video camera to include part of
himself in the shot sit again and cross he leg like
this be a talk show


dragon tattoo final

so what would you like to know
there be so many thing but also no point so Blomkvist
say nothing

you be the journalist ask i
something
nothing from Blomkvist
which be okay with martin
he
can do this alone

what do i do with i guest
be that
the question
well before i do
what we be do
relax have a
drink converse
i like that part a
lot have a chat when you both
know one of you be going to die
after i simply get rid of they
out to sea
unlike i father leaving they
scattered all over the place like
trophy
that be not smart if you
ask i
that be just garish and loud
but he be a garish and loud man
frankly he get what he deserved
nothing from Blomkvist but he be wonder now what
happen to gottfried if the drown be not accidental

you can not be a sloppy technician like
that
you can not drink to excess
like he do
this take discipline
it be a science of a thousand detail
the planning
the execution
the
cleanup
i be sure i do not have to
tell you you be going to make quite a
mess
nothing from Blomkvist but martin nod
how do you do this and still function in normal
society


that be the interesting thing
because most of the time i be just
like everyone else
i just have a
big secret
it be wonderful really
standing there waiting for a train
or on a street corner as people brush
past i
you know what i mean


dragon tattoo final

you have secret
you have one when
you come up here
it make you feel
special
do not it
Blomkvist do not say
martin be a little throw by
Blomkvists next unspoken comment

no
i be not a rapist
of course i
do that too and at one time it be
enough but
gather he thought to
explain it
rapist mikael get off on
domination
i need
discard a few other word
before

destruction
martin get up and set about the business of
immobilizing Blomkvist **further/far with a blockandtackle
contraption of chain and strap

can i ask you something
why do not
people trust they instinct
they
sense something wrong someone
walking too close behind they yet
they do not cross the street
you
know something be wrong you even
know what it be but you come back
into the house
do i force you
do i grab you and drag you in
i
just offered you a drink
you would never think the fear of
offending could be strong than the
fear of pain but you know what
it
be
they always come willingly
it amaze he
it always amaze he
he keep working

and then they be here
they know
it be over like you do and still
somehow think they have a chance
maybe if i say the right thing if
i be polite or i cry and beg maybe
i will survive

and then the moment come when they
realize
no all hope be go



and when that happen when i see
the hope draining from they face
like it be from yours right now
whisper like it be just
between they
well i feel myself get hard
just watch it
silence

say something

you be a sick fuck

be this an interview or an
editorial
Blomkvist of course do not answer or comment yet
martin consider what the journalist have not say
martin civilized people do not do what you do


you be right this behavior be
unacceptable
i know that
but
we be not completely different
we
both have desire
satisfy mine
just require more towel
martin regards Blomkvist in a silence
then

anything else you want to know
you sure
all right
whatever you say
he yank a chain that feed through the pulley that lift
Blomkvist up onto he foot


salander watch the surveillance image forward
Blomkvist leaving the cottage and property on foot
Blomkvist returning to the cottage going back inside
Blomkvist coming out and attempting a call on he cell
Blomkvist going back inside the cottage
Blomkvist coming out again and leaving the property
Blomkvist not coming back
nothing but the sky darken to night
then


headlight coming through frame
figure appear on foot at the front gate
the figure just standing there looking at the cottage
the figure approaching it and as it be trying the lock
front door the motion detection light snap on and
illuminate martin
martin moving to the side looking in a kitchen window
coming around front again walking to the gate turning
around looking back then walking out of frame


Blomkvist hang from the blockandtackle rig leather
strap around he neck now feed through a ceiling eyelet
with a big sew scissors martin cut through and
remove Blomkvists pants and underwear

it might amuse you to know that
while you be over here have
dinner with i and liv who by the
way find i very conventional
irina be down here in the cage
who be irina you ask
girl i meet

he return to he work bench to lay out various tool
next to he gun and a desk phone

martin come back quickly and yank a strap that cinches
the noose tight around Blomkvists neck as it lift he
onto he tiptoe

what happen to she

you be choking i

you find she

martin just stare at he confuse

he let we go of the strap and Blomkvists foot come back
down to the floor
as martin return to he workbench
Blomkvist be not only scare to death but confuse now
do martin not kill she
then martin be back in front of he with a roll of
cellophane pull on the strap again until Blomkvist be
balance on he tiptoe and tie it off

too tight to talk
it be
Blomkvist can utter no sound but a gag

good
i be tire of talking to you
he wrap Blomkvists head in cellophane completely
cutting off he ability to breathe and calmly watch
he struggle


would you like i to do something
about that
Blomkvist desperately nod as he be about to suffocate
martin watch another several moment
then poke a
finger through the cellophane into Blomkvists gasping
mouth

see
i be not a monster
he frame a wide shot of he naked prey
turn on some
music
take a moment to collect himself from all this
strenuous work
brush back he hair like he want to
look presentable in the shot
then smile pleasantly

you know i have never have a man in
here
i have never touched a man as a
matter of fact
except i father of
course
but that be i duty
harriets too
the circulation to Blomkvists head be be cut off by
the strap
he finger behind he naked back claw at the
concrete wall to try to relieve some of the weight on the
noose but can not get a grip
martin watch the struggle
calmly and just as calmly offer

it be time
i do not want to be late
for i date with we girlfriend


dragon tattoo final
he put on a plastic rain poncho
painter mask
plastic goggle
surgeon glove
pick up a hunt
knife
step up to Blomkvist
look at he eye
bring he own head close to he victim

goodbye mikael
he pull the strap lifting Blomkvists toe off the
floor closing off he air again
and be about to gut
he like a wild boar
when he hear a sound like some
kind of animal behind he
he turn and see she coming at he from out of the
shadow by the steel door
he dart for the gun he left on the workbench
salander just as quickly swing a iron he iron
like a baseball bat
it metalwedged end arc through
the gloom and slam into the side of he head sending
he tumbling to the floor
he struggle up to he knee and she swing the club
again split flesh and crush bone as he crumple
the floor
she take the gun from the bench and shove it in she
other back pocket
grab the hunt knife and shackle
key and hurry over to Blomkvist who only witness part
of the spectacle before losing consciousness
she saw through the leather strap around he neck
unlock the chain
as he sink to he knee on the
floor blood rush to he head bringing he back to
life just enough to see what she can not behind she
martin blood streaming from the gash in he head
get to he foot
but he be not coming at they
he be
trying to get out
Blomkvist try to say she name to get she to look
lift a hand to try to point
she turn and glimpse the
monster as he disappear out the steel door
look back
at Blomkvist still handcuff on the floor and like a
child asking a parent for permission

may i kill he
nothing in he life would allow he to agree to such a
thing until now
now it be as if she year of violence
and degradation have be passed to he
he nod


she put the hunt knife in he hand
pull the gun
from she back pocket check the clip flick off the
safety and turn to leave

he have more gun in the den

i know
she come up the basement stairs leading with she gun
distant thunder rumble
she cross through the kitchen
to the live room and down the hall to the study
she
ease around the doorway the room be empty look to
the gun case see there be only two rifle there now
she hear an engine start outside
hurry back through
the house
see out the picture window the taillights of
martins car recede fast down the road as cloud burst
she bang out the front door
run halfway down the
hill in the rain to where she left she motorcycle jump
on and kickstarts it


she roar onto the bridge chasing the taillights
gun the bike to full throttle
come alongside he
he swerve to try to crush she against the railing
but she hit the brake avoiding the impact
she accelerate again and come up on the other side
of the car
he swerve again at she but this time the
bike pull ahead of he
now he be chasing she
he gain on she as they near the end of the bridge
as
they race off it he go in for the kill but she veer
hard to one side leaving he headed straight for the gas
station Blomkvist make he pay phone call from and
the tanker truck park there
martin hit the brake hydroplane into the truck and
it or he own tank or both explode
salander circle back
regard the fire engulf the
car
the rain do nothing to dampen it
she could
probably brave it to pull martin out but do not
as the flame burn he clothes he manage to get his
hand on the rifle he take from the den turn it barrel
to he bloody head but before he can pull the trigger
she hurry over yank it from he grasp and stand back
again
it be much more cathartic to watch he burn




she find Blomkvist in the live room
sitting in a
chair he coat wrapped around he
the hunt knife in
he hand
distant siren echo
he can still just
barely manage to speak

where be he

dead


reminiscent of the last photograph taken on the hedeby
island bridge forty year ago police and fireman finish
up at the crash site
winch drag martins charred
black wreck of a car onto a tow truck


Blomkvist be asleep in the bedroom with what look like

Blomkvist return to the van
climb in

how do it go

i think
he sit and watch they monitor the phone and computer
tap they install early
one of the laptop without
anyone touching it blink on to a Google screen

she be on
screen name and password character on a Gmail page
type themselves
they expect she to go to compose but
she open one of the message spam delete it mark
a couple more and banish they as well
the only new thing left in the inbox be an eBay alert
click it take she to an auction for a triplestrand
fauxpearl jackie necklace
pound
the cursor
click the BuyItNow button
as the screen switch to Anitas Paypal account
Blomkvist and salander exchange a confuse glance





Salanders laptop be monitor Anitas computer she
hardline phone and cell
Blomkvist emerge from the bathroom rest a hand on
Salanders shoulder to peer over it at the screen
in
one of the window card be dealing themselves

she be playing solitaire
and she still have not called anyone

no

do we have she cell too
salander point to one of the window on the screen
he hand come off she shoulder



i be so she would lead we to she

put you hand back on i shoulder
he do
they watch the solitaire game together

there be only one reason she
would not call harriet
she can not
because harriet be indeed dead


it be strange perhaps but he do some of he good
think during sex

i be just think
what if

ten more second
that be fair
she finish
they lie there
then

okay what

i be just think there could be
one other possibility





Blomkvist tap on Anitas open office door

may i

what be it now
he come in and sit

i want to show you something
he tug he shirt collar low enough to reveal the black
and blue tattoo around he neck
anita be taken aback
by the sight
it be hard to imagine how anyone would end
up with a mark like that



before he die you brother hung i
from a hook
harriet


they sit together on a park bench

anita married in stockholm in
it be recorded in the swedish general
register
but the family never know
do they
she confirm that with a
shake of she head
i be guessing she then come here on a
passport in she marry name and you
follow on she maiden name passport

actually it be the other way
around
she think it safe for i
to travel with spencer myself

what do he think about that

nothing
only that he loved she
she said if you love i you will do
this and not ask why
he never do

they both die twenty year ago

car accident
you find that too
Blomkvist nod reach for something in he jacket
pocket change he mind change it again and pull it
out

be this you
he hand she the less graphic of the two polaroid
salander find in martins basement the young girl
face turned halfaway from the camera

i be the first time he raped i

martin



no i father
he take this picture
martin do not start until he die
Blomkvist can not hide he horror even after all he be see

why do not you tell someone

i do
i mother
Blomkvist stare
finally

henrik would have do something

would he
i do not know
i almost
told he
but i be afraid because
of what i do
you still do not understand
he do not
she study he and perhaps see in he
what salander do long ago that he can be trusted

year after the first time
after many time during that year
i father get drunk than usual one
night and start brag about
woman he would killed
he quoted from
the bible as he tear off i clothes
he wrapped a belt around i neck
he
wanted to kill i


harriet make it out of the cabin in torn clthe
trying to get the belt around she neck off
she father
can hear inside rant something from the bible

i make it out of the house and down
to the dock
he come stagger
after i
gottfried emerge from the cabin and stumble down the
hill in pursuit of he almostnaked daughter

i could never fight he off in a
small room but i be strong enough
out in the open to deal with an old
drink


as he come onto the dock she wait for the moment and
smash he in the head with the flat side of an oar
it
stun and send he toppling off the dock into the water
he surface reach for the dock plank
as he take
hold of they to claw himself from the water she bring
the sharp edge of the oar down bury it in he head
like an axe
he stare up she uncomprehending
he finger slide
away from the dock
he body go limp and sink out of
sight beneath the water

when it be finally over i look
up and martin be standing there
she see she brother up by the cabin looking down at she

with a little smile



he drag i back to the cabin
all i would accomplished be substitute
one rapist for another


young harriet and she school friend walk along the
town main street past crowd lining it and we realize
we be seeing what we have only see in still photograph

couple month later henrik send
he off to school in uppsala
and i
think maybe maybe the nightmare
be over
until that day
the float with the harem girl come past and we watch
the smile on young harriets face change to fear as she
notice something off to the left

there he be across the street
looking at i with that same little
smile on he face
clear shot of young martin in he uppsala blazer
standing by the corner smile at she

it be not over





how do you get away
anita


anita frame in the bedroom window like in the
photograph look out at the activity on the bridge
behind she harriet pack a few item of clthe

do not take anything
harriet put the clothes back
pick up she purse

leave that too


the dinner that night
Vanger notice harriets empty
chair
and anita saying nothing taking a bite of food


the searcher scour the island
the boat moving
along the shoreline
the crane lifting the truck from
the bridge
anita climb into she car outside she father Haralds
house
drive down the road toward the bridge

stay absolutely still
the blanket covering harriet on the backseat floorboard
move slightly then be still
policeman on the island side of the bridge wave the
car across it
as it head along the mainland service
road toward the highway

she saved i


silence
then she gesture to Blomkvists neck

how do you get away

someone saved i too


he gesture off to the thin strange girl sitting on
another park bench too far away to hear they
harriet
do something she have not do since they meet
smile




Blomkvist salander and Frode wait in Vangers study

tea service tray sit there untouched like the first time
Blomkvist come here
anna push a wheelchair into the
room with Vanger in it
there be a file on he lap

Vanger propel he wheelchair down the main hall but
stop when he see harriet coming in the front door with

compare to when he last see she or maybe to convince
himself she be really alive
she see he

hi henrik
he begin to weep
she walk to he and place a hand
on he hunch shaking shoulder

sir

he flamboyant life in solitude and
anonymity locked behind the door of

perfect christmas card vista that actually turn out

merry christmas inside a personal note that be more
sincere than she think herself capable
she blow on the ink put the card in it envelope
neatly write mikael on it get up


snow falling but unlike the brutal winter storm last
year it be just heavy enough to dust the city in white
powder that reflect the christmas light in the tree
the beauty of she city please salander as she ride
through it on she motorcycle
or maybe it be something
she be feeling as she turn onto Blomkvists street
she park
gather the garment bag and card walk under
construction scaffolding toward he apartment build
from around the corner ahead Blomkvist and erika appear
he say something and she laugh put she arm around his
waist and lay she head against he neck scarf
salander stop midstride duck into an alcove under the
scaffolding wait as long as it should take they to get
inside the build then peer out again
they be not inside
they have stopped just outside the
build entrance
they be embracing
and the long
they stand there together the sharpe the pain stab at
salander
finally they separate but only to allow Blomkvist to
unlock the door
erika take he hand then and they
disappear inside


salander can not move
wait for the pain to subside
which it eventually do but only to be replace with a
sense of helplessness
then that subside replace with
a facade of insouciance
the rich girl in sweden emerge from the alcove and
walk back the way she come tossing the garment bag and
card into a construction dumpster climb onto she honda
start it and drive off
probably forever
