bulk to a sit

naive seriousness

i want to apologize for some of the
folk in town

i do not know
maybe diamond
maybe
gunpowder

no
nothing like that
we be a little
suspicious of stranger be all
hangover from the old day
the old
west

i think the tradition of the old
west be hospitality

i be trying to be hospitable mr
Macreedy
boyishly push his
dusty cap back on
he head
go to be around for a while

could be

how would you like to go hunt
tomorrow
i would be proud to have you
as i guest

thanks but i be afraid not

you mean because of you arm
slap Macreedys
shoulder in a
friendly
understand gesture
i know a man once lost an arm in a
thresh accident
used to hunt all
the time
but he be quite a man
he
pause
then with
discreet and charming
gravity
i be sorry
i
what i mean be if
there be anything i can do while you be
around

i be looking for
never mind
thanks anyway

you be looking for what mr
Macreedy

man named Komako

Komako sure i remember he
japanese farmer
never have a chance

no

he get here in just before
pearl harbor
three month later he
be ship to one of those relocation
center
tough

which one do he go to

who know

you think maybe if i write he the
letter would be forward

i be sure it would
write you letter
i will see it get out tonight

it would not be too much trouble

no trouble at all

funny
because i think it would be a
great deal of trouble for you
it be
be a great deal of trouble for i

i write these letter to Komako
they be not forward
they be
return address unknown
he smile grimly at
smith
so i guess there be nothing you can
do for i after all

need a little help

i can manage

well i need a little help
she look at he
questioningly
i would like to rent you jeep

it will be two dollar an hour gas
extra and ten dollar for i time

be not you going to ask he where he
want to go

he want to go to adobe flat

the road marked

yeah
it be about six seven mile
down

then i will not need you time

i think you might
need a little
help

i can manage

liz
do you have a license to rent
car
you could get into trouble

it be all right
i will not mention it
to the sheriff

you should not have do that

i think it would be good if he
go out there and get do with it
smith look at she
sharply
i mean what could he find out

this be liable to be the hard ten
dollar you ever earned in you life


after a beat
disinterestedly
what do he want the stranger

he ask about Komako
you think he will kick up a storm

storm
about what

i do not know
all i know i do not
want trouble around here
pause awkwardly
then
never again

trouble
you do not know anything
about Komako now do you tim

i do not
that be the point

the point be what you do not know
can not hurt you

maybe there be something i ought to
know
maybe i ought to ask you
before the stranger come back and
start breathing down i neck

tim you be a lose ball in the high
weed
i told you a long time ago
nothing happen for you to worry
about

stand up facing
smith
thing be i do worry
maybe i be not
much else but i be sure a worrier
beat then with soft
emphasis
and i be still the law

then do you job tim

what be i job mr
smith
maybe i would
well find out before Macreedy do
it for i

Macreedyll do nothing tim
and
neither will you

suppose i decide to try

that would be dangerous
you get the
body of a hippo tim but the brain
of a rabbit
do not overtax it

lowering he eye
mumble
yes mr
smith

from


yeah
from that private detective

what do he say
who be this guy

never hear of he that be what he
say
he checked and there be no john

Macreedy
no list no record
no information
nothing

quietly after a
beat to smith
where do that leave we

i will tell you where

shut up

now coley

i think Macreedys a nothing

nobody

be he

so there be nothing to worry about

be not there
you get brain you have

but what can he find out
that Komako
be
suppose he find out

nobody like Macreedy can raise a
pretty big stink
the point be
who would miss a nobody like Macreedy
if he just say disappeared
who
coley

coley

galvanized from the
rail
huh

why do not we wait

wait for what

i mean maybe he will not find anything
maybe he will just go away

not Macreedy
i know those maim
guy
they mind get twist
they
put on hair shirt and act like
martyr
they be all of they do
gooder trouble maker freak

but there be no danger yet
let we
wait and see

interrupt
appealing to coley
as an equal
no danger he say
this guy like
a carrier of small pox
since he
arrive there be be a fever in
this town an infection
and it be
spreading
he glance from coley
to pete
hastings have be in a sick sweat
running around shooting off he
face
doc for the first time in
four year get snotty with i
liz
you own sister act like a
fool

she be just a kid

kid
she must have strained every
muscle in she head to get so stupid
rent he a jeep
and tim tim
the rumdum
tim suddenly decide
he be get to act like a sheriff
to coley gesture
at pete
and he say what be the danger

of course if you want to take the
chance

not i

all right then

it be not all right
you be so mighty
quick to kill he be not an animal

to coley with mock
surprise
well listen to little spitfire
turning slowly on
pete
you sniveling toad
i be saving you
neck
if i do not who will

all i said

who will
doc
tim
you sister
with the rock in she head

one thing about you sister she be
get twice the guts you have
you be
only fit for running away

it be too late for that
belligerently slowly
at pete
he be in this and he be not running
no place

all right then

let smith find himself a new boy
i
can not take it another day
if you be a sheriff they get to
respect you otherwise you can not do
you job
they just laugh

i do not laugh tim

why do not you

cut it out tim

you should

in the name of welladjusted manhood
snap out of it
you be going to get
a complex or something

four year ago if i would of do i
job
if i would of check up and find
out what happen
but i do not
just like smith figure

what could you have find out
they
told you a story
you have to believe
it

do you believe it

do you know what happen

i do not know
i lead a quiet contemplative life

i i do not even try to find out
do not you understand
he tap the badge on
he chest
when you wear that badge you be the
law
and when something happen
against the law you be suppose to
do something about it
it be you
job
i
i do nothing
and that be what be
eatin i
what kind of prescription
you get for that

i do not know
i have never be able
to find one for myself

only one thing do not quit tim

why not

maybe this feller Macreedy have the
prescription


well if it be not Macreedy the
world champion road hog

yeah
it be a small world

but such an unfriendly one
now why
do you want to crowd i off the
road

i be kind of sorry if i have incur
you displeasure

look what you do to i car

if there be anything i can do to make
up for it

you ought to be careful man all
that onearm drive

i would be glad to pay the damage

it be a threat to life and limb

fortunately no one be hurt

you could get yourself killed that
way nosine all over the
countryside

that be the real danger i can see
that

why that be pretty smart of you
how
long you intend to keep it up

reasonably as
Macreedy turn toward
he
i would like to ask you a few question

wryness

i would not want to see that
girl get into trouble

you would not

what with rental permit gas

i admire you sturdy sense of
responsibility

future

i hear you handle a jeep real well

i have a way with jeep
certain
familiarity

i think i understand
you be an army
man
looking at Macreedys
stiff arm
where do you get it

italy

i tried to get in myself the
day after those rat bombed pearl
harbor

first man in line at marine recruit

i believe a man be as big as
what he seek
i believe you be a
big man mr
Macreedy

why would a man like you be looking
for a lousy jap farmer

at Macreedy
i believe that a man be as big as

smith

i
nothing in particular

after the sneak
attack on pearl harbor

loyal JapaneseAmericans that be a
laugh
they be mad dog
look at
corregidor the death march

what do Komako have to do with
corregidor

be not he a jap
look Macreedy
there be a law in this county against
shoot dog
but if i see a mad
dog loose i do not wait for he to
bite i
exhale sharply
shaking he head
with irritation
i swear you be beginning to make i
mad

all stranger do

not all
some of they
when they come
here snooping

snoop for what

i mean outsider coming around
looking for something

for what

i do not know
people be always
looking for something in this part
of the west
to the historian it be
the old west
to the book writer
it be the wild west
to the
businessman it be the undeveloped
west
they all say we be backward
and poor and i guess we be
we do not even have enough water
but this place to we be we west
i just wish they would leave we alone

leave you alone to do what

i do not know what you mean

what happen to Komako

he go away i told you
shortly
after he left a bunch of kid get
fooling around out he place
they
burned it down
it be one of those
thing you know how kid be

what be funny

nothing
only i do not believe
you
any more than i believe you
about the letter

you do not seem to believe anything i
say

yes i do about businessman for
instance
i think a businessman would
be interest in adobe flat

why

all that land lying fallow
could be
put to some use
like a graveyard
smith open he mouth
to speak but Macreedy
go on
historian might be interest
too
because of the strange custom
around here such as bury cattle

bury cattle

something bury out there

see these wild flower
that mean a
grave
i have see it overseas
i figure
it be not a mane grave or someone
would have marked it
sort of a
mystery be not it

sort of
maybe you can figure it
out

maybe

why not give it a whirl
it will help you pass the time
continue
meaningfully
for a while

not interest
i get other thing
to do

hi
pull up a chair

can i use you phone

help yourself

who be ever be back here i can say
that to

it be

what be

if i have get you peg and i think
i have you be calling the state
police
but if i be you and i be
purely glad i be not i would look it
up myself
i would not trust anybody around here
including i

thanks




line be busy
he click off the
instrument

i know do not tell i line all
busy
they will be busy all day

after a beat
grimace
do not look at i like that

like what

like i be a potential customer

everybody be and i get they coming
and going

first i sell they a piece of land
think they farm it
nope
they dig
for gold

they rip off the top soil of ten
wind hill
they sprint in here
fogheaved with excitement lugging
nugget big and bright and shiny

be it gold

it be not
do they quit
they do
not

with theatrical
gesture toward
reproduction
then they decide to farm
farm
in
country so dry you have to prime a
man before he can spit and before
you can say fat sam they be stall
strand and starve
they get weevil
brain and buttsprung

so i bury they
a beat as he rejoin
Macreedy in the center
of the room
but why should i bore you with i
triumph

yeah
i have get a problem of i own

like an old testament
prophet
they be going to kill you with no
hard feeling

and you will just sit on you hand
and let they

do not get waspish with i young
feller

sorry

i feel for you but i be consume
with apathy
why should i mix in

to save a life

i get enough trouble saving i own
he refill he glass
from a milk bottle
on the desk
i try to live right and drink i
orange juice every day
but mostly i
try to mind i own business
which
be something i would advise you to do

it be a little late for that

you can still get out of town
and
you would well get out like a whisper

how can i

taking a key ring
from he pocket
i get sort of a limousine at you
disposal

where be it

out back

concentrate on the
dashboard
will not start

something wrong

just will not start

could be the wirin
why do not you
look under the hood

for that i thank you
how much time you think i have get
before

they will wait at least till dark
they would be afraid to see each other
face

slap doc
shoulder lightly
well so long doc
i can not say it be
be charming but

where be you going

i do not know
but i be going on foot

that be no good
you stray ten yard
off main street and you will be stone
cold dead
offer Macreedy a
cigarette
that be the situation in a nut

it be the wirin like i said
now
be not that a good guess

it can be fixed

easy
unless of course this here
wire
reaching inside the
hood pointing
get broke or something

suddenly heatedly
turning on hector
do the nice little thing like keep
you big fat nose out of i business

triumphantly holding
up the wire
yep
it be the wirin

i be sorry son
you get to admit i
tried

maybe

maybe what

if i can not get out of town maybe i
can get the state cop in

you tried the phone do not you
you
know what happen do not you

there be another way
i will be seeing

i hope you will be seeing i


you notifyin the state police

putting a bill on
the counter
that be what it say

lemonade

it be hot as Billybedurned

do not you like lemonade

i never think much about it

it do not have the muzzle velocity of
some other drink drunk around here
but it be good for what ail you

what ail you mr
hastings

i

why be you so upset about
this wire

i

be you afraid mr
hastings

i
i guess i be
awkwardly he put
Macreedys bill back
on the counter
but what be the use talkin
you do not know what it be like be
scare

you want i to describe the symptom
right this minute i be scare half to
death

you should be

yeah
but not of the state police

neither be i

then what be you afraid of
the
grave at adobe flat
grave nobody
mark nobody know anything about

that be not it either

be it smith
be it

look mr
Macreedy
i be just a good
neighbor

to smith you be
how about to Komako

meet Macreedys
eye
i never see Komako in i life
honest

again push the
bill toward hastings
then send that wire and bring i
the answer
you will do that will not
you

pause then worriedly
picking up the bill
yes sir


i tell you i will not have anything to
do with it

live and let live that be what i
say

i do not know
i just do not know

you going to brood about it
or you
want another beer

beer i guess
only

what will you have

what have you get

chili wite bean

anything else

chili wit bean

you do not like the taste that be
what they make ketchup for

in that case i will have it
and a
cup of coffee

to Macreedy with
menace friendliness
you still around
i think you do not
like this place

go to or coming from

staying put

no comment

to smith gesture
a thumb toward
Macreedy
no comment he say
no comment and
all the time he be get i chair

i always seem to be taking somebody
place around here

this seat be not comfortable

i be afraid of that

i think i would like the seat you be on

he be as changeable as a prairie fire

suppose you tell i where to sit

i hope that be not too much

to smith gesture
toward coley
you friend a very
fellow

sort of unpredictable too
get a
temper like a rattlesnake

that be i all over
i be half hoss
half alligator
mess with i i will
kick a lung outta you
what do you
think of that

no comment

talking to you be like pulling tooth
you wear i out
you be a yellowbellied jap lover
be i right or wrong

you be not only wrong you be wrong
at the top of you voice

you do not like i voice

again turning to
smith
i think you friend trying to start
something

now whyever would he want to do
that

i do not know
maybe he figure needle
i enough and i will crack
maybe i will
even fight back
then he or hector
you other ape would beat i to
death and cop a plea of selfdefense

i do not think that be necessary
you be so scare now you will probably
drown in you own sweat

before that happen could not i pick
a fight with you if i tied one hand
behind i

if i tied both hand

would not it be easy if you just
wait till i turned i back
looking toward the
loafer at the bar
then back at smith
or be there too many witness
present

with effortless
ferocity
you be still in trouble

so be you
whatever happen you be lost

you get thing a bit twisted

you killed Komako
sooner or later
you will go up for it
not because you
killed he in this town you
probably could have get away with
it but because you do not even
have the guts to do it alone
you
put you trust in guy like he
gesture toward the
unconscious coley
and hector they be not the
most dependable of god creature
sooner or later they will get the idea
you be playing they for sap
what will
you do then peel they off one by
one
and in the meantime if any one
of they break you will go down hard
because they get something on you
something to use when thing get
tough

and they be get tough every
minute

man
manohman


anything for i

nothing

any message a telegram

returning to his
card
nothing

to Macreedy shrilly
gruffly
in case you be interest Coleyll
live
glaring at smith and
hector
i be truly sorry to say

to doc jerking a
fat hand toward
Macreedy
you friend pretty tough

yeah
he be wicked
he defend himself
when he be attack

well
you going to just sit here
and let time run out

i be waiting for a wire
from the
state cop

you send it through hastings
just do not expect an answer if that be
the way you send it

looking toward the
door
no

i think that be for i
he take the message
from smiths hand
and quickly glance
at it
look up at
hastings
where be the answer

you expect an answer to a wire
that be never send

what be so funny

nothing
just a thought
he eye turn to
hastings
hastings
wilt
a thought dazzle in it purity

you be in a jam hastings
you give
i telegram to smith

you warty wretch
that be a federal
offense

you be in deep too
like i said it be get tough
and tough
sheriff you would well do something
about this

i reckon that be right mr
smith

do not be a jerk tim

divulging information there be a
law

tim you be pathetic

could be
but i be still sheriff

that be the point
you be not sheriff
any more
you just lost a job you be
so pathetic

all right sheriff
take over

you can not do that

can not i
i put he in office
now i
take he out

now
you want to register a complaint

to register a complaint boy you have
get to have evidence
you get
evidence

you get a big mouth boy makin
accusation disturbin the peace
there be law in this county protectin
innocent folk from big mouth
why
i would just hate to

hector
come on hector

it be all right tim
we be not lick
yet

be not we
i be

there come a time tim when a mane
just get to do something

not i
i be useless and i know it

no man be useless if he be get a
friend

i be you friend tim

then let i alone

jab at Macreedy
with a thumb
he be going to need you before the
night be over

and all the useful man be on the
other side

lemme alone i tell you

i can not let you alone
i can not let
myself alone
do not you understand
that
he turn from tim to
pete who be unable
to shake he gaze
then sadly fiercely
four year ago something terrible
happen here
we do nothing about
it
nothing
the whole town fell
into a sort of settle melancholy
and the people in it closed they
eye and held they tongue and failed
the test with a whimper

now something terrible be going to
happen again and in a way we be
lucky because we have be given a
second chance
and this time i will not
close i eye i will not hold i tongue
and if i be needed i will not fail
almost harshly again
facing tim
and neither will you

i get such a headache i be bewilder
i hurt all over

i know
unconsciously he
right arm stray to
massage the paralyzed
left
pain be bewildering
i come here
bewilder full of selfpity afraid
to fight back
gesture with his
hand to pete
and then you friend smith tried to
kill i
the muscle around
Petes mouth tighten
funny how a man cling to the earth
when he feel there be a chance he
may never see it again

there be a difference between clinging
to the earth
eye tim almost
contemptuously
and crawling on it
you going to
stand by and watch forever

i be not going to watch and i be not
going to get into it either

i be gettin out
i be sorry mr
Macreedy

you would be smart to get out too

angrily turning to
pete
there be too many smart guy around
here
i be glad i be a dummy

you be a troublesome dummy
you be
liable to end up on you own slab

i expect to be in a lot more trouble
before i die

go home doc
he jerk he head
toward Macreedy and
with mock bravado

he be all washed up

grinning harshly at
he
you think so

i be washed up when i get off that
train

you shouldna of get off

have to
i have one last duty to perform
before i resigned from the human
race

i think you be going to los
angeles that hotbed of pomp and
vanity
be that resign from the
human race



s a good jumping off place
for the islands for mexico central
america

why

i do not know
i be looking for a
place to get lose i guess

why

slapping he paralyzed
arm with the whisky
bottle
because of this
i think i would never
be able to function again
thanks to you friend smith i find
i be wrong

sure
you be a man of action

i know you problem
you would like i to die quickly without
wasting too much of you time
pete open he mouth
to say something
but Macreedy press
on
or silently without making you
feel too uncomfortable
or
thankfully without making you
memory of the occasion too
unpleasant

i memory be so pleasant as it
be

quietly pressing he
advantage
what happen pete

be you going to tell he or you
want i to
smith own adobe flat
he leased it
to Komako think he have cheated
he think Komako could never even
run stock without water
there be
never any water on adobe flat
Komako
dig a well by hand
he must have
go down one hundred and fifty foot

he get water plenty
smith be pretty
sore
he do not like jap anyway

that be an understatement

the day after pearl harbor smith
go to sand city

i know
to enlist
he be turn
down

he be sore when he get back
about
ten of the clock he start drink

yeah
hector joined he and coley
then sam and about nine p
m
i
we be all drink patriotic drunk
we go out to Komakos for a little
fun i guess scare he a little

do you know he

we would see he around some but none
of we know he
when he hear we
coming he locked the door
smith
start a fire
the jap come running
out
he clothes be burn

Macreedy

joe Komako die in italy saving i
life
they give he a medal
i come
here to give it to he father

god forgive i

to pete harshly
guttural
it will take a lot of whiskey to wash
out you guts

and it will never help not
even a barrel full wash away murder

but maybe i be wrong
go on drink
what else be left for you
you be as dead as Komako only you
do not know it
you also do not know that it be not
enough to feel guilty
it be not enough
to confess
it be not enough to say
forgive i i have do wrong


take it easy Macreedy
sit down

sit down
or would you rather have
i kneel to beg he pardon for
raising a touchy subject

you do not have to remind i
i have
never forgotten

well that be mighty noble of you
you feel ashamed that be noble
too
and four year from now you will
probably be sitting here telling
somebody else you have not forgotten
i
that be progress you will still
be ashamed but i will be dead

go on have you drink

leaning over counter
stare at he

whatever you do to hector you do not
do it with brain
how do you get
pete to change he mind

not with muscle

and not with brain either
he be a
pushover for a muscle man

i be beginning to think it run in
the family

of a mane shoulder

i would sure have like to see you tangle
with reno smith
