
screenplay by
howard franklin



wow
that be hard
i would have to say
it be the day we launch outpost


it be the beverage

gary always make sure we have get the
cool stuff to drink

knowing you work mean something



knowing everywhere in the world
this be the software people use



year ago gary have an idea that be
all he have
and now the company
big than



it be the people
which be weird

big company be pose to be
impersonal



there be this myth that do a start
up be cool
but there be no community
with a startup
no permanence

it bum i out when the media say
we be cultish or whatever
why
because we care about each other

love you too bro

i will tell you what be not cool

how gary get this superbad rap



there be this prejudice against super
smart people
people like gary

kid working in he garage can create
the next outpost the new
all
it take be a great idea

that be why nobody can have a monopoly
in a business build on idea



the cool
gary
he be like you or
i
if we happen tobe insanely
rich

can we go

for i
it be seattle

starting to get nauseate

do you mind

do anybody mention the beverage

be it over

they still have to give they
refreshment lace with mindaltering
drug

you be a fanatic

agoing to wait outside



alice
you get to make he do the
startup with teddy and i

make he

you know what i mean



i be not exactly worldly but i be the
secretary of state next to he



and they be all throwing this
stuff at he
stock option
pay
package

i be just screw

you know what he be like
he just
want to work on stuff that be cool

you do not want to move do you

i can paint anywhere

i would like to stay here yeah
and i
kind of think he should be with teddy



i mean nobody else can follow what
they be talking about half the time

could be a conditionvariable in
the lock code if it do not seg
fault first

maybe you should not push it so hard
about outpost
no offense you sound
insane

i can not help it
i feel like they would
do anything to keep they

anything
that be not even credible
if he want to go up there
to check
it out
i think you should encourage
he
seeing Larrys
incredulity
it be he life
but everybody
treat he like this valuable
object
you be hurting you own case

he be i god
i hear he actually call
recruit sometimes
or be that an
urban legend

Garys running the big software
company in the world brian
he be
be harrass by the justice
department and he be get a new baby

milo
i be danny

oh hi

gary would like to speak to you

hello

milo
gary boyd
i be hope you and
you friend can come up here
we have
make some amazing stride in digital
convergence
i would love to show they
to you

you would
wow
when would we come
he wait
he look
up
think he hung up

but how do he know that be what you
guy working on

all the company know
the faculty
tell they
at the target school

in exchange for endowment
they
should just drop the pretense and
name the school after they

i can not believe you refused a ticket

i parent already freakedout
i be staying here
mile from
chinatown

well maybe if you told they how much
money you would be making
you be going up there
right

i think you should go

you do

i mean it be you life

i think i kind of lost it
i be
just so thril to be talking to
the rich most powerful
do not
know i even care about that stuff

mon how often do you talk to
somebody who be be on the cover of
time
three of four time

lot of what larry say be true
they just clone stuff or reverse
engineer it and everybody get stick
with they inferior version because
they

then you have get to ask he about that

it be important

if he be really a bully he will not cop
to it anyway

bully
be we talking about gary
boyd
or you dad

when i be a kid
and he be moving
we all over the place
i spent all
i time writing stuff on outpost


i think gary boyd be the
great

but he be not quite the same guy
anymore
do not get you hope too
high

could not convince teddy to come

he be pretty tight with he family

we could move they up here

he just like to write code
he be
bum there be so much secrecy and
competition everybody trying to own
everything

who do you mean by everybody


so how far be we from the campus

oh we be not going to the campus

who be that

i think they call he the houseman

because guard sound too weird

do not be nervous
the house be the
weirde thing about he

it be like he know everybody expect
he to be this worldly colorful
zillionaire
but he be just a guy who
like software

have a seat
he will not be long

we tried the big vaporware number
gary it be nosale

can we buy into they
or be
that a justice dept
problem

there be no public offer
the guy
who write it joined some freakazoid
cult in san luis Obispo
write this
just to run they web site

milo
excuse the tie
i be on

that be okay

the house know the painting i like
it know i favorite music
same for
anybody else who be in the system

cool

would you like a coke or something

oh
no thank

when we start i just hired i
smart friend
that be great
we
get a little big i have to hire
smart stranger
much harder

now i do not get to hire anybody
but
i know you be the guy to write
Skywire

you know a lot about art i guess

there be a rumor going around maybe
you have hear it

there be more to life than computer
i be looking into it

once i start looking into something

i have only show this to three other
people
i buy we have launch
so far
i keep the coordinate in
this room
as milo take it
carefully
it be left over from
reagans
star war technology
they orbit
mile up

low enough to relay internet traffic

he smile
exactly
among other thing
we know
convergence be the real superhighway
all the pc tvs phone etc
linked together
why cram it into a
cable if you can use the whole sky

turning the sleek
object
Skywire

the content filer have tobe written
into the media file so bit coming
off the satellite can be read by
multiplatforms
really omniplatforms
including whatever new hardware
emerge

it need a more objectoriented
language
this do not scale do
it

you would have to start practically from
scratch
but this be all you would be
working on
no markete meeting
no product seminar
we can not waste
the time
half the valley working
on convergence
sore media
conglomerate cable company phone
company
can not finish second
milo
there be no second
now what
would you like to ask i

ask you

i know what people say and not just
the justice department
we clone
idea inflict we secondrate
version on the world we have not
do anything original since


do i think that be fair
no
i would put
some of we app up against anybodies
but be there some truth to it

when you get to a certain age you
start wonder
about you legacy
i doubt you even remember outpost



i do

yeah
i want to feel like i do when i
write that
but i be that be
in cyberyears
i look at you and
see the thing that get i here
but somehow get away

if i dad leveled with i like
that even once
the weird thing
be i fantasy he could somehow be
like the old gary
it be he fantasy
too

i think that be great milo
i do

but

do not you visit the campus

i forget
that be why you have to
help i decide

no way
you have this destiny

mon i would not have a destiny
without you
i destiny would be
dying at
from eat

do not bring that up
like a different
girlfriend would let you die

you saved i life in alot of way

it be not just gary that make you
want to go there
because it be a big
place
you might not even see he
again

i know

when be brian coming for the

Probly waiting by the phone for
outpost to call
we will leave it for
he

give you guy some time alone

you get i email

and you phone message
you want to
do what you do it be not a crime

be that how larry feel

uh
not exactly

want to say goodbye to he

hey we get seed money for the
startup
millionfive

we rent a loft in sunnyvale
he give milo the
number
you know what be the bad part
we
can not talk about work anymore
we be
competitor
the venture capitalist
make we sign like confidentiality
form

outpost make i sign
guess
we will find out what else we have to
talk about
life stuff

guess what
they get they

milo this be mr
barton from the
justice department
give barton the
water
sorry about the glass

do not worry milo
i be here as a
friend
or maybe a supplicant

right
what be that mean again

beggar
we be at a disadvantage with
outpost
we expert be not as smart
as theirs
sometimes we can not tell
which technology pose the threat
of a monopoly
we need a really smart
guy to help we pick we fight
i be
taking a shot in the dark here
i
can offer you a year a buick
i be hope you have get a feel it be
the right thing to do

fiddling with the
card
it be just i kind of feel the need
to do something with i ability
create something

like i said
shoot in the dark

if you see something there that rub
you the wrong way
do the right thing

that take some fun out of

we be not going to let it

ingest the fatal mixture of
sedative crushed in apple sauce
accord to the cult eerily
professional website it be time
to move on


Therere building i mean not
counting the gym the day care
etc

Garys put millions in there
and
the people with kid
they be not
hotshot geek they be just payroll
clerk or whatever

you will see alot of that
department
of justice goon snooping around

so how do you like the house

he Snapples be in alphabetical
order

well he micromanaged the company
till it get too big
guess he need to micromanage
something

milo i be judith
welcome

everybody have the same office there be
no dumbass corporate hierarchy

get out while you can dude

desi milo

the guy who be at Garys house

good bomb shelter in america
accessible from every build
you
get to figure we be a major target
right

whoa
lisa actually look at you

every geek here get a thing for
lisa
but that be about the big
reaction she be have to anybody

shy changing the
emphasis
she be a programmer

heavy graphical background do
designinterface for Skywire app
you will be working with she

i have get a girlfriend remember

right
that be rare around here
you
know how nun remarry to jesus
Posties be marry to outpost

here you world
copy of Garys book also the audio
version narrate by gary

the card encoded
tell we who
come through the door and when

unauthorized entry sound like this

if you see a tailgater report he

Tailgater

somebody coming in on you swipe
give milo a photo

you see somebody wandering around
without it be you duty to
challenge he
i do not give a shit
if you be a stockoption billionaire
if you do not challenge i will have
you butt

he seem a little tense

geek pull he chain because he be non
tech
Excop or something
they moon
camera or use atm as swipe card
the camera we real security so
he be a little demoralized

what be they building


way behind schedule
it be top
secret but everybody know it be a
digital broadcast space
they see
the dish on top the fiber optics
going in

Garys not into fiber optics
he be
betting everything on the satellite

you want to survive in the software
business you cover you bet
i
get to say this be the weirde car
anybody ever requested

oh right
you girlfriend an
artist

i phone she at you hotel told she
about we corporate house option
she sound neat

she be
turning away from
lisa
she be

might be some friction on the
domestic front
you be expected you
to put in ridiculous hour
Peopleve
accused we of breaking up
relationship to get they undivided
attention

you counselor fill you in on
everything else
that be who you will
be working with almost daily

busy

no
just waiting for i counselor to
come by and introduce himself

okay
i be gary

think i should buy some original

do i

somebody said i be just another
philistine
with reproduction

that be insane
you be ahead of you
time

that be what i told she
i wife

think i will be less of a control
freak if i have a hobby
just give
i something else to obsess about

anything we can salvage from the old
code before you start fresh

uh might be one or two thing


he be be in there like an hour

shit

could work with a new switch
there
may be a few more thing hidden

do not spend too much time searching
you ever vet somebody old code
before
when milo shake his
head
it be a different skill
stay close
to the surface
the besthidden
secret be in plain sight
you know
the good place to hide a leaf right
when milo shake his
head
in a tree

the corporate condo be as
romantic as they sound

you know he be never be anybodies
counselor before

milo
what about

oh it be great
it be great
they start to kiss
but

think i should tell he i learned
everything use

maybe i could
show he one of i early program

Infoteks urgent need to license
outpost office be such that we can
use it as a tool in the current
negotiation

when you write the word tool what
you mean by it

i do not remember

what you think you mean by it

i be confuse
be i suppose to
speculate under oath

since you do not have an answer to
that question mr
boyd

do not i
have an answer
i do not
remember


do you want to take a break mr
boyd

you protegees moving so fast we can
barely keep up with he

this be good
who do it

startup not mile from here
kid on prozac

maybe we should all get on it

how be it going

maybe i be going too fast

sharply
incredulous
too fast
at least four company
on the verge of workable convergence
system milo they

even when i have a hand in every aspect
of the company i know the one thing
you can never control be somebody
creative process

it be okay
really

reaching into his
pocket
take a look at this
slightly
different approach

you do this overnight

you be making i young again

graduate of he be on the
antidepressant prozac and have be
warn not to drink and drive
etc


milo

lisa

you know i name

you know mine

you be famous around here

i be get a teacher pet rep

i would not worry about it
you have
get to figure most people around here
be they teacher pet

be you

we moved around so much i barely
know i teacher

i too
be you an army brat or
something

something like that
yeah

do not mean to pry
i just have this
theory
some of we who get to good
at this
we be escaping
something

do i say something

no i know what you mean
i used to
spend i life wish people could
be like computer
least they make
sense
sometimes you think they have
betrayed you
like a person would
but then you see no you just missed
a step
you can go back and make it
all work

i used to wish that
all the time

re
the
what have you get there

graphical interface
for Skywire
i be pose to coordinate with you

show i

cool

yeah
i run it for lots of platform
ranging from the narrow bandwidth
to

ShShow i the next one

have a seat
he be with someone but
i know he want to see you

because we bundled it the judge be
threatening to enjoin the whole

i be confuse ted

do not you tell i they would be chapter
by the time they could hope to
enjoin
i be very confuse because
you said they would be ready to settle

go on in
when milo look
dubious
he be always happy to see you

milo
what be up

well you send for i

right
right

you really write this just today

what be you imply

nothing

everything i do be under scrutiny
the question they ask trying to
make anything strategic look sordid
i be confuse
do not everybody in
business try to get ahead

i be sure

the purpose of this company be not to
destroy we competitor any more
than the purpose of live be to
breath
but the software business be
binary
you be a zero or a one
being
obsessive be not a crime
it be a
character trait

it scale do not you think

definitely

this feel fairly grow up i would say

to we new life
what be wrong

that be what i need to ask you
you know you can not keep anything
from i

he give i some new codefixes this
morning
i said do you really do
this just today
because i be
impress
he said what be you
imply


it be the way he said it
just the
way i dad do when he be catch
in a lie
that be how you know you
be onto something ugly

what would it mean anyway
if he
do not write it

that be what i be asking myself
do
he have some genius stow away
why
not let he write Skywire
not saying it make sense

milo

i be so stupid

he be you boss
he be not you

i know i know

if you can not deal with he on that
basis you well get a new counselor

be not that extreme

what be extreme be what that doctor
said when he pumped you stomach
eat another sesame seed and that be
it

i mean if one little comment from
gary be going to upset you this much

you be right
it be a work
relationship
do not know what i be
expect

mon
let we do the toast

do you want to be alone

no
please

they just push up the schedule on
Skywire app
how fast be you going

there be no second place
plus
every time i get jammedup gary have
an inspiration
be it like that with you counselor

mine not the
he barely
remember to take a shower

right right
but do he ever just
like hand you code

maybe once
i rewrote it anyway

you be compulsive

Mmmmore like i have a little
trouble
trusting people

why be that

long story
not that interesting

so when you be talking about
wish people be more like
computer
be that then
or now

then and now
but not right now

milo

just drop off a resume
almost
get in the front door

you be living here

think if i relocate it could
help i case
i be writing program
for the local public access station
where any whackjob with buck
get he own show

give he a business
card

thank you for seeing i

have a seat

what seem to be the problem
you
look a little upset

i be
i be sir

milo

i friend i good friend teddy
be killed in silicon valley

i goodness

it be racially motivated
he be
chinese
he be
and
i know
sometimes the get involve with
that
do not they

if there be a civil right violation
but generally we let the local police
and do they work first

i just want to help bring these
guy to justice
they be neoNazis

let i look into it see what be be
do
frankly it be not i area

just do not know who else to talk
to

circle an arm over
milo
and outpost
you be happy there

yes sir

do not mention he be going to the
justice department

no

not like he be it
to do a thing
like that without telling you
you be
not losing you hold on he be
you

he will tell i when he get home

Thatll be a test will not it

instead of bust i chop you should
do something about that girl
fire
she
or something

Lisas an extremely valuable member
of the Skywire team
we have get we
eye on she
you keep yours on milo

prick

it be almost nine i have be so
worry
what do you see in there

nothing

nothing

it be what they said it be
an
unfinished broadcast studio
you
be right
i just drive to seattle
and back

why

remember lyle barton

the justice department guy who come
to the apartment when

i remember

after i broke into which be
insane thank god they do not catch
i
i just drive around
trying
to figure out what possessed i
you
know what
i have be putting i own
guilt on gary

guilt

if i would stay down there maybe this
would not have happen

poor baby
you know that be not true

i think instead of indulge all
these paranoid delusion risking i
job alienating gary scaring you i
should do something useful with i
grief
help they find Teddys killer

i be so worry about you

be such a long night

that be different

different

you do not feel it
so intense

so you be not avoiding i

what be wrong

i snuck into

why would you do a thing like

you think about it too
you have
be suspicious for a while
but
it be not happening in there
it be
happening in the day care

the day care

can we go someplace else

it be easy to know who the smart geek
be the school tell they
they upload
medical file school record
pharmacy file
they would be happy just
to steal code forever
but when a
program get close to fruition
like
teddy
he be almost there

but why would they

you know
there be no second place
and what be the risk
the killing
undetectable they be handtailored
they make sense
i mean they be
in the information business
they
have scenario for all of we too
in case we find out too much

i be not one of they
not trying to
suss you out


they killed i good friend
i be living
with somebody they pay to go to bed
with i
can not you trust somebody
just once
i do not want to be alone
here

i be sorry milo
i be sorry

i know why you be so secretive
why
you will not let anybody near you
i know what he do to you

oh yeah

so that be in i file

be that i scenario
tell i

they would frame he

he be out of prison

they be already watch you
if
they have to they would give he this
drug that mimic an alcoholic
blackout
he would wake up not even
remembering he act of revenge


no

Nobodys going to hurt you

milo

hmm

i always feel if a boy i liked
ever find out he would run
he would
think i be unclean

no no
never

all he suspicion be allay

you be sure

he said it make sense that Garys
code be like Teddys that that
cliche about great mind be true
say it be all about he own guilt
plus he have a tendency to get gary
mixedup with he dad once in a while
it always pass

he be not acting

i do not think he know how

what about the

they have get this guy in the
maybe other
we tell the wrong
person it be over

who can we trust

there be always a logical answer
you just have to define the question

how do you let go of a secret without
telling the wrong person

we do not tell anybody
we tell everybody
at once
so there be
no secret left to protect
when
everybody know they do not dare
touch we

no tony can not fill in for you he be
not at you authorization level

bob
you well look at this

do we post it on the net

Therere so many disinformation site
about gary already
where he have
devil horn or they crop he in
with saddam hussein

could it be a glitch
something the
construction worker cause

unlikely
all camera be frozen
do we call randy and phil
tell they
there may have be a breakin

not yet
love to bust i ass because
i be not in frig mensa
i swear to god it be that kid milo
i told they so in the first place
but they do not even want to hear about
it
let we run a printout on card entry

the mainstream media
or a
newsmagazine

right
but Garys tiedin to a lot
of media conglomerate
have to be
careful who we pick

we could crossreference a data base
on media ownership
but not on we
own computer
not even at home

certainly not at i happy home


gary hi

you look a little tire

i be okay
it be going well

have a look

sure

why do you move around so much
when you be a kid

i dad be a compulsive gambler
only he do not think he be
that
applied to guy who do not have a
system
loser who play game
of chance
he could read people
so chance have nothing to do with it
no matter how deep a hole he dig
himself he would give you the whole
speech
and you would well not point
out the obvious
he creditor would catch up to he
loan shark or whatever
he would wake
we in the middle of the night
off
we would go again

what would you tell the kid
at
you new school
you have to come up
with a good story right

no
i just go deeper into the
machine
preferred be the geek to
have to explain
lying would have
be bad

badly

because he be a liar
and i hated
he
get you head out of that machine
wise up to the real world
the more
he mock i the deep i go
because
if be savvy mean be like he
guess that be why i be kind of clueless
even now
do not cultivate i
connive side
not sure i even
have one

do not be so hard on yourself
with a
brain like yours you could connive
with the good of they i bet

he be buying up pretty much everything
cable company baby bell picture
library museum right film
archive
get ready for Skywire

what about minute


yeah they dig stuff like this
news have partner with outpost
information system in a cable news
network due to launch fall of


but still you can not say would not
love to break something like

he be shaking his
head
say there be just one mole work
there like barton at the
how
do we know he be not the guy we have
contact
or she
or the guy she
work for

time

TimeWarner have a per cent stake
in Garys settop device
that also
take out
join outpost in new venture
which mean be out
disney join
outpost be out
outpost and
Newscorp in new deal fox be out
any of these place could have a
mole
or all of they
it be like a a continuous loop
we
can go to some alternative press
place that people read get
they and we killed
but anything big
enough for this be a parent of or a
subsidiary to something Garys get a
finger in

shhh

sorry

milo

how close be you

what

he be get satellite up
he be get
dish on top of
he be building
this
meganetwork for Skywire
let we use
it

we can not just assume they be standing
by to receive Skywire month from
launch
i would have to write in an aglet

what

it be how online service push logo
they want to sell you
you do not ask
for they they just appear
have to
work on it somewhere besides i office
or i house
and then the quality of
the broadcast would not exactly be
digital that be month away

but they would still get the idea right

you would have to design a graphic
interface to make the data pop
maybe
some audio too
to tie it all in to
gary
how long would that take you

it be a standard
once i have get a
concept it be maybe three day work

gary know i be close on Skywire
we
have to do this fast

before they kill somebody else too

oh man
i would have to get into Garys
house
to get the satellite position

you mean break in

i do not know

and what if the broadcast dish on
top of be not hot yet
you said
the place be not finished

i will go look
they will just have a few more picture
of i snooping around

why be you so careless

i think the bad they would do be
fire i
who know they take
termination so literally

why be you snooping in i office

oh
i liked you
i be checking you out



think everybody in this place be
here the same reason we be



because they apartment might be
bug

i told teddy about you

Whatd he say

beautiful geek
what be the
chance


i feel guilty
because i owe so
much to alice
but even then i be
starting to wonder
be it so great
to be so consume by this one thing
that you let another person do you
think for you
if you have a
lucrative skill it be all anybody
want from you
you grow old but
you do not grow up
you turn into
into

gary

larry used to say how the guy who
write the first cool operate
system like the guy at
berkeley
they just give it away
they figure it be human knowledge
it belong to the world like
shakespeare or aspirin
know what
i be going to do after we broadcast the
incriminate stuff
air the Skywire
code
then nobody can have a monopoly

where be you
you know you can not keep anything
from i

okay yeah
i do something naughty
there be this amazing Comix store in
seattle
be she buying it

to tell you the truth i do it once
or twice at stanford
guess i can not
keep anything from you

i will not turn you in

every entry be authorized

keep looking

you focus on the big
problem
but somewhere down the chain
something break down
something
get destroyed
at first it be
upset
you feel you have lost
control

so you have to remind yourself
it be
just the process
something always
lost along the way to anything
worthwhile
some little bug some
glitch
can not get bog down in
that you be do something other
people could never do
they lack the
imagination the brain the nerve
let they fret about every unforeseen
consequence
you have to solve the
problem

one more second

hey hey relax relax

oh i god

or do you

milo
wake up
we regular program
will not be preempt tonight

wait

when do you know

still watch the
screen
you should have called a few time to
bug i about you job prospect

milo
who be get Skywire

if milo do not launch Skywire who
do


now what be we do
i do not get
any of this shit

i launch Skywire
just pray the
last set of coordinate milo send i
connected we to Garys satellite


most of we who write software achieve
we great work before age
as
i grow old i know how important it
be to access fertile young mind

you know the scenario for this

last thing you want to do be hurt we
now
right

who be seeing this

who be not


we work hard to stay ahead because
we know any kid working in he garage
can put we out of business

the first rule of the software
business be
those who do not innovate
be doomed to die

that be why we work so hard to invent
or acquire great new application
consumer do not care where new idea
come from just so long as they be
offered at competitive price
be not
that what the free market about
sure we like be but it be
pressure too
this business be
binary
you be a zero or a one


guess we should wake the attorney
general

i have be called aggressive but to
i that be really a compliment

look at all the job and technology
i aggression have created



lyle
phone for you

we really be a family here at
outpost

i think that be why outsider sometimes
see we as cultish or secretive

milo it be not so bad really
alice

be loyalty and group spirit somehow
sinister nowadays

the murder stuff be all innuendo
bad legally null
could probably
be spun as urban legend
there be a
case for corporate espionage but if
you cop a plea you will get a slap

cop a plea
i be confuse ted
you
think i know about this

i be running the company fight
the raising a family
randy and
phil obviously overreact
to this
endless antitrust witchhunt

the government going to offer they a
helluva deal to tie you into this
whether you know about it or not

randy phil and whoever else know
about it

that will not be a problem



as for Skywirell take care of
all that

the world see it now
they know
it be going to dominate the convergence
market even beyond how outpost
dominate the desktop



go after we you give foreign
competitor a shot at the platform
that hold sway for year
you
threaten not just we chip and
partner like when you come after
the browser

you threaten network phone
company catalog outlet publish
house movie studio travel agent
airline stock brokerage you
sabotage the whole economy
talk
about undermine innovation

he be writing on a
legal pad
easy to spin old as the hill
what be
good for outpost be good for america

come on bob
load in the other disk

i have no knowledge of these
activity but i have to ask myself
if the competitive environment i
encourage in some small way
contribute

gary


the board oust gary boyd as
chairman they be assisting the
in the breakup of outpost into
division

that be get to kill he right

outpost be he baby sure
on the
other hand we just learned gary
boyd own the Skywire satellite
personally

outpost do not own em

Conglomeratesre line up to finance
the launch of the remain
satellite
they will pay he a huge
premium to get online

that would change with a criminal
indictment

there be no hard evidence he know
about this
anybody who could
implicate he seem to have vanished

be not there a stigma
bankrol
this guy

stigma
larry
billion buy you
some slack in this world

and the kid who write Skywire
then give it away
they be calling
he the digital robin hood

milo
surprise he be not you guest

we tried

you well believe everybody trying
to sign he up

larry lisa

you app kind of blow mine out of
the water

we will come up with the next big thing

you want to work here

get out of i other commitment

may i

hey wait
not giving everything away

mon
bring you stuff

space be that okay
