come through

god know
sometimes i think
they be just behind the wall

so they cheated you

bargain
they give i
experience i would never forget

but they pleasure be i pain

terrible pain
appalling
i body be forfeit
but i
spirit
they left that here
in the board
in the wall
watch the world but never
able to touch it
