we in mark step to include neighboring apartment
with identical frosted facade
then more apartment above and
below the tier linked by ramp and crosswalks
it might be a
prison cellblock but there be no guard apparent
indeed the
resident move freely all notably male all clad in shearlings
polo shirt and slack
it be just another day in sector four


Saties Gymnopedie play from overhead speaker
glass wall look out across a green mountain valley
the plaza
form in curve of creamy ceramic tile be divided into two service
area
male resident in line on one side female on the other
both
gender combine in the seat area
lincoln reach the head of
the line
he swipe he ethercuff o v e r a scanner

a surly woman in uniform eye the readout on she screen

lincoln less than appetized load he tray with the
oatmeal and juice breakfast
then he head into the seat area
in the seat area male and female resident sit eating and
chatting happily
uniformed busboy intermix clearing and wipe
table
divide in this community now start to become clear
the busboy like the nutrition clerk like all the service
maintenance and administrative staff we will see have distinct
uniform but no facial mark
they be known as outsider
the resident like lincoln have crosshatched scar on they
upper leave brow and ethercuffs o n they wrist

in a deliberate move she drop she napkin on the floor
as she
duck down to retrieve it lincoln steal a gulp of she coffee
rising again ester register he souring look

what be it
lincoln just nod across the plaza
ambient conversation be now
eb at an arrival
an outsider in a grey vaguely clerical
uniform sanguine settle precise eye
he might be a prison
warden but for the generally warm reception
he be known as the
community director
he name be
he cross to a lectern unlooping a chain from he neck with a
threeforked pendant known as a trikey
he slot the trikey
into the lectern
the glass wall frost over and pixellates i n t o
a live feed of himself
now amplify by the plaza speaker
merrick begin he address

applause and whistle erupt mostly from the young resident
who take on the zeal of a game show audience
the old one
including lincoln greet the prospect with labored tolerance
merrick turn the trikey i n the lectern
the glass wall
switch from the live feed to a jumbotron o f flash text





let the spin begin
to a burst of cheer he turn the trikey another notch
the
glass wall become a spin blur like a tumbler on a slot
machine
but instead of icon it click through name each
separated by a blank line from adams OneAlpha to zucker
three charlie scrol the entire population of sector four

as the spin slow a pent silence fall
expectant eye watch the
name click through the ps the qs the rs the ss and







Starkweather TwoDelta
step up
cheers and applause as everyone look for the lucky recipient
the excitement abate as it become clear he be not among they

well Starkweather if you be watch
on etherscreen you time have come i
friend

and the rest of you never lose hope
what do we know about the daily spin

everyone get to win

an d tomorrow it could be you
merrick step down and depart
the plaza revert to it former
mood dotted with murmur of disappointment
lincoln scowl

six month of mood swing sore back

the portal be span by a rank of lattice metal gate known as
an ethergate
resident swipe they ethercuffs o v e r scanner
the gate hiss open and they step through in systematic order



the subway form in arch of creamy ceramic tile be not
unlike we own
in place of escalator moving walkway deliver
the resident onto the platform
along the platform wall run a
strip of mirror panel etherscreen report in banner crawl


at the tunnel edge of the platform be a safety fence where the
resident wait in a patient line lincoln among they
he focus
be draw to two young resident whispering furtively nearby

stim unit say it hit the wall

okay
but i get to set the can
resident shrug and hand he a drink can
resident duck
under the fence reaching the can down to the track
or what
look like a track
the strut lining the bed be not sleeper
but buffer of galvanized rubber
nor be there any rail
the
relay system be provide by a series of metal post flank the
buffer to run in twin parallel
know as lodepoles they now
start thrum and pulse with red light like runway beacon

hurry it up
the shuttle coming
resident regain the platform
we on the drink can
balanced on a buffer
it start rattling
then suddenly shoot
upward into the air arce and bouncing off the tunnel wall
clatter into obscurity
resident whoop in victory
rush of air herald the shuttle
it sail out of the tunnel
floating three foot above the track
hybrid of subway car and
nautical craft it have runner in place of wheel like hull on
a catamaran
it be buoy by a magnetic flow emanate from the
lodepoles an invisible river known as a lodestream
the
shuttle drift to a gentle halt hovering rock a little
it
gangplank fold out toward the platform and the safety fence
lower
lincoln and the other commuter file routinely aboard

hey you want to know something
lincoln look up at a face grinning over the partition mid

he name be

the same face recoil from a punch
jones shake it off
retreating recover
he reset he guard as lincoln move in
lincoln jab at jones defenses he blow hitting hard than
we would expect from he stature
suddenly he break through with a
leave hook
jones stagger back
strange ripple distort his
face
stranger still he skin tone take on a grainy pallor
as the bout continue we widen to see the box ring be indeed
a ring rather than a square and beyond the rope be an outer ring
with lincoln in we now see another figure in the outer ring
mirrore he move dressed identically but for the glove which
be like gauntlet
the gauntlet be rig to two armature
which be in turn rig to a gantrylike mechanism
it glide
noiselessly to and fro shadowing the figure round the outer ring
reveal the figure be also lincoln
the real lincoln
in fact
the one in be a derivative hologram known as a proxy
as lincoln fake and jab the counterweighted armature drag
and recoil duplicate the exertion of he proxy
jones move
more sluggishly he proxy now ghostly transparent
now be
send on a last offensive only to be roundhoused by another left
hook
jones proxy topple and explode into a pixellated mist


Whoooooo
lincoln proxy and lincoln punch the air in victory
jones
unlatches he gauntlet sweating gall by the defeat

sure you input the right weight class

you be just too slow jonesy

you be fast because you be light

they always miss
something

hey you put up now pay up


rainbow light and swirling electronic music

in wireless head
set and white uniform they seem at once clinical and military
carry a tablet known as an etherboard

more imposing carry a widemuzzle rifle known as a stopgun
they foreboding appearance be greet without alarm
as they
move up the bar the customer dutifully swipe they ethercuffs
over the etherboard
now reaching jones who swipe accordingly

vita cola all the way officer
lincoln sip he cola
as they move on he grimace at the taste


lincoln stare out of the window
the red pulse of the lode pole
catch a glaze look in he eye
he pupil a little dilate
he focus return to the interior and an etherscreen banner





the horizon
the morning sun stream over the green mountain
lincoln lie sleeping he head buried under the pillow
off a
beeping sound he stir and squint up at the mirror ceiling



accept
the etherscreen resolve ester face fresh and bright

lincoln

she face blink out
lincoln get out of bed with a smile


lincoln exit he apartment and head up the walkway
we reveal
the walkway end at another ethergate governing residential
access
lincoln swipe he ethercuff o v e r a scanner and a gate
swing open
he head on the gate hiss closed behind he


Ravels Pavane play overhead
the plaza be emptying as resident
leave for work
lincoln arrive at the service counter
he
swipe he ethercuff and greet the clerk with an amiable grin

just juice today

lincoln shrug he gaze wandering past she into the kitchen
he grin fade as he spot talking to a busboy
then
the view be lost as he be serve an oatmeal and juice breakfast



not so crowd at this hour
halfway down the platform we see a
vend machine with confection in nameless silver wrapper

mouseish resident collect a bar from the trough
he name be

see lincoln approach he preempts

no no no
use you own sugar quota

mon kleinwort
he say this amicably enough but he be use he impose presence
on the small man
kleinwort sigh and break off a chunk

so what be up with the censor huh

they be conducting a census check
or
do not you watch the bulletin

i know what it be
i have just never
see they out in this sector before

probably just tracking a glitch
bad
scanner or maybe an userware defect
Ethercuffs
they get damage you get
a false read
sometimes even a dropout

what be you saying
they lost someone

someone just be not showing up where
they should be
what do you care
rush of air herald the shuttle curtail the conversation
beneath he tousle hair a frown play on lincolns brow



lincoln stare at the fractal on rightvisor at the intricate
path of dysplasia
the glaze look have return to he eye
he pupil a little dilate
he stare narrow at an errant
thought
he shrug it off
but the thought return persistent
more to dispel than indulge it lincoln turn to midvisor


census file

accomodation status
sector
the tiered box resolve zoom in to isolate apartment
the box show solid white
lincoln frown assimilate this

hey jonesy
remember the guy who win
the spin yesterday
he apartment
still showing as occupied



so

so you get hour to move out



maybe the system do not update yet

no
it update on the hour
if he be
go it should be showing a vacancy

what
you think he be still here
the
guy win a place on the island and you
think he just decided not to go

i do not know
he be not there to step
up
and now there be a census check

and now nothing
it be probably the
programmer mess up

maybe

stim unit say i can prove it
cross
reference with sanitation

sanitation status
sector four






see
standard procedure
they get to
sweep it for the next occupant
they supervisor interrupt they an outsider efficienttype

if you gentleman be not busy
perhaps
i could get an update on sector six

still in the electrical phase sir

well the guy upstairs be gripe
about the backlog
so go over there
and light some fire will you

i will take care of it

be not you forget something
or do you want to get contaminate


an arc of blue light
uniformed worker steer a plasma torch
over a conduit
in the fog of smoke we see wire be splice
circuit tested
outsider in hardhat goggle and cup mask
lincoln come over the crosswalk starkly contrasted in dacron
coverall and a hooded gasmask
intercept he
draw desiccated feature a husky drawl
he name be

sorry chief
i can not let you get any
closer
we get live wire over there
lincolns reply be muffled by the gasmask lost in the noise

what be that you said
lincoln repeat to no avail
frustrate he peel off he gasmask

i said i can not hear you
c o r d c h you c k l e s at the irony


he y you get yourself contaminate
do not come pointing the finger at i

how be you do mac

you know how it be
get to the end of
shift crew start draggin t h e i r foot

we l l the guy upstairs be gripe
about the backlog
they want to know
when you will be ready for move in

i guess if we bust we back we could
be out of here by the end of the week

i will tell they two week

thanks chief
i appreciate that

so


get any stuff on you today


sign read warn
contamination risk

lincoln stand by as
mccord you n l o o p s a neckchain w i t h a singleforked pendant known as
a unikey
he slot it into the top of three keyhole
light
start flash and the airlock give a heavily pressurize hiss


deep steady thrum
giant extractor fan churn above and below
both direction seemingly limitless
the bleak concrete shaft be
streaked with soot thread by ladder and catwalk
on one
such we isolate lincoln and mccord
o t h smoke cigarette

i t s too bad

what do you mean

h a t you shift almost over


you mean these thing
well these
thing be not good for you anyway

the y taste good
an exchange smile
pause as they enjoy the guilty pleasure

i like coming here
talking
most
outsider do not like to talk

that be because we be not suppose to
they get rule about fraternization
lincoln nod
another pause as they drag on they cigarette

what do you do when the shift over

o r e of the same
they cycle we onto
the disposal detail
hump n dump crew

you m p n dump crew

e b r i s clearance
we hump the heavy
stuff to a site on the outside

be it as bad as they say out there
c o r d l o o k s momentarily puzzle
lincoln display he gasmask

the air
the containment

right

but not everywhere
not on the island

i do not know too much about that
lincoln eye he narrowly
mccord p a you s e s then tuck he lighter
into the cigarette box and offer it with a palliative smile


he y take it from i you get a sweet
deal right here
so why worry huh
lincoln shrug accepting the gift with a slow exhale of smoke
we tilt up to follow the smoke plume dissipate into the fan


i r blast up from a giant tunnel
i d e n i n g we see it be one of a huge ring planted in the dust
backdropped b y mountainous red rock
at the hub of the ring be
a large cubic build
from it facet giant appendage of
duct plunge into it surround
these be the inlet for the
process air that feed the underground
this be the landscape of the world outside and manifestly above
r o m the processing plant we pull back and up raking over a
large industrial complex
more cubic building cream colore
windowless like stack of giant play brick
now we see the
front of the complex
the planate f a c a d e faceless but for the
entrance cube in polarize glass like a dark cyclopean eye
r o m the entrance we follow a walkway out to a dock where the
ground drop away into a broad concrete trench
like the subway
lined with lodepoles and buffer it be known as a lodeway
from the dock we follow the lodeway out to a perimeter wall
red
rock slab twenty foot high frame a giant gateway
the gate
now glide open to disclose a view of the world outside the wall
the shimmering bleach wilderness of the arizona desert
you t in the distance where the lodeway taper into the scrub a
vehicle emerge from the shimmer
hybrid of bus and nautical
craft single hull known simply as a liner
now as the
liner become clear a decal on it prow be revealed a
crosshatch insignia over a blocky l e g e n d the sanger institute


the polarize glass show the liner have docked and
be disembark
the man be mostly over bloated by luxury
the woman mostly under wife and girlfriend all jewel and
haute couture
they filter into the entrance hall to be greet
by the courtesy staff
pretty girl in short skirt and blazer
with the crosshatch insignia lead by a pert redhead named

a d i e s and gentleman i name be lydia
and on behalf of we staff i would like
t o welcome you to the sanger institute


before we start the tour we will be serv
i n g r e f r e s h m e n t s in the visitor center
and circulating we standard discretion
agreement
i should add that today you
be all very lucky because we and
founder dr
henry sanger be with we
and will be leading the tour personally


the crosshatch emblem spin on a walltowall screen
not a real
screen but a project flat known as a holoframe
here lydia
assemble the tour group nurse wine glass and canape
the
holoframe fade up a serene music track and a commercial begin
series of vignette
an old man shuffling on a walk frame
a middleage woman in a bthe suit one breast flattened by a
mastectomy a young woman in labor she face knotted in pain
the group watch with frown and disapproving mumble
then
i


i t s not a pretty sight be it
y e s turn to a figure behind they dressed in a vestmental w h i t e
labcoat s tall slightly hunched by senility eye like
quicksilver glitter
he have the hauteur of a visionary
stoop to the role of a salesman
he name be



o r t a l i t y
we all know it face and yet
w e look away do not we
we deny that we
l i v e s be ordained to suffer
that
w e be all inalterably going to die
he pause field the various disconcert look
then smile


i t take courage to confront mortality
i friend
and i see it in each of
y o you
i name be dr
henry sanger and
i be here to reward you courage
y d i a applaud
the tour group dutifully follow suit
sanger
whisper a question in Lydias ear
she broadcast she response

o d a y s group be from new gaza health
care
they be with the platinum plan


e w gaza
yes very good oncology unit
you l l i n g this he amble through the holoframe which ripple at
he passage
rally by lydia the tour group follow he into



hall of window each window frame a display case each
display case housing a different taxidermied a n i m a l
not unlike
a museum
on close inspection more like a chamber of horror
i n one window be a pig with a horribly distended abdomen
another
magnified show a mouse with a human ear grow on it back
in
another a chimpanzee stare out at we with glaringly human eye


i t do not get any pretty do it
but this be not a freakshow i friend
this be a war museum
history of we
battle with mortality
and defeat
take the stem cell for instance
bid
to cultivate human part for transplant
in rodent primate barnyard animal
it be enough to make you skin crawl
in
some case literally giving rise to a
new range of crossspecies virus
but
that be how we learn
from we mistake
the y turn a corner
another hall of window portal onto tank
of amber fluid that might be formaldehyde
suspended within be
embryo fetuse and infant
all human
all grotesquely mutate


a s e in point the clone
back in the
beginning the map of the human
genome be declared a historic landmark
t o break the curse of heredity to
correct congenital defect
genetic
engineering become the brave new world
of medical science
bright future
that lead to a dark age and much of the
legislation we know today
but while
the clone law may have narrow the
field science march on
only to hit
the same wall over and over again the
enigma of growth the alchemy that
take we from embryo to adult
clone
barely reach infancy before it
growth enzyme misfire resulting in
the kind of monstrosity which be
only effigy you see here
o m e reassured sigh from the woman
they turn another corner onto
another hall
hall of mirror
simple fulllength mirror


so what do we learn from we mistake
that human part cannot grow outside a
human body
that human body cannot
grow outside nature grand design

support he bulk with a walk stick grunt

o what the hell be we do here


e t s say one day you go to you doctor
for a checkup
he discover you have
imminent renal failure and require a
kidney transplant
what would you do

i would not do nothing
i brothered
g i v e i one of his
or else


v e n if you brother kidney be with
o you t defect there be still a chance
of rejection
or less if he be you twin

he be not
he be old


but what if you do have a twin
f f the fat mane confuse look sanger smile and gently coax
he to face a mirror
they reflection stare back at they


what if you have a genetic double who
give you not just one of he kidney
but both
in fact any organ or body
part you ever have because to need

what
you mean like a clone
i think
you said all that stuff be a bust


i said the problem with a clone be it
do not survive infancy
the solution
be to find a different start point
why sow the seed when you can create
the fruit
or what we like to call
an agnate
y d i a start clapping
then s t o p s realize this be not a cue


an agnate be sequenced from a point on
the cellular timeclock
i t be spawn
postmaturate
it be created adult



f course it brain be still vestigial
s o for the first three year we keep it
i n suspension
during which time we use
d a t a impression to supply a template
f o r functionality a process we call
f o you n d a t i o n
after foundation we
t r a n s f e r the agnate into containment
w h e r e it enter the conditioning
p r o c e s s
an ongoing series of quality
c o n t r o l s design to test and maintain
i t s functionality
after a minimum of
t w o year conditioning the agnate
b e c o m e s eligible for harvest
an d you i friend get you new kidney
hush fall among the group as they process what they have hear
it be a sign of the time that none of they seem to be horrify

e t i see if i get this straight
you
can create this whatever
this walk
spare part holder
but i get to w a i t
five year to get hold of em


the spare part as you put it need to
be tested for integrity
but as many of
we client leave it till late in life
to take out the policy we do offer the
option for early harvest
given the
risk however a waiver be required

o five year or no warranty
for the
premium you be asking


an d what if the organ you needed be a
heart
ask yourself each of you
if
you have to put a price on you life
you very survival what would it be
deep lull as the group consider this
sanger pick he moment


i t s a question you insurance company
have already answer
for they the
agnate obviate costly and ineffective
treatment program
should you decide
t o take out we policy not only will
they lower you exist premium but
they will also cover the production cost

the incentive ripple across the face
trouble one speak up
you
this agnate
what happen to it
after we friend here get he kidney


that be entirely he decision
we role
be intermediary
we as the insurance
provider guarantee the condition and
availability of the agnate but all
other right be retain
in legal
term the policy holder be defined as
a sponsor
the premium in effect
becoming sponsorship payment
maintain the agnate until such time
as harvest be required
at such time
and where feasible the sponsor have
the option to extend sponsorship
retaining the agnate for secondary
harvest or shall we say let the
policy expire
you
x p i r e
you mean
let it die


o
not as you and i know it at least
the association of life and death be
no more applicable to an agnate than to
a cow in a field
it exist in a state
of limit consciousness aware not of
life but of functionality
imbue with
the knowledge to maintain it function
but without the capacity to question it
and yet in many way the end if the
most humane part of the process
the
agnate go to harvest without any fore
b o d i n g and be painlessly return to the
sleep from whence it come
eternal or
otherwise
there be mortality for an
agnate
just utility and redundancy
you
o it do not know
it do not know
it
it p you r p o s e in life


h o do know i friend
who among we
know we true purpose in life
a n g e r amble on plunge in thought
lydia pick up the slack


this month we be offering a special
rate for new sponsor
including a
discount on the hisandhers plan
she usher the group round another corner
another holoframe and
another commercial display the same character as the first
the old man with the walk frame be now running in a park
the woman with the mastectomy be now at a party she cocktail
dress broadcasting a full cleavage the young mother be now in
a waiting room smile as a doctor hand she a newborn baby



would you like to close


yes


now some of you may be think
this commercial be stage
but these be
not actor these be past customer
real p e o p l e enjoy the real f r you i t s of
sponsorship
what we offer here at the
sanger institute be not just health
insurance but indemnity
what we offer
be the chance of a new lease on life
the tour group applaud this time without prompting from lydia


o w lydia will walk you through the
rest of the tour and explain the
various limitation and exclusion
but i do have time for a few question
a n d s be raised
waspishlooking woman butt ahead of they

the commercial
the girl with the baby
what be that
fix for infertility


you mean the maternity plan
no
o t endemic infertility at least
as i
said the law prohibit genetic
alteration so a defect endemic in a
sponsor will also be present in they
agnate
no what the maternity plan
provide be a way round the risk and
rigor of childbirth
under this plan
an agnate become eligible for
pregnancy shortly after foundation

simple donation of sperm from the
father then the agnate be fertilized
and bring you baby to term


an d then what
you get it in the mail


o r practical reason delivery be
handle by you healthcare p r o v i d e be

an d the agnate what happen to it
when it be you know deliver


the same rule apply
you can continue
you sponsorship
or not
and in this
case there be a natural window for
compliance as the agnate be routinely
sedate after delivery
as to whether
it wake up from that sleep like i
said the choice be yours

an y t h i n g to avoid stretchmark right
the other tour member some more guiltily than other laugh


i r blast up from the same giant tunnel swallow the laugh


the acoustic hollowing as we look up from the now empty catwalk
the blast of air fade into the deep steady thrum of the fan


the thrum fade to silence
flat measure silence as we
revisit the community in soundless montage
the residential
block the frosted facade
the nutrition plaza the counter
the chute
the subway the moving walkway
Centerville the
building now emit a trickle of agnate ending they
workday unwitting participant in they own great utility

he name be Starkweather TwoDelta
he
drop off the ether two day ago
at
first we think it be a system error
then we find this in a garbage chute
he open a drawer and pull out an ethercuff
he hand it to
scheer who consider it remotely for a few second
then

he look albeit from a distance throw a stone
merrick harden

i f you bothered to read the clone law
you would realize we have no choice in the
matter
the virtual humanity statute
accord they a set of freedom
all we
can do be prescribe the limit
and
even those be subject to regulation
scope of knowledge range of activity
even they speech pattern
the law
require that what be of human origin
be provide with human characteristic

you mean like fallibility
merrick pause
he be not going to take the bait

the ether show no attempt on the
boundary
he be here karl
but for
some reason you man seem unable to

offbalance a stab of pain keel he onto the rail
converging like white ghost
from the purple haze one reprimand he recalcitrant cohort


you asshole
you hook the wrong one
he crouch to examine lincoln
blood be blossome from a wound
on he shoulder jut from which be a projectile
the censor
press it base and it snap loose of it unintended target
o w we see the projectile more clearly
fat metal pellet snub
n o s e d fin at the tail by four metal tooth
on impact the
nose recess to release a springload a n d the tooth snap forward
to bite into the target
this device be known as a hookhead

you s t a flesh wound
hit he head
pretty hard
possible concussion
h i n k you can walk buddy
lincoln nod slightly
the censor unloops a trikey f r o m he neck

you see this
it will get you past the
lockdown
you be to report to the
medical center
you understand
f f lincolns blank stare the censor press the trikey i n t o
he palm
then depart
lincoln stay where he sit still daze
from the concussion
absently he watch the censor race off up
the walkway dissolving back into the purple haze as we
you



meeting white uniform at every turn zig
z a g g i n g o v e r crosswalks down ramp
the rat in the maze dumb to
it inevitable destination
widen we see we be watch the
action on etherview rack and dollying like a deific e y e

a s t side team hold position
subject
headed for the second floor crossramp


l o a k e d in shadow scheer listen to the playbyplay on headset
with a tap he change the channel whispering to he squad
be
i v e he some space
i have he

Starkweather hit the deck run sprinting up
the avenue
in scheer step forth stopgun l e v e l l e d aim

the flash of the muzzle the shrill wail of the hookhead
you Starkweather jolt as the shot hit he square in the
back arching as the hookhead b i t e s
but he keep on running
scheer unleash he ordnance filling the air
you you you Starkweather jolt from one two three more
hit
hookheads b i t i n g spray blood
but he keep on running
be
l l clear
flood the area

floor level as between the tile tiny red light
start blinking rippling forward in a wave
know as lodepins
they small magnetic pulse accumulate into a low level stream
the hookheads c l a w e d in Starkweathers back also start blinking
red
the invisible stream flowing beneath he foot Starkweather
feel it force
the duell polarity stealing he traction
he run reducing to a slipsliding s t a g g e be
then he foot leave
the ground
he flail for a handhold
but there be nothing
the
force lift he a foot clear off the ground before balance out
to dangle he in midair squirm about like a fish on a hook

scheer advance to reel in he catch
the stream
bow before he red light blinking out
until all that remain
be the section where Starkweather hang suspend
scheer stop
at it limit looking up at he like some curious zoo exhibit
be
o o d he cuff he patch the bleed
then let we get he up to level three

looking down from high above as the censor move
in on Starkweather
scheer now walking away tapping he headset
be
t h e r c o n
send word to dispatch
Starkweather TwoDelta be secured

lincoln in looking down
he have see and hear
all that have just passed
in he eye we see he daze clear
consciousness coalesce deepen
he pupil dilate into a
deep and uncanny stare
what can only be described as a dawning


o w full but unusually quiet
resident sit in whisper anxious
discourse
the news of the incident be spreading
off a series of
chime eye turn to the glass wall now pixellating i n t o an
outsider face calm official
begin


good morning this be a community
bulletin
following an incident in
sector four early this morning the
department of sanitation be issue an
allsector contamination warn
the rapt concern of the resident ester among they

the incident involve a resident find
to be infected with a pathogen
while
the risk be assessed resident be
advise to be aware of the symptom
should you experience aberrant level
of anxiety or witness it in other
immediately contact the medical center


the proxy of Starkweather spin over the desk
merrick regards
i t with a frown
scheer sit turning the ethercuff i n he finger
with a demeanor of cool curiosity
underneath he be rattled

you want to tell i what be going on

there be nothing going on karl

i be jaded
not stupid

what be you point

i checked up
in the past year three
product have destabilize
all of they
delta
and there be nothing going on

you be jumping to conclusion

once i can overlook
twice i can call
coincidence
three time i start giving
a shit
because if these product be
defective

you a l i t y control be not you concern


o it be a quality control issue

that be not what i said

he be in the subway tunnel for two
day
in the dark no food no water
he finger be scrape to the bone
he be trying to dig he way out
now
you try to explain to i why that be
he look say he smell a rat
merrick weigh he a moment
then
sigh a little deplete
he get up and cross to the glass
wall
look down on the avenue at the agnate m i l l i n g beneath

it be not an exact science biogenesis
there be a degree of trial and error
if
the agnate do not come together on the
first pass we have to abort and start
over
it be like breaking inertia
the
bioreactor the growth medium we just
keep up the level till we achieve
integration
at which stage the agnate
be deem physically stable
we rely on
foundation to provide mental stability
matching the template to they capacity
but walling it in with parameter
when sign of instability start to
show up it pointed to foundation

hole in the wall an oversight
but it
be only happening in the late generat
ion
which pointed back to biogenesis

so there be a production defect

actually the opposite
we find out in
the late generation the level be
so high that when we broke inertia the
process keep going
Overintegrating
specifically the neural system
it
produced a condition called synesthesia

Synesthesia


fusion of the sense create a
component awareness
sixth sense
s e c o n d sight whatever you want to call
it
it emergence seem to be arbitrary
but it give they experience beyond
they functional parameter
and
ultimately
it destabilize they
however if we catch it early enough we
can control it with recondition
scheer absorb this with a slow grin
merrick look puzzle

you find this amuse

poetic

poetic

this agnate take off just before his
sponsor place an order
maybe he get
the sense he day be numbered
merrick s composure crack a little
he have not think of this

this stay between you and i karl
i
trust i can rely on you cooperation

do not you mean i complicity

remind i why be it you be
discharge from the military

what be you point

learn to be a team player karl
or
you will find yourself out of another
job
scheer rise discard the ethercuff onto merricks desk

nobody else would take it



the deep steady thrum of the extractor fan
we be the
frame of an airlock
hiss it indent and open
lincoln step
through eye black and uncanny
the trikey g l i n t i n g dangle
from he finger
scanning around he fix on a section of wall
he wipe off some soot
legible beneath be a number
twenty
he
assimilate this
then turn he gaze up the extractor shaft


look up an elevator shaft
the red pulse of the lodepoles
rippling downward as an elevator descend from the surface


tile chamber
drape off cubicle
the elevator door slide
open
an outsider emerge dressed in a flightsuit emblazon
medical courier
he announce himself seemingly to no one

okay you be
clear
go ahead and get undress


the pressure door hiss heaving open
the courier step inside
naked covering he genital some goggle sling around he neck
he take position on two mark footpad and put on the goggle

i tell you i hate this fuck r you n
i
always leave this place with sunburn
i
try fullcourse decontamination
it be
even more fun
especially the colonics
the light blink out
red glow rise
twin plane of light
scrape across the courier infrared sear he epidermis


chamber like the first
the inner pressure door hiss open
the courier emerge dripping wet from a decon s h o w e be
he go
to a cubicle grab a towel and dry himself off
laid out
within be some scrub
beside they be inset
with a thermostat and embossed with the crosshatch insignia



the courier stroll up the corridor now dressed in the scrub
and carrying the cooler
he turn a corner and he footstep
gradually fade out
flat sterile silence fall in he wake
metal squeal
ventilation grid lever down from the ceiling
pause
then a pair of foot drop through leg torso
drop
to the floor lincoln stand revealed
sweaty smear black
with dust
for a moment he look around to get he bearing
suddenly he freeze hearing



h e c k in at the nurse station
up
the corridor left then first right
the footstep be now coming back
lincoln spin round
he find
a door
lock panel
moment of panic
then he fumble the tri
k e y f r o m he pocket hurriedly slot it into the lock panel


lincoln wait ear to the door listening as the footstep pass
and fade out of earshot
lincoln release he breath in relief
calming a little then frown as he register another sound
very faint rhythmic
he turn and look around
the room be in
partial shadow
to one side be a row of seat to the other a
row of window covered by blind light crease through
the
sound repeat
muffled
but now unmistakably


grid of bioreadouts each square alive with graph and digit
the familiar baseline of a cardiograph
leverarm mounted with
an r e s e r v o i be dangle tube and wire onto the table
we see and in whose arm
squirm and bawl
lying on the table we see she
foot up in stirrup deeply flushed and puff from exertion
mark by she crosshatch as an agnate she have just given birth

may i hold she

we have to run a few test on she first
in the meantime i be going to give you
something to help you relax okay
off he smile the agnate mother nod anxiously watch the
midwife wrap she baby in blanket
the doctor tap a button and
watch the reservoir mist with a pale colored fluid

the cardiograph mark the drop as the fastacting sedative take
effect
the agnate mother watch drowsily as the midwife take
she baby from the room
then the cry of the newborn be shut out
you s t the cardiograph now the beep evening out the scart o f
peak shallow a s the agnate mother fall asleep
the doctor
tap a button
on the grid the face of a appear

i be incubate the baby for hour
prior to transport
but go ahead and
contact the sponsor
tell she she have
a beautiful baby girl
the nurse nod
the grid square go blank
pause
then the
doctor tap another button
text appear
read it he cite

let the record show the sponsor have
sign clause of the basic sponsor
s h i p agreement
initiate compliance
light start blinking
the doctor walk stiffly out of the
room
the door hiss close
the agnate mother be left alone
sleeping peacefully blind to the fluid now seeping into she
e a f to the slow beep of the cardiograph
the peak of the
baseline falling
spacing fade slow slow until
the cardiograph flatlines
an d a sepulchral stillness fall
we
angle widen with the grow emptiness
the lifelessness


lincoln look down from above eye frozen in the slatted light
he finger be trembling rattling the blind against the glass


lincoln tumble out of the door
he can not breathe can not think
he mind be in overload
he stumble around like a wound
animal
he focus suddenly and searingly r e t you r n s as he hear



Starkweather
like the football player


rotunda spoke by corridor
console at it hub manned by
the desk nurse we see early
the courier stand over she

that be right
Starkweather


still showing in surgery
sorry

honey i get a bird on the pad and a
storm moving in
how longes it going to be


another grid of readout
another cardiograph beep
spotlamp
illuminate the table and he face
slack with anesthesis eye rolling a little beneath the lid
the rest of he under a sheet cut out over the belly the flesh
slit and part by a clamp frame a window into he innards
standing over he midoperation and
interrupt by a chime the surgeon look up at a screen where
a panel flash

he cradle he bloody glove and
elbow a button
the face of the desk nurse resolve on screen

the courier here for pickup

well he be going to have to wait a while
it take forever to put this one under



doctor

he be asking for an
say something
about some kind of storm moving in

for christs sake be that i fault
just find a way to stall he okay

doctor

what be it

subject heart rate be spiking

not again
boost the anaesthetic lev
suddenly he be sprayed with blood a s the clamp spring loose from
the stomach clatter to the floor
he be frozen by shock as

Starkweather sit bolt upright
dazed he look at the surgeon
the tech then down at he wideopen stomach
instinctively he
clutch it
then he mind assimilate the horror he
now launching off the operate table the leverarm swinging
out blindsiding t h e tech tube and wire snap loose
instrument flying Starkweather lunge for the doorway the
surgeon step up to block he only to be hurl aside



Starkweather clump down the corridor
clutch he open stomach blood streaming down he leg
he be
delirious run nowhere anywhere running blind
reach the
end of the corridor he stop suddenly seeing
he double back up the corridor
kicking at door with bare foot
frantic for any means of escape
he spot a ventilator grid
slightly open
he jump reaching for it
once twice then he
foot slip from under he
he hit the floor with a damp splat
turn the corner ready for action
but there be
Starkweather facedown in a starburst o f he own blood

yeah no sweat subject be secured



look down through the slit onto
Starkweather directly beneath
he now have a loose white hood over
he head
he wrist and ankle be bound by plastic cuff

loop of intestine plump out from he belly
he weight be such
that the censor have to drag he away leaving a bloodsmear o n
the floor
he guttural whimper be the only sign of life

lincolns face in part shadow looking down
the gleam
of he eye as Starkweather disappear from view
listening now
to those feeble whimper growing faint ever faint until
they disappear from earshot
silence again
emptiness
all that
remain of Starkweather be a wend bloodsmear o n the floor



the horizon
the green mountain in different aspect framed by
a different window
the bedroom be like lincolns but with a few
feminine touch
ester in she papery pajamas sit brushing
she hair
with a chime etherscreen scale over she reflection
i

he face blink out
ester be left frown at she reflection


lincoln stare at he own mirror image
he eye fraught with
revelation
he clothes begrime with dirt and blood
he rest
he head against the etherscreen panel shudder pressing his
eye tightly closed
as if he could ever forget what he be see


the routine flow of resident up the avenue
lincoln walk head
bow trying to look inconspicuous
shower white shirt and
blue slack under he shearling he look a little too scrub
too clean
he spot a familiar figure up ahead
he catch up

jonesy


o n e s let we he fall into step with a look of mild curiosity


hey champ

the censor move in tightening aim on he
ester look on anxiously as he approach lincoln
lincoln now

the same cuff
used on Starkweather promising the same fate

roundhoused b y the censor the blow sending he to the floor
ester wince at the pain clutch she belly
instinctively protectively an ominous scowl knot she face
kicking he down the aisle then
suddenly hearing a noise from behind turning to face it as
i
the brief wail of a hookhead
you lurch as the hookhead b i t e s
starting to gag blood jetting from he neck a hookhead
c l a w e d into he jugular gurgling collapsing to the floor
ester holding the stopgun seeing lincoln now
get up she drop the stopgun l i k e it be on fire aghast

lincoln

silence the rasp of the
censor blood foam another sound
lincoln go
to the door an
he grab ester




lead by scheer pushing through into the
main hall the statue of dr
sanger looking serenely down


a pressure door swing open lincoln
and ester tumbling through running up the maintenance corridor


sweeping the hall stopguns r e a d y scheer
find the fall censor crouch to examine he then

somebody get someone down here
censor split off to join he tapping he headset scheer
rise again in he eye detachment yield to cold intensity




flooding through into the maintenance corridor in
they white uniform they seem like a swarm of antibody

deeper in at another pressure door fumble
the trikey i n t o the lock
tense second
the lock hiss open

push through the open gap of another pressure door
taking the lead he censor surging up in he wake

meeting an intersection veer at random
running blind run deeper into the faceless labyrinth

catching up hitting the intersection pause to split
he squad in each direction white uniform dispersing

reaching another pressure door
footstep
audible
lincoln jam the trikey i n t o the lock
and wait
the
second pass
but the door do not open
lincoln look around
for another exit
ester look at he in mounting panic then

not onto a corridor but an elevator
car
pull ester inside lincoln find an array of button
he finger hover uncertain which to press
so he punch all
of they stab madly trying to prompt the door to close

turn a corner seeing he quarry at the far end of the
corridor he gather pace
the elevator be close but he do not
break stride
he deftly tap he headset opening a channel to

Ethercon
the elevator override it
do you read i
bring it back down


Ethercon be working the console key like a madman
he gaze
flit to a subgrid o f the complex spinning the angle
navigate the mesh of line
he voice come apologetically

you be off the grid sir
give i a
second
can you tell i where you be
he recoil at the blaring volume of the response


scheer stand with he censor poise watch the panel chart
the elevator descent
light flash and the door open
they
level they stopguns o n


nothing
the elevator be empty


foundation level all of they

they down
access only on i command


dead acoustic
corridor pave with sound proof panel
it
end at a pressure door where lincoln and ester now arrive
lincoln look back to the elevator at the other end
no going
back
he slot the trikey into the lock
the door hiss open


amber light
the sound of slow bubbling
lincoln and ester pause
to adjust to the gloom
they be in a hall of window
ester be
the first to venture forth as if draw to the near window
behind the glass be a foundation tank
bubbling with viscous
fluid lace with various tube pulse matter to and fro
the
tube connect to a form
human form an adult form but curled
foetally
i t be known as a nascent
in this tank be a female
nascent shift slightly cause ester to gasp
the nascent
register the noise turning it head
it eyelid be closed but
it eyeball move questioning
slight furrow appear on it
crosshatched brow
ester recoil in sudden horror perhaps
remembering on some deep level that this be where she come from

ester
come on
spur to action ester follow lincoln onward up the hall
still conscious of movement all around of nascents stirring at
the sound of they footfall like the ripple of a nightmare


n o s e s through the door
follow by scheer moving in
silence hone
how much time have passed be unclear
he signal
he censor to split off
tracking Scheers advance we

censor making they sweep
strobe
of light from an armature mechanism moving up the row of tank
it angle to project a grid across each nascent face then
fire a short laser burst searing a crosshatch into the brow

another contingent move up another
row of foundation tank
the nascents within have cable plug
into they ear filament pulse
the nascents a r e in a posture
of rigor sinew strain as they accept the data impression
as he reach the end of the first chamber
no **further/far access just a continue wrap of foundation tank
he pause confuse for a second
one of the censor come up


nothing sir
no sign

they can not have get past this level
scheer peel off he headset giving full leash to he sense
strain to concentrate
second of pent silence
then he hear
a faint hum
he gaze slowly drift up to a ventilator grid




the funnel mouth frame a vista of the world
outside
hostile vista of black sky maelstroms of sand
the
sound of blast air suborn to the giant howl of a

reach over the funnel lip as lincoln pull himself up
with a mighty effort
blinking blinded by the sand he swing
astride the lip
then he reach down to pull ester up
ester
gain the lip and likewise swing astride coughing blink
as lincoln leap down to meet it
we track up as
he help ester down from the funnel
she foot meeting the earth
we be now in o n they face
gape and blinking at the
prospect of the world outside
world of darkness and storm
as halogen explode the darkness
lincoln
shield he eye scanning for they source
he spot a large
cubic build bank of spotlight on the roof
he pull ester
away
away from the light and towards the safety of darkness



scheer pace on a catwalk
white
uniform above and below flashlight rove slice by the
blade of the extractor fan
from somewhere come a shout
be


sir
we get em
motion sensor just
picked they up at the surface



more spotlight engage they blaze
flooding across the foreview catching two figure
lincoln and
est run now veer sharply away from the light
now
disappearing from sight dropping into the trench of the lodeway



the elevator cram with
censor
scheer at the front stare ahead
he look very
focused bitterly so
the look of a man outwit by lab rat




lincoln and ester running along the
lodeway stumble over the buffer
above they the dust
flail in lashing tongue starkly depicted by the halogen


censor spill forth into the
halogen light split in all direction
scheer suddenly
notice the corona of light from the front of the complex
he
bark something inaudible to he man launching into a run



beneath lincoln and ester on they
knee clawing at the dust
like burrow animal trying to
widen the gap between the foot of the gate and the lodeway



as scheer reach the forecourt stopping
to scan the spotlit view the veil of the duststorm
he face
tightening with urgency
suddenly he tap he headset barking
be
the lodeway
flood it
light it up


barely audible over the storm
lincoln and ester washed by pulse red light
est recoiling
she arm flinging back from the pull
lincoln grab she he
own arm strain now
the polarity tug they ethercuffs


from the lodeway as scheer race up the
edge eye trawl the trench for he quarry
he pace now
suddenly dropping slow to a halt
he double over catching
he breath
more white uniform now appear from the dust as the
censor unable to match he pace finally catch up
the first
reaching he scheer pull upright bellowing over the wind

e t i a bird

bird
in this storm

the y get out
they get past the gate

scheer spin on he heel back towards the institute
the censor
linger confuse
then he fix on the lodeway
float past
in the red wash be the luminous blue seam of two ethercuffs


the perimeter wall silhouette in the middledistance
lincoln
and ester scramble through the scrub blinded by dust driven by
momentum
as ester start lagging behind lincoln grab she arm

ester
we have to keep going
but ester resist he breaking loose from he grasp
lincoln
look at she uncomprehending
until he see she expression the
harrowed stare in she eye the labored heave of she chest

ester
est stagger back losing balance reel as if spun by the
storm
she eye widening sense flooding
the howl wind the
swirling dustclouds the pendent gulf of black sky
she reel
returning she to face lincoln ester open she mouth to speak
but all that come be
scream from deep within shrill
and hysterical the only articulation she can find
lincoln grab
she and cover she mouth
fighting to stifle she rock to she
convulsion
but ester keep screaming
scream of everything


all be still
just a mute shudder of wind on glass
the room be
in shadow
all we see be a canopy bed where a figure
obscure lie sleep
the still be disrupted by a chime
the
figure stir fumble at the nightstand
holoframe resolve
the light revealing dr
sanger rumpled by sleep
he peer into
the holoframe to find the face of merrick gaunt with concern
merrick
he n r y


there be be a breach




horizon
brim of dawn over the red rock
the view be framed
by the mouth of a cave
lincoln sleep within slump against
the rock he head bow heavily
the touch of first light open
he eye
he brow crease as if waking from a bad dream into
a bad reality
he look around only to find himself alone
he
get up a little shaky at first then venture out of the cave

he emerge onto a ledge perhaps fifty foot up
he pause eye
adjust to the quality of light
he see the storm have reduced
to a low wind combing the floorland o f scrub
now across the
ledge he see ester
perched on an outcrop hug she knee
watch the sunrise over the desert
he cross and lower to a
crouch beside she
ester turn to he with a confuse frown

h e r e do all the green go
lincoln look deep into she trouble eye
he answer gently

the r e be no green
the window in
there
they be just picture
ester absorb this with difficulty
lincoln rise again and
stand looking out across the desert into the barren unknown


from the massive sky grow a glint shape
like a helicopter
but sleek aquiline
without combustion it only noise be the
sibilance of blade slice air
it be known as a whisper


the pilot jockey with the thermal
scheer ride shotgun
now
in civvy scanning the terrain with electronic binoculars
the
flight console beep
he tap a keypad
holoframe resolve

ground team checking in

anything

the storm pretty much covered they
track
we be scanning for thermal
b you t the hot it get the hard it
be to isolate a heat signature
i do not
know sir it be a big desert out there


the desert sun cleft the chasm into light and shadow
lincoln
trudge into view ester lagging behind
he stop to let she
catch up only to watch she slump onto a rock
he allow she a
moment to rest and walk to where the chasm come to an end

he survey the terrain
he eye roam the carpet of scrub now
narrowing on an inconsistency
faint strip where nothing seem
to grow
trace it lineage he walk a few foot out
then
drop to a crouch and start clawing away at the dust
he finger meet something hard
he sweep off the dust to expose
a layer of concrete
continue revealing the ghost of a line
what we might recognize as a lane marker but a curiosity to he
continue open a window in the dust
now he finger snag
o n something
he tug it and it give a little dust crumbling to
reveal a section of rust chainlink
corner of metal be
visible
lincoln expose the rest
sign barely legible

government restricted area
he frown trying to assimilate
ester come up to join he
off she anxious look he decide

i think i have find a path


h i t e rock blanket by stand of fir and ponderosa pine

whisper skim over the treecaps circling in on a high shelf
here remotely nestle in a clear stand a glass villa


the flood of light the majestic view lend an air of beatitude
the decor be minimalist with native american accent kokopelli
spirit in carved silhouette
dr
sanger stand at a glass wall
looking out across the green mountain valley
on the sofa sit
merrick now in civvy still gaunt from worry
the air stir
as a maid usher in s all business sharp blue
eye a severe mannish coiffure
she name be

good morning gentleman

bernard this be ellen crowne from we
legal department
ellen this be
bernard merrick director of product

thank you for coming out here

well when henry called i i get the
sense it be not for a social visit
they settle at a table
jug of icewater a n d glass laid out

i understand there be an incident


first let i stress there be no way we
could have anticipated what happen

we be on the same team mr
merrick
just give i the fact downanddirty

Wev e lost two of we product
they
escaped containment last night
crowne cast a trouble look at sanger
merrick quickly add
merrick
however we have all available
resource dedicated to the search

how exactly do this happen

wer e still piece it together

do we expect more product to escape


do not be so alarmist ellen

i be sorry henry but you ask i
here to assess we liability

to answer you question we condition
we product with a deterrent
fear of
contamination
and thereby of the outer
environment
so to escape they first
have to escape they conditioning
crowne pause to absorb this and to light a slim black cigarette

containment be one of the term of we
state health license
the fact it be
compromise could put we in violation


bureaucracy


henry it be a bloody battle get
we license through in the first place


they be not going to pull we license
ellen
we have a lot of friend on the
commission
not to mention the goodwill
we earned in when we take over the
facility
a bunker complex for a bio
chemical war that never happen
we
relieved they of a costly embarrassment

i be not sure we can rely on that


alright
what do you suggest

first i need you to level with i
what be we chance of finding they

well in we favor they have never be
outside containment
they would have no
coordinate no sense of direction

i do not see how that be in we favor

they be in the middle of the desert
food and water become an issue

so they might return to the trough

possibly

and if not
how long could they last

few day maybe
but there be another
variable
we maintain the product in a
sterile environment
so basically they
immune system be untested
toxin
pathogen environmentals t h e rest of
we overcome routinely to they



that be a little drastic
some immune
system be more adaptive than other

let we take the drastic case
what then

well


the male we could cover
fast
track another generation before the
sponsor ever needed access
the female
come under the maternity plan
she be
three month pregnant
even if we fast
track another generation we could not
fasttrack the pregnancy
we would miss the
delivery date the sponsor would wonder
why and there would be
difficulty
crowne look worry
sanger pour a glass of icewater


even so the bad may not happen

we have not even touched on the bad
if
these product reach a populated area
there be the problem of scrutiny


ellen we operate under state license on
a lease from the federal government

we slipped through a loophole in the
clone law henry
and they only let
you s through because they smell money
and they give we a government basement
to cover they own a s s e s not ours
it be
at the core of we license why we
screen potential sponsor why we make
they sign discretion agreement why
containment be such a critical factor
to limit the extent of public scrutiny


i t h e r way it be unlikely they would get
that far
it be at least twenty mile to
the next settlement
right bernard
merrick hesitate before nodding he assent
crowne pounce on it


something to add mr
merrick

i just do not think we should under
estimate they
especially the male


and i do not think we should panic
he caution merrick with a discreet look then shake a pill
from a bottle
crowne look forward to both man
very serious

gentleman whatever happen we need
t o keep one thing clearly in mind
as
far as the world at large go we be
just another medical service company
anything that alter that perception
put we at risk
and we cannot rely on
the sanction of the law to protect we
whenever and wherever and in whatever
condition we recover these product we
have to stay beyond reproach
all it
take be one nudge to put we in the
spotlight
then you will see how fast
politician can run for cover
merrick shift uneasy
sanger take the pill with a bitter smile


i n other word we need to find they
o r else
that be very astute ellen


the dust swirl and puff across a highway of yesteryear
dirt
track but for patch of expose concrete and angle of buckle
lamppost
the empty path reach to a bloodred sunset


the dust skim over mountain of rust scrap
nestle in the
mountain be a shack
sign creak in the breeze osmund e e be
license salvage merchant
on the porch sit an old man in a
greasy ballcap a n d dungaree
this be the eponymous owner
he be sitting on a loung surveying he empire enjoy a beer
and a cigarette
exhale a drag of smoke he eye crease to a
squint
he see something through the smoke silhouette against
the sunset
an approaching figure wary like a flighty animal


hello
the silhouette figure do not answer just stare back at he

can i help you
this seem to get a response
the figure venture closer
we
recognize lincoln
exhausted dustcovered and drythroated

i friend
she need water


mass of technology and furniture from recent and distant past
lincoln lower ester onto a threadbare sofa
ozzie excited to
have visitor bustle up with a water gallon pouring a glass
lincoln take it and tip it to ester lip
she cough it out
at first
then take the glass and start drink with vigor
ozzie set down the water gallon in front of he visitor
then
settle in an armchair and crack open a beer
it lend the mood
albeit strain of a social visit
lonely old ozzie wanting to
make it so
despite which both man have an eye on each other

get stick in that supercell didya
lincoln eye he wary of the question
ozzie read confusion

Supercellstorm that be what they call

ozzie chuckle to himself
it seem to put he visitor at ease

yep i hear it shut down some of the
lodeways

lincoln gulp down some water deciding an answer
then venture

away

w a y

the term be meaningless to lincoln but he like the sound of it
ozzie grin
this be starting to feel like a real social visit

o w where be i manner go

osmund r e a l l y
but folk call i ozzie
an awkward lull as ozzie wait for he visitor to reciprocate

o m e t i m e s i like to make a joke of it
i last name bein e e be



deer
z z i e chuckle but the pun seem lost on he visitor
he let we it
drop
the awkward silence return
lincoln drink the water
wonder if this strange old man be as harmless as he appear

we l l now look like you g i r l f r i e n d s
make herself at home
lincoln look at ester slump over asleep on the sofa
ozzie
put a finger to he lip beckoning he visitor out of the room


the porch light come on casting the scrapyard in grade of
light and shadow
ozzie step out onto the porch light a
cigarette
he visitor hovering at the threshold he offer the
pack
lincoln step out and take one
ozzie light it for he

you girlfriend sure be pretty
he visitor look at he curiously
ozzie misinterpret that
he be say something out of turn
time to change the subject

so what be with they tattoo huh
he tap he forehead
lincoln finger he crosshatch suddenly
aware of it now and suspicious of the question
ozzie palliates

hey in the eye of the beholder right

not look like much but you would be
surprise

lincoln look at he something breaking the cloud
sense of
danger indistinct
suddenly cautious he stub he cigarette

the woman still lie asleep on the sofa
the man be sitting
beside she armchair head bow seemingly plunge in thought
z z i e resume rummage to find a crumple delivery note
he
review it for a moment
then quickly clear away some more
paper to uncover a keypad device
it be known as a holocom
he tap a key and a holoframe resolve
then tap in some digit
from the delivery note
the holoframe snow with static
then a
crosshatch insignia appear spinning in

i take it you have hear the news


the bond agent
yes
unfortunate

unfortunate
we be way past unfortunate henry


i think we would covered ourselves

the police will not connect the bond
agent to we
but that be not the
problem
it be the sponsor


what be you talking about

the male agnate track he down

he name thomas lincoln
it seem
they have a genetic reunion
not a
h a p p y one
it be all i could do to
stop he going to the authority


i still do not see the problem

he may not want a police involvement
but he be already threatened to file
suit
and he be one of the big
litigation attorney in the city



that be why we have you ellen

that be why i ask bernard to come out
here
to find out how it happen

i told she henry
about synesthesia
a n g e r cast a betray look at merrick
then return to crowne


i t be a marginal problem
and it be
under control accord to bernard

that be not the point
whether or not
it be a factor in this instance it
put we in breach of the clone law


i t do not even touch they genetics

i be talking about selfawareness
the
virtual humanity statute require we
t o give they consciousness to the
l e v e l of functionality
but not beyond
this give sanger pause
crowne drag she cigarette acutely

e g a l l y we be naked on every level
federal legislature state licensing
sponsorship contract
but even if we
do manage to weather the legal storm
we would never survive the public scrutiny
a n g e r absorb this calmly shaking a pill from he pill bottle


i have spent i entire career facing down
naysayer ellen
do not think for a
second i be afraid of facing they now

you remember cryogenics
at the outset
people dismissed it as a rich mane
folly
eccentric millionaire freeze
they brain hope to wake up in a new
body


v e n when cloning show sign of
m a k i n g it feasible it be not moral
a f f r o n t that cause the backlash
it
w a s the scope
the scope henry
when
t h e size of the customer base be
e x p o s e d it scream inequality one
m e d i c i n e for the rich and one for the
p o o be
the pressure for accessible cryo
genics a s good as buried the industry
you r grave be be dig as we speak
g e n t l e m e n
every pass second they
g e t deeper
if we be going to survive
w e have to act swiftly and decisively


l r i g h t
what do you suggest
a n g e r dry swallow the pill
ellen open a contract folder

you r security chief i have be looking
at he file
Exmarine serve in south
china do we think he still have it in
he


r e you insane
the i r eye deadlock
crowne give merrick a sideways glance

you ever wonder why henry take
those pill bernard
why he do not
avail himself of he own technology


an agnate could give i a new heart
but to get it to function mentally

you l l s h i t henry
bullshit
you do not
want to deal with reality
only with
concept
i may not have be there at
the start but i hear the story
you
wanted in on every aspect of
construction from environmental
design right down to the classical
playlist
i t be not enough just to
make it work be it
no you wanted
you own little utopia


swan a r o you n d in you mountain
r e t r e a t like some selfappointed
d e i t y
but when it come to get
y o you r hand dirty


r e you quite finished

v e n god have blood on he hand henry
be you going to watch it all go up in
flame or be you going to deal with it


you see that street down there
running east from the stadium
i
father used to take i to church on
that street
an old spanish church

what be you point


i do not know they would torn it down





what do you give she

you s t something to help she sleep
i
think she have a bronchial infection
but i be not sure i should give she an
antibiotic in case it effect the baby

o you know about the baby


be n t that why you come here

i find you name in the listing
i
be not sure

the y have a plan
for woman like i

o you be the one who take she baby
katherine wince at he
it be utter so matteroffactly
she
pause hanging she head searching within herself

you know when you be young
how you
run around think you be immortal
lincoln s look say he have no idea
she seem not to notice

the r e be a lodeway accident
i be
damaged
after that i think no man
would ever want i
i be wrong
he
name be john
he said he married i
for i eye
ocean eye he called
they
he always loved the ocean
up
there on the wall that be johns boat
f f she gesture lincoln glance at the wall
watercolor of a
yacht
meaningless to he but katherine gaze it at fondly

but i think there be always an unspoken
regret between we
when we hear about
the technology it be like
forgive
n e s s like a second chance
child of
we own part of both of we
sail
trip fish trip so many plan
o h n get cancer a year ago
he die
he r eye mist distant and bittersweet talking to herself now

i r o n i c
that the same technology could
have saved he life
and now the baby
be the only part of he i have left
and the boat
i still have the boat
lincoln look discomfit
there be more to this than he think




i told you we should not have go to
outside personnel
they be cowboy

we have no choice karl
we have to keep
this away from the institute

an d now

what be this

you resignation paper
maybe early
retirement would be more accurate

e n platinum bounty if you sign the
paper they loss become you gain

parachute
so there be a jump

you understand that whatever happen
the institute must be able to deny it

we use a chemical to dispose of waste
product
it be called dihalcyonate
i t
react on a molecular level to start a
process of internal combustion
the
subject be incinerate from the inside
out
in postmortem application it be
do it job before rigor mortis
in a
live subject well
you can imagine


you want to dispose of you product

i t s a little more complicate than
that
we have to be very
thorough
if you still have it in you that be

why do you think i still wear this

i do not know

i be discharge from the marine for
insubordination
if you ask anyone
i n i unit they would call it heroism
i
disobey an order to fall back
i take
out a bunker complex singlehand

o you wear it be a badge of honor

o
it be not bravery
i be not afraid
of dying
i just do not care
you see
i suddenly realized i be just a sack
of flesh with a heartbeat
life death
i just could not see the point anymore

you will find a vehicle park outside
it be unregistered difficult to trace
i take it we have an agreement





what do i call you


lincoln
i name lincoln

lincoln i think she need professional
help
i think she need to see a doctor

o
they will find she
they will take she

o t if i do not want they to

you do not understand
they do not want
people to know about she
either of we

the doctor i be think of he be an
old friend
he look after john in
t h e final stage
i trust he

why
so you can take she baby

o
no that be not what i want
f f lincolns blunt look she sigh lowering into a chair

a y b e i do not realize she would be so
a y b e i just do not want to
either
way i be wrong
i want you to know
that
i be wrong
and i be sorry
heavy lull
lincoln hang he head remembering

the y make you believe there be a place
called the island

upstairs and put you to sleep
they
cut you open
they take piece of you
katherine look at he intuit
she allow a pause then

v e n if i have taken she baby i swear
to you i would never have
they give
you a choice you see to extend the
sponsorship after
after d e l i v e r y


o
i see a lot of we go to the island
but i never see anyone come back

sponsorship they would have
and keep
taking the money
