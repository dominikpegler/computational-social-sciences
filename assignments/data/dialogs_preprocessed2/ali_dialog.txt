the honorable elijah muhammad be i
spiritual guide

so i get nothing you want

i be going to be a people champion
but i do not have to be the way you
want i to be
i be going to be what i
want
and i be free to think any
way i want

i be leaving see the light
on
how come you be up

watchin a show on
termite
they knockin down this
house here


i be invited to speak at ibadan
university in nigeria
mon with i

six million in you house and you
do not know it
where

africa
you be there

africa
no
only rome
yeah man
let we go

nkrumah stay with i when he be
a student in new york so we will
stop in ghana

when we leaving

next thursday

what be it

you ever be so angry
have you
ever be so angry that you would explode

tear out a picture of emmett till
when i be little
could not take
i eye to it
could not look at it
Barbwire around he neck to a
pound cottongin fan
take out he
eye
the cruelty to it
i
could not look at it
could not
throw it away

what else


i think what i do wrong to be
so low that people could do that to
people like i
it make i feel
ashamed
and that make no sense
but that be what it be

when i hear about the four
girl bombed in the th street
church in birmingham
the prohibition of the honorable
elijah muhammad prevent i from
speaking i voice in action
because birmingham be part of the
civil right movement begging for
a place at the white mane table
but dead child
be dead
child
so the anger i feel i
have to contain
i locked that down
so tight i muscle seize
i lost
control over the right side of i
body
leg do not work
right arm
do not work
i be have a stroke
i think
i have to hold it in
because i wanted all i wanted be
to
break a
part
any part of this system
because you be so provoke as a
human being
in you spirit
in
you heart
at the death of
child
but i
nothing

putting he glass
back on
everyone know
now i be
advocate more direct political
action involvement with the
international struggle
so
elijah muhammad have suspended i as
a minister in the nation of islam
for day

you can fix that

i do not know
i will try when we
get back
until then i will live
each day as if i be already dead


only after long service and high
merit in the spiritual and physical
rebirth of AfroAmerican people
be
one grant an original name
but
you be special
world champion
so there be a gift i wish to give
you
from this day forward you
will be known as muhammad
ali
which mean one worthy of
praise and ali mean most high

islam now

fiduciary responsibility to this
first allblack promotion be like a
garden in the african sun

grow
it must bloom
it cannot
flower in the gloom and shade of
postponement to some dome
like
the astrodome the superdome any
