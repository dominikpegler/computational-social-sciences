going to get fired because craig have to pay
woman to fuck he


jesus
calm down
Nobodys get fired

i be great


man oh man
man oh man oh man

oh god

wow



i have always hear you entire life
flash in front of you eye the second
before you die



first of all that one second be not a
second at all it stretch on forever
like an ocean of time




for i it be lying on i back at boy
scout camp watch falling star



and yellow leave from the maple tree
that line i street



or i grandmother hand and the way
she skin seem like paper




and the first time i see i cousin Tonys
brand new firebird



and janie



and janie




and
carolyn




i guess i could be pretty pissed off
about what happen to i
but it be
hard to stay mad when there be so much
beauty in the world
sometimes i feel
like i be seeing it all at once and it be
too much i heart fill up like a
balloon that be about to burst



and then i remember to relax and stop
trying to hold on to it and then it
flow through i like rain and i can not
feel anything but gratitude for every
single moment of i stupid little life
you have no idea what i be talking about
i be sure
but do not worry




you will someday
