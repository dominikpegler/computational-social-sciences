i
find he head

i can not tell you how excite we
be to have you here

you only have one victim
usually
there be two or three by the time i
get called in

this case make page one of the
globe
the tabloid say there be
a headhunter on the loose


the mayor want closure
that be
he vacation house they be
build
i get call from

you clear the mayor

we clear the mayor
he read the
article on you in newsweek and
insist we fly you up
the
paper say two camper have a
drunken fight and the loser lost
he head

what do you think

i do not solve crime anymore i
balance budget

this be not a heat of the moment
kill
and the victim be
buried complete with head
the
grave be fivefoot ten
the
victim height
with square
corner
dig with a shovel the
killer have the foresight to bring

Thirtyfive detective search
the area saturday
i
investigator think you be a
witch

i have be called badly

jeez
look at that look like he
get icepicked


no
large canine do that
probably an old or sick timber
wolf that could not hunt
it dig
up the body and chewed off the
head
it feel safe in the tree
away from the riverbank away from
the other wolf

i would say you be right
postmortem scavenger damage to

the victim be afraid of dentist
bad tooth

this be a meter from the skull
at soil level

look at this

bingo
that be you murder weapon

it might be trash a camp left


no
look at it braid parachute
cord two piece of broom stick
you approach the victim from
behind loop it around he head
and hold on for all you might
the more the victim struggle the
quicker he pass out
and now
you have convenient handle to
drag around two hundred pound of
dead kayaker

that be a theory

that be exactly what it be

theory
that evidence support
when the suspect be in custody you
can ask he yourself what happen
and you will not need i
inspector

laval and reynaud be i star
very smart very persistent
investigator

we IDd the remain in the morgue
the real

richard hart



he be an addict
and a thief
an art thief
he hit gallery
in europe and north america
travel back and forth smuggling
and selling steal canvass


let i guess costa be selling
steal art for hart and never give
he the money
now hart be just
another one of Ashers victim

costa owe he eight thousand
those be Emails off harts
computer

go to hell
i will not pay you a

i be not scare of you



come and get i

you dumbass
asher taunt hart into a
confrontation
jesus
it be
right there in i face
i be
interpreting behavior from two
different suspect

he have we all fool grace
all
of we
if asher can do that what
else can he do

anything he want

ah the undertaker have arrive
for i career


have you right be explain to
you and have an indication to that
effect be make in you employee
record

yessir

agent Vanderholt
why would asher
kill ford if nobody know he be
costa
if he be not going to use
fords identity

he needed a murder he could link
not only richard hart to but also
to he past victim



harts behavior be consistent
with a disorganize drug addict
following the rule of the
criminal road by attempting to
kill a debtor who will not pay
he
have no idea he be be
manipulated by a serial killer




asher be not becoming disorganize
and decompose into madness he
be evolve



the ford murder be stage and i
missed it
asher drive fords car
there with ford unconscious in the
car
ether maybe
something
that disappear
asher work out
head to the park lot
pull
ford out of the trunk
and
strangle he
he left a couple
of harts hair on the body



he draw a nice portrait of mr
hart and he be now inside the heart
of montreal pds investigation




evidence at the ford crime scene
lead to an apartment with more of
harts
and evidence linking
hart to Ashers crime
hart
never set food in that apartment
asher stage everything



mr
hart not asher murdered the
montreal inspector correct



yes
hart think costa be
systematically destroy he
life
harts violent explosion
be inevitable



how could asher plan on hart
snap like that



he could not
i guess be asher
intended to kill hart and make it
look like suicide
the
authority would find the body
and close the martin asher file

but to recommend terminating you
