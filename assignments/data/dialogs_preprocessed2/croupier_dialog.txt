jack have decided
to see she
the challenge be
essential

come in

it be not the ritz this time

be it yes

yes

thank you

it do not seem fair
you be
offering i ten grand in cash but
you can not afford a decent place

well life not fair
we know
that

it be all relative
i need the
money too

do you

yes

the date not set yet
i will call
you
one last thing
the man you be
going to catch cheating he may

i have still get mine

and you hand too

i take the bandage off yesterday

would you like a drink

no thank you

i do not think we should meet again

it be a shame there be not more man
in the world like you

there be a part of jani he really
like

question
be he gambling taking
janis money
answer
no
because
he be not betting with he own
money
he be be paid in advance
for a service

in reality there be two clear
element of risk in this exchange
one
the possibility the cash be
counterfeit
two
the possibility
jani or she creditor would want
the money back if the plan failed

to begin with he put the odds at
against
for
he checked a random
selection of bill at a bank
they
be all good

so now he odds be decidedly
well
he put they at to
the
fact that the note be good give
he one less negative
minus
at the same time mathematically he
have one more positive
plus

bring i some luck

no more bet

next stage
he have to be secure at
to against have to give the
money back so he would not spend
it
if after one month no one have
approached he he calculate the
odds of keeping it at to
after three month he figure
to no one would turn up

how about a drink to celebrate

cash i in

jakes experiment with the man
would prove the point

people do not change

he watch they face as they
lose hour after hour night after
night relentlessly

he question the conventional
wisdom that gambler be self
destructive

he have come to believe that in
reality they want to destroy
everyone else they family and
love one everyone
fuck over
the whole world

without emotion he watch they
go
jake stay

it be set
the day after tomorrow
the twentyfourth
good luck

be not you ever tempt to gamble

never
why do you ask

i can just imagine be around
so much money all the time

Gamblings not about money

really

Gamblings about not facing reality
ignore the odds

i must be a fool
i never think
about the odds
