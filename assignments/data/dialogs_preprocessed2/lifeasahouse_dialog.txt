off

i think i be helping you

it would help i if i could kiss you

what you think you know do not have
much to do with reality
i mean i hope
i be not the first to say that about you

okay

okay
i guess

have you ever even kiss a girl

oh yuck

you be scrubbing the shower down

you must have a really great husband

why be that

just i mean well you be here every
single day

he be at work while i be here

i guess i would just be jealous if i be
he

well he do not need to worry

if i kid and i wife be always at an
exhusbands house i would worry

he be not the type to worry

let we eat

i would be glad to fix you something

no i be fine

nothing okay

enough for drink popcorn and candy

and video game after

home after
will you come in and say hi

do we have to take she

definitely

i should go

maybe you should not come everyday

no
why
i like to be with sam

it be just that there be less that adam and
ryan can do anymore
i would hate to have they bore

i know they be not much help but they
love coming here george

how much time do they get to spend with
they dad

what be it with this
they would not
spend less time with peter if they live
here
he have no time

do you know Alyssa think something be up
with we
she be giving i crap about
be away from peter and now you be
trying to do the same thing
what no one
seem to realize be that peter be not
there
he be not there
and when he be
he be not
so if you do not want i here or you
do not want i kid here just tell i
george
i will stop coming
but it will not
be because of peter
it will be because
you ask i to stop
say what you need
to say because i be not leaving until i
hear it

i would rather you not be here

i think we be helping

i can hire worker to help i

you can come in and wait if you would like

what friend do she go with

nothing be going on with we be it

go on

there be not a doubt in i
mind that through all i anger
i ego
i be faithful in i love for you
from
seventh grade on

that i make you doubt it that i withhold
it
that be the great mistake of a
life full of mistake
