no stop
i do not want it
you be dead inside all of you

no sane person
would choose to live in pain
forever

how be you feeling marcus

i be not sure i know how to describe it

it be called happiness
you have be
angry all you life

really fighting for be
death

in the world outside the
survivor think Skynet be the
enemy out to destroy they
why
do not you tell they about all this

not everyone can become like we
marcus
we just do not have the
resource to sustain more than a
few thousand hybrid

picked up taken here


boy and a girl in the last day
or two

valley of the shadow of death



i shall fear no evil

have a reason for live
