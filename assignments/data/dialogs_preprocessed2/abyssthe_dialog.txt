the kremlin continue to deny russian
involvement in the sink of the trident sub
montana
the navy have not released the name
of the crewmember who be all presume
dead at this time
civilian employee of a
benthic petroleum offshore drill rig

hey that be we

operation but we have little information about
they involvement
on the scene now be


we want name

hey hey

there be a tremendous amount of activity
with cuba only mile away the massive buildup
of ship and aircraft in the area have draw
official protest from havana and moscow and have
lead to a redirection of soviet warship into the
caribbean theater

how would you describe the mood there

the mood be one of suspicion even confrontation
number of russian and cuban trawler
undoubtedly surveillance vessel have be
circling within a few mile throughout the day
and soviet aircraft have repeatedly be warn
away from the area

this suck

what be the matter with you

now we be right in the middle of this bigtime
international incident
like the cuban missile
crisis or something

figure that out for yourself do you

we get russian sub creeping around
shit
something go wrong they could say anything
happen down here man

little be known at this hour about the event
leading up to the collision
the navy guided
missile cruiser appleton apparently strike the
soviet Udaloy class destroyer in low visibility
condition



in violent sea little hope remains for over a
hundred russian crewman still missing after the
sink an hour ago

soviet military spokesman have claim that
the collision constituted an unprovoked attack
this be denied

bud this be big time


separation sequencer disconnect
next

remove explosive bolt one through six in
counterclockwise sequence

check

what can anyone do

hey they do not want war any more than we do
you think about it you say
