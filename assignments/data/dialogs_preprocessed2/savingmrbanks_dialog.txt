be a mother be a job
very
difficult job and one that not
everybody be up to that not
everybody should have taken on in
the first place

i will have she called cynthia

i dad elias disney he owned a
newspaper delivery route there
thousand paper
twice daily
morning and evening edition
elias
he be a tough businessman
save
apenny anywhere you can type of
fella so he would not employ any
delivery boy he just used i and
i big brother roy
i be eight
then eight year old
like i said those winter be
harsh and old elias do not believe
in new shoe until the old one
be worn right through so
honestly mrs travers the snow
would be up to here

you would push through it like wading
through molasses

and the cold and the wet would be
seeping through the shoe and the
skin would be raw and peeling from
we face and sometimes i would find
myself sunk down in the snow
waking up cuz i must have passed out
for a moment i dunno
then
school too cold to figure out an
equation
and back into the snow so
by the time we get home it would be
just get dark and every part
of you would sting like crazy as it
slowly come back to life in the
warmth
i mother would feed we
dinner and then it would be time to go
out again for the evening edition
good be quick walt good be quick
or poppa going to show you the
buckle end again boy

make you sad mrs travers i do not
