forever





it be really hard to leave a show
like gilmore girl but i really
believe in gavin




the only way we can afford to shoot
the pilot be in canada


it be really hard to think about
leaving for six week


action





gavin taylor
creator Showrunner



gavin unlock the door enter from the driveway
he be
haul a massive wheel duffle bag
note

same house from part one

we hear the of toenail on hardwood floor
gavin

Puggies
gavins pounce all over he



gavin be on the cordless phone talking with a friend as he
sort through massive pile of mail
on he leave wrist we notice the same green string bracelet
gary wear in part one

feel like i house anymore



gavin sit at the piano pecking out a haunt melody he be
be fiddling with
he grab a red diskette and a sharpie



at this stage you have the script
you write and the film you shoot
but you do not know how it be all
going to come together
you just
know how you want it to feel
he write knowing on the diskette and pop it into the
Disclavier unit



susan gavin and the watch the cut
susan be taking
note on a legal pad

susan flip to she next note
list she position as


i just do not know if you need the
cold open
people want to get
right to the story


i invited susan to see a rough cut
because i trust she taste

could we be more clear why mary be
so freak out at that moment

wow
i think it be pretty
obvious
and dramatic

more importantly i trust she as a
barometer of rogers taste

i know
but that be rogers big
thing this season
never let the
audience be confuse



so we be trying to squeeze in a
wild line over this shot of noelle

melissas character look alarm by something the girl have
just do or said

what be the line

how could you

Howkajew

yeah

Howkajew
it sound like kosher
drug paraphernalia
like come on
Shmuley
have a toke on the
Howkajew

i know
it be just for the test
screen

they really think people will not get
it

the dumb people might not

i do not think we be making the
show for dumb people
beat

melissa hold a microphone
as video footage play back we hear three evenlyspaced

where the fourth one would be melissa say
the line

Howkajew
how could you
how couldjew
finish she hand the mic back to gavin


i feel so dirty

that be how i like you





that guy looking at i

he can not see you

how about you
do you feel it
be

it be not real

and what do you mean by that


the show not real
why can not you
see that
jesus
be you fuck
blind
you think you be above it all
do not you
you be trapped here
with the rest of they brother

get out
get out
Oblivio
accebit



the guy be crazy
obviously
the
show be kinda twist and it just
flip something in he



what do he say

Oblivio accebit
it be latin
oblivion approach




what do you think it means

other than the world be coming to
an end
Oblivio also mean
forget forgetfulness
i think that be what i be going to
do
forget it






do you have a chance to look at
the card yet

from the screen

pardon i
daddy need he drink



woman where be i cocktail

i be acomin
i still love you most

people write stuff on the card
they will not say in a focus group
they get more specific

roger have this advice i always
remember


forget about anyone who score you
in the twos and threes
they will
never like you show

instead look for the nines

the nines

they be the one who think you show
be almost the good thing they have
ever see
they get you vision
they just want it to be even
well

round two be starting without you

so you will look at the card

absolutely




sometimes the number point thing
out that you do not want to admit to
yourself
in this case melissa


she overall score be okay
but
if you look at the people who
score the show high the one
consistent dip be melissa



she do not have a ton to do in the
pilot
there be so much to set up
you do not get a lot of melissa
time

true
that be one of the challenge
with a premise pilot

but the network still like the
show

of course
roger be you big
cheerleader

how about above roger

roger call the shot

after he consult with the high
power

true

do they like the show

they have not see it
they be
watch all the pilot on friday

why be you focus on melissa


because she be the big concern

she be also the big star in the
show

no you be the big star
roger
make a huge deal with you and he
go along with casting melissa
when that be not he instinct

well hooray for roger
i do not
understand what you want i to do

meet with someone

who

dahlia salem
gavin drop he fork so that it will on he plate

the network have a hold deal with
she

yes
and you put she in Gatins
pilot

it be dead
it be die
but the
network love dahlia
so if she
could jump over to you show

replace melissa and reshoot the
pilot

roger would pay for it
gavin be nauseous
he have to take a drink to be able to
speak

so be this even about melissa


it be about get you show on the
air
that be all that matter in
the end





i see why the network love she
it be just i write the part for
melissa
she be one of i good
friend
and in i head i only
see melissa for the role
could dahlia do it
absolutely
it could work
i just do not know
if i want it to work



when i get stressed out i play
videogames
it be i therapy
i
can not have they on i own computer
because then i would never write
so i
come down to Koreatown


Videogames be good than real
life
when you get stick you can
always hit reset
life need a
reset button


if we be really going to replace
melissa i want to hear it from
roger


rogers on a flight to london
but
i talk with he before he left
he said yes on dahlia

what do that mean

it mean yes

yes replace melissa

he want you show on the air
starring dahlia
i just get off
the phone with she agent
they
love it
she love you

what about melissa

you want i to call she agent

god no
i will tell she





as long as he need i i know where i
must be

inbetween the pilot and the
series i be trying to squeeze in a
onewoman show
i have always be obsess with
nun
they be sort of like god
faghags



i think i house be haunted

you house be really old


ever since i get back i
feel like there be someone else
there
and then last night i
think i hear something
woman
sing

shit
like a ghost


i guess
and then i see something
i run into someone

the woman

it be a man
i think it be i
beat while melissa process

you house be haunted by yourself

yeah

gavin be you alright

no
no
he take a long beat psych himself up
what spill out
be heartfelt but clearly rehearse

the network want to replace you

oh i god

and i be letting they because i
really want the show on the air
i
have all these character inside i
head and they want to live
i be
the only way they can
this be the
only way they can
i have five
season map out and though it
suck either you go away or the
show go
i have to make a
decision and that be the decision i
make
i be sorry
by the end of it we can hear the emotion in he voice
melissa take a beat to process

so it be do
finish
decide

yes


i understand
it be not you fault
you be morally incapable of do
the right thing
gavin do not rise to the challenge

do not get i wrong
i think you do
feel bad for i
but that be all
you feel for i
you still see i
as the fat girl you call on friday
night when a date fall through
let we go to a movie
let we go to
Fubar
and if you meet a hot piece
of ass do not worry about melissa
you can apologize tomorrow
or
do not
same difference
it be not
like we be actually friend

i do not want to do this on camera

Upfronts be the week each year when

gavin look leave where an AfricanAmerican woman be waiting
for the same crosswalk
we recognize she as octavia the
streetwalker from part one


i be fine

who be you talking to
gavin look back towards camera a strange expression

we see gavin and the woman on the corner
there be no camera
gavin could have be talking to
he be understandably
perplex
where do the documentary crew go
be there ever anyone there
we style have changed
instead of handheld and jerky
we be smooth and slow
the have completely changed underscore a sense of
creep dread
we for a long beat
the light change
still a little
unnerve octavia begin to cross the street
only then do we notice something unusual floating above she
head

we see that everyone on the street have the same kind
of sphere floating a foot above they head
no one seem to
see the light other than gavin
gavin look around in uneasy fascination as if he be just
landed on an alien world
beat then he have an unsettle thought
he slowly look up
above he own head he see the same
sphere of light only his be bright white
pulsing
blinding

oh god

we to a perspective above and behind
gavin
as we do the edge of the frame creep in revealing
and unintelligible changing moment by
moment
dialog box appear in the center of the screen read
exit now
Unsaved change will be lost

an arrow slide back and forth between to the two option
finally it land on exit




x x


we be continuing an early scene from the end of part one

i can understand why you be a
little confuse

no
i be a lot confuse

theory

this be all a dream

no

i be in a coma

no

then i be dead
this be hell or
Purgatorium or something


okay a purgatorium be where roman
vomit
but no
this be as real
as anything can be

what do that mean
she sit forward in she chair
by instinct he sit back

everything be what it be
but
you be not who you think you be

okay then
who be i
with practiced calm

you be a multidimensional being of
vast almost infinite power
you
created this world on a whim and
decided to stick around to see how
it turned out
you this body
you be in be just one of you
incarnation
avatar
call you
what you will
not sure he follow

be you saying i be god

technically no
if god be a ten
a theoretical ultimate thatwhich
nogreatercanbeimagined
you be more of a nine

so what be you

human be sevens
monkey be
sixes

what be the eights

koala
they be telepathic
plus
they control the weather
she do not mean to get on that tangent


what be important be that you
you be the big cheese
el supremo
you could destroy the world with a
single thought
do not incidentally
just file
that away
but the truth be you
hold all the card
every church
every candle every sacrifice
that be for you
when people pray
they be not praying because they
want this thing or that thing
they just do not want to be
forgotten

so you understand i would have
told you early but i do not

yeah

okay

i understand
but i do not believe

around he leave wrist
and in that moment a film pass over he like the boundary
between water and air

mary be frozen with the same smile on she face but we notice
that she and the kitchen around she have flattened out to two
dimensional image
she and everything around she have become like wallpaper
slowly curling away reveal emptiness beneath
gabriel collapse into a single spiky sphere of light
the light move through the kitchen create wave that
ripple through the tissuethin wall
pick up speed the sphere rush through the window
head west
