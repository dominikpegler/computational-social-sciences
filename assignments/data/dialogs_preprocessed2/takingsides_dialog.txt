experience
soon after i joined

the eroica
there be several rather
difficult passage for the timpani
one particular crescendo
during
the break i ask how he wanted

score
he do not look up
he said
just watch i
so of course i
do
i never stopped watch he
the moment come
and suddenly he
turned to i and we eye be
locked
there be something in his
look that
that simply demand
the crescendo
i shall never forget
he look
it be a moment of
of
magic

you ever see adolf hitlers eye
when he be making a speech
i have
see they on film

yes

be looking at furtwangler like
that

i do not know what you mean major

when you get to the crescendo

you think a whole orchestra what
a hundred and forty or so guy
could be orchestrate

i guess it be possible

so what do the Russki want

to see you

dr
furtwangler

i do not hear anyone invite you to
sit down

sit there

i want you to understand why you be
here
you be automatically banned
from public life under control
council directive no
we be
here to look into you case before
you appear in front of the tribunal
for artist of the denazification
commission
you understand that

i have already be clear by a
denazification tribunal in austria

what they do in austria do not
interest i one little bit
okay
i have you questionnaire here
gustav heinrich ernst martin wilhelm
furtwangler born berlin january

orchestral conductor
and
you say here you be never a member
of the nazi party

that be correct

could you tell we about be make
a prussian privy councillor
how
do that happen to a nonParty
member

i received a telegram from hermann
goering informing i that he have
make i a privy councillor
i be
not given the opportunity either
to accept or refuse
after the
dreadful event of november
the violent attack on the jew i
stopped use the title

what about VicePresident of the
chamber of music you used that
title do not you
but then i suppose
you have no choice there either
because i suppose dr
goebbels
just send you a telegram saying
dear mr
VicePresident

i do not think dr
goebbels send i
a telegram
i be simply tell
in
a letter i believe
i do not
remember exactly

goebbels and goering be sure
heap honour on you
one make
you a privy councillor the other
make you VicePresident of the
chamber of music and you be not
even a member of the party how do
you explain that

well there be a constant battle
between goering and goebbels as to
which of they would control german
culture
i be simply a pawn
anyway i resigned from the
Musikkammer at the same time i
resigned as musical director of
the berlin philharmonic orchestra
in

why be that
why do you resign
dr
furtwangler

i write an open letter to the
newspaper condemn what they
be do to music making these
distinction between jew and non
jew
for i part the only divide
in art be between good and bad
eventually goebbels summon i
and told i i could leave the
country if i wanted to but under
no condition would i ever be allow
to return
i always believe that
you have to fight from the inside
not from without
i ask myself
what be the duty of an artist to
stay or to leave
and then goebbels
demanded that i acknowledge hitler
as solely responsible for cultural
policy
well that be a fact and
it seem pointless to deny it
i
simply acknowledged that hitler
and the minister of culture
appointed by he be solely
responsible for the cultural policy
of the reich
what i wanted to
express be that i personally
have no responsibility whatsoever
for they cultural policy
i have
always have the view that art and
politics should
should have
nothing to do with each other

then why do you conduct at one of
they nuremberg rally

i do not conduct at at the rally
i conduct on the evening before
the rally

that sound like the small print
in one of we insurance policy
wilhelm
and what about april

the eve of hitlers fifty
third birthday the big celebration
you conduct for hitler do not
you
be that in keeping with you
view that art and politics have
nothing to do with each other

that
that be a different matter
i
i be tricked

how come

could i have a glass of water
please
please fraulein

Straube

thank you
i be in vienna
rehearse the ninth symphony of
beethoven when goebbels called
and said i have to conduct at
hitlers birthday
i would always
managed to wriggle out of such
invitation plead previous
engagement illness have i
doctor state i be not well and
so on and so on
i be also
fortunate that baldur von Shirach
who controlled vienna hated dr
goebbels and would do anything to
thwart he wish
but this time
goebbels get to i doctor before
i
they be frighten off and
von schirach be threatened bully
and give in
so i have no
alternative but to conduct for
hitler
believe i i know i have
compromise and i deeply regret
it

do not sound much of a trick to
i
sound like you make a deal

i make no deal

i do not buy that

it be the truth

i keep hearing you helped a lot of
jew to escape
how do you do
that

i do not remember in detail there
be so many

do you call someone you know

i may have as
as i said i
simply do not remember

let i i help you then
you picked
up the phone and make a call
mime a telephone

hello adolf
wilhelm speak
listen old pal there be a Jewboy
musician i want you to help
he
need a permit to get to paris


or maybe you called goebbels or
goering
you be so close you
be in the same shithouse as they

may i ask a question

sure

when will i case be hear by the
tribunal

you guess be as good as mine

i need to work
i need to make i
live
i live off the generosity
of friend

tough tough

now more and more
agitated
then why be it please that another
conductor who be actually a member
of the party who used to play the
horst wessel before he concert
have already be clear and be
working again while i have to wait
and wait and wait

i do not know he be not i case
why do you escape to switzerland
just before the war end

it be because i learned that the
gestapo be about to arrest i

why be they going to arrest you

i believe it be because of another
letter i would written to goebbels
lament the decline of musical
standard due to racial policy

you do not complain about the racial
policy just about the musical
standard be that right

so how do you learn that the
gestapo be out to get you

during an enforce hourlong
interval because of a power failure
at a concert here in berlin albert
speer the minister of armament
said to i you look very tire
dr
furtwangler you should go
abroad for a while
i know exactly
what he mean

you sure know a lot of people in
high place

it would be true to say i think
that a lot of people in high place
know i

you be real close to all of they
to adolf to hermann to joseph
to baldur and now albert
so let we hear the truth let we
come clean
what be you party
number

if you be going to bully i like
this major you have well do
you homework
you obviously have
no idea how impertinent and stupid
you question be

david you remember i said i have a
question that he would not be able
to answer
well i be going to ask it
now
you ready for this wilhelm
it be a tough one
why do not you
get out right at the start when
hitler come to power in
why
do not you leave germany

yeah

furtwangler send hitler a telegram
for he birthday

he do

one of you people told i

one of i people

yes
corporal
army
jew
he said he would see the telegram in
the chancellery

Sonofagun
we will find the
corporal and we will find the
telegram

but i need documentary proof
you
know of anything like that

no
but that be why we hated he
we admire he as a conductor but
we all hated he too because he
do not have to join the party and
yet he have a good life than any
of we
he do not have to go and
deliver a report after every trip
abroad
he get everything from
they everything
he be filthy
than any of we party member

there be a rumour
i do not know
if it be true or not
but ask he
about von der null

never hear of he who be he

edwin von der null
music critic
he give furtwangler terrible review
while he rave about herbert von
karajan

who be he

also a conductor
very brilliant
young
von der null called he
the miracle von karajan
furtwangler be outraged and they
say he have von der null conscript
into the army
the same thing
happen to another critic
true
or not it be not such a bad idea
critic give you bad review you
have they send to the russian front
Chuckks

but if you really want to get
furtwangler ask he about herbert
von karajan

the miracle kid

yes yes you may notice that he
cannot even bring himself to utter
his name he
he refer to he
as

and ask he about he private life

he private life

yes it be all in here
he woman



where do you stand on all this

on all what

on furtwangler

i do not know

you represent the united states
now
we have a moral duty to be
just and we have to be see to be
just

major arnold believe he have a
moral duty too

we duty be to help furtwangler
with he defence
that be why i want you to look at
this
he select paper
from the table

these be part of the transcript
of the trial at nuremberg
we can not
get they translated fast enough
but i guess you understand german
right

that be the evidence of a guy named
dahlerus
he be a swede
friend of
hermann goering
i want you to
study it
and i want you to use
it

we be going to find more stuff to
feed you
we will have some other
suggestion
we need to build a
case for the defence base not
on feeling not on prejudice but
on fact

lieutenant wills

herr schlee timpanist herr romer
cello and herr schmidt viola
they be will to help
we have
already ordered ourselves coffee
i hope you

yeah of course

the whole orchestra will vouch for
he
he be always there to support
we

we need name if possible with
address because it be urgent
name of musician saved by dr
furtwangler people he helped to
escape abroad
let we go somewhere
public

to cooperation

i be in vienna
i have with i an
austrian chauffeur max he name
be he spent time in the camp
we be looking at these viennese
cleaning up the bomb damage
scavenging for rot food butt
end anything
i said to think
a million of these people come out
to welcome adolf on the day he
enter the city a million of
they and now look at they
and
max said oh not these people
major
these people be all at
home hide jew in they attic

you get the point colonel
the
point be they be all full of shit

Furtwanglers in a different
category

we be dealing with degenerate
here

degenerate

great artist will have great
privilege in a russian zone

that be why he do not get the hell
out of here when he have the chance
i put that to he he could not
answer
why do not he go and direct
in america like that italian
toscanini

perhaps
perhaps he believe he
could at least try to preserve
something important thing like
an orchestra a school
that be his
country
maybe he have an old mother
who can not be left alone
maybe he
have brother sister
you
can not

colonel
he have no sister no
brother only a lot of love
affair

anyway major why should he leave
he country he mother tongue
he family he history he past
he future just because now
suddenly there be a dictatorship
why

but what
before that turn
rotten
what if they surround
the space with barbed wire colonel

do not talk about thing you know
nothing about
he be in a
dictatorship

yeah yeah art and politics yeah
yeah i hear all about that

in a dictatorship art belong to
the party
if you want to be a
conductor you have to have an
orchestra
and you can only get an
orchestra if you have contact with
the power
all over the world you
need the right contact and you
have to make the right compromise

this be what i be saying
he must
have have party contact

there be good party member who
help and there be dirty nonparty
member who inform on you
of
course they give he privilege

and suddenly steve suddenly you
notice that they like you
they
honour you suddenly you be the
director of the good museum in the
world for example

what museum

i be sorry
museum
not
i said
orchestra
sorry
believe i
another sudden
change of mood to
earnest intimate
help i steve
you say you answer
for someone from high up
i too
have order from high up
very
high up
we want furtwangler
i will
give you in return the whole
orchestra four five conductor

flower you will see some mighty
pretty scenery do not let it fool

the
nazi party may be go but nazi
think nazi train and nazi
trickery remain
somewhere in this
germany be two million exNazi
official
out of power but still
in there and think think
about next time
remember that
only yesterday every business
every profession be part of
hitlers system
practically every
german be part of the nazi network
they believe they be born to be
master
do not argue with they
you be not be send germany as
educator
you be a soldier on
guard
you will observe they local
law respect they costume and
religion and you will respect they
property right
you will not be
friendly
you will be aloof
watchful and suspicious

yesterday i read that furtwangler
be ask to lead the new york
philharmonic back in toscanini
suggested it
have he accepted he
would have become the most
celebrate conductor in america

when he make he decision he
could not have known everything
especially not the way people like
you do who have return from exile
and feel that you have a right to
pass judgement
because you be
blameless you think you know best
who be a sinner and who deserve
forgiveness
but you have no idea
how people live here

when he meet hitler at he birthday
and shake hand with he be he
please

i do not know
but you and i already
know that he have saved live

Bruckners seventh major

do you know where the adagio begin

of course

put it on ready to play and i will
tell you when to play it

it be now nine of the clock precisely

violinist

room
miss Straube will come and
get you when i be ready to see
you

jesus god who the hell do he
think he be
who the hell do he
think he be

would you perhaps like to have a
glass of water herr professor

what be this man do here

dr
furtwangler
come in come
in sit down

no no take this one it be more
comfortable

if it be too hot open you tie

i wish to say something

go ahead be i guest

when i last see you i be
unprepared
i do not know what to
expect
in these past week i
have be think more carefully
and making some note
glance at the
note

you have to understand who i be
and what i be
i be a musician and
i believe in music
i be an artist
and i believe in art
art in
general and music in particular
have for i mystical power which
nurture mane spiritual need
i
must confess however to be
extremely naive
i insist for
many year on the absolute
separation of art and politics
i
entire life be devote to music
because and this be very important
because i think that i could
through music do something
practical

and what be that

maintain liberty humanity and
justice

gee that be a thing of beauty
honest to god a real thing of
beauty
i be going to try to remember
that
liberty humanity and justice
beautiful
but you used the word
naive
be you now saying you
think you be wrong
that art and
politics can not be separated

i believe art and politics should
be separate but that they be not
keep separate i learned to i cost

and when do you first learn that
when you send the telegram
be
that the surrender signal the
waving of the white flag

what telegram

happy birthday dear adolf love
wilhelm
or word to that effect
that sound to i like you be
dropping on you knee and saying
okay adolf you win
you be the
number one man
have a swell party


i have no idea what you be talking
about

the birthday greeting you send to
you old pal adolf Hider

i never send he any birthday
greeting or any other kind of
greeting

think carefully wilhelm
maybe
not in you own name but as privy
councillor or VicePresident

i do not have to think carefully
this be utterly ridiculous

yes david

why not show dr
furtwangler the
evidence
it may refresh he memory

you will not find it because no such
telegram exist

well i tried you get to admit i
tried
i think i might just trap
you there wilhelm but david here
be too quick for i
smart move
david smart move
no i do not
have the telegram but i know it
exist
and i want you to know
wilhelm we be going to keep looking
for it because i believe you send
it

then you be wrong

art and politics yeah art and
politics
let we look at that
you
and the berlin philharmonic tour
the third reich play in country
the nazi have conquer
be you
saying that conducting in occupy
territory from on be not a
commercial for adolf and all he
stand for

we never never officially
represent the regime when we
play abroad
we always perform
as a private ensemble
as i think
i already told you i be a
freelance conductor

you know something
you should have
written we insurance policy for
we because you get more exclusion
clause than double indemnity
what do you imagine people thought
the berlin Philharmonics taken
over by doctor goebbels and he
propaganda ministry but wilhelm be
a freelance so art and politics
be now entirely separate
be that
what you believe ordinary people
thought

have no idea what ordinary people
thought

no

no because i have only one
intention
i only intention
whatever i do be to show that
music mean more than politics

tell i about von der null

von der null

yes von der null

von der null

how longes this going to go on
wilhelm
i say von der null you
say von der null i say von der
null you say von der null we
could go on all day
you know who
von der null be do not you
edwin
von der Nuell music critic

yes i know who he be

be not it true that because he give
you bad review and praise this
young guy von karajan called he
a goddamn miracle said he be a
good conductor than you then
you have von der null conscript
into the army and no one hear
from he since

that be an outrageous lie

you sure you do not call one of
you close buddy and say god in
heaven do you see what that guy
von der null write about i
the
great conductor on earth
i
want he out the way
he have the
nerve to accuse i i be not playing
enough modern music
send he to
stalingrad
be not that what you
do
you do not like criticism do
you wilhelm
you surely do not
like they saying there be another
conductor who be good than you
be you saying the name von der
null be never mention in you
talk with goebbels

well
once he said he would read what
this man write about i

and what do he say

he said do not mind he
he job
be to criticise you job be to
conduct


and what happen to von der nul

i have no idea

you have really no idea
i will tell
you what happen
he die in
stalingrad

i be sorry

now that young conductor what be
he name
playing with
furtwangler
that miracle kid you know who i
mean
von karajan
but you called
he something else
mon
what
do you call von karajan

say it

i will say it then
little
be
that right
you could not even bear
to say he name

please stop playing these game
with i
why you should bring up
the name of another conductor be
beyond i understand

i will tell you why
you remember we
talk about you playing for
hitlers birthday
and you told
i that goebbels get to you doctor
first that you be tricked

yes that be what happen

i have a different story to tell
i do not think you be tricked
not in the way you describe
i
believe something else happen
i have see the Hinkel archive i have
see record of phone call and
putting it all together this be
what i think happen
i think
goebbels said wilhelm if you
will not conduct for Adolfs birthday
we will get the miracle kid the guy
that critic von der null think
be the great conductor in the
world
he be not just will to
conduct for adolf he be offered to
sing happy birthday as a solo


come on admit it
worried you
do not he
he always worried you
in he be thirtyfour year
old you be already fiftysix
and
goebbels and goering keep saying
to you if you do not do it little
will
never mind art and politics
and symbol and airyfairy bullshit
about liberty humanity and justice
because i do not care how great you
be
it be the old story in the
book
the age romeo jealous of the
young buck
the real reason you
do not leave the country when you
know you should have be that you
be frighten that once you
be out of the way you would be
supplant by the miracle kid the
Partys boy twice over flashy
talented little

this be absolute nonsense

well i be just beginning to develop
i theme
be not that what you call
it in classical music developing
you theme
okay so they play
on you insecurity
that be human
understandable
but there be one
guy who do not like little as
much as he like you yeah the
number one man you old pal adolf
he think you be the great and
when he say i want wilhelm for
i birthday boy they well go
out get wilhelm
so josef call
and threaten you with little
and you said to hell with the ninth
in vienna i will give it to adolf
as a birthday present in berlin
that be the trick they play they
get you by the ball and they
squeezed
hard
why do you stay
why do you play for they
why
be you the flagcarrier for they
regime
jealousy

of course there be a conspiracy
against i a campaign even
abroad

you see wilhelm i be talking about
ordinary everyday reason
which
be why i want to discuss you
private life
how many illegitimate
child do you have

major i do not see how this line
of questioning could

david what be you counsel for
the defence now

do you hear the question

i have illegitimate child

what

i said i have illegitimate child
i do not know how many

you like the woman do not you
wilhelm

be not it true that before every
concert you get a woman in you
dressing room and give she the old
conductor baton be not that true

major this be deeply offensive
and repugnant

you bet

and totally irrelevant

continuing to
furtwangler
not so counsellor
that secretary
of yours she be not just you
secretary she procure woman for
you do not she
as many and as
often as you wanted

stop this please stop this now

no i be not going to stop it
hitler
himself offered you a beautiful
house and a personal bomb shelter

i absolutely refused the house and
the bomb shelter

but you see what i be get at
you get a gorgeous house you be
highly paid
what be you going to
do stay or leave
one voice come
back at i
stay

major that be not a good argument
if dr
furtwangler do indeed enjoy
all these
these privilege he
enjoy they because of who he be
and what he be
that be true of any
lead artist in any country in
the world

but it still do not make they
saint
they still have to get up
and piss in the middle of the night
do not they
they can still be
vindictive and envious and mean
just like you and i
well just
like i
can not they

okay wilhelm go home now
go

of paper

i have thing here you said and
write
listen to this
the jew
composer schonberg be admire by
the jewish international
and
what about this
jewish musician
lack a genuine affinity with we
music
jewish musician be good
businessman with few scruple
lacking root
you deny you said
these thing

those attitude do not exist in
i

i believe that
but just answer
the question do not give i
explanation

speaking to party member i used
they language of course i do
everyone do

major sorry to interrupt but
maybe we have to
maybe we have
to balance those thing against
he assistance to he jewish
colleague

this be a transcript of the
proceeding at nuremberg
swedish businessman birger
dahlerus testify in cross
examination that he have several
meeting with hermann goering
i
first see goering dahlerus
testify embroiled in a stormy
interview with wilhelm furtwangler
the famous conductor of the berlin
philharmonic who be vainly seeking
permission to keep he jewish
concert master

Emmi pick one of these any one
read it out loud

please remember that dr
furtwangler risk he life to
help anyone who ask he
i
personally testify to have see
literally hundreds of people lined
up outside he dressing room after
concert to ask for he help
he
never turned anyone away
after he
hear i play
i be a violinist
he give i money because i be
unable to feed myself or i family
and then he helped i to escape to
sweden
he helped countless people
in similar way


and this only one of these letter
major
i have lots of they

how many time have i get to tell
you i be in insurance
you think
i can not smell a phoney policy when
it be shove under i nose
sure
he helped jew but that be just
insurance he cover because all
the while he be maestro of all he
survey
turning on
furtwangler
see wilhelm i think you be they
boy they creature
you be like
an advertise slogan for they
this be what we produce the
great conductor in the world
and you go along with it
the
truth of the matter be wilhelm
you do not need to be a member of
the party
i make a mistake when i
ask you for you party number
i
should have ask you for you non
party number
just like some other
wellknown artist
Emmi put that record on

do you know what that be

of course i know what that be

okay so what be it

Bruckners seventh
the adagio

who be conducting

i be

you know the last time it be play
on these air wave

how can i know such a thing

i will tell you then
the last time
this music be play on these air
wave be after they announce
that you pal hitler have shoot
himself
listen to it
they listen
do they pick little ks recording
do they pick some other conductor
no they picked you and why
because you represent they so
beautifully
when the devil die
they wanted he bandleader to
conduct the funeral march
you
be everything to they

near to breakdown
but struggling for
control
i have always tried to analyse
myself carefully and closely
in
staying here i believe i walk
a tightrope between exile and the
gallows
you seem to be blame i
for not have allow myself to
be hang

i do not directly oppose the party
because i told myself that be
not i job
if i have taken any
active part in politics i could
not have remain here
but as a
musician i be more than a citizen
i be a citizen of this country in
that eternal sense to which the
genius of great music testify
i
know that a single performance of
a great masterpiece be a strong
and more vital negation of the
spirit of buchenwald and auschwitz
than word

have you ever smell burn flesh
i smell it four mile away
four
mile away i smell it
have you
ever see the gas chamber the
crematorium
have you see the mound
of rot corpse
you talk to i
about culture art and music
you
putting that in the scale wilhelm
you setting culture art and music
against the millions put to death
by you pal
they have orchestra
in the camp
they play beethoven
wagner
the hangman be playing
chamber music at home with they
family
i do not understand the
german relationship with music
what do you need music for
you
pal you could call to save a few
jew when millions of they be
be annihilate
yes i blame
you for not get hang i blame
you for you cowardice
you strut
and swagger you fuck piece
of shit kingpin in a shithouse
you talk to i about walking a
tightrope between exile and the
gallows and i say to you lie

i love i country i believe in
music what be i to do

look around you
see the country
you serve
look at people who have
real courage who take risk who
risk they live
like Emmis
father

Emmi take you finger out of
you ear

i be talking about you father

i father only joined the plot
when he realise that we could not
win the war
she cry quietly

what kind of a world do you want
major

going to make
do you honestly
believe that the only reality be
the material world so you will be
left nothing nothing but
feculence
more foulsmelling
than that which pervade you
night

to know what they be capable of
no one know

but sure as hell we can give he a
hard time

hey turn that down would you
can not you see i be on the phone
never mind we get a journalist
who will do whatever we tell he

turn it off

we hand wilhelm furtwangler over
to the civil authority and he
be charged with serving the nazi
regime with utter antisemitic
slur performing at an official
nazi party function and with be
a prussian privy councillor
dr
furtwangler be acquitted

but i sure winge he
and i know i do the right thing
furtwangler resume he career but
he be never allow to conduct in
the united states
he die in
little succeed he as head of
the berlin philharmonic
