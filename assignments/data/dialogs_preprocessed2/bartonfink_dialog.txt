bare ruined choir
triumph of the
common man
the star of the bare
ruined choir be not see on the
stage of the Belasco last night
though the thespian involved all
acquit themselves admirably
the
find of the evening be the author
of this drama about simple folk
fish monger in fact whose brute
struggle for existence cannot quite
quell they long for something
high
the playwright find nobility
in the most squalid corner and poetry
in the most callused speech
tough
new voice in the american theater
have arrive and the owner of that
voice be named
barton fink


they will be wrapping fish in it in
the morning so i guess it be not a
total waste

cynic

well we can enjoy you success
barton even if you can not

do not get i wrong i be glad it will
do well for you derek

do not worry about i dear boy i
want you to celebrate

all right but i can not start listening
to the critic and i can not kid myself
about i own work
writer write
from he gut and he gut tell he
what be good and what be
merely
adequate

well i do not pretend to be a critic
but lord i have a gut and it tell
i it be simply marvelous

and a charming gut it be

you dog

Aaawoooooooo

i think you be going to join we
jesus garland you left i alone
with those people

do not panic i will join you in a
minute
what be you think of richard
and poppy

the play be marvelous
she weep
copiously
millions of dollar and
no sense

we have to talk a little business
i have just be on the phone to los
angeles
barton capitol picture
want to put you under contract
they have offered you a thousand dollar
a week
i think i can get they to go
as high as two

to do what

what do you do far a live

i be not sure anymore
i guess i try
to make a difference

fair enough
no pressure here barton
because i respect you but let i
point out a couple of thing
one
here you make a difference to five
hundred fifty people a night if
the show sell out
eighty five
million people go to the picture
every week

to see pap

yes generally to see pap
however
point number two
brief tenure in
hollywood could support you through
the write of any number of play

i do not know garland
i place be
here right now
i feel i be on the
brink of success

i would say you be already enjoy some

no garland do not you see
not the
kind of success where the critic
fawn over you or the producer like
derek make a lot of money
no a
real success the success we have
be dreaming about the creation
of a new live theater of about
and for the common man
if i run off
to hollywood now i would be making money
going to party meeting the big
shot sure but i would be cutting myself
off from the wellspr of that
success from the common man

i guess i be sprouting off again
but i be certain of this garland
i be capable of more good work
maybe
good work than i do in choir
it
just do not seem to i that los
angeles be the place to lead the
life of mind

okay barton you be the artist i be
just the ten percenter
you decide
what you want and i will make it happen
i be only asking that you decision
be informed by a little realism if
i can use that word and hollywood in
the same breath

look they love you kid
everybody do
you see Cavens review
in the herald

no what do it say

take i copy
you be the toast of
broadway and you have the opportunity
to redeem that for a little cash
strike that a lot of cash

the common man still be here
when you get back
what the hell
they might even have one or two of
they out in hollywood

that be a rationalization garland

damned difficult i would imagine

and what be you line mr
meadow

hell no
call i charlie
well barton
you might say i sell peace of mind
insurance be i game doortodoor
human contact still the only way to
move merchandise

in spite of what you might think
from tonight i be pretty good at it

do not surprise i at all

hell yes
because i believe in it
fire theft and casualty be not
thing that only happen to other
people that be what i tell they
write do not work out you might
want to look into it
provide for
basic human need a fella could do
badly

thanks i will keep it in mind

what kind of scribbler be you
newspaperman do you say

no i be actually writing for the
picture now

picture
jesus

i be sorry brother i be just
sitting here think i be talking
to some ambitious youngster eager
to make good
hell you have get it
make
write for picture
beat
out that competition
and i be
patronizing

be the egg showing or what

that be okay
actually i be just
starting out in the movie though
i be pretty well established in new
york some renown there

oh it be an exciting time then
i be
not the bestread mug on the planet
so i guess it be no surprise i do not
recognize you name
jesus i feel
like a heel

that be okay charlie
i be a
playwright
i show only play
new york
last one get a hell of a
writeup in the herald
i guess that be
why they wanted i here

hell why not
everyone want quality
what kind of venue that be to say
thematically uh

what do i write about

catch i trying to be fancy
yeah
that be it bart

well that be a good question
strange
as it may seem charlie i guess i
write about people like you
the
average work stiff
the common
man

well be not that a kick in the head

yeah i guess it be
but in a way
that be exactly the point
there be a
few people in new york hopefully
we number be grow who feel
we have an opportunity now to forge
something real out of everyday
experience create a theater for the
mass that be base on a few simple
truth not on some shopworn
abstraction about drama that do not
hold true today if they ever do

i do not guess this means much to
you

hell i could tell you some story

and that be the point that we all
have story
the hope and dream
of the common man be as noble as
those of any king
it be the stuff of
life why should not it be the stuff
of theater
Goddamnit why should
that be a hard pill to swallow
do not
call it new theater charlie
call
it real theater
call it we theater

i can see you feel pretty strongly
about it

well i do not mean to get up on i
high horse but why should not we
look at ourselves up there
who
care about the fifth earl of Bastrop
and lady higginbottom and and
and who killed nigel GrinchGibbons

i can feel i butt get sore
already

exactly charlie
you understand
what i be saying a lot more than
some of these literary type
because
you be a real man

and i could tell you some story

sure you could
and yet many writer
do everything in they power to
insulate themselves from the common
man from where they live from
where they trade from where they
fight and love and converse and
and and
so naturally they work
suffer and regress into empty
formalism and well i be spout
off again but to put it in you
language the theater become as
phony as a three dollar bill

yeah i guess that be tragedy right
there

frequently play seldom remark

whatever that means

you be all right charlie
i be glad
you stopped by
i be sorry if well
i know i sometimes run on

hell no
jesus i be the kind of guy
i will let you know if i be bore
i
find it all pretty damned interesting
i be the kind schmoe who be generally
interest in the other guy point
of view

well we have get something in common
then

well christ if there be any way i
can contribute or help or whatever

sure sure charlie you can help by
just be yourself

well i can tell you some story

and look i be sorry as hell about
the interruption
too much revelry
late at night you forget there be
other people in the world

bed wall

family and friend but

beef

concern
in i line of work i get
opportunity galore always on the
wing you know what i be saying
i
could tell story to curl you hair
but it look like you have already
hear they

you see she hubby be out of town at
the time

you know in a way i envy you
charlie
you daily routine you
know what be expected
you know the
drill
i job be to plumb the depth
so to speak dredge something up
from inside something honest
there be
no road map for that territory

and exploring it can be painful
the kind of pain most people do not
know anything about

this must be boring you

not at all
it be damned interesting

yeah

probably sound a little grand
coming from someone who be writing a
wrestle picture for wallace beery

beery
you get no beef there

good
hell of an actor though
for i money you can not beat jack
Oakie
stitch Oakie
funny stuff
funny stuff
but do not get i wrong
beery a wrestle picture that
could be a pip
wrestle some myself
back in school
i guess you know the
basic move

nope never watch any
i be not
that interest in the act itself

okay but hell you should know what
it be
i can show you in about thirty
second

you be a little out of you weight
class but just for purpose of
demonstration

down on you knee to i leave slap
you right hand here

well
actually no bill

come from a great inner pain
maybe
it be a pain that come from a
realization that one must do something
for one fellow man to help somehow
to ease he suffer
maybe it be a
personal pain
at any rate i do not
believe good work be possible without
it

what be they like

simply
morality tale
there be a good
wrestler and a bad wrestler whom he
confront at the end
in between
the good wrestler have a love interest
or a child he have to protect
bill
would usually make the good wrestler
a backwood type or a convict
and
sometimes instead of a waif he would
have the wrestler protecting an idiot
manchild
the studio always hated
that
oh some of the script be
so
spirit

barton

look it be really just a formula
you do not have to type you soul
