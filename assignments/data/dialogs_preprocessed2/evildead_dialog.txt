something evil be lurking deep withing the wooded moun
tains of tennessee and the camera take it point of

rising from a swampy bog the mud slide from view
allow it to see early morning mist hanging about the
forest
creeping silently past tree gliding over small
shrub it move onward through the wood until a mammoth
oak rest directly in it path
the tree be uproot by
this unseen force and fall with a deafen crash
near by a stretch of highway curve along the base of
a mountain
the road wind off into oblivion beyond other
peak
from behind view the rumble of an engine can be
hear
it be a large log truck headed south
moving

large oncoming tanker truck with it horn screaming
race toward the car on a collision coarse
scotty watch out
the truck race closer
they steer wheel be locked
