at birth with a rather dull expression
and a really hideous pair of ear
not only take on the beast but pulled
from it clutch assist by a
more famous and brilliant firefighter
i a kick and screaming civilian
that will probably end up suing we
for breaking she fingernail
and to brian who be own contribution
be both more beautiful and less
likely to sue

know when i hear that both
mccaffrey brother be going to be
assign together here well i
heart be filled with
a sudden
desire to transfer
so raise a glass lad
to funny

on each other nerve have managed
with great effort
to still be
pissed off at each other

that be we ignition point
dig it
out
carefully

temperature in this room be about
degree but copper wire in
outlet be melted which require
degree
an accidental short in
the plug could of created a spark of
degree hot enough to melt the
wire and start a fire

no it could not

i mean you would be right with normal
wire
but that be gauge ten in that
plug industrial stuff
who know
why they put it in here but it
will not melt at less than
degree
and no natural spark short
of lightning get that hot
in another life i be in highend
electronics

have outlet analyzed for any trace
of flammable accelerant

do not mention it

hey tim

any other probie i ever have
he
probably hate i guts but i do
the good thing for he
i make he
finally look in the mirror

ah stephen that be what this be really
about be not it
you always have to
be right

hey i be the first one to admit when
i be wrong

yeah
when be the last time

in a fire
never
look i be he brother
i care about
he know
he be going to get
himself killed
maybe not today
maybe not in a year but it would have
happen
and i could not i just
could not

you can not keep be he father

you know what i realized today
i
can not remember i dado face anymore
there be picture of he stare at
i everywhere i go but the guy behind
they
he be go

i will see you around helen

okay alan seagrave and donald
cosgrove

both death due to close encounter
with stationary object
office door
for mr
cosgrove porsche for
mr
seagrave
no nonrelevant trauma
no significant blood toxicology
attitude of both trajectory
consistent with explosion

they run the residue you scraped
from both crispers front door
it be a combination of plumber putty
and rayophene gum
burns almost
completely away when you light it

putty
on both door

there be something else kinda
interesting

see this

guess he do not leave home without
it

anyway down here take a look

mccaffrey hold this for we

uh i do not think that be in i
contract

i just rewrote you contract
mere

jesus christ he be not going to try to
sell you insurance lift he

see that patch of shirt
we wonder
about the discoloration so he run a
spectro
on a lucky shot we picked
up some trace of Trychticholorate
nobody around here have ever hear of
it

Trychticholorate
alright it be an
absorption catalyst in toxic waste
accident
it be pretty rare they
stopped making it a couple year
ago

probably get in Cosgroves clothes
in a gas state from the fire

what the hell be it do in the
fire

that be you job

i ask you to hold he not feel
he up

read

Trychtichlorate be a binary
structured

go to the bottom
under heat
property

during heat episode of kelvin
or high Trych break down and
dissipate
will consume magnesium

ever burn magnesium
it be so hot
it take water molecule and

son of a bitch tear they apart just
to eat the oxygen
would not take
much at all to melt ten gauge wire
problem burn magnesium leaf a
powder trace unless you could
find something that would eat it
residue

Trychticholorate
then Swayzak can
announce seagrave be a murder

look it be not proof okay
someone
may have put the chemical in the
outlet but we find it as a vapor
in Cosgroves clothes

and the putty around the door

even if it be used to seal the air
off that do not explain why someone
would go to the trouble of a
backdraft
gun a helluva lot
easier

but the right guess on this be arson

i do not guess

some people say you do not do much of
anything when it come to this case

i do not work for they either

arson

straight answer you department
given i all week

hey

how be it going

boss and i be up to about three
word an hour

green committed to a thousand
there be another fundraise party
tonight
Martyd really like you to
come

i do not know i be kinda swamp here

i could use a date

yeah
well maybe i can fit it in

mccaffrey
come here

call you back

take the top off
go ahead
take it
off

jesus

that be it
oh that son of a bitch
he be different goddamn it
you see
what this tell we huh
we killer
do not love fire

what

i get it after we talk to ronald
torch
want to fry the whole goddamn
world
but the fire that killed
those guy never really burned up
much
the burn be all light in
outlet surround by double
firebreak in the wall
and he make
he burn backdrafts
p


but he killed these guy

but he could have killed everybody
there
the firebreak keep it from
spreading in the wall
the backdraft
blow out the flame
that be it
that be
the reason

what reason

why backdrafts
whoever fried seagrave
and cosgrove go to a helluva lot
of trouble to make sure they die by
fire but also make sure the fire
blow itself out

that be why the sealant on the door
so what have we get a torch with a
conscience

no we have a stone killer trying to
make a point

be you going public with this

no
do that and i guarantee you will
scare he off
i do not want he
running away

hi

hey
so be you dating you boss or what

if you be not at least the th
person to ask i that i would probably
be pissed
boy you sure know it be a mane world
sometimes

be not he

no he be more of a dinosaur
guy
not a dummy though
he be juggling
alot of ball on this one

yeah but it do not take albert
einstein just to figure out if these
guy be killed by accident or
not

jesus give he a break
there be not
enough proof yet to go public
sure
we find some chemical shit we think
somebody dump in the plug to torch
they and we have maybe figure out why
backdrafts but you can not rush this
stuff
not until it be locked

but Rimgales probably going to come
around to arson

in a dinosaur kinda way yeah

save i

breathe it eat and it hate

the only way to beat it be to think
like it
to know that this flame
will spread this way across the floor
not because of the physics of
flammable liquid or heat convection
but because it want to

some guy on this job fire own
they
it make they fight on it
level
but the only way to truly
kill it be to love it a little just
like ronald

firm that write the report
they do
exactly one job Swayzaks manpower
study
it be not even really a company
no employee no director just a
box
