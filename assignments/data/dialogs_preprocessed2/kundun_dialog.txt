finding the dalai lama
too much
money too much land

we treasury be empty
we army
be deplete
he would have we pull
the hair from we nose

we note this
now the chinese

the ally wish to build a supply
road from india crossing tibet as
part of they war effort
the road
would lead directly to china

we cannot allow it
right now we have a only a small
chinese mission in lhasa the first
since the thirteenth dalai lama
threw they out in
the road would increase the size of
that mission
the chinese would
try to control we trade as they do
once before control we contact
with the outside world

when one understand that
he cause some of he own suffer
needlessly then he look for
the cause in he own life

campaign aim at convincing the
world that tibet belong to china

we do not

the war be over
this be a time in when nation be
redefine themselves

so tibet too need to define

but we attempt have proven
futile
we continue to be
badly outmaneuvered by the chinese

can india help we

india be a newly independent
nation
they be struggling
india be in no position
to help we

britain

britain choose not to

and america

america we shall see

ask the chinese mission to leave
we country
immediately

Reting Rinpoche have die in prison

the communist have control of
china

now as he great army stand idle
on we border chairman mao have
present tibet with three demand
one tibet must accept that
it be part of china

two Tibets defenses must
be handle by china
three all political and trade
matter concerning foreign country
must be conduct through china

give the dalai lama he majority

we can concede that tibet be a part
of china if we can guarantee that
the dalai lamas name and authority
will remain

and do you believe that the tibetan
government will be allow to
continue to function as it be
do you believe that we religion
will be protected

give the dalai lama he majority

we have deal with this chinese
obsession for hundreds of year
we can deal with it now

these be not the chinese we know
these be communist

make he dalai lama now

if we agree that we be part of
china nothing else will matter
not trade not defense
we will be
lost

what would you do holiness

what should i do about i doubt
teacher

it be a difficult situation

i mean i doubt
why i
be i he

doubt be an affliction
Reliquish
it
accept

i believe we must make no concesions
to the chinese
but i be one voice
the dalai lama have always trusted in
the force of buddha
let we consult
the protective deity

we will buy they
we will buy they

we should not accept any condition
from the chinese

enter

summon the lord chamberlain and
the Kashag

enter

holiness

yes

the chinese have invaded

they crossed the river holiness
they have invaded in six location
Chando province Kham eastern tibet

antiaircraft gun and ammunition
from india

in the area

have anyone die

the radio contact said one
officer have die
then he
said the chinese soldier
they be coming

and then the radio go dead

one man
man have die
one man be too many

heavy lie the head that
wear the crown


this week the people
liberation army crossed the Drichu
river east of Chamdo and begin
the peaceful liberation
of tibet
tibet be in the hand of
imperialist enemy of
the people
the dalai

to the member of the united
nation
the attention of the world be
riveted on korea where aggression

force
similar happening in remote
tibet be passing without notice
the problem be not of Tibets
own make but be largely the outcome
of unthwarted chinese ambition
to bring weak nation on she
periphery within she active
domination

this be very good
quite strong

tibetan have for long live a
cloister life in they mountain
fastness remote and aloof

in china

not yet but the governor of Chamdo
Ngabo jigme suggest we must
negotiate and offer to go to peking

he be a capable man

you prime minster would argue
that such negotiation should take
place in lhasa

and then they would concede that the
time be desperate and we must go
to peking
agreed
send Ngabo
be that all

yes

time to study

wait

we be in the last outpost of tibet
let we do away with some of this
formality

just like he be the last time

i will liberate those not

today in peking a seventeen
point agreement for the peaceful
liberation of tibet have be signed
by representative of the government
of the people republic of china
and the local government of tibet


over the last hundred year or more
aggressive imperialist force
have penetrate into tibet and
carry out all manner of deception
and provocation
under such
condition the tibetan nationality
be plunge into the depth
of enslavement and suffer


today this enslavement end
point one
the tibetan people
shall unite and drive out
imperialist aggressive force from
tibet
the tibetan people shall
return to the big family of the
motherland the people republic
of china

point two
the local government
of tibet will actively assist
the people liberation army to
enter tibet and consolidate the
national defense


it mean we have lost we status
as an independent nation

Ngabo do not have the state
seal
he could not sign

yes but they say he do

holiness

yes

general chiang Chinwu the
chinese representative
be en route to Dromo
he be coming to meet you

then we shall meet

dalai lama

general chiang

we bring greeting from chairman
mao

thank you
please sit

have you hear the term of the
seventeen point agreement

i have

i have a copy for you

we come in genuine friendship

i be certain you wish to return to
lhasa

do you have plan to return soon
dalai lama

we first request be that you
allow we to build a road
you have
no road in tibet
we can discuss
the plan in lhasa
when you return

thank you
we leave now

let i see the agreement

counterfeit

i think he would be some kind of
monster even with horn growing out
of he head
but he be only
a man just an ordinary human
be like myself
life be
always a lesson

you prime minister support the
proposal that you return to lhasa
on the opposite hand some official
urge you not to return
they
believe you should leave now
for india

if i be to go into exile could we
expect any serious assistance from
india suppose

it be unlikely
america perhaps
there be great anticommunist feel
in america

at this point the most likely
result of a foreign pact be war

the chinese would see such a
pact as an open declaration of war

tibet at war
no
china be close america be far
away
after countless people
die china would still always
be close
we will work
with what we have

and as for you own safety holiness

i be scare

shall we consult the protective
deity holiness

i first and foremost duty be to
protect i people
i feel sure
of this
and thing change
maybe not right
away maybe not soon
but i believe
this thing will change

impermanence
we own short lifetime be
not the only valid consideration
i shall return

i hope you will not feel badly
about all the thing of childhood
you missed

you lost so much
i be sorry

goodbye Kundun

goodbye Kundun

tribute to the past
i demand
a less formal meet place

i be not a foreigner
i refuse to be treated like one

you see here thangkas of the
fifth dalai lama the founder
of we government
it be tradition
at formal meeting for these
thangkas to be hung

superstition
tibet be part of a
modern nation

i want the song stopped

song
what song

street song about the general
reference to he gold watch
he be right they be quite
insult

i have no authority to ban sing
in i country

you must also do something about
the public meeting
i see this
memorandum circulating with tibetan
grievance

you have cracked a mane skull
and that crack have not heal
it be too soon to expect
he to be you friend

we be simply respect the term of
the seventeen point agreement

be you general

we want more ton of barley
distributed

impossible
you will bring famine
down on the people of tibet with
these insatiable demand
more food the good land for
you soldier to camp

the people liberation army pay
for all food and lodge

so far they do
but the quantity it do not
exist
you will have to re
evaluate you need

how much tea do you drink
prime minister

it depend on the quality
and that it be indian

why be it necessary for the chinese
to keep so many soldier in lhasa

to protect
to serve you
chairman mao want you to feel that
china belong to you now

chairman mao can keep china
just give we back tibet

plan for absorb the tibetan army
into the people army will soon be
finalize

i will not approve it

then we will begin with replace
the tibetan flag with the flag of the
motherland

and we will begin with tearing
it down

i be so sorry

it must be do
we can no longer meet with the
chinese they refuse we

i accept you resignation

have you chosen you new prime
minister holiness

there will be no new prime minister

you will face great difficulty
holiness

they have taken away we silence

the mission of china be to bring
progress to tibet
develop it
natural resource
help it
people develop democracy
we welcome you tibet back to
the motherland

i be so glad that tibet have
come back to the motherland

you must inform i at once if
any of we people abuse the
tibetan trust and good nature

i have great hope for the future of
we cooperation

it be too early to implement all the
clause of the seventeen point
agreement
we will establish a
preparatory committee for the
autonomous region of tibet
the pace
of reform must meet with the
desire of the tibetan people
change must be make slowly as you
yourself judge necessary

i be happy to hear you say this
chairman mao
i have created a
reform committee to investigate
grievance and we have abolish
inherited tax and forgive all
money owe the government by
people who be unable to pay

tibet be a great country

a wonderful history
long ago you
even conquer part of china
but now you have fallen behind and we
want to help you
in twenty year
time you could be ahead of we
then it will be you turn to help
china

you know i have great respect for
you lord buddha

Anticorruption
Antiexploitation
for some politics and religion can
mix

crucial

make in i home

to make

if moral discipline be learned
from the begin one possess
the root for achieve high
rebirth
staircase for achieve
liberation
an antidote eliminate
misery and sorrow
without
discipline there be no method


i be think of becoming a communist
party member

marxism
it be base on equality
and justice for all
i believe
chairman mao wish the good for
we people
we path must be

nonviolence mean cooperation
when it be possible
resistance
when it be not

we have decided that no drastic
change will take place in tibet
for six year
this should make
you happy

army must be used against the
Khamba guerrilla
