spare tyre they be carrying be badly
in need of some air
but they be
normal kid and on a night out well
they be not going to let a storm
spoil the event of they evening
on a night out

it be a night out they be going to

you would well sit here and keep warm
while i go for help

road a few mile
maybe they have
a telephone i might use

i be coming with you

there be no point both of we get wet

i be coming with you
besides darling the owner of the phone
might be a beautiful woman and you may
never come back




in the velvet darkness
of the black night
burning bright

there be a guiding star
no matter what or who you be

there be a light

over at the frankenstein place

there be a light

burning in the fireplace

there be a light a light
in the darkness of everybody life

i can see the flag fly
i can see the rain
just the same
there have get to be
something well here
for you and i

there be a light

burning in the fireplace

there be a light

in the darkness of everybody life




the darkness must go
down the river of night dreaming
flow morphia slow
let the sun and light come streaming
into i life






into i life

betty monroe be to ralph Hapschatt
but franks kiss overwhelmed i with
an ecstacy i have never dream of before

and that be all the time that it take
for a heart to turn to stone
the sweet the wine
the hard to make the break
you hear something about someone
you would think you would known




i could see brad face before i and i
mind scream no
but i lip be hungry
too hungry

after the night there be a brand new day
and there be no pain
and no more sorrow
so wash you face

if only we be amongst friend or sane person




if and only two small word
word
which keep repeating themselves again and
again in janets thought
but it be too
late to go back now
it be as if she be
riding a giant tidal wave
it would be folly
to fight against it
she only chance would
be to ride it out adapt and perhaps also
to survive




yes
there you see it be instinctive
this room be you womb

and from what janet have witness on the
monitor there seem to be little doubt that
she be indeed it slave




tell we about it janet




i be feel do in
could not win
i would only ever kiss before




you mean she only ever kiss

of the main attraction
you need a friendly hand
