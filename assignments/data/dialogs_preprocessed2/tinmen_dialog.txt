need a little leeway

you can not mess around with the
government
why do not you go to

i can just see that schmuck in
that little tax shop telling

it
make a good meal and you
can make sandwich with the
leftover

there be no fuck sympathy for
the work man in this country

they do not make we job easy
tilley

wing it be such a beautiful
thing
you shoulda see how i
work
like a magician

justice in this world
there
be not no justice

do you see the paper

now when you make you initial
sales pitch do you indicate
that you would be giving free
storm window with the job

free storm window

yes
that you would provide a
free set of storm window with
the sale of aluminum side

no sir
i would not be able to
make any money if i be giving
away storm window
i cost of a
storm window be somewhere like




the point be that you have no
intention of giving away the storm
window



the storm window as i can recall
be not an issue
i mention
that i think the storm window
would cut down on they heat
bill and that they would obviously
enhance the look of the house with
the aluminum side work we be
going to do



so you be not dangle a free
set of storm window as a comeon
to selling they the aluminum side
job
because it say here and
i be reading from a statement from
mr
Tabaleri

what do you make of all this

it be the future moe
it be the
future



it be i understand that the
storm window be included in the
price of the sale





where do you think they be get
this information from




i dunno
look like any tin man
get in that hot seat then he be
have it

then they can take you license

find a way to really get even with
this guy
it be not enough to
wreck he car
even breaking
into he house and mess it up
or something that do not have
enough impact
i mean the man
poked i wife
i get to come up
with something ingenious
something ingenious

meatloaf

there be a lot of activity
during this interaction
people coming and going

mr
Babowski claim he do not
break into you house

since the day he ram into i

as they start to pull out of the park lot



tilley sam and bagel be sitting at a table together
looking at menu

menu
i tell you what
i will drop the
charge against you and we can
wipe the slate clean

they get hot in the hand and it be
hard to scoop the stuff out

ought to be content with i food

i be get a little hungry
i have get a headache as it be

in the b
g
stanley have go over to a file cabinet and

cheese wander
over to he

stanley can i help you look for
something

no i be just making myself busy

well i would not do that
bagel
do not like nobody looking at the
file




on phone
he be still holding for nora
we hear a
on the other end of the phone



mrs
tilley

nora this be
the go
reluctantly put the receiver
down



the home improvement commission be in session
tilley
and sam sit at the defense table
masters preside over
the commission table where four or five other commis
sioners sit

into microphone
to tilley sam
do not you approach mr
Boloshevski
august while he be
cutting he front lawn and tell
he that he house have be
selected as one of only home
in the state of maryland for a
free aluminum side job

what be the name again

Boloshevski

do not ring a bell
sam do it ring a bell to you

it do not ring a bell to i either
sir

do not you suggest that for a
nominal labor charge he would
receive over five thousand dollar
worth of aluminum side




that be an awful lot for nothing
do not sound like good business
to i

mr
Boloshevski be ultimately
charged twentyfour hundred
dollar for labor which accord
to we figure be about the average
cost of an aluminum side job

lean into the
microphone
i do not get the point of this

Twentyfour hundred dollar that
you charge for labor be the same
as if mr
Boloshevski have purchased
the aluminum side and have the
labor do

maybe i be missing the point here
but if he paid twentyfour hundred
which be the cost of the job i
can not see anything wrong with that
i do not know the guy but i do not
quite get the problem

what we be get at here
what
we be trying to stress be that
the job be sell under false
term
the man do not win any
award
he be not get
aluminum side at a special price
clear case of deception be
involved here

what be he talking about
the man
get the job for twentyfour hundred
dollar and that be what it cost
in aluminum side




lean into
microphone
um
i do not know
we have no
recollection of this particular
job but i do not know if this be
deception
look if you work in a
clthe store some guy try on
a suit it look like shit but
you tell he it look wonderful
the guy standing there looking
like a sack of shit the salesman
say what a great suit and the man
buy it
that be deception as far
as i can see but i do not
understand the deceptiveness that
you say we be responsible for
if i make myself clear

leaning into
the microphone
i would go along with that as well

what we be trying to establish
be the principle that have be
laid down as part of the home
improvement code of ethics
that you cannot mislead someone
intentionally and i think that be
the principle that apply to this

do somebody put a gun to this
guy head and make he spend
twentyfour hundred dollar
i
do not get the point here
i
do not know the specific of this
case not be privy to all the
information but all i can say be
this guy get a fair price for a
fair job
another commissioner take the microphone

do you know mr
and mrs
rayburn
of aberdeen avenue essex




look to sam
and shrug his
shoulder
then
into mike
i think you would have to familiarize
i

the couple purchased twentyeight
hundred dollar worth of aluminum
side and the two of you be the
salesman on record
they say and
i quote here that they would
have received one hundred and
fifty dollar per home for every
person in the neighborhood who
see they house and decided to
buy aluminum side

looking up from
paper
be that true

it sound right

be you aware that accord to
the home improvement code you
be not allow to exceed a
twenty dollar limit in
incentive

we wanted to be a little more
generous that be all

the couple said that they never
do receive any money from any
other job as you have promise

leaning into
microphone
we do not get any lead from they
they house be not the showplace
that we think it would be
it
do not generate the activity that
we have hope




but should a referral turn up in
the community we would be more than
happy to give they twenty dollar
instead of the hundred and fifty

leaning into
microphone
excuse we for one moment
he then lean over to delaney and they start to confer
tilley and sam watch wonder what be going on
master
lean in the other direction holding he hand over the
microphone and he talk to the other commissioner
they nod in approval then masters lean back into the
microphone

thank you very much gentleman
should there be a reason in the
future to call you back we would
like to reserve that right

lean into
microphone
glad we could be of some service
tilley and sam get up from the table and walk out of
the build



tilley and sam be walking toward Tilleys car

rub he hand
gleefully
we beat they sam
we beat they
what a piece of cake
no problem
they be not get nothing on we
clean as a whistle
we be clean
as a whistle

i need a drink
i hate
inquisition




heavy be falling
nora with an umbrella walk
quickly across the park lot
suddenly slip
under the umbrella with she

i do not want to see you anymore
she pull away from and continue walking

nora still walking toward she car in the downpour

i do not owe you anything

after a beat he yell out

it be a lousy thing to do okay
it be a lousy thing to use you
to get back at you husband
but
the fact be that i never would
have meet you otherwise
nora stop and turn to look at

it be lousy
it be a
disgusting terrible thing
but a lot of good come out of it

what kind of a person would come
up with such a devious thing

i be not always a nice guy i
admit that
i get a lot of
train in deceit
it be an
occupational hazard
they stand looking at one another in the rain




i would like to know what it be about
i that i have to fall for tin
man

little overzealous in the heat of
the sales pitch that be all
be watch the proceeding

be it the heat of the sales pitch
on february rd of this year that
make you write across a contract
this job be free

who be falling apart

as i remember no sale be make
concerning those customer

it fell out because a loan could not
be arranged but the people do
agree in principle
the point that we would like to stress
be that you mislead these people
tell they the job be free
then
you send in you close with some
cover story about how you have
suffer a nervous breakdown and
a sale be ultimately make for
twentythree hundred and seventy
seven dollar
that be mislead
and deceptive sales practice

it be temporary insanity

deceptive sales practice on you

section violation

who be watch the proceeding intently



it be the feel of this commission
that these infraction be severe
violation of the home improvement
law and therefore constitute
misuse of the license to sell
aluminum side as approved by this
state


it be the decision of this
commission to revoke you license
to sell aluminum side

he be not very happy



which will prohibit you from
practice in the state of
maryland
