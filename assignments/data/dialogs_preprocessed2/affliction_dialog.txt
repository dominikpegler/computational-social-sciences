there be something funny about that
shoot
there be lots funny about
it actually

i hear he be drunk at Tobys last
night and get in a fight with hettie
he drive off without she

i be sure i be positive it do not
happen the way jack say it do

jack turned into one of those
man who be permanently angry
he
used to be a sweet kid but it be
like when he find out he could not
play ball anymore he changed
now
he be like everyone else

i have be wonder if maybe jack
shoot Twombley instead of Twombley
shooting himself
i have be wonder
maybe jack shoot he on purpose

wade
how can you even think such a
thing
why would jack hewitt do that
shoot Twombley on purpose



money

jack do not need money

everybody need money
except guy
like Twombley and that sonofabitch
soninlaw of he
people like that

jack would not kill for it
besides
who would pay he

lots of people
guy like evan
Twombley boston union official
probably get lots of people want to
see he dead
the government be
investigating he link with the
mafia

the mafia hire jack hewitt

no i just know jack lying about
what happen
he just seem i
know that kid what he be like inside
he be a lot like i be at he age

you would not have do anything like
that shoot someone for money

no
not for money
but if somebody
given i half a damn excuse i
be pretty fucked up you know

but not now

when you going to get that tooth fixed

i can see what you look like as a
kid

you know i as a kid

not really
never really studied
you face like now
i be never
able to see you as a kid when you
be a kid until now this way

what way

after making love
i like it
it be
nice to see that in a grownup person

you ever come to you father grave
anymore

no not anymore
it be too
it be
too far

we should talk

we have do all we talk wade

it be just

let the past be
i be sorry about you mother
i liked
she
you never know how much woman
like that suffer
it be like they
live they live with the sound turned

and stay out here with pop
we can not
leave he alone here he will set the
damn place on fire
with jill here a
lot it will be good to have margie
around
thing be going to change
in that department by the way
i
get a custody lawyer in concord
i be
going to see he tomorrow
all hello
going to break loose but it be worth
it

i want to let the gas run out
i
do not want the bastard driving drink
and he be always drunk now
after
we will hide the key

anything new about the shoot
Twombley

i guess it be an accident like
everybody think

want to know what i think happen

find they everywhere

i think you first response to the
Twombley shoot be the correct
one

which be

that it be not an accident

then who shoot he

well you friend i think
jack
hewitt

motive
you get to have a motive

money

Whod pay he that kind of money
not the mob
they get they own guy
specialist

they would not deal with a guy like
jack
who else benefit if Twombley
be suddenly dead

i do not know
you tell i

okay
it be likely there be people
in the union who do not want Twombley
to testify
they probably include
he soninlaw who be vicepresident
and will probably be the next
president
i read that in the paper
what be he name mel gordon

yeah the guy with the i told
you about
i do do not i

here i theory
Twombley unaware
of illegal union loan or whatever
start nose around because of the
investigation and find out
find
out he soninlaw be involved

so mel gordon would not want a
professional hit
that would make the
feds dig deep
he want an accident

hunt accident be perfect

shit around here you shoot somebody
in the wood you say it be an
accident you get fined fifty buck
and you hunt license lift
jack probably saying the guy shot
himself because he be not get he deer
yet and do not want he license pulled

it be too neat
thing be not that
neat
it make i mad
that somebody
can pay to kill somebody he own
fatherinlaw and not be punished
for it
do not that piss you off

not particularly

right right goddamnit
do not you
care what be right

i care about what happen
the truth
i be a student of history remember

i be think about that story you
told i about pop and chopping the
firewood out of the ice and after

yeah

i hate to disappoint you but i do not
think it happen

of course it happen
why would i
lie about it

it may have happen but not the
way you said

you think i would not remember a thing
like that

it be not i
i be not there but i
hear about it
when i hear about
it it be about Elbourne

we would have to go digging in vietnam
to ask he

and Elbourne and mom take you to the
doctor and told he you fell from
the hay loft

well i never hear that one

i remember clearly because when i hear
i become real careful around pop
i
be a careful child and i become a
careful adult but at least i be not
afflicted by that mane violence

that be what you think

i get to head back
it be a long drive


put out that fuck cigarette

not there asshole
flush it

morning gordon

i be fucking out of here

lawford

out of this fuck job
this job
suck
work outside in the winter
suck

open the door will you

yes indeedy



i screw up the divorce
i agreed
with everything she said
i wanted
she to like i
i just want to be a
good father

it would help if you be marry
if there be someone at home while
you work

i plan to
soon

how soon

this spring

good
it would help if there be
some drug or alcohol abuse on the
part of you exwife
sexual problem
upsetting to the child

it look pretty hopeless do not it

no not exactly
i will look at the
divorce decree see if we can get it
redraw
interview you daughter
jill right

yes

fine
i will need a retainer
you
can mail it

jesus
how much
how much will the
whole thing cost

hard to say
if we go for custody
deposition psychiatric evaluation
it could drag on
ten or twelve
thousand dollar
she could win on
appeal
if we just want to get the
visitation right redraw assuming
they be unduly restrictive it
would not be more than twentyfive
hundred

oh

you might be well off legally as
well as financially to just go for
the

i know
the custody suit thing
be just i get back at she

the historical fact be known by
everyone all of lawford all of
new hampshire some of massachusetts
fact do not make history
we
story wade and mine describe
the live of boy and man for
thousands of year boy who be
beaten by they father whose
capacity for love and trust be
cripple almost at birth and whose
best hope if any for connection
with other human being lay in an
elegiac detachment as if life be
over




it be how we keep from destroy in
turn we own child and terrorize
the woman who have the misfortune to
love we
how we absent ourselves
from the tradition of male violence
how we decline the seduction of
revenge



jack truck turned up three day
later in a shop mall in toronto
even without the footprint the
bullet wade utter disappearance
seem evidence enough of he guilt




LaRiviere and mel gordon be indeed
in business
the parker mountain ski
resort be now advertised all across
the country
jimmy dame tend bar at
the lodge
chub merritt opened a
snowmobile dealership nick wickham
run the new burger king
margie
fogg moved to littleton near she
mother
lillian and jill go with
bob horner to a new job in seattle



we want to believe wade die die
that same november freeze to death
on a bench or a sidewalk
you cannot
understand how a man a normal man
a man like you and i could do such
a terrible thing
unless the police
happen to arrest a vagrant who turn
out to be wade whitehouse or maybe
he will not be a vagrant
maybe he will
have turn himself into one of those
faceless fellow working at the video
store and live in a townhouse
apartment at the edge of town until
he mailman recognize he from the
picture at the post office unless
that happen there will be no more
mention of he and he friend jack
hewitt and we father
the story
will be over
except that i continue
