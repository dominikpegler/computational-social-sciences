this hospital be a nightmare
the
elevator be never there when you

where be the girl

haley take sara up to the maternity
ward

how be you feeling

i head hurt

you be lucky you do not get killed


i told you i be sorry

you try be awaken at four
of the clock in the morning by the
police saying they have you son
he be unconscious and on he way to
the hospital
i have never be so
scare in i life
and poor rudy

what

i good friend be dead

eat this
it will make you feel
well

i be not hungry
besides i can not
taste anything anyway

hospital food be always bland
this have flavor

no it be because of i condition
i can not taste or smell anything
anymore

what be you saying condition
what condition

i condition


leonard have a condition
it be
call anosmia

oh i god
be it serious

no
anosmia be when a person
loose they sense of smell
it be
not uncommon in patient who suffer
serious head injury
unfortunately it be also affecting
he ability to taste
again not
uncommon

be it permanent

depend on the patient

what do we do
he can not eat

he can eat
he just can not taste
what he be eating

what she mean be he will not eat

leonards association with food be
no longer about taste
it be about
texture
while we may be partial
to sweet or salty food leonard
will become partial to crunchy or
smooth one
once he settle on a
texture he like he appetite will
increase

i can not believe this be happening

consider what leonard could have
suffer he be lucky
besides he
be severely overweight
loss of
appetite may be a benefit


how do we do

you have to eat something
it may
not be gourmet but you do not look
that finicky

this stuff feel like shit in i
mouth

it be macaroni and cheese

it feel gross
like there be a
film on i tongue

i do not like apple

so you can not taste it right
maybe you will like the crunch

anytime i mention it i mother
go crazy

if you really want she to drop a
few ton put she in jail
Kennys
lost about pound since he be
be incarcerate and he be
already thin

yeah
jail be the perfect weight
loss program
you take a fat tub
throw they in a room and force they

do not
let they out till they do

Malee dinner

Malee
oh i god

what do you do

i get a new look
you know for
spring
what do you think

you look

beautiful

different
what happen to you
glass


contact
it take i like forty
five minute to get they in but
beauty be pain

honey in the future i would like to
know if you be going to radically
change you appearance
clean you
stuff up and come down for dinner

Malee
i god you look

different

beautiful
you look beautiful

i feel like i needed a change you
know

i bet you be driving the boy at
school wild

boy i age be so immature
i be
more attracted to old gentleman


you do not want somebody that much
old than you
an age difference
can because problem

what kind of problem

lot of time when a couple have an
age difference they wind up
split up because they want
different thing

you mean sex

no

i mean yeah
you may be but a
boy even three year old than you
be probably more experienced
boy can be impatient about that
sort of thing

be you impatient

no but when i be a kid

why do not you have a girlfriend

i do but it do not work out

how old be she

about i age

see that age be not an issue yet
you still wanted different thing
