from the old video game just a yellow
ball with a mouth fill the screen in all it be lore glory
the camera track along as it roll along a tight corridor
gobbling dot

follow in hot pursuit


give it the slip cut down and gobble a
big dot

but just before he catch up the transform
back to and change direction again
barely
escape

flee but at every turn he be confront by another
ghost
the pull out in a series of jump cut to
reveal that unlike the old arcade game this game screen go
forever an infinite maze
and instead of the original
on four there be thousands of ghost at all side closing in
the sound of the game redouble reverberate deafen





this scene play out as a continuous shoot right up
until CHEVs face be revealed for the first time

the live room toward the telephone where he spot a
plain black tape prop up in front of a plasma screen
with police ribbon wrapped around it tied in a bow like
a present

Whathufuck

be visible in the
frame unconscious behind
pale nicotine sunlight
filter in through the blind

the discernible sound of heartbeat will subliminally
increase in speed and volume throughout monologue
