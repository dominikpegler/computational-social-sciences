i think by now she would be cure
cancer directing movie running
for the senate



what have happen
she life make no
sense
i mean i could see a
direct plausible link between this
eddie broke and buz at three
of the clock in the afternoon and an
early eddie



vomit on he bossa desk
during a presentation





or stealing he die aunt
Percocet

melissa and this upstate melissa
dump coldcalling people from
she live room



long block later i be home

away from she
i have thoughtlessly
ingest a substance

like the rentes not low enough



i have get remarkably little
information from vernon about what
this drug would do

you could be a bike messenger and
come up with that





what if it be a hallucinogen
oh i god

be talking about calling these
people he know from the club to
muscle you out i have tell he not
to do that but he be really pissed



and then
i feel it



level more layer more
more
galactically more
but the
same
just the depth and beauty
of clarity

what be wrong

blame you you see a schlumpy
energy sucking defeat sack of

have and you would have go the extra
mile a nice little apple for the
professor





information from the odd museum
show a halfread article some
documentary be all bubbling up to
i frontal lobe mixing itself
together into a sparkling cocktail
of useful information

in minute it be a
polish gem

and tidy
what be this a drug
for people who want to get anal



i be not high be not wired just
clear
what i needed to do
and how
to do it



the next morning i send a little
probe down into i brain
no surge
of brilliance come up to greet i
i feel thick and stupid a
shuffling zombie without i coffee
and cigarette
in short





i be back



but something remain

hour and you do not want to keep
reading i will give back the advance


eddie

i would really like to shit just
call i the minute you get in
call
okay
okay





but how would i finish
it be
enhance eddie who displayed all
that brilliance
not i



yeah

vern
it be eddie

bad time okay

vern last night page just
write themselves
i totally chuck
the novel i pitched they i
suddenly vern how this whole
societal economic class struggle
and it solution do not have to
be futuristic or fictional it
be actually here in
we lifetime and i could just
lay it out like like a manifesto
or something like Mein Kampf
except not by a crazy racist fuck
okay i will not talk any more about
this if you let i in

well that be fast



do not ask

so eddie
i guess you be
interest after all



yeah
that stuff amazing

it work good if you be already
smart



you do not want to know

what be
um
what be it called

it do not have a street name yet
because it do not have a street
profile
and that be the way we want
it to stay
the boy in the kitchen
be calling it

the boy in the kitchen
vern
that do not sound approved

FDAapproved that be a laugh
do
you really believe that shit



okay so what do we have here
some unknown untested possibly
dangerous drug scammed out of some
unidentified lab somewhere given
to i by a highly unreliable guy i
have not see in year

so you want some more of it

yes
definitely




we will talk about it
but first
maybe you can do i a little favor

uh
sure

you can see i be in no shape to go
out right now
will you hop down to
the dry cleaner and get i suit
and maybe pick i up a little
breakfast



it be amazing how quickly it all
slot back into place



the dealerclient dynamic



the easy sacrificing of dignity
for the guarantee return of a dime
bag or a gram or in this case a
little pill that be going to cost
i a month rent



yes
i
i need to report a
murder
eddie
morgan
edward
i will not



it take they forever
and the
longer i sit there the clear i
see
vern have known whoever have
do this
he would opened the door



and one guess what they would be
looking for


at least you get you last meal

you never do like to cook



let i see you hand

Heyheyhey
i be the one that called
you

no exwifes brother
i just
run into he on the street and he
invited i up to you know

buy some drug

wha no
talk
what be you

okay fine what do this guy do

he be i do not know i hear he
be sort of an antique dealer

dealer

yeah
of uh
viennese kind
of
chair
sort of curlicue
leg kind of thing

yeah
that be correct
an edward
morgan
he be here



the victim sister

melissa

eddie
you be there



i have not hear she voice in
year

right before
i would just run into he
on the street

god
this be all so weird

melissa you do not think i have
anything to do with

no no no eddie i know that
i
wish i be more surprise
he
be
involved in some stuff
i
well not say any more

not on this line no

melissa
maybe



do you want to
meet somewhere
or

eddie i have get to do the funeral
and god know what else
i just
we can not meet okay

then
i will see you at the
funeral

no
i do not want that please
do not
i will call you at some
point when this be over
okay

okay

okay

something do not jell here



but i know when he attention
wander to something more
pressing that he be going to let
i go





only then do it occur to i that
someone could have follow i from
Verns apartment



probably not
hopefully not
worth the risk




back on it be obvious what i
should do





Verns cash



combined with an unprecedented
surge of motivation

enable i to finish the book in
four day



tablet a day
keep the torpor
away
and what i could do with i
day
be limitless



i now have cultural appetite



learn to read music in a week


even halflistening to any
language i become fluent



the only cloud be the nagging
feeling i be be follow



be i
or do create paranoia



the focal point of i existence
quickly become
protecting i
stash



call it a homage



i have a new improve game





so you be saying that any author
who be commandeer adjective
status orwellian dickensian

be prosaic
yes

which mean a prosaic author work
rest on a foundation of acclaim



so you be saying praise and fame
be unrelated to achievement that
the great hit cannot
possibly contain good song
that
shakespeares catchiness belie
mediocrity

i

well then i would guess you would rather
not hear about what i personally
think could launch a thousand
ship



fish in a barrel



and it be not just woman
i be
for the first time in i life a
presence




of course all this seem to work
well with people i do not know
than with people who know i

so mom you be totally
misinvested these guy be have
do the most Pliocine era
fundamental analysis and paid no
attention to eye candy psychology
surrounding the stock
okay remember when i explain
default flop
do any of that
stick
CDSs
cdos cbos



i quickly return to the
unfamiliar audience

sure you get a short term spike
but would not that rapid expansion
devalue the stock completely in two
year

no no there be safeguard



against aggressive overexpansion
there be not because there be no
safeguard in human nature

we be wired to overreach you
look at history i mean all the
country that rule the world
portugal
with it big butch navy
all that be left be salt cod and
cheap condo the brit
now they
just sit on they dank little
island fuss over they suit
nobody stop and think hey we be
do pretty well we have get poland
and france and a big swiss bank
account let we not invade russia
in the winter
let we go home and
pop a beer and live off the
interest

yeah
it will all happen again

hey i want in on it



i brain be just pouring this
stuff out
everything i would ever
read hear see be now
organized and available here it
be here you go

you must have a portfolio but if
you do not i would be very interest
in working with you



thank you so much



i must have a portfolio
very
well if i must i must



but Verns cash be low
and it
take cash to make cash



but it take cash to make cash

i would like to renegotiate i
advance

well
sit down we will be
discuss that

first ah
i want to apologize
eddie if i in any way communicate
a lack of faith in you ability

mr
dunham have read you page and
we be prepare to make you what i
hope will be a very exciting offer

what would you say to ten thousand
more and another forty down the
road



we think this could be an important
title maybe one in a series
i
have to say you come out of
nowhere but the good one always


this be not going to work

what be not going to work
the
money

eddie we take you very seriously
as a writer

yes but i now see that writing as
a profession be for marginalize
whiner not fit for anything else

no i mean it look at the life
incarceration loneliness
burrow down into you own
psyche increasingly insulated from
any truth because you be not in
the current of the world any more
you be rattling around inside the
cage of you brain self
cannibalize

you do not think a bestselling
author would disagree




oh if you be good there be some
remuneration eventually after
paperback but at good you
career be ooze along like a
snail a few thousand more copy
whoopdeedoo you be developing a
readership for what
so you
can end up in phoenix on a saturday
night read from you own work at
some holdout indie book store to a
bore audience of ten
half of
they there for the wine and cheese

yes but if you goal be to have a


i do not think any goal will be
really achievable mark until i be
sitting on a large pile of cash



i would have to start very very
small
in a down market
no one
be making money
but no one have


you have get you quantitive analysis
quants
Algorhythms to find
minute price discrepancy
you be looking at number only
price and volume pattern


armed with Verns last dollar
i make in a day
it be too slow




next day


still too slow
i needed more
capital

why not

because i do not see you before
and
i do not fucking like you already
why do i give you thousand
dollar

because i quintuple i money four
day in a row

you be lucky

it be not luck

okay you trick they computer
you get some fix on the game



you think

so you be a crook

and that be a problem for you
because

you people all get catch

i will not
and what if i do
you
think i keep detail record of i
investor
you will have you money
back long before they figure out
what happen

okay you take this
you mine
you do not pay you know what we do
we cut you around the waist peel
you skin pull it up over you
head and tie knot in it
and you
do not die from that
you suffocate





i new friend kevin doyle show
i how you could leverage two and a
half time you cash at a day
trade firm



i would be up the dose for over a
week
it seem to cut i learn
curve



it be instinct
but inform
instinct instinct base on huge
amount of research which thank
to be conduct more rapidly
and comprehensively than anyone at
lafayette day trading would ever
know

why be you buying that
the
just get indicted

but not for the big fat defense
contract he bribe he way into
that be still on
should be
announced in a week



at the end of the week i brokerage
account contained
over a million
dollar






i would hear the old metaphor about
the stock market
it be a
collective nervous system a global
brain a numerical representation
of the will of god



whatever it be i be jack in
boot up i mind be living
tissue inside the great
function whole

look there be no time for human
judgement anymore

chance you blink and it be go
we entered the age of
decentralized online decision
making with the decision being
make by hundreds of millions of
individual investor around the
world people who do not even know
each other making a kill in
less time than it take to sneeze

until they be not

same rule even in a panic
it be
not understanding how company
work

psychology works

well from thousand to two point
eight million in ten day

pierce

artist or a very smart young man

i be quickly back up to speed

be it possible to construct an
imperceptible compartment

carl van loon and hank atwood
remain unaware that soon i would

same industrial concession in
mexico that both we company be
secretly sniff out
