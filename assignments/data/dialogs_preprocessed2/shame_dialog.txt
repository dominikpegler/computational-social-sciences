distant apartment
the of crossing overhead
listen then get up pull blind and head out
towards the bathroom
the of he foot disappearing down a distant corridor
the of an answer phone as we hear pee in a
far off bathroom

the door
just visible through the window of the train walk
towards a distant seat

crowd train
sit **further/far along the car
haggard and grey and sleeping the seat empty either side
of he
he look more like a pile of clothes

toilet the shutting of the door and the shower be
switched on

car
consider catching the eye of
seated opposite the whisper of a smile
grazing she lip

at
glass door open
the bring in coffee sliding down a cup in
front of

progression a descent into hell
moving with stealth amongst those

gentle rise and fall of she breath
BRANDONs gaze falling on lying in the hospital bed
she wrist bandage
eye falling on the scar covering she arm
he
reach out a hand on the edge of touching they letting his
finger hover over they until finally
lightly outline a snake scar seeping up she arm
she stir a little but
SISSYs eye just opening focus on he until

shithead
relief overwhelming he laugh exhale on the edge
turn to stroke SISSYs hair rest he head next to
hers
she sleep again





now walking along the side of the river railing
seemingly speeding up he journey
beyond the shadowy black figure of a break jetty stretch
out toward the open river





the endless grey of the hudson river close now
walking along a concrete jetty
rusting build oxidize and stain salt green edge
along the jetty until
reach the edge of the jetty looking out
the of grey water beneath

stand a hangover kicking in
and at once be crying the tear flowing slow at
first until they rush like floodgate opening
he reach
for breath trying to stifle the howl emanate from his
body inconsolable now flooded with emotion
sink squat to the ground buckle in two body
shudder
the of the water steady now
sob and sob and sob a mess of snot and tear as
he look out over the wide sweep of the hudson river
far off the drone of the freeway the early evening trawl of
traffic kicking in
the froth of the tide back and forth rising and breaking
back and forth





stand in he familiar spot on the platform waiting
for the train that will take he to work
wear a vacant
face the train pull into the station
board
he take a seat automatically as if preprogram
the
train leaf the platform





look into no mane land feel the heat of
someone gaze
as he instinctively look up to respond a
mixture of surprise fear excitement and doubt across his
face
the who we meet at the begin of we
story be stare down at this time in a more
engage fashion
she look because she want to be look
at
again a dance begin
this time she lead
engaged active
decisive
BRANDONs face be fracture into many conflict emotion
it be as if a magnet be draw he in but at the same time
he be trying to resist
at this moment the stand up eye
as she make she way to the door block as
the train pull in to she stop






the train pull away from the station and disappear into the
tunnel
we do not know if be still aboard or have
succumb to he urge
