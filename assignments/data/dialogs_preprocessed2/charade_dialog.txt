maybe

or tex

maybe

you be a big help
can i have one of
those

Vanillechocolat

i think tex do it

why

because i really suspect gideon
and it be always the person you do not
suspect

do woman think it be feminine to be
so illogical or can not they help
it

what be so illogical about that

it be always the person you do not
suspect
that mean you think
it be tex because you really suspect
gideon
therefore if you think
it be tex it have to be someone else
gideon

oh
i guess they just can not help it

who

woman
you know i can not help feeling
rather sorry for scobie

to be interest in anything sensible

i suppose all this be lead
somewhere

it lead i away from umbrella frame
for one thing
but that left i
without any honest means of support

what do you mean

when a man have no profession except
the one he loathe what be left
i
begin looking for people with more
money than they would ever need
including some they would barely miss

have chosen but i suppose it capture
the spirit of the thing

di conseguenza il Governo italiano
e decisamente a favore per
lincoraggiamento in accordo con le
tradizioni etniche rispettive delle
culture basilari dei passi in via di
sviluppo
per esempio pregare i
Vietnamiti di aggiungere alle loro
risaie ed ai loro campi di soja
tradizionali una raccolta di semola
non solo sconvolgerebbe le loro
secolari tradizioni ma oltre tutto
e questo e molto importante per il
Governo che io ho lonore di
rappresentare disturberebbe
lesportazione delle derrate farinose
italiane in questa parte del mondo
signori Delegati vi ringrazio della
vostra attenzione

i hope JeanLouis understand about

oh la vache

mr
chairman fellow delegate i
distinguish colleague from italy
she Majestys delegation have listen
with great patience to the southern
european position on this problem
and while we find it charmingly
stated we cannot possibly agree
with it content
in in the
british colony of kenya uganda
and tanganyika and if i be not
mistaken more or less in somaliland
a programme of crop rotation be
institute visavis arable land
which have never before known the
plough beginning before the soil
be able to know the sort of fatigue
now plague most of western europe
in therefore she Majestys
government at that time he
Majestys government be able to
properly assay the situation
