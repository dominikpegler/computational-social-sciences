word or two

lotta yous be wonderin what make i

Seein as i
be not the good seed in the bunch i can
understand that

buncha year ago i be runnin from some
bad fella in the wood over there by
cleary
those old boy be comin after i
hard and i reach in i bag lookin for
i old shotgun but it be go
i momma
have take it out when i be not lookin and
put this bible in there instead

well i figure i be do for so i sit
down under an old tree with this useless
book and i wait

and then the strange thing
happen
they boy run right on past i
do not even see i sittin there
now the
way i figure it thing would have turn
out pretty different if i have pull out
that shotgun instead of this here bible
and that be probably the first time i can
remember god savin i butt
god
and i momma

figure least i could do be build em both
this church

to kampala

if i wanted to be close to kampala i would
be close to kampala
