when the parade of shiny black car roll by
he look
up and scratch he head at the unusual sight

how
do i know you will not go testify
not testify but you know
talking about it to somebody else

i will not discuss a patient with
anyone for any reason unless i
know the patient may be a danger
to himself
like if i be concern
a patient might kill himself

not fuckin likely

or kill someone else




so who start

why do not you tell i why you think
you need therapy

i do not need therapy
i be helping
out i friend
