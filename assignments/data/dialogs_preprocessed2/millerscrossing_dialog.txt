and

man
i be talkin about friendship
i be talkin about
character
i be talkin abouthell leo i be not
embarassed to use the wordI be talkin about
ethics


you know i be a sport man
i like to
make the occasional bet
but i be not
that
sport
caspar
when i fix a fight sayif i pay a threetoone
favorite to throw a goddamn fightI figure i get
a right to expect that fight to go off at three
toone
but every time i lay a bet with this
sonofabitch bernie bernheim before i know it the
odds be even upor badly i be betting the short
money




the sheeny know i like sure thing
he be
selling the information i fixed the fight
out
oftown money come pourin in
the odds go
straight to hell
i do not know who he be sellin
it to maybe the los angeles combine i do not
know
the point be bernie be not satisfy with
the honest dollar he can make off the vig
he
be not satisfy with the business i do on his
book
he be sellin tip on how i bet and that
means part of the payoff that should be ridin on
i hip be ridin on someone else
so back we
go to these questionsfriendship character
ethics
caspar


so it clear what i be sayin
leo
clear as mud
caspar
it be a wrong situation
it be gettin so a
businessman can not expect no return from a fix
fight
now if you can not trust a fix what
can
you trust
for a good return you get to go
bettine on chance and then you be back with
anarchy
right back inna jungle
on account of
the breakdown of ethics
that be why ethics be
important
it be the grease make we get along
what separate we from the animal beast a
burden beast a prey
ethics
whereas bernie
bernheim be a horse of a different color ethics
wise
as in he be not get any
he be stealin
from i plain and simple
leo
you sure it be bernie selling you out
Bluepoint
it be not elf
leo
nobody else know about the fix
caspar
no one that be not get ethics
leo
what about the fighter you pay to tank out
Bluepoint
we only pick fighter we can put the fear of god
in
leo
any other booky know
you play anyone else
book
caspar
i lay an occasional bet with mink Larouie
Bluepoint
but it be not mink i will vouch for that
leo
how do you know
caspar
it be not mink
mink be Bluepoints boy
leo
mm
and of course Bluepoint always know about
the fix
Bluepoint
what the hell be that suppose to mean
leo
let it drift
all it mean be a lot of people
know
caspar
i guess you be not be listening
sure other
people know
that be why we get to go to this
question of character determine just who exactly
be chiseling in an i fix
and that be how we
know it be bernie bernheim
the Motzah kid
because ethically he be kinda shaky
leo
you know Bernies chiseling you because he be a
chiseler
and you know he be a chiseler because
he be chiseling you
caspar
sometimes you just know
leo


so you want to kill he
Bluepoint
for starter
leo

tion

matter of
time
i said the kid too smart for leo
that be what i said
like a psychic

and an office that look like a french whore
house
terry
one more thing


tom
leo say that too



terry
no i said that
cross leo and next time i will
say plenty
caspar
when you be right you be right but you never say
i told you so


tom
so what i right about
caspar
well i will tell you but first you get to promise
not to say i told you so
tom
i never say that
and i do not like people who
do
caspar
mink be robbin i right along with the Mptzah
tom


what convinced you of that
caspar
mink Larouie take a powder
we can not find he
Bluepoints makin excuse for he but personal
ly i think you be right
i think mink and
bernie be in it together
i think mink hear
you would bump the Motzah and light out
the lousy
sonofabitch
tom


i told you so
caspar
okay
you get a lip on you
Ats all right
i
do not generally care for it but that be all
right


you be a good sport to bump the
Motzah
i just like to make sure i friend be
i friend
so


friends right
tom
how you know mink skip
caspar
Bluepoint can not find he
tom
so he say
caspar
Meanin what exactly
tom
maybe nothing


i do not give it much think
until now since a guy will say pretty much
anything when he know he number be up but just
before i bump bernie he swear to i that
Bluepoint and mink be setting he up
that
they be the one that be selling out you
fix
caspar
zat so




like you say a guy say anything
tom


Uhhuh
so why be not Bluepoint here
caspar
well




he do not care for you kid
maybe it be
only fair to tell you


after you left we he
tried to sell i on a doublecross
he say to
i why do not we doublecross you and give you
the bump once we get the Motzah
but i figure a
deal a deal you be square with i you bump the
Motzah i will hold up i end
question of ethics
everything above board that be how i like it so
everybody know who be a friend and who be an
enemy


but Bluepoint would not cross
i
we
go back
tom
Uhhuh


course there be always that wild card
when love be involved


caspar


i know mink be Bluepoints boy but i still
do not make it that way
tom

so he hear some rumor bernie be not
dead those story pop up people see dillinger

and he do not like you much anyway so he decide
to check it out
tom
any story about bernie be alive Bluepoints
make up himself
caspar
aw you do not know that
it do not even make
sensewhy would he
tom

tom
Bluepoint know about it
caspar
yeah




okay i get it
tom
if Bluepoints be selling you out on these
fight and mean to again he will have to be able
to point the finger at someone else
caspar
yeah yeah i get it
tom
but with bernie dead there be not a hell of a
lot of people he can point to
caspar
yeah
Bluepoint sell i out
make pretend
Bernies still do it
Ats real pretty
bernie leak the fix and you take the fall for
supposedly not killing he





but i dunno why would Bluepoint cross i
like that
money okay everybody like money
but somehow it do not seem like he
and i know
the Bluepoint
tom
nobody know anybody
not that well
caspar
money do not mean that much to he
tom
then it be not just money he be after
he be get a
wart on he fanny
caspar


huh
tom
wart
on he fanny
give he the fidget
maybe he be sick of sitting on the couch and maybe
behind you desk do not look like a bad place to
move to
maybe he figure the money can help
move he there
caspar


kid you get a lip on you


i do not generally care for it
but you be
honest and that be something we can not get enough
of in this business


i will admit since last
we jaw i stomaches be seazin up on i
Bluepoint saying we should doublecross you
you
doublecross once where be it all end
an
innaresting ethical question
i will find blue
point talk to he straighten it out
tom
sure talk to he
have a chat
ask he whether
he be selling you out
do not take care of he
before he make he next move just sit back and
let he make it
you be swimmin in it


johnny i chine hanging out right along
side yours
caspar

tom


i would worry a lot less if i think you be
worrying enough
caspar


but i be kid


christ


run
thing




tom

tom
i be in stitch
it be mink be not it
bernie
i come back and he be not happy to see i
can
you beat that tom
all he could taik about be
how he have to skip and how much trouble he would be
in if anyone find i at he place
tom
some friend
bernie

i
figure hell you be a friend
maybe you could
