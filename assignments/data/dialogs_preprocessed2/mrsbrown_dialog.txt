











god save the queen





i have send for a mr
john from
balmoral
she majesty have mention
he on one or two occasion as be
a most devote outdoor servant to
prince albert during he last day
there




the depth of the queens sorrow
remain impenetrable
she have now
restricted herself to a regime of such
ferocious introspection that we be
all at we wit end



the household continue at she
instruction to observe the ritual
now so familiar to she in a vain
attempt to render vivid that which can
never be revived



it will not surprise you to hear
that she continue steadfast in she
refusal to accept any public
engagement however trivial



family and staff expend all they
effort endeavour to draw she out
of this state of unfetter morbidity
but to no avail
indeed doctor
jenner will not undertake to vouchsafe
she sanity unless some remedy be
find



we must hope therefore that this
mr brown will appeal to the queen
sentimental though deeplyheld view
that all highlander be good for the
health
if she can at least be
persuade to take the air the
prospect of far recovery may seem
less remote

sorry madam



he be arriving by boat this
afternoon by which time it be hope
she majesty will be in a fit state to
consider riding out



as to that decision along with

mr brown

madam

honest to god i never think to see
you in such a state
you must miss
he dreadfully

you do not he
get he out
get he out
get he out

so the day they arrive she greet the
sultan and he family with barely a
word and then retire to she chamber
the sultan not used to state
occasion without a head of state be
standing in the lobby waiting for
someone to tell he what to do
but
the court be under strict instruction
not to talk in the corridor so nobody
speak to he not a live soul for
the whole afternoon
so now it be
dinner and everyone standing round
the table still not a word
waiting for she majesty to arrive
one hour go by two the sultan
get a wee bit peckish to say the
least
so finally he wee laddy
break for the cold meat and stuff a
slice in he mouth
well the uproar
when she hear
you would have think
someone have stolen the crown jewel

so

so there be rule
thing you do
and thing you do not do

i be just telling the woman how i
feel for god sake

you do not tell she majesty how you
feel

i speak as i find archie

not down south you do not

so what do ponsonby do when she
start shouting

i think he nearly rupture he truss

how much

seventy a year

not bad not bad

how about yourself

sixty

that be pretty good for a ghillie

prince leopold
be he the one who
bleed all day
so what do his
valet do
wash he poultice for he

it be good than shovel horse
shit

if you be looking for promotion you
should have pick one of the
healthy one

she be hardly a full hamper herself

it be only grief make she like she be

three year john
be that not a bit
long to be grieve

she loved he

come on man
there be love and
there be

what

you know what i mean

i be not sure i do archie

there be love and there be behave like
you do because there be nobody to tell
you not to

which one of we be she flirt with

the goodlooking one

aye
then she be obviously not get
enough to do

you work the system right you could
ask she yourself
just be thankful
you be not working for household
the
queen never let we they out of she
sight
but wee spat like we can slip
through the net easy

i be no wee spit

as if she have not seem he
early
who be that

it be mr brown madam

what be he do there

he appear to be
standing by his
horse

i make no request to go out riding
today
how long have he be there

i do not know madam
he be observed early i believe

sir henry mr brown be standing in the
courtyard
i have no wish to go
riding

i be very sorry madam
i can not
imagine he be certainly given no
instruction

please make sure it do not happen
again

of course at once

what on earth do you think you be
do

await i order

you do not report for duty unless the
queen request it
you know that very
well

i do not come all this way to sit on
i arse

you will await you order like
everyone else
unless you prefer a
repeat of yesterday little
excitement

no

i beg you pardon

i think i make myself perfectly
clear
you do not leave you room
until she majesty request it

eye straight ahead
shouting back
well you tell she majesty from i if
she husband be here now he would have
have she out of that house and get
some air in she
what the hello the
point in i be here otherwise

go inside at once

be that the queens request

yes it most certainly be

mr brown

yes madam

you have be tell repeatedly not to
stand in the courtyard unless
requested to do so

yes madam

then why do you persist in do it

because i think she majesty be wrong
if ever there be a poor soul who
needed fresh air it be she

the queen will ride out if and when
she choose

and i intend to be there when she be
ready

prince albert be going to build a
bench here
he think it one of the
good view in osborne

it be a fine spot madam

he think so yes

in everything i do and everything i
say i try to think as much as
possible what he would do or say if
he be here now
i private
secretary wish i to return to
public duty

if prince albert be here today he would
tell he a thing or two

sir henry be not alone
they all wish
it
the same people who refused to grant
i husband the title of king because
he be deem of insufficient rank

it be a fine spot for a bench be it
not

aye madam

yes

i have some letter in the saddle bag
i wish to read they

i cannot read they like that

you will hand they to i as i require

mr
carter the head butler sit
there

not now he do not
this be i place

by whose authority

i own

the order of seat at the upper
servant table be arranged personally
by the queen herself

that be a tautology lad
unable to stop himself
seriously explaining it
if you say the queen arrange
something you have no need to say she be
do it personally
that be
understood

be you dresser to she majesty

assistant sir yes

what be you name

mary taylor sir

have i see you up in balmoral mary

i hope to go up next year

you would not happen to know what the
queen reading for recreation would
you mary

lord tennyson sir

be i the only one eating

lord clarendon arrive by invitation
at eleven of the clock follow at twelve
by a picnic in the ground to
celebrate princess alices birthday
dispatch as usual at two
the chancellor write to say that by
happy coincidence he will be in cowes
for the weekend
he ask if you
majesty might grant he an audience

why

he think perhaps you majesty
might wish to be informed of the
late development in government

no
i shall be out walking

then perhaps you majesty might
consider it opportune if the prince of
wales be to meet he on you behalf

on no account

mama i really do think it be time we
make ourselves a little more
available

i think we must accept we position in
the country be not entirely unrelated
to the continue absence of the
monarchy from public life
i think perhaps we might consider a
small gesture of some kind

gesture

i think a dinner for we
ambassador perhaps

no dinner bertie
why be you dressed for outdoors

it be so infernally cold in here

cold be good
be that not so dr
jenner

i be sorry madam

cold be good

excellent madam excellent
but perhaps if she majesty be to
consider accompanying she newfound
physical vigor with the benefit of
mental activity

why be i be lecture in this way

forgive i you majesty
in no way
do i wish to suggest

i will not tolerate anybody lecturing
i about the responsibility of the
monarchy

mother

least of all i son
it be his
irresponsibility that drive i husband
to he grave

if it be inconvenient to she majesty
then perhaps she might consider
allow the prince of wales to host

i do believe they send so many box
to taunt i
doctor jenner write to they to say
that i nerve be in an extremely
fragile state and yet they continue to
hound i with box after box after box
after box after box

i wish to take the princess for a
swim

the turn i have be taking in the
ground have prove most beneficial to
i and brown think that salt water
will do i good

do not potter child
swim

you could buy that lot for garden
ornament and still see change from
ten guinea

lift you foot woman



this nation be fortunate in so much as
it be not govern by force





but by a chain of tradition that
have be cherish from generation to
generation because in they in we
tradition be embody all the
law which have enable we to create
the great empire of modern time

but even though we have amass
great capital and even though we have
established an industry with no
parallel in the world yet all these
mighty creation be as nothing
compare to the invisible custom that
shape we live
to those honorable
gentleman of the opposition who seek
to destroy the essential element of
this country i say let they remember
england cannot begin again

have you see this

should we take it seriously

the cartoon or she Majestys
absenteeism

well both

the question be do we need she

surely you be not suggest we
dispense

i dear stanley a prime minister with
only a handful of friend must respect
public opinion

gossip count
lord aberdeen be
right
this country be not govern
by wisdom but by talk
grant it would not take much to
winkle the old girl out of mourn
but if public opinion be against she
then it do not do to appear too
close

so

we will see which way the wind blow

i heart in the highlands i heart
be not here
i heart in the
highlands achasing the deer
chase
the wild deer and following the roe
i heart in the highland wherever i
go

one box of biscuit one box of drop
tablet one box of praline sixteen
chocolate sponge
it be the same
order every week but do anybody
bother to check it
now she have to
travel all the way to balmoral without
the few luxury she actually enjoy

so
Someonell send it on ahead

aye but will they

john it be not you problem what she
eat

the woman surround by fool
she have to be pack and ready to
leave by seven thirty tomorrow
morning
knowing that lot they will
still be dress she at eight

she be get an army of people to get she
up and out

but i be the only one she trust

she will blow hot and cold on you john
she always do
you want to be
careful

i be on ninety pound a year plus
seventy pound for a pile of tartan
i would be wearing anyway
that be as much
as a of the back stairs get and
that job only for toff
raising he hip flask
triumphantly at the sea
i be she Majestys highland servant
indoors and out
there be no stop
i now

oh god not the pipe

what be those

what

those over there there

horse chestnut tree

Craobhangeanmchnofhiadhaich

Craobhangeanmchno
how can i possibly say that with a
straight face

i be think of publishing i
highland journal


be they worth read

i be tell so

who by

sir henry ponsonby tell i they be
charming

what do he know about the highlands

he have be attending at balmoral for
many year

that do not make he an expert

he remark be directed at the
quality of the write not it
subject

i do not groom a horse to have it
admire by other i groom it because
it need grooming

i do not do it for other
but
ponsonby think they be good

just say what you have to say woman
what other people think should not
matter to you

of course i shall say what i have to
say
i always do

aye well if all you want be a good
opinion then he would be sure to oblige
you

what mr ponsonby be appreciate be
they literary merit a skill not
intimately associated with the
knowledge of groom
literary appreciation do not begin
and end with tennyson

i mention you in they

in particular the occasion when
albert be alive
the royal carriage
overturned during a storm and you
demonstrated such loyal service in
returning the queen and the princess
safely to balmoral

for friendship

she will be away on friday between eight
of the clock and six in the evening to
visit the grant in Glasalt
if she be
to make the journey there and back in
the day she be to have no distraction
the night before
she will take a light
supper alone in she private draw
room and retire early

she will need to sign dispatch before
she retire

that can wait till the weekend

there be important paper from

it can wait
anything else

be you sure she majesty be up to such
a long journey
she have only just
recovered from a severe head cold

if i think she be not up to it i
would not let she go would i

surely it be for the gentleman to
decide when to stop

it be a disgusting habit bertie
it
should be discouraged

yes but be not midnight a little
excessive

it be quite late enough

but mama the room be build expressly
for that purpose
it have be a
smokingroom by tradition ever since
father

brown responsibility be onerous
enough already
he have far too much
to do without have to stay up all
night waiting for you to go to bed
the smokingroom will be closed and
the light put out at twelve of the clock

mama

and that be i last word on the
matter

well i be sorry but i really do think
it be too much that the gentleman of
the house should be dictated to by a
servant

it be the queens decision

i beg you pardon
mama

i think you should go now
you have tired you mother enough

there be really no need for this

i will not have she seeing it like it
be
i know she mean well but i wish
she would warn we she be coming

she think if she warn you you would go
pouring water on the fire and stuff
the knitting under the sofa

aye well you can not stop a wife be
houseproud

all right
show she in

they be ready now

lord salisbury

foolish
because she look after the

care of themselves

and in you opinion
be she foolish

mr brown

la superstition meet le monde entier en
flammes

i beg you pardon

personal assistant if he do not

family set get steal last summer

oh i be so sorry

the mane word be not to be credit
he be an arriviste of the very low
water
she be have a bust cast of he
in
nero Marquino marble

i see

i would talk to she myself but she
will not listen to i
she must be
persuade by someone she respect to
abandon this ridiculous favoritism
before a situation develop

situation

i do not imagine you frequent the
republican club
but the fact that
neither you nor i be member should
not blind we to the significance of
they existence
the tory party have always be we
party

i be flatter you think so

i tell you if we do not stick together
on this you could find yourself first
president opposition
du Royaum uni

quite

i do not think we can overstate the
seriousness of this

what do he want

to know when he will be king

so grant here and myself be
riding over lochnagar and the raines
pouring down in sheet and all we be

majesty

i do not doubt that the queen be
highly amuse
she have always have a
very healthy sense of humor

this be a slur on she good name

that the public have a right to it
interest in you

nobody have any right over i

direction

to be follow by a visit from

she be keen to secure
a place for she niece as maid of

i be tire

there be one other matter

what be it

i have a letter madam

from whom

from princess helena and other member
of you family

i family be quite capable of
communicating with the queen in
person

what do they want

they be demanding the dismissal of
john brown on ground of drunkeness

you wished to see i madam

i husband tried always to make i
think more subtly
of course he
taught i so much and i can never
repay i debt to he or the love i
feel even now
but in truth i
think i be someone who can only feel
thing while they be alive to i
for that reason i know i do not have
a subtle mind
i know that
but i
work hard and i try to do i duty
she hesitate
she be
struggling now
however i have notice of late that
i feeling of grief be not so strong
and that i find myself leaning more
upon the comfort of live friend
friends close to i now

you majesty a settle resignation be
more last proof of affection than
active grief
if the good lord see
fit to bring one into contact with
congenial fellow being one should
not analyze one reaction too deeply
to allow oneself to be comfort by
someone else need not imply any
disloyalty to the memory of the love
one

sir henry

madam

please tell the princess and other
signatory to this letter that the
queen will not be dictated to or make
to alter in any way what she have
find to answer for she comfort

yes madam

have someone see to those bruise

yes madam

madam

yes

have considered i position here at
court i have come to the conclusion
that it be in the good interest of
you majesty that i should resign

i do not accept

i have foresee that you would not
but you majesty should understand
that i mind will not be changed in
this
i leave for deeside

the queen forbid it
i cannot allow it because i cannot
live without you
without you i
cannot find the strength to be who i
must be
please

promise i you will not let they send i
back

i promise





yesterday gladstone talk for three
hour on the irish church bill
i
be as guilty as the rest of
underestimate he reform zeal
tory day may be numbered but i fancy
there yet remains one last hope of
deliverance
wheresoever the blame
lie we must now close rank and
defend mrs browns england
as for i
interminable journey to the land of
calvin oatcake and sulphur



no prime minister make great
sacrifice than attempting to run the
country six hundred mile north of
civilization

how dare the irish break with the
anglican
if albert be alive today he would
never allow the crown to give up
church patronage
no the irish must
be tell very firmly to stay exactly
where they be
it be the thin edge
of the wedge mr disraeli
next you
will be telling i that the crown no
longer govern this nation

you majesty remains at the very
epicenter of governance
as for you
people look no far than the sales
of you highland journal to see in
what affection the nation hold they
queen
you sell even more copy than mr
dickens

but i lack you prose mr disraeli

of course i understand you concern
you miss you people
and they miss you

then they may read about i

indeed and for that they be
eternally grateful

be that not enough

in so many way
and yet it be you
presence they crave
figurehead

i never think to be bully by you
mr disraeli
you i think
understood a widow grief

forgive i madam i cannot speak for
the nation only for myself
as prime
minister i confess i miss you
presence but that be only an
expression of i own selfish desire
and i should not burden you with it

i stay here because i be happy
be that such a terrible crime

no madam

time for you walk

this be i good john brown

yes

i have ask he to show you a little
of highland life while you be with we
at balmoral

what bring you here

man can refuse only so many
invitation from he queen
it be
remiss of i not to come early

what do you know about the highlands

i be a blank sheet

do you hunt

occasionally

dare say you can be taught

to shoot perhaps but not to kill

if you hunt you kill

well then i will do i good

demonstrate with his
rifle
always remember you keep it tight to
you shoulder you absorb the kick
aim for the head
then imagine it be
gladstone

do you see any irish assassin today
mr brown

we hear the dog be fenian
sympathizer

or be it the stag

there be not a soul here care about
that wee woman safety except i
she would die in a ditch if i be not there
to look out for she

what be this

it be a diary

be careful who see it

what do you take i for

you should have someone look after
you

i be all right
i just need to rest up
a wee bit
the room
you do not have to stay

the place be a mess

i can not move to tidy

it be what the maid be for

i be not have some prattler going
through i thing

will not you give yourself a rest john
she be other people to look out for
she

she need i archie
she canna do
without i she said it to i face
he hand come up to cover
he eye
how can i stop now

you send for i

i have be called back to london
i
last day
i think i might take a
walk on lochnagar

prince and lords be but the breath
of king an honest mane the nobl
work of god
you must miss such magnificent view

i do not think about it

forgive i i have called you out and
you should have be resting

i be fine

you be injured

it be nothing

still someone must attend you
you
wife should not have let you out

i be not marry

oh

this be the top

i confess i sometimes feel as if i be
not marry myself i see i wife so
little
but i be forget the
reward

the look on they face when one walk
into the room
still give one a
ridiculous thrill

i would not know

surely

what i do i do for i queen

be there never ambition

maybe once

then i envy yo

why

to have achieve one ambition or to
have reconciled oneself to it limit
be a lifetime work

i do what i do

for she majesty

aye

but yourself
what about john brown

i said
i serve the queen

no other aspiration

to see she safe

you will not be unaware of the threat
now pose by republicanism

why do you think i keep she here

ah but therein lie the paradox
it
be she very isolation that encourage
the malcontent
the long she be
away the strong they become
and
who honestly can promise security
against that
however many door you
lock someone will always get in
even here

so

the truth be the queen would be safe
do she duty and returning south to
she public
john bull love she and
john bull be she good defense

she mind be set
she will not change
now

she trust you john

they do not see it

see what

the threat
i tell they but they do not see it

they be not as watchful as you

too busy looking after themselves

the greasy pole

no loyalty

no love

i promised to protect she from people
like you

for once in i life i be not the
issue

she will never understand it

in time she will

she will think i betrayed she

but other will know that you act
for the great good

i received a letter today from mr
disraeli
parliament be calling for
i return to public duty
why will not they let we be

he insist that the country expect i
to preside over the open of the new
session
i refuse to offer sustenance
to enable he weaken grip
besides you know how much i should
hate it
it frighten i

john

we can not always have what we wish

duty
you talk about duty

if duty and safety be serve by the
same end then aye i do

i cannot believe you be saying this
you who i have rely on all this
time

have i ever let you down before

you stand there and tell i it be
i duty
after all you promised i

i be breaking no promise

you be forcing i to do the very
thing you know i fear most

for god sake woman i be just trying
to keep you safe

i will not hear any more about i
safety
you make i a promise and
now you have broken it

when i take you out riding come
rain or shine because i know it be
right for you when i keep the bairn
off you back so you could have a bit
of peace when i see you safe from
home to home and you do not even know
i be there
all i have ever think
about be you

then why send i back to they

because i have to
pause
will you no listen to i woman

do not presume to talk to you queen
in that manner

doctor jenner i feel unwell
i shall
retire to i chamber
please attend
i presently



may i say how glad i be to see you
majesty so much recovered

where be i son

prince albert be at windsor madam

why be he not here

he be sick madam

then why be you not with he

you ordered all member of the royal
family to attend you at balmoral

what be the matter with he

he have typhoid fever madam

no
you be mistaken
prince albert
i husband have typhoid fever
i
ask what be wrong with i son

the same you majesty

why be i not informed

i do not consider it wise in the
circumstance to tax you nerve

how i will be he

alex

he be not well madam

i must go to he

we must leave at once

well

should the good lord see fit to spare
i son i will order a mass to be
celebrated at st
georges
the
people must share with they queen
she prayer and hope for they future
king

the queen will be riding to st
georges on the fifth

i recommend she majesty use the
covered carriage with a full horse
guard
in the event of any
disturbance i will ensure

i will ride to st
georges in an open
carriage
it be time the queen be
see by she public



praise and magnify thou glorious
name for that thou have raised thou
servant albert edward prince of wales
from the bed of sickness
we pray thou to perfect the recovery
of thou servant and to crown he day by
day with more abundant blessing both
for body and soul through jesus
christ we lord



amen





so there he be arthur OConner

all seven stone of the man
paddle madly towards we through a
sea of horse guard waving something
that look vaguely like a pen
i
think he must be one of the mother
ardent readership in search of the
royal indenture

i believe i see he first and then
alerted brown
i be not convinced that
he be not taking a snooze on top of
the box
anyway we have we man
pinned down and i must say brown
acquit himself admirably
of
course the gun be a fake but all the
same it be well do

i intend brown to be rewarded with a
special medal cast in gold
it will
be called the devoted service medal

toast
victoria regina

victoria regina



the people of england have expressed
in a manner which cannot be mistaken
that they will uphold the ancient
monarchy of england

if the first great object of the
tory party be to maintain the
institution of the country the
second be in i opinion to maintain
the empire of england
the
hereditary the traditionary policy of
the tory party
go to you home
teach they these truth which will
soon be imprinted on the conscience of
the land





we should not live in expectation of
contentment
fifteen year of
vigilance will not guarantee peace of
mind
yesterday intruder be again
report in the south wing
i believe
i prompt arrival may have avert any
crisis but it be a timely reminder
it be a great comfort to i that i
effort in secure the queens safety
over the year have not be in vain
certainly she majesty send i no word
that she be dissatisfied
and i feel
sure that if she be unhappy she
would have find the occasion to
speak to i in person as she have so
often do in the past

what be it

north wood sir

god save the queen

believe they will never stop
endless
letter

i know i have not always be the
loyal friend you deserved john
and
yet here i be now even now feeling
desperate at the thought of losing
you

do not be silly woman

not too near

erysipela

few day
when he hear the prince of wales
threw the bust from the window of the
royal gallery

gather the fragment

of he
