first be bearded nearly thirty a man in every
facet

and attitude
exuberant handsome
and at just this
moment bound over a low stone wall with a boisterous
cry
they battle across an expanse of turf thick with dew
girard be the more polish combatant
but dArtagnan be
nearly a force of nature
he whip he sword through the
air with wildhearted abandon
he tumble and somer
saults
this be fun
girard and dArtagnan cross the field pass over a wooden
fence struggle toward a stable and hayloft
as they
fight both man utilize a variety of prop
handful of
hay a wooden spar quick kick from heavy boot
anything go as the sword cut through the air
DArtagnan gain increase advantage force girard
up against a peaceful country manor
girard seemingly
cornered execute a gymnastic flip onto the roof
fight from this high angle
DArtagnan merely smile
and follow

see briefly in silhouette against the rise sun girard
and dArtagnan scramble up the vshaped rooftop pause
to exchange swipe at the peak then slide down the other
side attack defending as they go

inside the manor house a of forty glance
up from she write table hear on the roof
she react curious not afraid and step to an open
window
as if to follow the footstep to the other side


girard leap to the ground first land in an en
closure filled with
DArtagnan fly
after
the goose scatter dArtagnan whose wild
progress frequently resemble that of a young colt
stumble briefly
girard seek advantage thrust his
sword toward the young mane heart
but dArtagnan
parry the blow with a heavy gloved hand roll over
the offend goose glance deadpan apology and
rise to fight again
the epic battle continue
Girards modest success de
volves into desperate flight
DArtagnans seemingly

moving up the country road
he run
toward the cart leap upon it turn back to dArtagnan

when the young gascon execute a nearly impossible leap
to join he
and still they battle the clash of sword a kind of

ing all combined into a dazzlingly heroic display
just
then
the haycart cross a wooden plank bridge

grace or rather as much grace as the muddy situation
will allow

get it





i said queen be no different
than a barmaid in the dark
though
less
practice in the art of
pleasure


if you be going to be a proper
musketeer you will have to learn
the manly art of wenching
right
lady

ahh very good
you first
subject
but you will need
instruction
watch closely

the secret to wenching be the
first kiss
for in that kiss a
last impression be make
if it
be weak she will think you be
weak
and if it be comical she
will think you be a clown
with
i

weak
weak
comical
clown

very good
and as a musketeer be
never weak and only rarely a
clown you first kiss must be all
the thing that you be
like
this




you may speak first if you like
you name she name an endearment
or two
but word be usually a
waste of time

only if you do not know which word
to say

word may make a more last
impression than a thousand of
Porthos kiss

not likely

i will demonstrate
please
sit
beside i

shall i compare thou to a
summer day
thou art more lovely and more
temperate
rough wind do shake the darling
bud of may
and summer leash hath all too
short a date
sometime too hot the eye of heaven
shine
and often be he gold complexion
dim
and every fair from fair sometimes
decline
by chance or nature change
course untrimmed
but thou eternal summer shall not
fade




nor lose possession of that fair
thou owest
nor shall death brag thou
wanderest in he shade
when in eternal line to time thou
growest
so long as man can breathe or eye
can see
so long life this and this give
life to thou


shakespeare

that be cheating

one of the
count of berry
i native
province

about you age he fell in love
with a visitor from paris

breathtaking girl of seventeen
she be more than beautiful
dArtagnan
she be
intoxicate
and this man the
poor idiot he married she

be not that what people do when
they fall in love

be quiet and listen
the count take she to he castle
and make she the first lady of the
province
they be happy for a
time as happy as a man and a
woman can be
then one day while
riding in the wood the girl be
throw from she horse and knock
unconscious
the count hurried to
help she
she dress be torn




on she she arm the woman wear a
gold band in the shape of a
serpent

of clthe she refused to remove

the count angel turned out to be
a murderess who escaped the
executioner blade
she swear
that she loved he

she have changed
and if he would
just keep she secret they would
live a long life together

but the count be young and he be

ridicule of he social class
and
so he rejected she
for she lie
and for she past
and turned she over to the
authority to be executed for the
crime

but you see

i love
be a matter of state
it be complicate

do you think about he all the
time

as queen i mind touch on many

Richelieus last
encounter with louis
you king

of course
as you eminence have
be kind enough to advise i
it be the least i can do

i be worry about the king
happiness

what do you mean

the huguenot rebellion occupation
in the antilles and cayenne
the
coming war with france
these be
not the usual hobby of youth

no




and now he wish to postpone his
birthday celebration

why

he feel it be not
appropriate

it sound as though he be
concern with more important
matter

which be exactly why we must
celebrate
to show the world that the king of
france be strong enough to face
any enemy on any field
to show
france
that he be king
he will listen to you
if you
will speak

i will speak to he

now if you will excuse i i

of course

you majesty
please understand that i do not
underestimate the value of you
assistance




and that i wish for you to
consider in fact to know
all that you and i might
accomplish
together
quietly as if
to justify
for france









i be sorry to be late you
majesty but i be wrestling with
an important matter of state

why be it i do not see any of i
musketeer

i be afraid
that be impossible

why




they have become outlaw
they
be terrorize the countryside
rob and killing innocent
people

there must be some mistake

no mistake
i have report from
the local constable involved

musketeer

they be well off disband

you eminence i have be hearing
some very trouble rumor about
you

there be so many to choose from
be it the one about i allege
alliance with buckingham
let we
see if i remember it correctly
while the english attack from
without i will undermine the throne
from within depose you and
become sovereign of france myself
that rumor you majesty

it do seem rather farfetched




if there be any doubt of i
loyalty they will be put to rest
when we appear together at you
birthday celebration

i have be think about that

birthday celebration when we be
on the brink of war

alert ready for
this as well
you subject be eager to
celebrate the birth of they king
at a time like this

i be not so eager

i have an idea
why do not you
discuss the matter with you

i horse will not survive another
league

and you

ten twenty at the most

hand outstretched
demanding

or two about protection

there be those who would call
that treason

happily no such objection have
be raised
here

all right
i will object

i be listening

let we see
you be by you dress
and by you manner member of a
bonelazy class of servile ninnyhammers
whose slavish allegiance to his
eminence the cardinal be as that
of a dog who like nothing good
than to sniff today where he have
pee the day before




piss be piss no matter what robe
surround it

of a great master than a beef
witted moron so dazzled by the
throne that he do not see the
true nature of the foolish boy
who wobble atop it
which be to
say that most muddybrained of
all man
a musketeer

maybe there be something about we
that just piss people off
at
least i would like to think so
it be
too bad we can only kill they
once





i have be called a lot of thing
in i time

eye on the
opposite shore

the forest
around they be dark and primeval

do you think we have lost they

they will catch up eventually
to the point as always
DArtagnan pause to look at
they beautiful surroundings remember

i father used to hunt in a forest
like this

on i tenth birthday
i do not know

something
about a boy becoming a man
i would
lay in bed at night and imagine it

before i could go with he
athos be unmoved or so it would seem
he reply with
quiet cynicism

well

at last
the dark forest
the
thrill of the hunt
the nearness
of death
only dArtagnan be the hunt not the hunter

life of a musketeer

have to go looking for experience
dArtagnan

enough
and when it do it

athos ride into the forest
DArtagnan hurry to
follow




athos lead dArtagnan through the forest
sunbeam
shoot down through thick branch like golden bar

pastoral set almost peaceful
and then


athos and dArtagnan turn in surprise see
through the glade

athos and dArtagnan through the dense forest
the horesmen as they ride

the top
the climb be fast and treacherous all
around they
athos horse be strike by a bullet stag
ger forward
and collapse just as they reach the
crest
DArtagnan leap off he horse take cover with
athos behind the boulder
athos take aim a
and kill one of the horseman below
the other
curse leap from they mount seek cover

back and forth like angry hornet
stalemate but not for long
they be badly outnumber
the horseman creep slowly up the hillside from tree to
tree
athos turn to dArtagnan as he reload

i will hold they off for as long as

dArtagnan a chance to see

but
athos reload below
DArtagnan recognize the
kindness he have received
that athos cannot fully express
it
and that there be no use argue with he
