damn it man
you can not bury those
feeling forever

two year
nearly two year of i
life
looking for the remain of
that monkey
a piece of he
legendary golden hoop rod
or
some sign of the lose city
nine man perished on the journey
rest of we nearly die from
starvation or one of the many
horrible deseases we discovered
look back to paper
in a near whisper
we still come back empty hand

threading the
projector
one must not give up so easily
indiana

give up
marcus we spent
thirteen month in china
another
seven in india

but none in africa

there be no proof
archeological
or anthropological
to indicate
that sun WuKung ever visit
africa

until now

hey
i paper

the woman be dr
clare clarke
the
famous zoologist
she work in
africa study animal in they
natural habitat

very interesting marcus
now if
you will turn the light back on

three week ago dr
clarke
discover that cute little
fellow
Tyki
a pygmy of an
unusual race
unrelated to any
known african tribe

marcus
the light

dr
clarke believe that Tyki come
from the lose civilization of sun
WuKung

what
but how do miss

doctor

doctor Clake
how do she arrive
at such a preposterous hypothesis

the pygmy speak in a language that
have no african origin
but bear a
strong resemblance to chinese

mean nothing
the river of africa
have be plague by various
oriental pirate and scavenger
since the th century
not much evidence marcus

there be more
the pygmy be find
wearing an ornamental peach stone
around he neck
believe to come
from sun WuKungs legendary garden
of immortal peach

marcus there be countless
undiscovered african tribe
all
with various obscure belief and
practice
one tribe may wear peach stone
another may wear banana peel

there be one final bit of
evidence

enlighten i

the pygmy be over year old

that be impossible

dr
clarke have do a considerable
amount of test on the pygmy
clthe
he sandal
everything
be over year old

he be probably wearing he great
grandfather stuff

what do all of this have to do
with i

dr
clarke want to mount an
expedition to find the lose city of
sun WuKung
she be quite familiar
with you reputation
she would like
you to come along

no chance

there will be money involved
the
museum be will to fund the
expedition

sorry marcus
i have burned this
bridge

indiana

marcus

these

you have get to finish something much
more important
you crossed the
threshold over a decade ago
and
it be be tearing at you inside
ever since
i friend if there be even one iota
of truth in dr
clarkes finding
then you can lift the veil of
mystery that have surround this
chinese legend for century
you
may uncover the secret to a lose
civilization
and possibly to
mane never ending search for
immortality

indiana

the single most important adventure
of you life

indiana jones
i be part of this
expedition too

motion to crew
member
i friend also curious about where
we journey to indy

tell we all a bedtime story doctor
jones

long ago
a place known as the
flower fruit mountain in the
chinese province of AoLai
be
strike by lightning
stone monkey
sun WuKung be born

this monkey
he could walk
talk
like human

more than human
he be blessed with
countless heavenly power
but it
be not enough
sun WuKung wanted to
learn the secret of eternal life
of immortality
equip with he golden hoop rod
to protect he sun wu kung
travel the world for many year
learning the secret philosophy
and teaching of eternal youth
eventually he be grant entrance
to heaven
where the jade emperor
give sun wu kung the title of great
sage of the heaven
and permitted
he to oversee the garden of
immortal peach
after several year the stone
monkey return to somewhere on
earth
here he rule an empire
a
civilization of monkey and human
who have life span of many hundred
year
the exact whereabouts of that lose
city have be a mystery for hundreds
of year
until doctor clarke
discover the pygmy

it be uncertain just how much of this
legend be base in reality
nevertheless we be hope to find
some sign of the lose civilization

what about sun wu kung

whatever he be
a stone idol
an
actual monkey
a human being
be
unknown
but he be one of the most
influentual religious figure in
history and he remain be most
likely somewhere in the lose city

sound familiar
