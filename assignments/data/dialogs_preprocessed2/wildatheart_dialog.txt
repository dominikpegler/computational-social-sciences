told i that pretty soon id be
startin to think about sex and
i should talk to she before i do
anything about it

but honey i think you told i
you uncle pooch raped you when
you be thirteen

that be true
uncle pooch be not
really an uncle
he be a business
partner of i daddys
and i mama
never know nothin about i and
he that be for damn sure
he real
name be somethin kind of european
like Pucinski
but everyone just
called he pooch
he come around the
house sometimes when daddy be away
i always figure he be sweet on
mama so when he corner i one
afternoon i be surprise moren
a little

how do it happen peanut
he just
pull out the old toad and let it
croak

you be terrible crude sometimes
sailor you know

i can not hardly understand you when
you talk with one of they more in
you mouth

i said you can be too crude sometimes
i do not think i care for it

sorry sugar
go on and tell i how
old pooch do the deed

well mama be at the busy bee havin
she hair dyed
and i be alone in
the house


uncle pooch come in the side door
through the porch you know
where
i be makin a jelly and banana
sandwich
i remember i have i hair
in curler because i be goin that
night with vicki and cherry ann the
DeSoto sister
uncle pooch must have
known nobody but i be home because
he come right in and put both he
hand on i butt and sorta shove i
up against the counter


do not he say somethin

not really
least not so i recall now

so how do he finally nail you
right
there in the kitchen

no he picked i up


he be short but powerful
with
hairy arm
anyway he carry i
into the maid dayroom which nobody
used
we do it there on an old bed


we do it
Whattaya mean
do not
he force you

well sure
but he be supergentle
you know
i mean he raped i and
all but i guess there be all
different kind of rape
i do not
exactly want he to do it but i
suppose once it start it do not
seem all that terrible
it be over
pretty quick and after uncle pooch
just stand there and pulled up he
trousers and left i there
i
stay in bed till i hear he drive
off
then i just go back into
the kitchen and finish makin i
sandwich

and you never told nobody about it

just you
uncle pooch never act
strange or different after
and he
never do anything else to i
i
always get a nice present from he
at christmas like a coat or jewelry



uncle pooch die in a car crash three
year later while he be holidayin
in myrtle beach

too much traffic there for i taste
and another thing baby
that
government of ours should be keepin
