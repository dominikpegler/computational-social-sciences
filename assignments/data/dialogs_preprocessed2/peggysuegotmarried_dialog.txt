primarily social share be

i want to ask you a question
do you think
time travel be
possible

be you do some kind of science
project

sort of

well
in a newtonian framework
the possibility be limited but
with the advent of relativity
theory the idea of absolute time
can no longer be reasonably
affirm

and then there be richards
burrito

what be that

that be i own theory base on a
mexican food called the burrito
i have it once when i parent take
i to disneyland

Iknow what a burrito be

well i think time be like a
burrito
sometimes it just fold
over on itself and one part touch
the other

what be inside

you can till it with whatever you
want
from illusion to memory
from experience to innocence from
happiness to the entire universe

so you think time travel be
possible
for people

absolutely
people dog
elephant

listen you have get to keep this a
secret
you can not tell a soul
promise
