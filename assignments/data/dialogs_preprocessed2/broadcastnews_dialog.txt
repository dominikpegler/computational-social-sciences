have a theory and the other quote
it in he story as white house
source say

that actually go on

keep talking

yes sure

come on
even i be not that
hard on myself

no i really get this job on a
fluke and wait till you hear where
it end up

i be do sport at the station
the newspaper run this untrue story
that i be leaving and they get all
these ton of protest mail
so they
make i anchor

so great right

except i be no good at what i be be
a success at

how be you at back rub
he

it be sort of normal the way you
feel
in graduate school everyone
think the only mistake the
admission committee make be letting
they in

listen to i
you keep on think
i be somebody ho lack
confidence
that be not it
i know i can talk well
enough and i be not bad at making contact
with people but i do not like the
feeling that i be pretend to be a
reporter
and half the time i do not really get
the news i be talking about
it be not
that i be down on myself
trust i
i stink

i trust you

i do not even have the chance to get
really good at sport
i be not bad
i think i be starting to do
interesting feature but hockey be
big at the station and

what about the obvious remedy
reverse thing
maybe get a
job on a newspaper

i do not write

but that do not stop i from
sending out audition tape to
big station and the network

well come on it be you life
nobody be tying you to the fast
track
do you go to college

one year
almost one year

so you be not well educated and
you have almost no experience and
you can not write

and i be making a fortune

it be hard for i to advise you
since you personify something that
i truly think be dangerous

Uhhuh

i agree with you you be not qualify
so get qualify
you can insist on
be well prepared
you do not have
to just leave it as
i do not write
i be not school
i do not understand the news i be reading
but at least i be upset about it folk


whoa this be a mistake

just what do you want from i anyway
permission to be a fake
stop whining
and do something about it

well you do not have to start right now

now

be right

the same thing happen with this
guy
i have passed some line some
place

because nobody invite a bad
looking idiot to they bedroom

okay
i feel like i be slipping but
do people who be actually slipping
feel that way or be it always the
really good people who be moving up
who invariably think they be slipping
because they standard be so high

joint chief be meeting we have
george Weln at the pentagon

george Weln be at the pentagon where
the attack launch by the lone
libyan pilot have result in a massive
movement of military might

lot of alliteration from anxious
anchor place in powerful post

it be aaron

yes

i think the pilot that shoot down the
libyan in be station right
here
maybe you could get he
and maybe tom should say that we
be one of the hard plane to fly
they be nickname tomcat

thanks
the be one of the most difficult
plane to master
oh you call they tomcat and in
the s the first crop have a number
of crash

george be not the tomcat one of
the most difficult machine for a
pilot to master

one of we hot plane

i say it here it come out there

there be trouble with they in the
early day back in the s

i again
hi

that last cut work
for you bobbie

yes and thank for asking

what can you do
if a woman invite
a man in and he say they uh have
sex and she say he raped she and
then you find out they have be out
together two three time
how can
you prove a crime

it will be a year next month since it
happen
i never think i would talk
about it outside of counseling

hi

we would go out twice and i have not
enjoy myself that much but it get
to a point i do not know if you can
appreciate this but where you do not
want to sit home or be with you
girlfriend and people have always be
telling i that i be too picky

i be not
it be just you want to meet
a nice guy
so anyway it be that
givehimachance thing
no it
be not
i be lonely
so we go
to a movie and when he bring i home
he said could he just come up and have
one beer and then he would go
how do you
say anoa to that
so first it be
this wrestle match which be awful
enough because it get to be really
a fight
because i be a modest person
then he ripped i clothes and he
forced i to
make love
he stay in
i apartment and forced i more time
he do not leave until
i promised myself i would not cry
it be just hard not to
you sure have a sympathetic face
i be so sure i would not do this
but the whole thing mess i up
maybe more than it should

can i turn on the news for a second
oh wait a minute
sex tear
this must be the news

i do not think you can overestimate it
on any give saturday night tens of
thousands of woman be be attack
and there be not much they or we can do
about it

the victim often remain too terrify
to talk the police powerless and all
the social welfare group can finally do
be monitor this epidemic of crime without
punishment
this be tom Grunick in
annandale virginia

i be in a pissy mood
i be sorry

what be wrong with it

nothing
i think you really blow
the lid off nookie

nice work
i have get to get a crew off the clock

so what do you think

it moved i
i do relate to it i
really do
it be unusual for you to
cut to yourself when you tear up and
that might not have be i choice
but
it be real and it get i
and i think a
lot of the time i be too conservative about
that kind of stuff
okay

yeah

tomorrow the jury return to this
site as each day bring more revelation
of horror four more body now taken
from the freeze earth

i do not know if we have any
young man more respected in we
operation than you

well enough for i to expect that

we know each other well enough
for i to care how i put something
to you which could wipe you out
so i will phrase thing the way i
think they should be phrase
all
right

this i think pauls nervous
about he own job and for some
reason he think you only appeal to

wait
bullshit i a little
i be
beginning to appreciate it

i be no suggest the bad will
happen
but someone with you
brilliance get nibble about other
job and maybe the next time that
happen down the road you should
look into it

god

fire a large number of people
