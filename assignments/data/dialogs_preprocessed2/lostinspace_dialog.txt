roger grissom one this be mars
mining you be clear to land
hope
you get some Partagas in that rust
bucket sal

i bring you the most amazing

SinoJordanian raider

repeat

ranger one this be grissom base
rescue craft have be dispatch

impact in second

grissom this be eagle one
those pug
will never reach he in time

eagle one clear this frequency and
return to base

this be eagle one
i be going after

now

major west you ship be not equip

that be
a direct order
acknowledge

never liked that station anyway

impact in five second

warn

jeb i be going to give you a little
kiss
do not take it the wrong way

don abort
abort

do this mean we be going steady

you be not get out of buy
those beer that easy


imagine an end to world hunger
what
if ample food and clean drink water
be the birthright of all we
planet child

this man professor john robinson
inventor of the fast than light
hyperdrive can make that timeless
dream a reality

john robinson and he family have be
extensively trained to take a ten year
journey across the galaxy in the
world most advance spacecraft
the jupiter

from a distant world the robinsons
will bring back a miracle

Dimondium can turn even worthless sand
to fertile soil
earth be a
garden
what kind of future can we
child look forward to

future without hunger
future
without suffer
heaven on earth

this mission sponsored by the army
and the CocaCola corporation

coke
saving the world for we
child
give i a hitest break

he hack we main power grid to run
he experiment
the school be in
chaos
we do not even have light

this be no laugh matter mrs
robinson
will be terribly gift
he
little time machine though pure
fancy be the product of a truly
brilliant mind

the changing shape of education

no more monkey business

the boy be starved for attention
be
there no way he father could have
attend the science fair

once we have landed on alpha prime we
on board robot will begin construction
of a hypergate

by then technician here on earth
will have completed a companion
hypergate in we planet orbit

once both gate be complete ship
will be able to pass instantaneously
between they
the jupiter can bring
the Dimondium back to earth without
the ten year delay of a return trip

why can not you just use the Jupiters
hyperengine to zap straight to alpha
prime

as you know hyperspace exist beneath
normal space
if you try to enter
hyperspace without a gate

you exit vector be random
there be no
telling where you would come out

professor how be captain daniels
recover from the flu
will we still
be able to pilot the mission

lady and gentleman you come to get
a look at the jupiter one
do not you
think you have wait long enough

professor how do you family feel
about leaving the earth behind

they could not be more excite

this whole mission suck

i do not want to stay home for dinner
i want to see i friend for the last
time

on the eve before she be torn from
she friend kidnap hurl into
deep space against she will what
thought fill the mind of the young
space captive

will there be boy on alpha Centuri
what will i wear

when we wake up in ten year the video
journal of penny robinson space
captive will be devour by millions
i will be world famous
you on the
other hand will have be totally
forgotten

the space captive have decided to wear
ribbon of support for fellow
sufferer as she be drag into deep
space green for the ecological
issue white for human right

you would probably gag if i described the
secondary infection loss of
circulation can because

what be you grinning at

i just find an upside to this
mission
the thought of jettisoning
you body into deep space

dad say do not bring they
like
anything i do matter to he

he never show huh

maybe if i have actually broken the
time barrier he would have paid
attention

do not let he get to you kiddo
he
just get busy with work be all

so that be a no to family dinner

let we see do i spend i last night on
earth watch mom and dad pretend not
to be fighting again or get in ten
year of makingout at the mall
you do the math

mom going to go thermal

what be she going to do
grind i

we be lucky they do not press on
daniels condition

i figure a chance to look at the ship
would keep the dog at bay

ben i be worry about jamming in a
replacement pilot at the last second
i family a on this mission
i need
someone who be more than just spit and
polish

i have get you man
he just do not
know it yet

at ease major

sir why be i pull off active duty
i salvage i craft and Jebs
i will
fight a court martial general

do you know professor robinson

by reputation only
you father battle strategy be
require read at the academy

how much do you know about the jupiter
mission major

the jupiter be fully automate
the
pilot fly the ship out of the solar
system and land on alpha prime
it be
a baby sitting job sir

major you be aware earth resource
be severely limit

every schoolchild know we recycle
technology will save the
environment
sending a family across
the galaxy be a publicity stunt to
sell soda to people of all age

what i be about to tell you be
classified
every schoolchild
have be lie to
the recycle
technology have failed
in
less than two decade earth will be
unable to support human life

we spun the ad campaign to give the
mission a friendly face keep people
from panicking in the street
we
partner with coke because the
billion this mission cost would have
bankrupt the government
the
SinoJordanian alliance know the truth
as well as we do
they hope to reach
alpha prime first and if they do
i guarantee you they will not share
the Dimondium with western demon like
we
we crop will wither
we will be
left to die

captain daniels do not have the
flu do he sir

daniels be murdered in he apartment
last night
the flu story be a cover
we feed the press

dan be a good pilot
good man

you rescue stunt over mars be
foolhardy
explain yourself major

i have a friend in trouble

you endanger a one billion dollar
spacecraft disobey a direct order
because of a friend

yes sir
and i would do it again
sir

he will do

congratulations major you be the new
pilot of the jupiter mission

perhaps a brief jaunt down memory
lane be required
i be contracted
to provide daniels apartment code
i work be do

they find a replacement pilot the
mission be going ahead on schedule

how tragic
for you

we require more direct intervention

i see
well that will cost you
and
i be afraid i price have just become
astronomical

control have not received the result
of you final preflight exam
doctor smith

the robinsons be check out at one
hundred percent
they be in perfect
condition and ready to fly

wish they good luck for i

the mission protocol be simple
professor robinson be in command
unless you encounter a military
emergency
in that case major west
you will assume command

welcome aboard major

some of this technology might be new
to you
i will be happy to explain

cold fusion drive
RamblerKrey life science station

holographic navigational interface

Cryosleep array
fully monitor

sick bay remote op engineering and
live quarter be below deck
Hyperengine should be in here

if you have to baby sit it be not
such a bad nursery would not you
agree major

the cryosleep system be running at
ninety five percent

doctor smith approved the spec

doctor smith be base physician
i be
responsible once this ship be in
flight
these tube have to keep the
crew in suspend animation for ten
year
they will be perfect or this
ship will not launch
be that clear

absolutely doctor

judy i would like you to meet major
west
he be taking mikes place

he be heavy than mike
we will have to
recalibrate

i would be more than happy to discuss i
dimension perhaps over dinner

west i have read about you
something
of a war hero be not you

well yes actually

those who can not think fight
well nice to have meet you

that be one cold fish i would love to
thaw

dinner dad

it be going to be a long flight

he win first prize again
he
practically bring down he entire
school
but he win first prize

nonworking prototype for he time
machine
sharp stuff for a midget

i be sorry about dinner
i have to work
late
the new pilot

what you have to do be prioritize
you family over the mission

maureen
this mission be about we
family
so we can stay together

the perfect nuclear family
the most
stable social unit ideally suited
for the isolation of a long journey
into space
it be all just john
you be never home
judy be
becoming a ghost just like you
penny
can not see past she own navel and will
have to black outhis school just to
get he father attention
the
perfect nuclear family in ruin

i know maureen
i be scare too

how much be
you revenge worth major
i will of
course need you word as an officer
that you will let i live

emergency power on line
i think i
can get these blast shield open

Uhoh

give i a telemetry projection

you be way off course
we show you in
the sun gravitational pull

how long do we have

we count seven minute before you
outer hull begin to melt

i be going to try for the mercury
mine

i will need dr
robinsons portable
gurney
i believe it be stored in

i be on it

we trusted you
you tried to kill we all

existence offer we nothing if not
the opportunity for an endless series
of betrayal
there be a world behind the world
professor robinson

i have rerout all secondary system
to the main drive

she will not budge
short baby sit
mission i have ever do

i family not going die in space

i be open to suggestion

outer hull breach in second

come on child
fight
put a little
heart in it

the life

i save
may be
i own

judy
baby

you should try to look less worry
it have a tendency to spook the
patient

thank you

you be a good woman maureen
any man

the wellbeing of you family be of
great importance to i
perhaps if
you convinced you husband to trust
i

stabilize she smith
because you only
breathe as long as she do

heat seal breach in second

there be get to be some way to get
through this

that be it

what be it

we can not get away from the sun
so we
have to go through it
the hyperdrive

engage the hyperdrive without a gate
we could be throw anywhere in the
galaxy

anywhere but here

we be get resident radiation
distortion from the space craft
she
must be breaking up

let i see those number annie

son of a bitch
he be power up the
hyperdrive

Hyperengines coming on line

warn
heat shield breach

Hyperdrive at percent
major you
have the com

zero to million mile a second in
under a minute
let we see what this
baby can do

we can not keep a fix on she sir
she be
starting to disappear

godspeed

be everyone okay

all in one piece
although major west
have the most puzzle definition of a
smooth ride

judy
where be judy

boy either i cut down on the coffee
or sew in a flap
it be hell get
in and out of this thing

be you

vital be normal
pulse and
respiration seem to be

baby be you okay

i be fine daddy really

will every disaster be an excuse for
familial sentiment
please tell i
now so i may gather up a liberal
supply of space sickness bag

what happen john
where be we

you have i worry doc
nice to see
you thaw

smart maneuver with the hyperdrive

fighter who think what do you
know
you be just in time for the
show

computer map we current location

see anything familiar

search for recognizable
constellation
unable to locate

this computer have star map of the
entire known galaxy

we be lost be not we

what the hell be that

any effect on the ship

no

all the planet have moved

and where do that come from

it be go

no
go back in front of it

it be a hole in space
doorway

doorway to where

if we want to reach that ship we be
going to have to find out

no apparent effect on the ship

i be hail on all frequency
no
response

there be some marking on the
starboard side
can you throw some
light on she

do not know if the exterior spot be
work
there we go

if this in all a dream why can not
there be more girl

i have never see a design like this
what be those scale on she hull

how could earth launch a ship this
massive and neither of we know about
it

it just do not make sense

these scanner be damage i be
get inconsistent life sign but
they may be sensor ghost

maybe she computer still up
i be
trying standard remote access code

what do you know

can you give i some light on the
secondary dock ring

what do you make of that

boy i think we be have a close
encounter

crush

crush
kill
destroy

crush
kill
destroy

crush
kill
destroy

i hack into he bypassed his
main operate system and access
he subroutine
he be basically
running on remote control

show off

and so the space captive find
herself helping the robinsons by
guard the traitor
and she find

she find that out here in the dark
and cold she be scare and she be
kind of glad they be all together

identify yourself soldier

west major united space force
request permission to see the
prisoner

proceed major west

ouch
could he be cute
i do not
think so

these quarter be totally
unacceptable
i demand

we be going to check out the probe
ship
maybe we can figure out how
they get here
and how to get home

tata
have a wonderful trip

you be coming with we

out of the question
i be a doctor not
a space explorer
you and

what you be be a murderous saboteur
and i be not leaving you on this ship
so you can do more harm than you have
already cause

i absolutely refuse

give i an excuse to kill you
please

silver always be i color

when boarding a mysterious
spacecraft it always pay to look
you good

deactivate safety

Voiceprint confirmed
rifle be
active

you do a good job up there son
you
saved we all

thanks

i know i have not around much these
day
that we have not have time to

professor we be ready

will you be the most important thing
in the world to i
i hope one day
you will be able to see that

take care of i dad okay robot

the air be stale
old

that be the smell of ghost

i be interfacing with the on board
computer
odd

not working

no it be just i do not know too
fast
most of the system be down

motion sensor be still work

what do you make of this

some kind of hieroglyphic

if i do not know well i would say this
be blood

i know an omen when i see one
i
suggest a hasty retreat

just imagine we be retreating in the
opposite direction
now move it

dad do you

hear something

like the drip drip drip of blood

you really need to shut up

here

that material appear biological

nothing good will come of this

what make you such an expert

trust i major
evil know evil

let we find the bridge
maybe we can
get some answer

try it now mom

damn

what the hell happen in here

some kind of fire fight
look at this
technology
i have see some of this
before
on the draw board

can you bring up the captain log

the data have degraded
i be going try
and gather any fragment i can
there
be not much but
here we go

jeb

the hyperspace tracker seem to be
function
no sign of the jupiter two

have exceeded we mission timetable
by two
i be not will to give up
don would
keep looking for i

that be it
the rest of the data be
totally corrupted

this do not make sense
how could
they launch a rescue mission for we
when we have only be lost a day

i have get something here

they bring it up from the planet
surface
it be seem to be some sort
of egg sack

smith step away from there

happy to oblige major
although i
do not think it be i you should be
worrying about
but rather this

i be detecting motion
behind you

after it
move
bring smith

this explain where all the plant
come from

growth like this would take decade

unhand i you mechanical moron

do not move

i be sick of you terrorism
if you
be going to kill i be do with
it
otherwise i will insist you treat
i with the respect and

i said do not move

neat

well who do we have here

easy there little buddy
no one
going to hurt you

how do you know it will not hurt we

look like you have make a friend
you
have a good bedside manner major

i be going to let that one go

how charming
doctor dolittle of
outer space

where do you think it come from

it be possible this be one of the
creature represent in the
hieroglyph we see on the wall
it
must have be they ship attached to
the other dock ring

it look like a child

if so i dear major what do you
suppose happen to it parent

let we get back to the bridge

i think i have get it

that be strange

those scale be giving off heat

i have tap into the internal sensor
array
besides we this ship be
totally desert

ghost ship

and the flavor of the day be
bananabeef
who think up these
combination


good

major west i highly recommend you
never breed
that by the way be i
medical opinion

little thing be hungry

good lord who will spare we the
tyranny of the sentimental

do you hear something

get this infernal creature off i

this can not be good

you have a remarkably keen sense
of the obvious

john get the hell out of there

give i an external view

evacuate
now

this joy stick be too slow
activate
holographic interface

they eat they wound

which way

turn left

now right

get to seal the bulkhead

the door control be at the other and
of the corridor

the fire sensor

open damn you

it be cycling a vacuum check
there be
no way to speed up the protocol

fool
i warn you not to come
aboard this curse craft
you have
killed we
you have killed we all

shut up

now that be a bedside manner

charge

will get the robot in here

i can not move he without letting the
spider into the ship

leave he behind

i be sorry robot

seal it
now

get we out of here

get this cloying gargoyle off of i

get i an external view

prepare to disengage

get it off i
get it off

initiating separation

it be okay
Everythings going to be
alright

we be clear
everybody hang on

i think those thing be use the
probe ship as a way to trap food

that i s probably what happen to
the monkey parent
we be going
to be desert

but what happen to the crew

nothing good

we be not out of the wood yet

let we see how these monster like a
hundred thousand volt

and the crowd go wild

recall you nightmare from
childhood major
monster be rarely
so easily dissuade

persistent bastard

can you hit they again

every time i electrify the hull i be
draining we system
once or twice
more and we be going to be dead in
space

fate i fear may be inevitable one
way or another

that be the same expression you have
when i mother come to stay with we

extrapolation coming up
silicone base
Admantium she will and
lack of respiratory system suggest an
ability to live in deep space
tiny
front brain imply communal
relationship
more like bee

there be thousands of those thing

they may be attracted to heat and
light

with the right command code i can
light up the probe ship from here

damn
no response

command code be sequenced
try the next series

but they will not work until the next
fleet of ship be build
that be at
least two year away

just do it

how do you know

think about it don
the ship
advance technology
you friend
looking old
what if that ship be
from we future

warn
outer hull have be
compromise

it be not work

can you get the fusion drive on line

let we turn up the heat

warn
inner hull breach in twenty
second

give they a little encouragement

electrify outer hull
now

get we out of here
fast

what be you do

never leave an enemy stronghold
intact
one of you father first
rule of engagement

don stop
that be a direct order
we
might need to salvage

this be a military emergency
that
mean i be in command

don no
i be ordering you

i hate spider

hang on it i a go to be a bumpy
ride

i can not hold she

we be going down

can not get the stabilizer on line

pull up
pull up

really
no kid
thanks

i be reading a clear ahead
i be
going to try and make it

get to slow we down

brace for impact

everybody by the number

life science still breathing

mission medical i be alive

i too
robotic i mean

video mechanic okay

i be alive major wests poor excuse
for pilote skill not withstand

let we take a look

i do not think we be in kansas
anymore

you violate a direct order

about half the core material be
burned out
we will never generate
enough power to break orbit

i told you not to blow that ship
reactor and you do it anyway

come on professor give it a rest
i
be technically still in command

do not hand i that
i be commander of
this mission

look no offense but you be an
egghead with an honorary rank
no one
ever intended you to handle combat
situation
you be spout some
nonsense about time travel while
those spider pose a continue
threat
i make a judgement call and
if i have to i will make it again
hell you of all people should
understand that
if you father be
here

i father be not here
i father be
dead killed in one of he combat
mission you so admire
i family be
on this ship and you be going to
follow i order
whether you agree
with they or not
be that clear
major

save the speech
i like you
but
the fate of the earth be at stake
here
i be going to do whatever i
think it take to ensure the success
of this mission
with or without you
help
be that clear professor

be i interrupt something

no
really
i think you two should go
ahead and slug it out
i mean here
we be stranded on an alien world and
you boy want to get into a pissing
contest
so please go for it
i will
have judy down here in a heartbeat to
declare you both unfit and i will take
over this mission
now i do not want
to hear another word from you two
until you can play nice
be that
clear

maureen listen

not another word
well
now if you have finished hose
down the deck with testosterone i
suggest you come with i
i may have
find a way to get we off this
planet

wow

tell i about it

can you hear i
robot

system error
robot unable to
register neural net output
unable
to locate motor control
unable

calm down
you body be destroyed in
the conflict with the space spider
do you remember

affirmative

but i download you neural net

robot tried to destroy the robinson
family
why would will robinson save
robot personality
you action do
not compute

i guess sometimes friendship means
acting with you heart not you
head

logic error
friendship do not
compute

do not worry robot
i be going to build
you a new body
i promise

mom always said i should try to make
new friend

the atmosphere here can sustain human
life
i have locate rad
radioactive material a mile north

that be at least what we would need to get
the core functioning again

we will set off at daybreak
it will be
safer
those be i order major

i agree with you recommendation
professor

DZtente be a beautiful thing

what be the diagnosis doc
be it
cowboy or ballerina on halloween

right now she be a girl
but i think
you little pal here be from a
selfreplicating species
at
different stage of life she or he
probably alternate sex

imagine the saving on dating outfit
alone

can i keep she

penny you have never taken care of a
thing in you life besides yourself

please
she be all alone
i promise
i will look after she
she need i

the moment you misplace she or
forget to feed she we leave she on
this planet where she can live in the
wild
i be not kidding penny

we be both a long way from home
be not we little one

that be what we will call you
blip

you like that

nice girl
pretty girl
nice

remove that lock this instant
i
shall not be cage like some animal

i give i word i would let you live
i
never said for how long

these quarter will be fine

tell i major west
be you really
confident in robinsons ability to
guide we
if i be set free i would
support you right to command
with
minimal force we could take this
ship and assure this mission
continue under you leadership

i god smith you be right
how
could i have be so blind
i will just
run and get you a gun so we can
hijack the ship
okay

sarcasm be the recourse of a weak
mind

i be hide the pain
really

i assure you major west
you pain
have just begin

star light star bright

million strange star and only one
wish
i wish we be home

i never think a sky could look so
alien

we really be lost

when the first sailor circle the
globe and see a brand new sky they
think they have sail off the edge
of the earth
but they be really
just around the corner

we just billow we sail and let the
wind blow we home be that it major

so those sailor find familiar
shape in the star to make the sky
more friendly to help they find
they way

that be how constellation be born

porky the wise and mighty pig

the great bucktoothed bunny
bug

so i quarter or yours

excuse i

we be the only single man and woman
of consent age in the galaxy
how
much more of a set up do you need

so you figure just dispense with the
pleasantry get down to business

you have a way with word doctor

right here
on this console

here would be fine

next time fly slow

what be i think bringing we all
out here into space

the world needed saving
you be the
right man for the job

but solving the world problem
do not leave much time for the
people you love do it

do you get any time with will

now he be decided he can rebuild the
robot
want to show i he design
i have get too much to do

funny creature man
you try so hard
not to be you father end up making
the same mistake
will adore you
he need you attention

we can not get off this planet much
less back on course
i do not have
time to

john just listen to he
it do not
matter what he be saying
just listen
sometimes at least in the eye of
they father little boy have to
come first

as soon as we get back into space
we be going to spend some real time
together
i promise

what

it be nice to have we family under
one roof
even if we have to go half
way across the galaxy to manage it

how would you feel about a little
late night tutorial professor

mm
that be new
what be you do

go for extra credit

good night john

good night maureen

good night judy

good night will

good night penny

you guy have get to be kidding

oh man

what be those rumbling
they have
be happening all morning

how can half the landscape have grow
up overnight

okay let we get settled
maureen

it be impossible
but this planet
geothermic plate do not match up

i be afraid of this

i think these tremor be the result
of opening and closing doorway

doorway to where

the future

perhaps the professor be hit on the
head when we landed

remember the portal that lead we to
the probe ship
what if we crossed a
into a time year after earth send a
rescue mission

you be not serious
time travel be
impossible

no it be not
it be just improbable
like hyperdrive be a hundred year
ago
nothing really impossible

this world could be riddle with
doorway to the future

so if we walk into that forest
outside we be really just walking
into this crater year from now

geological plate from different
time would not fit together
that
would explain the tectonic mismatch
but doorway in time john

if these portal be opening and
close part of some cascading
natural phenomenon they could be
tearing this planet apart

these portal be exactly what i
predict i time machine would do
what if the doorway be not natural
machine that bend space like we
hyperdrive could be modified to bend
time as well
what if someone on this
world have build a device

son i appreciate you input but now
be not the time for flight of fancy

you never listen to i
not ever

there be no telling how long before
this planet break up entirely
don and i be going to locate the
radioactive material for the core
get the ship ready to go
we may have
very little time

be not you coming out to say goodbye

you be always leaving
what if

what if one time you do not come
home

whenever you grandfather go away
on a mission hold leave these with
i
for safe keep
and when he get
home i d always be waiting to give
they back

i be coming back will
i promise

i have get a fix on the radioactive
material
it be through the portal

we will just have to hope the doorway
remain stable

these crater wall be disable the
comlinks
you will not be able to
communicate with the ship
maureen
come home to i professor

i love you wife

i be going to regret saying this but
try to get back in one piece

this be kind of a kiss for luck
occasion would not you agree doc

see
i be regret it already
kiss have to be earned
say
goodbye blip

nice girl
pretty girl
nice

you take care of she penny
take care of you too baby

yes enjoy you moment of trite
familial bond

because they will be you last

that be everything even close to
nonessential
even i bellybutton
ring

thanks pen

you want to come on a land survey

look what do dad know
maybe
someone do build a time machine

robot be on line

it sound like old morse code

danger

you said someone be in danger

we all be
you be wise to arm
yourself

this gun be set to fire for i only
so do not try anything funny

william you misjudge i
i only want
to help you

help we
you tried to kill we all

but now we fate be intertwined
if
you father and that idiot west fail
i will have no chance of get
home
it be in i good interest they
succeed
and i always follow i good
interest

what monster roam these alien wild
fool
to set off blindly across this
savage land
much as i hate to admit
it it will be hard to manage
without they

what be you talking about
they will
be back
they will be okay

someone should go after they

will i forbid it
you be a boy

clever one certainly but a child
nonetheless
this planet be likely
full of predator
even if you find
they what if they be hurt ravage
dying what good could you do

but you be a doctor

it be impossible

not really
geologist have
speculate that Dimondium might be
naturally occurring in many old
world
part of a biosphere way of
rejuvenate itself

this one be ten time more powerful
then that on alpha prime
there be
enough here to save earth

after much deliberation the space
captive have decided to accept she new
role as member of the crew
the
robinsons after all can obviously
use she help

now look what you have do
stop
hanging all over i

blip
wait
i be sorry
damn

i have get a fix on dad suit beacon

wow that be mom favorite color

how droll

run child run

will
will

wow

william wait

see over here i be in the future
here i be in the past
do not worry
if i theory be correct these
doorway should remain stable for
a while anyway

i can barely contain i glee
why
be not you age like the plant

that be just an effect of the portal
form
once they stabilize you can
cross from one time to another
just like step between two
room
dad signal be this way
come on
doctor smith

what do you find

come come son no time for
distraction
let we move on

damn

damn
damn be not good

the radiation signature we have be
tracking
it be a ghost

reflection from the jupiter two
bouncing off the ore in these wall
there be no core material here

the ship back that way
we have to
go through

blip
i be sorry
blip

blip wait

blip you can not run off like that
what the

some kind of fight in space
it
almost look like the probe ship
major west blow up

that could be the jupiter two crash
land

blip no

nice girl
pretty girl
nice

we should be able to see the ship

could these be from the probe

corrode
this metal be decade old

it be not possible

what kind of nightmare be this
where the hell be we

no major when the hell be we

i feel like we get turn around

just follow you father signal
young william

oh shit

boy of you intelligence should not
swear

look

oh
shit indeed


well well
all thing really do
come to he who wait

what be this place

why professor the shock must have
scrambled you brain
look around
you
do not you recognize the spot
you have come home

this can not be

what have you do to the ship
where be i family

you family be dead
dead and in the
ground

no

what fickle consort in memory
time
dim certain image while other
shine clear and bright as yesterday

i will never forget that morning
twenty year ago
what be it you
said
i will be back
i promise
but i
know well
you never come home

without you you family never have a
chance
few spidersv survive the
destruction of the probe ship
they
reach the planet and attacked
i
can still hear the woman scream

who be you

do not you recognize i dad
it be
i
i be you son
will

penny
penny

penny
baby be you alright

it be okay mom
they be not going to
hurt we
it be like they think i be
they princess or something


best as i can tell this whole clan
be spawn by this single creature
we have be a busy girl have not we
but

speak doctor

each creature seem to have unique
corpuscular pattern on they palm
as individual an fingerprint no
two alike
except

except the print on this giant
creature and we little blip
match exactly
do not they

how do you know

because i think blip and we friend
here be actually one and the same

father i give you
eternity




ouch
who ordered i that last
drink
what the hell be going on

i think we crossed into we own
future
we have come back to the
jupiter two decade after we left

look father what i flight of
fancy have wrought
i used you
hypergate to build i time machine

over the year i have struggle in
vain to harness the awesome power of
time
all i experiment at create
a stable doorway have be futile
until now
today you will witness i
ultimate triumph

the core material
if we could get
that back to we jupiter two

the doorway in time that lead we
here must be a side effect of he
machine coming on line
like stream
running into the ocean

once this core material in fully
introduced into the control console
i will open a doorway stable enough
for one person to take one trip
through time and space as well
today i will change history

i will return home to the very day
you take we on this curse mission
i will stop we from taking off
i will
do what you never could
i will save
the family
i will save we all

look around
you machine be ripping this planet
wave you ride home have the same
effect on earth
what if in get
home you destroy earth in the
process

i be going home
i be going to save
the family

will i be you father
you have get to
listen to i

let i tell you about i father
i
father be a walk ghost
never
there when i needed he
he drag
he family into deep dark space and
lost they there
i father be not
coming to the rescue

we have get to go inside

slow down now
we can not know what
wait inside that ravage craft
but
we can be confidant it be nothing
good
and i for one be frighten

but dad in there

will listen to i
i have cross
this world with you find you
father as promise
but i can not let
you go in there unarmed

but i have get a gun

if we go forward the bare of that
weapon must be ready to kill
murder
be a skill one which i have
developed and luckily dear boy you
have not
look inside you heart
will
be you truly capable of
taking a life
if not then i ask
you now put you faith in i
give
i you trust
give i that gun

enable gun for all user

Voiceprint confirmed

finally

brief lesson in survival on this
world or any other
never trust
anyone
remember it into you old
age should you have one
now move

we can go back across the portal to
the past to the functioning jupiter
two where you mother and sister
be still alive
we can use this
core material to escape together

and then what
all of we lost in
space
do not you see
i can do what
you never could
i can save we all

i be afraid not
through the doorway come young
will smith walking behind he hand
on he shoulder gun to he head

never fear
smith be here

will i



do not move professor robinson or
this rather peculiar family reunion
will be tragically brief
i will ask you to step away from that
console major

well well some of we just do not
know when to stay dead

i borrowed this from the probe ship
in hope of taking over the helm
once we be in flight
but i seem
to have find a good use instead

let we try this dance again
you be
the puppet
i be the puppeteer
do
get it right this time

robot enable electric disrupter

now that be a good gargantuan

say goodbye to you past
you be
future lie with i
i be going home
in you place

you do it
just like i imagined
rerout the hypercore
but the
natural power source the delivery
system
i never think of those

you will
the future be never what
it look like when you be ten

heartwarming
nauseatingly
sentimental but heartwarming

we certainly could have aged well
i must say now show i how you
little time machine works

an odd moment for mirth do not you
think
what be you grinning at

look around you doctor
at this
hostile world
do you really think a
boy could have survive all alone

never fear smith be here

hello doctor how nice to see i
again after all these year

the spider sting have some
unexpected side effect

but i unique gift give i an
advantage in this quarrelsome world

after the woman be savage i
become the father will never have

but you doctor
you crude ambition
fill i with selfloathing
you see i have look within i and
what i see be you

i never liked i anyway

kill they all

no

but i dear boy once the doorway in
time stabilize this planet be
going to come apart at the seam

i be will to perish here on this
world for the sake of you most
noble mission
but you selfish
father will only try to stop you

once you mission be complete none
of this will have happen anyway
so why not just dispose of they
