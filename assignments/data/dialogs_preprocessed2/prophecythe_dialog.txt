large by add calcium layer over
the interior haversham canal
child
growth be not uniform though come
in spurt that always leave growth
ring in the bone

observer of course have an
explanation

you be missing the point of the game
thomas
you must absolutely trust no
one
form alliance but break they
lure another to trust you then betray
he
you play with too much honor
sink to the gutter
use people
lie
and doublecross they

come on thomas let we take out sam
together

magnificent decadence

the important thing tom be seeing
the game for what it be

sickening hopeless giant suck
hole of depravity

see you guy next tuesday huh

so how be work

okay
now

life on the dark side

can i ask you about something

sure

it have to stay between we
i need
you word on it

as a racquetball player or a priest

i will take the priest for the moment

what be on you mind

it be a case
we find this guy
he
be
different
but he have on he
an old bible

it be a Vichini

worth a little

more than a little
they be the good
sixth century
hand illuminated
Vichini only do twenty each pocket
size for a king to carry into battle
beside he heart
some consider they
the fine bible ever make
i think
they would all be in museum
what be
you do with it

this one a bit special

how

it be have a bonus chapter to st johns
revelation

really
what do it say

reading from slip of
paper
and as in the first war the angel
so fight over the nature of they
god and there be much vanity and
destruction in heaven
for some angel
called they lord the son of god
and other called he the begotten
father of jesus christ
what do you
think

i have never hear that quote before
theologically the first war
obviously refer to the war in heaven
where michael the archangel threw
out satan and he gang
old time
bible stuff
but this imply there
be a second war
that be news to i

and the rest of it

oh it be a fairly common theological
debate
or be
the idea that if
christ be god son do that make
he less than god or be they the
same be in different form
that
very argument almost tear the early
christian church apart in the th
century
that be the good old day
when people actually worried about
theology
anyway it be settled
when the bishop of the world get to
together at the council of nicene in
and hash out the various
interpretation of scripture into a
uniform dogma of belief
the result
be the nicene creed which basically
said that christ be in fact the
same as god and be owe the same
power and respect as the father
that they be the same
but it be not exactly the sort of
thing angel would fight over

why

well they could just ask god right

do you think it be possible that john
might have written that extra chapter

who know
Vichini be the great
biblical scholar of the age some
claimed he make he own translation
from the original writing
maybe he
do find some unknown writing by
john
it be possible i suppose
john
always be a little negative about
angel
all this actually have
something to do with an murder

i do not know yet
maybe
probably
not

i hate to break it you but that
particular family spat have be
settled for year
nobody lose
sleep over it anymore
honest

what do john have against angel

oh he do not trust they much
all
that run around smite and
killing in the name of the lord
god wild bunch
he think it make
they fickle and vain
one click above
ghost
satan do not help the image
much either

satan

well he do start as an angel

so when be you going to get a real
job

you mean with the church

you almost do it once
i never see
a seminary student more called to
the collar than you
why do not you

uh oh
hocus pocus time

people call they in when they think
a witch or a yei be trying to sprinkle
corpse sickness in they hogan or
if the night people have be hanging
around too much
night people screw
around a lot but they be good at
warn of evil ghost

who be the night people

they come as coyote

beautiful star out here

too much fuck sky in the desert
it push on you
sometimes i wonder if anyone in heaven
even know this place be here

where do you keep the coffee in this
joint

above the stove

what happen if the hand trembler
say a ghost have be

mess with mary
if you be smart
you say thank you very much and forget
about it
but if you be heavy
traditional and marys people be
serious traditional you have an
enemy ghost way

what be that

goddamn expensive
it be a sing to
purify and drive off the corpse
sickness
two day of dance and
ceremony and feeding the whole damn
village
not even to mention hire
the yataallii if you can even find
one these day
and you can bet they
do not come cheap
but every clan
do it a bit different
especially
marys

you know they

the bitter sky clan
hard core
reservation
no light no run
water no
they village be out
on the edge of old woman butte
million mile from anything

dead people land where no one else
would right on top of the old Anasazi
village
they be a die clan
just
the old one now
all alone out there
in the middle of nothing
they can keep it

do people really still believe in it
all
ghost sing corpse sickness

depend i guess
sometimes you go
along because it be a village thing
or you do not want to disappoint
grandma
but sometimes when you be
alone out there far from town and
the wind kick up and sneak into
you hogan
i do not know

i think johns out for the evening

saturday night in chimney rock

so how do a person like you end up
teaching here

that no matter how much you muck
around in you life one day if you
listen hard enough a voice would
tell you what you be really cut
out to do
and when it do not show
up on schedule i decided to go look
for it
and i look in a lot of
place believe i
i drive that
road out there so far that the end
become the begin again
and it
be when i get here that i realized
there never be going to be a voice
so i stopped looking and take the
first job they offered i
that make
any sense to you

be you one of they

no

oh i be an angel
very special
one
the first
the old
the naive
eagle scout he once loved i above
all other and i he
it be the
only true love for either of we but
like all true love it could not
possibly last

the winge party boy will come
katherine
they will come to feed on
the guts of you little mary

what do you care

i have i interest

the naive eagle scout he have his
interest too
he even have a place
for they as i do for mine
big
shiny place
you would like it
only
it be be empty for a long time
can not open till after the
resurrection
the problem with the
hire help
always have problem with
the hire help
they be arrogant
boastful little prick
not like i
what i do i do for love
but they
the winge party boy even before
the park could open for it first
customer they start fighting over
the popcorn stand

you see katherine heaven can not
start accepting guest till this
fight be settled
and without people
there be no heaven
all those good
and true soul left moulder in
the ground clutch they Htickets
and waiting and waiting and waiting
some lying down there with the worm
century after century they start to
get doubt about the whole program
that be when out of sheer boredom
some of they come to i
because i be
always open for business
hour a
day seven day a week
even on
christmas

some of the angel cheat
they sneak
a few soul in to help with the fight
the really dark one
and now one of
they have find a special soul so
wonderfully sick that it might just
win it for they
and if one side
win even the wrong one then there be
no fight
and if there be no fight
there can be a heaven

and if there be a heaven

i would be very unhappy
i be here to help you and the little
bitch not because i love you not
because i care about you but because
i want this war to go on and on and
on

i bring you the chance to save you
mary katherine
and along the way
stop the resurrection

how

listen when i speak
now go to bed
katherine
tomorrow i promise you
be a big day

be it over

for now
they start again tomorrow

and at the end of it

the enemy way chant remove the
invading yei ghost

will it work on a general soul

we will see
how be the head

still attached
barely

here i will change the bandage

do that hurt

no

then i must be do it wrong

i see the devil tonight

how nice
which one

the main one
satan
lucifer
the
dark angel
you know

what do he have to say

that he do it all for love
that
and i have a choice
marys life or
a billion soul waiting in the
pipeline for heavenland to open

you be not kidding be you

no sir

satan
you be sure

you have to be there

why be not i

we can double date next time if it be
that important to you

you do not understand i have spent i
whole life
i do not suppose it would occur to
anyone in authority to fill i in on
what be going on every once in awhile
huh
shit

do he say anything about the nicene
council
about the rank of jesus
christ in the holy trinity

it do not seem important to he

be you a priest

near miss

why

it be a long story

this may be you last chance to tell
it

the other night you be talking
about waiting for a voice to call
you to something
well let i tell
you the bad thing that can happen
to you be to be called to something
since i can remember a voice from
somewhere deep in the church called
i
so loud and so often that by
thirteen i know i be going to be a
priest
you know what that be like
i parent friend all of they
think i be crazy
but see i have
this voice
the voice that keep
coaxing i along telling i there
be a reason
so i entered the
seminary and be half way to i
starch white collar when i mother
father and i little brother be
wipe out in a car crash

i have never ask anything of the
voice
not when the neighborhood
kid make fun of i not when i
father look down at i like some
knockkneed faggot
i never question
a damn thing
but on the morning i
spent looking down at three parallel
grave i ask it one question
why
why be these people taken
from i
and the voice that same
voice that would wrench i out of i
sleep some night with it jabbering
it be suddenly stone silent
it be
the only question i ever ask of it
and it just left i hanging in the
fuck wind

so after that i trade in priest
school for homicide school
because
if god would not talk to i the devil
sure as hell would and he way
be a lot easy to understand

we have never see god have we
not
in any of this

yeah he be certainly a shy son of a
bitch i will give he that

maybe we be not suppose to
maybe
that be faith

do you still have faith in anything
katherine

i have faith in mary
and that i be
going to save that little girl from
those creep thing out there
from all of they

maybe you be called to something
after all

maybe we both be


heavy sleeper john

wallet in the dresser

do not be such a materialist john

right
he hated the eagle scout
envy the power he give to he son
but this angel never come out front
during the war

start he own war
it be all just
jealousy
