soap
without screw anyone

i one rule which the agency be not
too happy about be of course
only first no repeat customer



but believe i they do not have
too much trouble honoring that
request




i would make house call to office at

someone niece or cousin in town
on vacation





and then when football season
start saturday through monday

chitchat and he love paying extra
for the stuff we charge extra for




it be open

southern accent

start think

why not
i mean he be not i real
dad
and talk about a first
the
more i think about it



the more turn on i get
then i
think that if i mother could do
some strange guy in i bed i could
do she strange guy in this bed



everything alright in there

still in she southern
accent
just peachy
listen sugar would

little shy

while

keeping i face hidden actually
be not that hard and he pretty
much let i do whatever i wanted




and you know what
he be damn

i would like to see you again
but
uh
i never get you name

ginger

ginger i will not forget




i literally could not feel the
ground under i foot
first to
top all first
i know i would tell he
one day but i wanted to savor it
for a while




ginger
you forget you

jacket



here to immediate gratification

you be great

uh that fall probably will not kill
you and consider what a caring
nurturer you wife be i do not
think that be a risk you can afford
to take



god what a drama queen
do not let
this little act fool you
he would
never let mom get all he money




this be just he twist public
relation brain working overtime to
figure what the appropriate
response should be to fucking you
stepdaughter
ah ha
contemplate
suicide
artin back away from the railing



now that be think outside the
box



we spent the next few hour just
sitting there
i do not think we
said three word
i think he be
trying to find a way to justify the
whole thing but it be actually
one of the sweet night i ever
spent with a guy



he told i it be a monumental
mistake and that we should both
never mention it again
i told he
that be fine



suddenly he start coming home
every night and even start really
asking i about i homework

morning kiddo you finish those
math problem




kiddo

i would be happy to help you with it
if you need

actually i be think about
starting a plan at work could
you help i pick a good mutual
fund





it take exactly one week



in the begin i be concern
this would violate i rule as he
technically be a repeat customer
but then i realized this be i
first affair and with i
stepfather no less
to be perfectly
honest
i loved it
talk about
electric knowing at any moment she
could walk in be good than any
drug
it remind i of when i be
young and bring guy home after
school




at first we be very discreet
only do it when joan crawford
be not home or be completely
comatose



then we get bold do it before
she would pass out
i think we be
seeing exactly how far we could
push the envelope



one night we do it before
entertainment tonight end




we even almost get catch



mini

yeah


god i have tell you a thousand time
to knock

have you see martin
i think he
be in he study a half hour ago

uh
can not say that i have

well i assume he be go out so
i have invited ricardo over for
a
cocktail
you know how child
make he uneasy so i would appreciate
if you and
pointing to martin under
the sheet
you friend could either stay in
here or use the back door when he
arrive

oh
sure no problem

okay she be go



look back that may have be
the moment we fell in love




we become inseparable



mom think it be cute how we have
suddenly grow so close and
think it be wonderful how martin
have taken an interest in i
education



now that we be spending time
together i actually start to
find out what martin be like for
the first time



he be not the drip i think he
be




he be funny charming sweet and
even a little shy



be see in public be no sweat
as long as we do not act like a
couple




this go on for two month before
we have the talk we both know be
coming

so

so

i do not want to have to sneak
around in i own house

well i do not think telling she be
such a hot idea


i mean i do not want to live under
the same roof with she


you can not leave she will get half

can i ask how the hell you married
she without a prenup
she

she be not as bad an actress as you
think

well there be another option

there be

but it will take some planning
and some resolve

wait you do not mean

kill she

no of course not she be i
mother

good


but i have be think if she
suddenly get i will

i will

unstable unpredictable
irrational
dangerous to the
safety of she husband
she
child
she would have to be send
someplace where they could give she
the care she need

it would be for she own good

the only truly caring action we
could take

as painful as it would be for i to
be without i love wife

you do it for the well being of
you daughter
the selfless act of
a devote parent

of course we will have to make sure
she episode be well documented

and corroborate by friend and
people outside the family

public complaint by a neighbor
would not hurt


no that would be useful

and we will find she a very
comfortable place out in the
country

with lots of fresh air

it will be a much good life for
she

much



i awake the next morning as
excite as i could remember
unlike
most first which be over too
quickly this would take
determination



stamina




and imagination




i decided to start simply

year old

diane come on come on


martin
e look up and immediately see the bottle

i picked that prescription up three
day ago
it be probably more than
half full

i suppose we should call an
ambulance

she pulse be almost go

do you really think they can save
she

i
i do not know

she will only try it again
you know
she will

she will if we keep this torture
up

this be wrong call an ambulance


hold on who be we to say she
choice be wrong
she put those
pill in she mouth

mini

do not mini i you have be
bankrol i little project from
day one

we both agreed murder be out

i would hardly call it murder if
anything we be just helping to
fulfill she last wish

she would not have taken the pill
if we have not
mini for god sake she still have
a pulse

so do people in coma
it be just a
matter of time

mini we

look you can drop the indignant
outrage because if you really
care you would have already grab
the phone and dialed by now

can not we just admit how lucky we
be
it be the perfect alibi she
put the drug in she system

what
just leave she here


exactly

i do not know

can you think of one person she
know who would say she be sane at
this point
this be just the
natural sad and inevitable
conclusion to a tragic life
artin ponder the choice

we be this close from be
free
let we just let nature take
it course

and so we passed the time watch
i favorite show


welcome to absolutely positive

the show where we give couple
about to get marry a last chance
to make sure they be

absolutely positive

that be right
we send they out on
one last date with someone other
than they fiance so they can be
sure they be really ready to make
that lifelong commitment




we neighbor mike Rudell the
scumbag at i birthday produce it
and it be so twist i be surprise
i do not think of it



take happy couple about to marry
and try to break they up
the catch
be the couple be always send on
date with people just a little
well looking than they fiances



and we wait some more





typical mom she manage to fuck up
she last act of free will



finally it be time to do the only
humane thing


come on let we go

what

it be time to speed this up

speed this up

we can not wait anymore we alibi be
only believable for maybe another
hour
we can say that after dinner
we go to a movie but if she
have not croak by midnight you can
forget about this

no i be sorry this be going
somewhere i be not prepare to go

oh but you be prepared to sit
here until the pill do she in
i
hate to break it to you but
wherever you be not prepare to
go
the hypocrite express just
rolled into the station

what be you suggest

well i think we would disembowel she
and leave she for the raccoon

kid
god you have lost you
sense of humor
do not worry it will
be painless




to be honest i think we both know
in we heart it would come to
this
and as i first assist
suicide i be going to make it
flawless


come on we do not have time

look if we be going to screw up
the detail we might as well call
san quentin and tell they to fire
up the dutch oven
the gas chamber
martin please i can not explain
everything


i do not think this be a good idea

have you lost you mind mr
public relation
what be the one
thing all she friend be going to
be talking about when they find
out
how do she look
do you think
anyone will think twice if the
answer be fabulous


well if you have get anything to say
to she now would be the time

could you just pretend to have a
little remorse



help we please
i mom i think
she be dead

mommy wake up


it be okay sweetheart everything
going to be okay

mr
tannen i think you should take
you daughter in the house

oh please do not let she die

mr
tannen

yes

i be detective bill garson

yes

i be sorry to be here right now but
whenever there be an apparent
suicide we be required to do an
investigation to rule out homicide

oh
uh
right

it be really just a formality


i mother just killed herself
they
have not even taken she away yet
what be wrong with you


mini please
he be just do his
job

tell he to leave
this be
outrageous

could we do this another time

of course we

thank you

but i do need to ask just a few
simple question before i go

do not you hear he
he said

mini it be okay
just go lie down
for a moment

so after dinner and the movie we
come home at around
and find
she in the garage
i turned off the
car and opened the garage door to
let out the exhaust


what about trying to revive you
wife

of course we do that too but i
could not feel a pulse
mini take a
course at school in and tried
that but
it do not work

so you wife do this sometime
between
and
when you
place the call

yes

may i ask why you left you wife
alone when she have be acting in
such an unstable state

we never think she would do anything
like
this
after the episode in
the mall diane have not left the
house for three day and i
daughter and i just needed a break
it be be a very stressful time

of course
so this be you wife
car

yes

be it in the garage when you left
for dinner or do she drive it in

what

be it in the garage when you left


be be that important


just trying to reconstruct what
happen

oh well
after she be bring
home from the mall the car be
tow here and we put it in the
garage

and no one drive it during those
three day

no mini and i have we own car

we be going to have to impound it
for a few day to take it to the
crime lab

crime lab
oh okay

again purely routine

sure

have you find a note yet

i be sorry

suicide note
the deceased
usually leaf one

oh
right no
not yet
but we
have not really look


mind if i take a look around

no
of course not

who care if we do not leave a
note
just relax

but they said it be

so what
he will do he little dance
and chalk it up to another failed
actress who realized after forty
she might as well be dead

oh shit

what

the sweatsuits and goggle

i already snuck out the back and
threw they in mike Rudells garbage
can

good

Angelpie just relax we do it
we be free




after the funeral i feel it would
be good idea if we take a vacation
and go somewhere where we could
act like a real couple for the
first time
artin tip the on the way out and the moment the



martin agreed and let i pick the
place
i choose las Hadas in
mexico because that be where dudley
moore and bo derek do it in ten



i figure sugar daddyyounger woman
would be old news down there



i could feel that martin have let
the whole thing with the cop go
it have be two week since mom
death and it already feel like it
happen a year ago

you know i have be think that i
might enjoy working in you office
this summer


really
sure if you want

i want



martin mini
be that you



i swear i think martin be going
to wet himself

oh
hi mike what what be you

last week mini mention you two
be coming here for a little
and i suddenly realized i have not
taken a vacation in god know when
jennifer this be i neighbor
martin tannen and he daughter
mini

i be sorry but jennifer have we
meet
you look so familiar

i do not think so




and the ice be that jennifer
work for the same escort service
that i do
now this be rich

i wanted you both to know how sorry
i be for you loss

he just lost six or
seven freeby a year

if there be anything i can do
for either of you



Yikes now that mom out of the
way i guess i be fair game

do not hesitate to ask
remember
i be just right across the fence

thanks mike we appreciate it

why do you tell he

i be just be friendly i have no
idea he would decide to come here

he know
he find the clothes and
goggle and he fucking know

i doubt he even know where he
trash can be

you be overreact
it be just
coincidence

yeah well coincidence or not he
see we together

it be dark i sit up before he see
anything


no he know
it be like he be
toy with we

just relax what be he going to do
go home and tell everyone we be a
couple
we will just laugh it off and
tell everyone he vacation with
hooker

oh come on could that little
moment between you and jennifer
have be any more awkward

i be not jealous or anything i just
think it be funny
talk about six
degree of penetration

you realize he could blackmail we
if the police find out about we
that suicide would not look so
routine

martin please calm down
trust
i nothing be going to happen




the next few day be a laugh
riot



suddenly martin be acting like he
really be i father
channel
mini look very annoy



we return home and thing do not
get much good




what little sex we be have be
get dull



quite frankly with i little
project successfully completed




i be bore
i become concern
that in i world of first i have
achieve i great first



at too young an age

happy birthday mr
president



as for school well i be just in
no state to return to i study
after the trauma of i mother
death



uh oh

yes

minerva tannen detective garson i
do not know if you remember i

Drogues i last name be Drogues
and yes i remember you you be
the big hearted lug who wanted you
question answer while i mother
be still warm

so mr
tannen be you stepfather


nice work McGruff

again i be sorry about that night
but it be policy that we get the
preliminary fact as soon as
possible

what do you want

i need to ask you a few more
question about you mother
death


sure come on in



i know it be stupid as hell to talk
to a cop without a lawyer but i
do not want to look jumpy and i
first real interrogation
i could
feel something tingle deep inside

it be a little early for the prom
be not it

girl can dream can not she

perfectly legal
so anyway we get
the preliminary coroner report
although the pill knock she out
she die of the carbon monoxide
poisoning from the exhaust

be it that important


well it be just a little unusual
for a suicide victim to use two
method
she choice seem i
do not know how to put it
improvisational

well maybe she wanted to drift off
before the fume get she
she
clearly put some thought into that
outfit

clearly
but dying from carbon
monoxide poison be actually
pretty painless you just basically
pass out

i doubt she would have have an
intimate knowledge of how car fume
feel when you choke on they

i suppose you be right
also we
check the phone record and there
be a call place at

it
be a hang up and when the
dispatcher called back a few
minute later there be no answer

really

any idea why she would call



okie fine this may be the most
exciting thing i have do in a
while but even i know when the
rush be not worth the risk

look i think you should come back
when i father around
he will be
upset i let a stranger in the
house


i think you be safe with i


even so he will not be happy

not a problem will he be home
tonight

and you let he in

i play it cool it would have
look bad to be defensive



well when be he coming over

tonight



tonight
i have get a dinner with
chapman
i have already cancel
damn it
why do not you call i

hey i do not know you have plan




listen i will be home early so we
can get the story straight

okay

i really appreciate you taking the
time to help we out
there be just a
few loose end we want to tie up

absolutely
what would you like to
know


there appear to be some question
as to the time of death
you said
you go to dinner and a movie

detective not to be overly
sensitive but do i need i lawyer
here
because these sound like the
question one ask when there be a
homicide investigation

mr
tannen i would really like to just
finish this up i have get real
homicide that need attention
how
about if i just ask you some
question and the one you do not
want to answer we will just skip

that sound good do not it dad
i mean let we just get this over
with


fair enough

terrific
now the preliminary
blood report indicated she have
ritalin in she system

i be not aware i wife be taking
ritalin

neither be she physician he have
never prescribed it

well as you may have discover by
now i wife have substance abuse
problem i be sure there be many
drug she take without a
prescription

i know but it be an odd drug to be
taking
it be mostly given to adult
and child with attention deficit
disorder to calm they
but in
people who do not need it it have
the reverse effect making they
incredibly hyper and agitated

again detective i really can not
say why she be taking these drug

fair enough
mr
tannen be you
and you wife close

no
we lead for the most part
separate live
we have decided to
stay together for mini





oh
sacrifice personal happiness
for the benefit of the child
excellent

i see

listen detective garson i must
admit i do not see the relevance of
these question
diane be an
extremely disturb person
have not
you interview enough people who
see she at she bad

yes but what i be still unclear
about be she time of death

well that make two of we
again detective we be out for
the whole evening

after dinner you see a movie that
night

that be right



start time of the clock

what do you see

that new jackie chan movie where
the terrorist try to blow up mount
rushmore



running time minute

ahh
i buddy told i the end be
crazy




for god sake do he think we
would not actually see it

yeah he slide down washingtons
nose with the bomb strapped to he

dad
do not give it away he have not
see it yet

another demerit

that be okay
where do you see it

the galleria



drive time minute

and you get home at



precisely






with minute of preview
you
do not think we would forget the
preview

now if there be not any more
question it be a school night

no that about wrap it up for now


for now
detective we be trying
very hard to put we live back
together but every time you come
by it just dredge everything back
up
we have tell you everything we
know


i wish i could be more definitive

well i be telling you the next time
you have a question it have good
be because you be charging we

i be just asking you to please let
we deal with we grief and get on

death penalty

he be probably just trying to spook

you unless they think you do it

it be a great plan no one can
prove we stick those sleep pill
in she mouth because we do not

martin do not sleep at all that
night and make damn well sure i
do not either



with mommy dear out of the way
i decided to take the matter of
Rudell into i own hand
i know
martin would not approve but at
this point
action have to be
taken




i would catch he off guard
disorient he and then kill he



with kindness

hi mr
Rudell i be sorry to bother
you

not at all as i said down in
mexico
anything for a neighbor

may i come in


wow i have not be here since you
redecorate

it be just finished
i be sorry
you mother never get to see it
completed

i know she would approve

if you do not mind i asking
how
be you do

it be be hard but i guess i have
just be telling myself that she be
probably much happy where she be
now

you be absolutely


positive

well that too but correct be
the word i be think of
do you
like the show

oh god it be i favorite
i love
how you never know if the couple
will decide to stay together

i could arrange for you to go to
the set one day if you would like or
even be a contestant

contestant
really

sure those date be really quite
harmless
you just spend an evening
with the person
we prep you on
what to say before the show

it sound like fun

anyway what be on you mind

well um
this may sound strange
but you have not see any suspicious
looking people around we house
lately

no be everything okay

yes it be just that since momes
death someone send we a photo of
martin and i together


together

it indicated that we be
i know
this sound crazy but
a couple

couple
you and martin
hmmm
i
mean certainly old man and
young woman be an
accept part of society but
for someone to do that well
it be
just tasteless

exactly so we be just trying to
figure who Rit could be

hmm i have not notice anyone at
all
out of curiosity what kind
of a picture could they send you to
indicate that you and martin be
together

oh it be not like we be naked or
anything
i mean of course he be
see i naked he be i step
father

of course



much to i surprise i be invited
to stay for a refreshing
beverage




i know he have have no shortage of
young woman in he bed but he have
be paying for it in one form or
another for a long time



and the one undeniable fact i have
learned from martin be that there
be no great thrill or triumph in
a mane life



than get a ripe young woman
to open the gate to heaven for no
other reason than she wanted to



frankly i be surprise the
anticipation of pulling off a
motherdaughter double dip do not
give he a stroke right there



who can take tomorrow
dip it in a
dream separate the sorrow and
collect up all the cream the candy
man oh the candy man can




i left that day exhilarated in the
knowledge that in one afternoon i
have turn Rudell into a trout on a
line
and he would follow i anywhere
i tug the pole

the candy man can because he mix
it with love and make the world
taste good




the photo stopped coming and
although martin be freak out
about he business thing be
returning to normal
i even decided
to return to school

mini i have get a message for you to
go to the principal office right
away



then thing get interesting again


detective garson be everything all
right
black and white surveillance tape of one of the school



mini this tape be shoot a week
before you mother death



the next day the school nurse
report two bottle of Ritalin
missing from the medicine cabinet

we have lift two print from the
door and the inside of the medicine
cabinet
they do not match the
nurse

mini be there something you would like
to say to detective garson

can we see the tape of the der
fuhrer sucking down she afternoon
fix of smirnoff or do not you have
camera in the bathroom stall


young lady stealing anything
especially prescription drug be a
serious matter

you get i okay
but what be i
suppose to do

what do you mean

she
she said if i do not she
be
be going to

who
another student

i mother
she make i steal they
for she
i do not want to but she
said she be going to send i to
board school in canada if i
do not


canada

the yukon territory
be you
happy now
you get i

oh i lord i have know idea she
be

an addict
detective garson know
we told he and now what
the
whole school going to know

she be dead i mommies dead
can not
we just leave she be


detective garson i assume there
will not be a need to press charge
against ms
Drogues

you going to cuff i copper

she be free to go

ah mr
tannen we be just coming
up to see you
have you get a
minute

detective i told you no more
question without i lawyer

i think you would well call he

there be a small discrepancy that i
can not quite figure out and i be
hope you might be able to explain
it

i suppose i can try


the final toxicology report come
back and you wife definitely
do not die from the pill
she
be not conscious past
but it
be the fume that killed she


well hallelujah thank for the
update

martin easy

i be sorry but this be harassment

see here what i needed to ask
you
the gas tank in the jag be
almost full just a gallon have be
used

and

well if she be unconscious by

that mean the car must have
be running for at least two hour
when you find she
an unconscious
person can not turn on a car right

detective with all due respect
could you get to the point

well here where i get confuse
see that particular model idle
for two hour will burn at least
four gallon of gas

so there be really no way the tank
could be almost full if it be
running for two hour
be there


so i guess what i be asking be
whose idea be it to put she in the
car

martin do not say anything

now mr
tannen you clearly have
the most to gain from she death
but i have learned from a number of
you wife friend that she and
mini have a strain relationship

again detective i client will not
be answering anything so let we
just cut the cat and mouse

i would like mr
tannen to know that if
he be trying to be a protective
father by covering up something
mini do i would be careful
the
district attorney be viewing this
case as an opportunity to show the
public that the rich do not get away
with murder in this town


do this mean he be offering mr
tannen immunity if he say he be
protecting he daughter

it be a strong possibility
but he
want mr
tannen to know he will go
for the maximum sentence if he
do not
no manslaughter no plea
bargain nothing


it be colonel mustard in the
library with the candlestick

uh
miss Drogues as you lawyer

do not wet you pants i know when
to shut up and swallow

i tongue

look the fact that the marriage
be unhappy and there be no pre
nup give all the motive to martin

so you want i to say it be his
idea

if it be he idea give i one
reason you should take the fall



at that moment i know we have he
if he be trying to get i to rat
on martin he do not have enough to
charge either one of we


so if i tell the jury it be his
idea and i be scare for i life
because he said he would kill i if i
ever tell anyone then i walk


sorry sport but i will take i
chance

i never doubt for a minute you
be going to hold firm
not a
second
i hope you know that

oh i know
i know

good
you realize we have get to
rely on each other

who else do we have

exactly
we be almost home free
i
lawyer say that gas gauge theory
be circumstantial as hell
i have
only get one concern now

what

Rudell
if a jury know we be a
couple we have both get a motive and
that change everything


baby do not worry about he he be
just jealous because you have still
get rockin abs and a good
hairline

even if he do send that picture
what do it prove
nothing



for all of martins talk of rely
on each other



garson have succeed in plant
the seed of distrust



we relationship have turn into
what some might call



unhealthy




something have to give and
ironically enough it be the night

needless to say i appearance on
absolutely positive be the most
sought after clip in every newsroom
in town



the trial be quick
once mom
affair with Rudell come out the


realized he have a motive and a
slam dunk
an elderly hispanic woman cast a harsh eye

guilty




since Rudell be in a coma the
issue of i relationship with
martin be moot
martin realized
trying to pin anything on i would
probably get he the chair



at he sentencing i beg for
leniency
he get off with ten for
the attempt murder of Rudell and
twenty to life for momes death



the outpour of support be
amazing



martins asset be put in a trust
for i and since i be eighteen i
be allow to live by myself


i be sorry i forget to bring that
book you wanted

it be okay Myou can mail it

be you okay
you look like you
have not shower in day

well
uh
you have to be careful
about sh
so how be school

you will never guess what happen

what

i be vote valedictorian

but do not you have to be

the good student
i know
but the
student take a vote and they said
they wanted i to have it for
demonstrate remarkable courage in
the face of unspeakable loss

i wonder how the real valedictorian
feel

like slit he wrist with the
sharp end of a protractor


be Rudell out of he coma yet

i do not know why

why
mini if he recover he may try to
blackmail you with those picture

oh
i would not worry about that

but if the

get those picture
you could

i be pretty sure he will not be do
anything with they

mini you be not think of
sleeping with he to keep he
quiet
because i have meet people in
here who could help we with he if
it come to that

help we

they know people on the outside we
could
pay to make sure he do not
try to take advantage of you

oh gosh that be so romantic
it be
like you be a real life criminal
with connection and everything
but i be a little surprise you
have not figure it out yet

what


oh
wow like i think you be
just playing along because i be you
only link to the outside world but
you really do not know


Rudell do not send those picture

you remember aurelio

we cabana boy from mexico

what a sweetie i think i might
have to fuck he but just giving
he the camera be enough

you
you

it be pretty clear garson be not
going to give up and sooner or later
he would find enough to charge we
it
just seem ridiculous that we would
both end up suffering

oh come on you would have do it
if you think of it first
you
know i be right


hey listen since conjugal visit
be pretty much out of the
question i think it would be
cool if we tried a little prison
phone sex

they do not tap these line do
they
i think i might even be able to
open i blouse without anyone
seeing
you ready

guard

no
be you sure
i will not be able
to come back for a few week
wait have you meet someone in
here

guard

why you old dog
i know you
would not be single in here for
long

guard
she do it
she just
admit it
it be she idea

i guess this mean i could start
dating around too

do not let she leave
she be guilty
get the warden


okay that be enough


you bitch
you little whore

daddy why be you saying those
thing

i be going to kill you
do you hear i
you little bitch

daddy stop
i love you
do not say
that
i love you



as many of you know the past
few month of i life have be
very difficult
i do not know how i
would have get through it
without all of you
i really think
it be a testament to the love in
this institution that i stand
before you today as the first
straight student in school
history vote Valedictorian


again to marvin Tepperman the
real valedictorian he deserved
this and i want to wish he a
speedy recovery
i speak to his
doctor today and they say with
medication and therapy marvin
should be able to attend harvard
this fall

while i may not have excel in
the classroom i think i recent
experience in that big
schoolhouse we call life have
taught i a few lesson that i would
like to share with i fellow
graduate

follow you heart and do not
question it now matter where it
tell you to go
trust i it will
open up a world of new experience
you can not even imagine

but as you listen to it do not
forget you family you parent
do not forget they be people too
and while we may not always agree
with they remember to love they
when they need love

and i mean really love they do not
just pay they lip service
really
do it
whenever you can

i know i do and i just wish i
dad could be here today so after
this speech i could just walk down
into the audience and give he i
love right here
in front of all
of you
thank you and good luck



like i promised no prom night
highjinks no nerd becoming
popular no shakespeare shove up
you ass



and in case you be feeling guilty
about have no one to identify
with but i relax



there be a first time for
everything
