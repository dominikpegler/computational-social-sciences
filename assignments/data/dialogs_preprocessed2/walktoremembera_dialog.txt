but nobody pressing charge

i will get something for we to
drink

do not bother


you know we planet would not
suffer for one nanosecond if
human die off
but if ant
disappeared that would be
catastrophic

apropos of nothing
so
so so
so so


let we get something straight
you
do not know i
i do not know you
but i know what you be about
keep you distance from this
house and from jamie

i miss anything


the carter boy
tell i about
he

he want help with he line


he be driving the car that hit
harold keene

by accident


jamie he be careless
reckless
be this really the good time to be
making a new friend


i be suppose to always be alone


i do not want you to see he
outside school activity

fine
but i need to start
deciding how to spend i time and
i life


i be sorry you mother be not here
to help you become a woman

dad i have become a woman without
she
just not a pretty one

re
she father
i know
do not say anything

he be a softy
get he wrapped
around i finger

you think so

know so


this way

people think i be strange do not
they

yes

because i try to be nice to
people

yeah
maybe
i dunno

do you think i be strange

yeah
but that can be good

why be we here

cuz it be dark and quiet and you
can see into another world

the world of the dead


could be

i mother buried near here

i father alive but it be like
he be dead

what be that

that be i telescope

saturn
beautiful

before voyager we expect maybe a
dozen ring

but there be thousands of they
make of float ice


maybe debris from a moon that
broke apart

or build block for a world
that never form

i be not smart
just a sponge

sometimes i come here and just
scan the heaven

look for intelligent life

look for something someone

do you believe you will see you
mother again

i hope so
i think maybe she see i now

re
telescope
i be building a large one to see
the nucleus of Haleys comet

the dirty snowball at it core

yeah
i be probably not going to be
around next time it come


in year i neither

you be really into god right

in ten word or less

yeah

i relationship with god be i
own

but you think about he it
she

do not you

not really

when you do how do you

like in a church paint
i see
this giant hovering over the
ground
he be wearing a robe and
have long flow hair and he be
pointing he finger at something

do you ever wonder why thing
happen the way they do

no


i know there be a plan for
everyone but sometimes i do not
understand what the message be
or what the point be

there be no point
you live
you
die
the end

maybe we be not suppose to
understand but we be suppose to
have faith that someone else see
the big picture

you have to believe to have faith

you do not believe in anything

the bible
why should i read a
bunch of dumb story about some
ancient guy who supposedly worked
miracle

interpret by another guy like i
father

you father do not like i

he do not trust you

sometimes i do not even trust i

i be not afraid of you

likewise


woman be definitely evolve into
man

the moustach on some girl
unbelievable

why be jamie sullivan stare at
we

she want to jump Landons bone

that be so pitiful

she be very confuse

delude

derange


demented

she be coming over here

heart be still

hi

good

i be really glad you think so

i guess you do not want to practice
line tonight

you guess right

that be one girl who can not take a
hint

because she do not know what a
hint be

together

oh
just not at school

yeah

or anywhere where people might see
we

Belindas a very jealous person

that would be the reason

so it be like you want to be secret
friend

that be it
exactly
you be
reading i mind

then maybe you can read mine

i think i see something in you
something good
but i be wrong

the first time i meet he i know
i be proud of how you be handling
yourself

the three corner of a triangle
take one step in

be i at the same angle to you and
the basket as before

length

scalene

okay
make i an isoscele

yes
two side the same


as

because if we do she will think
we be trying to get rid of she


as

the father
she will sure think the same if i
do it
you be she father and
come a time when a father get to
mention



morning pop

i dream
we have a rain rain coming down in
sheet
lightning flash
thunder rolled up and down the

from i

like you walk away from we

she be like some puritan

she be not
she be get she own
idea

mutant idea


maybe to you

Belindas telling everyone that
kiss be real

it be

and that you be scamming on jamie
sullivan

Scammings a strong word

you be not in school yesterday

you be hardly nice to anyone

i be sorry

i wish i could believe you

landon

later

about be someone friend

i do not want to be just you
friend

you do not know what you want

you do not either
take a look at
