above average for these water
do you go out in a boat and look
around

it be not an accident it be not a
boat propeller or a coral reef or
jack the ripper

this be the
large mean most vicious shark
ever landed off amity island and a
known maneater

let we just cut he open and see what be
inside

why not larry

there be a shark just off the island
somewhere

how come you have to tell they that

excuse i but what be you talking
about
do not they catch the shark
this afternoon
it be on the cape
station news

they caught a shark not the shark
big difference
i could have prove it
this afternoon by cutting that one
open and examining he stomach
content
also he bite be too
small

i be lucky to find that in town
it be an estate bottle vintage year

we ought to let it breathe
whatever

let we all have a drink

you too sweetheart

thank you

here to you husband the only
other rational man on the island

you be leaving

go out on the aurora


be that a boat

be it
the bestfunded research
expedition to ever study the shark
around the world in month

like those cousteau special on
television
i think it be for the
kid but i love they

well than cousteau or Compagno
with computer telemetry defense
department fund

a clinical word for it

drown
lemme ask you something
be it true most attack take place
in three foot of water around
foot from the beach

yeah
like the kid on you beach
i wish i could have examine that shark
they caught

something else
do most attack go
unreported

about half of they
lot of amissing
swimmer be really shark victim

there be a kind of a lone shark
called uh

rogue

yeah
rogue
pick out an area where
there be food and hang out there as
long as the food supply last

it be called territoriality
it be a
theory

and before when people first
starting swim for recreation
before public bthe and resort
there be very few shark attack
because shark do not know what they
be missing

you could say that

why do not we have one more drink
you and i and then we go down and
cut open that old shark and see for
sure what be inside he or not

can you do that

i be chief of police
i can do
anything i want
you want to come

i be flatter you should ask

and it be dartmouth winter

and i be she date
then she get
into the fact that she family have
more money than i family and she
be right she greatgrandfather
be in mining and i ancestor be

so we broke up
and i go home with some beatnik
from sarah lawrence

what stink so bad

tooth buried in the hull
he must have
attack
i know it
gardners
dead in there
i do not see the
mate

no shark do that to a boat

jesus christ
great white
Whod
believe it
we be not talking about
a shark we be talking about a shark

there be a kind of shark called a
great white shark that every expert
in the world agree be a maneater

you be situation here suggest that
a great white have stake out a claim
in the water around amity island
and that he will continue to feed
here as long as there be food in the
water

there be no limit to where he can
strike and we have have three attack
and two death in the past few day
it happen like this before in
when a great white killed five
swimmer at jones beach in long
island

shark attack be stimulated by
the kind of splashing and activity
that occur whenever human go
swim you can not avoid it

th of july beach be like ringing
a dinner bell for chrissake

i just pulled a shark tooth the size
of a shot glass out of the hull of a
wrecked boat out there

we tow ben gardners boat in larry
he be dead and he boat be all
chewed up

be that tooth here
do anyone see
it

i do not have it

he lost it on the way up

what kind of a shark do you say it
be

Carcaradon carcharias
great white

well i be not going to commit economic
suicide on that flimsy evidence
we
depend on the summer people for we
live and if we beach be closed
then we be all finished

we have get to close the beach
we
have get to get someone to kill the
shark we need noncorrosive mesh
net we need scientific support
it be going to cost money just to keep
the nut out and save what we have

i do not thing either of you be
familiar with we problem

i be familiar with the fact that you
be going to ignore this thing until
it swim up and bite you on the
ass
there be only two way to solve
this thing
you can kill it or you
can cut off it food supply

that mean closing the beach

come here i want to show you
something

sick vandalism
brody that be a
deliberate mutilation of a public
service message
i want those little
painthappy bastard catch and hung
up by they baby buster browns

indianapolis
june th three and a half
minute past midnight two torpedoe
from a japanese submarine slam
into we side
two or three
we be
still under seal order after
deliverin the bomb
the hiroshima
bomb
we be going back across the
pacific from Tinian to leyte
damn
near eleven hundred man go over
the side
the life boat be lash
down so tight to make the bomb run
we could not cut a single one adrift
not one
and there be no raft
none
that vessel sink in twelve
minute
yes that be all she take
we do not see the first shark till
we would be in the water about an hour
thirteenfooter near enough

blue
you measure that by judgin
the dorsal to the tail
what we do not
know
of course the captain know
i
guess some officer know
be the
bomb mission have be so secret no
distress signal be send
what the
man do not know be that they would not
even list we as overdue for a week
well i do not know that i be not
an officer just as well perhaps
so some of we be dead already
in the water just hangin limp in
we lifejacket
and several already
bleedin
and the three hundred or
so laying on the bottom of the ocean
as the light go the shark come
crusin
we form tight group
somewhat like square in an old battle
you know what i mean so that when
one come close the man nearest would
yell and shout and pound the water
and sometimes it worked and the fish
turned away but other time that
shark would seem to look right at a
man right into he eye and in
spite of all shoutin and poundin
you would hear that terrible high
screamin and the ocean would go
red then churn up as they ripped
he
then we would reform we little
square
by the first dawn the shark
have taken more than a hundred
hard
for i to count but more than a
hundred
i do not know how many shark
maybe a thousand
