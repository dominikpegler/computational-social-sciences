just keep looking forward

but be it a bad decision
at the
time i think she money would save
the movie

eddie you screw up

yeah i do


in life the decision that haunt you
be the one where you just do not
know
where right or wrong will
never be answer
year ago the hungarian contact
i
the government wanted i to come
home to be minister of culture

really

it be a very impressive offer
fancy office a big home
i would be
treated like a king

so why do not you do it

i do not know if it be a trick
they might arrest i and throw i in
a gulag
i be Hungarys most famous emigrant
they would use i as a lesson to anyone
who try to leave

but maybe not

correct
so instead i stay here
waiting for i comeback
always
hope
the next film the next
film
that would be the one

you next film
that
will
be the
one


and then dr
Vornoff fall in the
pit and he own octopus attack and
eat he
the end

religious film on the apostle
but unfortunately we do not have
enough money

raising money be tough

oh
we church have the money for one
film
we just do not have it for all
twelve

okay you know what you do
you
produce a film in a commercially
proven genre
and after it be a hit
you take the profit from
that
and
make the twelve apostle movie

would that work

absolutely
you see this script

Graverobbers from outer space
it be
money in the bank

Graverobbers from
what

from outer space
it be science
fiction
very
big with the kid
if you make this picture you will have
enough money to finance a
religious film
and
pay i back rent from the
profit

i do not know
this be all a lot to
absorb

it be a guarantee blockbuster

um i understand that this science
friction be popular but do not the
big hit always have big star

yeah well we have a big star
bela lugosi

lugosi
do not be pass on

yes but i have get the last footage
he ever shoot

just it do not look like very much

it be plenty
it be the acorn that
will grow a great oak
i will just
find a double to finish he scene
and we will release it as bela
Lugosis final film


bunny

yeah i get the baptist church of
beverly hills to put up the cash

ed i get the lugosi lookalike

paul you get to try hard
i do not
want this film to be haifassed
this time we go for the quality

and by the way keep sunday free
the producer want all of we to get
baptized


you know when you rewrite a script
it just get good and good

do you want you button on the left
or the right

the left
it be more natural
hey i have get a scene where the
alien have the ultimate bomb
what
would that be make of

uh atomic energy

you should feel lucky
ed the only
guy in town who do not pass judgment
on people

hell if i do i would not have any
friend

look

the ghoul wife a little less
prominent so people will not really
notice i in the movie

before we start shooting mr
wood
we have a few question

the script refer on numerous
occasion to graverobbing
now we
find the concept of digging up
consecrate ground highly offensive
it be blasphemy

what be you talking about
it be
the premise of the movie
it be even
the title for christs sake

mr
wood

yes about that title it strike we
as very inflammatory
why do not we
change it to
plan nine
from
outer space

that be ridiculous


and

Medicul eksaminer be aroundt yet

about the art of film
production

that cardboard headstone tip over
this graveyard be obviously phony

people will not notice
filmmake
be not about picky detail it be
about the big picture

oh you want to talk about the big
picture
