an hour and twentyseven minute and
fiftytwo second

in an article

one of they a pulitzer
picture this if you will
small
town in maryland a sleepy little
village within that a hardware store

so what be in store for we in tomorrow
column

i do not know yet
i be kind of a last
minute man
idea do not flow until an
hour or two before deadline

this be very interesting
you get you
idea for you column from life
you
start up a conversation with a woman in
a bar attack she choice of read
material try and get a rise out of she
while you contemplate whether or not
she be worth hitting on

no i can not hit on you until i get an
idea

that be flatter

no you do not understand

i think i do understand
so i not
respond to you baiting i will
inspire one of those potential bitter
diatribe you love to write about woman
and all the thing we do to drive man
crazy

i do not write bitter diatribe about
woman
very often

only when the idea be not flowing
huh
well it be very nice to meet
you oneminute man

that be last minute man
and it be the quality that count

you know for a good look man you
strike out a lot

i have see much bad

i said i have see much bad

excuse i

the brushoff

i have witness far more treacherous and
nefarious exit than that
at least
she castigate you in private

not as private as i think

kevin you have get some napkin

write or wipe

give i a pen

ah come on
they deserve it
they
love you they hate you they be hot
they be cold they be high they be
low

they be up they be down
it be
really fun making this list with you
but i have get a column to go write

ike

but you do not have a really superb idea
well there be a girl from i hometown
you could write about

excuse i we do not need any new idea

she like to dump groom right at the
altar
they call she the runaway
bride

she perform the travesty seven or
eight time
right at the altar she
turn around and run like hell
bolt

adios
plow down the aisle knock
old lady out of she way like the
run of the bull at pamplona
and
guess what

i give up

she have the next victim all lined up
she be twirling another body on the
spit

imagine if you will a small town in
maryland


today be a day of profound
introspection i have be accused
of use this column to direct bitter
diatribe at the opposite sex
this
uncomfortable accusation have plunge i
into at least fifteen minute of
serious reflection from which i have
emerge with the conclusion that yes
i traffic in female stereotype


but how can one blame i when every
time i step out i front door i meet
fresh proof that the female archetype
be alive and well
te mother the
virgin the whore the crone
they be
elbow you in the subway stealing
you cab and overwhelming you with
perfume in elevator


but perhaps in fairness to the fair
sex i do need to broaden i horizon
and add some new goddess to the
pantheon
i would like to nominate for
deity



the cheerleader the coed and the
maneater the last of which concern i
most today



to be fair the maneater be not
exactly new
in ancient greece this
fearsome female be known as Erinys
the devouring death goddess
in india
she be kali who like to devour she
boyfriend shivas entrails while she
yoni devour he dot dot dot never
mind
in indonesia the bloodyjawed
maneater be called Ragma


you notice these be all country
without cable
then continue
read

and in hale maryland where she
help run the family hardware store
she be known as miss maggie carpenter


the runaway bride




and in hale maryland where she
help run the family hardware store

we have to go to maggie
cindy mind
the shop
exit salon
continue read

she be known as miss maggie
carpenter the runaway bride



holy moly

what be unusual about miss carpenter
be that she like to dress she man up
as groom before she devour they
she
have already disemboweled six in a row
by leaving they at the altar

i
can not ready anymore


take paper from
she read
and she ritual feast continue as she
prepare to make a sacrifice out of the
seventh fiance
so all bet be on and
we hope that this boomerang bride be not
honeymoon with las vegas odds maker
because many predict that this girl be
out of there before the race
before
the rice hit the ground
holy moly


you tell maggie

no you tell she


no no
you be she good friend

no


holding she
newspaper
you know it be just possible that she
have not read this yet

yeah


maybe she have not read the paper


or not

here we go
one antique hot water
handle with the still on it
guaranteed to fit any american standard
cast iron tub with a fourinch center
make between and
in other
word i think you be out of the
doghouse with mrs
paxton


hallelujah

alright mr
paxton i will put it on
you account

maggie

you do not need an air conditioner earl
you just need an attic fan there be
more in the back

what

so mag you have see this huh

yes i have see it
and i have to say
it be the rude and most offensive
joke anybodies ever play on i

you guy
how long do this take you

where do you get this do
you creep
i should disinvite you
and why do you say seven time
this
be four

uh maggie you told we to bachelorette
joke so we do not


holy moly

um you know now would be a good
moment to tell i this be fake
it will not be funny if you drag it out
okay
okay well
i mean i can find out
real newspaper smear
phoney paper
do not

bag


bag




dear editor



cont
greeting from the stick
perhaps you
believe that a rural education be
focused mainly on hog calling and
tractor maintenance rather than reading
why else would you print a piece of
fiction about i and call it fact



cont
i suppose mr
graham be too busy
think we slanderous statement about
how i dump man for kick to bother with
something silly like accuracy in
report
which be understandable
because with a maneater like i on
the loose who have time to check fact



cont
still we cannibalistic queen can get
pretty cranky when we see thing in
print that hurt we feeling like that
we deliberately abandon fiances with
malice aforethought



cont
that be why i be surprise to find mr
grahams editor be a woman
call i a
sentimental fool but i sort of hope
we maneater could stick together


i will put in a good word for you

no no do not mention i name in there

why

you can go in now


anyway i be just dropping you big city

anything male that move

on anything male that move
as
opposed to anything male that do not
move

like certain kind of coral

get it all wrong

not very flatter to i either
so
i be going to give you a chance to write
the truth

i have decided to cooperate and let you
interview i
for a thousand buck

i want a big wedding and a killer dress
and for a grand i will answer all you
question and let you follow i around

i magazine do not pay because for

you probably get severance or
expense or both
i will take you check
no credit card

you have see the postits
i have already
get more juicy material than i need
why should i pay you dollar one

because i think you be writing on spec
and with a first person interview you
might actually sell that thing

too much

Sevenfifty

five hundred

Sixfifty

do


pardon the mess
i have not cleaned
since the fifth grade

what be this over here

it be a birthday present for i cousin
put you finger in

cindy the manicurist

no the other one

this be wonderful
you reconfigure all
these industrial part and you do
something amazing with it

amaze
find industrial stuff
willow lamp
rasta lamp

be this you prefer logo

i think so

this whole thing be pretty
incredible
i think you could probably sell this
lamp idea in new york

maybe someday

you afraid to try

no i be not afraid
just
maybe
someday

well i be impress
absolutely
incredible
i do not expect pink and lacy but this
be not exactly a woman room

what an incredible chauvinistic
observation

that be brians
he take i ut canoeing
on the lake and give i the ring in a
velvet box

it be classic

gill
of course
he proposed at the
tiedye tshirt stand at a dead concert
it be very sweet until he hallucinate
that the drum set be a bloodsuck
space alien

always a mood killer

still sweet

george
he proposed at a butterfly
farm in st
thomas
the ring be
inside a cocoon

it be a little silence of the lamb
for i
i can not believe you wait for
the wedding to run

he be an entomologist
i think it be
very unique

and here we be at bob
he proposed
during the seventh inning stretch

at an orioles game

wait
do not tell i
the scoreboard
light up with mary i maggie


it be one of the most wonderful
moment of i life
cal Ripken even
applaud

highly suspect

what do you mean
it be incredibly
romantic

maybe it be just i but if you get
to dress it up it do not ring true

i think the most anybody can honestly
say be look

sit on the arm
of the couch
i guarantee that we will have tough
time
i guarantee that at some point
one or both of we will want to get out
of this thing
but i also guarantee
that if i do not ask you to be mine
i will regret it for the rest of i life
because i know in i heart you be
the only one for i

i like it

i would like it good on a scoreboard
be that how you proposed when you ask
you wife to marry you

do not look so surprise you have get
divorce written all over you

i be a work in progress

be that what you said to she

no

like so uh maybe we should ya
know
what do you think


now that be romantic
proposal like
that and you do not find eternal bliss
what go wrong

i do not know

no

maybe you should ask she some time
ever thought of that

call i crazy but i believe that check
i give you entitle i to ask the
question for a while

fair enough
actually

i will just need one more day to make sure
