you do not work with i if i work with
you without knowing who i be working for
now let we cut the shit

strange look cross Keatons face
skepticism mockery and
just a hint of fear
hockney mcmanus and Fenster all share
similar look

what be this

who be keyser Soze

i be sure you have hear a number of tall
tale myth and legend about mr
Soze
i can assure you gentleman most of they
be true

who be keyser Soze

judge by the sudden change in mood i
be sure the rest of you associate can
tell you mr
Kint
i have come with an
offer directly from mr
Soze
an order
actually

an order



in nineteeneighty one mr
keaton you
participate in the hijack of a truck
in buffalo new york
the cargo be raw
steel
steel that belong to mr
Soze
and be destine for pakistan to be used
in a nuclear reactor
very profitable
violation of you

regulation
you have no
way of knowing this because the man
shipping the steel be working for mr
sate without he knowledge

mr
Fenster and mr
mcmanus hijack a
twinprop cargo flight early this year
out of newark airport
the plane be
carrying platinum and gold wiring
also
set for pakistan
kobayashi turn and point at hockney

two month ago mr
hockney steal a truck
carrying gun part through queens
everyone look at hockney
he smile shyly
it occur to they
all that he robbed the truck for which they be all arrested
in the first place

gun allegedly set to be destroyed by
the state of new york
they be to be
lost in a weigh station and rout to
belfast
again mr
sate use pawn who
have no knowledge
which bring we to mr
Kint
verbal crumble under he stare

nine month ago one of mr
Soze less
than intelligent courier be taken in a
complicate confidence seam by a cripple
he be relieve of sixtytwo thousand
dollar
now
it have taken we some time to find you
we intention be to approach you after
you apprehension in new york



you set up the lineup

mr
Soze make a few call yes
you be
not to be released until i come to see
you
it seem mr
Keatons attorney ms
Finneran be a bit too effective in
expedit he release
holding the rest
of you become a moot point

what about Redfoot

mr
Redfoot know nothing
mr
Soze rarely t
work with the same people for very long
and they never know who they be working
for
one cannot be betrayed if one have no
people

so why tell we

because you have stolen from mr
Soze
that you do not know you steal from he
be the only reason you be still alive
but he feel you owe he
you will repay
you debt

who be this guy
how do we know you work
for Soze

i do not think that be relevant mr
hockney
the five of you be responsible
for the murder of saul berg and he
bodyguard
mr
Redfoot can attest to
you involvement and we can see to it
that he will
he be not of you
superior breed

this be a load of shit

the offer be this gentleman
mr
Sozes
primary interest as i be sure you all
know be narcotic
he be be compete
shall we say with a group of



argentinian for several year
competing
with mr
Soze have taken it toll
these
argentinian be negotiating the sale of
ninetyone million dollar in cocaine in
three day time
needless to say this
purchase will revitalize the diminishing
strength of they organization
mr
Soze
want you to stop the deal
if you
choose you may wait until the buy
whatever money change hand be yours
the transaction will take place on a boat
in san pedro
mr
Soze want you to get
to the boat and destroy the cocaine on
board
then you be free of you
obligation to mr
Soze

give i one good reason why i should not
kill you right now
kobayashi smile and put he briefcase on the table in front
of he

gift from mr
Soze gentleman
he turn and walk out of the room
keaton walk over to the case and open it
he reach in and
pull out five thick manila envelope each marked in bold
black letter
mcmanus and

keaton pull out the file revealing a map underneath
keaton hand each man he file

he pull
out a thick stack of paper and thumb through they

jesus christ
open they
all of the man open they file
inside be mug shot of each

criminal record
but there be more

they know everything
mcmanus

keaton pull out a large black and white photograph of
himself and he lawyer
they be laughing arm
in arm by a fountain in new york

this be not right

i do not know
who be that guy that used
to talk about Soze in new york
mcmanus
brick marlin

yeah
he said he do job for he
indirect stuff
always five time more
money than the job be worth

come on
the guy be a pipe dream
this
kobayashi be use he for window
dressing

i do not know
this be bad

it be bullshit
this guy could be



i think it be a setup

the way i hear it Soze be some kind of
butcher
no pity

there be no keyser Soze
verbal thumb through he file
long list of name
number address
it be a detail portfolio of he entire
criminal and personal life
he look up at keaton



who be keyser Soze



he be suppose to be turkish
some say r
he father be german
nobody believe he
be real
nobody ever see he or know
anybody that ever worked directly for
he but to hear kobayashi tell it
anybody could have work for Soze
you
never know
that be he power
the
great trick the devil ever pulled be
convincing the world he do not exist
one
story the guy told i the story i
believe be from he day in turkey
there be a petty gang of hungarian that
wanted they own mob
they realized that
to be in power you do not need gun or
money or even number
you just needed
the will to do what the other guy
would not
after a while they come to
power and then they come after Soze he
be small time then just running dope
they say








they come to he home in the afternoon
looking for he business
they find his
wife and kid in the house and decide to
wait for sate





he come home to he wife raped and he
child screaming
the hungarian know
Soze be tough
not to be trifle with
so they let he know they mean business



they tell Soze they want he territory
all he business
Soze look over the
face of he family
then he show
these man of will what will really be





he tell he he would rather see his
family dead than live another day after
this
walk over to he wife cry and beaten on the floor
and hold up she head
she give he the strange look
one
of trust perhaps saturated with fear and humiliation
he put the gun between she eye and fire



he let we the last hungarian go and he
go running
he wait until he wife and
kid be in the ground and he go after
the rest of the mob
he kill they kid
he kill they wife he kill they
parent and they parent friend
dark and loom figure of a man walk in front of a wall
of fire a black shadow blurred by wave of heat



he burn down the house they live in and
the store they work in he kill people
that owe they money
and like that he be
go
underground
no one have ever see
he again
he become a myth a spook
story that criminal tell they kid at
night

Kujans eye flash alle over the bulletin board

picture of rabin in the far corner
he stand beside a scale
in fish gear

caught marlin
he eye skim quickly over and stop on an
eight and a half by eleven inch fax sheet of what must be a

Kujan glaze over he name it

Kujan be in too much of a hurry to notice the two word
printed on the jagged piece that have be the bottom of the
cheap mug



Kujan be sprinting wildly down the hall for the stairs


verbal look behind he and see standing just
inside the doorway light a cigarette
the cop notice
verbal and watch he in the way that cop look at people
they cannot place in the category of idiot citizen or stupid

look of absolute confusion on he face

i
of the grace and coordination of a sculptor flick the
clasp on the antique lighter with the thumb striking the
flint with the index finger
it be a fluid motion somewhat
showy
verbal light a cigarette and smile to himself
he turn and
see the car running alongside
jack beer pull the sheet out of the fax machine and turn it
over revealing the composite sketch of keyser
though crude and distort one cannot help but notice how
much it leak like
the car stop
the driver get out
or the man we have come to know as such
he
smile to verbal
verbal step off of the curb returning the
smile as he open the passenger door and get in
the man called kobayashi get in the driver seat and pull
away
moment late agent david Kujan of you

custom wander
into the frame looking around much in the way a child would
when lost at the circus
he take no notice of the car
pulling out into traffic blend in with the rest of the
car filled with people on they way back to work
