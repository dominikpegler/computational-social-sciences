turn
back

sure i could
if i be looking
for one
Rachels turn to be surprise
confuse

you be a moron kid
you guess
the wrong secret
an odd almost defiant look
jackie reach up to she own head
and
slowly holding eye contact all the way she slip the wig from
she head
she scalp covered by the partial regrowth that chemo
therapy have left she
you can hear Rachels clear to kansas

charlie drummond used to be a
colleague at random house
i be
crashing at she place while i take
some new protein injection i
oncologist recommended
i can only
get they in san francisco
Rachels lip part
but no sound come

life a tradeoff
you get cancer
you hair fall out but you
get
to smoke dope

you be not die
the kid so painfully sincere

no such luck
i be beating the shit
out of this
pardon i french
rachel can not find she breath
she be clearly the bad off of the
two in this moment
then she start to nod

you bet you be

how the hell would you know

food you live on pork rind and
HoHos and

make a face


graceful stone build with arch window
gas lantern on the
exterior wall and burning dimly inside
stone gargoyle smile down
on those who enter the heavy bright red wooden door


drink hour
upscale crowd
dim light clink of glass the hum
of private conversation sidebyside
civilized as hell
and at
the deuce by the window
the mane head be down
we can not see lukes expression as he
stare at he clench hand
we do not need to

i think a phone call be
inappropriate
no one smile at the irony
not much to smile about

i could have taken you to that
restaurant but it would have
be a waste of money
he loo up
she study the pain

i know

set the beer down
stab out she smoke

we have to deal with that
and walk off slowly
across the yard


huge indoor space
Woodsided wall dirt floor
high corrugated
metal roof with bird flying roosting in rafter
little
under the keen eye of she put she mount through it
pace
in the cold air steam rise from the horse body
it be
late no one else around
now
down a walkway
toward the stable
barn cat be crouched
stalking prey
we hear a soft voice speaking
one we know



it be like telling she
see he now
standing awkwardly against the side of a stall

that i do not love she anymore
see the horse still steaming
standing patiently

if i could be sure i would always
stay
circle the horse now we see Annabelles back
she be slowly
brushing out the sweat mark
where the saddle used to be
she
movement be stiff mechanical
the soft voice continue



she said this thing you call a
partnership
the schedule the
chore all the thing we have to
work out

we to see at last Annabelles face




for the kid

the tear that stand in she eye
the set line of she small mouth




that be the life i dream of
and it be all i ever wanted it to be

she swallow
because she will not cry



that be the kind of person you mom be
she be the good
annabelle say nothing
she drop to she knee
begin to clean
out one of she horse hoof with a metal pick
the only sound
against the stillness
and she father watch
he heart pound

she shake she head very slightly
and she eye water

that be a plan


the dimly chic bar
with it soft upscale buzz
where jackie
told luke she have cancer
tonight she wait alone
watch the
entrance
nursing she drink
and then
rachel come into the place
spot jackie across the room
weave she way through the table
and she be there
slip into she seat
not knowing what to
say

thanks for coming out

neutral ground
what be up
jackie stare evenly
she chin rest across the back of she
knuckle
she look tire but okay
fuel by adrenaline

luke called
he say you be
checking out
of the heartbreak
hotel
the waitress appear
rachel too locked into the moment to notice
so

she like a Stolie no ice

double
as the woman leave

what be this about
because
we

do not flatter yourself
i always liked that line
sign

i love luke i love the child
but there be more to life than
even love

no there be not

and i have look down the road
at what i life will be
and i
can not handle it
jackie unblinking
focus strong

what do you see
down that road

sharing it with you be one thing
carry it alone the rest of i
life

but you want it

some truth here
the Stolie arrive
they wait a beat
the waitress disappear

well it be the jack kennedy syndrome
huh
you die young you always look
golden
perfect
the memory kind of
burnishes the image and

come on a wuss like i
the stiff
who would not help she own daughter
fight back

maybe i be wrong on that one
that sit there
in it sincerity

well maybe you be not
and so do that
tear be form in Rachels eye
here in
this public place

look when i said i could not channel
you
that do not mean i would not give
i right arm to do just that
shake she head

maybe i do not want to be looking over
i shoulder
every day for twenty
year
knowing someone else would
have do it right
the way i can not
jackie wait
think

trade you a smoke
for a secret
the way she said that
something weighty behind it
so rachel
reach into she purse

in a supermarket
Rachels hand freeze
in midcourse
