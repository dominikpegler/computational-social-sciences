hanna schmitz

yes

can you speak loud please

i name be hanna schmitz

thank you
you be born on october
st


yes

at Hermannstadt
and you be now
year old

yes

you joined the in

yes

what be you reason
what be you
reason for joining

you be working at the siemens
factory at the time

yes

you would recently be offered a
promotion
why do you prefer to
join the

i will rephrase i question
i be
trying to ascertain if she joined
the freely
of she own free
will

well

i hear there be job

go on


i be working at siemens when i
hear the be recruiting

do you know the kind of work you would
be expected to do

they be looking for guard
i
applied for a job

and you worked first at auschwitz

yes

until
then you be moved to
a small camp near cracow

yes

be you

i be fine

you then helped move the prisoner
west in the winter of in the
socalled death march

so what do you think


i do not know
it be not quite what
i expect

be not it
in what way
what be
you expect

i think it be exciting

excit

yes

why
why do you think it exciting

because it be justice

i need to correct an impression
dieter said yesterday this be
about justice
but be it


if it be about justice you might
ask why have it taken so long
the
war end twenty year ago
remember there be no
significant trial between
nuremburg in and the auschwitz
trial a couple of year ago
that be a long gap
what be the
reason for the gap

i would have think it be obvious

say

cowardice
it be cowardice be not
it
it be bad conscience
it be the
big coverup

go on

after the war
the german people
do not want to look at what they would
do

be that right

because they have too much to hide
all we parent be liar
all
right mine be
so it be left to
we be not it

how so

because we be not implicated

be not you
good
so that be all
right then


no but seriously dieters right
i parent i can not even talk to
they
i do not love they
how could
i
how could anyone love they
because they have tell themselves so
many lie they can not remember the
truth let alone admit it
be not
that why we signed up for this
seminar

i do not know
you tell i

speaking for myself

michael

i be not sure any more

what do you father do dieter

if you want to know he be in the
waffen

that be what i mean that be what i be
saying
so be a million other
german

that be exactly i point
that be why
it be good not to pretend this be
about justice
forgive i nor be
it about get into an emotional
state
it have no purpose if it be
just the young giving they parent
a bad time

so what be it about
what do you
think


society think they operate by
something called morality
but they
do not
they operate by something
call law
you be not guilty of
anything merely by working at
auschwitz
people worked at
auschwitz
precisely have be
convict and only for murder
to prove murder you have to prove
intent
that be the law
remember
the question be never be it
wrong
but be it legal
and not
by we law no by the law at the
time

but be not that

what

narrow

yes
the law be narrow

on the other hand i suspect people
who kill other people tend to be
aware that it be wrong

miss schmitz you be familiar with
this book

yes

part of it have already be read
out in court


it be an american publication which
have be translate
it be by a
survivor a prisoner who survive
ilana mather

yes i know
i know ilana mather

she be in the camp be not she
when she be a child
she be with
she mother

in the book she describe a
selection process
at the end of
the month labour every month
sixty inmate be selected
they
be pick out to be send from the
satellite camp back to auschwitz
that be right be not it

yes it be right

and so far each of you fellow
defendant have specifically denied
be part of that process
now i be
going to ask you
be you part of
it

yes

so you helped make the selection

yes

you admit that
then tell i how
do that selection happen


there be six guard so we
decided we would choose ten people
each
that be how we do it every
month
we would all choose ten

be you saying you fellow
defendant take part in the
process

we all do

even though they have denied it
but
you admit it
you be saying you
take part in the process

do you not realise you be
sending these woman to they
death

yes but there be new arrival
new woman be arriving all the
time so of course we have to move
some of the old one on

i be not sure you understand

we could not keep everyone
there
be not room

no but what i be saying
let i
rephrase
to make room you be
picking woman out and saying you
you and you have to be send back to
be killed



well what would you have do

so should i never have signed up at
siemens

ms
mather they be ready for you
now

in you book you describe the
process of selection

yes
you be make to work and
then when you be no longer any
use to they then they send you
back to auschwitz to be killed


be there people here today who
make that selection

yes

i need you to identify they
can
you please point they out

she
and she
and she
and she
and
she
and she

each of the guard would choose a
certain number of woman
hanna
schmitz choose differently

in what way differently

she have favourite
girl mostly
young
we all remark on it she
give they food and place to sleep
in the evening she ask they to
join she
we all think well
you can imagine what we think

then we find out she be making
these woman read aloud to she
they
be reading to she
at first we
think this guard this guard be
more sensitive she be more human
she be kind
often she choose the
weak the sick she picked they
out she seem to be protecting
they almost
but then she
dispatch they
be that kind


i want to move on now to the march
as i understand it you and you
daughter be march for many
month

yes
it be the winter of
we
camp be closed down we be tell
we have to move on
but the plan
keep changing every day
woman be
dying all around we in the snow
half of we die on the march
i
daughter say in the book less a
death march more a death gallop

please tell we about the night in
the church

that night we actually think we
be lucky because we have a roof
over we head
we would arrive in a
village as always the guard take
the good quarter they take the
priest house
but they let we
sleep in a church
there be a
bomb raid
in the middle of the
night
at first we could only hear
the fire it be in the steeple
then we could see burn beam
and they begin to crash to the
floor
everyone rush rushed to
the door
but the door have be
locked on the outside


the church burned down
nobody come
to open the door
be that right

nobody

even though you be all burning to
death

how many people be killed

everyone be killed

how do you survive

i needed to get away from the other
woman
because they be panicking
they be screaming
i could not
stand it
i could not stand they
screaming
i be more frighten of
the other woman than i be of the
fire
so i too i daughter and lead
she to the upper floor
i can not
defend what i do
it be impossible
to defend
i take ilana in i arm
and i lead she towards the fire
there be a small gallery at the
side of the church on the upper
level
it saved we live
the
gallery do not burn

thank you
i want to thank you for
coming to this country today to
testify


i do not know
i do not know what
we be do any more

do not you

you keep telling we to think like
lawyer but there be something
disgusting about this

how so

this do not happen to the german
it happen to the jew

what be we trying to do

we be trying to understand

six woman locked three hundred jew
in a church and let they burn
what be there to understand
tell
i i be asking
what be there to
understand

i start out believe in this
trial i think it be great now
i think it be just a diversion

yes
diversion from what

you choose six woman you put they
on trial you say they be the
evil one they be the guilty
one
brilliant


because one of the victim happen
to write a book
that be why they be
on trial and nobody else
do you
know how many camp there be in
europe

people go on about how much do
everyone know
who know
what
do they know
that be not the
question
the question be how
could you let it happen
and
well why do not you kill
yourself when you find out


thousands
that be how many
there
be thousands of camp
everyone
know

look at that woman

which woman

the woman you be always stare at
i be sorry but you be

i do not know which woman you mean

you know what i would do
put the gun
in i hand i would shoot she myself


why do you not unlock the door

why do you not unlock the door

i have ask all of you and i be
get no answer
two of the
victim be in this court
they
deserve an answer

here this be the report
you
all have copy


this be the report which be
written approved and signed by all
of you immediately after the event
in the written report you all
claim you do not even know about
the fire until after it happen
but that be not true be it

well
it be not true

i do not know what you be asking

the first thing i be asking be why
do not you unlock the door

obviously
for the obvious reason
we could not

why
why could not you

we be guard
we job be to
guard the prisoner
we could not
just let they escape

i see
and if they escaped then
you would be blame you would be charged
you might even be executed

no

well then

if we opened the door then there
would have be chaos
how could we
have restored order


it happen so fast
it be
snow
the bomb there be
flame all over the village
then
the scream begin
it get bad
and bad
and if they would all come
rush out we could not just let
they escape
we could not
we be
responsible for they

so you do know what be happening
you do know
you make a choice
you let they die rather than risk
letting they escape

the other defendant have make an
allegation against you
have you
hear this allegation

they say you be in charge

it be not true
i be just one of
the guard

do you write the report

no
no
we all discuss what to
say
we all write it together

she write it
she write the report
she be in charge

be that true

no
and i do not write the report
do it matter who do


i need to see a sample of you
handwriting

i handwriting

yes
i need to establish who write
the report

i be sorry but i really do not see
how that be appropriate
nearly
twenty year have go by

somebody take she this piece of
paper

be you really going to compare
handwriting of twenty year ago
with handwriting of today

give she the paper
counsel
approach the bench

there be no need
i write the
report


you have be skip seminar

so

i have a piece of information
concerning one of the defendant
something they be not admitting

what information

you do not need i to tell you
it be
perfectly clear you have a moral
obligation to disclose it to the
court

it happen this information be
favourable to the defendant
it can
help she case
it may even affect
the outcome certainly the
sentencing

so

there be a problem
the defendant
herself be determined to keep this
information secret


moment please
please

what be she reason

because she be ashamed

ashamed
ashamed of what

have you spoken to she

of course not

why of course not

i can not
i can not do that
i can not
talk to she

what we feel be not important
it be
utterly unimportant
the only
question be what we do

if people like you do not learn from
what happen to people like i
then what the hell be the point of
anything

no
no
she taught herself to read
when she be in prison

what be the nature of you
friendship


when i be young i have an affair

i be not sure i can help you mr
berg
or rather even if i could
i be not will to

i be almost sixteen when i take up
with she
the affair only last a
summer
but

but what

i see
and do hanna schmitz
acknowledge the effect she would have on
you life

she would do much bad to other
people
i have never tell anyone

people ask all the time what i
learned in the camp
but the camp
be not therapy
what do you think
these place be
university
we
do not go there to learn
one
become very clear about these
thing

what be you asking for
forgiveness for she
or do you just
want to feel well yourself
i
advice go to the theatre if you
want catharsis
please
go to
literature
do not go to the camp
nothing come out of the camp
nothing


what she wanted
what she wanted
be to leave you she money
i have
with i

to do what

as you think fit

piece of
hair from we dog
some ticket to
opera i father have taken i to
it be not stolen for it content
it be the tin itself which be
valuable what you could do with
it

there be nothing i can do with this
money
if i give it to anything
associated with the extermination
of the jew then to i it will
seem like absolution and that be
something i be neither will nor
in a position to grant


i be think maybe an
organization to encourage literacy

good

good

do you know if there be a jewish
organization

i will be surprise if there be not
there be a jewish organisation for
everything
