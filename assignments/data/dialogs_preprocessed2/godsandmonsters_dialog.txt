old mansion or villa

after you then

i love the great horror film
and
yours be the good
the old dark
house
the invisible man
they
look great and have style
and
funny

this be the studio where i paint

nice
refuse to be
sidetrack
and you light and camera
angle
you be get to go back to
german silent movie to find
anything like it

time for you to leave

i be on i way

so mr
kay
what do you want to
know

everything
start at the
begin

i be born outside london the only
son of a minister who be a master
at harrow
grandfather be a
bishop
church of
church of
eng

mr
whale

yes

you father be a schoolmaster

of course
i attend eton it
would not do for a master son to
attend where he father taught
i
be to go up to oxford but the war
broke out and i never make it
the
great war you know
you have a
good war but we have a great one

you can not imagine what life be
like after the armistice
the
twenties in london be one long
bank holiday a break from
everything dour and respectable
i
have a knack with pencil and paper
so i be hired to design set for
stage production

thank you hanna
very nice

you can go now

there be one play in particular a
beautiful grim study of war called
journey end
every experience
director turned it down so i
offered myself bullying and
begging for the job
journey
end make the career of everyone
associated with it
it be only a
matter of time until hollywood
beckon

how much long before we get to
frankenstein

be i correct in assuming mr
kay
that it be not i you be interest
in only i horror picture

oh no i want to hear everything
you make twenty picture in all

Twentyone
the romantic comedy
and drama be much more to i
like
the horror picture be
trifle
grand guignol for the
mass

but it be the horror movie you will
be remember for

i be not dead yet mr
kay

no
i never said you be
or
will be soon

so
journey end bring you to
hollywood

i have a proposal mr
kay
this
mode of questioning be get old
do not you think

i do not mind

let we make it more interesting
i
will answer any question you ask
but for each answer you must
remove one article of clthe

that be funny mr
whale

it be be not it
i life as a game
of strip poker
shall we play

you be serious

quite

then the rumor be true

what rumor might those be

that you be forced to retire
because uh a sex scandal

homosexual scandal you mean
for i to answer a question of that
magnitude you will have to remove
both you shoe and you sock

you be a dirty old man

you be kind to indulge you elder
in they vice
as i indulge the
young in theirs

no
there be no scandal

i only other vice
i suppose
you would like a full answer to you
question

it will cost you you sweater

too warm for a sweater anyway

you must understand how hollywood
be twenty year ago
nobody care
a tinker cuss who sleep with
whom so long as you keep it out of
the paper
outside of hollywood
who know who george Cukor be much
less what he do with those boy
from the malt shop along santa
monica

george Cukor
who make star be
born
i never guess

take off you vest and i will tell
you a story

do not be shy
there be time to stop
before you go too far

i guess

george be famous for he saturday
dinner party
great artist
writer society folk all rub
elbow with hollywood royalty
but
how many of those ohsoproper
people know about the sunday
brunch that follow
gathering
of trade eating leftover follow
by some strenuous fun and frolic in
the pool
if a goat like that can continue
about he business i more
domestic arrangement could have
raised very few eyebrow

can we talk about the horror movie
now

certainly mr
kay
be there
anything in particular you want to
know

will you tell i everything you
remember about making
frankenstein

can that count as one question

of course

i can not believe i be do this

just like going swim be not it

maybe you would like a swim when we be
through
i never swim myself so
the pool tend to go to waste

okay
frankenstein
tell i
everything

righto
let i see

universal wanted i for another
story and wanted i so baldly i
mean badly not baldly
i be
given the pick of story be
developed and i picked that one

who come up with the monster
makeup and look

i idea
Muchly
i sketch
big heavy brow
head flat on top
so they could take out the old
brain and put in the new like
tin beef

he be one of the great image of the
twentieth century
as important as
the mona lisa

you think so
that be very kind

boris karloff

i return recently from a stay in
hospital

what be wrong

nothing serious
touch of
stroke

you must excuse i for stare mr
boone
but you have a marvelous
head

huh

to an artistic eye you understand
have you ever modele

you mean like pose for picture

sit for an artist
be sketched

what be to sketch

you have the most architectural
skull
and you nose
very
expressive

break be more like it

but expressively broken
how do
it happen

football in college

you go to university

just a year
i drop out to join
the marine

yes
you be a marine

i apologize for going on like this
it be the sunday painter in i
of
course i can understand you
refusal
it be a great deal to ask
of someone

you mean you really want to draw
i

indeed
i would pay for the privilege
of draw you head

but why

even an amateur artist need a
subject to inspire he

and it be just i head you want
nothing else

what be you suggest
you will
charge extra if i include a hand or
a bit of shoulder

you do not want to draw picture of
i in i birthday suit right

i have no interest in you body
mr
boone
i can assure you of
that

all right then
sure
i could use
the extra dough

excellent
we will have a most
interesting time


this be the area of infarction
by
which we mean the portion of brain
affected by the stroke


you be a lucky man mr
whale
whatever damage be do by you
stroke it left you motor
ability relatively unimpaired

yes yes dr
payne
but from the
neck up
what be i story there


that be what i be trying to explain


the central nervous system select
item from a constant storm of
sensation
whatever be killed in
you stroke appear to have
shortcircuited this mechanism
part of you brain now seem to be
firing at random

you be saying there be an electrical
storm in i head


that be as good a way as any to
describe it
i have see far bad
case
you might even learn to
enjoy these walk down memory lane

but the rest of it
the kill
headach
the phantom smell
i
inability to close i eye without
think a hundred thing at once
it be all nothing more than bad
electricity


in a manner of speaking
i have
never encounter the olfactory
hallucination but i be sure
they be related

so what do i do


take the luminal to sleep or
whenever you feel an attack coming
on

you seem to be saying that this
be not just a case of resting until
i be good
that i condition will
continue to deteriorate until the
end of i life

do not worry you already paid i
i be here because

the master be waiting for you

he be down in he studio
here
take this with you

it be you job lady not mine
i be here so he can draw i picture

i be keeping away
what you be
doing be no business of mine

what be you talking about

what kind of man be you
be you
a good man

yeah i be a good man
something
make you think i be not

you will not hurt he

give i a break
i be going to sit on
i ass while he draw picture
be
that going to hurt he

no
no
i be sorry
forget everything i
say
here
i will take the tray

very good hanna
now goodbye

i be sure you would like something to
wet you whistle while i work

we will go slowly today
since this
be you first time as a model

do you see this
they be showing
one of you movie tomorrow night

you do not say
which picture

bride of frankenstein


hmmm
i much prefer show boat or
the invisible man
shall we
begin

ready when you be

that shirt mr
boone

it be new

i be sorry
it be too white too
distract
would it be asking
too much for you to take it off

i be not wearing an undershirt

Pish posh mr
boone
i be not you
aunt tilly

but it be just i face you want to
draw

oh if it be going to make you
uncomfortable
perhaps we can find something else
for you to wear

we could wrap this like a toga
around you shoulder
would that
help you overcome you schoolgirl
shyness

all right already
i will take it
off
kind of warm in here anyway

yes
much well
here

i think we will have you sit slightly
sideways so you can rest one arm
on the back of the chair
yes
just so

take a picture it last longer

that be exactly what i intend to do

you seem to have no idea how
handsome you be mr
boone
it
have to do with how snugly you face
fit you skull

would you be more comfortable
barefoot
feel free to remove you
boot and sock

no
i be fine

it be a bit like be at the
doctor be not it
you have to
remain perfectly still while i
examine and scrutinize you

drip
do you ever eat dripping in this
country
the fat from roast and
such congeal in jar
used like
butter on bread

sound like something you feed the
dog

it be
only the poor family
ever eat it
we keep ours in a
crockery jar

you family eat dripping

of course not
as i said only
poor people

i be sorry
i have just realized how
terribly ironic it all be

what

i have spent most of i life
outrun i past
now it be
flooding all over i

there be something about the
openness of you face that make i
want to speak the truth
yes i
family eat dripping
beef dripping
and four to a bed and a privy out
back in the alley
be you also
from the slum mr
boone

we be not rich
but we be not
poor either

no you be middle class like all
american

i guess you would say we live on the
wrong side of the track

in dudley there be more side of
the track than any american can
imagine
every englishman know
he place
and if you forget
there be always someone to remind
you
i family have no doubt about
who they be
but i be an
aberration in that household a
freak of nature
i have imagination
cleverness joy
where do i get
that
certainly not from they

they take i out of school when i
be fourteen and put i in a
factory
they mean no harm
they
be like a family of farmer
who have be given a giraffe and
do not know what to do with the
creature except harness he to the
plow

hatred be the only thing that keep
i soul alive in that soulkilling
place
and among those man i hated
be i own poor dumb father
who
put i in that hell to begin with



mr
whale

boone

overcome with nostalgia

i do not mind

stretch you leg

selfconscious
you will have to
remove you shirt

sorry
not today

but we have to match the other
sketch

i just feel more comfortable
keeping it on
you just said you
do not want i selfconscious

perhaps if we open the shirt and
pull

oh dear
i
have
make you
nervous

i be fine
i would just rather keep it
on

suppose we unbutton the top and
pull it down around you shoulder
two button
be that so much to
ask
just two little button

no
look
what you told i at
lunch be still very weird for i
so either you sketch i like i be
or i will say forget it and go do
you hedge

i do not mean to be a prick but
that be how i feel

of course
i do not want to scare
you off
not before i be finished
with you

tell i more about yourself mr
boone
you have a steady
companion

not at the moment

why not

you know how it be
you have to
kiss ass just to get a piece of it

very well put

the world be just one kissass game
after another
man have to make
up he own life alone

ah
philosopher

thoreau with a lawnmower

i like that
but take care mr
boone
freedom be a drug much
like any other
too much can be a
very bad thing

be that why you and you friend
split up
because you wanted to be
free

in a way yes
i suppose so
i
know it be why i stopped making
picture

you might not think it to look at
i now but there be a time when i
be at the very pinnacle of i
profession
the horror movie be
behind i
i would do show boat

major success
great box office
now i be to do something
important
the road back

indictment of the great war and
what it do to germany
it be to
be i masterpiece

what happen

the fuck studio butcher it
it be hitlers army be
already massing and still the
new york banker stand in line to
curry he favor
anything to avoid
losing the german market
they cut
away the guts and bring in
another director to add slapstick
the picture laid an egg a great
expensive bomb
for which i be
blame

after that i go out of fashion
i be no longer able to command
the good project so i walk
away
why should i spend i time
working in such a dreadful business

do you miss it

it be so far in the past now
over
fifteen year

making movie be the most
wonderful thing in the world
work with friend
entertain people
yes i
suppose i miss it
more so now
that

i think we all want to feel we have
left we mark on the world
yes
i wish i have do more work

you have do a helluva lot more
than most people

good work

but i choose freedom
david be
still in the thick of it he life
full of anxiety and studio
intrigue
i do not fancy spending
i golden year as merely the
friend
the dirty little secret
of a nervous producer

how long be you

like a play whose run outlast the
caste ability to keep it fresh

the only memento i ever keep
i

i be sure you come across
such situation in korea

wound comrade or perhaps one of
the enemy
someone for whom death
would be a bless

i never go

i never make it to korea

but you said

that i be a marine
which be
true
you filled in the rest

i see

i old man be a marine
he
enlist the day he turned
seventeen

the great war

by the time he be ready to ship
out the fight be over
he
missed out

very lucky thing indeed

that be not the way he see it
to
he it be like he life never get
start
nothing else really
matter
definitely not his
family

the morning after pearl harbor he
drive down to st
louis to
reenlist
he be so damn excite
world war be going to be he
second chance
they told he he be too old
fat
nearsighted
say he would be more
use to he country if he stay
home and look after he family

be that why you joined the marine
for you father sake

i figure he would think you know
it be the next good thing
hey i

part of something important
something big than yourself

hard he practically burst a blood
vessel

yard from the line too far out

evening standto
good morning
barnett we would say each day
how be ole barnett looking this
morning
seem a little peaky

hat shielded he eye so one could
imagine he be nap on
bedspring
he hung there until we
be relieve
we introduce he
to the new unit before we march
out speaking highly of he
companionship

oh but we be a witty lot
