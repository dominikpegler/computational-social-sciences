the th duke

all business read
from a printout
of albany
he be the
the
son of emery and eliza
he be of no
actual importance until he vanished
at the turn of the century without a
trace
it be a sensation
in the
s they even make a movie about
he
the tenuous duke with ronald
coleman


i love ronald coleman

despite much speculation and a nation
wide investigation a body be never
find
he be never hear from again


until now


we have altered the course of history


we never should have start this

calm down


what be we going to do
we can not
keep he here
imagine if anyone
find out

think
just think
rationally
now
no one would believe such a stupid
mistake could be make because no one
would believe any of this be possible
so
we fix this
we keep this to
ourselves and we fix it
fast

dr
Kau research all we data
st
priority
locate carlson
drake
determine the reciprocal correlation
connected to the th century
work
hour a day if necessary
in the
meantime
one of we will have to
take charge of he

this be a major scientific
opportunity
it do not get any good
than this
imagine
research the
behavior the physical and emotional
characteristic of a century ago
utilize technology available to we
today
he be a gold mine


he be a man kate
not a guinea pig

and while he be here he be ours
any
volunteer


we will draw name
whoever be be pick
will be responsible
agreed

fine

where
what have happen

you grace
um

research team
project funded by
the government of the united states

regarding they
appearance with
distaste
oh
american
i see

yes um
for the past six and a
half year we have be conducting
scientific experiment on density
and flexibility in the dimension of
time and space


yes uh
quite by accident we come
upon a formula utilize tachyon
particle travel fast than the
speed of light which allowed we
to
fold time so to speak


yes
bend it between the crack of
the dimension


yes


now while that be not the original
purpose of we experiment we opt
to pursue it well privately on
we own


borrow fund already provide

we journeyed to you time because it
be the quick path to follow
we
debate long and hard whether we
should use this knowledge at all
believe i it be never we intent
to disturb the past


merely to discover if the expedition
be possible
as you presence here
confirm
we be very disturbed


the problem facing we be not only
to get you back but you
see

we certainly do not want to
miscalculate
send you to a different
era entirely


rest assured no harm will come to
you
you will be well look after by
dr
coles
