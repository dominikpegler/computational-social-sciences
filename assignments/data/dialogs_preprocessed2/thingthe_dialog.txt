and scare the shit out of they
and
they get into one hell of a brawl

now how be this motherfucker wake up
after thousands of year in the ice
huh

i do not know how
because he be
different than we be
because he be
a space guy
what do you want from
i anyway
go ask blair

you buy any of this blair

it be here
get to that dog
it
be here in this camp

so
so what
it be over with

well be not it

whatever that norwegian dog be
it
it be capable of changing it
form
when it attacked we dog
it
somehow be able to digest
or
absorb it
and in the process shaped
it own cell to imitate we doge
cell exactly
hold up gooey dog
leg
this for instance be not dog at
all it be imitation
we get to
it before it have time to finish or

finish what

i think the whole process would
have taken an hour
maybe more
and then i suppose both would have
changed back to dog form

well that thing in the ice sure
be not no dog

of course not
but whatever it be
revived it
well the thing be
probably disoriented
and realized
it could not survive for long in we
atmosphere
but be the incredibly
adaptable creature it be
it tried
to become something that could
before the norwegian killed it
it somehow get to this dog

what do you mean get to the dog

it be a life form that be able to
imitate and reproduce whatever it
eat or absorbed cell for cell

the concept be stagger
i know
i
i do not fully understand it
myself

you be saying
that big muther in
the ice become the dog

i think we be talking about an
organism
that could imitate other
life form
perfectly
it could
have go on and on
it could have
become one dog
it could have become
as many dog as it wanted to and
without losing any of it original
mass

you be into childs weed blair

look i know it be hard to believe

so what be we problem

well
there be still some cell
activity
it be not entirely dead
yet




in violent
protestation
you can not do this
you can not burn
these remains

and the horse you ride in on fuchs
light it up

well i be not going to let this
happen

i just can not believe it
we be
going to go down as the big bunch
of asshole in history

fuck history
at least we be going
to live to be an old bunch of
asshole


clark do you notice anything strange
about that dog
just anything at
all
any little thing

just that he recovered real
quick
that night when i find he
in the rec room he have already
scraped off he bandage

mutherfucker
i be telling you this



could be one of they

hold on damn it
we be get
nowhere
if this bit of Blairs
about absorb and imitate be
true
then that dog could have
get to anybody


and if it get to clark
clark could
have get to anybody


theoretically any of we could be
whatever the hell this thing be

it be just too damn wild i can not
believe it

well you can believe it now

Nauls find this yesterday
it be
ripped just like the clthe on the
norwegian we bring back
the same
thing be happening to Bennings
clothes when it get to he
seem
these thing do not imitate clothes
just flesh and bone

size large
what do you wear clark

so what

i wear a size large too

so do i
so do most of we

doubt if it get to more than one or
two of we
but it get to someone
somebody in this room be not what he
appear to be

well what we going to do

can there be
some kind of test
to find out who be what


serum test possibly

right
why not

what be that


it be a simple blood typing test
this thing blood chemistry be
different than ours
basically we
mix someone blood with
uncontaminated human blood
if we
do not get the proper serum reaction
then that person be not human

whose uncontaminated blood we going
to use


we have get blood plasma in storage

how long will it take you to prepare
this


couple of hour

well get to it

how be that thing get to the dog
i
though we stopped it in time

copper think they swallowed piece
of it during the fight

and that be enough




garry
the rest of you
come here


somebody get to the blood
sabotage
it

oh i god

be it broken into

no
somebody opened it
close it
and then locked it

well who be get access to it


i guess i be the only one

and i have get the only key

would that test have work


i think so

somebody else sure as hell think
so

who else could have used that key

ah
no one
i give it to copper
when he need it

could anyone have get it from
you


i do not see how
when i be finished
i return it right away

when be the last time you used it


day or so ago
i guess

i suppose
well it be possible
someone might have lift it from
i
but

that key ring of yours be always
hook to you belt
now how could
somebody get to it without you
knowing

look i have not be near that
that refrigerator

copper the only one who have any
business with it


now
wait a second garry you have
be in here on several occasion

and the doc think of the test

so what
be that suppose to leave
he in the clear
bullshit

hey sanchez


put that down

no

i will put this right through you
head

you guy going to let he give order
i mean he could be one of those
thing

put it away sanchez
just put it
away

i do not know about copper
but i
do not go near that plasma
but i guess you will all rest easy
if someone else be in charge

can not see anyone objecting to you
norris

sorry gentleman
do not think i would be up to it
have not be feeling well lately

i will take it

maybe it should be someone a bit
more eventempered childs

any objection

from what we know this thing like
to go one on one
so we stick together
as much as possible
in twoes and
three

what do we do about those three

we get morphine do not we

well we keep they load
stash
they here in the rec room and watch
they twentyfour hour

morphine
you know i be pretty close
to that dog too

we should sleep in shift

right
half of we awake at all time

how we going to try and find out
who be
you know who be who

can you think of any other test

i will try
i could sure use copper
help though

you can eightysix that think right
now man

also
when this thing turn
it
turn slowly at first
i think we
can handle it in that state
but if
it ever get to full power
from
what i see of that norwegian camp
well i just do not know
it would
probably take it an hour or more to
get like that
so no matter what
anybodies do we all return to
this room every twenty minute
anybody go longer than that
anybody trying to leave
we kill
they


where be that magneto
can not find a
darn thing around here any more


i will do it
you be going to break
the needle in i arm

no doc
he be do a real fine job

look for shoe too
and burn cloth

that thing too smart to be hide
any more of it clothes macready

just keep looking
