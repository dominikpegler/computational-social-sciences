right now i be putting the final
touch on a new invention of i
creation
i call it
the
impermeable
it be a vest that
when worn under the clthe can
stop any modern bullet fired even
at close range

really

but it have not be really
tested empirically yet

and unnecessary
if one have do
one proper planning

yeah
how do you feel about a
fist

i must tell you mr
west i have
always feel that allow a
situation to degenerate into
physical violence be a failure on
i part

west you bring
this on yourself

i love this train

suggestion on how to make the
wanderer both comfortable and
functional

you may want to avail yourself
of i Subcarriage Interrail
Egressor

about we putting aside we petty
difference

be she would get in we way and i would
probably wind up gettin in the

futility

wanderer impervious to attack

hardly
completely armor
plate

an attacker would find the

Lovelesss into a mountain tunnel
the
wanderer be just behind it
and go into the tunnel
second later


the wanderer out of the tunnel
in the f
g
we
might notice a metal post that extend up



coleman squint ahead
he see the track up ahead be
empty
no loveless

be i missin something here


up on metal stilt
it let we the wanderer pass underneath
it
then it lower itself back down onto the track
the leg fold to the side and the tanktrain pursue it
pursuer


loveless turn to he three distaff warrior

amazonia shall we disabuse we
friend of the notion that one
problem be solve when we see
the light at the end of the
tunnel
as Munitia swivel the cannon barrel

thru thru



west and gordon be about to head forward when gordon
glance out the back grab west
rev




jim we be the one chasing
loveless correct
as west shoot
he a look
then perhaps you could explain
what they be do behind we
as west look out the back too

she will
just to the right of they
now
to the left of they
the wanderer rock
precariously from wheel to wheel throwing a scream
rita back and forth between west and gordon

they could not fire the cannon at
we from in front
any other
question



west jump up on the pool table

would it put you out too much to
throw i a rope and hit you
little secret button
with a shrug gordon toss west a rope and hit the
same hide button he have during they fight
whoosh
west be go as the pool table flip over
as rita
cover she mouth in amazement

i taught he how it worked


west hang upsidedown
he handoverhands himself
back to the escape trolley
he slide he back on top of
it then lower it onto the track
little wheel fit on the inside of the track
once
coupled west release the cable and he shoot backwards



gordon open a panel in the floor and snap up a winch
with a large handle
he start to crank it slowly
letting out cable




out the back door we see west emerge from under the
wanderer head for Lovelesss tanktrain

suddenly there be a



the
of the can not take the pressure and they be flying
off the


gordon realize another invention of he need some
tweak snap out he pen and pad
as he scribble a
note rita consider the exotic pen holder

you know you could put a gun on
that thing
gordon look up at she disapprovingly
not you too
meanwhile on the track


off he wire tether he fly backwards at mph



it look like he head about to be smashed by
Lovelesss tanktrain


rita turn away bury she head in gordons shoulder
just as


west slide under the train
he lie flat as the death
over he
at the last second he lassos
the rope around the rear axle
it slow he for a
beat
then stretch
he be get gordons trick rope
we see he silent scream artemus
he slide way
behind the tanktrain then spring back
past the
tanktrain
finally west slide back underneath and
manage to grab hold of they caboose
he swing his
leg up pull himself around onto the step
rev



west make he way forward to the smokestack
he try
to flip the flue closed steam scald he hand
he
do not see hudson come at he from behind
he wrap a
garrote around wests neck pull it tight practically
crushing he larynx


Munitia be bent over have she eye to the cannon sight
as she squint through the smoke at the wanderer up ahead
loveless sit behind she have he full attention
focused on she tuchus

i have they square in i sight
sire

as do i Munitia
as do i
fire away
but it be a little difficult with he stroke she
buttock

the



gordon and rita be looking out the back when they see
the late missile headed they way
gordon pull rita
down at the last second as a huge steel arrow shoot
through the door past they head
and into the parlor
wall
as metal barb flick out locking the tip in and the
steel chain it be attached to draw tight


west and hudson roll around precariously
west claw
desperately at the garrote
it look grim for we hero
until he knock he boot heel together

he
appear
summon he last ounce of strength he mulekicks
sink the blade into hudsons leg
west grab he and
shove he head first into the smokestack
the big
indian plug it up like a cork in a bottle



loveless have only a moment to gloat over he marksmanship
before the compartment begin filling with smoke
choke cloud that send loveless et al into coughing
fit

close the fire door
just in time amazonia swing it shut as the unvented
sending a ripping through the
back of the train destroy it
up ahead


gordon and rita be throw across the car along with
everything else inside as Lovelesss train sudden
stop
jerk they with it
the of
on be sickening
they clutch onto
one another
as the wanderer skid to a stop
as they pick themselves up gordon look to rita who be
shaken up and scare
now coming up the
stairs

i will not let loveless take i
again
i would rather be dead

ball roll between he foot spew a purple cloud of
sleep gas
west give gordon a wile

too damn late be what it be


sea of corn tassel waving in the wind
Lovelesss

he feel
the metal band around he neck and survey the inch
wire fence which have be laid around they in a circle
west be about to step over it
gordon grab he leg




do not move


loveless be sitting in he wheelchair fifty yard from
west and gordon
on Lovelesss elbow sit miss
Lippenreider

west and gordon

continue miss Lippenreider

do both voice
in a monotone
west
let go of i leg
gordon
listen to i
loveless collare
we with the same metal device we
find on morton
loveless turn to Munitia who be loading two inch
diameter metal disc into what look like a
changerclaypigeonthrower

oh Munitia

going to leave evidence behind
like we do last time

nitro this time sire
as she arm the device and a red light come on

good morning gentleman

west and gordon squint through the corn see loveless on
they train

how familiar
rita
be sleeping off the aftereffects
in the stateroom
quite lovely be not she
who
know
i might even become
familiar with she myself
gordon take a step
west stop he

and that would become one more
reason why i be going to kill you

yes mr
west i be sure a well
endowed blackamoor like yourself
must find it absolutely
impossible
that a freak like i
could fully enjoy the pleasure of
a woman
but have witness i
use of mechinology so far
would not you think i could provide
myself with something for the
low half of i body that be
hardpumping and indefatigably
steely
loveless look


and speaking of hard
pump
mr
coleman full
steam ahead


in the engine room
amazonia have a gun to he head


loveless take he last shot at they from the back

what a marvelous train
you do not
mind if i borrow it do you
gentleman




other than a lack of wheelchair
access i find it a most
comfortable way to pass the long
mile from here to i laboratory
in spider canyon
louder as they
move off
i will be seeing president grant
soon at promontory point
what
shall i tell he for you
i be
afraid it can not be that you be
alive and well
and as he maniacal giggle hang in the air


frustrated as the train pull away from they
west tug
at the metal collar around he neck

gordon get out you little tool
kit and get this damn thing off of
i
gordon unbuttons he shirt to reveal he leather tool
kit
empty except for a note
gordon open it and
read

gentleman welcome to the
loveless experimental camp for
political dissident
there be
no guard
no barbed wire
as
long as you stay within the
designate perimeter you will
stay alive



miss Lippenreider be still eavesdrop for loveless
through bino

west
how do you know it be not
just bullshit
gordon
step over
the fence and find out
rita and
i will put flower on you grave
every year



stand next to the little fence watch loveless
escape

i do not have time for this

wait i have an auxiliary tool
kit
gordon peel back the top of he boot revealing it
but
it be too late
west have jump over the fence
then he
hop back inside it
he hold he hand out to gordon

see
nothing happen
west grab gordon by the back of he vest and yank he
over the fence
now they hear a slight in the
air and it be not a bee

come whipping over the corn straight for wests head
in a split second he duck and the disc cut the top of
the corn off and bank around for a new attack

oh really
now both of they step over the fence perimeter and start
running like hell through the cornfield

be it too late to take it off of
i now


the second disc machine light turn green and the second
disc be launch


loveless be laughing he head off
certain of gordons
and wests impending death he roll he wheelchair
inside
rev



be awaken from the effect of the billiard ball gas
and try to control she sense of dread and loathing
she smile nervously at loveless who be be fawnedover
by he woman

caviar

Blini

open champagne
bottle
rita i dear not that i be
ungrateful to providence for
bringing you back to i
rita jump as the champagne

i be just a wee bit curious as
to how you manage to wind up with
they

well they uh
seem so
sure
that they could find you
and i
think if i stay with they
they would lead i back to
all i
friend
Munitia shoot a look at Lippenreider

and not to give you a big head
but
wrinkle she nose
to loveless
i kinda missed you

be not that a coincidence
i miss
i too


come running we
behind and above be two disc
about to make a dive at they



the disc like giant razor be mow off the top of
the corn stalk heading straight for they head
west and gordon dive to the ground
the disc just
missing they
west stand to run again
we see the back
of he head be buz


running a zigzag pattern toward the end of the cornfield
west see a gully fifty yard ahead of they

head for that gully
west zig out of the cornfield one way
gordon zag out
the other
they be both beatup and exhaust from
running and flop on the ground


breathlessly reach the edge
and look down


it be no gully
it be a canyon that drop foot down
to a ribbon of brown water
and that be not the bad of
it


west be on the other side of the precipice
they be
separated by about foot of air
they both see the disc closing in
think fast

when i give the signal
jump off
the cliff into i arm

be you crazy
do you see what be
down there

watch the disc
approach
five four three two
west hold out he arm
rev




forget it
i be not do it

one
west take a leap of faith
and finally so do
gordon

oh shit

meet midair
they drop just as
the
two disc collide with a that be hear
by


loveless raise he glass to rita make a little kiss
gesture
she look like she would like to kill herself



be still in midair both looking down

i just remembered
i can not swim

you will not have to
they drop and we hear a


stick up to they neck in red riverbed mud
as they
slowly begin to extricate themselves

maybe i should have stay inside
that fence another moment or two

rev

up up up he go
as now more of the contraption come

giant metal tarantula step over the rim in full
terrifying glory
eight leg five story high
the thorax of the giant spider bristle with Gatling gun
and all manner of weaponry
as the shadow of the monster
pass over they face

advantage

archaic sepia diagram of a weird aircraft

the crowd who taken refuge behind it run away in
panic
all but one of they
second president grant
he calmly light a cigar on the
flaming train stride up to the other grant and
shout up at loveless

in matter of war the person to
talk to would be i
if there be anyone more surprise than the president
himself it be



loveless squint down at the two grant
this new
wrinkle have also attracted the attention of the
Lovelettes and everyone else aboard

now just who be you

the president

little puffy and overweight
as the president eye he puff on he cigar
GordonGrant ape he every move big mockingly

gordon you have get a lot of brass
where be west

GordonGrant shift he eye toward

and a sticky white silk shoot out covering both
grant with spider web material

well gordon

what be important
now Munitia hit a lever and they be hoist up off the
ground
they only get a couple of foot when

west shoot the mechanism and it jerk to a stop
all eye turn to the source of the sharpshooting


west have almost reach the low deck
now all the
firepower of the tarantula be trained on he



Amazonias on the Gatling gun
Munitia and several other
goon on low deck on west too


west take cover behind the steel girder

all he


but wests bullet as well as the union soldier
covering harmlessly against the tarantula


grow impatient with the gun battle
he pull a lever




down below nozzle on the tarantula leg suddenly
in cloud of skinscalding
west scream
in pain and fall
foot


to the ground he head hitting a rock
as the two
grant witness it the sticky spider ball



loveless wearing a black tunic festoon with medal
and a Prussianstyle helmet with a horse hair plume
raise he arm Nixonlike as a band play a flourish

bonjour buenas tardes and good

frame by a large flag feature the spider emblem he
look out from center stage of a greek theater at the
crowd of foreign dignitary seated around he

oh how long have we wait

dressed in tight Fascistbrown tankwear rise from they
seat and applaud
the only people not applaud be a
row of haggard bearded scientist and the manacled
prisoner gordon rita grant and
coleman

look to
englishman
be not it old bean
most expensive cup o tea in
history
as the englishman dignitary nod soberly


wests body have not moved
the only change be that now
a line of ant crawl across he face
we watch hope
for a twitch something
but there be none
the ant
march over lifeless eye swarm onto the bloody cut on
he head
if we be not convince he be dead

circle lower finally landing right by wests head
as
the hideous carrioneater lean over wests face

shadow fall across they
but instead of the peck
red beak a human hand appear the
brush the
ant away
we hear an over
then
finally
wests eyelid flutter open

standing over he
backlit by the sun the face
of wests indian friend
the healer who can turn himself
into a bird



as west sit up groggily feel he head
hey it be
okay
as he make a mental note to always be kind to
animal


loveless continue he speech to the foreign contingent

look to hudson
the indian
manhattan for a handful of bead
raise he hand
injunstyle
how
remember the alamo indeed
today i be proud to be able to sit
before you and tell you the wrong
will be right
the past make
present
the united divided
to thunderous applause
loveless signal for the flag to
be pull down revealing

there have be some significant internal change which
loveless now describe
the delegation from each country
stand when they hear they name

in the front row rita lean over to gordon

queen of spain

i be close




shut up and listen to a real
genius
finally loveless tap colorado kansas utah and nevada
now labelled as loveless land
smile impishly

and a tiny piece for i to retire
on
there be appreciative laughter


stumble in and look around discouraged
the place have be ransack
the gun cabinet be
empty the Gatling lamp remove
all that be leave be

in disgust


sit behind a desk that have be bring to center stage
loveless unroll a document sign he half of it

and i suppose
the threat of death to someone
with you valorous war record

we will start
by shooting you man gordon
loveless whirl nod to amazonia who drag the president

disappearing into
the chaos
meet i after the show
both west and gordon look after she with yearn as
three goon charge they
coleman amazed at they
torpor quickly grab a from the incinerated goon
and



three goon drop
gordon and west exchange look
not bad for an emphysemic old engineer

special marshal
president
think you needed some lookin
after
speaking of the president
he be grab a dead goon
and be a pretty good field of
himself
suddenly he get a tap on the shoulder from
behind
it be amazonia
whap she send a right to his
chin knocking he out
she throw he over she shoulder
and carry he away



as fire engulf the place loveless have no choice but to
retreat
for now
surround by a cadre of he woman
who carry the unconscious president grant loveless head
through a round
as amazonia swing the
door closed the foreign dignitary on the door
begging for admittance




monsieur we be you partner
you can not let we die in this
fire

it be not the first time you all have
be burned in america
he chuckle nod to amazonia who the closed



emerge from the smoke lair coughing and gasping for
breath
they watch helplessly as


out of the bowl with grant captive on the
bridge



this be diabolical
they have get
the president and i have still get
that silly song in i head

mon we get to go
we get to ride
horse
something
west be watch the tarantula turn to calm he

no arte
right now we need
a plan
gordon try to compose himself

that flyin machine idea of
yours
be you just acting like
you know what you be talking
about
or could you build it






an expanse of canvas comprise a foot wing
span
in the b
g
we hear gordon



now Bernoullis principle state
that the air flowing over a bird
wing
be moving at a low
pressure than the pressure below
the wing
that be called lift

course it be just a theory
it be
never be tested

it depict a wing cutting through the air
arrow
indicate airflow
circular line indicate life

only one problem it be upside down
gordon remedy
that
look sheepishly to west who like he be wearing
a leather flight jacket and goggle

you be not makin i feel any
well
now they attach the wing to the frame which be
connected to the Nitrocycle
coleman he everpresent cigarette dangle from his
mouth ready bomb from the gunpowder of cartridge and
gordons design
they look like flash gordons
spaceship
he pass they out

here a coupla bon voyage
present

coleman
must you smoke when
handle explosive
gordon grab they away from he and sit in the saddle of
the Nitrocycle
west look at coleman apologetically as
he stuff the bomb into he jacket

he be just a little nervous because
no one ever fly before
west be barely on the back when gordon kick it over and
they



build ground speed
gordon be nervous at the wheel
west give he an encourage pat

Avant
Avant
but they speed be not enough to get they airborne

we be not get enough lift
we need more speed
then in an uncharacteristic move by gordon he turn the
machine around and head for the cliff

hey uh
that be the cliff over
there you know
he gun the accelerator

yes i do know
and with that the Nitrocycle go off the cliff
it
disappear for the count of five
then suddenly it
swoop up and
they be flying



it worked
it worked

if you have to get one right i be
real glad it be this one

exhilarated with
Westlike abandon
Yeeehaaa
and with that they bank the desert wasp around and fly
off to save the republic


be enter the town



loveless turn to grant he face beaten and bruised

mr
president i will ask you once
again
sign the surrender or i
decimate this town

you have have i answer
Lovelesss face darken as amazonia hand he a tray of
cotton ball

i find the sound of people
screaming while they get blown to
smithereen ruin the ear for
music
do not you
he offer they to the president
grant swat they away

commence firing
and with that the tarantula on the town
there be a lot of stomp and smashing too


high above the tarantula
gordon lost in the joy of
flight turn to west who be more of a whiteknuckler

i think i will call it

lemme guess
an elevation enhancer

why would you
call it that

no air
gordon
now west point to the tarantula and chaos below

go down down there




you can not just go down there

flight depend on lift which must
be calibrate to the angle of
descent

shut up and go down there will
ya
west reach up shove the makeshift joystick forward
as the wasp plummet toward the bridge of the tarantula
and gordon strain to keep control


loveless and grant be oblivious to we hero above
he
unlock one of grant handcuff present he with a
pen

well mr
president

enough yet

sign the surrender or shall we set
a course for denver

suddenly there be a and



west and gordon swoop down low
west unfastens
from he vest wait for the right moment
as
they swing past the tarantula cannon he drop they


the big gun fall limp

and can not raise they weapon any high than degree



west and gordon banking around for another sortie

grant chuckle at the dauntless pair pluck

loveless think for a moment push grant out of the
way and roll over to the control
he push a lever
and the tarantula bend down on it knee
he bark to
Munitia

i be through with diplomacy
take
he away and kill he


on it front knee


now it rear end be tilted up in the air giving
amazonia at the Gatling gun a shot at



the the desert wasps wing and
through it
they be going down

what do you boy da vinci say
about puttin this bird down

i do not think he think it would
ever work so he do not get that
far
i be open to suggestion

gordon aim wasp at the tarantula kamikazelike just
as


Munitia cock back the hammer of she pistol and aim
it at the president

loveless at the control

Munitia
Munitia

and onto the low deck
they pick up the president
and dust he off

sorry about that sir

would suffice
loveless tap a button on he chair and the floor open
up beneath west

loveless sics amazonia on gordon and grant and proceed
down the ramp to the level below

Lippenreider take over the

he be just trying to get up when a cleated metal foot
stomp down with hundreds of foot pound per square inch
as west scream in pain


gordon try to come to wests aid but amazonia point
a gun barrel at he temple
gordon can only watch
helplessly as


loveless begin a metallicflamenco hand on he hip
he pistonlike leg kicking wests body and head

it feel so good to stretch i
leg



west can not take much more of this he be about to pass
out
loveless lower he alloy foot over wests head and
begin to crush it like a grape

i like to beat i foot on the
mississippi mud


gordon watch in a torture sweat as he partner try
to hold off the metal foot
but he be slowly losing
gordon turn to he female captor throw he arm out
beseechingly
when he do the derringer come snap
out of he sleeve in the device which normally hold his

why be it that i be unafraid
i believe you gentleman be the
polar opposite of a moral
dilemma and i be stick in the
middle
on one end we have
mr
west a man of primitive
vigours uncomplicated by
intellect
and on the other
there be mr
gordon
man of
idea but unlike myself lack
the passion to kill for they
he would like to be able to act his
way out of it
and for some
reason when he be actine someone
always seem to get killed
loveless put more pressure on wests head he groan
gordon aim

shoot he gordon

i be right about you be not i
gordon
and that be why i be
going to kill you friend here
then i be going to kill you

the startle loveless west and even gordon
but when loveless realize that he be not hit he laugh

after all that you missed

not exactly
he gesture down Lovelesss leg to a puncture metal
tube that be spraying a stream of hydraulic fluid all over
the deck rendering the foot on wests head powerless
west get out from under rub he neck to regain
circulation

gordon turn to see grant gesture at the horizon
he
eye widen when he see the flat mesa they be travelling
come to a sudden halt at a foot cliff

be
gordon frantically start pulling this lever and that
meanwhile



west approach loveless
there be going to be some
payback

for almost four long year i have
be trackin the animal
responsible for the massacre at
new liberty
and i hear that be you
but with the hydraulic fluid the fight have go out of
loveless

wicked witch
rev



whimper pathetically he uncouples he body from the
useless contraption and slowly back up to he wheelchair
that be stick against the railing

please west
show a little mercy
to a poor defenseless cripple

now now doctor
let we not cloud
this otherwise sunny day with that
poorolmecrippletalk
just

indefatigably hardpumpin and
steely

loveless get to he wheelchair and collapse in it

after i kill you i swear i be going to
boil you down to axle grease

now that be the ol doctor i know
but the smile fade from wests face when he see Lovelesss
shotgun armrest pop out leveled at he waist
west have nowhere to go but up as he leap to grab the
Ibeam over he head just as loveless pull the trigger
on both


the almost blow the heel off wests boot
they
a behind he
steam spew out
this be
going to have an effect on something


gordon and grant be trying different combination to
stop the thing
finally gordon throw up he hand
he do not know what else to try when suddenly the
tarantula seize up as if it just have a heart attack
and tilt forward


the tarantula lurch forward drastically and teeter
totter on the brink
rev



the sudden stop jerk loveless wheelchair free
despite he frantic effort he be rolling toward the
opposite railing
when the wheelchair hit a pool of
hydraulic fluid on the deck it spin he around
degree

under wests leg and then it slam into
the railing and wedge there


the impact make the mighty beast jerk forward inch
away from toppling over


the jolt shoot west off the girder
he freefalls
through the belly and out into the open air

hanging on by a thread
west reach out grab the
wheel of the chair and hang there

hatred i have for you

could kill you very easily just
by pulling this lever
he move the joystick
the chair jerk back

i guess the only thing
that i can take comfort in be the
hope that you would hit those
rock a second before i and i
could enjoy immeasurable bliss
before i vanish

back and forth
what to do what to do
west grab the joystick

allow i to make that decision
easy on you loveless
