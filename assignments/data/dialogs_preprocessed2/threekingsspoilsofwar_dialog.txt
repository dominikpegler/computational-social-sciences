i do not know and i be not about to mess
with it

should have blown already
delay fuse
that be vietnam stuff

maybe that be all the iraqi could afford
okay
maybe they get it on discount
maybe the fuse be messed up
or maybe
it be going to go off in two second and
we will not have to worry about get
jaeger down off there all we will have to
worry about be finding the piece

epps

do not matter
we be not going to be
able to get he off it anyway

there be a way

epps

can not do it
can not do it and keep he
alive

it fall asleep and you die so wake it
the hell up

how be this going to work

i and wes each go take an end of the
rope run we ass of and yank you off

i be going
to be okay

you be going to be fine

you be not going to let i die be you
do not let i die

when we start running suck up you
breath
you be going to get the wind
knock out of you

do not let i die epps
i do not want to
die

what if it be a Valloro
just going to
bounce right up out of the ground
explode in the air kill he and we

you just go when i say go

should have at least get the map off
of he
blow up with he then we do
all this for nothing

ready

yeah



oh god
oh god



i be all right
oh jesus i be all right

the map okay


how long we going to keep this up

until we be out of the mine field be how
long

have not find a mine for half a mile or more

that do not mean nothing
iraqi could
have just spread they out like that
make
we think we be in the clear

you want to crawl crawl

you be going to blow yourselves up

wes be right
if there be any more
mine we would have find they
hell
that one you stepped on be probably old
anyway
left over from the war with iran

you do not know that
it could be a trick

if we step on a mine we will know it be
let i see the map

get up and give i the map

we be on course
northeast twentyeight
degree
when we hit the base of the
mountain we will find a pass
i can see it
on the recon photo
should not be too
hard to traverse
Thatll take we to the
top and

this
whatever it be

it be the treasure that be what it be

it well be

the map

the map

you be not losing trust be you

just figure it be i map i ought to hang
on to it

if all we wanted be the map out of you
we could have taken it while you be
standing on that mine pissing on
yourself

probably would have too if epps be not
around to stop you

i do not have to stop anything because
nobody be going to do nothing
we be in
this together understand

yeah i understand
wes do not want to
come along in the first place but he
get a third of the find
that be a sweet
deal

i be get tire of you riding i
jaeger

anytime you want to do something about it
just let

quiet

i do not hear any

shut up and listen

gunfire

do not

it be a fire fight

single shot do not mean a fire fight
that be not a battle going on

what be it




what be it

iraqi
bunch of they

what be they do here

well it be iraq
i be not sure but i be
guessing that have something to do with
they be here

what be they do in the middle of
nowhere

maybe they be looking for gold



jesus
what the hell do he do that for
they be iraqi
why be iraqi killing
iraqi

those people down there be shiite
you have get shiite in the south of iraq
and Khurds in the north
neither of
they get much love for saddam
probably figure once the war start
there might be an uprising so he send
he soldier out to slap they around some

they be do more than slapping

the shiite be on we side
i do not
know that

be there anything you do know

i know you be a pussy
i know that

all right
let we get out of here

the soldier be going to kill those
people

so

we have to do something

there be nothing we can do

we can fight
that be what we be here
for
to fight the iraqi
to help the
shiite and the Khurds

i do not sign up to help any shiite
all we be suppose to do be get the
iraqi out of kuwait and if we be not
do that then all bet be off

we carrying any ordinance

some extra grenade
claymore

not enough
we be out numbered and out
gun
they would cut we to shred

so good bye shiite
thanks for
playing
we have some lovely part
gift for you as you go

we be american soldier
we do not
abandon people

funny you should say that while we be out
looking for gold

you be the one wanted to kill iraqi so
bad

i have get a new agenda now it be get rich
the only way the iraqi figure into that
be not at all

i do not want to see people killed any
more than you
but we try to help out we
die and all we do be die

we can not just go off and

there be nothing we can do
we should not
even be here in the first place


this be it
we be right on target

all we have get to do be make it to the
top

and find the treasure and get it and
get back to the Humvee and get the hell
out of iraqi without get we head
blown off but that be about it

we be not going to find anything standing
here
let we get to climb




not much of a pass

probably be a couple of hundred year
ago when whoever draw the map come
through here
wear down to nothing now

pick up again just on the other side

think we can make it

we make it or we go back empty hand

look like we make it



the army
always an adventure

let i see the map

should be easy going from here
stay on
the pass straight to the dot

what do you figure it to be

get to be some kind of landmark
something distinctive

mark the spot

something like that

but the white dot in the middle
that be
get to mean something

i hope it mean something otherwise

otherwise whatever we be looking for
could be anywhere

basically
but the map have be pretty
precise so far
i do not think it will be
too hard to

take cover

let we hit they

cover i

clear

where do they go

i do not know
there be a lot of space up
here
they could be just about

weird they do not chase we

maybe they be as scare of we as we be
of they

just seem weird they do not chase we

what be weird be how they disappeared
do not make sense
do not

scatter

where be it
where do it go

stay low

where the hell be it

just stay down

what be we going to do
what the hell
be we going to do

we be not going to do anything

they be going to kill we

they can not shoot we in here

and they can not fly around out there
forever

so we wait

if they land

if they land we can take they
if they
do not land then we have get nothing to
worry about

missile

move

epps

they want we to surrender

yeah i will surrender

get down

oh god

yeah
just keep get good and
well do not it



what do you think

line up with the map and the photo

we be right where we should be

i sure do not see much place else around
here to hide anything

can not see anything

it be get a bottom

guess we know what the next stop be

all right
let we break out some utility
shovel lantern and a claymore in case
we have to do any blast
i and
Jaegerll climb down and see what we can
see

what be i suppose to do

get to have someone here in case we need
help making it back up
do not hurt to
have a look out either

think there might be more iraqi

right now i would not be surprise if
eartha kitt show up singing send in the
clown



you down

yeah we be down

what do you see

nothing

whole lot of nothing

so where do we start

wherever you want






hey
hey
sun going down
epps
jaeger
it be get dark up here




epps

i hear


there be nothing down there


what be you do

what do it look like i be do

it look like you be not do anything

i be not
and i be not do anything
because there be nothing down here

get up and dig

we have be digging
we have be digging
for hour
if there be anything here to
find we would have find it

get up off you ass and dig

what be the point
there be nothing here
the map a fake
christ even i see
that now
we be just wasting we time
we might as well give up and

you listen to i
the whole reason we be
here be because of you and that map of
yours
i do not do all this for nothing
and i be not leaving with nothing
if you
think for a second i be giving up just
because you be too tire to turn over some
dirt then you do not know john epps too
well do you
so you dig and you keep
on digging til i say you do not have to
dig anymore


what be you do
what the hell be
you do down there


must be a compartment

i feel air
probably open up outside
somewhere
that be where the light come
from
could not see it with the lanternon

the white dot
light in the dark

maybe we should blast it loose with the
claymore

it be giving

jesus christ

no do not shoot

it be just a mongoose

be it dead

yeah bwana you get it


what the hell be you do


i think we find something


what be it
Whatd you find


gold
it be gold

it be


gold


it be not like i figure
it be cold
and
it be heavy than i imagined

i would not know
i never imagined this
not in i whole life do i ever imagine
this

you do not have to imagine it
not
anymore
now all you have get to think up
be what it be going to buy you

wes



we throw down a pack

i do not think the line will take the
weight of a man and the coin
yell up

wes
we will send the gold up then i
and Jaegerll climb back



ready when you be

wait

what

what

we send the gold up what be to stop he
from taking off and leaving we down here

he be not going to leave we

what be to stop he if he wanted to
all
he have to do be cut the line

you ready

all right
i will go up then you send up
the gold and

why do i have to stay down here

jesus jaeger

i do not see how that plane any good

Someones get to send the gold up
it
can not get on the line by itself

why be it get to be i

what be you do
you ready

all right
you go up i will send up the
gold then follow

yeah
yeah that work

if you be even think about leaving i
down here you well think again

we i be coming up

okay

wes
jaeger

jaeger

jaeger


what the hell take so long

just have to get the pack unhook from
the line
it do not seem that long

not when you be up here with the gold i
guess not

not losing trust be you

it will be too dark to make we way back
now
let we bed down for the night and
head out at first light

what about the gold

what about it

maybe we should split it up now

we start this together and we be
staying together so there be no point in
split thing up now

what if we get separated
way i see it
if something happen i want to be
carrying i share

wes might be right about that

it stay as it be
we be halfway home
now
let we not blow it by people get
idea

you be the one with all the idea

you have have you say wes
now leave it

maybe you have get idea of you own for
the gold
maybe you have already get
thing worked out

maybe i do

maybe i do not need you idea
maybe i
can do well on i own

you get no reason to do that

i told you
when i straighten someone
out they stay straighten
this be how
it work
nobody touch the gold
except when we be on the move and
someone carrying it nobody so much as
open the pack to get an eyeful of it
agreed

yeah
sure
that sound like a plan to
i

you get no reason to hit i
i be get
tire of you and jaeger pushing i around

then get up and do something about it

then just lay there and bleed



stay down
stay the hell down or i will
rip you stink head off

what the hell

i caught he
i caught he trying to
steal the gold

get off he

he snuck in here think we be asleep
only i be not sleep
would have slit
we throat if i have not stopped he

get off he

what happen

i told you

i told you

tell i what he be saying

say he be one of the soldier that be in
the helicopter

he live through that

say they be deserter they be
afraid to fight do not believe in saddam
anyway
they fly the gunship up here to
hide out
when they see we they figure
we be going to kill they so they shoot
first

Whyd he come in we camp

say he wanted food
liar
he wanted
the gold

how be he going to want the gold
he
could not even know we have it

he
he could have be watch we

maybe we should give he some water

all last night he could have be

i think he want something to drink

i be not wasting i water on he

i do not care what he say he wanted we
gold
would have slit we throat if he
have the chance

do not matter
whatever he wanted he
do not get it
we have get no need staying
around here
it be light enough
let we
pack up and head out

what about he
we
we have to do
something

we can not just leave he
he will run back
to he outfit report we position

you said he be a deserter

that be what he say
he could be a spy
or something

you do not know that

you do not know he be not

so we will take he with we
at least til
we get back to the hummer

he would just slow we down and drink we
water
and if we run into any more
iraqi you know he would sell we out

we do not leave he we do not take he
with we
what do that leave

you be out of you mind

he be an enemy soldier

i be not going to let you kill he

we be at war

we be not at war
you and i and jaeger
be
we have no authority

he tried to kill we
if not just now
then in the helicopter
that be all the
authority i need

we do not need to do this
we get the
gold all right
let we just get out of
here

i be not going to leave he be just so he
can stab we in the back the minute we
turn around
i have be through too
much to lose it all now just because the
two of you do not have the stomach to do
what have to be do

i have get no stomach for murder

it be a combat action

it be murder and i will not be any part of
it

then step aside

no

get out of i way

for christs sake we do not need this
let we just go
let we just
let we just
get out of here

shut up
shut the hell up

he be get away



i have to
you see how he run
would
have given we away
i have to

maybe we ought to
you know bury he
say some word over he

you want to say some word

go to hell
how be those word


we should head northeast

northeast
that be away from the hummer
**further/far into iraqi

there be another pass on the photo
we
can avoid that narrow one we have to cross
on the way up and it should get we back
down

it should or it will
least going back
the way we come we know what we be up
against

you think you can make that pass weight
down when you almost fell the first time
you be wrong and you be not going to
take i share of the gold with you trying
it
we be heading northeast

you have get an awful lot of order in you
always giving order

i out rank you that be why

in the service you do but we be not
particularly in the service right now
way i see it what we be do that
do not particularly give you the right
to toss order around

we be down this road
i told you how
it be
unless you feel like there be
something you want to do about it

what if i do

what if i do

you talk loud and do not even have a big
stick to back it up with

something happen to i i let go of this
grenade
i go and i take the navicom
with i
and how do you suppose you be
going to find you way back to the hummer
when you will not even know what be up or
down
it be a big country and you could
be heading for the ally or wandering
right into Bhagdad
that be if you do not
die of thirst before you even get that
far
how you like i stick now

why do not you put the gun down all
right wes
you put the gun down and
Eppsll put the pin back in the grenade
will not you epps

i be starting to think you be a real
bitch you know that


you be going to burn up in those

the white reflect the sun
it keep you
cooler
that be why they wear they

think the iraqi killed they all

probably shoot a few
scatter the rest
murderer

murder or a combat action
it be hard to
tell they apart

you see how he run do not you
first
chance he get he run out
would have
go straight to he told he all
about the gold
what do you think would
have happen then huh
then what do
you think would have happen
two
thousand scream iraqi bearing down on
we
you ought to thank i for kill
he
i will get a medal for it
watch and
see if i do not get a medal

what the hell

help
help i

help i

for christs sake jaeger
help i
help i

wes
wes

the navicom

what be we going to do
how be we
going to find we way back

we will find we way

how

we will find we way
we will

no navicom
lot of good you be now
epps

lot of good you be when i be sink
in the sand

without that navicam look to i like you
forfeit the right to be in charge

and let i guess who be

i be the one get the big stick

suppose i do not go for that

then i suppose it would be insurrection and
i suppose i would have to kill you
i suppose

what about jaeger

nothing about he unless he be get a
problem about i dealing with you

yeah i get a problem with you killing epps

i mean in principle

sneer
you know jaeger you really be a bitch

you die

we get to go back
we get to go back for
wes

forget wes

we can not just leave he

wes be dead

what if he be not

then he will be when those iraqi get to
he
he be going to kill you
he be
one blink away from it
he be dead epps
and i be sure as hell not get i head
blow off over he carcass

it be a helicopter

there

ours or theirs

ours or theirs

ours
it be one of ours
we have get to
signal they
let they know we be down
here

no

we need something
flare a signal
mirror

no

what do you mean no
they can fly we home

they will ask question
want to know why
we be out here

we will lie

they will search the pack

they will find the gold

we be lose you understand that
we have
get no navicom and no means to find a
way back
so right now i do not give a
damn about the gold because if we do not
get off this desert and out of iraqi all
it be going to be good for be buying we
tombstone

i can not do it epps
not when we be so
close
i can not let you ruin everything

first wes now you

i be not like wes
wes be crazy

and you
you have get it all together

i do not want it this way
i would not
kill you just to kill you but i can not
let you lose the gold for i
not when
we be so close

that helicopter pass and the only
thing we be close to be death

sit down epps

i be sorry about that epp

be it all right if i stand up

oh yeah
go ahead

i be glad i do not have to kill you
i be
glad it do not come to that

yeah
well i too

i never killed anybody before
i talk a
good game but i be not like that

sure

really i be not
remember how i be
talking i wanted to blow away all those
iraqi
that be all it be be talk
i
be scared out of i mind to go to war
i still have not get over step on
that land mine

you still get a map on you

what
yeah

epps

yeah

i do not want to die

make two of we

i know what i do just now be crazy but
you get to understand how much i want
that gold

it be all right
i do not like it but
it be over now

i never have anything before epps
i
never be anybody
not the kind of
somebody you can be with a pocket full of
gold coin
when i be in high school i
used to

hey you know what
can i be honest with
you
right now i be not all that
interest in how you be messed up because
you do not get the bicycle you wanted for
you thirteenth birthday
what i be
interest in be how i can keep from
get dead
and listening to sob
story from some about how the
system be not good to he because he have
to work like everybody else instead of
be born a kennedy do not do a damn
thing to help keep i alive
so do i a
favor
either shut up or
just shut up

sorry

damn

what do you think we chance be

if we can find the hummer or some
friendly by sundown we might be okay
we have get enough water for that
but we
will not make another day otherwise

wonder how the ware going

it be get to be going good than this

all right
pick a direction

we can not just sit here
we have get to
start moving so pick

you sure you want i too

i pick that way

okay
then we go this way




get cold

it be a desert
that be what desert do at
night
they get cold

epps
epps
i be going to stop for a
second

no

just let i rest for a second

we have get to keep moving while there be
still light

you know what i be going to do
i be just
going to take a second
i want to look
at the gold

do not you touch it

i just want to look at it
remind i of
what i be dying for

the deal be no one touch it until we
get out of here

yeah but we make that deal while wes be
still alive
he be go
time for a new
deal

you listen to i
if
if
we get out of
this i do not care what you do with you
share but until then you have only get one
thing to think about and that be staying
alive
so you leave that gold alone or
you and i be going to have to have a
serious talk

look

what do you figure it be

place all alone like that
must be a
boarder check point

which boarder
saudi
kuwait
syria

could not be syria
we could not have go
that far north
it be get to be saudi
come on

they have get to have water
we will get
same water some direction maybe they
even have a vehicle

epps

we can head back for we line and they
do not even have to know about the gold

epps
what if they be not saudi

if it be a checkpoint it could be iraqi

we have get no cboice
either way we have
get no choice

well

well we should identify ourselves

yeah i guess we should

even if they be iraqi probably all
they will do be take we prisoner for
awhile
get to figure we be still
kicking they ass in the war
they
do not want any trouble

hell they will probably just surrender to
we
probably

that be if the war be even still going on
way thing be shaping up it be probably
long over

probably

Hellooooo

checkpoint
oh sweet jesus

they could not tell
in the dark

what be we going to do

because you have get four of they to take down

can not you

i do not have a weapon

do not go bitch on i now
you be going
to kill i
kill they

i just said i would
i do not think i

shoot they

shoot they jaeger


let we get some sleep



epp
epps
there be someone at the
window

an iraqi

i do not know
he do not have a uniform
on
he
he have on white robe like the
guy who killed wes

see anything

nothing

what do we do

we can not stay here
even if that be not
an iraqi soldier it be only a matter of
time before some show up
get all the
water you can carry and we will head out
on foot

to where

sun rise in the east
we go the
opposite direction
may not find
anything but at least we will know we be
heading towards saudi arabia

ready

look

what do we do

we keep going that be what we do
we
ignore they maybe they ignore we

jesus
how many of they be there

i do not like this
let we go


what do you make of they

shiite i think

be that good or bad

i do not know
they killed wes

why have not they killed we

i do not know

maybe
maybe we can fight we way
out

with what
against how many

we can not just sit here waiting to die

you come up with a good plan let i
know

maybe
maybe if we trade they the gold
if we give it to they they might let we
live
they might not kill we



i always know you be a bitch

wes

you be shoot
we be standing right
there you be shoot

in the flack jacket
still like get
hit in the back with a baseball bat
take the air right out of i but i be
just unconscious for awhile
course
you do not stick around to find that out
you left i for dead

we think



when i shiite friend see that they have
shoot an american they be very
apologetic
turn out we have be kicking
ass in this little war
they figure
we have finally get saddam off they
back
they bring i to they camp
clean i up feed i
i be they new
good buddy
america number one joe
but there be something the shiite can not
figure out
they can not figure out why i
two buddy two fellow american left
i out in the desert
they can not seem to
figure out what those same two guy be
do in an iraqi outpost
it be almost
as if they be iraqi spy or
something
and i have get to tell you they
hate anything that be get to do with the
iraqi
see how i mean

we have to take shelter in the checkpoint
jesus wes i killed the iraqi in there

you actually get around to kill
someone
i be impress
i guess you be
only half a bitch

wes we think you be dead and we
think we be next
hanging around to
get killed would not have do anyone any
good

sure and i guess it be just convenient
there be one less person to split the
gold with

wes

look i know you guy be telling the
truth
it be just the shiite do not know
that
i guess you could tell they
but
then you do not speak the language do you

do you

they be going to kill you slow
i will see
to that

thanks for taking care of this for i

tell i something we
be you crazy
greedy or just stupid
jaeger say
you be crazy

i do not say that
i never said

i
i say you do not have enough brain
to be stupid

you disappoint i epps
always figure
you to be a man
a real bright guy
i
have respect for you

that why you tried to put a bullet in i
head in the middle of the desert

i expect more
from you you know

now let we try thing another way
let we
try this
you and i and jaeger be
going to walk out of here
we be going
to walk out all smile and friendly so
you little shiite buddy will not suspect
a thing
then we be going to hop on some
horse and ride away and live happily
ever after
it be all going to happen
just like that because if it do not
then i be going to gut you like a fat pig
you understand i
soldier

i will take that as a yes

they will kill you
you will not make it ten
foot before they cut you down

you do not know john epps very well do
you

to start

do not say anything

just keep quiet

i have to answer he

so you can give we away

if i do not answer he will know something
up

you answer he but you answer he wrong
and you be going to be stare at you
inside while you be dying

for old time
sake

look like at the end of the day we
finally find out who be good than who
do not we epps
like i said
i expect
more from you

it be like i said
you do not really know
lieutenant john epps very well do you

damn it
we lost the horse

the
the gold

it be not the gold
it be the claymore
mine
the gold in i pack

when do you make the switch

it be always be like that
when you
left i down in the crevice to send the
gold up i figure i would well
take
precaution
i rig it to blow if
anyone opened the pack
just in case
somebody think they could do well on
they own

but

we have a deal
no one touch the gold
until we be out of here
no one break
the deal no one have anything to worry
about

what if it have not be wes
what if
i
mean accidently what if i have

you should not think about thing like
that
it will just make you crazy



well

care get to come along sooner or
later
when it do we jack it

how do we do that

you lie in the middle of the road look
like you be hurt
when the car stop i
run over to the driver and put a gun to
he head

what if the car
do not stop

i just
think it be a hell of a man who can keep
from going money simple

reason i have not figure a way to get all
that money for myself be because i have
be too busy figure way to stay

the member of this tribunal have reach
a verdict
base on the evidence
present we find the defend guilty as
charged of desertion insurrection
insubordination and conduct unbecoming
further/far the tribunal will recommend that
the defendant be sentence to life
imprisonment and that from this day
forward he shall no long walk as a free
man
you should consider yourself quite
fortunate son
there be a time when
lesser crime would have find you before
a fire squad
i do not know that a
person like you have much to say for
himself but it be you right say
something

i be sorry i guess
not for looking for
the gold or leaving i post
you know
what it be like to have gold rain out
of you hand
Thatll give i enough to
think about the rest of i day in the
brig
i be just sorry about wes
he be
all right
it be the gold that make he
what he become
if i have not find that
map if i have not talk they into going
searching
wes just might have make it
home after all
i guess i feel
responsible for he

the way i view thing you be responsible
for the live of two man
private first
class wes Hanmond and second lieutenant
john epps

yeah well i have be think about
that
see there be an explosion and
everything but i never really aaw epp
get killed
and nobody ever find the
gold
i guess they both could have be
burned to slag
i guess
but there be
a lot of body out on that road

smart man could have find some
identification to use
smart man could
have make he way up to syria or turkey
smart man could have get himself
right out of the middle east
smart
man with enough gold
way i figure
right about now old epps be sitting in a
bar in sydney or Melboure or maybe
brisbane telling story to one of the
pretty aussie you ever see

i find it highly unlikely that anyone
could accomplish such a thing

well sir i guess you do not know second
lieutenant john epps very well do you
