the swirl around finn wound but as the
branch keep the wound open they cannot heal
ravenna sit at she desk she be small and alone in the
vastness of the hall
she stare off into space a quill in she hand parchment laid
out before she
then suddenly she body convulses the bottle of black ink
spill dark tendril of liquid seep across the paper and onto
the floor

finn

she fight hard at first but then begin to weaken she
power fade as she age
then she stop

we pull away from she
Ravennas head be down deplete forlorn
completely still
ink pool around she bony hand
but when she raise she head

what we promised



















snow white eye open gazing up at the ceiling she
thought far away
there be a strange calm about she now a
quiet acceptance as if she know what she must do










at the top of the stairs that lead down into the courtyard














































































eric and william fight like demon twice as fast twice as








a

a
eric william and a dozen man rush in
ravenna smile raise she hand

i will show you thorn
in a terrifying tremor the black ceiling of the throne room
start to shatter into millions of shard









enraged snow white jolt she body and free herself from



























on she face
the cloud move in the disc of light above snow
white
the light fall over Ravennas face
the light fade out of she eye and she die
in the cloister garden a blossom flower on the apple tree and
the world be born again



in death Ravennas beautiful blue eye be wide open fixed on
the halo of light that surround snow white head




backlit in a golden hue
crown be place on she head
we be in
