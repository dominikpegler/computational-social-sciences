i believe in the church of baseball
i have tried all the major religion
and most of the minor one i have
worshipped buddha allah brahma
vishnu shiva tree mushroom and
isadora duncan



i know thing
for instance
there be bead in a catholic
rosary
and
there be stitch in a baseball
when i learned that i give jesus a
chance
but it just do not work out between
we
the lord laid too much guilt on
i
i prefer metaphysic to theology
you see there be no guilt in
baseball
and it be never bore

which make it like sex
there be never be a ballplayer sleep
with i who do not have the good
year of he career
making love be like hitting a baseball
you just get to relax and concentrate

besides i would never sleep with a player
hitting under
unless he have a
lot of

i
s or be a great glove
man up the middle
woman get to have standard

the young player start off full of
enthusiasm and energy but they do not
realize that come july and august
when the weather be hot it be hard to
perform at you peak level
the veteran pace themselves well
they finish strong
they be great
in september
while i do not believe a woman need
a man to be fulfilled i do confess
an interest in finding the ultimate
guy he would have that youthful
exuberance but the veteran sense
of time

see there be a certain amount of
lifewisdom i give these boy
i can expand they mind
sometimes
when i have get a ballplayer alone
i will just read emily dickinson or
walt whitman to he
the guy be so
sweet they always stay and listen
of course a guy will listen to
anything if he think it be foreplay

i make then feel confident
they
make i feel safe
and pretty

what i give they last a lifetime
what they give i last game
sometimes it seem like a bad trade
but bad trade be part of baseball
who can forget frank robinson or
milt pappas for Godsakes
it be a long season and you get to
trust it


i have tried they all i really have
and the only church that truly feed
the soul day in day out be
the church of baseball

christian ethics i be within the
framework of a baseball season
monogamous

guy like i because it might be real
so you sabotage it with some bullshit
about commitment to a young boy you

sisyphus as manifest in a minor league
losing streak joe and i think

the infield you lollygag you be way
to first you lollygag in an outta
the dugout
you know what that make
ya
Lollygaggers
what be we record
larry

we be eight and sixteen

eight and sixteen
how do we ever
win eight
jose what be this sign

that be the steal

wrong
that be the bunt
this be the
steal

face be skin to skin
skin start
with
stand for steal if it
follow the indicator which be hand
to eye because the word indicator
start with an i so i figure eye
would remind you of i for
indicator to indicate that what
follow be the sign
i figure wrong
you be a buncha lollygaggers
this be a simple game
you throw the ball you hit the ball
you catch the ball


bobby go hitless again
he be going to
be in a terrible mood
terrible
how do mickey do

he get two hit

lucky you


we can not win at home how we going to
win on the road
we get a twelve day
road trip starting tomorrow
bus leaf at six in the morning


you wanted to see i

yeah bobby shut the door
this be the tough job a manager
have
but the organization have decided to
make a change

skip i know i be in a slump but i
hit the ball hard tonight right at
they
couple flare drop in and
i be back in the groove


there be daddy
wave to daddy

oh god


i want you to wear these on the road
trip when you pitch

what

they will fit snugly against you ball
in such a wonderful way that you will
start seeing thing differently
plus they will remind you of i which
be good than think about those
nasty hitter

jesus annie i do not know

you have be pitch out of the wrong
side of you brain
Thesell help
move thing to the right side

big league pitcher do not use these

they do when they be in the
carolina league




woman should never ask question
about road trip


man do not realize that woman always
know when they have be unfaithful
the fact be upon exact moment of
penetration the woman know


this sort of spiritual awareness can
be a mixed bless especially if
you be dating a ballplayer
i believe
a woman oughta take care of she man
so thoroughly that he can go on the
road for a few day without have
the desire to search out another
pair of panty
that be probably however i most
ridiculous belief
i just hope the boy start winning
soon
in some profound way i fear
that a last place team be a reflection
on it woman


i get one word to say to you shut
up

oh she may get wooly woman do get
wooly because of all the stress

give i that

i hate people who get the word wrong
it be not woolly it be weary and
it nobody get stress they be
wearing a dress
listen

oh she may be weary young girl do
get weary wear the same old
dress

how come you do not like i

because you do not respect yourself
which be you problem but you do not
respect the game and that be i
problem
you get a gift

what do i get

gift
when you be a baby the
god reach down and turned you
leave arm into a thunderbolt

you get a hall of fame arm but you be
pissing it away

i be not pissing nothing away i
get a porsche already
with


and a quadraphonic Blaupunkt

you do not need a quadraphonic
Blaupunkt you need a curve ball
in the show everybody can hit the
fastball

Ebby calvin nuke LaLoosh




nuke be so encourage that he take
a vow to not have sex until they
lost



see a ballplayer on a streak
consider himself touched with magic
and he will do anything to keep from
breaking the spell




in fact the whole team start making
religious connection and everybody
get hot




i figure nuke would win a couple
then lose and thing would get back
to normal



but it do not happen like that
and for one extraordinary june and
july the durham bull for whatever
perverse reason begin playing
baseball with joy and verve and poetry



the two side of i own brain be
all jumble up and crosswired
while one side be be neglected
the other be in paradise watch
we bull play like big leaguer



we swept a four game series with
kingston back to back doubleheaders
with WinstonSalem and kick the
holy shit out of greensboro in a
three game series



they be in demand all over town
and crash who keep hitting dingers
be approaching the minor league
record

they might need a catcher to finish
out the season







the house smell like sex for day

mon meat throw i that weak ass
shit mon bring the heat bring
it bring it




i be reading in bed when crash hit
he th home run
i know the moment
it happen


get you ass in gear




i light a candle for Crashs dinger
and tried to root the durham bull
home to a pennant




the kid from Lynchburg be not good
enough to hold Crashs jockstrap if
you ask i and nukes replacement
have a fastball that i coulda hit
we have a three game lead with two
week to go when the rain come



it rain and rain and i think
of driving down to asheville to see
crash but then i think no what
you pursue elude you
i have to
trust quantum physics and the church
of baseball
it be not always easy be this
religious



oh i

what happen

i quit
hit i dinger and hung they
up

i be quit too
boy not baseball

there might be an open for a
manager at salem next spring

salem massachusetts
where all the
witch be

yeah
you a witch

not yet
it take year of practice

you think i could make it to the
show as a manager

you would be great just great
because you understand nonlinear
think even though it seem like
baseball be a linear game because of
the line and the box score an
all but the fact be that there be
a spaciousnontime kind of time
to it

annie

what

i get a lotta time to hear you
theory and i wanta hear every damn
one of they
but right now i be tire
and i do not wanta think about baseball
and i do not wanta think about quantum
physics
i do not wanta think about
nothing
i just wanta be

i can do that too


walt whitman once said i see
great thing in baseball
it be we
game the american game
he said it will repair we loss
and be a bless to we
you could look it up
