cheers

i be
talking to chris marlow the
barrister who represent
decorate afghanistan para
veteran shona barnes early
this year
if you recall shona
be sentence to seven year
in wormwood scrub for the
murder of caleb round the
man who broke into she house
shot and held she hostage for
several hour on the night of
march the twelfth last year
chris so


in you
opinion Shonas PostTraumatic
stress disorder a condition
she suffer follow action


an incident with an in
Helmand province in afghanistan
in may two thousand and ten
an incident that killed a
close colleague of hers and
result in shona be
pension invalide out of
the army
in you opinion chris
this the should have
be crucial to the decision
not to prosecute shona for
murder a charge you now feel
should have be reduced to
what
manslaughter
she do not
seem like much of an invalid
in the way she deal with round
do she
so for you be this
a travesty of justice
really

i sense of it be christie
as i have say and the reason i
feel i failed really be that
the state must find a way
to take responsibility

but now you be consider
retire
with a future as
certain
law lord perhaps
you be regarded by many as a
legal wunderkind

well i do not know about that
but yes i be looking to move
out of the legal profession now

because of this case specifically
as queens council you could help
people like shona
lots of Shonas

i know
but look
for i it be
this
we send she out to
afghanistan
we tell she to kill
people who resist we invasion
but
anyway look
we make she
an expert
kill machine
and then war break we machine
so then we machine need
PostTraumatic stress disorder
drug in order to function in
normal life
to make a cup of
tea for god sake
silence a
beat then she be a break
child chrissie
we broke she
so then when she kill a known
psychotic child molester and
murderer in she home in the
middle of the night in she
home in selfdefence we
the state we call that murder
and we throw she to the dog
we
screw she up in the name of a
because in some country some
people and let we face it
in a part of the world not
many british people know or
give a damn about and then we
finish the job
we prosecute she
for murder and lock she up

but ultimately the only
alternative be that we do not
have a professional a stand
army
we rely on



i understand
i understand
that when you sign up you
take you chance
you become
an organ of the state and if
that state tell you to kill
people in it name it choose
not to call that murder
it
choose then to call you a
hero especially if you die

so these young people the
soldier who give they live
in the defence of we liberty
do not deserve the label hero
be that what you be saying

nation state have always
protected themselves from they
own imperial absurdity
what
would be left if there be no
chance of glory
why would anyone
sign up
look
in war anywhere
people do what they can to
survive
all i can say be that
personally i mean as Shonas
brief i failed to make the court
see sense
for i you know it be
like you can murder in the so
called defence of the state but
if you kill in the defence of
yourself


you know it be
like i mean as shakespeare
said if his because be wrong
we obedience to the king
wipe the crime of it out of we
