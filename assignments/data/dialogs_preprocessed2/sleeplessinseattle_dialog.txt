dad you be not taking this
seriously

this be not how you do it
refer to the
hamburger
you want this on an english
muffin or a bun

english muffin
how do you do
it

you see someone you like you
get a feel about they you
ask they if they want to have a
drink or

a slice of pizza

but not dinner necessarily on
the first date because by the
time you be halfway through
dinner you might be sorry you
ask they to dinner whereas if
it be just a drink if you like
they you can always ask they
for dinner but if you do not you
can go home if you see what i
mean
i wonder if it still work this
way

it do not
they ask you

i be starting to notice that



if you get a new wife i guess
you will have sex with she huh



what do you think



will she scratch up you back



what

in the movie woman be always
scratching up guy back and
screaming and stuff
when
they be have sex

whose show be this on

Jeds get cable

go to sleep

kiss howard
he hold out the
teddy bear
night howard




up next you and you
emotion with dr
marcia
Fieldstone clinical
psychologist and the good
friend you never have



he say he do not love i any
more




why do you want to be with
someone who do not love you



every time i come close to
orgasm he stop and go to
make himself a sandwich




why do not you make he a
sandwich beforehand



when i meet i wife it be so
clear
i jus know




what be it that make you know



i do not think i could really
describe it




why not



and if i could describe it it
probably would not be on a radio
show
but what the hell
it be not
one specific thing
it be more
of a feel
you touch she for the first
time and suddenly
you be
home
it be almost like
magic



we will be back after this
commercial with dr
marcia
Fieldstone

i think i be going crazy tom
i really do
be you happily
marry

completely panick by
the question
what

i mean why do you get
marry
be it all firework
and trumpet and

i get marry because betsy
said we have to break up or get
marry
so we get marry

but when you meet she do you
believe she be the only person
for you
that in some mystical
cosmic way it be fate

annie when you meet someone
and you be attracted to they
it just mean that you
subconscious be attracted to
they subconscious
subconsciously
so what we
think of as chemistry be just
two neurosis knowing that they
be a perfect match

i do not even know he
but
i be have all these fantasy
about a man i have never meet
who life in seattle

it rain nine month of the
year in seattle

i know i know
i do not want
to move to seattle
but what i
really do not want to do be end
up always wonder what might
have happen and knowing i
could have do something
what do you think
tom open he mouth to
say something but
before anything come
out annie fill the
void
it be just cold foot be not it
everyone panic before they get
married do not you

she
toss she hair a lot
why
do she do this
i have no
idea
be it a twitch
do
she need a haircut
should she
use barrette so it do not
keep falling in she face
these be thing that i be
will to get to the bottom
of and that be why i be dating
she
that be all i be do
i be not marry she
can you
appreciate the difference
that be what single people do
they try people on and they see
if they fit
but nobody fit
perfectly everyone be an
adjustment

be mom an adjustment

i be never going to meet anyone
who be going to measure up to
you mom in you eye
what do
you think
there be a perfect
woman walking around out there

there be no such thing as a
perf

to himself refer
to annie
god she be beautiful

unaware he be talking
about annie
victoria
she be okay

dad i be talking to jessica
about reincarnation and she
think that probably you know
annie in another life

who be annie

but jessica say you and annie
never get together in that
life and you heart be like
puzzle with part out of they
and when you get together the
puzzle complete

cosmic force

i sincerely hope you be not
going to marry jessica
