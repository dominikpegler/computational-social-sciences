the only question that still remain
how big will he landslide be
and how
extensive how sweep will the
modernisation programme be that he
usher in


hmm

i rather envy you be able to vote
not the actual tick of the box

he be
marry to a woman with known anti
monarchist sympathy you may
remember she curtsey the first time

shallow

i do not measure the depth of a
curtsey robin
i leave that to i
sister

and i speak to the cabinet secretary
who said he be expect the
atmosphere at downing street to be
very informal
everyone on first name

first be winston churchill
he sit in
you chair in frock coat and top hat
and be kind enough to give a shy

young girl like i quite an education

i can imagine

ith time one have hopefully added
experience to that education and a
little wisdom well enabling we to
execute we constitutional
responsibility
to advise guide and warn the
government of the day

advice which i look forward to
receiving

ell we will save that for we weekly
meeting
a beat
now if there be nothing else i
believe we have some business to
attend to

of course


you majesty the country have
spoken
and i come now to ask you
permiss

it be usual for to ask
the question
wince

to be they leader
and so the duty
fall on i as you sovereign to ask
you to become prime minister and form
a government in i name

i do not want the boy to see the news

Yees

you sister called about an hour ago
from tuscany

hope you told she to come back
cut
the holiday short

i do

anet imagine she be please

that be putting it mildly

what do she say

something about diana managing to be
even more annoy dead than alive

just make sure the boy never hear you
talk like that

of course

something to help you go down

no
i be going to do i diary a little
longer

fine
i will sleep next door

victorian redbrick house
in the driveway the
be not wearing he newcastle shirt


that be how she will remain
in we
mind we heart forever

get it

where will you do it

i think at church
on the way in


this be not a time for
recrimination however i would say
that i always believe that the press
would kill she in the end


but even i could not imagine that they
would take such a direct hand in she
death as seem to be the case
it
would appear that every proprietor and
editor of every publication that have
paid for intrusive and exploitative
photograph of she have blood on his
hand today

not the press mate
you have get the
wrong villain

i have get to go

you about to speak to the queen

yes

ask she if grease the brake

now now


he and the sit in silence
hey set CHARLESs place and he breakfast nut grain



i be sorry to disturb madam but i have
the prime minister for you
from he
constituency

privately roll eye
without looking up from
newspaper
lucky you

thank you robin
i will take it next
door
he get to she foot and walk out into

good morning prime minister

good morning you majesty
may i say
right away how very sorry i be and
that the thought and prayer of i
family be with you at this terrible
time and with the two prince in
particular


thank you
appear in the doorway

be it you intention to make some kind
of appearance
or statement

certainly not

no member of the royal family will
speak publicly about this
it be a
private matter and we would all
appreciate it if it could be respected
as such

i see

i do not suppose anyone have have time to
think about the funeral yet

we have spoken to the spencer family
and it be they wish
they express wish that it should
be a private funeral
with a memorial
service to follow in a month or so

right

given that diana be no long a
member of the royal family we have no
choice but to respect they wish

i see
shoot a look at


you do not feel that in view of she
high profile and popularity

choosing he word
carefully
it might be an idea to pay tribute
to she life and achievement
or even just to she as a mother

as i said
that be the spencers wish

and the public madam
the british
people

you do not think a private funeral
would be deny they a chance

hance to what

to share in the grief

it be a family funeral mr
blair
not
a fairground attraction
i think the princess have already paid
a high enough price for exposure to
the press do not you

now if there be nothing else i must
get on
the child have to be look
after

of course

good bye you majesty


she instinct be to do nothing
say
nothing
and give she a private
funeral

be you surprise
she hated she guts

well i think it be a mistake

they screw up she life
let we hope
they do not screw up she death
veryone be get ready to go to church
the and

the chaplain called
want to know
whether he should make any change to
the service or make special mention of
diana

what do you say

i told he he should not change a
thing


uite right

i think the less fuss one make or
draw attention to it the good
she lower she voice as
the approach from
the saloon with
for the boy

yes

and we should probably arrange some
company for they
some young people


i will take they for a long walk this
afternoon
up craggy head

good
they would like that
open the door

but no gun
it be sunday

alastair
he be on

e be today a nation in a state of
shock in mourn in grief that be
so deeply painful to we
people
everywhere not just here in britain
keep faith with princess diana


they liked she they loved she they
regard she as one of the people
she
be the people princess and that be
how she will stay how she will remain
in we heart and memory forever

ANVRINs eye roll privately

bit over the top do not you think
be visibly distress
we hear the priest voice as

notre pere qui es aux cieux
que ton nom soit sanctifie
que ton regne vienne
que ta volonte soit faite

ur la terre comme au ciel


i will always be glad i know the
princess and hope everyone will
support she two fine son and help
they have the life and the future she
would want

i have the honour of host she a few
month ago when she visit we
country and i be tremendously
impress by she



in city all around the world
shrine have be created in a
spontaneous worldwide outpour of
grief
mage of laying flower outside the british



lord airlie


the lord chamberlain
in charge of the
funeral
you be meeting he at the
airport

lord airlie


prime minister
i be responsible for
organising all royal ceremonial
event
and there be simply no precedent for
the funeral of an exHRH

then perhaps we should plan for any
contingency

yes
i have arranged a meet tomorrow
morning at
at buckingham palace
official from all three palace
representative from the spencer
family the emergency service
a beat
would you send some of you people

absolutely
of course

Preeecedent

roll he eye

where do they find these people

i be so sorry sir
and if there be
anything i or i government can do


they stand up as we drive past
in
cafe
in restaurant
remove they
hat
this be paris
one of the
busy city in the world
and you
could hear a pin drop

i imagine it will be the same here

yes
i imagine it will
look at

the palace would still prefer to see
it as a private funeral
what be you
feeling on that

i
i think that would present we with
difficulty


so do i
i mother
the queen come from a generation
not best equip to
she grow up in the war
i think what we need what the
need be to be lead by someone
of
today
if you follow
balmoral be
he gesture another
world

i think i understand
he coffin be draped in the


have we hear from the spencers again
have they make up they mind when the
funeral will be

not i
no one tell i anything



the prince of wales spent half an hour
at the hospital
at
the party
left with Dianas coffin

n we walk today one of the ghilly
said he would see a large stag up at
Craghie head
a beat
he reckon fourteen point

what
really
we have not have one that
big on this estate in year

no
quite



Dianas coffin arrive back in london
at northolt two hour later

nyway i think it might be a good
distraction
for the boy

what
stalking

be not it a bit soon

i think anything that get they
outside be a good idea




arlier today the prime minister make
a statement from he constituency

they liked she
they loved she
they
regard she as one of the people
she
be the people princess and that be
how she will remain in we heart
forever


i be sorry i can not bear it
get to she foot
i be going to bed


check the time

right
it be ten of the clock
let we make a
start
thank you all for coming at
such notice
i think we all agree this
be an extraordinarily sensitive
occasion which present we with
tremendous challenge logistically


constitutionally
practically
diplomatically
procedurally

oh christ


after eighteen year of opposition
of frustration and despair i be
proud privilege to stand before you
as the new prime minister


labour prime minister

i want to set an ambitious course to
modernise this country
to breathe new
life into we institution
to make
privilege something for the many not
the few
so that we become nothing
less than a beacon to the world



bloody hell
you think the royal be
nutter
you should meet they
flunkey
two and a halfhours on
whether she should be carry in a
hearse or a guncarriage
anyway rave in the press


this lot call you the nation
mourner in chief this lot say you be
the only person who have correctly
judge the mood of the country
even
the mail
disdainfully holding the
paper between finger and
thumb
be impress

people princess mate
you owe i
go
watch then jump up open the door

gordon for you

tell he to hang on

so it be decided
it be going to be a
public funeral

yes
on saturday
whopper
the
abbey
the works

good
have anyone tell the queen yet

Dunno
no doubt some flunkey will be
despatch
grovelling on all fours

good morning madam



madam

what can we do for you robin

madam there be a meet at the
palace this morning

about the funeral arrangement yes

the lord chamberlain fax over these
plan for you to consider

there be now general agreement madam
that a public funeral would be more
appropriate

i see
he perceptibly bristle

nd what form will it take

at the moment they be suggest
and of course these be early day

base it on tay bridge

tay bridge

what


Bbut that be the code name for i
funeral


ndeed madam
but it would be for practical reason
only

it be the only one which have be
rehearse
the only one that could
be put together
in time

but i supervise those plan myself

indeed and the lord chamberlain be
at pain to stress the spirit of the
occasion will be quite different
a beat
for example in place of four hundred
soldier marching behind the coffin
the suggestion be that four hundred
representative from the Princesss
various charity march behind the
coffin

i see

and that instead of foreign head of
state and crown head of europe the
guest would include a sprinkle of
actor of stage and screen fashion
designer and other
celebrity

celebrity

oh


wa
be there anything else

o madam

oh yes
one other thing
the police
commissioner be keen that you
consider the idea of a condolence
book
it would give the grow crowd
something to do
make marshalling they
easier

yes of course
reach the door

oh and the flower
he look up


hat flower

the flower that have be left
outside buckingham palace
currently
they be block the path through the
main gate and will make thing
difficult for the changing of the
guard

fine
then move they away
flinch slightly in anticipation

actually the lord chamberlain be
wonder whether we should not leave
the flower and send the guard
through the north gate


Yees
of course
chasten
quite right

tephen lamport on one

who

the prince of Waless private
secretary
in balmoral
covering phone
he said it be urgent

ood afternoon



good afternoon prime minister
private secretary to the prince of wales

the prince of wales wanted i to thank
you again for you kind word
yesterday

not at all

he feel you and he
be modern
man
of similar mind
who could work well together at
this difficult time


well please thank he highness and
assure he that he can count on i
full support
at all time
be that it

yes

bizarre
why be charles do this

what

creeping up to i like this
he do it
at the airport when he ask i to
deal with he mother

ecause he know that if the queen
continue to get it wrong over diana
it will not be long before the royal
become public enemy no

a beat
terrify of be shoot apparently

who charles

he people have already be onto we
asking for extra protection

he probably think if he be see to be
on we side the queen will be the one
left in the fire line not he

what
so it be for he mother to
take the bullet not he
shake head
what a family


wait
where be they

up at Craigghead

i will come with you

want i to drive

certainly not
shudder at the rough interior of the car the mud

i think you be going to get a new

one of these

what for
it be perfectly all right
he drive hard through wood dust kicking up in the
stare out of the window lost in thought

i be think last night what diana
might have do have it be i that
die in the tunnel in paris

she would certainly have taken the
boy to paris
i rather regret not
do that now


what
and expose they to the media
it
would have be a dreadful thing to
do
they be much well off here

look whatever else you may have
thought of diana she be a wonderful
mother
a beat
she adore those boy
and never let
they forget it
a beat
always warm
he queen hand tighten on the steer wheel

and physical
a beat
never afraid to show she feeling

especially whenever a photographer be
in sight

yes she have encourage all that
but still

that be always the extraordinary
thing about she
she weakness and
transgression only seem to make the
public love she
yet ours only
make they hate we
why be that

why do they hate we so much

not we dear

what


yesterday when we drive the coffin
back into london there be a noise

bang
i do not mind telling you i
think it be a gun

i think someone have taken a shot at
i
he hit the brake and pull up
visibly irritated by


why do not you go on without i
i be
going to walk back

be you sure

yes
it look like rain
and i be not in the mood for stalk
anyway

wait
i shoelace be undone
you
do not want i to trip and hurt myself
do you
a beat
you would not get any proper walk
then

right
do
now who know the way
home
he yap excitedly immediately scamper off in the

you clever thing

HARLESs land rover drive up into the hill into


i speak to charles this afternoon
flicker of coldness behind she eye

who be good enough to share with i
he view on motherhood

what do he say
play in the corner
starved thin pandaeyes

how wonderful diana be

that be changing he tune

what a natural

i think
they see i as a threat of
some kind

oh for god sake


maybe he be get a point
maybe we be
partly to blame

i can not watch this

no wait
leave it

every strong woman in history have have
to walk down a similar path


we encourage the match
and signed
off on it
both of we
a beat
you be very enthusiastic remember

she be a nice girl
then

and i think it be this strength that
cause the confusion and the fear


and i be sure he would give the other one
up
or at least make sure he wife
tow the line
be not that what everyone do

be it

why be she strong
where be she
get it from
where be she going to
take it
how be she going to use it



i can not bear it any more
if you be
watch i will sleep in here
early
start tomorrow
kiss she on the
forehead
see you in the morning
she angrily hit the remote
the picture go black

how much of all this could be the
first stirring of


hat

i do not know
something more
interesting
maybe this time people
have finally see they for what they
be

which be

bunch of freeload emotionally
retard
nutter

that be just absurd

why
they exist in a ludicrous cocoon
of privilege and wealth
they do not
pay tax

yes they do


the queen alone cost we what
thirty
forty million a year

ot you too
look
if you want to
have a serious conversation about
this

i do

about the constitution

e do not one

or about way in which we as a
government could begin to phase out
hereditary privilege then fine

if you be going take the dish

but spare i the whole
off with
they head thing

why

because it insult you intelligence

the case for reform be simple and
obvious
it be in principle wrong and
absurd that people should wield power
on the basis of birth not merit or
election

word not mine

well maybe now i have grow up
a beat
it be unimaginable this country be a
republic
certainly in she lifetime


why

because
no would would wear it
can not help laughing at
the idea
no one it
it be just
daft

it be not a mother thing be it

think about it
if she be still
alive would not hazel be exactly the
same age
whenever you talk about you
mother you mention she stoicism
she
frugality
she sense of duty
the fact
she be bring up in the way
well
mon
who do sound like

i be going to do the washingup



all right the good news be that the
palace have agreed to video screen in
the royal park

and the bad news

crash barrier

what about they


hey now predict more than two
million people will descend on london
and there be not enough barrier to
line the route
so we have go cap in
hand to the french for theirs
and
there be something else i think you
should see
follow into an office where a television play

can we run that piece again
you be
going to love this

look i know all this

there
ne member of the public complain about the flag

do not tell i
there be not a flag
flying at half mast above buckingham
palace

god
will someone save these people
from themselves

ine
i will call balmoral
turn away walk towards the door

planet zog

because as prime minister of this
country i have really get nothing
well to do

pull up
the get out with she dog
she

those firelighter no good
carrying tupperware
box
i bring some stew just in case
i
think it be lamb
we could always have
that cold

no we will be all right
he throw some food to she dog but make several

robin have a call from the prime
minister
who expressed he concern
turn an exasperate look

about

the flag above buckingham palace
he
think it should be flying at half
mast
whimper hungrily

then i hope robin told he there be not
a flag above buckingham palace
angrily jab coal with a
long sharp fork
only the royal standard which
fly for one reason only


to denote the presence of the monarch
since you be here the flag pole be
bare
which be as it should be
clear he throat

be not it possible
that to some
people
the royal standard be just
a flag
and that the flap pole be
bare send out the wrong signal

that be not the point

the point be it be more than four
hundred year old
it have never be
lowered for

you grandfather do not get that flag
at halfmast when he die and if you
mother be to die tomorrow she
would not get it either

yes
but sometimes
in a situation
like this
one have to be flexible

it be just a flag

what about the union jack
be mr
Blairs next suggestion

oh for heaven sake

the next thing he will be suggest you
change you name to hilda and mine to
hector

angry gesture
who do he think he be talking to
you be the sovereign
the head of
state
you do not get dictated to
a beat
you have concede the idea of a public
funeral
you have open up the park
that be


you wait
in fortyeight hour it be
all have calm down

like those condolence book

quite right
when we start with one everyone
predict they would grow and grow
but we have hear nothing more about
that see

apparently there be now fifteen

what

and people be queuing through the
night



in one sense it comfort
a beat
for the first time i parent can see
what it be be like for i all these
year be up against she
popularity
but they be still making the mistake
of think the diana they know from
living and dealing with she will
eventually be the one see by the
public
but it be not
the two Dianas
theirs and ours bear no relation to
one another at all


they just adore she
would have loved
nothing more than for she to be queen
a beat
someone compassionate
with a heart
gift in tragically short supply
around here
look at

i have be think be the flag fly
at half mast over i house at
highgrove

yes sir

make sure we get a picture of that in
the paper would you
if i mother
want to make a mess of this that be
she business
a beat
i will not let she drag i down too


see
it be not just i

what

people really want change
and want
to give it to they

and do what
cut off they head

apparently one in six people now
support the idea of get rid of the
monarchy

that be just the paper spoiling for a
fight


but still imagine this country
without they
with a nice elected head
of state
a beat
that would be some legacy
if the
revolution be to happen on you
watch
stare
visibly unsettle
resently the stop
she stare for a moment she face a


that be the stalking party off
e take a deep breath

right we would well have a look at
these paper


show we there be a heart in the house
of windsor say the sun
be pass a copy over to

it prove the royal be not like
we the mirror
time to change the
old guard at buckingham palace
express

god


one can not help wonder who be advice
they be taking for it be clearly the
wrong advice


right

well i will try not to take that
personally

people have be yearn for a
change in this country
good
the
result be a quiet revolution now
taking place
lead by the real
moderniser
the british people

tail off

revolution
not you too
tail off
who write this

where do it come from

where do it come from

just look at the paper
talk to
people on the street

something happening out there


revolution

get i balmoral will you
a beat
i will take it in i office

right
you lot
out

what about the speech

later
he and be finishing off
stand


and finally madam a medal

corporal in kosovo
you may have read
about it in the paper
pulled two
civilian from a bus after a bomb
blast


hurry up dear
get cold

be that it

yes madam
just the letter of
condolence to the widow of the
ambassador to brazil

good

madam apparently the prime minister
be on the phone for you

tell he to call back

no i would well take it
he walk over to she desk again
pick up the phone

prime minister

good afternoon you majesty
i be
sorry to disturb
i be just
wonder




whether you would see any of today
paper

we have managed to look at one or two
yes

in which case i next question would
be whether you feel some kind of
response might be necessary

no
i believe a few overeager editor
be do they good to sell
newspaper
and it would be a mistake
to dance to they tune

under normal circumstance i would
agree but


here we go
the bloody flag again

i adviser have be taking the
temperature among people on the
street and the information i be
get be that the mood
be quite delicate

of course
that be where all the ruddy
camera be
gesture again for to SSSsshhh

so what would you suggest prime
minister
some kind of statement

no madam
i believe the moment for
statement have passed
take a deep breath


i would suggest flying the flag at
halfmast above buckingham palace

see

and coming down to london at the
early opportunity

it would be a great comfort to you
people and would help they with they
grief

grief
he exchange a look with

if you be suggest that i drop
everything and come down to london
before i attend to two boy that have
just lost they mother
you be
mistake

absurd


i doubt there be many who know the
british more than i do mr
blair nor
who have great faith in they wisdom
and judgement
and it be i belief
that they will soon reject this mood
which have be stir up by the
press
in favour of a period of
restrain grief and sober private
mourn
a beat
that be the way we do thing in this
country
quietly
with dignity
it be what the rest of the world have
always admire we for

well if that be you decision madam
of course the government will support
it


let we keep in touch

yes
could hardly be less
enthusiastic
let we

bloody fool

robin Janvrin on one
a beat
he must have be listening in

mr Janvrin

prime minister i understand how
difficult she behaviour must seem to
you
how unhelpful
but try to see
it from she perspective
she be be bring up to believe it
god will that she be who she be

i think we should leave god out of it
it be just not helpful

she will not have see anything like this
since the abdication
a beat


and i cannot emphasise enough what
affect that have on she
unexpectedly
becoming king as good as killed she
father

step out to be greet by the waiting

robin
good to see you


prime minister

tony please
shoot he cuff
clear he throat
the knock

the prime minister madam

do sit down

thank you
sit and stare at the
she face be inscrutable


it be good to see you again
after
quite a summer

i be refer to you visit to india
and pakistan where you comment
about ending historic disagreement
go down very well
ilence

and the commonwealth head of
government meet
i speak to the
prime minister of malawi who be
saying how much he appreciate you
tough stance on nigeria


i mean to tell you at the time but
you be be monopolised rather
ilence

i imagine those occasion be quite
difficult
Twentyfour head of
government each clamour for a
private audience

also we have not have a chance to speak
since week
and i wanted to offer
i apology

whatever for

in case you would feel manhandle or
managed in any way

not at all
beat

i do not think i shall ever understand
what happen this summer

the circumstance be exceptional
madam
and in the end you show
great personal strength courage and
humility


oure confuse humility with
humiliation

that be not true

you do not hear what they be saying
in the mall that friday


i still believe history will show it
be a good week for you

and an even good one for you mr
blair

but there be fiftytwo week in a
year madam
and two and a half
thousand in a half century

and when people come to assess you
legacy no one will remember those few
day

really

you do not feel that what respect or
affection people might once have have
for

this institution have be
diminished

not at all
pause

i gather some of you close advisor
be less fulsome in they support

one or two
but as a leader one
have
a different perspective
a beat
i could never have added i voice to
the chorus

you be very kind


but let we also not forget the more
pragmatic reason

which be

that without i there to distract
everyone it would suddenly become
embarrassingly clear how much
unchecked power the british prime
minister actually have
look up

if fifty year of do job have
taught i anything it be that the
people do generally prefer i
with all i fault to some kind of
meddling president
just look at the french

i suppose we would well get on with the
business in hand

i do love this time of day
shall we
walk while there be still some sunshine
left
i do hope you be a walker

i be

good
the clock go back next week
then it will be dark by five

i always think these meeting stand a
good chance of succeeding if the
prime minister be a walker


as a matter of fact it be how i think
best
on i foot
i have never be one
for sitting around endlessly
good
walk and fresh air sort everything
out

one in four you said
want to get
rid of i


for about half an hour
but then you
come down to london and all that go
away

i have never be hated like that
before

no
and that must have be difficult

it be
very

ever since diana people want glamour
and tear
the grand performance
and
i be not very good at that
i prefer to
keep i feeling to myself
foolishly
i believe that be what people wanted
from they queen
not to make a fuss
nor wear one heart on one sleeve
duty first
self second

it be how i be bring up
it be all
i have ever known

one forget
you be so young when
you become queen


i be
girl

but i can see the world have changed
and one must modernise

well perhaps that be where i can help

do not get ahead of yourself prime
minister i think you will find that i be
suppose to be advise

so
what might we expect in you
first parliament

well madam top of the list be
education reform
we want to radically
reduce classroom size
