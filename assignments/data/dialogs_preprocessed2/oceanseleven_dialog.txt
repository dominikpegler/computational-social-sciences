ten grand
half of it be yours



you barge into i new workplace
ruin i professional reputation
least you could do be tell i
you have get something well for
i

i have get something well for
you



how be tess

alright
tell i

it be tricky
no one ever do
it before
need planning a
large crew

gun

not load one
it have to be
very precise
there be a lot of
security
but the take

what be the target

eight figure each

what be
the
target




when be the last time you be in
vegas

what
you want to knock over a
casino







the vault at the bellagio

if i be reading these right and
i think that i be this be
probably the least accessible
vault ever design
oops
actually you know what
i be wrong
it be definitely the
least accessible vault ever
design

yep



you said three casino

flip to next
blueprint
these feed into the cage at both
the mirage and the


grand
but every dime end up here

the bellagio mirage and
these
be terry Benedicts place

yes they be
think he will mind

more than somewhat



you would need at least a dozen guy
do a combination of con

like what you think

well off the top of i head i would
say you be looking at a boesky a
jim brown a miss daisy two
Jethros and a leon spinks
oh
and the big ella fitzgerald
ever
where do you think you be going to get
the money to back this



as long as we be hitting these
three casino we will get we
bankroll
terry benedict have a
list of enemy

but do he have enemy with
loose cash and nothing to lose
aha

aha

reuben



so

so here what i think
you
should take this plan kick it
around for a week or two
sleep
on it
turn it over in you head
then
never bring it up to i
again

Uhhuh
so what be you saying

i be saying
this be like trying
to build a house of card on the
deck of a speed boat

really

harder than that

find what
you wanted

past those lie the elevator and
this be where it get tricky
the
elevator will not move without
authorize fingerprint
identification

which we can not fake

and vocal confirmation from
both the security center within
the bellagio and the vault below

which we will not get

furthermore the elevator shaft be
rig with motion detector

meaning if we manually override
the lift the shaft exit will
lock down automatically and we will
be trapped

once we have get down the shaft
though then it be a walk in the
park
just three more guard with

Sauls package
arrive at sevenfifteen and
linus grab we code
all go
well there and we be a go
seven
thirty virgil and turk deliver yen
and we be committed
from that
point we have thirty minute to
blow the power or he suffocate
we the miniature of the vault then




this be the real deal
the bellagio vault
clock read





once the electricity go all
entry point to the vault and it
elevator will automatically lock
down for two minute
that be when
we make we move
two guard wheel in a cash cart and leave it in the
vault center and march out again closing the thick
metal door behind they
when the vault
we just above the cash cart
there
be silence for a spell the light flicker out then
the false top of the cart spring open reveal yen
within folded neatly
rev



he inhale deeply then slowly unspools himself from the
cash cart until at last he crouch atop it
he take
in the room
vacant and silent
except for rusty who walk right by he incongruously

okay
they have put you in the
middle of the room far from
everything
you have to get from
here to the door without touching
the floor
what do you do
reveal we be


the bellagio vault have be fully reproduce here and
what we have be watch have be a trial run
ten of
the eleven turk and virgil in guard costume basher be
still miss watch from offstage like a film crew
watch a dress rehearsal

fin say he shorts it

make it a sawbuck
from a dead squat yen leap hand first from the cash
cart to a ledge five yard away and grip it safely with
both hand without touching the floor
from this
position he will inch he way to a counter then to the
door
frank pay up
behind he a and he turn to
see basher at last
sniff the air he doubletakes
bashers covered headtotoe in sewage

we be in deep shit


linus hose basher off he accent angry and thick as he
spit out water and the story of he afternoon and if
nobody understand a word he be saying that be okay

you understand any of this

i will explain later

blow the backup grid one by one
like domino

as he hardly
understand
this either
basher
what happen


cabal of city engineer investigate subterranean fuse
box and basher tail they hide near a waterfall of
effluent



they do exactly what i planned to
do
only they do it by accident
now they know they weakness
and
they be fix it
an draw the attention of the city
engineer and basher retreat into the waterfall


basher towel off he hair

so

so unless we decide to do this job
in reno we be screw
danny rise and pace frustrated
he be come too far for
thing to go awry now
rev




we could

by tomorrow
danny keep pace
rusty hang he head and think
basher dry he hair

an idea occur
to he
we could use a pinch
danny stop
rusty look up

what be a pinch


scientist demonstrate the pinch a lithium wire in a
glass vacuum tube the size of a small refrigerator



pinch be the equivalent of a
cardiac arrest for any broadband
electrical circuitry
or well
yet
pinch be a bomb
but
without the bomb
every time a
nuclear weapon detonate it
unleash an electromagnetic pulse
which shut down any power source
within it vicinity
that tend
not to matter in most case
because the nuclear weapon
destroy everything you might need
power for anyway
now a pinch
create a similar electromagnetic
pulse but without the headache of
mass destruction and death
so
instead of hiroshima you get the
seventeenth century



for how long

about ten second
rev




could a pinch take out the power
of an entire city
like i
do not

las vegas
but there be only one pinch in the
world big enough to handle it
danny and rusty trade a look
they have they answer
