i start think about
what happen to all the garbage
i mean where do we put all of
it we have to run out of place
to put it eventually do not we
this happen to i before when
that barge with all the garbage
be strand and nobody would take
it
remember that



yes i remember
what do you do
when these mood overtake you

nothing
i mean nothing
i try
not to do anything that will
produce garbage so obviously we be
talking about eat and basic
stuff like that
do you know that
the average person produce three
pound of garbage a day

no i do not

do not you think that be a lot of
garbage
i would really like to know
where it be all going to go

do you have any idea what trigger
this concern

well this weekend john be taking
out the garbage and he keep
spill thing out of the
container and i start imagine
a container that grow garbage
like it just keep filling up and
overflow all by itself and
how could you stop that if it
start happening

ann do you see a pattern here

what do you mean

well last week we talk about
you obsession with the family
of airline fatality and now
we be talking about you concern
over the garbage problem

yeah so

if you think about it i think
you will see that the object of you
obsession be invariably something
negative that you could not possibly
have any control over

well do you think many people
run around think about how happy
they feel and how great thing
be
i mean maybe they do but
i doubt those people be in
therapy
besides be happy be not
all that great
i figure be always
at it good when i be depress
the last time i be really happy
i put on twentyfive pound
i
think john be going to have
a stroke

it be true i be telling you



as soon as you have get a ring on
you finger you start get
serious attention from the opposite
gender
seriously i wish i have
super bowl seat for every time
i have some filly just come up
and start talking to i without
the slight provocation
that
never happen before i get
marry
shit if i would known that
i would have go out and buy i
a ring when i be eighteen and
saved myself a lot of time and
money

shit i get to be someplace
look racquetball thursday
you be
the cool

uh janet reschedule kirkland
tell he to come in friday at


be you still keeping these
thought from john

yes



be you afraid of he reaction
of he finding you silly for
think of such thing

no
i do not know
i have not tell
he about the garbage thing because
i be pissed off at he right now
he be letting some old college buddy
stay at we house for a couple
of day and he do not even ask
i about it
i mean i would have
said yes i just wish he would have
ask



what upset you about that

i guess i be upset because i can not
really justify be upset i mean
it be he house really he pay
the mortgage

but he ask you to quit you job
and you do have housework

yeah i know

this unexpected visit
notwithstanding how be thing
with john

fine i guess
except right now
i m going through this where i
do not want he to touch i



when do you begin have this feel

about a week ago
i do not know
what bring it on i just start
feeling like i do not want he
to touch i

prior to this feel be you
comfortable have physical contact
with he

oh yeah
but see i have never really be
into sex that much i mean i like
it and everything it just do
freak i out i would not miss it
you know
but anyway lately we
have not be do anything at
all
like i said it be not that
i miss it but i m curious the
way thing kind of slacked off
all of a sudden

perhaps he sense you hesitance
at be touched

but see he stopped before i get
that feel that be why it seem
weird to i
i mean i be sure he
wish i would initiate thing
once in awhile and i would
except it never occur to i i be
always think about something
else and then the few time that i
have feel like starting something
i be by myself

do you do anything

what do you mean

do you masturbate



god no

i take it you have never masturbate

well i kind of tried once
it
just seem stupid i keep seeing
myself lying there and it seem
stupid and kind of uh i do not
know and then i be wonder
if i dead grandfather could see
i do this and it just seem
like a dumb thing to be do when
we do not know what to do with all
that garbage you know

so it be recently that you tried
this

curious

graham be an unusual name

yeah i guess it be
i mother
be a complete anglophile anything
british make she drool like a
baby
she probably hear the name
in some movie
she be a prisoner
of public television now

oh uhhuh

be you uncomfortable with i appearance

no i think you look
fine

oh
well maybe i be uncomfortable
with i appearance
i feel a little
out of place in these surroundings

well

i used to take great pleasure in
that be purposefully different
rub people nose in it
do not you do that when you be
young

no not really

oh
well i do
i be in a band
once and the music be always
secondary to just flat out
offend as many people as
possible

you play an instrument

no i be in charge of kind of
standing at the microphone and
recite these really depressing
lyric in a monotone
the whole
thing be really
irrelevant
how do you like be marry

catch slightly off
guard
oh i like it
i like it very much

what about it do you like
i be
not be critical i would really
like to know

well
well the cliche about
the security of it that be really
true
we own a house and i really
like that you know
and i like
that john be just make junior
partner so he have a steady job
and he be not some

freelance
you know

yes
so you feel security
stability
like thing be going
to last awhile

oh definitely
i mean just this
past year have go by like phew
i hardly even know it passed

do you know that if you shut
someone up in a room and the only
clock he have reference to run
two hour slow for every
twentyfour that he body will
eventually adjust to that schedule
simply because the mind honestly
perceive that twentysix hour
be twentyfour the body follow
and then there be section of time
you life can be broken down into
the section of time that form
you personality
for instance when i be twelve
i have an eleven minute conversation
with i father that to this day
define we relationship
now
i be not saying that everything
happen in that specific section
of time but the event of i
childhood involve i father lead
up to and then be crystallize
in that eleven minute

oh uhhuh

anyway i think the mind be very
flexible as far as time be
concern

you mean like time fly

exactly
i would say the fact that
you feel the first year of you
marriage have go by quickly means
lots of thing
or could mean lots
of thing

how long have it be since you have
see john

nine year

nine year

yes
i be surprise that he
accepted when i ask if i could
stay here until i find a place

why
do not you know he well

i know he very well
we be
extremely close until i drop
out

Whyd you drop out

oh lots of reason most of they
bore
but up until i drop
out john and i be
very much
alike

that be hard to believe
the two
of you seem so different

i would imagine that we be now
i think i be ready to use the
bathroom finally

call the cop



that be the first thing that run
through i mind when i see you
i think this be not the same
man that ride the unicycle naked
through the homecoming parade

you do that

everybody have a past

what do you think the greek would
make of that outfit you be wearing

bonfire probably

this food be excellent

thank you

yeah it be not bad
usually ann
have some serious salt action going
i keep telling she you can always
add more if you want but you can not
take it out

you have family here also

mother father sister

younger

afternoon

really
how do it go

she held up very well

so i be asking about you sister

oh we get along okay
she be just
very
she be an extrovert
i think
she be loud
she probably would not
agree
definitely would not agree

be you going to see elizabeth
while you re here

i do not know

who be elizabeth

girl graham dated
still live
here far as i know

graham and i be talking about
apartment and i told he to check
the garden district there be
some nice little place there
garage apartment and stuff

stay away from the garden district
serious crime
i do not know what
kind of place you be looking for
but there be a lot of studiotype
apartment available elsewhere

i wish i do not have to live
someplace

what do you mean

well see right now i have this
one key and i really like that
everything i own be in i car
if i get an apartment that be two
key
if i get a job maybe i
have to open and close once in
awhile that be more key
or i
buy some stuff and i m worry
about get ripped off so i
get some lock and that be more
key
i just really like have
the one key
it be clean you know

get rid of the car when you get
you apartment then you will still
have one key

i like have the car the car
be important

especially if you want to leave
someplace in a hurry

or go someplace in a hurry

do you pay tax

do i pay tax
of course i pay
tax only a liar do not pay
tax i be not a liar
liar be
the second low form of human
being

what be the first

lawyer

hey ann why do not you go with
graham to hunt for apartment
show he how the city have changed

would you mind

no

okay i will





hello

cynthia
john
meet i at i house
in exactly one hour

you be scum
i will be there




plenty of room for two people

it will just be i


student

no
you said threefifty


plus first and last month deposit

will you lease monthtomonth


not for threefifty

how about for five hundred


that i can do



john

in here

be not you a picture

maybe you will understand this
because you know john but he
confuse i sometimes

how do you mean



it be hard to explain
it be like
john treat everybody the same
you know
i mean he act just
as excite about seeing somebody
he hardly know as he do when
he see i
and so i feel like
what be different about i if i be
treated exactly the same as some
acquaintance
if i do not like
somebody i do not act like i do
i guess that be why a lot of people
think i be a bitch

yeah i know
i mean i be not
saying i know people think you be
a bitch i be saying i know what
you mean
and i do not even know
that people think you be a bitch
do they

i feel like they do

hmm
well maybe you be
really
i would not pay much attention

i know that i just do not feel a
connection with very many people
so i do not waste time with people
i do not feel one with

right right
i do not feel
connected to many people either
other than john

can i tell you something personal
i feel like i can
it be something
i could not tell john
or would not
anyway

it be up to you
but i warn you
if you tell i something personal
i might do the same

okay
i think
i think sex be
overrated
i think people place
way too much importance on it
and i think that stuff about woman
wanting it just as bad be crap
i m not saying woman do not want
it i just do not think they want
it for the reason man think they
do
i be get confuse

do you understand what i be trying
to say

i think so
i remember reading
somewhere that man learn to love
what they be attracted to whereas
woman become more and more
attracted to the person they love

yes
yes
i think that be very true
very

so what about kid

kid
what about they

do you want they

yeah actually i do
but john
do not
at least not right now

why be that

i do not know he just said he want
to wait
i quit asking

so what be you personal thing
be you really going to tell i
something personal

do you want i to

as long as it be not
gross you
know
like some scar or something
it have to be like mine like
something about you

agreed

i be impotent

you be what

impotent

you be

well let i put it this way
i
cannot achieve an erection while
in the presence of another person
so for all practical purpose
i be impotent
ann take a large sip of wine
graham light a cigarette

do it bother you

not usually
i mean honestly
i have not known many guy that
could think straight with an
erection so i feel i be way ahead
of the game as far as be
clearheaded go

well
be you selfconscious about
it

i be selfconscious but not in
the same way that you be
you
have get to be the most attractive
selfconscious person i have ever
see

why do you say i be selfconscious

well i have be watch you
i have
watch you eat i have watch you
speak i have watch the way you
move and i see somebody who be
extremely conscious of be look
at
i think you really believe
that people be looking at you
all the time
and you know what

what

they be looking at you
ann you
be truly breathtaking
i do not
know if you understand how you
appearance can affect people
man
want to possess you woman wish
they look like you
and those
that do not or can not resent you
and the fact that you be a nice
person just make it bad

i therapist said that

you be in therapy

be not you

hah
no i be not
actually i used
to be but the therapist i have
be really ineffectual in helping
i deal with i problem
of
course i lie to he constantly
so i guess i can not hold he totally
responsible

so you do not believe in therapy

i believe in it for some people
i mean for i it be silly i
be confused going in
so i just
form i own personal theory that
you should never take advice from
someone of the opposite sex that
do not know you intimately

well i therapist know i
intimately

you have sex with you therapist

of course not

oh see i mean someone you have
have sex with
that be part of the
theory

excuse i for asking but how would
you know

well i be not always impotent

now you said never take advice
from someone that you do not know
intimately right

basically yes



so since i have never have sex with
you by you own advice i should not
accept you advice

that be correct
bit of a dilemma be not it



well i do not know
the week
start off okay but then i be
outside watering the plant and
i start feeling dizzy from the
heat and that get i think about
the greenhouse effect so i go
inside and turned on the
airconditioner full blast and
that make i feel a little good
until i start think about
radon leakage coming up through
the floor and

radon leakage

yes it be this radioactive gas
in the ground and house kind
of act like magnet to pull it
up andyou have never hear of
this

no i have not

well the cumulative effect be
not good let i tell you
i know i should not have watered
those plant

do you confront john about the
visitor

what visitor

the friend of johns that be
staying at you house

oh graham
no i do not talk to
he about that
actually that
turned out to be pretty
interesting
i expect graham
to be this
well like john you
know
i mean he said they have
go to school together so i be
expect lots of story about
get drink and secret handshake
and stuff
but he turned out to
be this
this kind of character
i mean he be kind of arty but okay
you know

be he still at you house

no he left last week

do you find he attractive

what do you mean like physically

let i rephrase
be you attracted
to he

i guess but not because of the
way he look or anything
he be
just so different somebody new
to have a conversation with
i be
just tire of talking to other
couple about whether or not
they be going to buy the station
wagon you know
it be just bore
i do not know he be just
different
and he be really on about
truth a lot be honest and
i like that i feel comfortable
around he
after he left i have a dream that
he signed a lease to rent we guest
room

so where be he from



i do not know
he go to school
here then he be in new york for
awhile then philadelphia and
then just kind of travelling
around

must be nice
so what be he like
be he like john

no not at all
actually i do not
think john like he much anymore
he said he think graham have
get strange

be he
strange i mean

not really
maybe if i just see
he on the street i would have say
that but after talking to
he
he be just kind of
i do not
know unusual

Uhhuh
so what be he look like

why

i just want to know what he look
like be all

why so you can go after he

jesus ann get a life
i just
ask what he look like

besides even if i decided to fuck
he brain out what business be
that of yours

do you have to say that

what

you know what
you say it just
to irritate i

i say it because it be descriptive

well he do not strike i as the
kind of person that would go in
for that sort of thing anyway

ann you always underestimate i

well i wonder why

i think you be afraid to put the
two of we in the same room
together
i think you be afraid
he will be undeniably draw to i

oh for god sake
really
cynthia really i do not think
he be you type

i type
what be this bullshit
how would you know what i type
be

i have a pretty good idea

ann you do not have a clue
look
i do not even know why we be
discuss this i will just call
he myself

he do not have a phone

well i will call he when he do

but he will not

what be you talking about

he be not get a phone he
do not like talking on the phone

oh please
okay so give i the
zen master address i will think
of a reason to stop by

let i talk to he first

why
just give i the address
you will not even have to be involved

i do not feel right just giving
you the address so that you can
go over there and

and what

and
do whatever it be you do

lose something

that goddam diamond stud earring
that cost i a fuck fortune

be you get mom something for
she birthday

i do not know i will get she a card
or something

card
for she fiftieth birthday

what be wrong with that

do not you think she deserve a
little more than a card
i mean
the woman give birth to you
it s
she fiftieth birthday

will you stop
jesus

i just think it might

okay ann okay
how about this
you buy she something nice and
i will pay for half
all right

fine

good
now if you will pardon i
i have to go to work



i be think maybe i should not
be in therapy anymore

what bring this on

i have be think about it for
awhile and then i be talking
to somebody who kind of put thing
in perspective for i

i think that be what i do
who
be it that you talk to

that guy graham i told you about
he said taking advice from someone
you do not know intimately
be
well he said a lot of stuff

ann in life one have to be aware
of hide agenda
do it occur to you that graham
may have he own reason for not
wanting you to be in therapy

what do you mean
i do not
understand

it be possible that graham have
hide motive for dislike
therapy andor therapist
perhaps
he have problem of he own that
he be unwilling to deal with and
he would like to see other people
you for instance wallow in they
situation just as he do
do you
think that be possible

i guess

you understand that you be free
to leave therapy at any time

yes

that you be under no obligation
to i

yes

do you want to leave therapy

not really

do you feel there be more progress
to be make

yes

i be glad you feel that way because
i feel that way too

but you do not have hide motive
for feeling that way right



it be open

hi

ann
hello

be you in the middle of something

he take one too
he said okay
and then we go into the wood
behind we house
i get this
feeling he be chicken out
because he keep saying lady
first
so i pulled down i
underpants and urinate and he
run away before i even finished

be it ever a topic of conversation
between the two of you afterward

he kind of avoid i for the
rest of the summer and then he

like and then what do it really
feel like

it be warm than i think it
would be and the skin be soft
than it look
it be weird
thinking about it now the organ
itself seem like a separate
thing a separate entity to i
i mean after he pulled it out
and i could look at it and touch
it i completely forget that there
be a guy attached to it
i
remember literally be startled
when the guy speak to i

for god sake ann i be not
fucking you sister
i do not find
she that attractive for one

be that suppose to comfort i

i be just saying you know
i
do not get paranoid when you do not
want to make love
i could have
easily assumed that you do not
want to because you be have
an affair

but i be not

i be not either

why do not i believe you

look this conversation be utterly
ridiculous
maybe when you have
some evidence we should talk
but do not give i conjecture and
intuition

always the lawyer

goddam right
i mean can you
imagine
you honor i be positive
this man be guilty
i can not place
he at the scene or establish a
motive but i have this really
strong feel


you have make you point

i be sorry
it be just
i be under
a lot of pressure with this
kirkland thing it be i first big
case as junior partner and i work
all day i come home i look
forward to seeing you and
it
hurt that you accuse i like that

i be sorry too
i
i get these
idea in i head you know and
i have nothing to do all day but
sit around and concoct these
intricate scenario
and then
i want to believe it so i do not
think i have wasted the whole day
last week i be convince you be
have an affair with cynthia
i do not know why

i do not either
i mean cynthia
of all people
she be so

loud

yeah

i do not say it be rational i
just said i be convince

be not therapy helping at all

i do not know
sometimes i feel
stupid babbling about i little
problem while child be
starving in the world

quit you therapy will not feed
the child of ethiopia

i know

you never used to say fucking




it be just so blatantly stupid
i have a hard time believe you
do it

what be so stupid about it

that you
you do not even know
the guy

well you know he he be a friend
of yours do you think he can be
trust

shit after what you have tell i
i do not know
i should have known
when he show up dressed like
some arty brat

what if this tape get into the
wrong hand

the wrong hand
we be not
talking about military secret
john
they be just tape that he
make so he can sit around and
get off

jesus christ
and he do not have
sex with any of they
they just
talk

right

jesus
i could almost understand
it if he be screw these people
almost
why do not he just buy
some magazine or porno movie
or something

do not work
he have to know the
people he have to be able to
interact with they

interact fine but do you have
to masturbate in front of he
for god sake
i mean

i feel like it so what
goddam
you and ann make such a big deal
out of it

you told ann about this

of course
she be i sister
i
tell she almost everything

i wish you have not do that

why not

it be just something i would prefer
she do not know about

she be a grownup she can handle
it

i just
ann be very

hang up

it just be not a smart thing to
do
do you sign any sort of
paper or do he have any contract
with you saying he would not
broadcast these tape

no

you realize you have no recourse
legally
this stuff could show
up anywhere

it will not
i trust he

you trust he

helluva lot more
than i trust you

what do you mean

exactly what i said
i would trust
he before i would trust you
how much
clear can i be

it hurt that you would say that
to i

oh please

but at least i know
you be a liar
it be the people that
do not know like ann that have to

you son of a bitch

not very often

i would

have you ever wanted to make love
to someone other than you husband

Goddamit

answer he goddammit

you be hesitate
i think that
mean you have

shut up

you do not know what i be think

it be a simple question
have you
ever thought of havingmaking
love with someone other than you
husband

be he going to see this

absolutely not

i have think about it yes

you bitch
i know it

do you have sex before you be
marry

yes

do the person you make love with
satisfy you more than you husband

god damn you

yes

and you have think about
making
love to that person again since
you ve be marry

i do not see what difference it
make i mean i can think what
i want
i do not know if i want to do this
anymore i be afraid
i do not mind
answering the question so much
but if somebody be to see this

at some level i do not understand
you nervousness
have you decided
to leave john

yes i have
i will

then as far as this tape go
you have nothing to worry about

i guess not

do you want i to stop

no

be there people other than you
previous lover that you have
fantasize about

yes
whenever
all right look
whenever i see a man that i think
be attractive i wonder what it
would be like with he i mean
i be just curious i do not act on
it but i hate that i think that
i wish i could just forget about
that stuff

why

because that be how cynthia think
all she do be think about that
stuff and i hate that i do not
want to be like she i do not want
to be like she

you be not like you sister
you
could not be like she if you wanted
to

i know
deep down i know that
it just bother i when i have
feeling or impulse that she have

so you do fantasize

yes

about who

i fantasize about you

about i

yes

have you fantasize about i

i think i make that clear before
when i said i would go down on
you

i remember
you could do that
could not you
go down on i

yes

if i ask you to would you
not
on tape i mean

no

on tape

no

why not

if i can not do it all i do not want
to do anything
and i can not do
it all

can not or will not

can not

you said you be not always
impotent

that be correct

so you have have sex

yes

who be the last person you have
sex with

she name be elizabeth

so what happen
be it so bad
that it turned you off

no it be wonderful
that be not
the problem

what be the problem

the problem be i
i be
i be
a pathological liar
or be i
should say
lying be like
alcoholism one be always
recover

so you lie to she

yes
i do
willfully and
repeatedly

how come

i loved she for how good she make
i feel and i hated she for how
good she make i feel
and at that
time i tend to express i
feeling nonverbally
i could not
handle anyone have that much
control over i emotion

and now you can

now i make sure that no one have
the opportunity to test i

do not you get lonely

how could i with all these nice
people stopping by
the fact be
that i have live by myself for so
long i can not imagine living with
another person
it be amazing what
you can get used to if enough time
go by
and anyway i be asking
the question
be you happy

i do not know anymore
i think
i be but obviously i be wrong

do you confront john with the
fact that you know about he

not yet
i be not sure i will
i
just want out

if you do get out of you marriage
will you continue to be inhibited

i do not know
it all get back
to that cynthia thing
i do not
like she
eagerness
there be
nothing left to imagine there be
no

subtlety

subtlety yes
no subtlety
plus
i have never really feel able to
open up with anyone
i mean that
other person i told you about
i enjoy making love with he
a lot but i still be not able
to really let go
i always feel
like i be be watch and i
should not embarrass myself

and you feel the same way with
john

kind of
i mean johns like this
kind of
craftsman
like he be
a carpenter and he make really
good table
but that be all he
can make and i do not need anymore
table

interesting analogy

i be babbling

no you be not

god i m so mad at he

you should be
he lie to you
so do cynthia

yeah i know but somehow i expect
that from she i mean she will do
it with almost anybody i do not
know i should not stick up for
she i guess but he
he lie
so
deeply
ooo i want to watch
he die

you be really never going to make
love again

i be not planning on it

if you be in love with i would
you

i be not in love with you

but if you be

i
i can not answer that precisely

but i feel like maybe i could be
really comfortable with you

that be very flatter

so why will not you make love with
i
why would not you i mean

ann
be you asking i
hypothetically or be you asking
i for real right now

i be asking for real
i want you
to turn that camera off and make
love with i
will you

i can not

why not

i have tell you

but i do not understand

ann it could happen to i all
over again do not you see
i could
start to

but how do you know for sure you
have to try to find a way to fig

i could not face she if i have sleep
with somebody else

who
elizabeth

yes

you mean you be still in contact
with she

no

but you be planning to be

i do not know
possibly

wait a minute wait a minute
what be going on here
do you come
back here just to see she again

not entirely

but that be part of it

yes

like maybe a big part

possibly

graham i mean what do you think
she reaction be going to be if
you contact she

i do not know

look at you look at what be
happen to you look how you have
changed
do not you think she will
have changed

i do not know
i really would rather
not talk about it

whoa
i be so glad we get that
on tape
you will not answer a
question about elizabeth but i
have to answer all these intimate
question about i sex life
graham what do you think she be
going to make of all these
videotape
be you going to tell
she about they
i can not imagine
she be too understanding about
that
but since you do not lie
anymore you will have to say
something

as i said i have not decided what
to do exactly
perhaps i will not
do anything

oh you just moved here to think
about it right

oh god graham this be
so
pathetic
you be not even
what you pretend to be you be
a lie you be a big lie than
you ever be

all right you want to talk about
lie let we talk about lie ann
let we talk about lying to yourself
you have not be able to sleep
with you husband because you be
no longer in love with he and
maybe you never be
you have not
be honest with yourself in longer
than you can remember

yeah you be right
but i never
claim to know everything like
you and have all these little
theory
i be still learning i
know that
but i do not feel like
i have wasted time
if i have to go
through i marriage to get to where
i be right now fine

but you
you have wasted nine
year
i mean that have to be
some sort of weird record or
something nine year
how do
that feel

do not do that

why not

because

because
that be not good enough
i ask you a question graham
i ask you how do it feel
how do it feel mr
i want to
go down on you but i can not
do
you know how many people you have
suck into you weird little
world
including i
come on
how do it feel

i can not tell you like this

i be just going to keep asking until
you answer
i be sure there be plenty
of tape

i do not find this turning the
table thing very interesting

i do not care

not until i get some answer
tell
what you feel
not what you think
i have hear plenty of that
what
you feel

come on

all right
all right
you want
to know
you want to know how
i feel
i feel ashamed
be that
what you wanted to hear

why be you ashamed

jesus christ ann
why be anybody
anything
i think you have this
idea that people be either all
good or all bad and you do not
allow for any gray area and
that be what most of we consist
of

you be not answering i

well what kind of answer be you
looking for ann
what be it
exactly that you want to know

i want to know why you be the
way you be

and i be telling you it be not any
one thing that i can point to and
say that be why
it do not work
that way with people who have
problem ann it be not that neat
it be not that tidy
it be not a
series of little box that you
can line up and count
thing
just do not happen that way

but why can not you just put it all
behind you
can not you just forget
it
all that stuff you do

no ann i can not
i can not forget
it
it be not something i can fix
it be difficult
there s something
in i mind
the way i brain
works
frustrated
god ann when you be with another
person and you re
inside
they you be so vulnerable you be
revealing so much
there be no
protection
and
somebody could
say or do something to you while
you re in this
state
of
nakedness
and they could
hurt you without even knowing it
in a way that you could not even
see
and you would withdraw
to make
sure it do not happen again

i want to touch you

i want to touch you

no

graham

keep you eye closed

graham

i be okay
it be okay

it be okay

i never told you this because
i think it would crush you but
now i could give a shit
i fuck elizabeth
before you
broke up
before you be have
trouble even
so you can stop
making she into a saint
she be
good in bed and she could keep
a secret
and that be about all
i can say about she



man not have to answer to
anybody
i feel like this huge
weight have be lift from i
shoulder
i mean come on if
i decide that i would rather live
alone what be so bad about that
it be not like i have decided to live
a life of crime right
it be just how i feel you can not
help the way you feel you just
have to be honest about it
