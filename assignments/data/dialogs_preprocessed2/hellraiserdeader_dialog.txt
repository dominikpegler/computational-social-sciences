charles

katya be breathing fast now but we can not be sure if it be
terror or passion or some combination of both
she
continue to lie on the mattress the barrel of the gun
pressed against the side of she head

i be not real
i be not
winter reach out hesitant and cock the gun in she hand
meanwhile we see other hand reaching in pressing a fold
up towel against the opposite side of she head
other hand
come in and press a doubledover pillow against the towel

i be not real

she close she eye grit she tooth
she back arch

drop she cigarette as it burn down to she finger
she
stand

katya hold she breath
and pull the trigger
there be a huge as the bullet tear straight
through she head
we can see it splatter out the other side
tearing through the towel and the fold over pillow which
catch a great blast of bone and brain
we hear some scream in the room
jump back

have you called the police on this


just watch

i want to know if you have called the
pol

i said just watch


oh man do not tell i that be some
special effect

you tell i

this be sick

that be saying a lot for you
the camera be now pointing at winter
there be a look of deep
tenderness in he face as he circle around and kneel down
stare toward katya who be lying as dead as dead can be
on the mattress
blood have run from the ghastly wound down
both side of the plastic and towel on the side of the bed
catch the mess
winter reach down and gently remove the gun from Katyas
lifeless hand
and then light as a feather lie down on
top of she
the camera move forward and down as marla presumably
elbow she way through for a good vantage point
the camera
move in close as winter stretch out along Katyas body
he place he lip on she forehead kiss she lightly then
press he lip against hers kiss she or maybe
something else
it seem almost as if he be breathing into
she
he body move as he lung expand and expel and he
seem to be struggling toward some nonsexual climax
watch both repel and fascinated


winter continue he odd ritual finally taking a great final
breath as if he be reach the point of exhaustion and
expel it
nothing happen
he lean in close

amy lean in close as well

he draw in another breath he seem to be in agony as he
do it press he lip to Katyas dead one and
exhale
the breath seem to go on forever longer than it
should
and then when it seem as if winter can not breathe out
another teaspoon of air Katyas body abruptly twitch
beneath he and then she suck in a rag breath
she
previously open and lifeless eye move
she head raise up

she simply stare breathing again for the first time in a
moment unable to quite take in what she be seeing

winter exhausted look down at katya smile
there be
nervous laughter sound of relief from around the room
winter slide off of she
katya look this way and that
presumably at the other looking down at she
hand reach down and she take it
the camera follow as
winter pull she unsteadily up to stand
all this despite
the fact that there be still an exceedingly large and obvious
hole in she head
the size of a dime on one side the size
of a halfdollar on the other
the other move in touching she congratulate she
she be
still a bit shaky uncertain
then she lift one of she hand
to the side of she head the side with the big exit wound
she touch it gingerly confirming that it be really there
then she slowly slide she finger
they penetrate she
skull unobstructed to the second knuckle
katya take she
finger from this ghastly wound and stare at they bloody
yet she be alive
fine

she look up at the other then smile widely
the other
move in giving she hug peck on the cheek
she touch the wound again
she start laughing

it
i be fine

she touch the wound again

i feel great
she start laughing

oh man

the image cut off go to snow
there be a moment of
silence
amy turn to charles

amy though be only half listen lost in she own
thought

how could she


who said miracle can only happen at
lourdes

who said they happen there
she lift she finger to the side of she head duplicating
the action of katya slipping she finger inside the wound

amy

no that be a different time
this time

store front
and he said you know if i
could tell the future i would not be
living in any crappy store front

he look back at the tape

if i could do that i would not be hanging
out in some rundown basement
i would own the
earth

maybe they be just get start

maybe

what else do we have besides the tape

just a return address on the envelope
he hold up the envelope which be addressed to

amy hesitate
snatch the envelope out of

she just smirk and exit


a train rolling through the countryside




cab pull up to the front of the build
amy get out and
walk up to the front door

she pull an envelope out of she bag
it be the one that the
tape come in
she check the name on the envelope

compare it to a name on the mailbox


amy walk past the lobby and up the stairs


amy make she way down the narrow dark hallway and find the
appropriate door
she knock at it
no answer
she look down and see a lone fly crawl out from under the
door
then another follow and another
she kneel down to
inspect it
she lean forward and sniff
the result be inconclusive
then she lay herself flat down on the floor press she
nose up against the bottom of the door and sniff
the smell of dead wretched air be overwhelming
and that be when a large step into frame right in
front of amy



irritated with appropriate
accent
have you lost something
amy leap up in one quick move to find herself face to face
with an old man who be a little winded from his
climb up here
between he tooth he clench a half chewed
three quarter smoke cigar
the smoke seep through his
yellowed tooth

yes i ah
she pat she pocket
then try another tactic

no

week so i get nervous
the manager stare at she in disbelief
know she be up to
something
amy sniff the air coming from the room again

do it always smell like this in here
the manager blow a bloom of smoke out of he nostril
he
yank the cigar from he mouth and sniff
do not seem that
bad to he

like what

the manager stare at the money for a beat then stare back
at amy
he bite down on he cigar and snatch it out of she
hand

five minute
he pull out he ring of key and unlock the door
amy enter
the place be dark and cold
eerily quiet
the
manager stay in the hallway he look at amy and tap his
watch
amy nod as he pull the door closed
she descend down the dark hallway
she face tighten as she
take in the deathly ripe air
the of fly get
louder with each step
as she approach a room she recoil clutch she face
from the stench
she inhale draw in the smell to
acclimate herself and almost vomit
she steady herself
draw in breath through she nose tentative at first and
finally in large breath until she can tolerate it
he look back toward the entry door she be alone



amy step in and stop struggling to keep herself from
retching
no sign of anything dead
no sound except the sinister
buzzing of fly
amy step cautiously in
she look toward one side see a closet with a double
slide door
she slide open one side see nothing that
should not be there a rag winter jacket a green plastic
raincoat a hangar festoon with scarf some other garment
still obscure beneath cleaning bag plastic
she hesitate then calmly slide the other side open
more
of the same
she turn in the other direction
there be a little kitchen
nothing dead there
she start forward then turn back
stare at the refrigerator
she go quickly over and tug
it open
it be empty
not so much as a ketchup bottle
curious she open the freezer
the same
empty
she head through the live room and down a narrow corridor
leading to another bedroom
at the end of the hallway be a
bathroom
the door to the bathroom be open and the toilet on
the far wall face the door
marla be there
dress only in bra and panty she be sitting on the close
lid of the john leaning forward in what seem at first to
be an impossible angle
she hand hang forward almost
touching the floor
she head be cocked back stare up
she
skin be gray swollen
amy take a few step forward for a good look
as she
approach she see the reason for the odd position of the
body
long bootlace have be tied around Marlas neck and tied
to the wall pipe on the toilet
the flesh of she neck have
swollen out almost bury the bootlace
she have hang
herself in this ghastly way
amy take another step forward
as she do there be a sudden
loud buzzing as the fly that crawl on marla abruptly rise
up alarmed at she approach
but they soon return to the corpse crawling about the face
around the edge of the glaze eye around the margin of
the open mouth rim with dry foam around the outthrust
tongue

amy cover she mouth with she shirt trying to filter out the
stench
she back away from the body and into another room

amy start to search fast thorough she be do this
sort of thing before
she find a journal open it
no
write
she toss it aside
pull open a drawer
she tug
out what look like a bladeless knife handle
she press a
stud

she toss it back in the
drawer tug some other stuff into view
some bill some shoelace loose change
she go drawer to
drawer looking for anything that might mean something
sock rag underwear cheap jewelry tee shirt and short
skirt and jeans
amy stop surveying the territory
where to look next
then
deciding she go to the bed
she reach under it sliding she hand around tug out a
dustencrusted skirt
feel around some more hesitate
pull something else out
she bring it out into view
it be a
desiccated mouse
she grimace and toss it back under the
bed in disgust
she stop
then slide she hand between the mattress and
the box spring
she feel around then stop finding
something
she pull out a little red paper folder the
kind that photograph come from
she open it
it appear to be a photographic record of another dead
party
we see some of the same participant we also see
marla herself in some of the picture
she be smile
amy
flip the next photograph
it show marla next to winter
he be holding something in his
hand
amy look closer
amy turn another
photograph and it show somebody holding the box out in front
of marla
the picture be framed through a length of rope with a noose
on one end
marla be on the other side almost a kind of
joke photo
she have a kind of sickly smile on she face
Amys eye
narrow
she hold the picture closer
there seem to be a
figure lost in shadow and the close she look the more
reality merge with the grain of the photo
what be there

man

amy hear a scratch noise coming from outside the room
she stuff the book in she satchel
amy turn toward the door that lead to the hall and the
unseen bathroom
she sit silent waiting
then the sound of the scratch come again
the sound of
fly rise and again more distinct something
scratch
she keep she position still listening
nothing
just the slow steady untroubled buzzing
she move toward the bathroom
and again there be the tiny scratch and the rush of sound
as if something have disturbed the fly
the sound stop
the fly be still except for the
occasional buzz
she advance until she can glimpse the edge of one of
Marlas hanging outthrust hand the tip of one finger just
touching the floor
Marlas long fingernail be painted
green

she come around the edge of the bathroom door
marla be
motionless
she lean from the pipe by the shoelace
the shoelace be
still buried in she throat
the fly buzz up again
the
glaze eye remain fix in they socket
one of she hand
be not visible from Amys position
we see scratch on the
floor beneath she fingernail
amy steel herself and then walk close
on the corner of
the sink there be a thick manila envelope with something
bulky inside something that look just like a cassette
tape
there be a name written on it and the marker be right
next to it
it read
amy must reach past the corpse in order to reach the
envelope horribly close to the body in do so
she enter the cramp space and reach toward the sink
she
be about six inch shy of grab it
she notice that she
hip be almost touching Marlas face as she lean
the fly
stir
the stench rise
she stretch close and Marlas body be push aside a few
inch
closer and closer reach

she outstretched finger just manage to touch the envelope
she pitch it and pull it toward she
it fall off the sink and onto the floor behind marla
now amy must kneel and reach past marla face
she hold she
breath as she reach long and far
she manage to grab the envelope but she face be almost
cheek to cheek with the rot corpse
as she pull the
envelope up she notice something else in Marlas hide
hand

amy reach over and pries open Marlas hand
she blacken
finger snap as they be pull off the box
amy grab the
box and envelope stuff they into she bag and stand
as she stand next to Marlas body suddenly

amy shriek and swat the dead hand away falling backward
onto the floor as she do
she roll over and in a half
crawl halfscramble get herself back up to she foot
amy back up against a wall kicking marla as she kick the
floor
we can not tell if marla be moving from the kick or if
she be somehow alive
either way it to much for amy
she
stop moving
Marlas mouth emit a ghastly sound as a stream of liquid
fall to the floor
it almost as if she be trying to speak
amy have see enough
up she go as she tear down the hall
through the live room and
which needless to say scare the shit out of she
he be
standing inside the now open door to the apartment

she be dead

dead

dead
she hung herself in the bathroom
call the police

the manager grab amy by the arm
he pull the cigar from his
mouth and point it in she direction
amy hear police siren
in the background

already do
who be you
pointing he cigar at Amys
satchel
what do you have in there
in a flash amy twist she arm out of he grasp and sling
she knee up into he nut
he double over


amy come flying down the hall at top speed
she reach the
top of the stairs and start down

and as she do she
foot slip
she slide down five or six step then overbalance
throwing out she hand to keep she chin from hitting the
polish stone step
she keep sliding down finally over
balance again flipping over and landing on she back on the
landing halfway between the floor


dammit
the manager look down the stairs for she
he do not even
attempt to chase she

stop she
he curse she in he native tongue


amy break through the door of the build
she hit two of
the ten stairs down to the sidewalk
people walking by hardly
notice
up ahead a police car be turning down the street
she stop
and walk calmly diverting she eye
the police car race
by and amy walk fast and fast then run



close on a tray of ice be cracked apart
it be content
pour into a open towel
amy be sitting on the floor in front of she couch now
dressed in only panty and a bra an image unpleasantly
reminiscent of marla especially with the spot of
bruise and roughly bandaged scrape on she pale skin
she have a drip ice pack in one hand which she apply to
this bruise and that and a bottle of gin in the other
she
do not look happy
she take a drink then look toward a
and in front of she
there be a tape halfinserted into the
we can see the
empty envelope with written on it lying on the floor
he tape be within reach of Amys bare foot and she lift a
toe toward it hesitant
she put she toe against the
tape
hanging on the edge of decision
finally she shove
it forward with she toe
it slide into the machine
she grab up the remote and turn
on the set
the appear
it be marla looking like she have not sleep in day sitting on
a chair in she apartment stare into camera

she descend the long non
work escalator the only one on it at this time of
night
she reach the subway platform
it be virtually empty
amy have come down stairs that land she just about in the
middle
she scan the far end of the platform past a lone
in a who lie motionless
on a bench
a couple in security uniform maybe
heading for some night shift somewhere stand not moving
hand thrust in pocket
she turn back to the bench but the in the
be go
she take up a position at the far end of the platform
she
wait
moment later a bit of a breeze start moving she hair

few second later a train come roar into the station
amy watch the car pass she one by one as the train slow
the train be virtually empty
one car after the next roll by
as the train slow
finally as the train move slowly to a stop a car different
from the other come in
this one for some odd reason
seem to have newspaper covering all the window taped up
from the inside

one of the door of the covered car come to a stop directly
in front of the spot where amy be standing the spot marked
by the stenciled
there be a pause then the door
slide open just one the one set in front of amy
the
other stay close
the interior of the car be dark the

he gesture toward the adjoin car

next car

come on in
she enter
the door slide close
the train pull out


the interior of the car have be transformed into some odd
ball cross between a very small nightclub and an crackhouse
as the train pass out of the station and the light dim
we can see the light from joint and crack pipe or at
any rate something be smoked in some kind of pipe
glinting in the darkness
various hand reach up and tug down
the newspaper and the tunnel light come in provide a
flickering constantly changing illumination
in the uncertain light amy can see the various
hanging out some on the seat some on the floor some
dressed some partially undressed some engaging in desultory
drug use other in desultory sex act mostly teenager
and twentynothings
amy look around not particularly effect by the oddness of
the scene
the conductor touch she arm

down that way
she thread she way through the tangle of people
in the
flickering light she catch glimpse of pale human flesh
that we
can not even be sure what they be
expression flash by in the flickering light some dull
other laughing

she pretty much ignore it all as she make she way toward
the rear of the car
rat feed on the content of a young
woman purse as she and another woman be tangled in
passion
there illuminated in flash a thin i willshaven
english guy in he midtwenties be sprawled on a seat

the conductor shout from somewhere

the light from the station shine through the newspaper
joey looking drab in the steady uneven light stare at amy

amy stand on the platform as the door hiss shut
the train
pull away
she check she watch then move to the other
side of the platform
she look down the tunnel
the light
from an approaching train be beginning to reflect off the
curve wall of the tunnel
she turn back in the direction she just look
far down the
platform there be a bench with a lone occupant a slump
over figure dressed in a
she turn
toward it stare
in the distance no detail of face or
form be visible just the lumpy figure in the shiny green
raincoat
she take a step toward it but still cannot make
out any detail in the slump over figure
she approach
as do the train
there be no sign of movement
she come around closer to the edge of the platform to get
a more direct view of the greencoated form
as she do she
see that one hand be draped off the front edge of the bench
hanging limp
the hand be gray
amy take a step forward

he eye pop open
he look at she with large black eye
dead eye
drip from beneath he raincoat be a small pool
of fresh blood
amy gasp take a step back and she heel land on the
edge of the subway platform
she struggle for balance
abruptly a mane voice come from somewhere

amy klein
amy stumble forward go down to she knee and turn
around twenty foot behind she stand on the edge of the
platform with he back toward the drop be

he look down the tunnel
amy do as well
the train be
coming into the station
she turn back toward winter
he
stare at she with malevolent eye
and as the train come flying in he calmly fall backward
directly into it path
amy scream
in an instant she be up running alongside the braking train
the door open but virtually nobody come out
the front of
the train be still far ahead

hey

middleage face lean out the

somebody fell

of the train

where

she look back in the direction from which she be come
the
bench be now empty

confuse face of people peek out through the door of the
train
there be no sign of winter



the train be still there door open
there be
on the station disgruntled passenger hanging out on the
platform
be poke around underneath it
amy be leaning against one of the metal pillar stare at
the empty bench at the place where the mysterious figure
be sitting
she be looking grim
behind she a track worker approach the who be
standing with a pair of transit cop
he be shaking he head
shrug
the driver curse head back toward the first
car
one of the approach amy

the train start to move out of the station
amy look toward
it
the train be moving on one of the center track so that
you can look through the window of the car and see through
they to the platform on the far side

and um
i see this man standing on
the edge of the platform facing away
from it
but now amy be seeing something through the window of the
moving train
on the platform on the far side there be a
lone figure the man in the black trenchcoat
amy jump
look more closely

do he say anyth

in an instant amy be tearing down the platform heading for
the stairs that connect to the platform on the other side

even with the rather large cop on top of she
she be still struggling

she keep struggling as the first cop and the other on the
station converge on she
she look toward the far platform

the figure be still there visible through the window of the
depart train
then the last car of the train pass
leaving an unencumbered view of the far side
the platform be empty
no sign of winter
no sign of anybody
amy stop struggling as the cop tug she arm back
handcuff she
she hardly notice but keep stare at the
empty platform across the track
she glance up at the cop
panting tomislav look down at she
then circle he finger
around he ear to he comrade

whore
amy glance up at he without expression

charles hop in the cab and drive off as amy walk up the
step to the hotel lobby
amy watch he go wave then
spin back towards the curb
she flag down a cab and hop
in


rag rundown place looking bleak and ugly in the
bright light of day
we see the street sign identifying the
place Poteilari and Minvara
cab pull up and amy get
out
she cross the street pass one side door and then
come to a build that be be sealed up door and
window cement shut with cinderblocks
beyond a narrow railing be a stairway press up sideways
against the build running down to a basement entrance
amy look down the stairway to it be narrow bottom
the stairs
and the bottom be litter with trash
filthy mattress
lie at the very bottom
amy head down


at the bottom of the stairs there be a wooden door
hole
have be punched through it and a heavy padlocked chain have
be thread through it and through a heavy hasp that be be
bolt to the door frame
some official government notice of
some kind have be tacked to the door long render
unreadable by the effect of time
amy inspect the padlock
it be heavy and uncompromising
she
tug on the door and it open to the limit of the chain
but that be only a few inch
amy peer into the darkness
beyond but can not see a thing
she look down at the mattress that she be standing on step
to the side and shove it up
then as if the light break she reach out grab the hasp
and pull
the bolt holding the hasp to the wall be loose
they slide out with it
she tug the whole thing free and
pull the door open
there be a narrow corridor beyond all in gloom
amy enter


amy step in she way illuminated only by the indefinite
light that leak in from the street

there be an archway presumably leading into the rest of the
basement on one side but it be blocked by a great heap of
rubble
amy ponder the chance of get through it and decide to
check out the rest of the hallway
she work she way through
a series of ominous corridor
amy sense that she be not alone stop and turn around
no
one
she continue
there be only a single door left at the far end of the
hallway
it hang halfopen but we cannot see what be inside
she approach it reach out and push the door open
it be
a bathroom
as she enter we see a beyond she in the hallway
buried in the shadow


this be one of those nasty little makeshift place build into
an available corner basically a toilet and a sink so close
that there be hardly room to move
mop and some other
supply long forgotten be prop up in a corner
amy step in look down the toilet
nothing left but some
nasty stain the water long dried up
she face brush
against something hanging in the air
she pull back
it be a
pull string hanging from a naked light bulb
she tug on it
nothing
no power here
she stand in the dark claustrophobic place puzzle
she
look back down the hall
it seem as if she be come to
another dead end
then she stare at the bathroom door
open
now it block a piece of the bathroom wall the only place
she have not look
amy step back virtually straddle the toilet and push
the door closed
as she do of course what little light
there be vanish completely
if there be something behind
the door she can not see it or anything else
abruptly there be a sharp click as she light she lighter
and the wavering light illuminate the tiny bathroom and
the previously unseen space behind the door
the wall do not meet there
there be a narrow gap lead
to a passage apparently between the wall perhaps ten
inch wide

hesitate only a moment amy turn sideways and slide
herself into the claustrophobic slot
she hold the lighter
up ahead of she but it dim flickering light do not reach
to the end of the passage
she move forward cautiously
the floor be litter with dry chunk of plaster rotting
insulation seventyfive year of stuff crumble from the
inside of the wall
as she disappear into the tunnel the door slowly open
behind she
passing across the rusty doorknob a menace
blade appear
inside the tunnel amy reach a vertical pipe up against one
side of the wall only a few inch thick but it reduce
the available room to under eight inch
she hesitate
meanwhile the lighter in she hand be get hot
she let we
it click off
in some dim halflight we can see she slipping
a handkerchief carefully around it for insulation
she flick the flint
the light light
and abruptly around a million roach which have return
from they hide place in the absence of the light go
skitter every which way
amy let we out a squeak as the roach vanish in an instant

christ
she look at the pipe again and then start to squeeze past
it
it be a tight fit
she have to squirm to get through

welcome to club anorexia
she pop free and come out the other side
she hold up the
lighter
still the light cannot reach to the end of the
passage
steel herself she move on
but as she do the
space seem to get progressively narrow and narrow
from ten inch to nine to eight until both side of she
body be scraping against the wall
she hold the lighter
out
the wall continue to narrow
at the end of she outstretched arm the wall be only around
five inch apart

what the

clearly she be reach the end of the line
annoyed she
start to back out then realize that the light on the far
side of she body render the area into which she be now moving
essentially black as midnight
she bring the hand holding the light close in to she body
but she can not bring she hand together in front of she the
space be too narrow
finally she reach she hand up over
she head passing the lighter from one hand to the other
directly over she head
as she do the lighter almost slip
she grab for it but
it go out
again she be lost in virtual darkness
she strike the flint
it flicker but do not light
as she
strike it again
amy
do not see it we do

the light return now illuminating the other side of she
body the way from which she be come
but because the space
be so narrow she can not turn she head towards the entrance
once again the roach go skitter away
and amy start heading back from where she entered
she
head facing away from she progress backward trying to
squeeze through
she hold up the light it light the area ahead which
she cannot see
the flickering fire expose the figure
awaiting she
the wall on this side now also seem to narrow
the space
revealed by the light be barely as wide as she fist and
there be only darkness beyond
darkness and the figure with
the knife
amy sense something be wrong

what the
she continue but now she can barely move a few foot before
the wall become too narrow to pass
she push trying to
shove through the narrow gap
but she cannot move
the wall
have literally closed in until she be now squeezed between
they
panic set in
gasp amy push against the wall she be facing
trying
desperately to turn she head around
she force with all she
might to turn she head she facial feature stretching almost
comically
she finally get it around

she be face to face with the knife as it come
narrowly missing she arm
amy scream and drop the lighter
now in darkness she
scurry frantically away back deeper into the space
amy start struggling panic growing on she trying to climb
to crouch to tug free in some direction but she movement be
very limit
the wall seem to close in on she
she be struggling to breathe against the press wall
the
figure keep advancing towards she

stop
please stop
stop this
she be flailing she arm now frantic
the knifewielding
figure struggle have difficulty as well
one of Amys
hand fly back and hit the wall behind she
now she really panic she hand desperately scraping along
the wall looking for anyway out
there be not any
she look back toward she attacker who be now right on top
of she and raising the knife for one final blow
amy brace for the blade impact as she push against the
wall when suddenly she
fall backward onto the floor
she heart pound
she
breathing heavy
she check she arm for wound
there be not any
she look up
the figure be go
she stand confuse and find herself in an empty room
some discard junk a pile of loose plaster
she leap
forward and nearly trip on a piece of rubble to get the
hell away from the entry
odd thing be
here be no entry
she whip herself around towards the sound of someone sharply
exhaling
she look this way and that but can not see the source of the
sound
the attacker
pale light be visible coming from around a far corner
someone step into the light
young
he hold a
finger up to he lip


shhhh
follow i
he signal she to follow he
amy move cautiously forward

the wall have be partially torn down
the light come from
an adjoin room
amy approach cautiously remain in
the shadow and lean forward stare through a gap in the
wall into the room beyond
the various participant some of whom we recognize from the
videotape movie be standing crowd around something on the
floor
amy can not see just what it be that they be stare at
at first but she do see that one of the one gathered
there be katya complete with the hole in she head
she
nervously put a a finger into the hole and inspect the
blood
the sound of the exhalation be coming from the unseen place
then somebody in the circle move to get a good vantage
point and now amy can see clearly what be going on
winter be lying on top of the corpse of a
breathing into he mouth as he do with katya
an almost
sexual encounter yield the same result as the tape
he take a final deep breath
and then as before the young
man gasp
winter pull away
as he do we can see the
young mans face smile despite the knife that be lodge
into he chest
winters grab the knife and yank it out
the other come forward helping he up
winter stand and somebody slip a robe over he body
he
promptly look straight at amy still hidden in the shadow

i have a room of i own
kindly join i
he throw the knife at the wall where it embed itself in
way **further/far then it should have and walk away
amy move
away from the open
she circle around through a doorway
and into the space that she be previously watch
she move forward hesitantly trying to avoid the touch of
the various occupant who do not behave aggressively but
clearly press forward into she personal space
she look this way and that trying to find where winter have
go

hand come down on she shoulder
she turn suddenly
it be
the black kid
he gesture

winter through there
he point toward a doorway lost in shadow
amy notice on
he point hand that he wrist have be deeply slashed
she look down to the other hand which the kid politely
offer for she to examine
amy back away through the crowd
following she be the
recently revived young man who be still completely naked
he smile at amy
she move away and through the door to
winters room


this be a small dark space light coming mostly from a
rather conventionallooking stand lamp
in the shadow
beyond the little space of light be a confusion of halfopen
door wall and shadow half light room with unguessable
occupant
winter be there sitting in a pad chair in front of a
coffee table reading a book
amy step inside
winter
do not react to she presence
abruptly the door close
behind she
she hesitate and walk forward

amy klein

amy pause unsure then move forward and take a seat
opposite he

that be a hell of a way in
make i
think that you do not want

people come in here the way they want
if
it be difficult then that be the way

mystery
that be what you expect
that be
what you find

winters put the book down
he attention be now on amy

be you afraid amy

and
during you little rite of passage
through the wall

amy open she bag and produce the puzzle box
she lay on
the table between they

what be it

i great grandfather created that box
he left it as a
gift
way to cheat
death an entrance to everlasting
pleasure and it belong to i
though
there be other who would disagree

marla warn i about it about you

really
should i be honore or afraid
that you be here amy klein
do you
really think you can just go along with
we for a little ride and then get off
when it suit you
like you new friend
on the train
you be not going to find it
so easy to get off this train


so i should not get on

you already on it
do not dance with i
amy klein
do not think for a second that
you be not in danger
you be in more
danger than ever imagined possible

what the hell do that mean
winter lean into Amys space

listen to i
there be thing that be
true in the light of day
there be other
thing that be no less true that live
in the shadow
when you shine a light on
they they disappear
they stop be
true
that be because it be the
uncertainty of the dark that make they
possible
if the dark be deep enough
anything might be happening in it
anything at all
i be one of those thing

what happen to marla chen
what do you
do to she
he stand and walk away from amy

that be all i have ever do for the people
who come to i

she do not want to become one of you
whatever the hell you be
that be why she
killed herself

oh but she do
and what make you so
sure she be dead
winters study amy face

we all die over and over and over again
marla can not commit suicide
all she can
do be stop believe that she be alive
and she can not even do that


the more she doubt the dead she
become
but she will never really die
because she be not really alive

that do not mean anything
what i see in
that room be real
what i smell be

she rap on the table with she middle finger palm up
she
then lift she hand up keeping she middle finger towards
winter

through the chair and be front of amy she hand held tightly
by he

possibility that the space you occupy

the closet

he be pure evil



close on Amys hand trembling in winters grip

for a moment she appear to consider he offer
then as

but now the dead be there surrounding she reaching out for
she
they begin to chant

abruptly water begin to cascade down onto she face
she turn herself sideways and roll over gasping
she be in
a bathtub

slide glass door scraping herself across the tiny peg of
glass that still line the border of the frame
she pull herself up she hand feeling for a light switch

she hand sweep across a small table at the end of the hall
smashing over a



the room be dark drain of all color the way thing appear
when we see in they in almost total darkness

Amys lying in bed on she stomach
the sheet have crumple off
of she

abruptly there be the sound of a wettish thud and amy seem
to bounce a little
she eye open but she be not alarm
still lying on she back she flick she eye this way and
that but seeing nothing she close they again
few second later we see some black liquid trickle across
she shoulder coming from the unseen center of she back
it
follow a course down she backbone then swerve and find a
path along the inner edge of one of she shoulder blade
finally trickle down she neck
it continue to flow
staining the pillow by she face
she stir slightly clearly feeling the trickle
she put she
hand to she shoulder smear the black liquid
still half
asleep she try to brush it off
but it continue to
flow
finally she eye open
she sit up painfully and look
at she hand stained with this sticky black stuff
she
stare at it not quite awake enough to figure it out
she reach over she shoulder pull she hand back stain
with the black stuff
she look down at she pillow also

confuse she rise painfully awkward and head
toward the bathroom
we can see that she foot leave blackish
wet footprint across the floor as she move toward the
bathroom


she move in stare in the mirror see the side of she
face and she shoulder smeared with black
she fumble for
the light flip it on
in the sudden shock glare of returning light
abruptly reenters the world
and the black of the liquid
that be stain Amys face and hand that track the floor of
the whitetiled bathroom that smear the wall where she
flip on the light switch turn instantly to it true color

the color of blood
amy gasp at the sight she look like she be just crawl
out of a slaughterhouse
she reach behind she feeling she
back trying to find the source of the blood that seem to be
pouring out of she dripping to the floor pouring down the
small of she back staining the back of she panty a vivid
ghastly red

in a sudden impulse she turn on the water in the sink full
blast wash away the blood from she hand scooping
handful onto she face and the front of she body
the water
drip to the floor commingle with the blood turning it a
nasty pink
she reach behind she back feeling again she hand come
back as vividly red as before
again she wash they
she
stop dead seeing something in the mirror
something be glinting between she breast
she touch she
finger to it
it look like a tiny bit of gleam metal
poke out from inside of she almost like a tiny steel
splinter
it appear to have just barely broken through the
skin from inside barely a drop of blood
she stand stare down at it breathing fast
what the hell
be it
then slowly almost against she will she turn she back to
the mirror and look over she shoulder
she see and we
see for the first time the center of she back where she
questing hand could not reach
there be a knife there literally thrust through the middle
of she back
the gleam splinter between she breast be the
tip of the knife that have literally transfix she and

cabinet
holding one hand against the mirror she start to push away
wince in pain
we can see the tiny silver tip between she breast vanish
from view draw back inside she body
slowly making a
wet sticky sound the long thin knife begin to slide out
with a gasp she heave out
and the knife go fly

then let we go home
they jump down to an abandoned track and head into the
darkness


strange twist tunnel with eerie blue light
pipe
running along the ceiling dripping water and hissing steam
amy and marla march quickly towards camera

for the reward from it all
the tunnel start to take some weird twist and turn
they stop and marla turn amy in she direction
the place
start to tremble a train be approaching from far off

but it be not enough for somebody else to
stick a knife into you
you have to come
to the point where you can do it to
yourself that be the acceptance
the
final preparation before you give you
soul to it
willingly

but why
what it be all for

that part he
keep to himself
but he promise an
eternal paradise filled with the ultimate
pleasure
we just can not be afraid
and

he head out
amy watch he go
she wait a beat and then
hop out of bed
she look around for nurse and orderly
but there be no one around
she exit frame


blank wall light with flickering fluorescent light
there be
a hanging from ceiling in the corner showing
of a blooming rose a little homage to the
original hellraiser

we move to find a various assortment of but none of
they be watch the they be too busy entertain
themselves and they invisible friend

amy enter cautiously feeling a little threatened by the
other patient
she look around not sure where she should
plant herself and then she see she
sitting off by herself in the corner of
the room draw picture
few of they a half humanhalf
monster clawing at a closet door a child screaming a child
running from the monster a child holding a butcher knife
etc
be taped on the wall behind she
amy walk over to she
there be just something about she

mind if i join you

please
i be draw picture

i can see that they be lovely

want i to draw you picture

i would like that very much
the little girl stare at amy and focus in on she feature
we can not see what she be draw as she little hand start to
move across the sketch pad
but there be something a little off
she hand do not move
like a sixyearold would draw it move with the confidence
and control of an adult
amy try to get a glance at the portrait
the little girl
pull it close to she

no peaking

i be sorry you be right
with a few more stroke the draw be complete
the little
girl study it pleased with herself
she spin it so amy but not the audience can see it
she eye wide with terror

what do you think

as we get we first good look at it
it be Amys face as a twisted and stretched in a way
that begin to reveal the skull around she
there be also that nasty knife wind in the center of she
chest with hook stretching the skin back and to the side



i only draw what i see
amy
amy back away from she trembling

how do you know i name
the little girl giggle
amy turn to the other drawing that
the little girl have taped to the wall

hey too now all look like Cenobites some look like Deaders
one look just like

no
this be not happening
amy get up to run but then she freeze when she see
sitting on the opposite side of the room
but here
the thing
she look fine
amy walk over hesitant confuse

marla
marla do not seem to recognize she

marla
you be alive

you say that like it be a good thing
marla take a long quiet look around the room and then lean
in close unable to keep up she charade

you know he be watch we

who



winter
this be where he send all the
trouble maker
try to show we who be
boss
try to make we believe

so it be real

as real as you want it to be
we all have
we own version of the truth some be
just more screw up than other
but you
would not know that because you still
do not know the truth

i do not understand

you will
you see that be the point
all
this Deaders Cenobites whatever
you want to call it it be all about
solving the puzzle
part of that puzzle
be you
finding the secret that be
hidden within you
marla poke a finger at Amys heart
right on she wound

in there
and as soon as you find that
as soon as you face it you will be free
once and for all
he pull back into she chair

i i be still looking


but what be it all for

ultimate pleasure more than anyone
even those who have solve the puzzle
before we have ever known
condition of
the nerve ending the like of which you
imagination could not hope to evoke
marla stare at amy deeply
the break into a smile

at least that be what they say

marla look around the room to see if anyone be watch she
and then she take Amys hand and lean in close

problem be winter can not solve the puzzle
only a few choose one with just the
right amount of depravity and loneliness
in they soul can
beat
so he be be on this quest for year
searching for that mythical person who be
both will to join we and can also
solve the puzzle
and it would seem amy
klein that that person be

i

bingo baby
sorry
she be trying to give amy a clue without tip off anyone
who might be watch she

he have to be there for you amy
and he
will be
like he be for all of we
that be the key
without he you can not
come back
it be you he want
it you he
need
remember that above all
marla look down at Amys chest
amy follow she stare to
find blood starting to soak through she hospital gown
Amys
eye begin to glaze over

look like you be running out of time
amy leap up from the table and suddenly marla be go
in
fact the whole room be empty and dead quiet
pool of blood
lie beneath she seat
she stagger a bit as she move
forward


the main corridor
it seem to go on forever
amy turn back to the common area
empty
the she hear the familiar sound of
it be faint and echo

amy turn back down the corridor to the little girl voice



it be all about finding the truth
amy start to slowly make she way down the long cold
corridor
with each step she take the wall of the corridor become
white slowly bleach out
she look below she and see
the blood now draining from the wound
she stumble back slowly and turn as the
continue
then she hear the and of a door
like
someone fighting to get out



half walking half stumble out of one of the
room at the far end of the corridor
he be dressed in a
stain white tank top shirt he eye glaze and distant
he be know the source of the noise and he be piss


back to scene
amy keep stumble down the corridor



now amy be within the flashback
she look good no blood
almost peaceful
she father look down the corridor toward
amy but do not seem to see she
he turn and storm off in
the opposite direction
amy can not believe what she be seeing but she can not help
herself
she follow he


back to scene

amy be stumble more than walking as she grow weak with
every step
she eye begin to glaze over and she vision be
beginning to blur
she look down to find the trail of trail
behind she on the otherwise floor
when she look back up she find herself in



the hallway from Amys childhood home
she father be now only
a few step in front of amy as he reach the door to his
office
he turn into it and we follow amy as she step into the
office behind he to find


the rattling at the far side of the room
the
little girl be screaming
on the other side
we now know this door
she father march
toward it he rage build


back to scene
amy scream out to he

leave she alone


he hand tighten around the knob
he open the door raising he free hand ready to strike a
powerful blow
stand there quietly with the sweet smile on
she face
then
the in


but it be over in a blink as she quickly bury it deep in his
chest
he stumble back from the closet in slowmotion as


amy scream
she react to the violence
she vision be blur and fade fast as she life rush out
of she
she turn back to she father and everything be in slowmotion
as we

she father stumble back
amy lose consciousness
she father falling backwards
the knife buried up to the
handle in he chest
amy hitting she knee and wobble there for a beat trying
to hold on
she father head falling backward
Amys head falling backward onto the floor
young amy stand there and stare without emotion
as she eye flutter
close
and then young amy all alone in the world
stand there over
the body
we see for the first time a smile from the young
girl


as we quickly to find she lying
on a mattress in the middle of the floor surround by

she be in the middle of the ritual
the Deaders
be all chant
marla and joey be there



i skin be not real
i eye be not real
i muscle be not real


i bone i heart i vein and nerve
and flesh and meat

what i
see what i hear what i taste what i
touch what i remember what i think
what i feel be not real
with a glance she can see that the in it solve
configuration sit on a makeshift altar at the head of the
mattress
be tower over she at she foot
he hold out a knife
for she to take

you have go through this before amy
go
through it again with i
amy have a sudden look of resignation mixed with a little
relief
she reach out and slowly take the knife from
winter

the
second i see you i know you be the
one
the chant continue

i skin be not real
i eye be not real

heart i vein and nerve and flesh and
meat

what i see what i

amy look at marla
she look dead then ever
she chant
with the other
winter hold the knife closer for amy
amy look at the
start to stretch
out like hand and swirl from the

start to take shape and swirl behind they
winter be please

it be work
i know it

with we
Amys hand start to tremble

i can not

yes you can amy

all you have to do be take this final
step and let the pain go
and welcome a
world of ultimate pleasure
bluish white stretch out from
the trying to grab joey who duck
it be grasp
the Deaders break the circle around amy as more reach
out from the void
the twisted and
warp scream out for help in the wind that out of
the void
reach out and grab the outstretched arm
drag they back into the
back into hell
the Deaders turn to winter they be all a little freak
out
from the look on they face it be clear that this be not
at all what they expect

where be the naked chick
the oil
the
orgy
it be not what winter expect either

finish it amy

i can not

finish it
amy steel herself with sudden resolve

i do not think so

and with that amy into the makeshift alter
next to she
and that be when
step through the void and into this world
few
follow
all the Deaders step back this be weird
even for they
amy leap up and stumble back as pinhead slowly approach
winter carefully study he as he do until he be right
in winters face

i see that evil do run in the family
inter be play it tough
but it be all an act

you lineage be of a craftsman
you
should have stay in the family
business
i sacrifice i mortal self for
that box

it be mine now
it belong to i

that be where you be painfully wrong
we
belong to it

it created you and it can destroy you
amy finish it

when it be do with i perhaps but
i be afraid one own personal hell be
eternal as you will soon see
pinhead take in the puzzle box on the makeshift altar the
Deaders amy

the box be not just the map of the road
it be the road itself

the ultimate experience


experience be a funny thing boy it like
to test we first and teach we later
be
you sure you can pass the test
be you
sure you want to

you can not hurt i
pinhead smile

it be not the first time i have hear that
it be
they reach out from the void all around winter and stab into
he
he scream out in complete agony as they tear at he and
stretch he limb to the point of ripping they off


and it will not be the last
winter scream subside as a rush of pain surge through
he numb he
he be just able to turn he head to pinhead and crack the
slight fuck you smile
winter try to talk but the skin around he mouth be
stretched too tight

when you attempted to challenge evil you
enter into i domain
there be no way
in but through i
pinhead get in close to winters face

careful what you wish for
now we can see the terror in winters eye

it just might come true
winter scream as he be finally torn apart by the chain
pinhead turn he attention to the


this world it obviously disappoint you
all
perhaps that be why you choose to
begin this journey
and as long as you so
willingly accepted allow i to finish
off what he start
and out of the darkness an oversize come
straight through the midsections of
all the deaders lined on the right side of amy
pierce
they at all different level
then another chain the Deaders on the leave side
the
Deaders look like fish on a stringer
they dangle there
suspended by the chain

and as for you
you opened the box you
bring we all together
you choose
wisely
i be please

i do not want any of this

to open the box

anything
amy look to marla she be get the fear of god in she
pinhead

the far reach of pleasure
to a world
where suffer be taken to high level

truth

and now you have it
but knowledge come
with a price and it be time to pay

what about they

we see the now with snakelike tongue working
they way up the line of Deaders towards amy
they be
preparing each one as they pass
poke they with large pin
piercing they stitching they fillete they etc

they belong to i now

themselves willingly through he to i
and now it be time for you to do the same

she glare at pinhead with a sudden look of
confidence like a light bulb have go off and she can
finally see she way out
