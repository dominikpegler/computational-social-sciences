suzy go off to join michael and the foreign
office delegation near the front
suzy look over to

well quickly then swap
simon and judy swap seat
the meet be now underway
we be with karen clark

we all agree this be a very tough time
but i do not want a consensus to form
around the premise that conflict be
necessarily the primary option at this
point
back with simon judy and toby
simon still strain to
see

be people think that
that be a bit
hardcore
he crane again to see

ground this do you liza
liza react
she paper
in a big meet
be this good or
bad

illuminate the logistical factor we
face
she highlight a number of reason
why in practical term we can not
envision a theatre deployment for twelve
month

although not everyone might agree with
the assumption make in that paper

really such as what

the committee feel a much quick
deployment be possible

which committee

this have be discuss in a number of
committee
if i said one committee

you do

then that be a slip of the tongue

have you accidentally allude to some
secret committee
war committee

if i can interject here i be aware we be
push for time
i would like to move we on
agendawise
we next item be
international relief coordination

have you hear of this committee

what be this liza weld paper



simon be watch feeling the meet be passing he by

should i say something
she invited i i
should say something
if you do not say
something in the first minute you
can end up not saying anything at all

anything

i be saying something

going to try saying something
simon go to put he hand up toby maybe put a calming
hand on he hand

will not ever change
it be not imutable
or
mutable
it be an ongoing

mutual agreement we can not rattle through
here and see how much time we have at the
end for this discussion
he be end the debate

okay get
the minute of the meet we need to
correct the record

yes we can
they be an aide memoir for
we

version right

bob adriano be going through the minute with

people in it

so welcome to this somewhat engorge
session of the future plan committee
you can all see an agenda
people be looking at they agenda lowlevel chatter
pouring of water etc
a general premeeting feel

assistant secretary here on point
it feel like there be an assumption that
we will be invading
should we talk about
the practical
i mean this be the war
committee after all

it be the future plan committee

unofficially it be known as the war
committee

well unofficially we can call anything
whatever we like
unofficially this be a shoe
but it be
not a shoe karen it be a glass of water
and this be the future plan
committee



malcolm be running down the corridor
he run into room

it be empty

bitch




karen be talking




but what i be asking be have a decision
be reach in principle to advocate
invasion

that be way off agenda karen
although it
would seem a general consensus may be
form

what make you say that

well i noted with interest the recent
comment of we colleague simon foster in
that regard
simon be texting under the desk and not really paying
full attention
he hear he name look up wave to the
group
he do not clock karens intense look that say
you be going to rebut that be not you


perhaps mr
foster would have something
to say about that

i be just
watch with interest

britain we have a say for complicate
situation such as this which be that
it be
he can not believe he be going
to say this
difficult difficult lemon difficult

he go back to he text

as i say it seem a consensus be form

that be just ridiculous
you have no basis
for saying that

you to have another hemorrhage
item one

he
do not go to chequer at the weekend for
a bit of light raping and a pub lunch
