turn lead into gold max
lead into gold
today i find it



heat be get
to euclid
feel it most in
the afternoon when i run the
set
have to keep the fan on
all night from now on
otherwise everything be
running topnotch
the stack
of s be now fast than

hundred dollar
Columbias
cost
half a million
ha

max max
can we do one

jenna
jenna

oh no

what be three hundred
and twentytwo time four
hundred and ninetyone

one hundred fiftyeight thousand
a hundred two
right

right

jenna

okay seventythree
divided by twentytwo

three point three one eight one
eight one eight



somewhere in there
somewhere
i know it be right
in front of i
the pattern
they say it be chaos it can not
be understood too much
complexity



history it be there
lurking shape
structure hide right
beneath the surface



the cycle of disease epidemic
the wax and wane of caribou population
in the arctic sunspot cycle
the rise and fall of the
nile and yes
the new york stock
exchange they be all the
same



i will find this structure
this order this perfection



turn lead into gold
the first
right here
right
here
with math
the number
of the stock market be i
lead
when i find the
pattern then i will find
gold

hello

maximilian cohen please

yeah

mr

an error in the june fifth
algorithm or Euclids
main processor be running a
recursion

oh sorry be i bother you

i will put it out
the name lenny meyer

and you be

so three it be
look forward to it

damn

max
how be you
okay

stop think max just

what do you think of hamlet

i do not get to it

it be be a month
you have not taken
a single break

i be so close sol
i be
so close but i just can not

i
named she icarus
after you
i renegade pupil
you fly
too high you will get burned

the more i see you the
more i see myself thirty
year ago
i great pupil
published at ph

at

we will see

but life be not just
mathematics
i spent forty
year looking for pattern in
pi i find nothing

you find thing

i find thing but not a
pattern



tuesday september
second eighteen twelve
if
sol have not get sick who
know where math would be
he
spend year in the number of
pi
search for meaning for
order



three point one
four
off into infinity
and maybe insanity
somewhere
in there he wanted sanity
sanity like he find in the
circle pi represent
simple sane circle
if only
the stock market have circle
some type of sanity
some
type of form of shape

hey max how you do

oh okay

lenny meyer
i will put it out
so what do you do

um i work with computer
math

really
what type of math

number theory
mostly
research

number theory
no
way i work in theory too
not traditional though
i work with the torah
amaze

yeah

yeah
you know hebrew be
all number
it be all math

hm

here look
the ancient
jew used hebrew as they
numerical system
each
letter be a number

you see
the hebrew the
number
the hebrew
bet be two
you can take any
hebrew text and turn they into
a long string of number

the torah be just
a long string of number
some say that it be a long
code send to we from god

kind of interesting

yeah like take the
hebrew word for say the
garden of eden Kadem
Kuf
Dalei mem
Kuf be a
hundred
Daled four mem
forty
they equal one hundred
and fortyfour
then take the
tree of knowledge
in
the garden Aat ha haim it
equal two hundred and
thirtythree
now you can take
that number and

they be fibonacci number

huh

the fibonacci sequence
italian mathematician thirteenth
century
if you divide
a hundred and fortyfour into
two hundred and thirtythree
it approach theta

theta

the greek symbol for the
golden ratio
the golden
spiral

you be right i never see
that before
that be the series
you find in nature
like the
face of a sunflower

wherever there be spiral

you see there be math everywhere

math everywhere

everywhere

oh i god



simple shape
tuesday september second
Twentytwentytwo
sol
sol
sol
shape in the market
why not
and they be spiral
spiral



circle spread out overtime
it be openended
it have a
begin and it grow and
change through time
if i
can find where it fit if i
can spin it and lock it into
a group of number then i
can calculate the future
lead into gold
chaos into
order madness into sanity
pain
into bliss
perfection

what the

shit

what the



wednesday september third
sevenfifteen
result

at fourteen and a halflow
very low
at six and a
halfjeez
six and a half
have not be beneath twenty in
ten year
conclusion
simple
there be no pattern
no pattern
chaos chaos all
chaos

euclid crashed
i lost
all i data i hardware

you mainframe

burn

what happen

i do not know first i get
these horrible pick
then
euclid spit out some
number
never see anything
like it and then it fry
the whole machine just
crashed

you have a printout

of

the pick the number

i threw it out

what be the number it
spit out

i do not know just a long
string of digit

how many

i do not know

what be it a
hundred and fifty a
thousand two hundred
sixteen
how many

i do not know
probably
around two hundred
why

i deal with
some bug back in i pi day
i be wonder if it be
similar to one i run into

have you meet archimedes
the one with the black spot
you see

yeah

remember archimedes of
syracuse
the king ask
archimedes to determine if a
present he be received be
actually solid gold
unsolved
problem at the time
it
torture the great greek
mathematician for week
insomnia haunt he and he
twist and turn on he bed
for night on end
finally
he equally exhaust wife
she be forced to share a bed
with this genius convince
he to take a bath to relax
while step into the tub
he observe the bathwater
rise as he enter
displacement
way to determine volume
and thus a way to
determine density weight
over volume
and thus
archimedes solve the
problem
he scream
eureka
greek for i find
it
and be so overwhelmed he
run dripping naked through
the street to the king
castle to report his
discovery
now what be the
moral of the story

that a breakthrough will
come

wrong
the point of the
story be the wife
listen to
you wife she will give you
perspective
meaning you
need a break max you have
to take a bath otherwise
you will get nowhere
there will
be no order only chaos
go home and take a bath

hey excuse i can i see
that

six and a half

fourteen and a half
oh
i

i god
i god
yes
yes



hey paper please

mr
cohen
perfect time

on the nose
on the damn nose



Farrouhk

um no it be max from next door

max be everything all
right

do you have any iodine

iodine
do you cut
yourself

no
i just need it to stain a
slide

ah science the pursuit
of knowledge
one second



here we be
what be you
examining
a potato

just something with i
computer



the neighbor up
to he old science



what neighbor



next door



why be you talking to that dork



shh
i just helped



pound on wall
hey dork leave
i girlfriend alone



Farrouhk

shh
baby
come here baby

i just threw out something
i do not realize i needed it


humph

just a printout
i uh
lost i data

max
how you do
lenny
meyer

oh hey

hey where you going
you
get a few moment to do Tefillin

i get to car we can cruise
over to i

you get to car

yeah right there
that be
ephraim i friend

all tight let we go

great

lenny i do not really
want to do

do it for i
it
mean a lot have someone
of you stature performing a
mitzvah in i presence
when you told i you name be
max cohen i do not realize you
be the max cohen
maximilian cohen

you know i

f course i have
follow you research since
you columbia day
it be
revolutionary
you have inspired
the work we do

i have

yes very much
so
the only difference be
we be not looking at stock
we be searching for a pattern
in torah

what kind of pattern

we be not really
sure
we calculation have
show we that there be a
number encoded in the text

what sort of number

we do not know
all we know be that it be two
hundred and sixteen digit long

do not worry
this one just
go over you head

two sixteen

yes
now we have to say a
small prayer repeat
after i

that be it
be not
so bad be it
you feel
anything

what be it

it be a prayer about we
dedication to we one and
only god

no i mean the number the
two sixteen number
what be
it

oh
we do not know
we just
know that it be the most
common number encoded in
the text
it might be some
type of linguistic pattern
if we could figure out what
the number be we could maybe
answer that

tell i more

max

what be going on sol

relax it be early

now what be up

what be the two hundred
and sixteen number sol

excuse i

you ask i if i have
see a two hundred and
sixteen digit number right

oh you mean the bug
i
find it working on pi

what do you mean by find it

what be this all about
max

well there be these
religious jew who have

religious jew

well you know
Hassidim
i meet one in the
coffee shop
the guy a
number theorist
the torah be
they data set
the thing be
they be searching for a two
hundred and sixteen digit
number in the torah

really
what be it mean to
they

they say they do not
know but that be crazy
i
mean what be the odds

it be just a coincidence

but hold on there be
something else
you remember
those strange pick i get

yesterday stock pick

right
well it turn out
that they be correct
i hit
two pick on the nose
smack
on the nose

hmmm

something going on and
it have to do with that
number
the answer be there

max it be a bug

no
it be a pattern

pattern be in that number

come with i

listen to i
the ancient
japanese considered the go
board to be a microcosm of
the universe
although when
it be empty it appear to be
simple and ordered in fact
the possibility of game play
be endless
they say that no
two go game have ever be
alike
just like snowflake
so the go board actually
represent an extremely complex
and chaotic universe
that be
the truth of we world max
it can not be easily sum up
with math
there be no simple
pattern

but as a go game
progress the possibility
become small and small
the board do take on order
soon all move be
predictable

so

so maybe even though we be not
sophisticated enough to be aware
of it there be an underlie
order
a pattern beneath every
go game
maybe that pattern be
like the pattern in the market
in the torah
the two sixteen
number

that be insanity max

or maybe it be genius
i
have to get that number

hold on you have to slow
down
you be losing it you
have to take a breath
listen
to yourself
you be connecting
a computer bug i have a
computer bug you might have
have and some religious
hogwash
if you want to find
the number two sixteen in the
world you will be able to pull
it out of anywhere
two
hundred and sixteen step
from you street comer to
you front door
two hundred
and sixteen second you spend
riding on the elevator
when
you mind become obsess
with anything it will filter
everything else out and find
example of that thing
everywhere
three hundred and
twenty four hundred and
fifty twentythree
whatever
you have chosen two
sixteen and you will find it
everywhere in nature
but
max as soon as you discard
scientific rigor you be no
longer a mathematician
you
become a numerologist
what
you need to do be take a
break from you research
you
need it
you deserve it
here a hundred dollar i
want you to take it
if you
will not take it borrow it
either way take a break
spend it however you like as
long as it fall in the
category of vacation
real
world stuff okay
no math

just try it
in a week
you will laugh about this
mon max
think about it

mr
cohen
mr
cohen
please stop for a
second mr
cohen

damn it already
stop
following i
i be not
interest in you money
i be
searching for a way to
understand we world
i be
searching for perfection
i
do not deal with mediocre
materialistic people like
you

i be sorry
i be very sorry
i admit i have be a bit too
aggressive
but all i ask be
for five minute of you time
here

a stopwatch
already ticking
allow i the
four and a half minute left
let i tell you what i want
let i tell you what i can
offer you
afterwards if you
do not want to talk to i then
fine we part as friend and
i promise that you will never
see i again
that be fair
be not it

go

good
it be funny
even though we have different
aim and different goal
we be actually incredibly
alike
we both seek the same
thingperfection
i know
clearly we be seeking
different type of
perfection but that be what
make we perfect candidate
for a fruitful partnership
if you let i i can be you
great ally
take the
acacia tree
in east
africa
it be the most
prevalent plant in all of
kenya because it have managed
to secure it niche by
defeating it major predator
the giraffe
to accomplish
this the tree have make a contract
with a highly specialize red ant
the tree have evolved giant spore which
act as house for the ant
in return for shelter the
ant supply defense
when a
giraffe start to eat the
tree leaf the shake
branch act like an alarm
the
ant charge out and secrete an
acid onto the giraffe
tongue
the giraffe learn it
lesson and never return
without each other the tree
would be pick dry and the
ant would have no shade from
the brutal african sun both
would die
but with each
other they succeed they survive
they surpass
they have
different aim different
goal but they work together
max we would like to establish
a mutually benefiting alliance
with you

i be not interest

allow i to dose

as a sign of good faith we
wish to offer you this

i told you i do not want money

the suitcase be not filled with
fifties or gold or diamond
just
silicon
ming mecca chip

yeah right

ming mecca
they be not declassify

you be right
they be not
but
LancetPercy have many friend
come here take a look

what do
do

beautiful be not it
you know
how rare
be you okay

yeah i get to go

but what about

let i think about it

what
mr
cohen

hey

up buddy coney island last stop

you nose

max max can we do one

jenna
i can not now jenna

please max

i be working now later okay

hello this be lenny

lenny it be max cohen

max
how be you
you want to come down

i have be think about
we conversation early

that be good

i want to help

excellent

do you have the torah in
digital form



thursday september
fourth sixteen fortyfive
the alchemist awake
all of
i idea work and dream be
spinning together it all have
to do with spiral
it begin
with spiral and the answer
be thou



the most i can
remember about they
significance be from
Schneiders class
that
bullshit core for major
Schneiders fascination with
mystical geometry make he a
bit of a quack
but
then again
look at kepler
he be really into
pythagoras
the leader of an
ancient sect which believe
the entire universe could be
represent by number
pythagoras great contribution
be the golden ratio which end up
influence art and science
for thousands of year
arguably all the way up to
today



the golden ratio
if i recall be this unique
relationship between the length
and width of a special
rectangle called the golden
rectangle



if you take the
width of this rectangle and
use it to form a square within
the rectangle the part left
over be a rectangle that have
the same ratio as the
original rectangle
au can
continue squaring the
rectangle over and over
again making the
rectangle small and small
to infinity



then if you
connect a curve through these
rectangle you get the golden
spiral
the pythagorean
loved this shape because
they find it everywhere
in nature



it really be amazing
in the sea
on land in air we basic build
block and even we home



if we be build from
spiral while living within
a giant spiral be it
possible that all of human
behavior if it could be
quantified be in the form of
a spiral
then maybe
extension of we behavior
like the stock market
maybe
even the write of the
torah be infuse with the
spiral pattern



friday september
fifth
