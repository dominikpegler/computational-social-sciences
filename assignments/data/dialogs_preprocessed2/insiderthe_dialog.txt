what do you want to see i about
i
do not like be back here

jeffrey say exactly what be on he mind
most people consider what they be
saying
social skill
jeffrey just
charge right ahead
now i know you understood the nature of
the confidentiality portion of you
severance agreement with brown
williamson jeff

chapter and verse

yeah i know you do
you know i come up through sales
one
of the reason i be a great salesman
be i never make a promise i could not
keep
i know that if i ever broke i promise
i would suffer the consequence

be that a threat

we worked together for what be it
three year
now the work we do here be
confidential not for public
scrutiny
any more than be one family
matter

you threatening i family now too

now do not be paranoid jeff
about the direction of research here we
may have have we difference of
opinion

research

you declare as a badge of honor you
do not even know what make water boil

that be why we hire scientist

okay
i do not believe you can maintain
corporate integrity without
confidentiality agreement
i be paid
well for i work
the health and welfare
benefit be good
the severance package
be fair
i have no intention of
violate i confidentiality agreement
and disclose that which i said i
would not

i appreciate all that jeff
but upon
reflection
we have decided to expand we
zone of comfort with you

so we have drafted a supplement to you
agreement
it broadly define and
expand in more detail what be
confidential
nobody will be able to
say well hello bell margaret i
do not know that be a secret

we be very serious about protecting we
interest
we would like you to sign it

and if i do not

if we arrive at the conclusion you be
acting in bad faith
we would terminate
right now payout under you severance
package
you and you family medical
benefit
and initiate litigation
against you mr
Wigand

dr
Wigand

dr
Wigand
after you have examine the
document you will see it be in you own
good interest and you will sign it

so what you be saying be
it be not
enough that you fired i
for no good
reason
now you question i integrity
on top of the humiliation of be fired
you threaten i
you threaten i
family
it never crossed i mind not to honor i
agreement
but i will tell you mr
Sandefur and
brown williamson too

the bottom line
turning to
look at lowell in the rear
seat
so i left they a message this morning
they expand confidentiality agreement
i will sign it

they be afraid of you be not they

they should be

after a beat trying to make
it easier for he
talk to i outside the zone of you
agreement

like what

like where do you work before brown
williamson

johnson johnson
union carbide in
japan
i be general manager and
director of new product
i speak
japanese
i be a director of corporate
development at pfizer
all health
relate
what else
outside the zone

i do not know
you think the knick be
going to make it through the semifinal


just give i an example

for example
james burke the of
johnson johnson
when he find out
that some lunatic have put poison in
Tylenol bottle he do not
argue
with the

he do not even
wait
for the
to tell he
he just pulled Tylenol off
every shelf of every store right across
america
instantly
and then he
developed the safety cap
because
look as a sure he be get to be a
great businessman right
but he be also
a man of science
he be not going to
allow he company
to put on the
shelf
a product that might hurt people
not like the seven dwarf

seven dwarf

the seven ceo of big tobacco
they get
up in front of congress that time
it
be on television

and swear under oath that they know
nothing about addiction disease

it be on
yeah

okay so here you be
you go to work
for tobacco
you come from corporate culture where
research really creative think
these be core value
you go to
tobacco
tobacco be a sales culture
market and sell enormous volume
go to a
lot of golf tournament
the hell with
everything else
what be you do
why be you working
for tobacco in the first place

i can not talk about it
the work i be
suppose to do
might have have some
positive effect
i do not know
it could
have be beneficial
mostly i get paid a lot
i take the
money
i wife be happy
i kid have
good medical
good school
get a
great house
i mean what the hell be wrong with
that

nothing wrong with that
that be it
you be making money
you be provide
for you family
what could be wrong
with that

i have always think of myself
as a man
of science
that be what be wrong with it

then
you be in a state of conflict
jeff

because look here how it lay out
if
you get vital insider stuff the american
people for they welfare really
do
need
to know
and you feel impel to
disclose it and violate you agreement in
do so that be one thing
on the other
hand if you want to honor this
agreement then that be simple
you do
so
you say nothing
you do nothing
there be only one guy who can figure that
out for you
and that be you
all by
yourself
too
evenhand
as Wigand

i have get to go pick up the girl
they
only have half a day

he refer to this
the seven dwarf

what seven dwarf


the seven ceo of big tobacco
refer
to this
say they
should
be afraid of
he
i assume afraid of what he could
reveal
now you tell i
what do this guy
have to say that threaten these people

well it be not cigarette be bad for
you

hardly new news

no shit

what be this

re
video
what that be be tobaccoes standard
defense
it be the we do not know
litany
addiction
we
believe
not
disease
we do not know
we take a bunch
of leave roll they together
you smoke
they
after that
you be on you own
we do not know

so
tell i nothing
besides you will never get what he be get

why not

because of this guy confidentiality
agreement he be never going to be able to
talk to you

that be not good enough
this guy be the
top scientist in the number three tobacco
company in america
he be a corporate
officer
you
never
get whistleblower
from fortune company
this guy be
the ultimate insider
he be get something
to say
he want to say it
i want it on
minute


do not matter what he
want

be i missing something here

what do you mean mike

he be get a corporate secrecy agreement
give i a break
this be a publichealth
issue like an unsafe airframe on a
passenger jet or
some company dump
cyanide into the east river
issue like
that
he can talk we can air it
they have get no right to hide behind a
corporate agreement
re
he coffee
pass the milk

they do not need the right
they have get
the money

the unlimited checkbook
that be how big
tobacco win every time
on everything
they spend you to death
million a
year in outside legal
ChadbourneParke
ken Starrs firm kirkland and ellis
listen
and ford they get nail
after or pickup blow up
right
these clown have never
i mean ever

not even once

not even with hundreds of thousands
dying each year from an illness related
to they product
have
ever
lost a
personalinjury lawsuit
on this case
they will issue gag order sue for breach
anticipatory breach enjoin he you we
he pet dog the doge veterinarian
tie he up in litigation for ten of
fifteen year
i be telling you they bat
a thousand
every time
he know that
that be why he be not going to talk to you

okay let we look through the look
glass the other way

what do you mean

we get a guy
who want to talk but he be
constrained
what if he be compel

oh torture
great rating

what do you mean compel

i mean compel by a justice department
state court be a witness
that would
cut through any confidentiality
agreement would not it

yeah

what do that do

what do you mean what be it do

what i mean be like how do it cut
through the confidentiality agreement

because he have to reveal it in a court of
law
it be on record it be out
it be no
secret anymore
so how can they restrain
he speech or retaliate
it be out in the
world

if you could engineer it into the court
record you might have something
they
would have a helluva time trying to
restrain he speech then would not they

yeah but what venue
and where do he
get do he have killer attorney

i do not think he be get any attorney

he be going to need attorney who be not
afraid of risking year of litigation
and millions of dollar of they
own
dough in legal cost

what do you say mike
what do you
think

even if he get the defense team will he
go for it


you be awfully overqualify dr
Wigand

i be trying to
start a new career
i
believe i could be a good teacher


let i give it some think

and not a lot of company in the
healthcare field hire extobacco
scientist

that be it

that be where we baby be born
debbie take she first step right
there
in the grass

i do not plan on this

you do not tell she we be taping
what do she think she be coming to new

to think about it
i have a plan to ease she into it
but i
really i do not know how to do that

oh man

who
be
these people

ordinary people
under
extraordinary
pressure mike
what the hell do you
expect
grace and consistency

you hear mr
Sandefur say before
congress that he
believe
nicotine be
not
addictive

i believe mr
Sandefur perjure
himself because i watch those
testimony very carefully

all of we do
there be this whole
line
of people
whole line of ceo up there
all swearing

part of the reason i be here be i feel
that they representation clearly
misstate at least within brown
williamsons representation clearly
misstate
what be common language
within the company
we be in the
nicotine delivery business

and that be what cigarette be for

delivery device for nicotine

delivery device for nicotine
put it
in you mouth light it up and you be
going to get you fix

you be going to get you fix

you be saying that brown williamson
manipulate and adjust the nicotine fix
not by artificially add nicotine but
by enhance the effect of nicotine
through the use of chemical element such
as ammonia

the process be known as impact
boosting
while not spiking nicotine
they clearly manipulate it
there be
extensive use of this technology know
as ammonia chemistry
it allow for
the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed
in the lung and therefore affect the
brain and central nervous system

the straw that broke the camel back for
i and really put i in trouble with
Sandefur be a compound called
coumarin
when i come on board at
they have tried to transition from
coumarin to a similar flavor that would
give the same taste and have be
unsuccessful
i wanted it out
immediately
i be tell that it would affect sales so
i should mind i own business
i
constructed a memo to mr
Sandefur
indicate i could not in conscience
continue with coumarin in a product that
we now know we have documentation be
similar to coumadin a lungspecific
carcinogen

and you send the document forward to
Sandefur

i send the document forward to Sandefur
i be tell that we would continue to work
on a substitute we be not going to
remove it as it would impact sales and
that that be he decision

in other word you be charging
Sandefur and brown williamson with
ignore health consideration
consciously

most certainly

and on march thomas Sandefur of
brown williamson have you fired
and
the reason he give you

poor communication skill

and do you wish you have not come forward
you wish you have not blown the whistle

yeah there be time i wish i have not
do it
there be time i feel
compel to do it
if you ask i
would i do it again
do i think it be
worth it
yeah i think it be worth it

perilous effect to the kentucky gag

that be right
if you violate the
kentucky order when you step foot back
in kentucky they can find you in

possible consequence of you testify

hold on a second
seeing motley enter
to jr
lawyer
would you please ask mr
motley if he
expect he witness to appear or not

i can not seem to find
the criterion to
decide
it be too big a decision to make
without be resolved
in i own mind

maybe thing have changed

what be changed

you mean
since this morning

no
i mean since whenever

fuck it
let we go to court

dr

to give they a chance to get another
restrain order okay
let we go

good luck doc

please stand
raise you right hand
do you swear to tell the truth the whole
truth and nothing but the truth so help
you god

i do

you may be seated

you understand dr
Wigand you be under
oath
this be a swear deposition
there be no judge
it be not a trial
will you state you name for the record

jeffrey
Wigand

get any idea what be going on in there

no i do not have a clue

that be correct

in other word it act as a drug

object to the form of the question

it act as a drug on the body

object to the form

it act as a

object

there an echo in here
you objection
be recorded
she type it into she
little machine over there
it be on the
record
so now i will proceed with i
deposition of
i
witness
do it act as
a drug

dr
Wigand
i be instructing
you
not
to answer that question in
accordance to the term of the
contractual obligation undertake by you
not to disclose any information about
you work at the brown williamson
tobacco company
and in accordance with
the force and effect of the temporary
restrain order that have be enter
against
you to by the court in the state of
kentucky
that mean you do not talk
mr
motley we have right here

oh you get right
and
left
up and
down and middle
so what
you do not
get to instruct
anything
around here
this be not north carolina not south
carolina nor
kentucky
this be the
sovereign state of
mississippi
s
proceeding
wipe that smirk off you
face
dr
Wigands deposition
will
be
part of this record
and i be going to
take i witness testimony
whether the
hell you like it or not
answer the question dr

yes
it produce a physiological
response which meet the definition of a
drug
nicotine be associated with
impact with satisfaction
it have a
pharmacological effect that cross the
bloodbrain barrier intact

thank you doctor
thank you

part of the reason i be here be i feel
that they representation clearly at
least within


run that Sandefur piece on nicotines
not addictive
run that oncamera
then cut right to Wigand with i believe
they perjure
then go wide to the
ceo all taking the oath
back on jeff
and play the pause after the word feel
on the Bside
hot
show and it be generated excitement

helluva show mike
explosive
material

it go great in mississippi mike

good

i hear Wigands deposition get seal

yeah they argued he be going to reveal
the secret formula of Kools to the
world
seal do not hurt Scruggs
litigation and since we be the only one
with the story i believe we be sitting
on an exclusive

i like
that

corporate have some question
we have get
a meet at black rock first thing in
the morning

when be the air date

excuse i lowell
sharons on line

tell she i will call she back in ten

here we go
misstate
what they commonly know

shall i send for coffee
sorry i be late

no no we be fine

be you sure

alright i think we would get together
because there be a legal concept that have
be get some new attention recently
tortious interference

if two people have an agreement like a
confidentiality agreement and one of
they break it because they be induced
to do so by a rd party the rd party
can be sue for damage for
interfering
hence tortious
interference


interfere
that be what we do

i think what we be trying to tell you be
that it happen all the time
this be a
news organization
people be always
telling we thing they should not
we
have to verify if it be true and in the
public interest
and if it be we air
it

after we corroborate it
that be why
we have never lost a lawsuit and run a
classy show
anything else

and
minute verification
be
exact
and
precise
and
i do not think it would
hurt to make
sure
you be right
on this
one

why
you think we have liability
what be the news position eric

there be a possibility it be rather
remote

but one we have to check on mike
i have
retain outside counsel to do exactly
that
on a segment i might add that be
already rife with problem

what do that mean
rife with


i be tell unusual promise be make to
Wigand

no only that we would hold the story
until it be safe for he

and i be tell there be question as to
we star witness veracity

he veracity be good enough for the
state of mississippi

we standard have to be high than
anyone else because we
be
the
standard
for
everyone else

well as a standard
i will hang with
be the guy telling the truth


well with tortious interference i be
afraid
the great the truth the
great the damage

come again

they
own
the information he be disclose
the true it be the great the damage
to they
if he lie he do not disclose
they
information
and the damage be
small

be this alice in wonderland

you said on this one
what about this
one

if this hold up and it very well may
not mike
but if it do
and we air
this segment
and be sue by brown
williamson
i think we could be at
grave risk

how grace

and she be be waiting for
this
well at the end of the day
because of
you segment
the brown williamson
tobacco company
could
own


you know i be sorry
but i be due
upstairs

be corporate tell news do not
go to air with this story

you be get ahead of yourself
we be
all
in this together
we be
all

we will find out soon
thank you
gentleman

tortious interference
sound like a
disease catch by a radio

lunch

sure
do not worry we call the shot around
here

hello

debbie it be i
i want you to check
some filing and give i john wilsons
number at BearStern

what now

Klusters coming over

hello lowell mike don

there have be so much soul searching
about this Wigand i have decided we should
cut an alternate version of the show
without
he interview

so what happen to ms
Caperellis
checking with outside counsel first all
that crap

that be happening
and hopefully we
will not have to use the alternate but we
should have it in the can

i be not touching i film

i be afraid you be

no i be not

we be do this with or without you
lowell
if you like i can assign
another producer to edit you show

since when have the paragon of
investigative journalism allow lawyer
to determine the news content on
minute

it be an alternate version
so what if we
have an alternate version
and i do not
think she be cautious be so damn
unreasonable

so now if you will excuse i gentleman
mr
Rathers be complaining about his
chair again

before you go

i discovered this
file
for the sale of the corporation to
westinghouse corporation

what

yeah i hear rumor

it be not a rumor
it be a sale
if tisch can unload for a share
to westinghouse and then be suddenly
threatened with a multibilliondollar
lawsuit from brown williamson that
could screw up the sale could it not

and what be you imply

i be not imply
i be quoting
more
vest interest
person who will profit from this
merger
ms
helen Caperelli general counsel of
news
million
mr
eric Kluster
president of news
million


be you suggest that she and eric be
influence by money

oh no of course they be not influence
by money
they work for free
and you
be a volunteer executive producer

do not do that
and you be
questioning we journalistic integrity

no i be questioning you hear
you
hear reasonable and tortious
interference
i hear
potential
brown williamson lawsuit jeopardize
the sale of to westinghouse
i
hear
shut the segment down
cut
Wigand loose
obey order
and fuck
off
that be what i hear

you be exaggerate

the key witness in the
big
public

mostexpensive corporatemalfeasance case
in you

history
and jeffrey Wigand

be we going to air
it
of course not
why
because he be
not telling the truth

not going to air it
and the more truth

critic

it quote richard Scruggs calling it the
bad kind of an organized smear campaign
against a whistleblower



a close look at the file and
independent research by this newspaper
into it key claim indicate that many
of the serious allegation against mr
Wigand be backed by scant or
contradictory evidence


the news division have be vilify in
the new york time
in print on
television for caving to corporate
interest

the new york time
run a blow by blow of
what we talk about behind close door

capitalist sentiment refute big
tobacco smear campaign as the low
form of character assassination
