
screenplay by
philip eisner




i miss you



this be weir



dr
weir admiral hollis would like
to see you as soon as possible


you wanted to see i admiral

i apologize for the short notice
bill but we have have something come
up that require you immediate
attention
lyle

at ohthreehundred this morning
picked up an automate
navigation beacon broadcasting at
two minute interval in neptune orbit

incredible
these be the same
coordinate before the ship
disappeared
this this happen
this be not some kind of hoax

i would not bring you here on a hoax
houston confirm the telemetry and
i

code

it be the event horizon
she be come
back

that ship be lost in deep space
seven year ago
if the titanic sail
into new york harbor i would find it
more plausible
houston want aerospace to send out
a search and rescue team investigate
the source of the transmission
if
it really be the event horizon
they will attempt a salvage
we need you to prepare a detail
briefing on the ship system for
the salvage crew

written brief can not possibly
anticipate the variable on a mission
like this
i have to go with they

dr
weir you have no experience
with salvage procedure

i design the ship propulsion
system
i be the only person capable
of evaluating the performance of the
gravity drive
you can not send a search
and rescue team out there alone and
expect they to succeed
that would
be like
like sending an auto
mechanic to work on the shuttle

i can understand you desire to redeem
you reputation dr
weir but it
do not factor into this

this be not about i reputation
this be not about i at all
the event horizon be created for
one reason
to go fast than light
imagine mankind exploring new solar
system colonizing new world
seven
year ago we do not just lose the
ship and the crew
we lost the dream
beat quiet and
relentless
i have to go

it be not that simple
off of weir
expression
lyle play the recording for dr
weir

navigation control tried to hail the
vessel
this be the only response

since the initial transmission
there be be no far contact
just the beacon every two minute

the crew
could they still be alive

the ship have life support system
for eighteen month
they be be
go seven year

someone send that message
admiral
you have to put i on that ship

it be against i good judgement
but i will run this by the man
downstairs
you will know i decision
by the end of the day

thank you

do not thank i bill
i be not do
you any favor

you be not seriously consider
sending he

you do not just dismiss bill weir
the man hold Oppenheimers chair at
princeton
if the event horizon have
worked he would have go down in
history as the great mind in
physics since einstein

the official inquiry blame weirs
design for the ship loss

that do not mean a damn thing
they
be looking for a scapegoat and
weir fit the bill
but he be not
responsible for what happen to the
ship

do he know that

what be on you mind

he do not belong on this mission
responsible or not he blame himself
he be too close to it
and then there be he wife

it be be two year since she die
he be over it

some thing you do not get over

i want we good people on this
where be miller

the lewis and clark just return
from patrol in the asteroid belt
she be docked in bay four


i can not believe this i have not get
more than i hand in six week and
now this shit
why not mars cap
mars have woman

smiths right
neptune
there be
nothing out there
if something
happen we will be on we own

i do not like it either but you know
the rule
we get the call we go
be the course locked in

lock and cocked

we be past the outer marker we can
engage the ion drive whenever you be
ready

justin

everything green on i board
skipper

start the countdown

ion drive will engage in
Tminus
ten minute

let we go

kill it

time to play spam in the can

do not start with i cooper

captain miller i just want to say

the clock be running dr
weir
if
you will follow the rest of the crew
they will show you to the gravity tank

what be the hold up

just loading the last of the
scrubber
good for four month

i put in for a replacement for you
but no one

no no it alright
i talk to i
ex he will keep denny over christmas
and i will get he this summer
goddam it skipper
i have not see
he in two month

i be sorry
but now we have to go to
work


be that an offer

it be not

captain miller i appreciate this
opportunity

doctor weir i crew be not going on
you mission because we want to
we
be pull off a well deserve leave
to be send out to the middle of
nowhere and no one even told we
why

i have be authorized to brief you
and the crew once we reach neptune
space

until then do what you be tell and
stay out of i way

first time in a grav couch

yes

do not worry about it
he be hard but
he be fair
you be lucky to be shipping
out with he
he be one of the few
captain in the service with
experience in the outer reach

he be be past mars

he serve on the goliath

be not that ship destroyed

they attempted to rescue a supply
shuttle bound for titan
the shuttle
ohtwo tank rupture during the
rescue flood both ship with pure
oxygen
there be a spark and both
ship be incinerate
the skipper
and three other just make it to a
lifeboat
captain miller be able

he do not like to talk about it

you do not eat anything in the past
twelve hour

when the ion drive fire we will be
taking about gees
without a tank
the force would liquefy you skeleton

i have see the effect on mouse

five minute

put this on

you will be fine
you will wake up and
we will be there
watch you finger

heartrate decrease
body temp
dropping to



degree fahrenheit
he be in stasis



billy

i be so cold

i be so cold

claire

claire
i be sorry
claire

i be so cold



claire


it be okay
you be okay
just breathe

i be alright now
i be alright

move slowly
you have be in stasis
for fiftysix day
you be going to
experience a little disorientation

damn dr
weir do not scare we like
that
coffee

what

coffee

no thank you

hey starck
you want to dry i back

maybe when you finish puberty

starck why be not you on the bridge

i just finished drying

then what be you do here
come
on people let we go
and cooper
put some pants on


play horsey mommy play horsey

want to play horsey do you
etc


hour to neptune orbit

all board be green everything
five by five

that be good to know
justin you
want to stow that

okay listen up
as you all know by
now we have an addition to we crew
dr
weir this be
starck navigation
smith pilot justin ship engineer

you can call he Babybear he love
that

this be cooper what the hell do you
do on this ship anyway

ballast

i be you good friend
i be a
lifesaver and a heartbreaker

he be a rescue technician
peters
medical technician


trauma

and this be mission specialist dr
william weir
we all know where we be
going
dr
weir be going to tell we
why

what i be about to tell you be
considered codeblack by the

that mean topsecret cooper

i hear it

the intercepted a radio
transmission from a decay orbit
around neptune
the source have be
identified as the event horizon

that be impossible
she be lost with
all hand what seven

seven year ago the reactor blow

how can we salvage

let the dead rest man

cancel we leave and send we out
on some bullshit mission


let the man speak

what be make public about the event
horizon that she be a deep space
research vessel that it reactor
go critical that the ship blow
up
none of that be true
the event horizon be the culmination
of a secret government project to
create a spacecraft capable of fast
thanlight flight

you can not do that

the law of relativity prohibit fast
thanlight travel

relativity yes
we can not break the
law of relativity but we can go
around it
the ship do not really
move fast than the speed of light
it create a dimensional gateway
that allow the ship to
instantaneously jump from one point
in the universe to another light
year away

how

well in layman term you use a
rotate magnetic field to focus a
narrow beam of graviton
these in
turn fold spacetime consistent with
weyl tensor dynamics until the space
time curvature become infinitely
large and you have a singularity

Laymens term

hey

say this paper represent spacetime
and you want to get from point
here
mark it on the photo
with a pen
to point here
now
what be the short distance
between two point

straight line

wrong
the short distance between
two point

be zero
that be what the
singularity do
it fold space so
that point and point coexist in
the same space and time
after the
ship pass through this gateway
space return to normal
hand the ruine pin
up back to smith
it be called a gravity drive

how do you know all this

i build it

i can see why they send you along

so if the ship do not blow up what
happen

it be the ship maiden voyage to
test the drive
the event horizon
moved to safe distance use ion
thruster
they received the goahead
to activate the gravity drive
and the ship vanished from all we
scope
no radar contact no enhanced
optical no radio contact of any
kind
they disappeared without a
trace
until now

where have it be for the last seven
year

that be what we be here to find out


we have not be able to confirm any
live contact but do receive
a single transmission from the event
horizon

what the hell be that

it do not sound like anything human

houston have passed the recording
through several filter and isolate
what appear to be a human voice

jesus

what be that

it sound like latin

latin
who the fuck speak latin

no one
it be a dead language

mostly dead

what do it say

encryption specialist have
decipher some of the message

there

liberatis i
they
have not be able to translate the
rest it be too distort

Liberatis i
save i


from what

you be convince the crew could still
be alive
after seven year

the event horizon only have life
support for eighteen month
it seem
impossible but in light of the
transmission
i have to think that
someone have managed to endure until
now

skipper do we get hazard pay for
this

you hear the tape smith
we be
looking for survivor


crossing the horizon
optimum approach
angle be fourteen degree

come around to threethreefour

head threethreefour

make you approach vector negative
fourteen degree

Onefour degree

we have a lock on the event horizon
navigation beacon
it be in the upper
ionosphere we be in for some chop

bring we in tight
starck get on
the horn see if anyone listening

this be you

aerospace command vessel
lewis and clark hail event
horizon event horizon do you
read
this be the lewis and clark
hail
she continue



match speed
now
range to target
ten thousand meter and closing
skipper i get a bad feel about
this

we be all on edge smith
we be a
long way out

that be not it
that ship be build
to go fast than light
that be
just wrong it go against everything
we know

what be you trying to say
if god
have intended man to fly he would
have given we wing


something like that yeah

i guess we be about to find out
keep we slow and steady

yes sir

dr
weir

i think you want to see this

where be she

dead ahead meter

we have get some weather

i notice
starck anybody home

if they be they be screening they
call

range meter and closing

i can not see anything

meter
we be get too
close

where be it

the scope be light it be right in front
of we

meter

proximity warn
meter

we be right on top of it
we be going to hit

starck

it should be right there

i god

reverse thruster full

jesus that be one big ugly fat
fucker

she be not ugly

range meter and holding
turbulence be dropping off

pick up magnetic interference

put it through
smith you up
for a flyby

love to

look at the size of that thing

Foredecks
crew quarter bridge
medical and science lab hydroponics
what have you
that central section
connect the forward deck to the
engineering containment area
can we
move in closer

shit doc any close and we be going to
need a rubber

do it

that be the engineering containment
and there be the main airlock
we can
dock there

smith use the arm and lock we onto
that antennae cluster

be careful
it be not a load bear
structure

it be now
we be locked in

starck give i a read

the reactor still hot
we have get
several small radiation source
leak probably
nothing serious

do they have pressure

affirmative
the hullos intact
but there be no gravity and the thermal
unit be off line
i be showing deep
cold
the crew could not survive unless
they be in stasis

find they starck

something wrong with the bioscan

radiation interference

there be not enough radiation to throw
off the scan
i be picking up trace
life form but i can not get a lock
on the location

could it be the crew
if they be
in suspend animation would not
that effect the scan

if they be in stasis i would get a
location but these reading they be
all over the ship
it do not make
any sense

okay
we do it the hard way
deck by
deck room by room
starck deploy
the umbilicus
i believe you be up
for a walk mr
justin
go get you
bonnet on

yes sir

dr
weir i need you on the bridge

captain i do not come out here to
sit on you bridge i need to be on
that ship

once the ship be secured we will bring
you on board

that be not acceptable

once we have secured the ship that be
the way it be
i need you to guide we from the comm
station
this be where i need you
help we to do we job

very well


come on skipper i already put
i shoe on

you have have plenty coop it be
Justins turn
stay on station
if
anything happen

i will be all over it

open inner airlock door

you still need the rope
i think
you be one a those spaceman with
ice in you vein

i would rather be on the rope and not
need it than need it and not have
it
now step aside old man

you just keep you nose clean baby
bear
clear the door

you have reach the outer airlock
door

we have get pressure

clear and open on i mark
three
two
one
mark


jesus it huge

ice crystal everywhere
this place
be a deep freeze



you be in the central corridor
it
connect the personnel area to
engineering

peters and i will search the forward
deck
justin take engineering
no
hotdogging not on this one alright

not a chance sir

dr
weir what be this

ahead at the next
couple
here another one
they be all over
the place



they be explosive charge

i can see that what be they for

in an emergency the charge detonate
in series destroy the central
section and separating the personnel
area from the rest of the ship
that way if the gravity drive
malfunction the crew could use the
foredecks as a lifeboat

that mean they do not abandon ship

so where be they
starck any luck
with the bioscan

i be running diagnostics now
skipper
nothing wrong with the
sensor pack i be still get trace
life reading all over the ship

there be no one in the corridor but
we



not accord to the computer

peters be right no one here

i do not know this place be really
dark i can not see a thing

easy peters we be okay we be okay
let we finish the sweep



captain miller the foredecks be
just ahead

i can see the hatch

starck you still showing those
reading



that be an affirmative

keep you eye open

we find the gravity couch

any survivor



negative

no one

they be empty dr
weir
moving
forward



you have reach the first containment
seal
the engineering deck be on
the other side

we still have pressure
the radiation
count steady at millirads an
hour



background radiation
perfectly safe

dr
weir what be this the door to



you be at the bridge ms
peters
you still have not see any crew

if we see any crew doctor you would
know about it
i be in medical
no casualty it
look like this place have never be
used

i find something

yes we can see some kind of mist
what be that



blood
look like arterial spray

can you see a body

there be no one here



the blood come from somewhere
peters

there be no one here skipper

come on

okay
i be on the bridge



what you get peters

Everythings be shut down
conserve power i guess
green
light on the hull it be intact

the science workstation have power
i will see if i can find the crew from
here

ms
peters turn back and to you
left please

what be it

ship log



i see it

it be stick

i have reach another containment
door
this thing huge



that be the second containment seal
beyond that engineering

i be going in

it be really jammed in there

i find one



alive

freeze

what happen to he eye

explosive decompression

decompression would not do that

you okay

hey baby bear mama bear get a
corpsicle for you



baby bear you copy

justin do you copy



do you copy

uh yeah coop i be still here



shit
do not do that
where the fuck
be you

i be in the second containment area
it be pitch black in here
there must
have be a coolant leak
man this
shit be everywhere
i can not see a
damn thing

the reactor still hot
coolant
level be on reserve but still in
the green

i get it

holy shit

justin

i think i find something

what the hell be that

that be the core
the gravity drive
the heart of the ship



justin check the containment for
radiation leak
peters



how be the client

crystallize



justin finish you sweep

almost do i just get to check one
thing

justin hold on a sec you be breaking
up



justin
static obscure she
voice

justin come in

what be it

i do not know
the life reading just
go off the scale

something wrong

what the hell

oh shit

miller do you read i peter

get they back

i be trying goddammit

what be happening



i do not know the screen be dead

meter
meter

he be in trouble
go

i be go

board party sound off
peters
do you read i

peters

denny

peters do you read i

do not leave i

justin
justin sound off
justin

hold on baby bear

oh i god

justin do you read i
justin


baby bear do not do this
do not do
this

here come another one
hold on

we lost the starboard baffle
the
hullos be breached

the safety circuit failed

we be losing atmosphere

there be pressure suit in the
airlock
go

can anybody hear i



skipper

peters



you okay

yeah
i be i be okay



we have a man down

coop where be you



the containment second containment

hold on coop



captain miller

smith where the hell have you be

we have a situation here

we lost the starboard baffle and the
hull cracked
we safety seal do not
close the circuit fry

do we have enough time for a weld



we do not have time to fart

we be losing pressure at liters
a second and we oxygen tank be
crack
in three minute we
atmosphere will be go
we be
fucking dead

no one die on i watch smith
what about the reserve tank



they be go

the event horizon

what

it still have air and reserve power
we can activate gravity and life
support

what if the air have go bad
we
can not wear these suit forever

i do not think this be a good idea
we do not even know what happen on
that ship

it beat dying mister smith

dr
weir right
get on board the
event horizon
i will meet you at the
airlock



but

you hear i smith
peter be you
with i

i be ahead of you
bring the thermal
unit on line

hold tight and prep for gees


everybody okay

we be all here

okay
let we find out how much time
we just buy

we have not tested the air yet
it
could be contaminate

no time
we need whatever left in
we suit to repair the clark
like
it or not this be the only oxygen
for three billion kilometer

it taste bad

but you can breathe it


the antennae array completely fry
we have get no radio no laser no
highgain
no one going to be
coming to help we

how much ohtwo do we have

oxygen be not the problem

carbon dioxide

it be building up with every breath
we take
and the filter on the
event horizon be shoot

we can take the filter from the
clark

i think of that with the filter
from the clark we have get enough
breathable air for twenty hour
after that we would well be on we
way home

what about the life reading you
picked up

the event horizon sensor show the
same thing
Bioreadings of
indeterminate origin
right before
that wave hit the clark there be
some kind of surge right off the
scale but now it be back to it
previous level

what be cause the reading

i do not know but whatever it be
it be not the crew

so where be the rest of the crew
we have be over every inch of this
ship and all we have find be blood
dr
weir
any suggestion

what happen here


captain miller you copy



i be here smith how be the clark

i have find a six inch fracture in
the outer hull
we should be able to
repair it and repressurize it be
going to take some time



we do not have time smith
in twenty
hour we run out of air

understand


how be he

he vital be stable but he be
unresponsive to stimulus
he might
wake up in fifteen minute
he might
not wake up at all

what happen to he

take sample from these stain
compare they to medical record i
want to know whose blood this be


okay people there be be a change
in the mission
in less than eighteen
hour we will run out of breathable
air
we primary objective be now
survival
that mean we focus on
repair the lewis and clark and
salvage whatever will buy we more
time
we secondary objective be finding
out what happen to this ship and
it crew
two month from now i
fully intend to be standing in front
of the good admiral giving i report
and i would like to have more than i
dick in i hand

peter i want you to go through the
ship log see if we can not find
some answer

i can use the station in medical
keep an eye on justin

fine
starck i want you to repeat
the bioscan

what be the point
i will just get the
same thing

not acceptable
i want to know what be
cause those reading
if the crew
be dead i want the body i want
the crew find

i can reconfigure the scan for
amylase protein

do it
dr
weir

yes

one of i man be down
i want to
know what happen to he

i told you
he be inside the core

it be like
nothing be there
and then justin appear and the
core
become metal

no he do not

you be not there
i see it

see what mr
cooper
what do you
really see because what you be
describe be not physically
possible

cooper
enough

dr
weir justin may die
whatever
happen to he could happen to all
of we

i do not know what happen to justin

i be telling you i see it

what you see could have be an
optical effect cause by gravitational
distortion

i know what i see and it be not a
fuck optical effect


hold on what be this gravitational
distortion


it be possible that a burst of gravity
wave escaped from the core
distort spacetime
they could be
what hit the lewis and clark

what could because they
what be in the core

it be complicate

how much time do you need
we have
seventeen hour and fortytwo minute
now
what be in the core

black hole


that be how the gravity drive works
you see
it focus the black hole
immense gravitational power to create
the gateway
that be how the event
horizon travel fast than light

i can not believe we build this

it be insane

insane
the fine astronaut fight
to be post to this ship
it would
take the lewis and clark a thousand
year to reach we close star
the
event horizon could be there in a
day

if it worked

if it worked yes

i want this room sealed
the second
containment be off limit

there be no danger
the black hole be
contained behind three magnetic
field it be under control

you black hole damn near ripped i
ship apart
it may have killed one
of i man
no one go near that thing


justin

mommy



peters

what be wrong

nothing
it be nothing


you be out there a long time
trying
to break i record

i would rather spend the next twelve
hour outside than another five
minute in this can
this ship be
bad
it watch you

what

you hear i
this ship it be crazy
trying to go fast light that be
like the tower of babel

shit smith you be going biblical
on i

you know what happen to the tower
of babel do not you
it fell down

you be sucking too much nitrogen in
you mix


why dr
weir i think you be in love

hmmm
claire used to tell i i loved
the event horizon more than i loved
she
i told she that be not true i
just know the event horizon well
that be all

claire be you wife

yes

it must be hard be so far away
from she

yes
i miss she
she die
two year
now

i be sorry

these thing happen
react to something
on the screen
wait a minute that be not right

you have something dr
weir

the date

what about it

the event horizon computer think
it be

it be

exactly
the ship internal clock
be off by seven year

maybe a power interruption crashed
the system

no there be no evidence of a surge
or spike of any kind
it be as if
time just
stopped for seven year

explanation

intense gravitational field effect
the passage of time it be possible
black hole make sense on paper
it be all math you see but as to
what really happen
the event horizon have passed beyond
we plane of reality and like
lazarus return from the dead



captain miller dr
weir
i find
the final log entry




we have reach safe distance and
be preparing to engage the gravity
drive and open the gateway

the speaker be the mission
commander

john Kilpack



when you get this message god
will we will reach the solar
system of proxima centauri

i wonder if they ever make it

i just want to say how proud i be of
i crew
i would like to name i station
head chris chambers janice rubin
dick smith tom fender and Stacie
collins
and to bill weir and all
the scientist that get we here

i
uh i have something historic to
say and i write it down but i
i
can not find it
ave atque vale
hail and farewell

what the hell be that
dr
weir

i do not know

i can run the image through a series
of filter try to clean it up

do it

what be happening

power drain

we barely have enough power for life
support as it be if we can not stop
the drain we be not going to make it

the core

wait

the rest of you stay here i do not
want anyone else going near that
thing


no radiation
what be cause the
drain

the magnetic field be holding
maybe a short in the failsafe
circuit
i will check it out

we do not get the power back we
air going to go bad

check the core for radiation
carbon
dioxide may be the least of we
worry

Ethree
Efive
Eseven
where
be you

what the hell

skipper the bioscan just go off
the scale

justin
can you hear i
justin



there you be

um
captain miller
i uh i seem to
have a problem with i light

captain miller

billy



billy
help i
i be so cold

we just lost all power in here
dr
weir

do not leave i

claire



help i
i be so cold

so cold


carbon dioxide poison produce
hallucination impair judgement

goddammit it be not a
hallucination
i see a man he be
on fire
and then he disappeared

maybe one of the original crew

no
it be someone else

who

dr
weir you be right there you
must have hear something see
something

no
i see nothing

i do

about an hour ago
in medical
i see
i son
he be lying on one of the
examination table and he leg
be

be not it possible that you be
traumatize by finding the body on
the bridge

i have see body before
this be
different

peters be right
it like something
reaching into you mind
see you
thought and making they real
smith
do you or cooper experience anything
unusual

i do not see anything and i do not
have to see anything
this ship be
fucked

thank you for that scientific
analysis mister smith

hey
you do not need to be a scientist
figure it out

smith

you break all the law of physics
you think there will not be a price
you already killed the first crew

that be enough



i be sorry i
i do not know why i
do that

carbon dioxide

he be fucking lying you know
something

that be it that be enough for one
day smith
i need you back on the
clark i need you calm i need you
use you head you make a mistake
out there none of be get home
you understand

sir

get outside go back to work
i will
join you shortly

we be a long way from home and we be
in a bad place
let we not make it
badly
if anyone have any constructive
suggestion now be the time

i think i can stabilize the field
around the singularity that should
prevent another power drain

do it

to conserve we oxygen we should
severely restrict we activity
anyone
who can should get some sleep

i do not need sleep
i need
answer

miller

what be it starck

i run the bioscan with the
filter
the result be bioreadings
of indeterminate origin


bioreadings of indeterminate
origin do not you have anything
useful to tell i

i have get a theory

go ahead

there be a another surge in the bio
reading right before you
you see
what you see
we picked up a similar
reading right before the clarke be
damaged
what if there be a
connection between the two
the
gravity wave the hallucination
all part of an defensive reaction
like an immune system

i do not need to hear this

you have get to listen

to what
what be you saying
this
ship be alive

i do not say that i said the bio
reading correspond to what happen
to you the ship be react to we

we be hanging on by we fingernail
and you be giving i bullshit
story

it be not bullshit it be the only
conclusion the data support

starck do you know how crazy that
sound
it be impossible

i know that

if you know it be impossible then
why you waste i time

i think you wanted an answer
and
that be the only one i have

what i want be to survive the next
ten hour

nine hour and twentytwo minute

i be going outside to work on the
clark
and starck
do not tell anyone
what you just told i
we have get
enough to worry about


justin

justin

what be wrong

you do not hear it
you must have
hear it

hear what

oh
nothing

sit down

stop it
stop it

what be it

what be you do

it want i
i have to go

no

in we current environment dr
weir
selfcontrol be an asset

i be alright
please

what be it

the forward airlock

miller smith cooper any of you in
the airlock



that be a negative starck

justin

justin no


we will have to reroute through the
port conduit to the

what about the accumulator



miller come in

what be going on in there starck



Justins in the airlock



what

he be awake he be in the airlock
he be not wearing a suit

stay here
do not stop working

but justin

i will get he


he be engaged the override

can you shut it down

i will try
you well get you
bag of trick

justin
open the door

open the door


i be on i way starck



you well hurry
he be engaged the
override we can not open the inner
door


the door justin
open the door

do you hear it

yes
yes justin we hear it

keep he talking

do you know what it be

word



what justin what show you



it will not stop it go on and on and
on



what do



the dark inside i



it be inside and it eat and eat
until there be nothing leave



the dark inside

i do not
understand



from the other place


the other crew they be there they be
waiting for i
they be waiting for
you
i will not go back there
i
will not

justin look at i
look at i
open
this door

i do not think she can talk he down
we need a sedative

if he open the outer door he will
turn insideout

almost get it



come on Babybear open this door

if you could see the thing i have
see you would not try to stop i
you would come with i



standby for decompression
thirty
second

hey MamaBear
what be do

oh i god

starck

i can not
the inner door can not open
once the outer door have be
trigger it would decompress the
entire ship

you get to open you get to stop it
please

we have to do something oh god

skipper justin just activate the
door
it be on a thirty second delay

patch i through to he



justin

skipper you get to help i

twenty second

tell they to open the door



they can not do that justin now listen
carefully

i do not want to die

you be not going to die
not today
i want you to do exactly as i say
and i be going to get you out of there
alright

but i can not
i get to get out of
here
skipper please

justin
i will not let you die

okay
okay

tuck yourself into a crouch
position shut you eye as tight as
you can

five second

exhale everything you get baby bear
we can not have any air in those lung
blow it all out

oh god

oh god
justin

i have get a pulse he be alive

pressure

over and falling


he be crashing

he can breathe
that be good
let we
get he to medical go go




intubate pure oxygen feed get the
nitrogen out of he blood



he peritoneum have rupture



one thing at a time let we keep he
breathe
start the drip cc
fibrinogen christ he be bleed
out


he will live
if we ever make it
back

we will make it

level will reach toxic level
in four hour

peters
we need to know what happen
to the crew
before it happen to
we

i will get back to the log
but on the
bridge i will not go back back in
there

thanks

justin said something about the
dark inside i
what do he mean

it mean nothing

be that you expert opinion
the
only answer we have have out of you be
i do not know


justin just tried to kill himself
the man be clearly insane

how would you explain you own
behavior

what

on the bridge
you said it wanted
you

i said that

yes
you do

i do not remember saying that
maybe i be insane too

i want to know what cause that noise
i want to know why one of i crew
tried to throw himself out of the
airlock

thermal change in the hull could
have cause the metal to expand and
contract very suddenly cause
reverberation

that be bullshit and you know it
you
build this fuck ship and all i have
hear from you be bullshit

what do you want i to say

you said this ship create a
gateway

yes

to what
where do this ship go
where do you send it

i do not know

where have it be for the past seven
year

i do not know

the other place what be that

i do not
i do not know
there be a lot of thing
going on here that i do not understand
truth take time

that be exactly what we do not have
doctor




do not leave i




any change

no
no change
i have analyzed Justins blood sample
there be no evidence of excessive
level of carbon dioxide
or anything
else out of ordinary

of course not
justin just climb
into the airlock because he feel
like it
just one of those thing
i swear i would never lose another man
i come close today
real close

another man
who

it be on the goliath
there be
this bosun Corrick a young guy a
lot like justin
edmund Corrick
from decatur georgia
he get catch
when the pressure door sealed one
closed on he arm
severed it at the
wrist
the pain of that must have
be
he passed out and

i i tried to go back for he to
save he but i could not get to he
in time
the fire
have you ever
see fire in zerogravity
it be like
a liquid it slide over everything
it be like a wave breaking over
he a wave of fire
and then he be
go
i never told anyone until now
but
this ship know
it know about
the goliath it know about Corrick
it know we secret
it know what
we be afraid of
and now you be going to tell i it be
carbon dioxide

no

what be it

i have be listening to the
transmission
and i think houston
make a mistake in the translation

go on

they think it said Liberatis
i save i but it be not i

it be tutemet
save yourself


it be not a distress call
it be a
warn

it get bad

it be very hard to make out but listen
to this final part

do you hear it
right there

hear what

it sound like ex infera
ex
from
infera the ablative case of
inferi
hell


save yourself
from hell

what be you saying be you saying
that this ship be possess

no
i do not believe in that sort of
thing
but if dr
weir be right this ship
have passed beyond the boundary of
we universe of reality
who know
where this ship have be
what
it be see
and what it be bring back with it



captain miller we be ready to
repressurize the clark

on i way


alright cooper

cross you finger



it be holding
she be holding



we be still venting trace gas
give i twenty minute to plug the
hole

you get it coop

back in business


you get any coffee

it be cold

i do not care

starck

sweet jesus
miller



Liberatis tutemet ex infera

we be leaving

you can not you order be specific


to rescue the crew and salvage
the ship
the crew be dead dr
weir
this ship killed they
and now
it be killing we

you be insane
you have lost you mind

maybe you be right
but it be still
i command and i have leeway to
abort when i feel there be an
unacceptable threat to i crew
and
i think there be
starck download all the file from
the event horizon computer
coop
smith finish moving the scrubber
back onto the clark

do not
do not do this

it be do


what be going on sweetheart

scrubber for the clark
miller
pulled the plug on the mission

about goddam time

what about i ship

we will take the lewis and clark to
a safe distance and then launch tac
missile at the event horizon until
i be satisfy that she have be
destroyed
fuck this ship

you
you can not do that

watch i

you can not kill she i will not let you
i lost she once i will not lose she
again



miller come in

starck what the hell be going on

we just lost main power again

goddammit
starck get those file
and vacate
i want off this ship

you can not leave
she will not let you

just get you gear back onto the
lewis and clark doctor or you will
find yourself looking for a ride
home



i be home

weir


all hand
dr
weir be missing
i
want he find and restrained

let we go let we go this place freak
i out

last one

denny

smith



mommy

denny


thank you



captain we get a problem

now what


she be right behind i i turn
around she be go
she could be
anywhere

alright
prep the clark for launch
i will find she


denny
denny come to mommy

hold on denny Mommys coming

denny

denny

mommy

you can walk
denny you can walk
oh i baby

want to show you mommy want to show
you something

denny


i will not
i will not leave
this be i
ship

oh no
peters

why do you do that
you do not have
to do that



billy

solid as a rock
hey smith



smith clear that airlock man i be
coming in

roger that

dr
weir
hey get you ass back on
board
dr
weir

skipper come in



skipper

what be it smith



i just see weir i think he be
mess around on the clark

smith get out of there



come again skipper

one of the explosive be miss
from the corridor
i think weir may
have put it on the clark



get off the clark now and wait for
i at the airlock

no no we just get she back
together



get out of there now

where be it where be it

smith
smith
fuck

i gotcha
i gotcha

i gotcha




the clarks go
smith and cooper
be dead

what happen



weir
he used one of the explosive
from the corridor

you read i




come in

peters



peter be you there

starck do you read i
starck



i told you
she will not let you
leave

son of a bitch



oh i god

please

oh god what do i
how do
i

please
kill

oh god


weir

hold on
get you outta these

you eye

i do not need they anymore
where
we be going we will not need eye to
see

what be you talking about

do you know what a singularity be
miller
do you mind truly fathom
what a black hole be
it be
absolute and eternal

and if god be everything
then i have see the devil
it be a liberate experience

gravity drive primed
do you wish to
engage

what be you do

gravity drive engaged
activation in
Tminus ten minute

if you miss i you will blow out the
hull
you will die too

what make you think i will miss



do not leave i

please
help help i

give i you hand
you hand

the forward airlock

weir can not be alive

whatever be on that bridge be not
weir

stay behind i

cooper

let i breathe let i breathe

you be okay now it be over

it be not over
it be just starting

weir activate the drive
he be sending
we to the other place

we have get to shut it down we have get
to

how
the bridge be go

there must be a way
what about
engineering

can you shut it down

i do not know the process dr
weir
be the expert

i do not want to go where the last
crew go
i would rather be dead



blow it up

we blow the corridor
use the
foredecks as a lifeboat separate it
from the rest of the ship
we stay
put

and the gravity drive go where
no man have go before


you prep the gravity couch
i be
going to manually arm those
explosive
