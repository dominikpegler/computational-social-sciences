passionately in love with he wife
one day he said to Gyges the son of
somebody anyway he favorite warrior

Daskylus

yes thank you Gyges son of Daskylus
Candaules said to he i do not think you
believe i when i tell you how beautiful
i wife be
and although Gyges reply he
do find the queen magnificent the king
insist he would find some way to prove
beyond dispute that she be fair of
all woman
do you all know this story

i will hide you in the room where
we sleep said Candaules

Candaules

Candaules
you be laughing at i

i be not laughing at you
go on please

when i wife come to lie down she always
lay she garment one by one on a seat
near the entrance of the room and from
where you stand you will be able to gaze
on she at you leisure

and that evening it be exactly as the
king have tell he she go to the chair
and remove she clothes one by one
until she stand naked in full view of
Gyges
and indeed she be more lovely
than he could have imagined

but then the queen look up and see
Gyges concealed in the shadow
and
though she said nothing she shudder
the next day she send for Gyges and
challenged he
and hearing he story
she said this

off with he head


death for gazing on that which you
should not or else kill i husband who
shame i and become king in he place

so Gyges killed the king and marry
the queen and become ruler of lydia
for twenty eight year

sound perfectly clear
where do
the ostrich come in

the ostrich be a detour
poor man hunt
an ostrich it be the method
nothing to do
with Zerzura
to catch an ostrich you must
appear not to move
the man find a place
where the ostrich feed a wadi and stand
where the ostrich can see he on the
horizon and do not move do not eat
otherwise the ostrich will run
at nightfall
he move fifty sixty yard
when the
ostrich come the next day the man be
there but he be near
haunt the ostrich

yes the ostrich it will feed a family
not just the meat but by selling the
feather beak the skin a year from
this one animal
so each day the
man get close
and the ostrich be
not sure have something changed

now the stand man be only a few
yard from where it feed
and then
one day the man be in the wadi in
the water
and the ostrich come as
always dip into the water and the
man and capture it

what be he saying
come on what do he say

he said be careful

be careful
you mean you or i
who

she or i

the one who appear not to be moving

gentleman to Zerzura

be concern

i have known katharine since she be
three i aunt be she aunt we be
practically brother and sister before
we be man and wife
i think i would
know what be and what be not too much
for she
i think she be know herself

very well

why be you people so threatened
by a woman

i have be think about how do
somebody like you decide to come to
the desert
what be it
you be do
whatever you be do in you castle
or wherever it be you live and one day
you say i have to go to the desert or what

i once travel with a terrific guide
who be taking i to Faya
he do not
speak for nine hour
at the end of
it he pointed at the horizon and
said Faya
that be a good day

i insist
there clearly be not room for
we all i be the least able to dig and
i be not one of the walk wounded

besides if i remain
it be the most effective method of
persuade i husband to abandon
whatever he be do and rescue we

into you book

we take several photograph
there be no need

you should come into the shelter

i be quite all right thank you

look over there

what be i looking at

see what be happening to they
the star

be a whirlwind in southern morocco the
Aajej against which the fellahin defend
themselves with knife
the ghibli from
tunis roll and roll and produce a
rather strange nervous condition


which mariner called the sea of
darkness
red sand from this wind
have fly as far as the south coast
of england producing shower so
dense they be mistaken for blood

fiction
we have a house on that coast
and it never rain blood

of a wind the Simoon so evil that a
nation declared war on it and march
