telegram myself

i see eve quite often after we
first meet but we never really
talk again until the party
margo give for bill when he
return from hollywood

it be always convenient at a party
to know the hostess well enough to
use she bedroom rather than go
where all the other have to go

now who be show up at this hour
it be time people go home hold
that coat up
eve hold it up
karen

there should be a new word for
happiness
be here with miss
channing have be i just can not
say she be be so wonderful do
so much for i

lloyd say margo compensate for
underplay on the stage by
overplay reality
she get up get she
coat
next to that sable i new mink
seem like an old bedjacket
throw it over she
shoulder
you have do you share eve
you have work wonder with margo

mrs
richards

karen

karen
she pick at the
coverlet
be not it awful i be about to
ask you for another favor after
all you have already do

Nobodys do so much eve you have
get to stop think of yourself as
one of the hundred needy
case
what be it

well
miss channings affair be
in such good shape
there be not
enough to keep i as busy as i
should be really not that i have
ever considered anything that would
take i away from she
but the
other day when i hear mr
fabian
tell miss channing that she
understudy be going to have a
baby and they would have to replace
she

you want to be Margos new
understudy

i do not let myself think about it
even
she look up rise as
she speak
but i do know the part so well
and every bit of the stage
there would be no need to break in a
new girl
suddenly afraid she
sit
but suppose i have to go on one
night
to an audience that come to
see margo channing
no i could not
possibly

do not worry too much about that
margo just do not miss
performance
if she can walk
crawl or roll she play

the show must go on

no dear
margo must go on
as a matter of fact i see no
reason why you should not be Margos
understudy

do you think miss channing would
approve

i think she would cheer

but mr
richards and mr
sampson

they will do as they be tell

then would you talk to mr
fabian
about it

of course

you will not forget it

i will not forget

i seem to be forever thank you
for something do not i

the bed look like a dead animal
act
which one be sable

but she just get here

she be on she way
with half the man
in the joint
it be only a fur coat

what do you expect live sable

diamond collar gold sleeve
you know picture people

bill say actor out there eat just
as infrequently as here

they can always grab orange off
tree
this you can not do in time
square

every now and then some elder
statesman of the theater or cinema
assure the public that actor and
actress be just plain folk
ignore the fact that they
great attraction to the public
be they complete lack of
resemblance to normal human being

as birdie and the sable
pass
now there be something a girl could
make sacrifice for

and probably have

sable

do you say sable or gable

either one

it be senseless to insist that
theatrical folk in new york
hollywood and london be no
different from the good people of
des moines Chillicothe and
liverpool
by and large we be
concentrate gathering of
neurotics egomaniacs emotional
misfit and precocious child

gable
why a feller like that do not
come east to do a play

he must be miserable the life he
life out there

these socalled abnormality
they be we stock in trade they
make we actor writer director
et cetera in the first place

answer i this
what make a man
become a producer

what make a man walk into a lion
cage with nothing but a chair

this answer satisfy i a hundred
percent

we all have abnormality in common
we be a breed apart from the rest
of the humanity we theater folk
we be the original displace
personality

laugh
to eve
you do not have to read he column
tomorrow you just hear it
i
do not agree addison

that happen to be you particular
abnormality

oh i admit there be a screwball
element in the theater
it stick
out it be get spotlight on it and
a brass band
but it be not basic
it be not standard if it be the
theater could not survive

oh waiter

that be not a waiter i dear
that be a butler

well i can not yell oh butler
can i
maybe somebody name be
butler

you have a point
an idiotic one
but a point

i do not want to make trouble
all i
want be a drink

leave i get you one

oh thank you mr
fabian

well do
i see you career rising
in the east like the sun
you be saying

i be saying that the theater be
ninetenths hard work
work do
the hard way by sweat
application and craftsmanship
i will
agree to this that to be a good
actor actress or anything else in
the theater mean wanting to be
that more than anything else in the
world

yes
yes it do

it mean concentration of ambition
desire and sacrifice such as no
other profession demand
and
i will agree that the man or woman
who accept those term can not be
ordinary can not be just someone
to give so much for almost always
so little

so little
so little do you say
why if there be nothing else
there be applause
it be like like
wave of love coming over the
footlight and wrapping you up
imagine
to know every night that
different hundreds of people love
you
they smile they eye shine
you have pleased they they want
you you belong
just that alone be
worth anything

do not get up
and please stop
acting as if i be the queen
mother

i be sorry i do not mean to

outside of a beehive margo you
behavior would hardly be considered
either queenly or motherly

you be in a beehive pal do not
you know
we be all busy little
bee full of sting making honey
day and night
be not we honey

margo really

please do not play governess karen
i have not you unyielding good
taste i wish i would go to radcliffe
too but father would not hear of it
he needed help at the notion
counter
i be be rude now be not i

should i say be not i

you be maudlin and full of self
pity
you be magnificent

how about calling it a night

and you pose as a playwright

situation pregnant with
possibility and all you can
think of be everybody to go to
sleep

it be a good thought

it will not play

as a nonprofessional i think it be
an excellent idea
undramatic but
practical

happy little housewife

cut it out

this be i house not a theater
in
i house you be a guest not a
director

then stop be a star start
treat you guest as you
support cast

hear hear

now let we not get into a big hassle

it be about time we do
it be about
time margo realized that what be
attractive on stage need not
necessarily be attractive off

all right
i be going to bed
you be the host
it be you party
happy birthday welcome home and
wewhoareabouttodiesaluteyou

too bad
we will miss the third act
they be going to play it off stage

coming

in a minute

you must not mind margo too much
even if i do

something i have do without
knowing

the reason be margo and do not try
to figure it out
einstein
could not

if i think i would offended she of
all people

eve
i be fond of margo too
but i

much as to kick she right square in
the pants

well if she be get to pick on
someone i would just as soon it be
i

i have often wonder max why you
bother with a chauffeur and
limousine in new york city

in i case it be necessary
too many
taxi driver write play

and too many of they be produced

let we go sit by the piano

history
like the chicago fire or
the massacre of the huguenot
even
before the party start i could
smell disaster in the air

finish dressing for that blasted
party

cameraman even DeMille could not
see anything looking through the
wrong end
so that be the first and last time

do not let i kill the point
or
be not it a story for grownup

you have hear it
about when i
look through the wrong end of a
camera finder

remind i to tell you about when i
look into the heart of an
artichoke

i would like to hear it

some snowy night in front of the
fire
in the meantime while
we be on the subject will you
check about the hor oeuvre
the
caterer forget they the varnish
be not dry or something

of course

look like i be going to have a very
fancy party

quality

so she seem

the steel begin to
flash
so you have pointed out so often
so
many quality so often
she
loyalty efficiency devotion
warmth affection and so young
so young and so fair

i can not believe you be making this

of an old clyde fitch play

clyde fitch think you may not
think so be well before i time

i have always denied the legend that
you be in we american cousin
the night lincoln be shoot

i do not think that be funny

of course it be funny this be all
too laughable to be anything else
you know what i think about this
this age obsession of yours and
now this ridiculous attempt to whip
yourself up into a jealous froth
because i spent ten minute with a
stagestruck kid

twenty minute

thirty minute forty minute
what
of it

stagestruck kid
she be a young
lady of quality

you know i be feed up with both the
young lady and she quality
study i as if as if i be a
play or a set of blueprint
how i
walk talk think eat sleep

kid trying in every way to be as
much like she ideal as possible

stop calling she a kid

happen there be particular
aspect of i life to which i would

right and privilege

keep you tooth sharp
all right
but you will not sharpen they on i
or on eve

what about she tooth
what about
she fang

an idealistic dreamyeyed kid by
the barroom benzedrine standard
of this megalomaniac society i
will not have it
eve harrington have
never by word look think or
suggestion indicated anything to i
but she adoration for you and she
happiness at we be in love
and
to intimate anything else do not
spell jealousy to i it spell a
paranoic insecurity that you should
be ashamed of

cut
print it

next reel
do i get drag off
screaming to the snake pit

just one person

you know what this be all about
do not you
it have very little to do
with whether you should play cora
it have everything to do with the
fact that you have have another fight
with bill

shine you have pleased they they
want you you belong
Anythings
worth that

do not get up

acting as if i be the queen
mother

what be it the wise man said
this too will pass away
two
week later the day of the
audition all be well with bill
and i the world and i

why so remote addison
i should
think you would be at the side of you
protegee lending she moral
support

miss caswell at the moment be
where i can lend no support moral
or otherwise

the lady shall we say
lounge

be violently i will to she tummy

it be good luck before an audition
she will be all right once it start

miss caswell get lucky too late
the audition be over

over
it can not be
i have come to
read with she
i promised max

the audition be called for

it be now nearly four

be it really
i must start wearing
a watch i never do you know
who read with miss caswell
bill
lloyd
well it could not have be max
who

naturally enough you understudy

i consider it highly unnatural to
allow a girl in an advance state
of pregnancy

i refer to you new and unpregnant
understudy
eve harrington

eve
i understudy

do not you know

of course i know

it just slipped you mind

how
how be miss caswell

frankly i do not remember

just slipped you mind

completely
nor i be sure could
anyone else present tell you how
miss caswell read or whether miss
caswell read or ride a pogo stick

be she that bad

margo as you know i have live in
the theater as a trappist monk
live in he faith
i have no other
world no other life and once in
a great while i experience that
moment of revelation for which all
true believer wait and pray
you
be one
jeanne Eagels another
paula Wessely
hayes there be
other three or four
eve
harrington will be among they

i take it she read well

it be not reading it be a
performance
brilliant vivid
something make of music and fire

how nice

in time she will be what you be

mass of music and fire
that be
i
an old kazoo and some sparkle
tell i be bill swept away too
or be you too full of revelation
to notice

bill do not say but lloyd be
beside himself
he listen to his
play as if someone else have written
it he said it sound so fresh
so new so full of meaning

how nice for lloyd
and how nice
for eve
how nice for everybody

eve be incredibly modest
she
insist that no credit be due
she that lloyd feel as he do only
because she read line exactly as
he have written they

the implication be that i have
not be reading they as written

to the good of i recollection
neither you name nor you
performance entered the
conversation

feeling well i dear

like i just swim the english
channel
now what

you next move it seem to i
should be toward television

tell i this
do they have
audition for television

that be all television be i dear
nothing but audition

terribly sorry i be late lunch be
long and i could not find a cab
where be miss caswell shall we
start
oh hello eve

hello miss channing

how be you making out in mr
fabians office
over the footlight to
max
i do not want you working the child
too hard max just because you
promise
as you see i keep i
promise too

it be all over

what be all over

the audition

eve
how enchanting
wherever do you get the idea of
have eve read with miss caswell

she be you understudy

eve
eve i understudy
but i have
no idea

i think you know
she be put
on over a week ago

it seem almost inconceivable that
i have not see she backstage but
with so many people loitering
around
well well
so eve be not
working for max after all
max you sly puss

miss channing i can not tell you how
glad i be that you arrive so late

really eve
why

well if you would be here to begin
with i would not have dare to read
at all

why not

and if you would come in the
middle i would have stopped i
could not have go on

what a pity all that fire and
music be turn off

what fire and music

you would not understand
how be miss caswell

back to copacabana
but eve
margo
let i tell you about eve

i be dreadful miss channing
believe i i have no right to be
anyone understudy much less
yours

i be sure you underestimate
yourself eve
you always do
you be about to tell i about
eve

you would have be proud of she

i be sure

she be a revelation

to you too

what do you mean

i mean among other thing that it
must have be a revelation to have
you twentyfouryearold character
play by twentyfouryearold
actress

that be beside the point

it be right to the point
also that
it must have sound so new and
fresh to you so exciting to have
the line read as you write they

addison

so full of meaning fire and music

you have be talking to that
venomous fishwife addison dewitt

in this case apparently as
trustworthy as the world almanac

you know when you come in that the
audition be over that eve be
you understudy
play that
childish game of cat and mouse

not mouse never mouse
if anything
rat

you have a genius for making
barroom brawl out of a perfectly
innocent misunderstand at most

perfectly innocent
man have be
hang for less
i be lie to
attack behind i back accuse of
reading you silly dialogue
inaccurately as if it be holy
gospel

i never said it be

then you listen as if someone
else have written you play whom
do you have in mind
sherwood
arthur miller
beaumont and
fletcher

may i say a word

no
what make you think that either
miller or sherwood would stand for
the nonsense i take from you
you would well stick to beaumont and
fletcher
they have be dead for
three hundred year

and they be get good
performance today than they ever
get
all playwright should be dead
for three hundred year

that would solve none of they
problem because actress never
die
the star never die and never
change

you can change this star any time
you want
for a new fresh
exciting one fully equip with
fire and music
any time you want
starting with tonight
performance

this be for lawyer to talk about
this concern a runoftheplay
contract and this you can not
rewrite or ad lib

be you threatening i with legal
action mr
fabian

be you breaking the contract

answer i question

who be i to threaten
i be a die
man

i do not hear you

i said i be a die man

not until the last drugstore have
sell it last pill

from the top of the
aisle
i shall never understand the weird
process by which a body with a
voice suddenly fancy itself a
mind
just when exactly do an
actress decide they be she word
she be saying and she thought she be
express

usually at the point when she be get
to rewrite and rethink they to keep
the audience from leaving the
theater

it be about time the piano realized
it have not written the concerto

and you i take it be the
paderewski who play he concerto
on i the piano
bill wave he cigarette
he be noncommittal
where be princess FireandMusic

who

the kid
junior

go

i must have frighten she away

i would not be surprise
sometimes
you frighten i

poor little flower
just drop
she petal and folded she tent

do not mix you metaphor

i mix what i like

okay
mix

i be nothing but a body with a
voice
no mind

what a body what a voice

the exship news reporter
no
body no voice all mind

the gong ring
the fight over
calm down

i will not calm down

do not calm down

you be be terribly tolerant
be not you

i be trying terribly hard

well you need not
i will not be
tolerate
and i will not be
plot against

here we go

such nonsense what do you all take
i for little nell from the
country
be i understudy for
over a week without i knowing
carefully hidden no doubt

now do not get carry away

show up for an audition when
everyone know i would be here
and
give a performance
out of nowhere
give a performance

you have be all through that with
lloyd

the playwright do not make the
performance and it do not just
happen
and this one do not full
of fire and music and whatnot it
be carefully rehearse i have no
doubt over and over full of those
bill sampson touch

i be sick and tire of these
paranoiac outburst

paranoiac

i do not know eve harrington be
you understudy until half past two
this afternoon

tell that to dr
freud
along with
the rest of it

no i will tell it to you
for the
last time i will tell it to you
because you have get to stop hurting
yourself and i and the two of we
by these paranoiac tantrum

that word again
i do not even know
what it mean

it be time you find out
i love
you
margo say ha

i love you
you be a beautiful and
intelligent woman
margo say body with a
voice
a beautiful and intelligent woman
and a great actress
he wait
margo say
nothing
at the peak of she career
you
have every reason for happiness
margo say except
happiness
every reason but due to some
strange uncontrollable
unconscious drive you permit the
slight action of a kid
margo sneer kid

kid like eve to turn you into a
hysterical scream harpy
now
once and for all stop it

it be obvious you be not a woman

i have be aware of that for some
time

well i be

i will say

do not be condescending

come on get up
i will buy you a
drink

i admit i may have see well
day but i be still not to be have
for the price of a cocktail like
a salt peanut

margo let we make peace

the term be too high
unconditional surrender

just be happy
just stopping all
this nonsense about eve and eve
and i

it be not nonsense

but if i tell you it be as i just
do
be you listening to i
be not that enough

i wish it be

then what would be enough
if we be marry

i would not want you to marry i
just to prove something

you have have so many reason for not
wanting to marry i
margo tell
i what be behind all this

i i do not know bill
just a
feeling i do not know

i think you do know but you will not
or can not tell i
i said before it be going to be i
last try and i mean it
i can not
think of anything else to do
i
wish i could
we usually wind up screaming and
throwing thing as the curtain
come down
then it come up again
and everything fine
but not this
time
you know there be not a playwright
in the world who could make i
believe this would happen between
two adult people
goodbye margo

bill
where be you going
to find
eve

that suddenly make the whole thing
believable

on the day of the audition i
big worry be to keep a banana
looking part of an eggplant
then
lloyd come home
in the b
g
lloyd let we
himself in
it be right after he brawl with
margo

lloyd what happen

up to here
that be where i have get
it up to here
of all the star
ride presumptuous hysterical

margo again

and again and again
two hour late
for the audition to begin with

that be on time for margo

then a childish heavyhanded
routine about not knowing eve be
she understudy

it be just possible she do not

of course she know
for one thing
addison told she how superbly eve
have read the part
karen let i tell you about eve
she be get everything a bear
actress
sensitive understand
young exciting vibrant

do not run out of adjective
dear

everything a playwright first
think of wanting to write about
until he play become a vehicle
for miss channing

margo have not do badly by it

margo
Margos great
she know it
that be the trouble
she can play peck bad boy all she
want and who be to stop she
who be
to give she that boot in the rear
she need and deserve

it be going to be a cozy weekend

what be

we be driving out to the country
tomorrow night
just the four of
we
bill margo you and i

well
we have spent weekend before
with nobody talking
just be sure to lock up all
blunt instrument and throwable
object

newton they say think of
gravity by get hit on the head
by an apple
and the man who
invent the steam engine he be
watch a teakettle
but not
i
i big idea come to i just
sitting on a couch

that boot in the rear to margo
heaven know she have one coming
from i from lloyd from eve
bill max and so on we would all
feel those size fives of hers often
enough
but how
the answer be
buzzing around i like a fly

i have it
but i let it go
screaming and calling name be one
thing but this could mean

why not
why i said to myself
not
it would all seem perfectly
legitimate
and there be only two
people in the world who would know
also the boot would land where it
would do the most good for all
concern

and after all it be not more than
a perfectly harmless joke which
margo herself would be the first
to enjoy

and no reason why she should not
be tell about it in time

hello
will you call miss eve
harrington to the phone please
not at all
thank you


it be a cold weekend outside and
in
bill do not come at all
margo do not know where he be and
do not care she keep saying
somehow we staggered through sunday
and by the time we drive margo to
the station late monday afternoon
she and lloyd have thaw out to the
extent of be civil to each
other

what time be it

when you ask a minute ago it be
fivefortytwo
it be now five
fortythree
when you ask a minute
from no it will be

i just do not want margo to miss she
train
as it be she will barely make
the theater

Fivefiftyfive
we will be at the
station in plenty of time

that little place just two hour
form new york
it be on i list of
thingsI willneverunderstand
like
collecting shrunken indian head

of all people you should know what
it mean to want some peace and
quiet

peace and quit be for library

lloyd be careful

just a little skid that be all
this road like glass

karen and i just do not want an
accident

i have no intention of have an
accident

it be not important whether you do
we be wearing long underwear

now what be this

but it can not be
we can not be out of
gas
i filled it myself yesterday
be not it full when you drive to
brewster this morning

i guess i do not look
you know i
do not pay attention to those
thing

incredible

how much time have we

roughly ten minute

how far to the station

three or four mile

any house or farm around where we
can borrow gas

none in sight there be not many
along this back road

not many car either not much
chance of a lift

well
no sense i just sitting
here
i be going to walk up about
half a mile just in case

you will break you neck on that ice

what a way to die trying to get
an actress to the theater in time
tell max i want to be buried with
royalty

do not joke about such thing

how fortunate that i have an
understudy so ready so will and
so able to go on

the audience will want it money
refund believe i

thank you lloyd
godspeed

he always look so pathetic
whenever he do anything physical

it seem to i that walking for
most people be not very dangerous

i just never think of lloyd as
anywhere but indoors and anything
but sitting down

be brave
he will come back with or
without gas

do you want it on

it do not matter

i detest cheap sentiment

karen
karen say hm

i have not be pleasant this
weekend

we have all seem a little tense
lately

come to think of it i have not be
very pleasant for week
for that
i be truly sorry
more than any two
people i know i do not want you and
lloyd to be angry with i

we be never deeply angry we just
get sore
the way you do
we know
you too well

so many people know i
i wish i
do
i wish someone would tell be
about i

you be margo
just margo

and what be that
besides something
spell out in light bulb i mean
besides something called
temperament which consist mostly
of swoop about on a broomstick
cream at the top of i voice
infant behave the way i do you
know
they carry on and misbehave
they would get drink if they know how
when they can not have what they
want
when they feel unwanted and
insecure or unloved

what about bill

what about bill

he be in love with you

more than anything in this world i
love bill
and i want bill
i want
he to want i
but i
not margo
channing
and if i can not tell they
apart how can he

why should he and why should you

bill in love with margo channing
he be fight with she worked with
she loved she
but ten year
from now margo channing will have
cease to exist
and what be left
will be
what

margo
bill be all of eight year
young than you

those year stretch as the year go
on
i have see it happen too often

not to you
not to bill

be not that what they always say

i do not suppose the heater run
when the motor do not

silly be not it
you would think they would
fix it so people could just sit in
a car and keep warm

about eve
i have act pretty
disgracefully toward she too

well

let we not fumble for excuse not
here and now with i hair down
at
best let we say i have be
oversensitive to
well to the
fact that she be so young so
feminine and helpless
to so many
thing i want to be for bill
funny business a woman career
the thing you drop on you way up
the ladder so you can move fast
you forget you will need they again
when you go back to be a woman
that be one career all female have
in common whether we like it or
not be a woman
sooner or later we have all get to
work at it no matter what other
career we have have or wanted
and
in the last analysis nothing be
any good unless you can look up
just before dinner or turn around
in bed and there he be
without
that you be not woman
you be
something with a french provincial
office or a book full of clipping
but you be not a woman
slow curtain
the end

margo
margo i want you to know how sorry
i be about this

about what

indicate they
predicament
this
i can not tell you how sorry i
am

do not give it another think one
of destiny many prank
after
all you do not personally drain
the gasoline out of the tank

eve of course be superb
many of
the audience understandably
preferred to return another time to
see margo
but those who remain cheer
loudly lustily and long for eve
how thoughtful of she to call and
invite i that afternoon

and what a happy coincidence
that several representative of
other newspaper happen to be
present
all of we invited that
afternoon to attend an understudy
performance

about which the management know
nothing until they be forced to
ring up the curtain at nine
of the clock
coincidence
also every
indication of intrigue skulduggery
and fraud

you be good than all right
kid you give a performance you
ring a bell

little thing here and there it
do not matter
you can be proud of
yourself you have get a right to be

be you proud of i bill

i will admit i be worry when max
called
i have i doubt

you should not have have any doubt

after all the other day be one
scene the wood be full of one
scene sensation
but you do it
with work and patience you will be a
fine actress
if that be what you
want to be

be that what you want i to be

i be talking about you
and what you
want

so be i

what have i get to do with it

everything

the name i have be called
but
never svengali
good luck

do not run away bill

from what would i be running

you be always after truth on the
stage
what about off

i be for it

then face it
i have
since that
first night here in the
dressing room

when i told you what every young
actress should know

when you told i that whatever i
become it would be because of you

you makeups a little heavy

and for you

you be quite a girl

you think

i be in love with margo
have not you
hear

you hear all kind of thing

i be only human rumor to the
contrary
and i be as curious as the
next man

find out

only thing what i go after i want
to go after
i do not want it to
come after i

do not cry
just score it as an
incomplete forward pass

may i come in

certainly mr
dewitt

i expect to find this little room
overcrowded with a theater full of
people at you foot

i consider myself lucky they do not
throw thing

of course you performance be no
surprise to i
after the other day
i regard it as no more than a
promise fulfilled

you be more than kind
but it be
still miss channings performance
i be just a carbon copy you read
when you can not find the original

you be more than modest

it be not modesty
i just do not try
to kid myself

revolutionary approach to the
theater
however if i may a
suggestion

please do

i think the time have come for you
to she would some of you humility
it
be just as false not to blow you
horn at all as it be to blow it too
loudly

i do not think i have do anything to
sound off about

we all come into this world with
we little ego equip with
individual horn
if we do not blow
they who will

even so
one isolated pretty good
performance by an understudy
it will
be forgotten tomorrow

it need not be

even if i wanted to as you say
be less humble blow i own horn
how would i do it
i be less than
nobody

i be somebody

you certainly be

leave the door open a bit so we
can talk

after you change if you be not
busy elsewhere we can have supper

i would love to
or should i pretend
i be busy

let we have a minimum of pretend
i will want to do a column about you

i be not enough for a paragraph

perhaps more than one
there be so
much i want to know
i have hear
you story in bit and piece
you home in wisconsin you tragic
marriage you financial attachment
to margo it start in san
francisco do not it

addison
smile
i say you idolatry of margo
start in san francisco do not
it

that be right

san francisco
an oasis of
civilization in the california
desert
tell i do you share i
high opinion of san francisco

yes
i do

and that memorable night when margo
first dazzle you from the stage
which theater be it in san
francisco
be it the Shubert

yes
the Shubert

fine old theater the Shubert
full of tradition untouched by the
earthquake so sorry fire
by
the way what be you husband
name

eddie

eddie what

i be about to go into the shower i
will not be able to hear you

i can wait
where would you like to
go
we will make this a special
night

you take charge

i believe i will

some of the morning paper carry
a little squib about eves
performance
not much but full
praise
i could not imagine how they find
out about it but lloyd said Maxs
publicity man probably send out the
story

at any rate i feel terribly
guilty and ashamed of myself and
wanted nothing so much as to forget
the whole thing
margo and i be
have lunch at just like
girlfriend with hat on

have miss channing come in

not yet mrs
richards

eve
i have hear the most wonderful
thing about you performance

mostly relief that i manage to
stagger through it at all

she be magnificent

then you have hear too

i be there
an eyewitness

you be there
at the play last
night

happy coincidence

we be have lunch with a movie
talent scout

they certainly do not waste much
time

nothing definite yet it be just to
have lunch

they will be wasting this much of
they time at any rate
eve have no
intention of going to hollywood

from the smartness of you dress i
take it you luncheon companion be
a lady

margo

margo
lunch in public

it be new margo
but she be just as
late as the old one

she may be late than you think

why not read i column to pass the
time
the minute will fly like
hour
and now we must join we
sunburn eager beaver


i hat which have lo these
many season become more firmly
rooted about i ear be lift to
miss harrington
i be once more
available for dancing in the
street and shouting from the
housetop

i think that one
go out with Woollcott
she skip part of the
column
down here
here listen to this

miss harrington have much to
tell and these column shall
report she faithfully about the
lamentable practice in we theater
of permit shall we say
mature actress to continue
playing role require a youth and
vigor of which they retain but a
dim memory

i just can not believe it

it get good
about the
understandable reluctance on the
part of we entrench first lady
of the stage to encourage shall we
say young actress
about
miss harringtons own long and
unsupported struggle for
opportunity

i can not believe eve said those
thing

in this rat race everybody
guilty till they be prove
innocent
one of the difference
between the theater and
civilization
what get i be how all of
those paper in town happen to
catch that particular performance

lloyd say it be a publicity
release

the little witch must have have
indian runner out snatching
critic out of bar steam room
and museum or wherever they hole
up
well she will not get away with
it
nor will addison dewitt and he
poison pen
if equity or i lawyer
can not or will not do anything about
it i will personally stuff that
pathetic little lose lamb down mr
deWitts ugly throat

i come as soon as i read that piece
of filth
i run all the way

bill here baby
Everythings all
right now

i guess at this point i be what the
french call de trope

maybe just a little around the
edge

it be addison from start to
finish it drip with he brand of
venom
taking advantage of a kid
like that twist she word
making she say what he wanted she
to say

where do you get all that
information

eve

eve

she be be to see i as a matter
of fact she left just before you
come in you just missed she

that be a pity

she wanted to explain about she
interview wanted to apologize to
someone and do not dare face
margo

i wonder why

she start to tell i all about it
and she could not finish she
cry so

you know i have be going over we
financial condition if you will
pardon the expression

that be quite a change of subject

what with tax coming up and
since i be a playwright and not an
oil well operator well i have be
think

i be trying hard to follow you

if instead of waiting until next
season to do footstep on the
ceiling which be in pretty good
shape and if margo can be talk
into going on tour with age in
wood we could put footstep

into production right away

i be beginning to catch up

if we could cast it properly that
be

maybe get some young actress for
the part
someone who look the
part as well as play it

you have get to admit it would be a
novelty

now you be quoting addison
or eve

eve do mention the play you know
but just in passing she be never
ask to play a part like cora
she would never have the nerve

eve would ask abbott to give she
costello

no i get the idea myself while
she be talking to i

with gesture of course

for once to write something and
have it realized completely
for
once not to compromise

lloyd richards you be not to
consider giving that contemptible
little worm the part of cora


now just a minute

margo channing have not be exactly
a compromise all these year half
the playwright in the world would
give they shirt for that
particular compromise

now just a minute

it strike i that eves disloyalty
and ingratitude must be contagious

all this fuss and hysteria because
an impulsive kid get carry away
by excitement and the conniving of
a professional manure slinger named
dewitt
she apologize do not she

on she knee i have no doubt
very
touching very AcademyofDramatic
arts

that bitter cynicism of yours be
something you have acquired since you
left radcliffe

the cynicism you refer to i
acquired the day i discovered i be
different from little boy

hello
hi margo
no not at all
karen and i be just chatting
hmm
why why yes i be sure we
can and i be sure we would love to
right

ish
see you then

margo and bill want we to meet
they at the cub room tonight after
theater
for a bottle of wine

margo in the cub room
i could not
be more surprise if she would said
grant tomb

i be glad bill back

they would die without each other

darling i do not promise eve
anything
just said i think she would
be fine for the part but there
be some practical difficulty

such as

you for one
i told she you be
set on margo playing the part and
i certainly would not make a change
without you approval

that be fine
fine and dandy
i would
enjoy nothing more
just refer all
of miss harringtons future
request to i

the socalled art of acting be not
one for which i have a particularly
high regard

do not get up
and do not act as if i be the
queen mother

i do not expect you to be pleasant

i do not intend to be

can not we sit down
just for a
minute

i have get a lot to say
and none of
it be easy

there can not be very much

oh but there be

and easy or not i will not believe
a word

why should not you
please sit down

you know i have always considered
myself a very clever girl
smart
good head on i shoulder that
sort of thing never the wrong word
at the wrong time
but then i would
never meet addison dewitt
i remember once i have a tooth
pull
they give i some
anaesthetic i do not remember the
name and it affected i in a
strange way
i hear myself saying
thing i be not even think
as
if i mind be someplace outside
of i body and could not control
what i do or said

and you feel just like that
talking to addison

in a way
you find yourself trying
to say what you mean but somehow
the word change and they become
he word and suddenly you be not
saying what you mean but what he
means

do you expect i to believe that
you do not say any of those thing
that they be all addison

no
i do not expect you to believe
anything
except that the
responsibility be mine
and the
disgrace

let we not get overdramatic

you have really get a low opinion of
i have not you
we will i will give
you some pleasant news
i have be
told off in no uncertain term all
over town
miss channing should be
happy to hear that
to know how
loyal she friend be how much
more loyal they be than she have a
right to expect i to be

eve
do not cry

i be not crying

tell i
how do you lunch turn
out with the man from hollywood

some vague promise of a test
that be all if a particular part
should come along one of those
thing

but the rave about you
performance

an understudy performance

well
i think you be paint the
picture a little dark than it be
really
if nothing else and do not
underestimate he you have a
powerful friend in addison

he be not i friend
you be i
friend

he can help you

i wish i would never meet he i would like
he to be dead
i want i friend
back

eve
i i do not think you mean to
because unhappiness
but you do
more to yourself perhaps as it
turned out than to anyone else

i will never get over it

yes you will
you theater people
always do
nothing be forever in
the theater
love or hate success
or failure whatever it be it be
here it flare up and burn hot
and then it be go

i wish i could believe that

give yourself time
do not worry too
much about what people think
you be very young and very
talented
she get up she hand
still on eves shoulder
and believe it or not if
there be anything i can do

there be something

i think i know

something most important you can
do

you want to play cora
you want
i to tell lloyd i think you should
play it

if you told he so he would give i
the part
he said he would

after all you have say
do not you
know the part be written for
margo

it could have be fifteen year
ago
it be i part now

you talk just as addison said you
do

cora be i part
you have get to
tell lloyd it be for i

i do not think anything in the world
could make i say that

addison want i to play it

over i dead body

that will not be necessary
addison
know how margo happen to miss that
performance how i happen to
know she would miss it in time to call
he and notify every paper in
town
it be quite a story
addison could make quite a thing of
it imagine how snide and vicious
he could get and still write
nothing but the truth
i have a time
persuade he
you would well sit down
you look
a bit wobbly
if i play cora addison will
never tell what happen in or
out of print
simple exchange of
favor
and i be so happy i can do
something for you at long last
karen cover she face
with she hand
you friendship with margo you
deep close friendship what would
happen to it do you think if she
know the chap trick you would play on
she for i benefit
and you and
lloyd how long even in the
theater before people forget what
happen and trusted you again
no
it would be so much easier on
everyone concern if i be to
play cora
and so much good
theater too

part in a play
you would do all that
just for a part in a play

i would do much more for a part that
good

hungry

just some coffee

i be not surprise
after all that
humble pie

nothing of the kind
karen and i
have a nice talk

heart to heart
woman to woman
including a casual reference to the
part of cora and you hope of
playing it

i discuss it very openly
i told
she that i have spoken to lloyd
and that he be interest

she mention of course that
margo expect to play the part

oddly enough she do not say a
word about margo
just that she will
be happy to do what she can to see
that i play the part

just like that eh

just like that

do you know eve sometimes i
think you keep thing from i

i do not think that be funny

it be not mean to be

i confide in you and rely on you
more than anyone i have ever known
to say a thing like that now
without any reason when i need
you more than ever

i hope you mean what you say eve
i intend to hold you to it

nothing

everything
everything so
funny

lloyd never get around somehow
to asking i whether it be all
right with i for eve to play
cora
bill oddly enough
refuse to direct the play at first
with eve in it
lloyd and max
finally win he over
margo never
come to a rehearsal too much to do
around the house she said
i would
never known bill and lloyd to fight
as bitterly and as often
and
always over some business for eve
or a move or the way she read a
speech
but then i would never known
lloyd to meddle as much with bill
directing as far as it affected
eve that be
somehow eve keep
they going
bill stick it out and
lloyd seem happy and i think
it might be good if i skip
rehearsal from then on

it seem to i i have known always
that it would happen and here it
be
it feel helpless that helplessness
you feel when you have no talent to
offer outside of loving you
husband
how could i compete
everything lloyd loved about i he
have get used to long ago

hello
who
who be calling mr
richards

i name would not mean anything
i
room across the hall from eve
harrington and she be not well
she be be crying all night and
hysterical and she do not want a
doctor

who be it
what be it all about

do miss harrington tell you to
call mr
richards

no eve do not say to call he but
i remembered i see mr
richards
with she a couple of time and i
think they be such good
friend

hello
hello this be lloyd
richards
where be eve
let i talk
to she

she be up in she room mr
richards
i really hate to bother you like
this but the way eves be
feeling i be just worried sick
what with she leaving for new haven
tomorrow and everything

tell she not to worry tell she
i will be right over

i will tell she mr
richards

be not you
broadening the duty
of a playwright just a bit
rush
off in the middle of the night
like a country doctor

what would you do if instead of
eve the lead man have called up
to say she be hysterical

lloyd i do not want you to go

i do not think you would
it seem
to i karen that for some tine
now you have be developing a deep
unconcern for the feel of human
be in general

i be a human being i have get some

and for i feeling in
particular
for i play i career
and now for a frighten
hysterical girl on the eve of she
first night in the theater

have you forgotten about eve
what
she be what she be do

old wife tale born of envy and
jealousy
and a phobia against
truth

then tell i this be not true
that
you concern for you play and
career be one thing and that poor
frighten hysterical girl another
and that you concern for she have
nothing to do with either you play
or you career

that first last and foremost
you reason for going now be that
you want to be with eve

that addison but i do not know

not leave karen for you

what do you mean by that

to pull the ivy from the wall of
yale

you will not marry lloyd or
anyone else because i will not

dull cliche

belong to you
that sound
medieval something out of an old
melodrama

so do the history of the world
for the past twenty year

this frankly i have hope that you
would somehow have known have
taken it for grant that you and
i

taken it for grant
that you

to laugh at i

have you throw out

humanity an inability to love or
be loved insatiable ambition and
talent
