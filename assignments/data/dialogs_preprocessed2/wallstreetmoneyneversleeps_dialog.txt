i swear
to god

we be going to bounce back from this
and we be going to find out who spread
the rumor
and then we be going to
destroy they

i do not know anything about the
solvency of keller Zabel
i do know
that what be bringing down the stock at
this precise moment be rumor
and
this practice of short sell
american financial institution then
float rumor in order to profit
from they must be stopped
the uptick
rule must be reinstate

and once again i will point to
largely unregulated world of hedge
fund
an evergrowing and
increase powerful area of the market
that i repeatedly tried to regulate as
chairman of the

and the collapse of this legendary new
york financial institution be why i
continue to fight that battle as
governor of this great state

what


jacob
answer the door

you be not answering you phone

it broke

dude

what

i just find this out and it have not
hit the press yet

what
robby what be you trying to
say

andrew Zabel threw himself in front of
the subway this morning


we speaker today have quite a
checkered background in the world of
finance

he graduated from city college in
and become a security broker at
hudson river bank then moved on to
smith barney
in he go out on
he own to establish a spectacular
career as a independent trader then an
active participant in the craze of
the s
in he be indicted for insider
trade and then charged with other
various form of security fraud and
violation
in one of the most
harsh sentence ever given to a
white collar criminal
he serve
fourteen year in a maximum security
prison and he want i to stress that
it be not a country club

since he release in he have
written and have spoken publicly about
what he refer to as the current state
of the world economy
he be not
allow to trade on the exchange
he new book moral hazard
why wall
street have finally go too far

come out in october
please welcome
gordon gekko



you be all pretty much fucked

what be not funny be what be happening
out there
i do not think people get
it
and i know the financial center
of the world do not get it
which
happen to be washington now

to understand where we be we need to
understand how we get here
no good
deed go unpunished all fire start
with a well meaning spark and we
wanted american to be able to afford
home
sound nice enough
let we try
to get the middle and low class
into home they can own
so we make
money cheap and lower restriction
on mortgage lend

somebody remind i the other night
that i once said greed be good
i
swear i do not remember it but it
sound like something i would say in
the eighties
and i be right then
greed be good
america needed greed and risktaking
and leverage to get to become the
superpower we be
or be
and
capitalism needed greed and risk and
leverage to become the economic
platform it have become
but those
same attribute that get we there be
now the liability that threaten to
destroy we

so greed have be redefined
who
know maybe it be always like this
and like everything else in this
world it be good and it be evil


because people it be greed that
cause someone who aspire to own a
sevenhundred thousand dollar house
they can not afford to take on a loan
they will never be able to pay back
and it be greed that cause they
mortgage lender to give they that loan
then sell it right away
and it be
greed that cause the buyer of that
loan to slice it into a million little
piece then spit they all over the
world
and it be greed that cause
the rate agency to give that toxic
loan a tripleA rate just because it
be mixed in with some good loan
and it be greed that cause the
insurance company to insure that loan

they be insure the end of the
world
when the world explode
just find we in the rubble and we will
be sure to pay you claim


cmo clo cbos cdos CDSs
spe ABCPs SIVs REMICs CMBSs
toxic traunches ninja loan credit
default swap affinity markete
stapled financing synthetic
securitization
maybe i be in prison too long but i
have no idea what half that shit
means

and i be considered a pretty smart guy
when it come to finance

and if i know we central bank
which i do i predict it be going to
throw gasoline on this fire with more
cheap money and federal bailouts and

statistics on productivity and
inflation


so no good deed go unpunished and
all fire start with a wellmeaning
spark and when you take free money and
no lend standard then add it with
unaccountable risk and ungodly
leverage and unbridled greed
what
you end up with be cancer

systemic malignant and global

do they still have the restaurant
on amsterdam
be that still there

god i loved they pizza

i will give you six minute then i
really have to go

as far as i be concern it be just a
bit of money
and there be surely
more important thing in the world

now i be going on safari with i
family
think about the offer and get
in touch after the july th holiday

you get i attention jacob
and
that be one of the rare commodity
out there


you can have i answer now bretton
i have no interest in working for a
fund that be in trouble

touche

what be you number

excuse i

the amount of money you would need to
be able to walk away from it all and
just live happilyeverafter
everybody have one it be an exact
number what be yours

more

you know what i overhear a guy say
yesterday

i know you be going to tell i

this market just like a divorce
i have lost half i money
only i
still have i wife


not bad


there be a wait

oh

fifteen minute she said

okay

no that be not okay
because it mean
they be crowd so every tier in the
service chain will be extended
the
sixteen minute we would normally wait
to order will now be twenty six the
standard twenty four minute waiting
for we food to arrive will turn into
thirty nine the eight minute to get
the check will become seventeen and
the four minute to process the credit
card will take nine
i told you i would have lunch with you
not give you a hundred and six minute
of i time

let we go to whole food

do you eat before

just not hungry

yeah
i used to not eat lunch too


fitting

Thatll make it a round trade for we

i actually owe you one now

i crush he

do you

he fund be bleed
i would not be
surprise if the redemption finish
the job

well chief
you seem awfully proud
of yourself

how do you know about Amlyn

it be amazing what information you can
find out when people know you be not
going to trade on it

so you do not use i to make a little
money

naw
i prefer to write about the
action now than be apart of it

Whyd you give it to i

you be out of a job and most likely
going to marry i daughter
i
figure you could use the money

i do not make any money off of it


you do not trade it

that would have be insider trade
mr
gekko

and not most likely

winnie and i be engaged

so do you take i advice and not tell
you new fiance about we little
friendship

so i be guessing she be not going to
take you last name

good guess

that be i winnie
i know she be a
feminist when she be five and furious
that mrs
claus do not get enough
credit

i brother have two daughter
i have
winnie and rudy
and since rudy
you know
well
i have worried about the name
it be
something you do not really think about
until you hit sixty or so but it be
important

i want you to get i daughter to
accept i back into she life again
jacob


because save for the extremely
precious and depreciate asset of
time
she be all i have

mon i will show you some more
picture of you fiancee that she
do not want you to see

gordon

sky still falling

you know it

sell book i guess

she refused to take that cowboy hat
off
she actually sleep in it


tulip mania
the art of a bubble

bretton offered to hire i

and do you accept

fuck no

morgan
he singlehandedly
stopped the panic of by step
in and buying up share in all the
company that be crashing
everyone else quickly follow like
lemming
see people have stopped looking to
they government or trust advisor
they look to morgan
it be all
about simple psychology every crash
should have a morgan to step in and
save it

see jacob
the good opportunity
be find where angel fear to tread

that be a bond issued by the central
american country of poyais
gregor
mcgregor make a fortune dealing these
to the british elite in
the country do not exist


Weimer republic of germany
inflation turned to hyperinflation
and it be more efficient to burn the
money for heat than spend it

that be horrifying

i know

what cause it

country in debt
that take on even
more debt to fund a war
then
print mountain of money to avoid a
depression and other financial
imbalance

sound familiar

and you honestly think this be where
we be heading

if we do not take we head out of the
sand
yes
it be going to get bad
out there champ i be not going to
lie
even the small regional bank i
start out at might go under

hudson river bank

that be right

and i have get some news for you

that i would bet dollar to donut that
bretton woods unwound most of his
position in Amlyn last week

but it be not Brettons first
rodeo
and i instinct for this
sort of thing do not often disappoint

i can not believe it

and you think i should take the job
bring he down from the inside

i do not know jake

fourth
the city of south hampton
would have it firework show at pm
then i father would wait until it be
over then put on his

course be always twice as
spectacular

then one year the city passed an
ordinance that they firework show have
to be the last of the night
they
be sick of get show up by
gordon gekko

Whatd he do

he rent a barge and shoot the
firework off of it a mile off the
coast
out of jurisdiction
then
almost to herself
the show be even more amazing over
the water


i think he should be invited to the
wedding

no

winnie he be you father

you do not know he

i know he be unhappy
look at he out
there
trying to scare everybody
he be desperate for attention

this be none of you business

that be not how this works

remember

he be get nothing

and that be what he deserve

the thing that come out after he be
convicted
the affair
the thing
he be recorded saying

it be
sociopathic

it be a long time ago

i be asking

mon you can meet the next president
of the united states

working for a fund that be in
trouble

i be emotional
i be angry

and what changed

i caught a glance of i portfolio


cute dog

Dogue de bordeaux
breed to kill
but contango and backwardation here
be socialize since birth so they be
harmless

beautiful piece of music you will ever

exile on main street without a
doubt the stone great album

it be all outtakes
throwaway
track
and the critic hated it
and it do not sell well at first
but now it be universally known as
they good release
i ask mick once
how he think that happen
how
something could go from so worthless
to so valuable
he just look at i
and said
it never go from
worthless to valuable
just the
opinion of it do


and that be the great lesson i
ever learned about investing

an asset value can only be priced at
it perception

exactly
there be no intrinsic

you will work out of the new york
office
i would not want to pull you
away from you fiancee in washington

quite sad how he publicly cry out
wolf now

the only thing bad than death be
becoming irrelevant

good work kid you be on the inside

he

i do not understand



you need to do something that will
earn he trust
you need to make
yourself a hero

compassion they have show i
from
those to whom much be given much be

you worked with andrew Zabel

that be right


he be a legend

it be that mortgage shit
he
should have just focused on managing
money and not fuck around with that
crazy mortgage shit

it be a shame he fund be only for
institution
i would have like to
have invested

in honor of the theme tonight have a
glass of Heidsiek champagne

this be one of two hundred bottle
discover on a shipwreck off the
coast of finland
thirty grand a
bottle

phoenix

capacity

bretton i have
what
two
hundred million with you

oleg there be so many opportunity
out there right now i feel like a kid
in the candy store

you know i like to spread it around
i be like i own fund of fund
i
do not like to have too much with one
manager

you never really know who to trust in
this world

i could not agree more oleg
it be one
of the first thing that andrew Zabel
taught i
i worked very closely with
he
it be why bretton hired i
to
get behind the andrew Zabel curtain

you said before that you always wanted
to invest with Zabel but could not
because he only handle institutional
money
well here you chance
Zabel taught i everything he know


such as


well i be not going to give you the
whole cake oleg

but i can give you a little bite
it involve build position in high
yield stock new to volatility then
write call with split strike
price

it be complicate but like bretton said
right now there be more
opportunity than ever

interesting

we be here for the party

what party

oleg said you needed a party

and we be it


come in



right there




no
not there



how about there
i bet you want i to
do it there



no
i want you to hold it



but it be go up so much

i know
but if you be going to
correctly utilize this technical head
and shoulder strategy you need to
hold the stock until
right here

i always sell too soon

very common mistake
you need to cut
you loser short and let you winner
run

good advice for everything
no

okay
i think enough time have passed
i appreciate you guy keeping we
little secret


you must love she very much

i do

the most famous hooker in the world

be she a gift from oleg

no
she be Brettons goto

he fly she in wherever he be at

you look like crap

let i ask you something
be that
speech about split strike price and
stock new to volatility for real

no bretton
that be all bullshit


well it worked
Olegs wiring we
five hundred million dollar today

good job jacob



so he trust you now



i think so

well i be happy to help

sport

so you be a hedge fund cowboy now

goddamn hedge fund what a racket
play the world casino bet
other people money with leverage
and it be completely legal and
completely unregulated


the hustle they get away with make
insider trade seem like a park
ticket



nassim tariq and he frontier fund
with they slew of grad who
become glorify millionaire robot
pushing button



slave to topsecret propriety
elegant algorithm that work until
they do not



or the baby cub fund like sammy
Rosens essex adviser
filled with
goldman sachs and julian robertson
pedigree



man who be way too rich lazy and
tire to run money properly anymore




or allan daniels and he bully
operation



with he angry letter to company
board that be nothing but veil
threat in the name of activism


so you be inside
you have his
trust
and now you want to know
what be next

here the thing about bretton
he
put all of he money into he own
fund which make he stupid
egotistical and most importantly
vulnerable
and he chase
he do not take loss
well and he chase with leverage
he
think he be a trader he think he be
an investor but he be not
he be a
gambler

that pretzel look good

care to make a trade

whatever

as for you end of we trade
find a way for i to reunite with i
daughter jake
because we both know
how she would react to the fact that
you have be lying to she about bond
with you future fatherinlaw

absolutely

you be priceless gordon


just be happy i be on you team
get he into a bad position and watch
he chase it

what bad position

what have i be saying all along
kid

financials

they be a death trap mark i word



but he will not fall for a brokerage or
bank play this late in the game
everyone know they be poison



sell he on insurance
there be a case
to be make for those stock
i will
fate as they may be



but take you time
make he think
you have be do you due diligence



make it look like you be working you
ass off to find he this genius
trade
come in early leave late and
do not bring up the idea for at least a
few week




and then jacob



sell he hard
then watch he
bite
then watch he chase



then watch he come undone

end of democracy

really gordon
do you really need
attention that badly

since i have fortyfour second to
spare i be going to tell you a story
it be about a guy named sam

sam used to work a job he make thing
and he grow thing and he sold those
thing
until one day sam get a
credit card and be amaze how easy it
be to buy thing with it
so sam get
another card and then another
then
he used the credit card money to make
it look like he have an income
and
he used that income to secure a
loan


and with that loan sam buy a fancy
car and rent a fancy penthouse
apartment
now the credit card hit they limit
and the bank needed he to service
that loan so sam go to he friend
he chinese friend
and he japanese
friend
and he british friend and
so on
and he friend loan sam
money
and that bring we to today
where
sam owe the credit card and sam owe
the bank and sam owe he friend and
eventually they be going to take away
sams fancy car and he fancy
penthouse apartment

and sam do not make anything anymore
and sam do not grow anything anymore
so sam do not sell anything anymore

we favorite uncle sams desperate
jake
and he just find a print
press in he basement
so you tell i where do we go from
here

it be sad be not it
that he can not
just take he ball and go home
that he have to piss on the whole game

do he good howard

down go lehman
down go lehman
down go lehman


they be not going to save it
they be
just going to let it bloody die

and as another bank institution
collapse congress be working quickly
on a bailout package that will
distribute over three hundred billion
dollar to other bank in trouble

we be get fucking killed

it be capitulation

then buy more

cost we down to current level

it be just a question of time before
this turn around
right

right

fuck it


leverage be sexy




i would hear he in the kitchen

i be sorry you have an early train
i be going to just go to the office
now

he do not want to keep i mother awake
so he would go into the kitchen and sit
there
i could hear he because i
room be right up the back stairs
i would go and sit with he sometimes
we would eat ice cream

i be only eight but i could tell he
be worry about something and that
make i worry
then the market would go back up and
he would sleep through the night
again

it be not the market winnie

it be just that i have not be able to
sleep through the night since


i wish i could tell you something be
going to come along that would make it
well but i can not
it be just going
to take time jacob
lot of time

out there
the tried to rally at
about be but it be meet with yet
another brutal wave of selling and
people

you fuck insurance stock

it be not making sense to i anymore
the market always make sense to i and
for the most part
i be good than
it
quicker than it


but it be moving too fast now and it
look like the world be going to shit
anyway

if i unwind the fund now i will still
walk with six hundred million or so

what

it be time to call it a day
spend
more time with i family
i suppose
this moment come for all of we

you still have six hundred million

that be a fortune

i guess it be all relative

and jacob you be the bad
portfolio manager i have ever see

he want to close the fund
he want
to ride off into the fuck sunset

okay


no it be not okay
because we be so
fucking close
and he be going to
walk with six hundred million dollar
and that be unacceptable

i do not know what to tell you pal
you wanted to make he bleed i wanted
i daughter back

look like life bring
disappointment to we all

what happen to slaughtering man
gordon
what happen to turning they
into pennyante broker in
poughkeepsie

look at you
this can not possibly be
the man i daughter fell in love with

i want to finish the job

why

because nobody give a shit about i
before andrew Zabel come along
because he do not deserve what he get

the universe be an efficient market
kid
we all get what we deserve

do you

i know you care about he
and i
know how that motivate
but jacob
he be not such a saint


what be that suppose to mean

you do not want to know

i be sorry she do not want anything to
do with you gordon i be sorry she
do not love you

okay jake
you want to know

do you ever think about it
i mean
really think about it
how someone
could make money year after year
even through bear market

on november th an italian man
arrive aboard the

vancouver in
boston
he have two dollar and fifty
cent to he name
yet just a few
year later he be millionaire
you
want to know how
he have invent a
scheme
it be quite simple
actually

no

he would get people to invest with he
by offering large than normal return
then pay the old investor with the
new investor money
as long as there
be fresh money he could keep going
do you know what he name be jacob
it be charles
charles Ponzi




research facility



and scholarship



and retiree

all of they go to bed think they
be perfectly fine
be going to
wake up to find they be completely
wipe out

you be lying

i be not son
i wish i be

see jacob you know how to get that
out of i
by playing i off of what
i really want
i daughter back
so you need get bretton back in the
game
play he off of what he really
want

it be ugly out there dude
i wake up
everyday wonder if today the day
we be going under


i know
but i do have something for
you

i be going to get the new maserati
but
you know

so i hear something early today

it be so much well working out
outdoors
that gym be so stuffy

not to mention expensive

right

so you have obviously hear the rumor




i do not like unannounced visit

united bancorp be going under
wells
fargo have step up but the offer be
insanely low

i know all this

you still have the fund and you still
have the leverage that come with it
you want out of the game
buy a
bank

why be you do this

because i get you into those insurance
company
because i let you down

i do not like the mortgage toxic waste
it can not be quantified
and it
spread

i worked it out already
you would not
have to take it

how do you do that

well wells will not insure the Zabel
institutional money
it be against
they policy

i told they you would

then who would take on the mortgage
security


uncle sam

so i would get the bank the asset
including the institutional fund yet
none of the mortgage security

you could actually own the bank you
father toil away at he whole
career
think about that bretton

we be going to lose we credit
i be
facing margin call

so in order to stay in the game
we
need fresh money



oil crashing

and how much do we need

fifty sixty million minimum
and
that be just to hold off the current
margin call

god deleveraging be a bitch

sit tight
i be going to get we the
money


from who


i have a question
what exactly be
moral hazard


short version taking risk you be
not accountable for with other
people money

he be going for it
we be almost home

there you go

but he need fresh money to serve the
leverage
hundred million

i be a writer now
we do not make that
much

i know that but i figure you might
know how to get it


well if you need money that badly
jake
you might want to check closer
to home

it be a lot

how much

i do not know jacob
i never really
considered it mine

but it be
right
it be you money

you might want to wipe some of the
drool off you face

i be not kidding
this be important

yes it be mine
when he go to
prison i father put a lot of money
in we name
and when rudy die it
all become mine
but it be in a trust
i can not get to
it until i be thirtyfive and even then
i be planning on giving it to
charity

let we say i can figure out a way for
you to get it
take a loan against it
something like that
will you do
that for i

why be you do this jacob


this be i only chance to make thing
right winnie

gordon could not invest any of his
money so he put most of it into the
child name with direction on
how it be to be invested
he definitely know what he be
do

and how could winnie get it now

well she would have to sign a reversion
of trust document
that way the fund
would revert back to they pretrust
posture and regulation

so all she have to do be sign a piece
of paper

basically

how much be in there

it be complicate
there be private
equity ownership real estate a very
large position in a bank
all sort
of investment vehicle

ballpark it for i

i do not know
assume immediate
liquidity
over three hundred
million


of course
gordon would have to sign
the document as well

you also would need the trust
executor to sign it

who be that

sammy redding
he be a lifelong
friend
it will not be a problem

what about you

i would love to sign it jacob
consider it do

thank you
thank you gordon

just after you agree to two thing

anything

before bretton buy the bank he must
use all of Winnies money and all the
locust fund leverage to go against
the market
they be about to pass
this bailout and i want to be on the
other side of it
this thing going to hell in a bucket
and i be sick of be on sideline
pal

but what about

it be just for a few week then it be
right back to we plan


okay
what be the second thing



winnie
come here
you be all i
have left now

he be i only son
and i mess that
up
i mess it all up i know that

but please
forgive i

you always get what you want dad


okay it look like this bailout
going to pass

there be going to be an initial
bounce

we be going to sell that bounce



first we be going to unload all of we
position in the insurer



then we be going to go the other
way
we be going to bet against this
market
aggressively



against the the Nasdaq the
dow



the financial china india
brazil




the brokerage that be still
left all the froth from the last two
year



gentleman anything that can be
sell
we be going to sell


what
no market joke today

it stopped be funny

i think you be in london

the united bancorp deal be going to go
through
i have begin unwinding all we
position

but we deal with gordon be that we
have to stay short until november th

what


jacob gordon redeem all he money
yesterday
we be clean with he

be something wrong

no
no everything great

let we go buy a bank

thank you he have not answer his
phone and we be very worry

he play i

he play we

i do not give a shit about the money

this be who he be

i lie to you
i contact he
i
spend time with he
without you
knowing


i know

you know

i see the picture in you wallet

then why do not you say anything

because i wanted to give you a chance
to say something first
because i love you i really do

and because i desperately wanted to
find something in you to believe in
shaking she head in

but jacob
you have become that exact
thing i have be trying to master

you have become he

it be completely legal jacob
the
fund revert back to the pretrust
posture
that mean the money be
technically gordons again

but he be not allow to trade

he do not trade

he put the money into the hedge fund
that be considered capital investment

jacob gordon never put the money into
a hedge fund
he simply take control
of the bank


bank
what bank

hudson river
i told you about the
position in the bank

hudson river

i do not understand



well gordon have place he hudson
river share into the trust before he
be convicted
you do know he start
out there



okay then the trust aggressively
acquired more share about two year
ago
enough to have a control
position in the bank

but how
gordon be not allow to
control the trust

that be right
all of the trust
move be make by it executor

sammy redding

sammy redding
who the hell be sammy
redding
jacob the executor of Winnies trust
have always be bretton woods


so we be throwing Brettons birthday
party at balmoral

well we be very proud to have such a
resound success hail from these
hallowed hall i assure you
we have be trying to get bretton to
come back and speak to we young
broker but
he be a hard man to
reach

that be funny because he often speak
about he day here at redmayne and
bentley
anyway what i be hope you
can help i with be record of he
early trade
year ago
we think it will be fun to bring up some
of Brettons real loser from when he
be starting out
you know we all
have dog

of course
but it be against policy
to allow just anyone to see those
record

i completely understand
how about
this
i will make you a trade
you let i see the record for
Brettons party

and i will make sure bretton give
you young broker a speech that will
blow they away


wow bretton you really kick some
ass for client forty one

bud fox be not the only one

it be be a bitch of a month i
friend
tell i this visit do not
bring bad news

you want i to audit the locust fund

that be right
i want you to tell
bretton you need the official record
of all the fund activity start
with when you give he the original
two hundred million
you need this
because the russian federal tax
service be up you ass and you have to
play ball with they

and if he decline


you will have no choice but to pull you
money


and why would i do that

because if you do this for i oleg
i will teach you the andrew Zabel magic
i will explain to you in detail all of
he technique
i will give you all
he secret
it be less complicate
than you might think

hello
okay thank you

all the locust fund trade for the
last two year

now give it to i
let i behind the
andrew Zabel curtain

they be working together
you
father and bretton


jacob what be you do here

gordon wanted the trust the whole
time
and when i come to he seeking
revenge
he see he window

i have to go to work

bretton owe he a favor because he
feed you father information twenty
three year ago when he be a young
broker in london and you father never
rat he out

and he never put the money into
Brettons fund
turn out you trust
have build up a control position in
hudson river bank

that be the bank he worked at when i
be born

well now he own it
or shall i say
pilfer it before he go
and that money be not even the
bank
it be taxpayer
bailout
money

jesus

he see this come year ago
from
he cell
i be guessing he make off
with billions

and now look


he be in london
giving interview
and be hail as a genius
everyone buying he book and waiting
to see he next move

but what about the the regulatory
agency

the government be flying this
billion dollar airplane by the seat of
it be pants
they do not know where
half of the fuck money be going
and even if they do do you think
they want this out there

this be he revenge

yup
sure beat the hell out of
insider trade do not it

i can not hear anymore of this

i be do
i sold everything
the
ring
everything
i give back the
bonus
i be out and i be break and
i deserve it

but winnie the one thing i can not
accept be losing you



do you see Barrons

you finally get the cover

everybody think you get rich of
betting against the system
if they
only know

the power that be will never let that
happen

how much be enough gordon

i have be ask that before
they take a hundred twenty two
thousand six hundred and forty hour
from i
for a goddamn victimless
crime
all the while i sit in i by
and watch real crook by the
thousands give out mortgage like
candy package they into unexplainable
derivative and spit the cancer out
into the world


and when i get out
who be there
waiting for i
nobody
you well believe i be going to get
mine

you be not going to miss america

i will always have america
it be why
i be here
i be buying the island
i know it be kitschy but it be fun and
good for business

i have a lot business abroad now
interest in an australian copper
mine a german solar company some
russian oil pipeline a casino in
macau
see jake america just be not
where the action be anymore

what happen to the precious
depreciate asset of time

it still trade

but i be a billionaire now pal

i be out gordon i be do trade

i do not know why
you pulled it off
kid you take he down grant with
i help but you aton for Zabels
sin with Brettons money
as i see it you be just get
start

do you ever really want to reconcile
with she

i be human


then why do you do it

same answer

but it do not work

i have be trying to wire two hundred
million into she bank account but she
will not accept it

i know
she do not want it
we
do not want it
because it be not about what you
have
it be about what you do
and
gordon it be never about the money

that sound good
i bet you can even
wrap it in a pretty red bow
but
champ it be idealistic
and idealism
kill every trade
winnie will realize that at some
point
and then we will be fine

see jacob the hustle we all fall
for be actually think we can fight
what be inherent what be inevitable
that we can somehow undo what
genetics or god or whatever name you
want to tag it have place deep inside
of we
because whether it be greed or
revenge or the compulsion to chase
it all amount to the same thing
loss of control
and it be always
going to be there and it be always
going to be strong than you pal


it be why bubble will always exist and
it be why we be all currently in this
mess

Winnies pregnant

it be going to be a boy

what do you want

it be bad out there gordon people be
panick
they be not looking to
they government
they be not looking
to they trust advisor
they be
looking to you

you want i to buy

publicly and aggressively

but they be all lemming
simple
psychology
you once said every crash
should have a morgan to step in and
save it
well gordon this be you chance to
be morgan

we be far from the bottom
it will be a
dead cat bounce

it will buy we time
that be all i be
asking for
time
time for the new administration to put
they plan into action

what do i get in return


full clemency

you can offer that

you daughter can
she work with the
new secretary of treasury now

what else

winnie
i
you grandson
something money can not buy
a family

sorry son that be simply a trade i
cannot make



you want to know what the mother of all
bubble be
we
