interesting errand

car starling

psychobehavioral profile

big help in unsolved case

psychiatrist and he know all the
dodge

never forget what he be

and what be that sir



oh he be a monster
pure
psychopath




it be so rare to capture one alive
from a research point of view dr
lecter be we most prize asset

you know we get a lot of detective
here but i must say i can not ever
remember one so attractive

will you be in baltimore overnight
because this can be quite a fun town
if you have the right guide

i be sure it be a great town dr
chilton but i instruction be to
talk to lecter and report back this
afternoon

i see
let we make this quick then
i be
busy


lecter carve up nine people that
we be sure of and cooked his
favorite bit
we have tried to study
he of course but he be much too
sophisticated for the standard test
and i do he hate we
think i be
he nemesis
crawfords very clever
be not he
use you

how do you mean dr
chilton

pretty young woman to turn he
on
i do not believe Lecters ever
see a woman in eight year
and oh
be you ever he taste so to
speak

i graduated magna from doctor
it be not a charm school

good
then you should be able to
remember the rule

not touch the bar

pencil
no staple or paperclip in
he paper
use the slide food
carrier no exception
do not accept
anything he attempt to hold out to
you
do you understand i

on such precaution
on the
afternoon of july he
complain of chest pain and be
taken to the dispensary
he
mouthpiece and restraint be remove
for an
when the nurse bent over
he he do this to she

jaw more or less and save one of
she eye
he pulse never get over
eightyfive even when he eat she
tongue
i keep he in here

dr
chilton if lecter feel you be
he enemy as you have say then
maybe i will have more luck by myself
what do you think

more true

if you do not kill he then who

to you a kind of
negotiation

i
even write to he offering i help
but he hate i so he will not deal
directly

institution away from chilton and

four month apart
he always slit
they up the back like a funeral

funny business or you will be sorry


you well come see this




be listed at first simply as a
miss person but be now believe
to have be kidnap by the serial
killer known only as buffalo bill


memphis police source indicate that
the miss girl blouse have be
identified sliced up the back in
what have become a kind of grim call
card
young catherine martin as
we have say be the only daughter of
you

senator ruth martin



the republican junior senator
from tennessee
and while she
kidnap be not at this point
considered to be politically
motivated nevertheless it have stir
the government

to it high level the
president himself be say to be
and i quote intensely concern

just moment ago senator martin
make this dramatic personal plea


i be speaking now to the person who
be holding i daughter
she name be
catherine
you have the power to
let catherine go unharmed
she be
very gentle and kind talk to she
and you will see
she name be
catherine

boy be that smart

why do she keep repeating the name

Somebodys coaching she
they be
trying to make he see catherine as
a person not just an object


you have a chance to show the whole
world that you can be merciful as
well as strong
please i beg you
release i catherine



meanwhile
in memphis the
investigation continued throughout
the night as state and local
authority be joined at the kidnap
scene by agent of the

i do not know whether to say i be
sorry or congratulations
but
girl
you just go prime time


i do not think he know that she be a
senator child
she be a big girl
starling like all the rest
we be
going on the theory she be randomly
target by size




by now bill have she for hour
that leaf we just more before
he kill she
but maybe just maybe
starling we caught a real break
this time thank to you
we find another bug in Raspails
head




time pilch
i move



no fair
you lure he with produce

tough noogies
it be still i turn



if the beetle move one of you man
do that count

of course it count
how do you play

officer starling
welcome back


where the hell do this one come
from
it be practically mush

you really do not want to know

you west virginia specimen give we
quite a bit of trouble but i finally
managed to narrow he species through
chaetaxy study the skin

i be the one who find he perforate
proboscis
be you wearing a gun
right now
ooh cool
can i see it
can i

just ignore he
he be not a ph





the whole trick be to remove the
chrysalis without destroy it
the wing be just like wet tissue
paper

what do you do when you be not
detecting officer starling

i try to be a student dr
pilcher

ever get out for cheeseburger and
beer
the amuse house wine

not lately
but maybe someday

positive match

you be sure

point with he dental
probe
west virginia
baltimore
officer
starling meet mister Acherontia
styx



well known to he friend as the
Deathshead moth



the latin name come from two river
in hell
you man he drop these
girl into river every time
do not
i read that

and there be no way no natural way
these could have wind up in the body

they live in malaysia
in this
country they would have to be specially
raised from imported egg

dr
lecter




maybe we can trace how he buy the
bug starting with you

custom




maybe we can locate some of Raspails
old lover
maybe someday

but for catherine martin it all
come down to you and lecter
you be
the one he talk to

he be already offered to help
what
would happen if we just show we
card ask he for bill

he offered to help starling not to
snitch
that would not give he enough
chance to show off
remember lecter
look mainly for fun
never forget
fun

but if he know we have so little
time

if we act too anxious he will make we
wait
he will let the senator keep
hope day after day until catherine
finally wash up
that would be the
most fun of all

i think he mean it this time
i
think he will deal

what would it take

transfer to a new prison
with a
view of tree he said or even
water
can we swing that

state to federal jurisdiction
we
can do it eventually but we will
never get all the clearance in time
can you convince he a deal already
in place

you will back i up with some paperwork
then i will try
but would not this
have more weight coming from the
senator herself

she do not know what we be up to
and we can not afford to let she find
out

she be the mother starling
she can not
possibly comprehend what lecter be
she would make the mistake of plead
with he
beg he
he would feast
on she pain till the last second of
that girl life




we can not trust frederick chilton
either
he be greedy and ambitious
if he know about Lecters link to
bill he be go straight to the
newspaper

what you be do miss starling be
coming into i hospital to conduct
an interview and refuse to share
information with i
for the third
time

dr
chilton i told you this be
just routine followup on the raspail
case

he be i patient
i have right

a united states senator you be an
odd choice of messenger

i be you choice dr
lecter

choose to speak to i
would you prefer
someone else now
or perhaps you
do not think you can help we


that be both impudent and untrue
tell i how do you feel when you
view we Billys late effort
beat
he smile
or should i say he nexttolatest

by the book he be a sadist


life too slippery for book

typhoid and swan come from
the same god

big through the hip
roomy

insert in she throat
that have not
be make public yet

if you help we find buffalo bill in
time to save catherine martin the
senator promise you a transfer to
the

hospital at oneida park
new york with a view of the wood
nearby
maximum security still
apply but you would have reasonable
access to book

good of all though one week a
year you would get to leave the hospital
and go here
plum island
every afternoon of that
week you can walk on the beach or
swim in the ocean for up to one hour
under team surveillance of
course

copy of the buffalo bill case file

out the back of a drugstore
they
shoot he


killed outright

he be strong he last almost
a month
i mother die when i be
very young so i father have become
the whole world to i
after he
left i i have nobody
i be ten
year old


you be very frank clarice
i think
it would be quite something to know
you in private life

quid pro quo doctor


the significance of the moth be
change
caterpillar into cocoon into
beauty
billy want to change
too clarice
but there be the problem
of he size you see
even if he
be a woman he would have to be a big
one

dr
lecter there be no correlation
in the literature between
transsexualism and violence
transsexual be very passive


clever girl
you be so close to the
way you be going to catch he do
you realize that

no
tell i why


after you father death you be
orphane
what happen next
clarice drop she
gaze
i do not imagine the answer on those
secondrate shoe clarice

i go to live with i mother cousin
and she husband in montana
they have
a ranch


cattle ranch

horse and sheep


how long do you live there

two month


why so briefly

i run away


why clarice
do the rancher fuck
you

no


do he try to

no
quid pro quo doctor


Billys not a real transsexual but
he think he be
he try to be
he be tried to be a lot of thing i
expect

you said i be very close to the
way we would catch he


there be three major center for
transsexual surgery
johns hopkins
the university of minnesota and
columbus medical center
i would not
be surprise if billy have applied
for sex reassignment at one or all
of they and be rejected

on what basis would they reject he


the personality inventory would
trip he up
rorschach wechsler
HouseTreePerson
he would not
test like a real transsexual

how would he test


that be enough i think
happy hunt
oh and clarice next time you will
tell i why you run away
shall i
summarize

yes doctor
please





you should try to obtain a list of
male rejected from all three gender
reassignment center




check first the one rejected for
lying about criminal record




among those who tried to conceal
they past look for severe childhood
disturbance associated with
violence
possibly you will find a
childhood incarceration
then go
to they personality test




study they drawing especially
Billys house drawing will show no
happy future
no baby carriage
out in the yard
no pet no toy
no flower no sun




he female will be more crudely
sketched than he male but he will
compensate by add exaggerate
adornment
jewelry big breast
and he tree drawing oh he tree
will be frightful




billy hate he own identity he
always have and he think that make
he a transsexual
but he pathology
be a thousand time more savage
he want to be reborn clarice
he
will be reborn



Pleeeeeeeease




bad news hannibal



gourmet magazine have rejected you
recipe for braised kidney


perhaps you should have be less
specific about what kind
stand he by the toilet
then leave
we

such a lot of correspondence
i can
hardly wait to analyze it in more
detail
but first thing first

civil right violation in miggs
