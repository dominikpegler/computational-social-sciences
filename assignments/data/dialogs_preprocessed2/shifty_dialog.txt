large empty coach all dull beige seat and wood veneer
make it way along a stretch of motorway



at the back of the coach we see a lone passenger
he eye
close head droop
suddenly he raise a hand and rub the
bridge of he nose
it be no use chris can not sleep
he
pull up a set of head phone put they on and press play
on he



long shot from the front of the coach the driver gruff
face to the leave empty seat filtering away from camera
chris head peak above a back seat
we hear the music
from he begin to play
it be noel McKoys bright day
a northern soul track that be reminiscent of motown and
comparable to the vocal sound of marvin gaye
the track will play over the follow open scene the
credit fade subtly in and out in white text



we follow from behind as a hooded character walk with intent
through Dudlowe
a sprawl new town build in the fifties to
house the east end after the second world war

we reveal shifty pakistani as he make he way through
those morning street
he blow on he hand to warm they up

suddenly he duck down and nip through an open in a
fence making a short cut



bird eye view on trevor perry average looking thickset
pallid skin lying beneath the surface of the bath water
holding he nose








chris stare out of the window
the music still playing on
he
the coach make a sharp left turn the camera just
catching a glimpse of the sign




glen a severe almost cruel face empty about a kilo of
cocaine onto a clean glass table



jasmine pretty with out make up dressed in a white
dressing gown prepare breakfast



shifty make he way across a patch of waste land jumping
over a fence at the end



suddenly jasmine lurch toward the sink and vomit



in an agreeably decorate bedroom trevor dress for work
he
climb into he thick check shirt and jeans no real
enthusiasm life seem to hold no motivation



chris watch out the window as the coach pass the same
strip of waste land shifty just walk across


glen split the cocaine into two pile



trevor sit on the edge of the bed stare at the floor
he
mind be racing think about the morning ahead of he




jasmine wash away the sick with a jug of water



the coach pull away to reveal chris he bag sling over his
shoulder

he turn and walk off


trevor look at he self in the bathroom mirror he rub his
face he seem a little more with it



glen open a tub of glucose and empty a measure into one
half of the cocaine
he mix it carefully



shifty open a back gate and walk towards a house



chris make he way through the street bag sling over his
shoulder
he look around at the old place
soak it in



glen take a spoon of cocaine from the unmixed half and mix
it with citric acid
he suck it up into a syringe



shifty quietly open the back door to the house



glen carry the syringe to loretta pretty but with bad
facial burn on the side of she face
he inject the cocaine
mix into she arm
she lay back on the bed taking on the
rush




chris walk along a residential road in he hand a piece of
paper with a scribble address
he find the right house
he
stand there for a moment then hit stop on he
we
soulful soundtrack come to an end
he pull down he head
