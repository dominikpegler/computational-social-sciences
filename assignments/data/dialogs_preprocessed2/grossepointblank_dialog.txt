the only
meaning and value be what we create
through structure and discipline
though they seem to limit we freedom
they actually give we great comfort

like
king phillip in the th or th
century who decided one day that he
be so bore with he dreary life at
home with he wife he think well
would not it be great if we hit the
road and fight
oh
the
saracen
so he put the word out
and be amaze when a million man
signed up and all of they wanted to
go and fight in distant land and do
terrible thing to people rather
than stay at home with they family

company
we execute economic
investment opportunity
sort of
economic cleanup
with an emphasis
on personnel
it be bore you know
it be bore
i do not like to talk
about it because i do not think what
a man do necessarily reflect who
he be

i have always tried to refrain from
a blackandwhite moral lexiconyou
know good bad right wrongI have
be more interest in the gray
area

but that be no way to live
i guess
you have get to just take the leap of
faith
believe in something
fuck
it

sound complicate martin
be you
happy

i just have to close this one last
account
i would like to just stop now
today but i can not
it be a step in
the right direction

i do not know martin
it sound like
you be feeling compromise
live the
way you want
the only thing that be
inexcusable to i be cynicism
that be the big copout there be

barbecue sauce

what do you think about black coach
in the darius
because i think
it be great

i do not pay much attention to
football

i have to agree with you dennis
it be good to see that the owner be
will to put the franchise behind
a black head coach or when for
year in the league they have be
keep out of the think position
and relegate mainly to the physical
game

but now you see you have warren
moon at the helm cunningham art
she will and the coach up at
minnesota

dennis green
and if you remember
doug williams be the first black
man to prove that on a superbowl
sunday

i be teaching art at cedar junior
high school

about five year now

get the fuck outta here

seriously when i left i joined the
army and take the service exam
they
find i psych result fit a certain
profile
certain moral flexibility
would be the good way to describe
it
i be loan out to a
sponsor program
it be called
mechanical operation
we sort of
find each other

you be a government spook

i be but no
yes
i be before
but now i be not
it be irrelevant
really
the idea of government
nation it be mostly a public
relation theory at this point
anyway
but i will tell you something
until about five month ago i really
enjoy i work

jesus christ

then i start losing i taste for
it
which usually mean you time be
up
but then i realized it be
something entirely different
i
start get the sneak dark
suspicion that maybe there be
meaning to life

okay
great martin that be just
great
meaning to life
mmm

like that there be a point
an organic
connection between all live thing

let i help you along martin
you be
a sociopath

sociopath kill for no reason
i
kill for money

you never could have keep this from
i

i be leaving

that be probably a good idea

will you come with i

i be staying here

what if i come back

i will hide

do not go

you do not get to have i
you be a
monster i be a human being

you

well i be hired to kill you
it be
what i do and come to think of it
i told you that but
okay
i be
not going to do it
get in the car

it be either because i be in love with
you daughter or because i have a
newfound respect for life
or both
but i do not know

that punk be either in love with
that guy daughter or he have new
find respect for life
let we go

why
i build car
they be paying
you to kill i
why

it be a costcutting effort
they
can not afford a recall

it be a leaky sunroof
design
flaw
i reported a leaky sunroof
you want to kill i because of that

it be not i
why do everybody think
it be personal

we will go in through the wood

i be sitting in i house on prom

tuxedo a corsage in one hand a
bottle of champagne in the other
so
i be just sitting there and then
the whole night flash before i
eye and it strike i like a bullet
in the head i realized finally
and for the first time that
i
wanted to kill somebody
so i figure
because i loved you so much that would
it would be a good idea if i do not see
you anymore
but now i be different

i be in love with you
i know we can
make this work

i be afraid to commit to a
relationship but now i know i be
ready to make it happen

i just need time to change

it be not easy for i
i be raised
to close off to control i
feeling

lock the door

i be not raised in a love
environment
but that be not an excuse
it be a
reason

i soul be empty

and it be up to i to fill it

it be okay
it be martin the door begin
to open revealing debi and newberry

i know what i do be not moral per
se but if you could just look past
that you would see a man worth loving



do not listen to he he be a
professional



you be breaking i heart down here
blank
i can not shoot through the
tear
