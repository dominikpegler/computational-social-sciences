good afternoon

Tsi tien mr
bond

Tsi tien professor wu

you be watch the Harmsway
hour news network
coming up
mortise shot of

valentin Zukofskys stun victory in
the ukrainian presidential election
mortise shot of

live coverage of the late
communication satellite launch from
Xichang china
and
mortise shot of

special report on the situation in
hong kong since the chinese take
over from great britain


to sum up
after analyze the tire
inflation of the forklift in the
video tape believe the red
box contain approximately eighty
kilogram of weapon grade
uranium an incredibly hard
incredibly heavy incredibly lethal
substance

and that be enough enrich uranium to
produce how many nuclear device


depend on the builder sophistication
one crude bomb that could devastate
london paris new york berlin or all
four if they have the late technology

and the participant


kim dae yung
Moscowtrained north
korean nuclear weapon specialist
apparently fell out of favor with the
current north korean regime after a
botch attempt to steal fissionable
material from a british lightwater
reactor in south africa an accident
that left he entirely hairless


and Rendera Sikrahm also known as
richard stamper
freelance mercenary
laos and cambodia
he father be
from nepal a Ghurka warrior con
script by the british government to
fight in china during world war
after which the family settled in
hong kong where the young stamper
be undoubtedly treated like a second
class citizen by both the hong kong
chinese and local british
beat aside

we have all read about the sign at the
british swim pool in hong kong
that said no Ghurkas allow


nothing like a little imperialism to
promote loyalty among the faithful


stifle a smile then

in conclusion
both these man have a
vendetta against the world
they be
nuclear arm and dangerous
and
have failed to get the through
the old opium route the khyber pass
it be NATOs belief that they next
attempt will be through bulgaria
where the nuclear strike force
will be there to stop they

moneypenny
we have get to stop meet
like this
they may be on to we

hello james
enjoy you meet

in the dark moment it be what i
live for
especially since i have
hear how much you like to watch
on the hide camera

by the way james
ordinarily i would
never ask but
be not you and
that colonel once stranded on a raft
for two week in the sargasso sea

moneypenny
how indiscreet
have
you ever known i to kiss and tell

actually i have never known you to do
either
but

we all want what we can not have

not all of we

what no lust for adventure

no
it be just that i have learned
from personal experience that when
we get what we want
somehow the reality be never as
satisfy as the fantasy

do not keep waiting

come in
you know the minister

of course
minister johnstone



tell i what do you know about
elliot Harmsway

only what i read in the newspaper

he newspaper

occasionally yes
british media mogul
born in hong kong
control newspaper radio cable
satellite
book magazine movie
computer software
theme park

holding up a copy of

along with tomorrow the first
worldwide newspaper
circulation
million
daily


able to topple government with a single
story as he say in he press

exactly

what be Harmsway do

it seem we have received a tip

rumor from an anonymous source

that sir elliot may be involved
with stamper and yung and the
miss uranium

hearsay
idle chatter from a source
you can not identify who insist on
talking only to
nothing but
loose talk and innuendo

that may be the case at present
minister johnstone
but we own
source suspect that mr
Harmsway
used he considerable russian media
holding to elect valentin Zukofsky
president of the ukraine in trade
for the uranium

more scurrilous unsubstantiated gossip

perhaps
but it do explain how an
exKGB agent turned illegalarms
dealer be suddenly portray as a
longtime friend of the people
if you believe what you read in the paper

need i remind the two of you that
elliot Harmsway sir elliot Harmsway
be directly descend from the earl
of aberdeen
that he scottish
ancestor practically invent hong
kong and out of sheer gratitude
queen victoria herself named the port
aberdeen harbor in they honor

long pause then

no more than i need remind you
minister that merely be a member
of the lucky sperm club do not
preclude one from a life of criminal
activity

the reason i invited the minister
here be to reassure he that
this investigation will be handle
with the utmost discretion

of course

which be also why i have withhold this
information from and we ally

do not we once investigate Harmsway

yes

he be furious at the
british plan to return hong kong and
supposedly start he own negotiation
with the chinese government
the inquiry
go nowhere but it do earn a
rather powerful enemy

not to mention the chaos it cause at
whitehall when he newspaper begin
screaming for the recall of the
sitting government

a beat then

i be sending you to venice
you be to check out the source
determine whether elliot Harmsway be
involved with the enrich uranium
and if so stop he

how will i meet the informant

you be to wear this mask at the venice
carnival and wait to be contact

i understand

there be one last thing
elliot
Harmsway be vital to the economic
interest of this nation
he be also
a major contributor to the party
i
expect he to be given every consideration

political consideration

to the good of i recollection mr
bond i suggested no such thing
in fact i be never here

would you send in the new man from
equipment branch



right away

i hate to ask but
do you
ever think you would miss communism

we serve the interest of the british
people
no matter who we may be
foolish enough to elect

but if elliot Harmsway be involved
with that uranium i want he
prosecute to the end of the earth

hopefully it will not get that far

summit in tokyo
he be expect a
full update within the hour
for those of you still unaware some
forty minute ago

excuse i but
all turn to he

i must formally protest this meet
given the nature of what be occur
and the need for secrecy i see no
reason to involve the air force the
army or
this be an internal affair that should
be handle strictly by the officer of
she Majestys royal navy

admiral be you suggest

sorry i be late

actually you be just in time
admiral roebuck
you know commander
bond do not you

i have look forward to meeting you

as i be saying
approximately forty
five minute ago we received an abandon
ship signal from the


indomitable
look at these infrared satellite
image provide by mr
tanner of
the ship be presume lost here
just south of kuala lumpur where she
broadcast she last position


diver approaching the hull



to the right towards the stern

it be titanium
we can not cut through

i will do it

diver stand aside

gentleman
i do believe we have strike
gold
four minute ahead of schedule

Onethird of the british gold reserve
what kind of idiot lose
what be it
the equivalent of ten
billion dollar

give or take
depend on today
currency rate

what the hell be the gold do on
that boat

we be bringing it back from hong
kong
under order from the treasury

during the cold war we stored a
third in america and another third
in hong kong in case of a nuclear
attack
and with the turnover of
hong kong to the chinese

why be not the ship protected
why be it sailing without radar

i resent you tone sir
i have man
who be missing

and i have the entire british economy
to worry about

minister
obviously be not involved in
this operation
but i have to defend
the admiral

electronic silence be the safe way
to move that gold
otherwise any
country or individual with the
crude missile could just lock onto
we signal and take out the boat
that be what happen to the sheffield
in the falklands
since then it be standard operate
procedure for any sensitive shipment

at least we know where the gold be
when be the recovery ship due

hour
they have already sail
from the persian gulf

i expect to have that gold recovered
in hour
until then i be
imposing i own electronic silence
for the sake of the economy not a
word to the press the
beat looking at

and so long as commander bond here
seem to be such an expert on these
matter i want he to go along as an
observer
be we agreed

yes

yes

as you wish

remember the golden rule mr
stamper
he who have the gold rule

be the helicopter ready

fuel and waiting

good
we have an appointment in hong kong

you be turning into quite the
politician

i have an excellent teacher
make sure you wear the uniform

what do you make of all this

it do not quite add up

the infrared satellite image
no
heat no flame no explosion
if
that boat go down where they said
it do there should have be some
residual heat reading on the surface

sabotage

threethousand ton frigate do not
just vanish into thin air

i have already contact we station in
kuala lumpur
they be lining up a
local contact
i want you to find that gold and
secure it

do not elliot Harmsway just move
he headquarters to kuala lumpur

contrary to what you may believe
the world be not filled with
madman who can hollow out volcanoe
stock they with bigbreasted woman
and threaten the world with nuclear
annihilation

the case be closed
the italian
authority rule the girl a suicide
we have enough trouble keeping you
name out of the media
for
everyone sake
you job be to find the gold
not
settle some personal score with
elliot Harmsway

and that be the fifth document
with
you countersignature the sale will
be complete

be you sure
if we wait

general li
i young associate here
have just informed i that if i wait
a year i could perhaps receive a
high price for this build
he have great faith in hong kong
as do
i ancestor
with obvious result

yet to sell this build for more
money to profiteer would run counter
to the chinese sprit of guanchi mutual
trust and obligation
it would violate
the ancient principle of feng shui
the reason we sign five document
instead of an unlucky four and why this
build have a fifth nonfunctioning
ventilation shaft on it roof
wind and water fire and rain earth
and sky feng shui
all thing at
one in balance with nature

most eloquently put sir elliot

thank you general li
now i will just
sign this last document

terribly sorry
mr
stamper

sir elliot
red ink

of course
how foolish
more bad
luck
i will just borrow yours

an old chinese toast to we friend

confusion to the enemy
in hour
that build and all of hong kong
around it will cease to exist

since the
chinese takeover who know what can
happen tomorrow
in any case this be i father charles

royal bastard who start the first radio
and television station

amount to anything but
i turned it into this

welcome to the new world order mr

news sport business entertainment
and these be i foot soldier
people working on floor to feed
newspaper cable news network
magazine and different cable
channel in language

and still not a thing to watch

although it must be fun to have
all those satellite

they be merely tool to disseminate
information

or disinformation
if you wanted to
say beam down a signal to send a ship
off course
maybe one degree a minute

fantastic idea mr
bond
perhaps i
should buy it for a book
it be
totally preposterous but
you amuse i

and now perhaps i
can amuse you

let we see
first we have this
james bond
i believe he be a field
adjuster for lloyds of london

then we have this james bond

license to kill
not a bad title for that book
or perhaps you would prefer this james bond

who i believe they call


you see mr
bond you and i be both
man of action
but you era be pass
word be the new weapon
satellite the
new artillery
and make no mistake about
it
in the right hand they can be as
deadly as you walther

word to live by

a british cutter firing on she
billions
of dollar in bullion lying on the
bottom of the strait

obviously the british government
deny all of this

i told you

without proof there be just no story
do not you agree mr
bond

but i have proof
you run out of here
so fast i do not get to show you

and what be that i dear

sidney perhaps we should leave this to

he bring that up from the wreck

i see

sidney i would not

and what about this
any idea what this be

i believe it be a deplete uranium
drill bite i dear

far investigation

say i will not kill this story
miss oxford will show both of you to
the elevator

the stairs
attention all unit
they be on the
st floor

stamper

where be they

i do not see they
there

warn he

one second

how do you get into marine
salvage

i father left i the business

i used to be a divorce lawyer in new
york city

not a lot of difference

what do you mean

either way you be taking the goods
from dead hulk

let we go

damn

what the hell do that do

clean dirt
let we go

it be a trick
after he
they be in the south stairwell

get more man up there

down

up

down

up

and so much for that
they be on the nd floor setback
nowhere to go

now what

that should buy we some time

help i move this

i will call for a batter ram

no
get the fire ax

we will go down close to the sky bridge
we may be able to swing over and use it
for cover

no way
i sail
i do not fly

sometimes you just have to take
the plunge

all i know be one thing
if we get
out of here alive that gold be mine
i have earned it

one thing at a time

what now
and do not give i some
movie cliche like trust i


trust i

let we go

we be going to bounce off that thing

hold on

they be on the bridge
seal off the
th floor

i should have hired this man
get somebody up there

what about the elevator

we tried that already
remember

you know this be as much you fault
as it be mine

sidney we do not have time for this

sure
just when i want to talk
not that i would have believe you

put you back to the railing
sit up
on it

be you listening to i

put you arm around i neck
lock
you leg around i waist

we have time for that

sometimes you just have to

do not say it

be this like a normal day for you

it be a lousy job but
the only reason i stay be for the
health benefit

they be heading for the press room
stop they

he be bad news

down there



vert very good mr
bond
outstanding
performance

i be the certain the british taxpayer
would be impress by you effort
do not you agree

i think they would rather know who steal
they gold

why i do of course
it be on the
sea dolphin twenty mile outside
of hong kong
not that it will do
either of you any good to know
now both of you
stand up
and toss
the gun out mr
bond

uncle elliot
how could you do this
to i

oh please sidney
there be a
hundred billion dollar at stake
besides i never really liked you
father that much
he cheated at card

be you guard really going to kill
a helpless girl

i guard be from south africa mr
bond
this be they chance to get even
with the formerly great britain
now both of you
put you hand on
you head and step forward

what do you do Harmsway
make some
deal with the chinese government for
the gold
be the radioactive
uranium i find in venice part of it

question question mr
bond
which i be afraid i have neither the
time nor the inclination to answer
take they out to the jungle and

i forget to mention
the job come
with a car

kill it
shoot the damn thing

here
you shoot
i will drive

you know that be another reason
you be probably not in a successful
relationship

another reason
do i miss something

you insist on calling all the shot
and by the way
i be not a helpless girl

aim that way

ready
now

seal the garage
cut the power
he be get no headlamp

we be not going to make it

if it be radio controlled it will break
the code

if not

we blast through

build to withstand a nuclear blast
to stamper checking
bond pulse
be they alive

yes
shall we kill they

no
i have a good idea
in fact
mr
bond may have actually improved
i original plan
bring they both to hong kong
and
make sure he have nothing else up he
sleeve

as part of we continue report on
terrorism we be outside hong kongs
aberdeen harbor nuclear power plant

interview mr
david chin senior
engineer in charge of security
tell i mr
chin
how safe be this
plant from a terrorist attack

totally secure
without code you would
need a missile to blast through the
front door
you normally can not even get
this close without a full
security clearance

could you say that a little close
to the microphone

of course
you would need

now

let we go

get the machine in the water

what happen out there

generator blow
nothing to worry about
but i need one last shot of you
why
do not you stand by the alarm

no problem

up the stairs

put on you clothes
cuff he

i be sorry to interrupt again
but we
need one more picture for the story

why do not you line up against the
wall
let we make it a group shot

sleep well

next time i do the drive

the drill be in the water
approaching the intake tunnel

excellent

i see you be in you natural element
Harmsway
room filled with lethal
power
with a toxic core at it center

do come in mr
bond sidney
you be just in time for a nuclear
meltdown

you bastard

please sidney
i would like to remember
you fondly

approach the first gate

start the grinder

so that be what the weapon grade
uranium be for

precisely mr
bond
in a matter of
minute the bore device will
arrive at the core of the reactor
and when the radioactive blade cut
into the plutonium

instant meltdown

chernobyl will look like a campfire

we be through the first gate
approach the second

why Harmsway
be not stealing the
gold enough

bore through
they used to say live well be
the good revenge mr
bond
they be wrong
revenge be the good revenge

enter the main tunnel ten
minute to target

what could you possibly have to be
vengeful for Harmsway
still trying
to prove yourself to daddy

hong kong mr
bond

you have to leave

hundred and fifty year ago i
ancestor take this island a
barren lifeless rock and turned it
into the great city known to
modern civilization
and now that i be be forced to give
it back i intend to return it in
exactly the same condition

barren lifeless rock
the gold be merely reparation
payment from the spineless british
government who would not listen

i think uncle elliot be have
he own meltdown

approach the third gate

smash through it
