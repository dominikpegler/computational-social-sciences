he leave hand


damn

i suppose we could cancel the
fight indefinitely if you be
set on fighting green

it be not just green what
about the time apollos
invested

i believe we can find a
solution

solution nothing what
about the bicentennial fight

Jergens do not play game with
i client
apollo have already
do nearly a million dollar
worth of publicity

ten million worth

and have make contractual
obligation with over twenty
different organization he
do not want to be embarrass

you best find i another
rank contender an i mean in
a flash man

holding up
some note
i contact ernie roman
manager he be fighting in
france the same week

then give i buddy shaw he be
ranked fifth


shaw fighting in south
america why not postpone
the bout until july fourth

hell with fourth of july man
ten thousand thing be
going down on the fourth of
july
apollo want to be
first

that may not be possible jimmy

this man here be the star
dig do not because he to
breathe heavy now what
about that sucker billy dukes

go to california and gain
fifty pound and i called
every worthwhile contender
but they say five week be not
enough time to get in shape

shape nothing they be
afraid
they know everybody
in the world going to see this
fight an none of they get to
prayer of beating i so
they be makin excuse so they
do not have to be the chump
that be going to be whip in
front of the whole civilized
world

apollo i be sure there be a way
to salvage this

nobody want to be dissect
on the country birthday


all i can counter with be that
i be a goddamn good promoter
i have promote in every country
in the world and i have tried
to the good of i ability
perhaps you be right and no
one want to be beat on the
country birthday
i do not
know what else to say

i do maybe what this fight
need be something new a
novelty

yous the novelty champ

give i main man a raise

some people think bein shy be
a disease but it do not bother
i

it do not bother i either

racket where you almost
guaranteed to end up a bum
