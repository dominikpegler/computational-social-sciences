past mean the summer of when darwin be
the
child be
willy annie etty george
betty franky and baby lenny





in darkness chemical wash over a copper plate
strange
silvery pattern evolve in the halflight



we rotate downwards onto an irregular shape
this shape be greygreen and cram with detail which
emerge as we draw close like a continent see from outer
space
fruit fly land on it and we now recognise the shape as a
patch of lichen
number of other fruit fly be grazing there
wide
the lichen be on a rock
black lizard climb over
the horizon stalking fly
slow advance
sudden rush
fly be snap up and
mash between toothless gum
the lizard be fix it beady gaze on the next potential
victim when
shadow fall the lizard try to flee
seabird grab
the lizard in it claw
death be sudden and bloody
the bird settle to eat
whizz
thunk
sharpen stick fly out of nowhere and
impales the bird through it wing
the wound bird fall between boulder flap
helplessly
the rest of the flock take to they air calling and
wheel as
crowd of local savage come racing over the large
horizon of the rock armed with primitive bow and arrow
spear rock and throwingsticks
child grab the injure bird and kill it
an adult biff the child on the head and steal the bird
the rest of the savage leap among the jagged rock smite
each other shouting and snarling among the whirl flock
of bird





shot through a telescope
the whirl bird the
strange halfanimal form of the savage
the whole scene be jerky out of focus and inaudible at
this great distance like a very old silent movie



in terra del fuego
the land of
fire blight and loveless
country on the earth furthest
rim there life a community of
the dirty the rude the
least civilise being you can
imagine
the telescope focusses
the image become a little clear



the flock of booby fly out to sea
the savage follow as far as the top of the cliff where
they stop in sudden amazement stare at a distant sail
ship



they be all completely naked
the man as well as the woman
with hair down to they bottom
they speak in grunt and they
never washed they hand and
face
in many respect they
resemble wild animal except
that animal be kind to they
child
savage child make a comment and get biffed on the head
again
strange foreign cry of the sailor be faintly audible
over the water as the anchor be drop with a rattle and
a splash
small boat be lowered

one day captain fitzroy go
ashore to meet they
the slow rhythm of the oar
sailor and savage clutch they weapon watch each
other in breathless anticipation






door open and a figure in black hurry past clutch
a number of prepare photographic plate in they light
proof case

not long now
i shall be with you
immediately
wearing in a checkered dress aged about
year old sit looking straight at camera
she have short hair and a pretty oval face
on she lap there be a posy of artificial flower in the
background an improbable vista of jagged mountain



ready now
very still please

will this hurt papa

no
it be only a beam of light

how can light make a picture

well they prepare a copper plate
with chemical on it
the
chemical be sort of energized
by the light reflect off you
face
then silver stick onto the plate
accord to where the light be
brightest

betty be worry it would hurt
what a little duck she be

so as i be saying captain
fitzroy go ashore to interview
the Fuegans




wave lap on the black pebbly beach where a young naval
captain with mutton chop sideboard disembarks
lightly from he jollyboat




after some discussion persuade
three of the savage child to
come home with he
the discussion be more in the nature of heated bargain
for slave
fitzroy finally produce enough cloth and axehead to
secure the deal
the unwilling child push away by they parent and
grab by sailor who bundle they biting crying and
kicking into the waiting boat



they name be jemmy button
york minster and Fuegia basket




below deck
a slapstick struggle with soap and scrub
brush much biting kicking and howling as sailor
scrub the child clean

ow
shite
hold still you maggot

the captain have they washed and
get they hair cut then dressed
they in proper clothes and
taught they proper table manner



the child cleaned and dressed seem happy enough in
they new situation
they sit at the captain table clumsily saw with a
knife and chasing brussel sprout around a plate with they
cutlery
sprout shoot off the table



splosh
weight canvas body bag be tip overboard
the rough unshaven seaman crew all remove they hat some
of they cry openly


york minster die of the smallpox
but the other two learned english
and go to meet the queen











two year later
captain fitzroy
and i take they back in the
company of a young parson hope
they would bring the other
savage to god and to teach the
other by example

and what do you think happen






correct
complete and total
failure








Yaah
Yahh

sparkling with pollen







on the beagle quite often we
would drop a flask in the ocean
and find it teem with live
particle which glow in the
night








so much beauty for so little
purpose

surely not without purpose
they
be helping to light the ship

be you familiar with the works
of thomas malthus mr innes

he married he first cousin
do not he

so do charles
so do i

oh i be not at all
suggest


he make the point that if every
trout say have a hundred
offspring and so on and so on
through the generation
then the
planet would be knee deep in
trout in just a few decade

of course most of the egg be
destroyed and eat so the
number remain stable
that be
the beauty of god plan
emma give darwin a so there look and hand innes a
sandwich

cheese and cucumber

thankyou
somewhere in the wood annie have find a treasure trove of
worm and slug

exceedingly wasteful plan these
myriad live created only to be
immediately extinguished

charles

other

it

happy
close up on a write worm
hooker be instructing george
how to put a worm on a hook

through he bottom and up though
he mouth perfect


to be do god will

please ignore he
after two
glass of claret he tend to
become mischievous

no i be serious
if thousands be
destroyed that a few may live
they live be not the general
sum total of happiness not in
some kind of massive deficit

well far be it from i to
speculate on the mind of god far
less the happiness of an
earthworm ha ha ha
but it seem
to i that nature be at
peace
and most of she denizen
be content

amen

you do not agree

i think it be a battlefield

constant and shift struggle
for survival between everything
and everything else

i really do think man have a
problem with natural beauty
they
cannot ever just accept it for
what it be

we be reforming the linnean
the
committee will comprise myself
lyell huxley
yourself of
course if you be will

darwin grunt noncommittally
the crunch crunch of they
foot be punctuate by the regular stomp of he metalshod
walking stick

we intend to reclaim science as a
profession wrest it away from
the country parson and beetle
collector
you book will be we
rally point

you know it be not yet any fit
state to publish

i have read you detail
abstract
the argument be
complete and utterly compel
all that be lacking be the detail
and we know you have that in
abundance
you barnacle work have
establish you as the pre
eminent authority on marine life

on one small mollusc

in which the whole story of
creation can be read
do not
pretend to i that be not you
intention

honestly

family tree of barnacle
stretching back million year
to the time it be a free
swim prawn

there be many gap

of course with gap
but that be
the very point
if we but have the
complete fossil record we could
trace all life back to one speck
of protoplasm
the branch of
form in ever more complex
succession
until

yes yes but one cannot infer too
much


mr darwin
either you be be
disingenuous or you do not fully
understand you own
accomplishment
you have killed
god

mr huxley

and good riddance to the
bearded malicious old bugger

please i must beg of you

what do we know to be
true
will you light the way or
leave we all to flounder in the
mire for another decade
he stop and lower himself onto a bench tooth clench

be you alright

touch of indigestion
it will
pass
it clearly bad than that but huxley refuse to be
distract blithely ignore it and sit down beside he
til the bad of it pass

it be time to write you book mr
darwin
write it brilliantly as
we all know you can
strike hard
and fast with a blow that be
utterly conclusive

sir you be talking like a
revolutionary and really

and not
before time


goodbye to the lot of em damned
bishop and archbishop with
they threat of eternal
punishment

and you would replace god law with
what

the law of logic
the law of
nature

knowing as we do that most
capital crime be she everyday
practise
theft rape murder
adultery infanticide

we live in a society bound
together by the church

sight
in a little sundappled clearing a weasel be turning loop
the loop in a strange spiral dance for the benefit
of
a young rabbit which sit utterly hypnotized by the
performance
at first it strange and amuse then the dance become
more sinister
the weasel advancing by tiny increment as
it tumble in the air finally


the weasel seize the bunny rabbit by the back of the neck

darwin sit in sunshine at the rear of the house rugged up
against the cold
look frail still but oddly at peace

darwin look up blinking in the sunlight to see the stocky
darksuited figure of mr innes


may i join you

by odd means
he make some space on the bench
innes hesitate unable
to read Darwins feeling towards he
the smile be
welcoming enough but there be something not altogether
balanced about it

mrs darwin informed i you would
be alone and
perhaps a need
to counsel
he see an envelope on the ground and stoop to retrieve
it

you drop this
what a

accept there be nothing more we
could do

i know that
i know
long awkward silence neither of they want to
recapitulate the event of Annies death

you say you be writing about
she

no
it be a scientific text
but
i have reach a point beyond
which it be impossible to
progress
she have be i
companion throughout
now it
seem she be ahead of i in a
place i could not follow


of course
plainly she be in
heaven

that be what i wife believe
it
be a great consolation to she

but not to you

emma and i have become
divided
on it

do it affect you marital
relation

we have none
to speak of

be you familiar with the
writing of DeQuincy
there be no
such thing known to the mind as
forget


i do not know what it mean

he suggest we have thought
which do not actually enter the
realm of consciousness
nervous
fibre exist after all throughout
the whole body
be it not
possible that certain primal
feeling manifest in some
physical way
eczema
boil

fever
might some blocked passion
imitate a gallstone
or even
manufacture one

well until someone devise a
machine to read nervous impulse
or a telescope to look inside
the body i suppose we can only
guess at it

we can mr darwin
we can look
inside you
if you find yourself
open to it there be a way of
seeing




darwin wander the cobble street of malvern pause
occasionally to consult a handwritten address
it be starting to rain as finally he arrive at the
address he be looking for
substantial terraced house
darwin descend a stone staircase to the impose front

it could not run around and do any
damage



darwin work at he desk
there be a plaintive coo sound
coming from the box next to he foot

lid and feed it just because he
could not bear to let it die
finally he open the lid and offer the creature a biscuit
it have grow a bit large and make itself a nest
it take
the biscuit and peep gratefully
