










whoa whoa whoa
what be that

we begin again
let we kick in that new
transducer
see if we can double the
power output

whoa doc
wait a minute

okey
dokey

hiya peter

ardent but
uncomfortable
hiya liz
how be you do

Howm i do what

peter
peter
wait up

would you uh
excuse we for a minute

what be it
what

do the astrophysics journal really
accept you paper

yeah
well
all i gotos the data but
they have agreed to publish it when it be
finished
you know
it be i
calculation on the planetary conjunction

and it influence on the antiforce
be not it

yes
look harry i be busy with
indicate liz stand
there

yeah you and the rest of the class
every one be busy with liz

peter

hiya cupcakes

elbow he
affectionately
flash

and flash be the busy of they all

come on harry
we will be late for
octavius

ock be nut do not you agree

ock be a genius harry
crazy yes
but
a genius misunderstood and unappreciated

doctor octavius
you be late for you
lecture
the student be waiting
doctor octavius

you friend be impossible professor
Rosomorf i told the board we should let
he go

what be he do in there not he crazy
experiment again

you mean he antiforce theory
one day
they will give he the nobel prize for it

meanwhile he be demolish we
university
octavius
open the door

the antiforce experiment have now reach
the limit of electronic overload safety
therefore weiner you will disconnect
the overload safety device

whoa doc
someone at the door

world class scientific mind and they
stick i in the basement with this third
rate cyclotron

okey
Dokey

what be it peter

it be nothing

yes gentleman can i help you

tell you boss that he class be waiting

you well tell he yourself

professor octavius

gentleman come you must see this

but you student

the imbecile can wait
i have well
thing to do than teach introductory
physics Rosomorf
Undergrads be
kindless adolescence

you see he be impossible

thorkel you be the dummiest
administrator we university have ever have
do not go thorkel
come
look

the university pay you to teach
something to you student

well do you mean nothing
or do you
mean something but you will not tell i what
it be

i mean plain nothing

well i guess that be about as nothing as
you can get
plain nothing
beat

liz

ahh it be something

no
look

i be going for percent power


do not do that

ock
it dangerous

ock i warn you

keep calm everybody keep calm
use the
front door
everybody out the front

liz
come on

i can not
help i

i be coming

peter

get back you idiot
you can not go in
there

help
help i

thanks for you help flash

no problem wimp

we hero have a real way with word

oh why do not you grow up

this man will bring a disaster upon this
university

the universe be make up of force
and
counterforces
science be the study of
the force

continue without a
hitch
but i
professor otto octavius
have
devote i life to the study of the
counterforces
good job peter

taking place at lab
table
thanks professor

i do not believe it i simply do not

can we carry on mr
thorkel

i do not believe
oh all right carry on
professor

well
this week i dear student i have
make a stun breakthrough

wait a minute wait a minute
you have
get fire form to fill out dr
octavius

i have no time for form or
administrator who persist in
interrupt i mr
thorkel

i now believe it possible that these
counter force can be
collected
the
way the magnifying glass collect the
sunlight
and focused into a hard beam
i call
weiner

i call it the AntiForce

this antiforce once harnessed be
capable of undoing any natural force at
which it be aim
for instance
gravity

i be sorry

it be alright

we patch in the cyclotron
the light flicker and go dim

pay no attention to the light
i of
course steal it energy and it loose
power
we patch in the cyclotron
and
we gradually apply power
the power that
i be stealing

and so we stand four square against the
fundamental force that order and
maintain we universe
gravity
which be holding down this goddamn ball
rise

what a crock

shut up harry
this be very interesting

mr
parker
have you some
interesting
observation you would like to share with the
class

no sir

then shut up
and pay some attention to
the experiment

rise
rise

now that be what i call an experiment

you be looking at a representation of
two universe
we blue one
we real
universe
something we can touch and
feel and see and draw calculation about
this be we
the yellow universe
this
be something else
some other dimension
something
on the other side


if it be possible to generate enough
power behind it the antiforce could
wipe out not just gravity
but all we
universal force at the same time
in
effect
it would blast a hole between
this universe and the next
each
would flow into each other
no blue
universe
no yellow
end finished
over

that sound like a scenario for the end
of the world

i girl it be
it be
it would mean
wipe out everything that be known
and
letting in everything that be unknown

be not that a little dangerous

do not worry yourself true inter
dimensional penetration be still purely
theoretical but one day
maybe very
near
maybe in the st century

look it be just
i do not know
when
you and flash go after each other like
that

he be not i type

he do not have to be

check

and besides he be not all bad

you do not get nickname flash because
you be a rocket scientist liz

give it up parker
you would die for a
nickname like flash

yeah of embarrassment

hey flash
i be scalp a pair of the
midnight madness wrestling match tomorrow
night

the Slammies
i would kill for that

would you pay

well uh i
gee
if
can i tell
you tomorrow

you snooze you lose
hiya liz

kim you know peter and harry
this be
i new roommate
kim nickson

hellooo peter

hi

we be going to the student reunion
meet
you coming

i can not
i get to go over to the daily
bugle
i be trying to sell some photo

Soooh a photographer

just an amateur
well
nice meet
you kim

yeah
i bet it would be

can i be you date for the reunion
ShooShoo

no jerk

what do i say

it be not what you said it be how you say
it ShooShoo

damn

peter doc ock want to see you

about i data i bet

i do not know

he know about i work on the planetary
conjunction do not he

i do not know

hello professor octavius
i really admire you experiment

we have a lot of interest in common
peter
perhaps we should put we head
together if you know what i mean

that would be
great

now you take the planetary conjunction
this saturday night we will witness
saturn jupiter the moon the earth the
sun
all in a row
never see within
the memory of man or measured for it
effect
the total gravitational force
must be quite exceptional
be not that
the subject of you paper

yes sir i have work out a new way to
calculate the combine gravitational
effect

i be a busy man mr
parker
but i think
i could find the time to go over it with
you
make sure it all
check out

well
i be sort of working with
professor Rosomorf and he suggested we
kind of keep it between we
he think
that i theory be
well i do not know

the scoundrel
i want to see that data peter

but professor octavius
if i know you
be interest
sorry i have already
given it to
professor Rosomorf and he
be after all the head of we physics
department
and i could not

well i be certain something can be work
out
run along young man

just a minute
how about if i show you
i discovery
something i never
show to any other student
as a
matter of fact to anybody at all

well i be really flattered i mean i would
love to
but i

very well shall we say if you come here
tonight

but professor i do not now if i should

make it eight sharp
i will be waiting
for you
right here

the same academic world that be so keen to
embrace that boyo undergraduate work
ridicule i antiforce theory as
quackery
i ask you weiner
what be
we society coming to
ha

they be all a bunch of brainless
asshole that be what i say

weiner
go get i that boyo data

cost you fifty buck

just get it
we will negotiate you fee
when you have the data alright weiner



garbage
absolute garbage

bag lady
i hate bag lady

yes sir

little kid
i hate little kid
this
be a daily newspaper
we need news value
photograph not artsyfartsy shit

yes sir

kid
you want a proas assessment

yes sir

you photo suck
parker i reader be moron
i get to
grab they by the eye
every time you
press the button of that nikon of yours
it cost you fiftyfive cent
so the
next time you be about to take the plunge
ask yourself be i taking dog bite man
because if you be

i know i know
you want man bite dog

parker this be the post modern th
century
i want man eat dog
get out

rent
rent more bill rent

anyway i have decided to kidnap you for
dinner in forest hill

it be friday night

yes
do you have a date

no

then come on

professor Rosomorf what happen here

someone tried to rob i of some paper
i suspect they be looking for that one

what be it

award win stuff
peter parkers data on the planetary
conjunction
damn lucky i hide it in i
computer under another title

i god what be going on in we school
first professor octavius almost blow up
the physics lab
now this
you report
it in triplicate of course

thorkel be careful when you talk to
octavius
remember
the man be a very
fragile genius
one day he will bring we
all the noble prize

Rosomorf the man be a very dangerous
crackpot

that be he again
he be working day and
night

i tell you the man be very dangerous
come on Rosomorf let we stop he before
this build will explode

shut it down octavius

you have blown half the circuit in the
science center

call an electrician

i have called the locksmith

what
what be he do

we have to shut you lab down and take a
look at the line

please otto we must lock it up

you be deny i access to i cyclotron

you bet

okey dokey
just give i till tomorrow
i want to clean up i paper
tomorrow
ha
tomorrow you can have this room

oh
well thorkel

no i be alright
i scholarship cover
almost everything and i sell some photo
here and there
today i physics
professor ask for some of i work
he
want to study i data
they might
publish i work in the science magazine
that bring i some money

publish you work
you hear that may

yeah in fact i have to leave a little
early tonight to meet professor
octavius
he offered i to be he
assistant

i
i can not aunt may
professor
octavius want to discuss i new
finding

peter what you should be finding
be a
nice girlfriend

i will show they
closing the cyclotron
on i
weiner

yes professor

where be he
it be ten past eight of the clock

that must be he
he open the door

good evening

you be late

okey dokey parker
how would you like
to take Weiners place
i mean be i
assistant

well professor that would be a great
honor but i be already working with

Rosomorf
that imbecile
do not you
understand kid that i be about to
uncover the great discovery since
einstein come up with he theory of
relativity
the AntiForce


wow
the theory of the Antiforce
you
should go for the noble prize professor

noble Shmoble i be going for a much
big prize kid
okey dokey
let i
show you kid what i get here

present maximum antiforce power to date
be percent of theoretical limit
i
have patched in the variable
particlewave accelerator
i will now try to reach power
and if you paper have any value
i can
use it to get the power i be missing to
create the antiforce to break through
and beat any other form of power in we
or any other universe capish

sorry professor i can not do it
i give
i word to professor Rosomorf

percent
antiforce
percent
that be all i be missing
parker we can
be rich together

sorry
i would well go now

you will be sorry parker

you
get out of there you creeping

what happen to you
what
do you do

oh i god
what happen here

now please go home
everybody
we must clear the ground

you think they will cancel class

they must
the whole build must be
contaminate with some kind of poisonous
gas

how about nuclear contaminations

i god
let we beat it
but nobody move

more interest in other
thing
could anyone be in there peter

i do not know
maybe professor octavius
he usually work late

you have a visitor doctor

octavius i be afraid i have bad news for
you

the cyclotron be damaged

what used to be the cyclotron be
permanently shut down this afternoon

but i work

you work be a disaster
look at
yourself

myself
i do not matter
nobody matter
anymore
to enter a new dimension we

what
would you say

oh i god what be those horrible
thing sticking from you body
