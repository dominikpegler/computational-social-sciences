heavy leaden sky over the arachnoid stand and floodlight
of elland road stadium
home to leeds united football club
and rain
sheet of angry yorkshire rain




flashlight pop as the most
successful manager in english football walk out in front of
a pack of newspaper and
he be flank by the
chairman of leeds united and several
other whitehaired blazerwearing member of the board

i be just going to make a brief
statement

stand under a large trophy cabinet filled with the
silverware he have win
wait
intimidated
cowed

yesterday afternoon at
i
accepted the fas offer to become the
next manager of the england national
football team
gasp among the
burst of flashlight
the
look down at the floor in silence
bereaved
father losing they favourite son

obviously that involve i leaving
leeds united after happy and
successful year which make i very
sad
i would like to think i have build
the club into a family and there must
be sadness when anybody leaf a
family
however when one man go
another step into he place
i know
who i think that person should be the
man to replace i and i shall make i
feeling clear to the director
thank
you
no far comment
turn and walk out a volley of shouting
question




we be in a car
tarmac pass beneath we
Roadmarkings

the sound of a flat teeside voice singing along
with frank sinatra on the radio



fly i to the moon



two young stare out of car window
raindrop
on the pane of glass
they father
slick modern cocky handsome
about as big a contrast to
as it be possible to find be up front
drive

and let i play among the star


when be we there

any moment now
on the right
let i see what spring be like

the car turn a bend and suddenly the floodlight and stand
of a football stadium come into view
the eye widen

there it be
dad
there it be
the smile in excitement


on jupiter and mars

written on the side of the
stadium
smile then put he foot down
the car
accelerate past the turn
the smile fade

where be you going
dad
you have
missed it

we have something else to do first
will not take long




in other word hold i hand
in
other word darling kiss i

the continue as the car drive on turning into the
of a television program


the front title sequence a yorkshire current
affair program
we be in a studio
the presenter be


today we welcome brian clough as he
start he new job as manager of leeds
united taking over from don revie
the most successful manager in the
club history under whom leeds have
win everything

not everything
not win the
european cup

but pretty much everything else
daunt

daunt
not at all austin
look
forward to it

the big challenge of you life
and you will be without peter taylor
for the first time
you lifelong
professional colleague

yes Petes at brighton now
he have
the opportunity to come with i but
brighton be he choice
leeds be
mine

surprise choice some might say
because you have be very vocal in you
criticism of they over the year

i have




you have accused player of dirty
tactic cheating dissent foul play
you called norman hunter norman
bite you leg hunter you have say
peter lorimer fall when no one
touch he

and i be right

i be curious
why do you now show such
alacrity to joining they after such
vituperative criticism of they for so
long

goodness it be going to take i half
an hour to explain all those word for
a start

football be a beautiful game austin
it need to be play beautifully
i
think leeds have sell themselves
short



they have be champion but they have
not be good champion in the sense
of wearing the crown well
they have not
be loved
but then that be hardly
surprise given the type of
operation there be be in place there



football club be like family
footballer be sensitive people
i would
like to bring a little warmth into the
setup




that type of operation
i presume
you be refer to don revie

i be



who have long be regarded as a
father figure in leeds
and now you be
coming in as the outsider the enemy
even after all the thing you have say
in public coming in and taking ouver
as stepfather






do not you expect some degree of
resentment to this

i would accept and expect a
strangeness initially it be perfectly
normal
but it will not be long before
they realise i be a fair man
kind
man
and maybe under i they can
experience what it be like to be in a
happy family after all

how can you be sure they be not happy
with don all along

they would not have play football
that way if they be happy







where have you be boss

director have be waiting more than
an hour
mon

clough face in closeup
singing the national anthem
he see in the crowd
clough eye

habit of remind they just how far

arrogant twat

oh brian you should

turn bremner
inside out nutmeg madeley for good
measure

you would think

Aberbloodydeen

what make you go for the brandy

they be just nervous
shitting
themselves
you could tell

you be a bloody genius
i tell you
what bri if we can beat this lot
we can go all the way



derby win against ipswich town



derby win against sheffield united



derby beat huddersfield town


announce that derby county have win the first
division championship


the celebrate in a communal bath holding the
trophy drink champagne
spraying one another with water


and hold aloft a large trophy
travelling on board an opentop bus through derby
the whole
town have taken to the street


still celebrating and still surround by
and

derby county winning the championship
be a victory for decency for honesty
and for football
because they do not
pull shirt or nudge people in the
back in the box




they do not protest every decision
chop hack or bully unlike some
team i could mention beginning with
the letter

if you ask i the good thing for
british football the quick way to
clean it up would be fore dirty side
like leeds to be send down for a spell
in division two




i have not personally hear mr
clough comment but they have be
report to i and we solicitor be
looking into they
if i could offer
mr
clough some advice
i think he would
be good off keeping he opinion to
himself
some of these allegation
against leeds united and he fellow
professional be an absolute
disgrace
we be


don revie
ooooh
do not mention that name to i

it be really like the other house of
commons
you hate to mention he
why

i hate to mention he why
because
he be a very talented man and i do not
like he

he be a very very talented man and he
record be unsurpassable
but i just
happen not to like he
and i do not
like the way he go about football
either
football be a game of opinion
and there be perhaps people in you
profession who do not like the way you
do you bit

sure
aa



and er
it make the game go round
half the country do not like a labour
government
it just happen that the
other half do

why do not you want i to ask why you
do not like he

because i can not tell you
it be
impossible
we would get closed down
david

brian you have be called bigheaded
arrogant brash the lot

by you profession john yeah

sure
and a whole of it right too

and a whole lot of it wrong

fine
i will concede that
so how would
you define you approach to
management apart from be
brilliant

good lad
thank you for the
compliment
it be very very difficult
when you get ask a question like
that

you have achieve something here that
most manager struggle for year to
achieve this
it be come to you very
young
be you surprise
ab






suprise david
but more than
surprise delight
it be nice be not
it
for the good guy to win for once

which for you be the most important
match to win and the good performance
from you point of view

beating leeds united obviously
always a particular pleasure that

brian you have also do it on
comparatively small gate which i
know have niggle you a little bit
during the season

niggle i david it be absolutely
make i blaze
to be honest i know
what i want to achieve i know what
the people of derby want we to
achieve but when you have get a
chairman not wanting to put he hand
in he pocket

you ever see eighty five or perhaps
ninety percent of chairman talking
i would love a few chairman on you
programme occasionally i believe the
very sight of they bring the game
into disrepute some clap in the
audience
and every time they open
they mouth it kill it
because the
very thing they have given i a lot of
stick about over the year about
talking too much and going on
television too much there be the
very people who can put two word
together and it rather embarrass
to i that a man or man can stop
i talking to people like you
i love
football
it be deep it go right
down through
it be in every nerve
vein you name it
it consume i
and
when i have to come and talk about i
like the passion of football to come
out
because there be not enough in
the game





i like a bit of the honesty i like a
bit of the truth
i accept without any
shadow of a doubt that i talk too
much apart from on this show

how do you react when someone say
boss you be do it wrong


i say how do you think it should be
do
we talk about it for twenty
minute then we decide i be right

the world know who i be
the world
know i talk a lot




but there be some fellow in london
england named
brian clough
anyway i hear all the way in america
they say he be another mohammed ali
well there be just mohammed ali
i
want you to know
clough
you be not taking i job
i be the talker
now clough
enough



be you going to stop it

no i want to fight he







william bremner you conduct in the
charity shield match be deplorable
and cannot be tolerate

it be

we understand leeds be taking
disciplinary action against you
internally however the football
association have to be see to make an
example
we have therefore decided to
impose a fine of five hundred pound

good evening
tonight the football
world be stun by the news that
brian clough have be sack as
manager of leeds united
we will be
talking not just to brian clough but
also to the man he replace who be
success he could not emulate don
revie
turn to

to brian clough first of all
what be
you reaction to be sack in this
fashion

obviously austin i initial reaction
be one of shock at finding myself here
with revie

see
not so easy to make accusation
when it be to someone face

but in answer to you question six
week be hardly a long time to be
given a chance in any job
i would
hope revie would get a lot long time
in he




do you consider it be possible to
step into you shoe don revie
to
replace you

be very very honest i think it
be a difficult job for anyone to do
but i do feel brian clough i will not
call he clough because i will not take
he down like that

thank you




i do feel he make it hard for
himself than he need have

how do i do that don

shoot he mouth off about how dirty
i player be

well you dirty don

that be not true
the last four
season we have top the chart for
entertain football

and before that you also top
the disciplinary chart
you should
have be docked point and send
to the second division

and in fact you go on record and
said so brian clough
again and
again
that leeds should in fact be
relegate

and i be right

do you think that might have hurt you
chance of success when you then come
to manage they

of course it do
the thing he said
why man
why do you take the job in
the first place

because i think it be the good job
