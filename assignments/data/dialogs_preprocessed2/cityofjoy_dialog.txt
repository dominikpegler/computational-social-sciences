fifteen year from now
miami
florida dr
Manooj pal in
association with dr
maxwell loeb

from the godfather son
for you
and the doctor

acha



you

i understand that you be interest
in expanding you clinic and free
school and that you intend to
start treat leper in the city
of joy

we would like to well serve the
entire community mr
ghatak


of course
that be very good
admirable
and we would be please to
rent you suitable space
but you
must understand that certain
payment will go up

i understand the rent would have
to go up if we rent large
quarter from you mr
ghatak but
why should we have to pay more
protection

more people more potential
trouble
stranger
if i do not
charge you what will i tell
other

but we can not afford it

surely if you can expand you can
pay more

be i stupid but be not this
protection money money we be
paying you to protect we from you

we live in chaotic time miss
bethel doctor
i control the
city of joy and maintain it as a
model of harmony
it be a miracle
but a very fragile miracle

and how be we threatening you
miracle

i admire you courage in choosing
to work in such a violent place
miss bethel


you neighbor in the city of joy
they be not educated they be
given to violence to meanness i
can promise you they will not like
have leper among they but
because they know you be under i
protection

doctor do you like we music

well i can not say i have developed a
craving for it yet

it be difficult to appreciate what
we do not understand be not it
let i put it another way
the
world be a terrible place
only
the ruthless prevail
i son will
make the arrangement with you

i like you taste in neckwear

the entire package we be propose
will cost you three thousand rupee
a month

if we pay you that we will not have
any money for supply


i be tell you be very resourceful

i think i see a solution
may i
what if we be to work out a
profitsharing arrangement
we
give you a share of we net profit

how do you expect to make a profit
off of leper and the poor doctor

beat the hell outta i asshole
but you have obviously find a way

have you go right off you
rocker
these people do not have
a sense of humor
be you trying
to get yourself killed

i do not think so
but with i
any duplicity be possible

stop it you
you
you nudnick


who give you you rickshaw

the godfather

who provide the food you eat

the godfather

remember
loyalty


the godfather be at least
civilized
the son be vicious
remember the last election the
molotov coctails the blow with
iron bar
they will throw we out
we will not be able to find anyone
else to rent to we
we will just
have to agree to pay what he
want

Saladdins right
neither nature
nor the people with the power
have any conscience
we have to
pay

what do you say doctor big
brother

i think we must try to break the
godfather hold on we

please hear i out
but i think
we have to be very cautious

how the hell do you proceed with
caution against these people
you can not
you have to risk
everything


you try to negotiate with these
people you make compromise with
they they will eat you alive
stand
up against they now and they will
fold
i guarantee it
underneath
they be coward they get no guts
we show they we be strong and
the just move on to easy
picking

we
you have an airplane ticket

you know max this be not
american gangster television

yes if you be wrong you do not
have to be here

i be not wrong
you bow you head
you plead with you god to do
what you will not do yourselves
you put up with this nightmare
as if there be no choice
i be
telling you if you do not stand
up to that little pimple face
now he will own you for the rest
of you live

even though i be invisible to some
of you and i do not have a complete
set of leg to stand on i stand
with the doctor big brother
maybe
nature do not have a conscience
or those with the power but do not
we


i agree with Anouar and max daddah
i think it be worth the chance

be it permitted to speak

i want i child to be educated
and care for
this be we home
we have never have such friend
but many of we owe a great debt
to the godfather
he be strong
and could kill we
but we must
choose
i trust i big brother
i say we must stand up

sister joan what do you think
really

well i think max have hit on the
heart of what we be trying to build
here
a selfhelp society
each
of we have to decide for himself
as for i i suppose i think
really that if the bastard be
going to suck we dry i would like to
get in a couple of good left
hander before i turn the other
cheek

but who will rent to we


i have a property i will rent you
for two hundred rupee a month
and not a rupee less
