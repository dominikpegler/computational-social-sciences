still behind kafka
at the door
you know he

yes

he name be eduard raban

yes

with an introductory
nod
inspector Grubach


kafka be that you real name

yes
yes of course why
would not it be

when be the last time you see
mr
raban

wednesday
we left the office
together

do you go anywhere afterwards
to have a drink perhaps

no we said goodbye outside the
build
he go off as usual
toward he house

you office be the workmens

accident and compensation
association

where you have be employed for
seven year

eight and seven month

engaged in the manufacture and
distribution of
pill and so
forth

well other department be yes

would you describe you relationship
with the dead man as close

yes
since he come to the office
almost three year ago we have
be quite good friend
how be eduard

he be find in the river
could
he swim

i do not know

be he depress

no
he do not seem to be
do
you think he drown himself

grow man do not normally fall
into the river do they

no i suppose not

he might have have a drink or two
despite what you think

as the interview
seem to be over
can i ask how you find i

he landlady know of no other
friend to refer we to

i do not think he really have any
he have no family either

we know that

he be not a lonely man though

what make you think so

just a perception


i do not usually involve myself
with you people in the old quarter
but the river run it own course
it will not be the last time it
deposit it unwanted debris on i
doorstep

probably not

anyway i would like you to reflect
that in i you have i will not say
a friend because we be complete
fencer of course from
distinctly incompatible social
class but to some extent shall
we say an interest third party

i will bear that in mind

should you happen upon anything
that might be relevant


you wanted to see i sir

sit down kafka

you have be with the firm for
nearly nine year
you have do
you work diligently there be no
complaint on that score
but
there be more to the job than the
work there be other people to
consider and frankly kafka we
eel you social situation could
bear improving

i
social situation

you keep too much to yourself
you be a lone wolf
it make i
uneasy and if it make i uneasy
i can not imagine the impression you
make on lesser employee

to do i work well i have little
time for

you must make the time
where
do you go off to in the lunch
hour

i usually take lunch by the river

it be not healthy kafka not for
you and not for you workmate
at
the annual dinner this month you
again failed to make an appearance

i do not realize it be obligatory

have you never wonder and i
mention this only in pass
as he pace past and
kafka turn he head
why other clerk have advanced to
more responsible position while you
who have be here longer have not

no sir

attitude kafka
it do not matter
how well you do you work you
still see it as something to be
get on with rather than something
to take an active interest in

lean forward in
rebuttal
well i

oh i know you get along with that
poor fellow what be he name

eduard

yes raban but he be too
much like you even more so
perhaps
he be not here as long as
you so i do not know he as well
but i could see the influence he be
have
i simply want you to be
aware of this because you will be
happy for it

in any case do not ask i why
the word have come down you be to
be promote

you colleague death have helped
precipitate the need though i can
tell you it be be under
consideration for some time
you be
to be given two assistant and a
commensurate rise in salary
sit back behind
desk
that be all

kafka

i understand you fancy yourself an
author

almost visibly
cringe
in a small way

you might find a more athletic
hobby put some color in you
cheek

good morning
or should i say good afternoon

say what you like no one pay
the least attention

walking quickly
alongside she
oh do not they
i think you
underestimate i station in this
office and overrate you own

not today Burgel
send one of
you memo write up one of you
communique but for god sake
do not bother i today

it be i place to offer advice not
yours and by advise the chief
clerk of you unpunctuality it be
certainly not i situation that be
compromise if that be what you be
imply

stop to glare at
he
you be just do you job

it be what i be paid to do

you be detestable

and you be late


i assistant i presume

yes that be we

i be kafka

ludwig

oskar

you look like brother

yes we do

have you work here long

no no no quite a long time
yes

well we would well move thing
from i old desk


eduard and i have lunch together
one day
and you see we

on the embankment


i be have an affair with
eduard
he do not tell you

no

he would have
you be he good
friend
good friend than i

i suspected that he well

what

that he be satisfy in that
regard
i do not want to pry

throw she hair
back proudly
it be not that we wanted to deceive
anyone but you know how these
thing be look upon at the office

what be funny

this morning it be suggested to
i that i own sense of office
fellowship could bear improving

as long as it be on they term
if you work and you private
life do not correspond to they
specification you be labelled a
dangerous agitator with no
recourse whatsoever

how long be you and eduard

two or three month that be all
i seduce he

you know as well as i do that he
do not commit suicide

no i do not
i be amaze that anyone
be able to bear life with any
assurance at all

eduard do not see it as something
that needed bearing

the police would know the
difference would not they

do you think people in the new
town care what happen over here
nodding across the
water
this will always be the ghetto

he be not robbed
he be
identified by he wallet

and you believe everything the
authority tell you

when i have no reason to doubt

the very fact that they be
authority should give you reason
people will do anything to protect
they own interest
for all you
know he be killed at the
hand
of
the police

what could he have do to
warrant that

be you free tonight

tonight

there be some people i would like you
to meet
can you come to the
musil district at eight of the clock

all right

you almost married recently
do not you

last year
i it be broken
off

eduard wanted to marry i

and you

i be suspicious of man who want
to marry
i believe they think
it be the only thing that will
make they equal to they father

then follow
behind she
i do not know the musil
district

you will not have any trouble find
it


long live anarchy


please sit down

we will save the introduction
we do not know yet if you be friend
or foe

stranger make good foe than
friend
will you tell i who you
be altogether if not individually

herald of a new age do that
sound immodest

you could say we represent the
un
official view of a wellordered
society

ah we be back to the authority
you speak of

they be ubiquitous
what we try to
do
be make they a little less so

quite a disturbance tonight yes
and perhaps you recall last month
the explosion at the municipal
courthouse that send one of the
examining magistrate to join the
heavenly choir

be eduard one of you

the last to join we the first to
leave we

why take i into you confidence

that be obvious be not it
we
have an open for a new member

i nominate you as a possible
candidate
you be Eduards good
friend
he read i some of you
work

i have hardly published enough for
anyone to draw conclusion from

you strike i as a man with a
define notion of injustice a
high concern for the lot of you
fellow man
and yet you be able to
remain an outsider
with the
concomitant air of
superiority

in short a high man
it be what
we want
it be what we need

the distance to i fellow man be
for i quite a journey
as for
be an outsider it be never be
a matter of choice

as kafka start to
leave
they may have institute proceeding
against you

what proceeding

preliminary investigation may already
be underway

you be he friend
one link be
all they need

the day he die eduard be called
up to the castle
do you know that

what of it

he be summon to help correct a
minor discrepancy of some sort in
the medical record division
apparently one of he claim be
relevant

merely in the interest of order
you understand
the official at
the castle like to cover they track

he be never see alive again

and you still maintain what
that he be murdered

he be murdered

as you can imagine a pass into
the castle hardly ever grant
be an opportunity we could not
ignore

the castle represent every
anachronism that need to be destroyed
if progress be to be make

as you know it be not the most
accessible location
far from be
depress eduard be particularly
excite when he bring we the news
of this chance invitation
he set off
that evening carrying one of we
custommade briefcase instead of
he own

you be shock at the thought of
eduard tossing a bomb through a
window

i have no right to be i know
i
experience with real life be
practically nil

when you only see someone sitting at
a desk all day it be liable to
create a false impression

people must think the same of i
a quiet dependable person

you do not have to accept everything
as true i friend
you need only
accept it as necessary

as the bomb never go off we can
only assume he be catch with it
and summarily executed

merely in the interest of order

the formality of a trial would be too
costly for they
they be beginning
to understand that it be the ensuing
news of we action that incite
support

propaganda of the dead

the castle will deny he be there
any long than he business required
they be just file clerk up there
no
doubt he be hand over to the police
with the utmost discretion

in any event we have feel no
repercussion as yet
eduard must not
have talk
you be the one they
contact

so that be who i foe be policeman
and file clerk
law and order you
might say

you think what we be do be so
wrong
and what be you do
pursue goodness
for what
to
answer to some supreme tribunal

i only concern be the human
tribunal
be not it yours

yes which be why quiet
dependable people have to take
charge of they own live

at the cost of other
you accuse
people of murder without trial
apparently without irony
do you
go to the castle with eduard
then you have no idea what really
might have happen that night at
all even before or after he get
there

you human tribunal will betray
you
just as it member will be
betrayed when they find no supreme
one

join we kafka

it be sheer folly for anyone to
try to pull through alone



how be you evening

fine terrible

uncover he
typewriter
what be the matter with it

he can not sit still
just when we
arrive at a nightclub he want to
go to another one

you look tire

gabriela rossman be here looking
for you
do you know she

do you

we see she naked once do not we

woman be all you have on you
mind

she go to the roof to sunbathe
one lunch hour we watch she
changing

i do not realize you would be here
that long

you mean because it be be a while
since there be a sunny day
what
a good detective you be

they keep switching we from
department to department
he
do not mind because he can not sit
still

we used to be in the supply section
carrying box of medicine about
but we drop too many of they

it be not too bad work here

you do not think it be a horrible
double life from which there be
probably no escape but insanity

no

i be glad for you

you should be content you know


be you looking for gabriela
rossmann

yes


hardly glance at
he
i be collecting Eduards thing
if there be anything you want take
it or i will give it to charity

taking she note
from he pocket
Burgel give i this what do
it mean

Burgel
i do not leave it with
he

why be you given notice

they be not oblige to tell

it could not be for that incident
with Burgel the other day

of course it could Burgels
be trying to get i throw out
as long as i can remember
he
could have killed eduard

you do not believe that

i would not put it past he

it seem i know eduard a little
bit after all

lodger
not one of they think
to spare i such spectacle

you might think i think so
myself at first that Burgels
too insignificant to be dangerous
but that be the very reason to beware
it be the small man to watch out for
the one who substitute method
for character

sigh at she
relentlessness
now you have fallen into he trap
when he go to bed at night
Burgel dream of inspiring as much
fear in other as they inspire in
he

it be still easy for you to
understand suicide be not it

that street down there i
always used to call it the approach
road for suicide
it lead
straight down to the bridge and
the river

Burgel hated eduard
and i
i be
sure he know about we and i be
sure it drive he mad

Burgel do not like anybody

he used to like i very much
more than i liked he

he be jealous yes but
that
jealous
he be too cautious

of course he be the castle
precinct be not the safe part
of the city after dark
people
disappear up there regularly
if
you want to lie in wait for someone
that be the place to do it

now you be saying eduard be lure
there

put away the last
few book
how often do one of we clerk
have business in the house of record

i have hear of it happening

and Burgel be the bringer of
message be not he

usually

or what if there really
be
an
error
i do not know what kind
any kind that needed correcting
and what if Burgel be responsible
for it
one mistake even a small
one in a firm like ours it could
cost he a promotion

first these nameless authority
be the root of all evil now it be
insignificant Burgel
if indeed
there be a mistake and a minor
one at that you be suggest
someone go to a lot of trouble
over something so trivial as to
not matter at all

what seem important to these
people be not determined by the
amount of work it entail you be
far from understanding the
authority if you believe that

now Burgels one of the authority

for all he big talk he be
do
he really have access to the director
of the firm as he always claim

or only the deputy manager people
of no importance whatsoever
someone
ought to follow
he
for a change

you will not make any sense of it
while you be upset

Burgel be only there for one
purpose to spy on the employee
and report any and all indiscretion
real or imagine
if he do not
send eduard to the castle you can
be damn sure he be in league with
whoever greet he there
all those bastard be in league
with each other why can not you
see that

i do not see anything
i see
a message on it way to i with
all the right answer
only it
never arrive it be always just
on it way

eduard

you ignorance of the way thing
be here be so appal that it
make i head spin to listen to
you and compare what you say and
have in mind with the real situation
do not
hear slam


you said she be extremely upset
people who be extremely upset
kafka be given to disappearing
in a hurry
they go and calm down
for a day or so and then they come
back

but that be just i point she be
more than upset she be livid
she slam every door on she way
downstairs except that one
i be just behind she and i do not
even hear that one
shut
not at
all

that be not what i call conclusive
evidence of an abduction

if someone be waiting here in the
hallway to spirit she away would not
they have shut the door as quietly
as possible


why would someone want to kidnap
this woman the name be rossmann

you told i to contact you if
anything relevant come up
gabriela be relevant
when i
speak to you before i do not know
she would be seeing eduard

that be be noted
but where
do it lead we
unless you have
something more to add

she be miss
i go to she house
and she have not return there

she lost she job today
just
between you and i i would probably
go away and brood a bit myself

maybe it be true then what she said

what do she say

that the police may have allegiance
to something other than truth

she do not think eduard
commit suicide
any more than i do
she be convince of it

i be going to say something and
i hope it be quite clear because
i will not be repeating it

we do not have to hunt for criminal
we be draw towards they
the
guilty show we the way


where be you friend

good question
who
be i friend
would also be of interest


stare into steaming
coffee cup
gabriela be right it be
easier for i to understand suicide
i be a practicing suicide

slightly mocking
as ever
in what sense

bachelorhood be just the slow
form
the bachelor do not sew
seed
only the moment matter
the space he occupy grow
small and small until the
only space right for he be his
coffin

these strange story you write
they come naturally do they

naturally
that be not the word
i would have chosen

where do you get you idea
only joking i be just joking
let we go to a brothel then
kafka come on

i have not get the energy
i
mean i have to conserve i energy

why do you work in that hideous
insurance office
dealing with
people who fall off ladder
now
take i i make i live as a
stone mason
it be not i art
but it be the
tool
of i art
you
could be a journalist

that would be even bad it would
be a compromise

success or nothing

no not even success
i write
be not for making a live it be
for live
not for other people
it be for i

i be the exile
gabriela be
right about that too


we have another theory

we may have attached too little
importance to the reason eduard
be summon to the castle to begin
with

to correct a small discrepancy
you may recall

ah but what if it
be not

small

what if it be a
large
discrepancy

yours be a very powerful and important
firm it have a lot at stake

perhaps eduard be close than he
know to discover it and so have to
be silence

or he be even more an innocent
victim than that he be
chosen
to
bear the blame if the crime be
uncovered by anyone else

the crime so scandalous that the
poor young clerk committed suicide
rather than own up to it

that be
mad

oh yes it be mad

you said so yourself the firm
be large and powerful
if the
discrepancy really be something
big Eduards responsibility would
still have to be small
no poor
young
clerk
could find himself in
such a fix

when a scapegoat be needed i
friend

we have to know what he be working
on at the time of he death

he worked on routine claim
he
visit to the castle be probably as
minor a mission as he said it be

why be you so aggressively
unimaginative
eduard be no longer
the only casualty

then why have not i be

kidnap or murdered
because
you
connection with eduard be
obvious
and above board not as
easily misconstrue

not secretive therefore not
suspicious

gabriela on the other hand have
make an enemy of this man Burgel

oh Burgel
gabriela be have an
affair with eduard
they be both
member of
this group
if any
crime be discover and people
be paying for it i would look to
yourselves

the loyal civil servant
i suppose
you will deny that shortchanging the
worker to whom compensation be due
be standard company policy

it would not surprise we if the
discrepancy be between medicine
send and medicine received

people die for such discrepancy

the hoarse voice of the
restaurant bomber
we must have a look at Eduards
file
cut

raban that be nearly at
the back of the alphabet

it usually be

i be not oblige to give you access
you know not without authorization
but i will make an exception this one
time

oblivious to the
danger
i be overwork as it be
find the right
section
raban do you say

yes
be not it there

wait a minute
raban
where
have i hear that name

he be the clerk who die last week
from the insurance department

what be the matter

why would we keep file on
dead
employee
all old file be send
up to the castle
do you think we
have room for two hundred year worth
personnel record

dodge another
paper landslide
it be go out so quickly

whenever an employee depart shall
we say it be up to the head of he
department to requisition he file
reassign any outstanding claim
and send it off

you mean i chief have it


excuse i sir i understand
you have eduard Rabans file

i do

i wonder if i might look to see
if there be an address for family
i think i would like to write
to they

no just as i think no
entry for family

be there something else

no i just i feel a sense of
obligation
he be i friend
if i can be of any help close
he affair

putting file away
again
no there be only one report to
complete
i will be do it myself
and submit it to the castle
today or tomorrow

as ingenuously as
possible
i see it be just the Erlanger
claim then

the
orlac
claim

sorry yes well thank you
sir

kafka

you be too sensitive
let you
friend rest in peace
returning to
paperwork
i have known suicide
such a song
anddance about nothing

yes sir

give it up


if it be account you wanted
why do you ask for employee

orlac be an account

it be a factory in the northern
mountain
one of we good
customer
as they disappear
around a corner
without a proper request i be not
oblige to do this you understand
but i will make an exception on
this one occasion

at least the account be current
even if the employee be not

that place have so many accident
it be a good thing the type of
peasant who live up there do not
seem to have any trouble propagate
they race

all these in the last year

you must have read about it in the
paper there be a terrible
cavein
it would not have be so
bad but even the medical officer
for the district be killed

i do read that
they give he
a posthumous medal

dr
murnau be the brave of man
he spent an entire career in those
backwater with no regard for
personal gain
great loss

this be the crossreference of
clerk who have work on orlac
claim

be you friend name among
they
kafka shake his
head
then he only worked on the one
case
taking file back
again
you chief will send i the final
summation when he be finished with
it

once a file be send to the
caste be it possible to recall
it for review

going back up
ladder
of course not
only by a director
of the firm
Whod want to let in
all kind of riffraff off the
street

what good be record if they be
not open for public inspection

stuffing file back
in place
these law have be with we for
century how can you doubt
they

what if i petition one of the
director

you do not summon they they
summon you and this of course
hardly ever happen if at all
the director be an eccentric lot
and by nature cautious

where do we record go to in the
castle

starting to walk
away
we be a medical firm be not we
they go to the medical record
section

i could always apply there

it so happen i dear simple sir
that the head of medical record at
the castle
be
one of the director
of this firm


do you mind

i be just trying to finish
some work

you mean you have actually begin
some

just because he be do nothing
today he do not want i to show
he up

i assistant
you might as well
have fallen from the sky for all
the thought that be spent in
choosing you

it be not we fault
we be
naturally nervous

and we be upset too

what be the matter with you

i can not make a simple statement
without he taking issue with it

you should meet i father

we have be together too long
he
personality be overflow into
mine and vice versa

how would
you
like to be in a
horrible situation like that

all right you might as well go
home go on





parcel
Burgels given she
she

well what be you waiting for



come on there be no one up
there
we be going now


that be it it be all right
you have do very well


never mind they they will be
attend to




design
behind it
human




oh and thank you for the suit
from father although i do not know
why he do not simply return it
if
it be too small for he why do you
immediately suppose it will fit i
you son
you love son
you somewhat love son
you
occasionally love son
you
incapableofloving son
you
absolutelyboredtodeathwithany
kindoffamilylife son

stack


the chief clerk would like this
ready for tomorrow morning
he say it should only take you
an extra hour or two

huge arm
have just be thrust through a small high window

help

monster
face this one even bad than the one


do you think you would be safe back
in you little burrow

no matter how deep a hole you dig
for yourself the beast will always
find you

we be to take you to the castle

so
you be the guide up there
and we think it be Burgel

they would not let
Burgel
into
the castle
you should look upon
this as a great favor

i do not want any favor from
the castle just i right

we answer directly to ekman the
senior partner he practically
run the castle
in a case like
this you be well off dealing with
the high authority even
though it be equally futile

when you speak to he you have to
lean quite near he right ear
because the left do not work so
well

for all you incompetence i be
beginning to think you be at
least loyal to i
you be very
good ham actor

just do we job

it be a farce

we think you would well accept you
position instead of pointlessly
annoy we

what position
be prosecute
in a case like this means have
already lost it

still we be probably close to you
at the moment than any of you
fellow human being

close only by virtue of antithesis

i assistant
i should have known
nothing be given to i
i have to
acquire everything

it be all right to be sarcastic in
private to we because we have a
sense of humor but when we be up
at the castle we suggest you do not
make a fuss
it would spoil the
not unfavorable impression you make
in other respect

frankly we do not understand why
you have even bothered pursue this
business

it would be more accurate to say
that it have pursue i

but you goal be so hard to reach
do you think the official network
would surrender to one man
we
would never think of attempting
anything remotely as difficult

i mother used to tell we of the
young man who decided to ride to
the next village and how she be
afraid that not even mentioning
accident the span of a normal
happy life might fall far short of
the time needed for such a trip

you have drop some money


you work in the cemetery

man must eat
and drink

the
castle
cemetery

jump
when a tall plant brush against he

be you sure you would not prefer
going through official channel

official channel a lot of good
they have do i
i only hope be
to approach the official personally
bomb
briefcase
he find at Eduards

i be flattered of course to be
considered a friend even without
knowing all the detail
kafka do not take
that cue
to see such determination be
reward enough for i

the kafka man be famous for it
you know
deliver meat barefoot
in the depth of winter picking up
sack of flour with they tooth

oh yes determination run in
the family

there be
one
thing i would like you
to tell i

i be trying to find thing out myself
that be the whole point

what make you think
i would
be able to
get you into the castle

the cemetery be near the castle
than anywhere else be not it part
of the castle originally
i
always assumed there would be a gate or
something
be not there

in a manner of speaking


i be restoring some stone here
in the upper section one day
and i find this

an empty tomb

cenotaph a monument to someone
whose remains end up elsewhere
but look

the castle gate be blockade
in the time of the great plague
it be an escape route
offer kafka the
lantern
do not get stick

not a chance
i be the thin
person i know

you appreciate i write

yes

will you do i a favor then

another one

if i do not see you later go
to i house and find i notebook
and destroy they
all i
manuscript just burn they
please

what an extraordinary request

it be i last and final one

then it authority be in doubt

true friend would do it

not necessarily

wife
would

inside a big file cabinet
drawer



you have killed he
like a dog

they will not like that
not a bit

i do not

you will incriminate the rest of we
let i out too

help we
release we

you be in the bowel now i friend
you have throw yourself in it now

let
i
out i be all right they
have not
treated
i yet
we can go
together


you

endless
desk
they look like
actual
conveyor a chain
ink


be you lost

i be uh looking for the
medical record section

oh you be mile away
from here
you will want to go leave left again
right right again left then right
right then left and take the blue
staircase

thank you

i have not see you here before

no

i be new

bestial hand




lunge
at he from one
tattoo
on it bearded anarchist


i assume you be wonder
what
all this have be about

be you the head of medical
record

he be come on he own initiative
not something we encourage mind
you but we like to know it exist

what it amount to be simply this

piece of paper be deliver to
the wrong clerk
it be essential
he bring it back to we
these
complication have arise because he
have friend like you among
other friend unlikely to let a
sleep dog lie

piece of paper

mere slip
you friend mr
raban deal only
with claim that come
in
another
department be responsible for
compensation that go out this
be correct

not quite in the
light yet
through a very unfortunate and
i might add extremely rare
mishap a document intended for
the one department be send to
the other
and for the first
time though you friend
be not aware of it two and
two could have be put together
to make one

piece of paper

face bending into
the light
you see kafka in all case
relate to the factory at
orlac which be what this
paper referred to the
authority that put in a
request and the authority that
grant it be to all intent
and purpose the same authority



you seem amuse

it only amuse i in that
it give i an insight into
the ludicrous bungling that
in some circumstance may
decide the life of a human being

it be merely a matter of
expediency
it be imperative
that i room to maneuver not
be hinder by
bureaucratic
ramification

if an obscure official up
there in the distant mountain
so far away from civilizing
influence happen to meet
with an unfortunate accident
and should he tragically die
in spite of the district medical
officer strenuous effort to
save he the firm want to
see the next of kin pacify
and the disposition of the
remain handle with the
great possible
efficiency

accident and compensation
no one can accuse the firm of
not supplying exactly what it
promise

i believe we have exceeded his
expectation

virtually to
himself
i have the grand of financial
plot in mind the most
malevolent of personal motive
conspiracy theory extend
to every
authority i could
see
and i find you
body snatcher

life be more than a chinese
puzzle i friend



and i suppose dr
murnau do not
die in a cavein
you killed
he to free the position of
orlac medical officer for you
own end

yes well we be looking for
a new village now
if we stay
too long at one source
people
become suspicious

but you be quite right that
he do not die in that cavein
in fact he do not die at all
he be simply recalled by
himself
as well as be head
of medical record here
and
a
director of you firm i be
dr
murnau of course

may i ask where you two
warder be

lying in the gutter where
they belong

pity
they be an amuse pair
do not you find
absolute
innocent

i so rarely get the chance of
showing i work to anybody
anybody capable of appreciate
it that be
you might say i be
a student of human reaction

the fact that it be live body
you practice you trade on
do not seem to matter to you

on the contrary it matter a
great deal
we be engaged in
immensely important research
here
i be a revolutionary
too you know but a much
more pragmatic one

i can not very well administer
experimental treatment to
corpse and if they become
corpse why they have they
use too that be why speed be
essential
live tissue even
if it owner have passed on be
we most valuable acquisition

we have tried transfusion on
we
volunteer
unfortunately
far from infuse superior
characteristic it be tend to
make they insane murderous
even a condition we have have
occasion to make use of

and the new patient they
bring i be not usually as
dexterous as you have be in
evade we
not perfect
specimen by any means but
not the type of person who will
be missed either

what have you do with
gabriela rossmann

as a matter of fact you have
caught we in a state of
considerable excitement
we
late preparation we believe
we pray be perfected
it should take year off she

and if not well there be
always what i call i caprice
of vivisection

actually if it be not for
the aberrant dilemma pose by
someone like yourself
continually asking for outofdate
file i would probably give up i
revisionist policy altogether
i be sure what we have to do be
start instead at the very
inception with the embryo
from a single cell even
the lure of the golem the
manmade man
you appreciate
that i know

to corrupt the image of man
and then offer redemption
this
be the dawn kafka
new man be
be born here
more resilient
man
superman

to a new world of god
and monster





oskar

ludwig

this be file incorrectly

here too
they be all in a
dreadful muddle



gabriela
you do get away

i know you walk this way to
work
i wanted to find you
before they do

i have just come from the
castle
it be over

she eye glance
far away
over
it be only over when
you can crawl to a clean little
spot on earth where the sun
sometimes shine and you can warm
yourself a bit

gabriela

should i tell you why i joined
we late lament nihilist
why i become a murderer
because murder
be bliss
it be easy than you might
think to absorb and assimilate
evil once you have adopted it
procedure

have you ever watch a person
deteriorate
day by day
i
do not mean in a spiritual sense

only two step back
even the
man they left to guard i
retreat far than that

i i find you jailer

this be the result of they
elixir of youth
they be
to come and check on it during
the night
i contrived to
miss the appointment

they be dead now
we can
get help

i know how they reward failure
if they see this i would be rot
in the quarry by the afternoon
with all the other

there be a new potion he
said it be perfected

i know there be
and you be
what i have to bargain with
for now you be the last one
in they way

i told you they be
dead
it be
finished

why should i believe a man who
never believe i
they be
absolutely right you know
guilt should never be doubt
it be easy that way

i think you have just escaped for
the moment
just as i do
as
eduard do
as they let we do
but only for the moment

no not this time

i know good than you what
people will say when they have
to
when they bring i in
for questioning i informed on i
friend the very first day

listen to i

i do
always
you understand
the world good than any of
we kafka
and what it be
becoming
i have always hold you in the
high regard
knife
across Kafkas chest
he

gabriela


dear father

you ask i recently why i
maintain that i be afraid
of you


naturally thing cannot in
reality fit together the way
the evidence do in i letter
life be more than a chinese
puzzle
but in i opinion
something have be achieve
which so closely approximate
the truth that it might reassure
we both a little and make we
live and we die easy


we could go back to the office
explain ourselves to the chief
clerk

they would drive we away
that
Kafkas make thing very hot
for we

i understand he be wounded
in the lung

it do not matter
it be too
late for all of we

look at

what be to become of we now

look at

amerika
that be the place to go

everyone in amerika have a
toaster in they build

then that be the place for we

amerika for we

amerika
