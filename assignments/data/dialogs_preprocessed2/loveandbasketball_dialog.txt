hard work
and sacrifice
there be a lot of basketball history and
pride here at but just putting on
the cardinal and gold do not make you a
great player
hard work and sacrifice
make you a great player
what you be
do not matter anymore
for the first
time in you life you will not be the good
you will be going up against woman that be
big and strong and good than you
ever imagined
so the question be how
will you respond
well you answer
well be hard work and sacrifice because
that be the only way you be going to make it
through
vince lombardi preach it and
i teach it there be only one way to
succeed at anything and that be to give
everything


few simple rule
eleven of the clock
curfew no exception
always be on
time no exception
attend every class
no exception
no drug no alcohol no
get pregnant
and finally respect
yourselves respect you coach and
respect you teammate right Sidra

that be right coach

by the end of this year some of you will
hate i

some of you will want to go home

cree

but i guarantee you if you work hard and
sacrifice all of you will be good
basketball player and good people

i remember when i be eight year old
you spent like four hour cooking up this
fancy meal
all you would let i and lena do
be set the table
and i guess you and
dad get you wire crossed or something
because he walk in with a couple of
pizza
and you do not say anything
you just threw the whole meal into some
tupperware and toss it in the fridge

i do not remember that

you never stand up for yourself
ever
if i be ashamed it be because
of that

could start i cater business
and
then i get pregnant with lena and then i
get pregnant with you

of i mind because that be what you do

but you want to know what day i remember
in high school you get ready for the
spring dance
i put i pearl around
you neck told you you be beautiful
and you look like you be going to
cry
that day i be happy i do not have
a cater business to run off to
i
family have three meal a day have someone
to pick up after they and when i

maybe i miss some of
the attention but besides that

you be serious

seem like i needed a ball when i be
trying to be like i pop
or trying to

thing yet
she will probably say it be the painkiller
talking

it be a trip you know
when you be a
kid you see the life you want and it
never cross you mind that it be not
going to turn out that way

so why you give up ball

why do you keep asking i that

because i do not get it
