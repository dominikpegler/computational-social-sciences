you majesty would wish to know the
true fact concerning the island of
Hispanola we first settlement in
the new world and the activity
there of you servant christopher
columbus admiral of the ocean sea
governor of that island
you will
remember with what hope and
promise he beguile we the truth
be that he now preside over a state
of chaos degradation and madness
beyond imagine

from the begin columbus prove
himself incapable of managing the
affair of the island
he appointed
he brother to important position
at once injure the pride and
dignity of the noble who have go
with he
he promised to build a
city the city of isabel named
after you majesty
what he
actually build be nothing but a
collection of hut and that in the
wrong place for all of it be
easily sweep away by rain and mud
be that not so brother Buyl

yes you honor

he promised gold
not finding the
easy quantity he promised
columbus command each indian to
pay an annual tribute
most being
unable to they be barbarously
punished against the express wish
of you christian majesty

since provocation and injustice
never cease many of the indian
have flee to the forest or have
begin to slay the christian

could it be so

yes you majesty

but there be bad
from the
begin he forced the noble to
undergo physical labor treat
they equally with the indian all
of they reduced to slavery
when
the nobleman adrian de Moxica
protest against such treatment
he be executed
be that not true also brother
Buyl

yes you honor
it be all true
all of it
i see it with i own
eye

he have lost control
he great
arrogance have lead he into
depravity
he encourage we
soldier to marry the native woman
he promised a paradise but he have
make a hell full of all it horror

be that the man i know treasurer
sanchez

yes you majesty




of all the word i father write and
there be many i remember these
the most
nothing that result
from human progress be achieve with
unanimous consent




and those who be enlighten
before the other be condemned to
purse that light in spite of
other




there be a time when the new world
do not exist




the sun set in the west on an
ocean where no man have dare to
venture
and beyond that
infinity



once i ask i father where he
wanted to go
and he reply
i
want to travel all over the sea
i
want to get behind the weather



fernando

diego

diego
be not you going to kiss
you brother

diego take fernando to the dine
hall
he must be hungry

yes father

diego be a bright boy a pleasure
to teach but so serious
brother should be raised together
colon
even brother from different
mother

father i be do what i think be
the good for he
and he have the
teacher i would have chosen for
myself

just be careful you do not lose he

fumble in a pocket
under he robe
i have something for you

you will be hear at the university
of salamanca

god
that be in a week

that be what it say

how do you manage it

with some difficulty
i have to
promise they you be not a total
fool

why do you wish to sail west

to open a new route to asia
at the
moment there be only two way of
reaching it

by sea sailing around the african
continent the journey take a
year

or by land



but the turk have closed this
route to all christian
trading
with the orient have become arduous
if not dangerous
there be a third way

by sailing west across the ocean
sea

how can you be so certain
the
ocean be say to be infinite

ignorance
i believe the indies be
no more than league west of the
canary islands

how can you be so certain

the calculation of toscanelli marin
de tyr Esdras

Esdras be a jew

so be christ

two minute
and already you be a
dead man
do not let passion
overwhelm you colon

i will try to remember that
Marchena

father Marchena

passion be something one cannot
control

you get so carry away when you be
be contradict

i have be contradict all i
life
eternity

only god know the meaning of such
word i son

diego

would you like to come and stay with
we

i will do whatever make you happy

i be happy father

look father

fernando

fernando

execution
in the square

they have agreed to see i in a week

i could be go for year

i know

i have not given you much of a life

well
that be true
i have a child
by a man who will not marry i
who be
always leaving

be we going to argue

i would love to argue with you
sometimes
but you be never here

perhaps i be never mean to live
with a woman

i find that hard to believe


fernando do not you think we be
lucky to live with such a beautiful
woman

christopher columbus

you say asia can be find by sail
west

yes you eminence
the voyage
should not take more than six or
seven week

unfortunately don colon that be
precisely where we opinion
differ
be you familiar with the work of
aristotle
Erathostene
Ptolemeus

i be you eminence

then you cannot ignore that
accord to they calculation the
circumference of the earth be
approximately
league or more
which make
the ocean
uncrossable

but you may have find new evidence
proving that these man of knowledge
be totally mistaken

you excellency be aware of the
statement of marin de tyr

we be

then you be also aware that he
theory contradict Ptolemeus
de
tyr believe the ocean to be only
league

the florentine toscanelli and the
french cardinal pierre dailly both
think that marin de tyr be accurate
in he calculation
and therefore
that the ocean can be cross

gentleman let we suppose marin de
tyr be right
the laughter
subside
be we here to examine this proposal
or not

in you opinion how long would the
voyage be

seven week
six during the summer
month

marin de tyr be wrong and have
be correct many time over the
century by the fine geographer
you voyage don colon would take a
year

how would the crew survive without
be able to land for fresh water
water be undrinkable after six
week
you would never be able to turn
back

we would not have to turn back
we
would find land at this point

senor colon an experience captain
such as yourself will understand we
concern with the crew
i be not
will to have on i conscience the
loss of man who would have rely
upon we judgment

excellency you be right

i be a seaman not a scholar
but
as a simple man craving for
knowledge i have read all the work
of these renowned geographer and
discover that none of they could
agree on the exact width of this
ocean

therefore as a modest man i
wonder
who be right

who be right
this question remains
unanswered

you eminence there be only one way
to settle the matter
and that be
to make the journey
to the assembly
with passion
i be ready to risk i life to prove
it possible

you life and that of other

if they agree to follow i yes



suppose you cross this ocean
suppose you reach asia
what would
spain do there

trade you excellency
accord
to marco polo the kingdom of china
be one of the rich of the world
even the mean building be
roof with gold

be that all that interest you
gold

no
the portuguese have already
discover blackskinned people
i
too will find other population
and bring they to the word of god

christopher christo ferens the
bearer of the cross

and colon the one who populate

if god intended we proximity to
asia do you believe he would have
wait for you to show it to the
world

do he not choose a carpenter son
to reveal himself to the world

so you consider yourself the choose
one

do not you realize you word could
be considered heretical

blind faith be what i consider
heresy

asia can be find to the west and
i will prove it



the treasurer of spain honors we
with he presence

the state have some reason to be
interest in this mane
proposition you eminence

the judgment be ours

naturally
but i would really
deplore the loss of such a potential
opportunity for spain for a
dispute over a point of geography

he be a mercenary
do he not
already try to convince the king of
portugal of he absurd notion

indeed
the world be full of
mercenary and state often make
use of they when it benefit they
i only concern be the welfare and
prosperity of spain

you would use you influence to
assist this
intriguer

you know you eminence the
fascinating thing about power be
that what can be given so
effortlessly

can so easily be taken away

and therefore nothing could
justify the participation of you
highness in the venture that
rely upon such feeble assumption
and which any man of knowledge
would take to be impractical
if
not impossible

they do not listen
they do not
want to listen

you must not give way to despair
you must wait

wait
i have wait seven year
already
how much long do you
want i to wait

if god intend you to go then you
will go

damn god

colon

damn all of you
you all set up
theory base on what
you never
leave the safety of you study
go out
find out what the world be
about and then tell i something i
can listen to

these do not mean anything
they be
full of assumption
out of the
head of old man who have never be
past the end of they garden

no
i book

all of they
just lie

colon
do not

father

Sssshhhh
one can not speak to a
man doing penance

what can you do

nothing
that be the point
fernando



senor colon

ah thank god
i have be looking
all over seville for you
never
expected to find a sailor in a
monastery eh

monk
be he a spy

Santangel tell i you be a man of
honor and sincerity
and sanchez
that you be not a fool

no more than the woman who said she
would take granada from the moor

the ocean be uncrossable

what do they say about granada
before today

that she be impregnable

i cannot ignore the verdict of i
council

surely you can do anything you want

how little you know

may i speak freely

you show no inclination to speak
otherwise

i know what i see
i see someone
who do not accept the world as it
be
who be not afraid
i see a
woman who think
what if

familiarity
woman

but you be the only
queen i know
