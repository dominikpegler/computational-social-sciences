few thousand dollar down the
drain if you ask i

oh really

thousand for it at the contemporary
picture sale last june

you could have a great beach house
for that

sure you could in wildwood new
jersey
if you sold this
indicate a rothko
hanging near the OKeefe

penthouse on fifth

fine of it kind

that tea dip linen for the
upholstery too dingy

PreColumbian pot in the center of
the coffee table
some dope might

other people money

gentleman be under siege from
gordon gekko
Teldar paper be now leveraged to
the hilt like some piss poor south
american country
instead of use
we cash to build plant build we
business all this man really want
be to get paid to withdraw his
tender offer and that will cost we
approximately another million
in greenmail which will be passed
on to the consumer

where do you get off speaking about
i like that making remark to the
press i resent these remark i
demand the right to speak

sit down sir you be out of order
have not you do enough damage to
Teldar as it be
have you no
sense of decency
how can you management

concentrate on long term growth
when we be busy fighting the get
richquick short term profit slot
machine mentality of wall street
when we should be fighting japan
the original fundamental reason for
wall street be to capitalize
american business underwrite new
business build company build
america
the deal have now
succeed goods and service as
americas gross national product
and in the process we be
undermine we foundation
this
cancer be called greed
greed and
speculation have replace longterm
investment
corporation be be
taken apart like erector set
without any consideration of the
public good
i strongly recommend
you to see through mr
Gekkos
shameless intention here to
strip this company and severely
penalize the stockholder
i
strongly recommend you to reject
he tender by voting for
management restructure of the
stock


i appreciate the chance you be
giving i mr
cromwell as the
single large stockholder in
Teldar to speak
get some laughter
and applause loosen
on the way here today i see a
bumper sticker
it said life be a
bitch
then you die
well lady and gentleman we be
not here to indulge in fantasy
but in political and economic
reality
america have become a
second rate power
we trade
deficit and fiscal deficit be at
nightmare proportion
in the day
of the free market when we
country be a top industrial power
there be accountability to the
shareholder
the Carnegies the
mellons the man who build this
industrial empire make sure of it
because it be they money at stake
today management have no stake in
the company
altogether these guy
sitting up there own a total of
less than and where do mr
cromwell put he million dollar
salary
certainly not in Teldar
stock he own less than
you own Teldar paper the
stockholder and you be be
royally screw over by these
bureaucrat with they steak
lunch golf and hunt trip
corporate jet and golden
parachute
Teldar paper have
different vice president each
earn over a year
i
spent two month analyze what
these guy do and i still can not
figure it out

this be an outrage gekko
you be
full of shit

one thing i do know be this paper
company lost million last
year and i would bet half of that be
in the paperwork going back and
forth between all the vice
president
increase laughter
he be get they
the new law of evolution in
corporate america seem to be
survival of the unfittest
well
in i book you either do it right
or you get eliminate
Teldar paper
be doomed to fail
it
diversification into casualty
insurance have not work
it crown
jewel be it tree the rest be
dross
through war depression
inflation and deterioration of
paper money tree have always keep
they value but Teldar be chopping
they all down
forest be
perishable forest right be as
important as human right to this
planet and all the illusory
maginot line scorched earth
tactic proxy fight poison
pill etc
that mr
cromwell be going to come up with
to prevent people like i from
buying Teldar paper be doomed to
fail because the bottom line
lady and gentleman as you very
well know be the only way to stay
strong be to create value that be
why you buy stock to have it go up
if there be any other reason i have
never hear it
that be all i be saying
it be you
people who own this company not
they they work for you and they have
do a lousy job of it
get rid of
they fast before you all get sick
and die
i may be an opportunist
but if these clown do a good
job i would be out of work
in the
last seven deal i have be in
there be
million stockholder
that actually make a pretax profit
of billion
when i buy the
Ixtlan corporation it be in the
exact same position Teldar be
today i turned three of it
company private and i sold four
other and each of these
company liberated from the
suffer conglomerate have
prosper
i be not a destroyer of
company i be a liberator of they
the point be lady and gentleman
greed be good
greed work greed
be right
greed clarify cut
through and capture the essence
of the evolutionary spirit
greed
in all it form greed for life
money love knowledge have marked
the upward surge of mankind and
greed mark i word will save
not only Teldar paper but that
other malfunction corporation
called the

time do you

of course

please help yourselves to some
food


look i have no illusion about
winning a popularity contest with
any of you
i be roast the other
night and a friend of mine ask
why be we honoring this manhave
we run out of human being

it be not always the most popular
guy who get the job do
you get
loss of to million dollar
dividend cut to zero you be
get squeezed to death by the
major
present management may not
be the bad scum of the earth but
they be the one who have put you on
a kamikaze course and pretty soon
everybody going to be scrambling
for the parachute
only there
be not enough to go around
management have they
you do not
if
they throw Bluestar into chapter
which i think they willthen
they can use bankruptcy law to
break you union and you
contract and throw you guy off
the property

with all due respect mr
gekko
what be to prevent you from do
the same thing

because i have a way around all this
a way we can all make money and
make this airline profitable again
what do you say we cut to the chase
i be asking for a modest twenty
percent acrosstheboard wage cut

and seven more hour a month

what kind of time frame be we
talking about here

give i a year
if we be still
losing money the reduction stand
if however we move into the black
i return part of the givebacks
salary go back to present level
and
we institute an employee profit
sharing program with stock
you will
own part of the airline

be you prepare to put that in
write

i will have a letter of agreement
draw up within two day

what be you markete strategy
how
do you plan to return we to
profitability

why do not i give bud an opportunity
to answer that

thank you mr
gekko
first of all i
want you to know i door will
always be open to you because i know
from i dad it be you guy that keep
Bluestar fly
one modernize
we computer software be weak we
update it we squeeze every dollar
out of each seat and mile fly
you do not sell a seat to a guy for
when he be will to pay
effective inventory management
through computerization will
increase we load factor by to
that translate to
approximately to million
dollar in revenue
the point be
we can beat the major at a price
war
two advertising more
more and aggressive attack the
major
three expand we hub to
atlanta north carolina and dallas
reorganize all we feeder schedule
think big guy we be going
after the major

card be on the table
what do you
think

if you mean what you say i think
we be in the ball park
i will take
it to i people

you have sketched some broad stroke
i would like to see the fine print
but
so far so good

i guess if a man life long enough
he get to see everything
and i
mean everything
what else do you
have in you bag of trick mr
gekko

frankly carl i can not see giving
much more
if you have any
suggestion i will be glad to listen

there come into egypt a pharoah who
do not know

i beg you pardon

difference between the pyramid and
the empire state build be that

greedhe be in and out for the buck
and he do not take prisoner

do not give a damn about northstar
or we

now wait a minute dad

deal go through we all gain

course i son do work three
summer as a baggage handler and
freight loader
with those
qualification why should i doubt
he ability to run an airline

fine if you do not want we stay
with the scum in present
managementdedicated to running
you and Bluestar into the ground

that scum build this company
up from one plane in thirty year

and if that be a scum i will take one
over a rat any day

machinist who can not stand that he
sones become more successful than
himself
