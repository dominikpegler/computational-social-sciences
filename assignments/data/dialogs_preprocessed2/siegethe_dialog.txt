folk as you can probably tell we
have begin we descent into
washingtons national airport

you alright



either we answer this threat quickly
and convincingly or next week there
be a hundred more all over the world



sound great general except why
can not we find out who be behind it

these sect be organized so you
need a kill to you credit to get
inside
it make undercover operation
impossible
what that leaf we be
we be working on it

how about who be behind who be behind
this

libya
iraq
iran
possibly syria

ask a question
get an atlas

all i know be that we must respond

respond sure
but how

find out who it be and bomb the shit
out of they

and if we can not find out

look it keep escalate
first a
bus then the theatre
what be next

anything but leadership

with all respect senator why do not
we just stipulate that the president
be a dumb son of a bitch so we can
all get down to business



what about sending in the guard



the national guard be trained for
riot control not counterterrorism

the army then
i have see the
contingency plan

it be settled legal doctrine posse
comitatus that the army not be turn
against we own people

even if that be what we own people
be asking for three to one

if the president be will to declare
a state of emergency

president lincoln declared martial
law in
he suspended

which the supreme court later
find unconstitutional
ex parte
milligan

and i have get an election in november
ExUnited states congressman

guy guy the president lost a lot
of friend last night

not to mention six point in the
poll

and he plane land in two hour
we owe it to he to have a consensus

you do not fight a junkyard dog with
rule
what you do be take the
leash off you own big mean
dog

general

the army be a broadsword not a
scalpel
you do not want we in an
american city

but hypothetically
how long would
it take you to

we only go if the president invoke
the war power act

i understand that general
let we
imagine though for a moment that
the order have be given

twelve hour after the president
give the word we can be on the
ground
one light infantry division
of ten thousand seven hundred man
element of the rapid deployment
force combined with special force
delta
APCs tank helicopter
and of course the ubiquitous
assault rifle a humble weapon until
you see a man carrying one outside
you local bowl alley or seven
eleven
it will be noisy it will be
scary and it will not be mistaken
for a parade

that mean civilian casualty
at a
minimum it be a drink private joyride
in a hummer who run down an old
lady in Greenpoint
at a maximum
make no mistake
we will hunt the
enemy
we will find the enemy
and
we will kill the enemy

and no cardcarrying member of the
be more deadset against it
than i be
which be why i urge you
no i implore you not to consider
this option

i know what the president will say

what be that

that be exactly why you be the only
man for the job

i remind you general Devereaux do
not speak for official army policy
police function have become accepted
as we role in haiti in somalia

could i interrupt

that be anthony hubbard
he be
the on the ground up there
they take out the first cell less
than hour after bus
i suggest
we hear what he have to say

there be something you probably
have not think about do

and that be

nothing
do not overreact
with all respect gentleman i be
just a cop
to you these people may
be martyr but to i they be
criminal
and a criminal be no more
than somebody who think he be good
than everyone else
and he be not
well
he only have to be wrong once
and that be where we come in
we run
down a tip from a landlord or we
pick up a latent print from a bus
we phone be ringing off the hook
with people from the arab community
wanting to help

they love this country and they hate
that these criminal be giving they
a bad name
with they help and some
oldfashion shoe leather we will
nail these guy

amen to that

thank you agent hubbard
i too
think we should proceed cautiously

a terrorist network
one cell
controlling all other
cut off the
head and the body will wither

unfortunately the old wisdom no longer
apply
the new paradigm be like
the myth of the hydra
each cell
exist independent of the other
cut
off one head and another rise up in
it place

bus be the work of cell
it
elimination only activate the work
of cell the theatre gala

do we
have he

to refresh you memory as i told
you last time it be the libyan
who

i remember perfectly well what you
said last time
do we

let i give you some free advice
son
do not get between i and the
president
you might break a nail

i be speaking for the president

as far as the president be
concern
no we do not

general do you know that after
yesterday attack half the parent
in this country keep they child
out of school
they be attack we way of life
it be get to stop
and the president
cannot afford to be weak

be you saying the president be
prepared to take the necessary
step

i be saying the president be prepared
to be
presidential


hubbard
what

slow down
slow down


today with the invocation of the
war power act by the president i
be declare a state of martial law
in this city

to the good of we knowledge we be
opposed by no more than twenty of
the enemy
he be hide among a
population of roughly two million

intelligence tell we he be most
likely Arabspeaking between the
age of fourteen and thirty
narrow
the target to fifteen thousand
suspect

we can **further/far reduce that number
down to those who have be in this
country less than six month
now
you have twenty hide among two
thousand

if you be one of these twenty young
man you can hide among a population
of similar ethnic background
unfortunately for you you can only
hide there
and that population in
the classic immigration pattern be
concentrated
right here in brooklyn

we intend to seal off this borough
and then we intend to squeeze it
this be the land of opportunity
gentleman
the opportunity to turn
yourselves in
after sundown tonight
any young man fitting the profile i
described who have not cooperate
will be arrested and detain

would you follow i please
the
general be expect you

there be historically nothing more
corrosive to the morale of an army
than policing it own citizen

but the enemy would be sadly mistaken
if they be to doubt we resolve
they be now face to face with the
most fearsome kill machine in the
history of man
and i intend to use
it
and be back on base in time for
the playoff
that be all

hub
good to see you again

i can not say the same sir

six hour

it do not work in belfast
it do not

it come slowly at
first then in a
rush

what if
they do not want they
leader back at all
you said yourself
we do not even have he
maybe what
they really want be that we herd
we child into stadium
put
soldier into we street
radicalize
people who want to think of themselves
as american
bend the law shred
the constitution
search for the
kind of word that
come so hard to he

because if we torture he and
let we call it what it be
you
and i
then the country man like
we have sworn to defend
and bleed to
defend
and die to defend
be
go
and they have win

to col
hardwick
i think we have to soundproof the
room before we begin

escort he out

let we get this over with


he know nothing


mon in we be still trying to get
the last one down

the president want this shit
over with
there be only one way to
do that
let the sheik go

so we do have the sheik

you think we government operate as
a single coherent entity
Devereaux
just
push the agenda
of course the president be completely
unaware of it

of course

now we can not just let he go
america
have to stand tall in the world yadda
yadda yadda
so what we do be
we let the american justice system
do it work

honey

i will be right up darling

you have kid
they be great
sometimes you just want to
drug
they

what do you mean let the justice
system do it work

we do not release he
judge release
he
you be an man
that be what
judge be good at right
it be not like we have go after he
in proper prosectorial fashion
Kidnaping he
holding he in
isolation
fruit of the poison
tree remember that one from law
school
oh we will have a big trial
Everybodyll get they rock off
but the fact be
the sheik will walk

and this whole episode become
nothing more than the news cycle
before the next news cycle

documentary evidence of Devereauxs
whole operation

why i

because you will know what to do with
it

and what about she

who

you know who
how much be she
complicit in all this

ask she

i run an iraqi network for two year
samir recruited they from among the
sheik follower
i trained they in
the north
then we play they back
into baghdad two three at a time
hide they in the mosque

it be going to be beautiful
and then there be a policy shift

the new doctrine be
iran will
be too powerful if iraq fall apart
and it be not like
we sold they
out
exactly
we just
stopped
helping they
and i be not allow
to tell they what be coming down
i
be ordered not to tell they
and they get slaughter

you have get to understand these
people
believe
paradise
bliss
to we they be just word
but to
they
it be very beautiful actually
and when you look at they live
the heartbreak
and what do we do
we think aha we can take advantage
of that
so i quit
i come home
i just
can not
do it
anymore

but first you helped they

what do you mean
