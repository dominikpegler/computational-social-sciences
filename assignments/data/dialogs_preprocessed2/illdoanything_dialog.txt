i also have a
way
what i do be interview first
then readmaybe do it all over again
the next day
i call up people the
actor have work withcheck he
out
if he be famous i do an opinion
survey to test how much people like
he
if he be not famous i put he
on tape and show it to everyone i
can grab
i believe in screen test
i believe in replace if the daily
be bad in cutting people out if

where they serve cappucino in the
lobby
i be do popcorn movie
you

so if you
could read this rewrite now and if
you like it we can make a test
deal

okay
which part

longfellow deed

mr
deed

who go to town yes

who be we kidding
i be even have
trouble get short partsI be
going to say i love it no matter
what you have do to it

stop be so creepy honest
i really
have an instinct about you for this
i be going homecall i when you
finish reading it
how quickly status
change thing
or
come on over

why not
if you can test movie and
premise and wanttosees why can not
you test screen test

i can not deal with you selfcentered
dribble right now
i have just have
the big orgasm of i life and
i be trying to figure out if i be in
love with you

what

whoops
tell i what make you rush
over and pick i up and bring i
here at six of the clock
i mean we seem
to have

this unspoken agreement not to
talk about why we be together when
we be together and i do not think
it be good to let that become a pattern
for we

why do i rush to you
because i
feel like i have to
be with someone
and you be close
what be wrong

you be not at all aware that you have
just said something
unattractive

look i be sorry if that come out

i be not looking for an apology

i be just trying to say that one of
the thing i be not great at be

let we not make this about you
shortcoming
i be sure you have have
enough of those conversation to
last you a lifetime
what i be

no i have not

no you have not what

have a conversation about
shortcoming

no woman have ever tell you that you
have an almost barbaric insensitivity
that you seem to have lapse into
some final cynicism where you
actually believe that not only do
everyone think the way you do but
only you have the courage to express
it
that you seem horribly certain
everyone else be sort of pretend
when they talk about love or seem to
care for anything outside they own
anus
no one ever said that sort
of thing to you

oh yeah
but i do not get what
you mean by shortcoming
hey if
you think thing like that what be
you do here

i be here for the same reason
percent of old woman loved beauty
and the beast
i would like to
believe that underneath the creature
there be a sweet caring guy

i sure hope you be wrong

i have to pick up leslie

i mistime it
sticking she head
out the door
i wanted you to catch i fully
frontal

so you loved it
lot
little

give i a secondall of a sudden
there be a lot to deal with

it be terrific

do you see why i think you be right

because you be nice and you know i
need work

you know this be really happening
so i wish you would not kid around
about it

sorry but i think the audition rule
be that i have to be serious unless
the person in charge be wearing a
bathrobe and she nipple be sticking
out
this much

there be some mixed signal coming
out of here be not there
phone ring
she
answer

number now
call i back

nervous think about the
opportunity

you want
to go page by page

i kind of work on these
thing in a private
it be just
it be a little good for i if i
do not

okay
