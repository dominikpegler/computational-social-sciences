he give a soft laugh finding something amuse in the
sound of the name

if i have a choice i would prefer
rachel to feed i
so gentle
in
another life the making of a
nurse i think
in another
life
david continue to feed careful to appear immune to vogel

how be she today

it be a dangerous time the first
month or two of the pregnancy
david stare at he unable to hide he shock

you do not know
vogel absorb this thoughtfully

you be not the father then
i think it would be you
i think
i do not know

david stir the oatmeal trying to think about what he be
just discover
vogel do not take he eye off he

woman can be like that they like
to make you dance first i
remember

so she choose the other one
he shake he head shrug

that must be hard watch they
together right in front of you
and you not saying a word
like
the poet say great soul
suffer in silence
i would not
have taken stephan as a family
man
too ambitious too
whereas you
david i see you
with child

shut up
vogel stare at he
this be the first time someone have
spoken to he in week
he be quick to hide he sense of
triumph

i be express i sympathy
for
you suffer

what do a monster like you know
about suffer




i be a doctor david
david stare at he

doctor
you blind
child trying to change the
colour of they eye
you inject
people with petrol
you
you
replace people hand and leg
and you watch as they
he stop himself

this be not medicine
this be
disease
this be sickness
vogel seem to consider this

so we be all insane
be that
the answer

there be no answer
i be not
looking for an answer
i be not
looking for
he force himself to be silent try to regain control of
himself
he offer vogel another spoonful but he hand
tremble a little with the violence of he emotion

you be trembling
david push the spoon into Vogels mouth start to load
another spoonful

it be strange
here i be the
victim kidnap bound soon to
be murdered but i think you be
the one that be afraid david
afraid of the monster
he lean closer to david

boo
they stare at each other eye to eye
vogel sense a new
brittleness in david
he tone become more assure




yes
do you know why it be easy
to exterminate you people
you weakness
i see it
every
day i see it
every one of they
think only of how to avoid
be flog or kick or
killed
only think of
themselves
david look up at he with a strange crook smile eye
glitter

why do you think it only take
four soldier to lead a thousand
people to the gas chamber
entire family
because not one
out of thousands have the courage
to resist the courage to be the
first to fall
not one would
sacrifice himself
even when we
take they child from they
i
know then that you people have no
right to live no right to
he may have begin he speech hope to get a reaction from
david but he have lost himself in he rant and so rather
than triumph we see only a moment of startle fear in his
eye as david suddenly swing the bowl violently at his
head on the pipe to which he be tied
he grab vogel by the collar and begin to punch he hard
again and again
vogel slide sideways limp
and still david punch he in
a murderous rage possessed wanting to break he skull
open to kill he
rachel and stephan run in with rachel reaching he first
she throw she arm around he trying to stop he but
instinctively he throw a punch behind he
it connect
split she lip and sending she fly to the ground
stephan run at he knocking he to the floor and remain
lying on he the two of they breathing hard the assault
finally over
slump forward hold up only by the rope at his
wrist binding he to the pipe on the wall
stephan be still struggling with david who be panting
adrenalised stare wildly at Vogels slump body

out
we be going out
he begin to drag he out
stephan nod in the direction of


be you going to be alright
rachel nod
as she hear the door close she turn to stare at vogel
he be barely conscious he face smeared with blood




rachel drenches a cloth under the tap



rachel clean the blood from VOGELs face
he have he eye
close

thank you
she tear off a new strip of tape and place it over
VOGELs mouth gently
she notice the rain leak in through the ceiling and
walk off towards the kitchen
we hold on vogel apparently
sleep
then he tie hand reach out strain and
manage to reach one of the of break bowl

rachel gather three
she stop for a moment looking at flashing in the
sky
she remember it be new year eve
we with she as she walk into the live room and
begin to place the pot on the floor to catch the
rainwater which be dripping through various point in the
ceiling

as he use the shard to saw through he rope




as she finish with the pot and notice the piece of
shatter bowl scattered around vogel
she kneel down in
front of he and collect up the piece
she glance up at
vogel checking he
he be still slump eye closed
we with she as she walk back into the kitchen
from
the live room come the three distinct of rainwater
dripping in the pot
she drop the piece of bowl into the bin and stop
puzzle
it be a moment before she work out what she be
notice something have changed in the sound of the
rainwater next door
there only two drip instead of three
she walk back towards the live room


through the live room door we can see
that one of the pot have be overturned
rachel slow to a
stop
sudden wave of adrenalin cause she to turn
but
it be too late
vogel step out of the alcove he be
be standing in so that he be directly in front of she
before she can even cry out he have slashed she face open
with a
instinctively she cup she hand to she rip face
vogel
grab she by the hair and step behind she try to
worm he other hand underneath she raise arm to reach she
throat with the glass
she train kicking in rachel use a krav magah move to
grab and twist Vogels forearm breaking he hold on she
and turning the arm until with a yell of pain vogel drop
the shard
he swing wildly at she but rachel duck the
fist and drive the palm of she hand up into he face
vogel stumble back surprise by she speed and the sudden
pain of the blow
rachel be about to press home the attack but be blinded by
blood from she wound washing into she eye
as she wipe she eye clear vogel grab a from a
small chest of drawer in the hall and smash it into she
face
she fall
vogel begin to run but driven by adrenaline and
desperation rachel scramble onto all fours and lunge at
he catching hold of he trousers leg as he move towards
the front door
vogel stumble manage to pull a leg free and stamp down
on rachel who let we go with a moan
he stamp again step
free and kick she hard in the head
rachel roll with the force of the kick and come to a
rest losing consciousness


flutter in and out of
darkness Vogels foot as he stand beside we breathing
hard
then he turn and hurry to the front door
and
out




vogel hurry along the walkway and set off down the
spiral staircase of the apartment build



rachel lie motionless
we wait for she to cough as we see
she do before
but she do not
she just continue to lie
still


below we vogel clatter on down the stairs flight after
flight


no movement from rachel


vogel clear the stairs and burst into the courtyard
there be a lurid flash of firework from nearby and for a
moment we see vogel light as he pass the point where
early we see he drop to the ground
he reach the gate and go through he shadow
disappearing on the pavement
he be go



rachel hold a bloodsoaked tea towel to she cheek trying
to staunch the flow
david sit stare ahead in shock

silently but all the time there be a terrible tension
about she movement
she try to close a drawer but it stick she keep
trying then in a sudden rush of fury yank the drawer free
and hurl it across the room
she stand breathing hard

hand as if to reassure she a ghastly attempt at
reasonableness

the road at the back of the hospital
the music continue as we with rachel stare
steadily ahead walking slowly down the long road she coat
pulled around she
in the distance framed between the arch she abandoned
car
blood begin to spot the ground behind she



we be in darkness
then a open ahead of we and
slide to one side revealing an oval of brilliant white
light
slowly we towards the harsh light

walking on towards she car





we be at the top of an which lead down
to the runway below and two line of waiting
applaud

walk on a small lone figure against the white of the
snow


the three begin they descent down the stairs
towards the

tiny framed within the two arch
still moving towards
the car


we on young rachel as she blink against the harsh
sunlight take out a pair of sunglass and slip they on
then she step forward to accept she reward
