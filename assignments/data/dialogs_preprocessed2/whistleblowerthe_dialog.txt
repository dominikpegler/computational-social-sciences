okay i be going to be talking about crime
scene investigation today
if we could

where do we sign to say we come

actually you sign the attendance at the
end of the session
it be a mandate

or we sign now

we sign later




keeping the crime scene clean be
number one


we sign sheet now

you will tell we be cooperate

we have to go to the hospital together



we get here as quick as we could

just try to get they here on time




seem we have two stabbing one
shoot and a man with a break leg and
a bad hangover who can not remember what
happen
average night back in
brighton

facial contusion from
repeat beating with fist
laceration on the eye cause by the
edge of an iron

the right hand be the first entry point
of a large kitchen knife
the second
entry point in the upper leave thigh
it go through she hand and into she
leg
who be going to take this report

anyone


i will take it

Tze you yiyiy vuna

what do he say

she be muslim
he said she deserved it

alright that be it
everyone out

be not she filing a
complaint



she have to file a complaint
woman get
stabbed in the face and there be no
repercussion

quit it
you hear i

we be not investigator
we be
monitor
you do not know a serb from a
croat or a Bosniak
you have get ethnic
hatred that start a war
this be not
just policing it be diplomacy


we do not run the show we make sure the
show run smoothly



come out
you can not solve this tonight
i be not taking no for an answer









Zlata Sehik have be to the hospital
eight time because of she husband
every
time she try to file a complaint i
boss send she back
they always laugh
at the woman
they laugh at i
mother
they do not make prosecution of
domestic violence
i want to get enough
evidence to do this

this be why you be here no


with no police report
maybe if you
go back to the hospital
you can pull
the record for every one of she visit





okay now get the same thing from all the
doctor who treated she
they will have
to testify on Zlatas behalf



this be good
let we cross reference each
injury with other case where felony
assault be ruled
can you get
something like that

because if stab someone in a bar
be illegal then the same standard can be
applied to a domestic assault





if an attorney present this properly
reference international standard you
might be able to get a conviction

brian

than thailand for girl

the soldier from italia say i be his

mom be you okay

yeah
i just be think about you

okay can i go back to bed now

yeah
of course i just
it be great to
hear you voice



how be thing

busy
i follow up on the florida bar
it be bad than i think
there be a
protection racket

american
romanian be taking payoff to make
sure the place be not busted
that raid
be a punishment bust because the owner
stopped paying
but he must have settled it
because the girl be right back where
they start
lock up in the hill

i talk to thirty five girl at the
shelter
all this testimony can not be
ignore
we guy be patronizing the
bar in large number
rick serious
abuse be taking place
it be all in i
report

okay let we back up a second here


i have get two girl ready to testify about
taking payoff

testify where

in court

bosnian court
not going to happen
all
international personnel have immunity

i know
but there must be some channel
some exception

look you have do really good work here
these be serious allegation
let i
look into how to handle it
i will get back
to you





it be different for we
we be all military
or police
every contingent except for
the you

if someone do something
wrong they have to answer to a military
tribunal at home
with the american
you Dyncorp guy
i do not think you have
that

so the american be not legally
accountable for anything

to be honest i think we superior would
keep it quiet too
i mean i have not see
a military tribunal


you know i mission stay be up in a few
week
you could come home with i

to do what

i be just
this place know it get
to you
i be i be worry what will happen
to you a year from now

you do not need to worry about i

someone do

so fred murray could just walk up to a
man and shoot he in daylight and he would
never see the inside of a courtroom

in bosnia yes
but
i mean
something that public could get he send
home
and tried in he own country



helen love it here
i think she have
olympic ambition


i wanted these girl to testify in a
trial against the officer
but

the immunity problem

okay but if the girl testify in a
bosnian court against they trafficker
Tanjo
they would have to mention what else
go on in the brothel

it could work
if you make certain that
in they testimony they mention every
sordid detail of involvement

that be they testimony
then it would be
on record
somebody would have to pay
attention
like
the state department

they be going to answer for this





and the two girl have to go to the
hospital to get immunize or they can not
stay in the country
i need an armored
security vehicle

you be lucky you have a car at all
we be
stretched to the limit
besides be not
this a local police matter
