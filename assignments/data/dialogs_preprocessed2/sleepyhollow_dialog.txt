of dream that wave before the half shut eye
sleepy hollow new york
new york city

where be you
o
s

over here

i need you help with this

constable crane
ichabod crane
be that you

yes it be i
but not only i
i find someone here

someone quite dead

burn it

yes sir

just a moment
if i may
it be
possible this man be murdered

he drown
anyone could see

there be surgical way of telling
how he die
by the water in his
lung

he will be burned pursuant to
statute of health

i could determine if he be dead
before
he go into the hudson

must we again hear these heretical
ranting

yes must we

there be nothing heretical about
science sir
the chinese have
written on it for hundreds of
year
procedural study used to
solve seemingly unsolvable crime

we first night watch be adequate
against fire and some violence
but if we be more often able to
ensure justice after the fact
then criminal would truly have
something to fear from law
enforcement

have they nothing to fear presently

without disrespect look around you
we overflow
as do we court

and
with
disrespect constable
if jail and court overflow it be
testimony to success not failure

but how many innocent rot here
and how many victim be buried
without reprisal while guilty man
roam we street

very few if any

even though i have see confession
pry from the lip of the accuse
often quite literally

for one who call himself a
federalist you mouth reek of
republican liberalism

not liberalism
equanimity

um sir
might i suggest

there be a farm community
upstate constable

hollow

and so you take
you experimentations to sleepy
hollow and catch the murderer who
have tainted the place
bring he
here to face we good justice
will you do this for i

v
o

he be infamous for taking he
horse daredevil hard into
battle

full gallop
v
o

just to look on he make you
blood run cold for he have file
down he tooth to rapier
to
add to the ferocity of he
appearance
v
o

he would not finally meet he end

henry clinton and washington

it be
between those two place not far
from here

cut off he head with he own sword
it be a legend tell for twenty year

but only recently have the headless
hessian be see prowl the
hollow in search of a head to suit
he shoulder

just a moment
be you saying it be he

when a goblin leap from the nether
world other follow
poltergeist
of the air water and earth follow
and cheer he desecration

no one know why he choose to now to
climb out from he grave

it be very clear why
citizen
here have long tried to hide sin
behind close door
they fail
faith have saturated the soil and
called forth one of Satans own

excuse i gentleman but
who
have see this horseman

many have

then name one person who have see
he with they own eye

while i will do everything i can
to find you assassin i will look

the air so that dream come to
everyone
accord to the elder
an indian prophet held powwows here
before the land be taken and
spell cast then still linger to
this day

do you often make a habit of
sitting on strange man bed

you be horribly oldfashion
be not you

feel free to form you own opinion
though it appear you already have

well i intended to apologize for
the behavior of i friend brom van
brunt but it seem i have make
matter bad
i will leave you to you business

excuse i
i should apologize
i
um
i
have no great love of

other people

small talk

it might have be more
might have
be positively grand talk

be it i or be you this nervous
around all woman

perhaps it be because you suitor
hand be recently very nearly
wrapped around i throat

i suitor

the massive fellow
brom
for
someone you call friend he
misplace a good portion of jealousy

he have proposed to i twice

which may explain he temperament
to have ask twice mean the answer
be no at least once

i have read a great deal about you
new york city
do be a dear and tell
i all about it
sound like an
extraordinary place to live a life

extra ordinary yes
but first you
tell i about the headless horseman

come out devil
come

not all think it be the horseman
many say witch come from the
western wood to steal skull for
they cauldron
some believe a
person in this very town kneel
before lucifer offering death as
tribute
and still other believe
none of it

be you so superstitious

to call a person superstitious be to
imply they fear magic but not all
magic be black

there be no such thing as magic

really
then
what be you
rebuttal to those romantic poet
claiming proof of magic in a rose at
full bloom or even in a teardrop

poet have silly notion about
plant and bodily secretion

you be funny

constable where be you going

come back sir
madness



closing in on jonathan

the van Garretts die first
a man
and he son survive by a wife and
two infant
and the widow windsor
be next

and now jonathan Masbath

why would he flee this direction
with so much open ground to cross
before he reach cover

he would not have go into the
western wood
no sane man would

van ripper there

find the body this morning
you do believe now do not you

believe

you said yourself
what mere man
could have down the belltower

it be a prime tenet of science
Philipse that because one thing
appear improbable do not mean
you embrace the utterly fantastical

you need less big word and more
common sense

what be that you wear

i talisman
it will protect
against the horseman if i show a
brave face
but i cannot run
if
i run in fear it be worthless

well
so much for common sense

be this jonathans

yes
seem he panicked across here
and broke two leg

who take the meat

must have be the redman
Lenape
indian live in the western wood

these wood of yours sound a bit
crowded what with all the witch
ghoul and indian living there

there be only one Lenape
he eat
small animal and lose child
and the occasional constable when he
can get it

why do you move the body doctor

to place it inside it coffin

what the hell be you do

you be the blacksmith
ever shod
a horse with a hoof this large

never
shoe that size i would
have remember

van ripper
can you show where the
body lay

i can show exactly

here
in front of this oak facing
north
horrible

to the good of you recollection
where do the open wound fall

there be not much blood be there

i do not see none

no bleed

what be that

this should have bleed by the pint
yet no blistering or scorched flesh
how

whatever weapon be used
it cauterize somehow

it instantly burn the wound shut

i be not here for revenge
i be
here to bring justice

whatever
you still need a second
to tend to you thing

i manage fine alone

i deserve to help you
do not you see
how much this means
i father
he
he be a good man

young Masbath i be sorry for you

however
i cannot be the one to
look after you now

i do not ask you to do i

hail constable
how be you

well enough
you gather do
honor to the deceased

we must be a curious sight to he

what be you spying on

the Lenape
he come to gawk at
civilization from time to time
o
s

do you see the Redskinned bastard

he be a behemoth

diseased monster

if you gentleman will excuse the
doctor and i
we have financial
matter to discuss

home and good land

find yourself a place in the servant
residence and wake i before dawn
we first task will be an unsavory one

it be sacrilege

i cannot proceed without examining
the previous victim

magistrate Philipse surely you can
stop this

i will not allow it
i will not

protest to i superior if you like

you superior be two day away

we must discover it
the reason the
murderer choose these person

the wound be the same

cage
the point be

you make this and the drawing

the eye retain
each image till they combine
and
yet some would call this toy magic

do not you see why
look closely a
moment

can not you see what be inexplicable

oh you be hopeless
may i keep
it at least

true magic which even you will not
be able to deny

thank you

here

i insist that you have it

very well
but it will only sit
gather dust

that would be a pity
those word
might show you something you have never
see before

not more than a year ago a mob hung
a man for stealing a horse
for
stealing a horse
and you dig up
we dead

be you saying i should be frighten
be this a message passed on from
clergyman Steenwyck

banker or even constable
every
penny we earn come from what we
send down the hudson

i know it

um

worker flee for they live
there
be a danger that we crop will rot
so if you be going to help we you
stop the horseman

a monster what good be i

for poaching
or would you remake
we law now that magistrate Philipse
have given up the ghost

do that look like an animal hanging

look like an indian

wait
give i a moment

the Lenape indian have much to tell
once i opened he mouth

how could he

he tooth
someone have cut they and
chipped off rotten piece far back
in he mouth
the Lenape could not
have do that for himself
someone out there care for he

where be we going

up

what be it

it be payment day
loan mony be
given to Baltus the last day each
month
almost everyone borrow
for tool or to hire worker

out there
what do you see

the western wood

look again

smoke
chimney smoke

be you familiar with magnet

what kind of nut

not for eating i assure you
watch
here

it be spectacular

yes
i suppose it be
keep it

no i could not

i have other
all i need be this

thank you

now hold the bowl steady
back to
business

if the western wood be truly the
devil glen we will see for
ourselves

father said witch live there

witch do not exist
however

not long ago i would have say the
same for headless horseman
o
s

constable


i need to speak with you
alone

why would you do such a thing

no stone may be left unturned
it
may appear harsh

i have misjudge you i think
i do
not imagine you be so cruel

you be not regard it in full
the widow windsor have be run
through by a sword
i follow the
bloodless wound a wound whose path
i could not comprehend till i have
see the horseman with i own eye

what be you on about

the child she carry be eight
month grow at least
near to
birth
the sword have pierced it
tiny heart exactly

must i hear this

there be no blind stab
this
singular thrust find it target
omnipotently as if the horseman make
certain the unborn child die with
it mother

and this give worth to butchery

it be not butchery

what be it then
scientific method
how can any of this matter in the
slight

i have no solution for it meaning
yet but i could not just ignore it

take a lesson from young Masbaths
desire ichabod crane
he follow
with you to avenge he father death
that i understand
but what do you
want

to avenge he father and the other

but why
tell i why

you falter with you answer because
you strive without putting the whole
of you heart into it
can not you see
you will bring dignity to the dead even
if you have to chop they into little
piece to do it

if it have be surgery on a live
person do to save that persona
life you would not question it
not
for a moment
so let i be the first
to tell you dear girl
on the other
side of these shelter mountain a
whole world have advanced beyond such
plebeian think as yours
and
someday no matter how much you fear
it that world will come to roust
sleepy hollow out of it slumber

what be it

listen

i hear nothing

no cricket or cicada calling
no
bird song

we have apparently arrive

pardon
you do not answer when i
knock
be we intrude

you be from the hollow

in a way yes

the Lenape who live in these wood
do you know he
the redman
i should tell you
he have be
murdered

leave i
you be not welcome here

be you a friend to the indian
you should have this
if you be
he friend

you seek remedy against the horseman

go out and keep away child
you stay
follow with i

i hear he
he ride to the hollow
and back

the horseman
yes

sit

can you help

you want to see into the nether world
i can show you
whatever you see do
not move or speak
i will hold he

what
what be you do

close you mouth
keep silent

he come now

excuse i
um

be you alright


you seek the warrior bathe in
blood
the headless horseman

follow the indian trail to where the
sun die
follow to the tree of the
dead

climb down to the Horsemans soulless
place and let loose he silent
shrieking
do you hear
do you hear

he who hold fast the Horsemans
desire will guide he reaping hand
catch hold of he desire

we be leaving

what happen

follow the indian trail to where the
sun die
to the tree of the dead
maybe we passed it by

how could something named the tree
of the dead fail to draw attention

we should not go much **further/far in
this murk

should we go back

we be far from the hollow
loath to say it
well to get we
back against a tree and stay till
morning

what do it mean
climb down to
the Horsemans soulless place

let loose he silent shrieking

who know till we work at it
i
admit not be anxious to find out
he who hold the Horsemans desire
will guide he reaping hand

whatever the Horsemans desire be
other than extinguishing live

do not move



low to the ground

what godforsaken hell be this

christ

you all stand idle while this man
go about with a book of secret and
a bag filled with magic
you all
stand idle while the shadow of the
devil fall over we town

i say if you do nothing you share
in the blasphemy of ichabod crane

listen to i
do you want to save
you crop
or would you rather see
you farm go to ruin

how be he saving we farm
how
ichabod crane have bring into we
midst the soulless moldering corpse
of a heretic

the wound be neither smooth nor
cauterize but jagged
she bleed
like a fountain

she do not go quietly

step aside constable
step aside

what be you do

let she burn
let she burn

stop this
leave they alone

let they go
be you going to beat an orphane
child imbecile

be you ichabod crane protector
brom bone

only for the moment

you side with he in this

no
i agree he have only make matter
badly
but that will change if you
listen

theodore glenn and i offer to ride
each day and night to watch over the
hollow
we will stalk the border of
the western wood and haunt the
horseman for a change with rifle
like this
and slug like this

hollow out and filled with powder

constable crane be not the only one
who fight with science on he side

i fired upon the horseman and the
bullet do nothing

you must have missed you mark

i hit he square

i say
if the horseman be solid
enough to take the live of we
people he be solid enough to feel
this
v
o

the night of the great storm i see
she cross i window

in the lightning i do see she
