toby what movie could possibly be
worth drivin mile round trip
for

it be a new film called revenge of
the nerd
it be about a group of
nerd college student who be be
pick on all the time by the jock
so they decide to take revenge
i
already see it once

wow you really dig this movie

i like it a lot harvey

what be these nerd like
how would
you describe they

hmm
nerd be smart but they look
and act differently than other people
like nerd might wear polyester button
down shirt and flood pants where
they ankle and they sock be
showing

so what you sayin be you identify
with those nerd

yes i consider myself a nerd
and
this movie have uplift i
there be
this one scene where a nerd grab
the microphone during a pep rally
and announce that he be a nerd and
that he be proud of it and stand up
for the right of other nerd
then
he ask the kid at the pep rally
who think they be nerd to come
forward
so nearly everyone in the
place do
that be the way the movie
end

so the nerd win huh

yes

wow
you get this movie an i be
gettin hitch
we both have a good
month huh

finishing he last
burger
right
harvey how long be you going
to be in delaware because i would really
like to see this movie with you

i be only going for a week but then
i will have a wife so i will have to
take she along
be it a girl flick

depend on the girl
what kind of
girl be you new bride
be she a
nerd

i do not know man
maybe
she be into
herbal tea


i agree with toby
i think it be a
story of hope and tolerance

yes
it be about time that the people
who get pick on get to be the
hero

it be an entertain flick an i can
see why you like it toby but those
people on the screen be not even
suppose to be you
they be college
student whose parent live in big
house in the suburb
they be going to
get degree get good job and stop
be nerd

harvey what do i say about loud
talking
use you inside voice

look toby the guy in that movie
be not yearold file clerk who
live with they grandmother in an
ethnic ghetto

that be enough harvey

they do not get they computer like
you do by trade in a bunch of
box top and
at the
supermarket

you be funny harvey

sure toby
go to the movie and
daydream but revenge of the nerd
be not reality
it be just hollywood
bullshit





okay maybe i be bein so harsh on
toby onna count a i own problem

see i be not even marry a month
and i old lady be already showin
sign a trouble
grant i tend ta
get marry fast because i will take
any woman that have i but this
time i really meet i match


okay i think the thing with joyce
be that as manic as harvey can be
she match he with depression
in
that way they complete each other
i
mean she be obviously a very smart
woman but she have a lot of trouble
functioning in a world she can not
control
and she be totally obsess
with all thing negative
know
disease dysfuctions etc

collector

harvey

when i die will adat character keep

or will he just fade away

Omigod harvey
harvey wake up

i name be harvey Pekar
it be an
unusual name harvey Pekar

be the year i get i first
apartment and i first telephone
book
imagine i surprise when i
look up i name and see that in
addition to i another harvey Pekar
be listed

i be listed as harvey
Pekar
i middle name be lawrence
he be
listed as harvey Pekar no middle
initial
therefore his be a pure
listing

then in the seventies i notice
that a third harvey Pekar be listed
in the phone book
this filled i
with curiosity

how could there be three people with
such an unusual name in the world
let alone in one city

then one day a person i worked with
expressed she sympathy to i
concerning what she think be the
death of i father
she pointed out
an obituary notice in the newspaper
for a man named harvey Pekar
one of
he son be named harvey
these
be the other harvey Pekars

six month later harvey Pekar jr
die
although i would meet neither man
i be filled with sadness
what
be they like i think
it seem
that we live have be linked in
some indefinable way

but the story do not end there
for two year later another harvey
Pekar appear in the directory
what kind of people be these
where
do they come from what do they do
what be in a name

who be harvey Pekar



here we man a year later
somehow
i make it through the treatment
an the doctor be optimistic
i
guess joyce be right about do
the big comic book
we published the
thing as a graphic novel we first
collaboration and end up with
rave review
we even win the american
book award
go figure


hey joyce

what be it harvey

that be the doctor

he said i be all clear

i illness be danielle
with she
real mother runnin around who know
where an seein how well she and
joyce get on fred decided she would
have a good life with we
