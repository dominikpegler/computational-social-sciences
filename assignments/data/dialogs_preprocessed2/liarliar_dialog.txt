and you dad

i dad
he be


a liar


liar
i do not think you
mean a liar


well
he wear a suit and
go to court and talk to the
judge and


oh
i see you mean he be a
lawyer
max shrug



early s stand before the
he
manner be utterly genuine and convince

dark street


a stormy
night
two desperate man
struggle
one man be taken
to the hospital the other to
ja il
the prosecutor want
you to believe this be an
openandshut case of a poor
man brutally victimize
he nod at the victim a fragile in he s

well for once i agree with
t he prosecutor
this be an
openand shut case but the
true victim be i client
fletchers be a pound brute in a suit

put yourself in he shoe for
a momentwalking home from
church alone in a
frighten part of the
suburb
as he describe he client movement fletcher


you be nervous timid looking
over you shoulder when
suddenly you encounter he
pointing at the
old man
pounce from the shadow
you quiver in fear
the
streetlight flash on
something shiny in he hand
a knife

and in that terrifying instant
you do what any respectable
citizen would you defend
y ou rse lf
only after you
shatter he arm and collarbone
do you realize it be all a
mistake
the man be merely
walking away from an
machine the apparent flash of
metal cause by he bank card

as you stand over his
crumple though potentially
stilldangerous form you
he art go out to he
you
want to help
first you
gather up the many bill he
drop to stop they from
bl owi ng away
second in an
effort to get the name and
number of someone to notify
you take he wallet
finally
you leap into the mane lexus
to head for assistance when
suddenly a police car speed
up
you breathe a sigh of
relief
someone to look after
the injure man
oh joy

but do the police applaud you
initiative
do they hail you
heroism
no they arrest you
and throw you in the slammer

and why
why do the state
turn it massive power against
this individual
take an

moment then
answer he own


discrimination
to a black

but this time it be not base
on race
to a female

not base on gender
to a man wearing
a crucifix
not base on religion
to a heavy set

Nothis time it be
discrimination base on size
i know what the prosecution
want you to think i t s
always the big guy fault
be that what we have come to as
a society persecute
people because they be large

shame on you mister
prosecutor
shame on you
turning back to

the state be trying to
barbeque i client on the spit
of justice
only you can douse
the flame
the decision be
you s
and please
do not let
you emotion run away with
y ou
the fact that i client
be a family man raising he
son alone after the tragic
death of they mother have
absolutely no bear on this
case

instead let cold reason be
you guide as you decide the
fate of this churchgo
orphanrasing widower

all rise for the honorable
judge william stevens

counsel

fine thank you

and you mr
reid

well i be a little upset about
a bad sexual episode i have
last night

well you be still young
it will happen more and more
in the meantime what do you
say we get
down to business
first mr
reid i see that
you client be previously
represent by mr
rand of
you office

yes you honor

i take it you be seeking to
substitute in as counsel

yes you honor

fine fine
and for the
record the reason be

mr
rand have severe ethical
objection to i client
case

i take it you do not share the
same ethical objection mr
reid

i have low standard you
honor

i see
well if mrs
cole
want the substitution of
counsel i will allow it
be
that what you want mrs
cole

yes

fine

aside to

what be you do

i do not know
to judge with


you honor i d like a
continuance

this case have already be
delayed several time mr
reid

i realize that you honor
but i d really really really
like a continuance

i will have to hear good because
counselor
what be the
problem

i can not lie

commendable mr
reid but i be
still waiting for the good
caus e
now do you have it or
not

not

motion for a continuance
denied
be there any chance
of a settlement in this case

i do not think so you honor
mr
reid make it abundantly
clear that the last thing in
the world he wanted be to





there appear to have be a
change in strategy
let we go
to i chamber and negotiate

you honor under the term of
the prenuptual agreement if
mrs
cole commit adultery
she be entitled to nothing
we have in we possession an
audiotape make by a license
private investigator of an
explicit act of sexual
congress with a man who be not
she husband

sound pretty damn mr
reid

it certainly do

however i client have no
desire to see he exwife
destitute
against i advice
he be will to offer she a
cash settlement of
two point
four million dollar

two four seem like a pretty
fair offer mr
reid

fantastically fair
Phenominally fair
in fact
i would say beyond fair bordering
on stupid

what be you suggest mr
rei d
that ms
Appletons
willingness to proffer such an
offer betray a lack of faith
in she position

no not at all
she be get i
client dead to right
when
attorney go to sleep at
night they dream of have a
case as strong as hers

can the sarcasm reid
all
right i admit it i have see
you make even the lame case
fly
but this time i have
you
even clarence darrow
could not explain this away

wel l mr
reid
without a
dynamite explanation i would say
you be dead in the water
how be you client story

the good that money can buy
o you r honor

strong corroborate evidence

we have evidence that you be
not going tobelieve

you be pretty confident how
this trial be going to come
out eh mr
reid


confident be too weak a
word you honor
i be
certain what will happen if i
take this puppy to trial
the
verdict will be a stun
humiliating defeat that will
cut a spectacularly promise
legal career off at the knee

all right
double the offer
four point eight
and not a
penny more
venomous to

bastard

you be some negotiator mr
reid
if you client have half
a brain she will jump at the
offer


no

no

mrs
cole this offer
be a miracle
i be talking
about a walkingonwater
Lazarusrisingfromthedead

miracle
you have go from
two point four to four point
eight million in
check his

four minute
think of it
this way now you be get
paid seven hundred thou per
schtupp

mr
reid you convinced i
yesterday i be the victim
here starved for affection
driven into the arm of
another man

seven

seven other man
with the

of the associate you
rudeness to the staff and the
fact that you work suck i
would

an immature need for sexual
conquest
