
by
final production draft



we hear



you know the problem with
hollywood
they make shit
unbelievable unremarkable shit
i be not some grungy filmmaker
wannabee searching for
existentialism through a haze of
bongsmoke
it be easy to pick
apart bad acting shortsighted
directing or the purely moronic
string together of word many
of the studio term as prose
no
i be talking the lack of realism
realism
not a pervasive element
in the modern american cinematic
vision



three man sit at a window booth drink coffee and
talking
two of the man sit on one side of the table
be in he early thirties early
forties
both wear suit the young be fairly
expensive and well cut the other be polyester enough
said
the across however be quite different
he
be what they used to call a coolcat


take dog day afternoon for
example
arguably Pacinos
great performance except
the godfather part i and
scarface of course

masterpiece of directing easily
Lumets best
the act the
script cinematography all top
notch
but they do not push the
envelope
what if in dog day
sonny really wanted to get away
with it
what if and here
where it get tricky
what if
they would start killing hostage
no mercy no quarter meet we
demand or the cute blonde in the
bell bottom get one in the back
of the head bam splatter
what
still no bus




how many innocent victim would
they let get sprayed across the
window before the city reversed
it policy on hostage situation
and this be
no


no




no


no internet
fast forward to the present same
situation
can you imagine the
feed frenzy of the modern
media
in hour it would be the
top story from boston to budapest
all caught in millimeter zoom
computer enhance and color
correct
you would practically
taste the brain matter
six
hostage die
ten
twelve
twenty
thirty
relentless
one
after another
all over a bus a
plane and a couple of million
dollar that be federally
insured
he sit letting the picture sink in then

just a thought
i mean it be not
really within the realm of
conventional cinema but what
if

you know this movie of yours i
do not think it would have work

really
how come

audience love happy ending

pacino escape
with the money
boyfriend get the sex change
operation
they live happily ever
after
stanley shake he head

no




no

homophobia
stanley shake he head

bad guy can not win
it be a
morality tale
one way or the
other he be get to go down

oh well
life do tend to be
stranger than fiction
well guy get to jet
this place
be kinda dead
the coffee shop
not a soul in the
place
we the
front door which be open
outside the open doorway be
crouched a squad of heavily bodyarmored member
packed together and aim automatic weapon inside


thanks for the coffee
he get up
in he leave hand which have be hidden by
the table until now he be holding a strangelooking
springloaded grip
gabriel be looking back at they
smile

rene descartes be sitting in some
bar in paris
bartender say
hey you want another drink

descartes say i think not

and disappear
he smile at he own joke then turn and walk over to
the front door

move
no one even twitch

i will not ask again



he lift up the device in he leave hand

who nod he head
the team move back letting
gabriel out of the coffee shop

thank you
gabriel look back at stan sitting in the booth

stanley
you coming
stan slide from the booth as gabriel exit the coffee
shop


no sound on the
gabriel and stanley stop just outside the doorway
gabriel don a pair of hip little shade then continue
across the sidewalk and into the street
he nonchalantly look up
suddenly the of
and the of dominate the
soundtrack
pandemonium
the sky

a bunch of news vulture
squad car block off both end
of the street while truck news van and looky
loo be packed together into the distance
sharpshooter lean out of window and sniper be
position on every open rooftop
hundreds of weapon
be pointed at this man who saunter across the street as
if he be on he way to sunday service without a care in
the world
slowly stanley follow gabriel into the street
gabriel step up on the far sidewalk a huge armored bus
block most of the window
he walk beside the bus
under a huge sign and through the glass
front door which shut


he turn away from the window and we he

red ferrari

plate steel

cabletied behind they back

taped around they chest and each be wearing what
appear to be a dog collar
the other occupant of the room be nine man
all of

event of the year be it not for the automatic weapon
each one carry

young normally goodlookingbutnowcoveredinmascara
whimper blonde girl

such grief she can not even walk


on the sidewalk the suited man he automatic weapon
sling hold she up for everyone to see

into a hightech command center reading a newspaper

in the basement and through a file
room be the only


still
active and on the internet
although only a few people know
this
it be an i


machine and
keep online just for historical
sake
i hide i worm inside it
where no one would ever think to
look




now i just have to modify the
code

he be fucking amazing

yes he be

you would tell i exactly what the
hydra be going to be used for



have you hear of operation
swordfish

nope



you will appreciate the irony
here

in the early eighties the



set up a network of dummy
corporation as a government front
to launder drug money and gather
evidence
problem be the front
company start making money
lots of money
by when
operation swordfish be
terminated there be close to
million dollar in the


s
account






money that just sorta disappeared

it do not disappear
it just sit
in those account earn interest
it be be year
you have any
concept how much money we would be
actually talking about today
billions brother
that be nine
zeros
look this be a sweet deal
we
go in over phone line
pop the
firewall drop in the hydra and
just sit back and wait for the
money

before we can tap into the secure
cluster you have to find one of
the bank on the backbone of this
network
do you know how many
bank there be in the you

it
could take year
