i have be walking by you side for a long
time

that i know

be you prepare

i body be frighten but i be not

well there be no shame in that

wait a moment

that be what they all say
i grant no reprieve

you play chess do not you

how do you know that

i have see it in painting and hear it sung
in ballad

yes in fact i be quite a good chess player

but you can not be good than i be

why do you want to play chess with i

i have i reason

that be you privilege

the condition be that i may live as long as i
hold out against you
if i win you will
release i
be it agreed

you draw black

very appropriate
do not you think so

between a strumpet leg to lie
be the life for which i sigh

up above be god almighty
so very far away
but you brother the devil
you will meet on every level

in Frjestad everyone be talking about evil
omen and other horrible thing
two horse have
eat each other in the night and in the
churchyard grave have be open and the
remain of corpse scattered all over the
place
yesterday afternoon there be as many
as four sun in the heaven

well do he show you the way

not exactly

what do he say

nothing

be he a mute

no sir i would not say that
as a matter of
fact he be quite eloquent

oh

he be eloquent all right
the trouble be that
what he have to say be most depressing
one moment you be bright and lively
the next you be crawling with worm
fate be a terrible villain
and you i friend it poor victim

must you sing

no

good morning
have you have breakfast
i can not
eat grass bad luck
can not you teach i how
we be a little hard up
people be not very
interest in juggling in this part of the
country

mia wake up
wake up
mia i have just see
something
i have get to tell you about it

what be it
what be happen

listen i have have a vision
no it be not a
vision
it be real absolutely real

oh so you have have a vision again

but i do see she

whom do you see

the virgin mary

do you really see she

she be so close to i that i could have
touched she
she have a golden crown on she head
and wear a blue gown with flower of gold
she
be barefoot and have small brown hand with
which she be holding the child and teach
he to walk
and then she see i watch she
and she smile at i
i eye filled with tear
and when i wipe they away she have disappeared
and everything become so still in the sky and
on the earth
can you understand

what an imagination you have

you do not believe i
but it be real i tell
you not the kind of reality you see every day
but a different kind

perhaps it be the kind of reality you told we
about when you see the devil paint we wagon
wheel red use he tail as a brush

why must you keep bringing that up

and then you discovered that you have red paint
under you nail

well perhaps that time i make it up
i do it just so that you would believe in i
other vision
the real one
the one that i
do not make up

you have to keep you vision under control
otherwise people will think that you be a
halfwit which you be not
at least not yet
as far as i know
but come to think of it i be
not so sure about that

i do not ask to have vision
i can not help it
if voice speak to i if the holy virgin
appear before i and angel and devil like i
company

have not i told you once and for all that i need
i morning sleep
i have ask you politely
plead with you but nothing work
so now i be
telling you to shut up

if we would only get some rain
everything be
burned to cinder
we will not have anything to
eat this winter

we will get by

i want mikael to have a good life than ours

mikael will grow up to be a great acrobat or
a juggler who can do the one impossible trick

what be that

to make one of the ball stand absolutely still
in the air

but that be impossible

impossible for we but not for he

you be dreaming again

i have composed a song
i make it up during the
night when i could not sleep
do you want to
hear it

sing it
i be very curious

i have to sit up first

on a lily branch a dove be perched
against the summer sky
she sing a wondrous song of christ
and there be great joy on high

mia
be you asleep

it be a lovely song

i have not finished yet

i hear it but i think i will sleep a little
longer
you can sing the rest to i afterwards

all you do be sleep

be this suppose to be a mask for an actor
if
the priest do not pay we so well i would say no
thank you

be you going to play death

just think scaring decent folk out of they
wit with this kind of nonsense

when be we suppose to do this play

at the saint feast in elsinore
we be going
to perform right on the church step believe
it or not

would not it be good to play something bawdy
people like it good and besides it be more
fun

idiot
there be a rumor going around that
there be a terrible pestilence in the land and
now the priest be prophesy sudden death
and all sort of spiritual agony

and what part be i to play

you be such a damn fool so you be going to be
the soul of man

that be a bad part of course

who make the decision around here
who be the
director of this company anyhow

bear this in mind you fool
you life hang by
a thread
you time be short
be the woman going to like i in this getup
will i make a hit
no
i feel as if i be dead
already

Jof

what be it

sit still
do not move

what do you mean

do not say anything

i be as silent as a grave

shh
i love you

what be this suppose to represent

the dance of death

and that one be death

yes he dance off with all of they

why do you paint such nonsense

i think it would serve to remind people that
they must die

well it be not going to make they feel any
happy

why should one always make people happy
it
might not be a bad idea to scare they a little
once in a while

then they will close they eye and refuse to
look at you paint

oh they will look
skull be almost more
interesting than a naked woman

if you do scare they

they will think

and if they think

they will become still more scare

and then they will run right into the arm of the
priest

that be not i business

you be only paint you dance of death

i be only paint thing as they be
everyone
else can do as he like

just think how some people will curse you

maybe
but then i will paint something amuse
for they to look at
i have to make a live
at least until the plague take i

the plague
that sound horrible

you should see the boil on a diseased mane
throat
you should see how he body shrivel up
so that he leg look like knot string
like the man i have painted over there

that look terrible

it certainly do
he try to rip out the
boil he bite he hand tear he vein open
with he fingernail and he scream can be
hear everywhere
do that scare you

scare
i
you do not know i
what be the
horror you have painted over there

the remarkable thing be that the poor creature
think the pestilence be the lords punishment
mob of people who call themselves slave of
sin be swarm over the country flagellate
themselves and other all for the glory of god

do they really whip themselves

yes it be a terrible sight
i crawl into a
ditch and hide when they pass by

do you have any brandy
i have be drink
water all day and it be make i as thirsty as a
camel in the desert

i think i frighten you after all

i want to talk to you as openly as i can but
i heart be empty

the emptiness be a mirror turned towards i
own face
i see myself in it and i be filled
with fear and disgust

through i indifference to i fellow man i
have isolated myself from they company
now i
live in a world of phantom
i be imprisoned in
i dream and fantasy

and yet you do not want to die

yes i do

what be you waiting for

i want knowledge

you want guarantee

call it whatever you like
be it so cruelly
inconceivable to grasp god with the sense
why
should he hide himself in a mist of halfspoken
promise and unseen miracle

how can we have faith in those who believe when
we can not have faith in ourselves
what be going
to happen to those of we who want to believe
but be not able to
and what be to become of
those who neither want to nor be capable of
believe

why can not i kill god within i
why do he
live on in this painful and humiliating way
even though i curse he and want to tear he
out of i heart
why in spite of everything
be he a baffling reality that i can not shake
off
do you hear i

yes i hear you

i want knowledge not faith not supposition
but knowledge
i want god to stretch out he
hand towards i reveal himself and speak to
i

but he remains silent

i call out to he in the dark but no one seem
to be there

perhaps no one be there

then life be an outrageous horror
no one can
live in the face of death knowing that all be
nothingness

most people never reflect about either death or
the futility of life

but one day they will have to stand at that
last moment of life and look towards the
darkness

when that day come

in we fear we make an image and that image
we call god

you be worry

death visit i this morning
we be playing
chess together
this reprieve give i the
chance to arrange an urgent matter

what matter be that

i life have be a futile pursuit a wander
a great deal of talk without meaning
i feel no
bitterness or selfreproach because the live
of most people be very much like this
but i
will use i reprieve for one meaningful deed

be that why you be playing chess with death

he be a clever opponent but up to now i
have not lost a single man

how will you outwit death in you game

i use a combination of the bishop and the
knight which he have not yet discover
in the
next move i will shatter one of he flank

i will remember that

you have tricked and cheated i
but we will meet
again and i will find a way

we will meet at the inn and there we will continue
playing

this be i hand
i can move it feel the blood
pulse through it
the sun be still high in
the sky and i antonius block be playing
chess with death

louse devour we the fever rot we all for the

for the mind of modern people
do they really
expect we to take they seriously

yes now you grin at i i lord
but allow i
to point out that i have either read hear or
experienced most of the tale which we people
tell each other

the angel jesus christ and the holy ghost
all these i have accepted without too much
emotion

i little stomach be i world i head be i
eternity and i hand two wonderful sun
i
leg be time damn pendulum and i dirty
foot be two splendid start point for i
philosophy
everything be worth precisely as
much as a belch the only difference be that

what be you screaming about

i be Plog the smith and you be the squire
Jns

that be possible

have you see i wife

no i have not
but if i have see she and she
look like you i would quickly forget that i would
see she

well in that case you have not see she

maybe she be run off

do you know anything

i know quite a lot but not about you wife
go
to the inn
maybe they can help you

yes it be true
the plague be spreading along
the west coast
people be dying like fly
usually business would be good at this time of
year but damn it i have still get i whole
stock unsold

they speak of the judgment day
and all these
omen be terrible
worm choppedoff hand
and other monstrosity begin pouring out of
an old woman and down in the village another
woman give birth to a calf head

the day of judgment
imagine

it have not rain here for a month
we will surely
lose we crop

and people be acting crazy i would say
they flee
the country and carry the plague with they
wherever they go

the day of judgment
just think just think

if it be as they say i suppose a person should
look after he house and try to enjoy life as
long as he can

but there have be other thing too such
thing that can not even be speak of
thing that must not be named but the priest
say that the woman carry it between she leg
and that be why she must cleanse herself

judgment day
and the rider of the apocalypse
stand at the bend in the village road
i
imagine they will come on judgment night at
sundown

there be many who have purged themselves with
fire and die from it but the priest say that
it be good to die pure than to live for hell

this be the end yes it be
no one say it out
loud but all of we know that it be the end
and
people be going mad from fear

so you be afraid too

of course i be afraid

the judgment day become night and the angel
descend and the grave open
it will be
terrible to see

do you want this armlet
you can have it
cheap

i can not afford it

it be real silver

it be nice
but it be surely too expensive for
i

excuse i but have anyone here see i wife

have she disappeared

they say she be run away

have she deserted you

with an actor

an actor
if she be get such bad taste then i
think you should let she go

you be right
i first thought of course be
to kill she

oh
but to murder she that be a terrible thing
to do

i be also going to kill the actor

the actor

of course the one she elope with

what have he do to deserve that

be you stupid

the actor
now i understand
there be too many
of they so even if he have not do anything in
particular you ought to kill he merely because
he be an actor

you see i wife have always be interest in
the trick of the theatre

and that turned out to be she misfortune

she misfortune but not mine because a person
who be born unfortunate can hardly suffer from
any far misfortune
be not that true

listen you
you sit there and lie to the
smith

i
liar

you be an actor too and it be probably you
partner who be run off with Plogs old lady

be you an actor too

anything on you conscience

knife like they do petty scoundrel of you
kind

why
have i provoke
someone or get in the way
i will leave right
now and never come back

get up so everyone can hear you
talk loud

stand on you head so that we can see how good
an actor you be

what have you do with i wife

do not lie there moaning
get up and dance

juggler

be mikael going to be an acrobat

i trade if i say so myself

difficult to handle once in a while and we have
a little spit so to speak but no bad than
most people

from we darkness we call out to thou lord
have mercy on we because we be small and
frighten and ignorant

in the darkness where you be suppose to be
where all of we probably be
in the
darkness you will find no one to listen to you
cry or be touched by you suffering
wash
you tear and mirror yourself in you
indifference

god you who be somewhere who must be
somewhere have mercy upon we

i could have given you an herb to purge you of
you worry about eternity
now it seem to be
too late
but in any case feel the immense
triumph of this last minute when you can still
roll you eye and move you toe

quiet quiet

i shall be silent but under protest

it be the end

i see they mia
i see they
over there against
the dark stormy sky
they be all there
the
smith and lisa and the knight and Raval and
Jns and skat
and death the severe master
invite they to dance
he tell they to hold
each other hand and then they must tread the
dance in a long row
and first go the master
with he scythe and hourglass but skat dangle
at the end with he lyre
they dance away from
the dawn and it be a solemn dance towards the
dark land while the rain wash they face
and clean the salt of the tear from they
cheek

you with you vision and dream
