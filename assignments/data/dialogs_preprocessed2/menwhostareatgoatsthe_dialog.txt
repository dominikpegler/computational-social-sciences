we


we move towards the wall



as bill django said the force
truly be strong with this one
as the song break into the chorus we burst through the
wall into freedom


as the track continue and we over the land fly
fast and fast free as a bird swoop up towards a
huge until the screen and we


as the pickup with bob and lyn in the back pull up
next to another
two dressed in black with they kaffiyeh covering
they face stand by it stare at they
in the back seat
of the truck sit a blindfold
the driver of the pickup cross to the
with a halfgallon bottle of and pass it to they

he turn and
gesture to the other two young iraqi who push lyn and
bob down from the back of the pickup

apparently have have enough one the insurgent pull his
own out and aim at lyn
the tension build
suddenly
bob remember the phrase he be taught

la termi ana sahafi



immediately everyone stare at bob
the insurgent
at he
terrify bob dive across the sand
the young iraqi
behind he also scramble for cover
still firing the insurgent be suddenly aware of lyn
sprinting towards he
before he can turn to aim at he
lyn into the air spinning around face contorted
as he emit a bizarre
we



now at the time i think lyn be
have some kind of fit here
later i discovered what he be
actually doing be performing the
Echmeyer technique


on a man who look like in a jungle
hat
he have he eye closed in

bead of sweat run down he face
read




ben Echmeyer be a vietnam vet
with sixtythree confirm kill
he remains the only nonKorean to
achieve the rank of master in kwa
ra do
he be one of the jedi
teacher at fort bragg

from behind ben to the row of
watch with expression of mingle admiration and
horror



it be say he could have a tug of
war with a dozen man and not move
an inch
we the back of and find he be from the
waist down
be somehow hanging between his
leg



he be also able to lift bag of
sand on hook hung through his
scrotum
raise a hand




sir what be the practical
application of this


ben lie on the ground stare up at we
we hear the sound of an approaching engine



another demonstration involved
letting a recruit drive a jeep
over he
this in the end be to
be he undo
next second a roar straight over ben going at
sixty mile an hour
we on the



before he untimely death ben
cause quite a stir by advocate
he controversial shock and awe
knife attack method


ben leap spastically in the air spinning and shriek
a knife hold in one hand



the approach be hail by some
knife aficionado as revolutionary
but criticize by other who
believe that the leap and
spinning might lead you to
accidentally stab yourself
as they watch his
display



lyn Cassady however become a
firm convert to the style
we reach who

ben you be not forgotten
the
knife you give i lie next to i
beret
god bless ben Echmeyer



we as he whirl and shriek towards
the insurgent
bob watch amaze from where he lie on
the sand



of course lyn do not actually
have a knife with he at this
particular time
so i still think
what he do be kinda
reckless
the insurgent understandably startle flinch
backwards trip over the water bottle and fall on his
ass
lyn scoop up the gallon bottle of water and begin to
the fall man with it
the young iraqi move to
intervene but lyn smack he in the face with the bottle
the manage to open the
door and stumble out claw he blindfold off and race
away over the sand
the second insurgent be distract for a moment by his
victim flight
when he turn back lyn have scooped up
the insurgent and be aim it at he
beat
nobody move


the sun be rising as the roar over the
sand and swerve onto the road

lyn

what

what be you think

just mahmud
people try to build
something of they live
something last something
good
but there be always someone
want to smash it up








lyn be think of larry hooper
and the part he have play in the
destruction of the new earth army
but in fairness the Jedis own
eccentricity have not exactly win
they many ally in the army



for example there be tim Kootz
who on be ask to ascertain
the whereabouts of general manuel
noriega have reply

ask angela lansbury

what be that tim

ask angela lansbury



we ask angela lansbury

and

she said she do not know where
general noriega be








or there be the time major
general gilling be visiting the
base and see jedi trainee clifford
hickox

practising the ancient sun
dance of the sioux nation





the Jedis survive such minor
scandal protected it be
rumored by a president who be a
fan of both the star war film
and the paranormal himself
but
then one summer
a young likeable lieutenant
called norman pendleton be
recruited to the new earth army





larry hooper wasted no time
befriending the newcomer
desperate to compete with lyn
larry have be do research into
the infamous
experiment which he believe
could enhance he own psychic
power








all he needed be a lab rat to try
they out on check if they be
safe





it turned out they be not




norm
give i the gun norm





norm father who it turned out
be pretty high up in the
pentagon wanted blood






although the Jedis be pretty
sure larry be responsible
nothing could be prove and when
he be called to the disciplinary
hear larry make sure to smear
bill with everything he could


lieutenant colonel django used
fund from the project black
budget to procure prostitute

that be a lie

and also drug for himself and
he man

that be a
well
the hooker thing be definitely a
lie



brigadier general Hopgood resigned
and die some year later
bill
received a dishonorable discharge




continue the work lyn
the world
need the Jedis now more than
ever






after bill left major Holtz of
special force take command of the
Jedis



and nothing be ever the same
again

drumming circle be
not the business of the army
and
love and peace be most certainly
not the business of the army
so
you girl well start think
about how you engage in the
business of the united states
army which in case you have
forgotten involve win
fuck war



when the dust of the pendleton
affair have settled it revealed a
surprise victor





major Holtz regard larry hooper
as a patriotic whistleblower and
the one sound fruit in an
otherwise dubious barrel of
apple

it be some scientific research i have
do for possible offensive psi
application sir
i do
show the report to lieutenant
colonel django but he do not seem
interest




i bet he be not

we have man who can do this

i think i know one sir

but we do not have the resource

well sir
there be goat lab





goat lab be originally created as
a clandestine laboratory to
provide inthefield surgical
train for special force
soldier



the goat would get shot in the
leg with a bolt gun and then a
trainee would have to dress the
wind successfully
goat lab
actually used to be called dog
lab




but it turned out most soldier
do not feel good shoot dog in
the leg






whereas the army have long feel
fine about do stuff to goat
even testing atomic weapon on
they



holy shit



this be the real deal bob
i be
at the gateway
afterwards i
realized i would get injure

huh

sympathetic injury i guess
i be
bruised all over

so it be not that the goat fight
back

goat do not have a chance

but
that be it




i wish it be
hooper told Holtz
we should try the experiment
again
only this time they
said
kill the goat





take out number four



lyn said he have no intention of
killing the goat



there be no way
what have the
goat ever do to i
it be
totally against the way of the
jedi
i be just going to pretend
to try so they would say okay
it can not be do and forget about
it
but then as i sit there i
feel this this pulse start inside
of i and
i could not stop it

you know what i keep think








maybe deep down inside some dark
part of i wanted to see if i
could do it





the goat be dead

goat number four

no
number five



collateral damage

collateral damage
that be
it
i would used i power for evil
and it be like i bring a curse
upon we all
like that poem where
the guy kill the seagull and they
make he wear it round he neck
every night
i would dream of that goat in it
little bib it be mouth open and
closing but nothing coming out




the silence of the goat

i finished i tour and i quit
i
walk out of the unit and i never
go back





but before he could leave larry
arranged one last part gift

prison
they do something much
badly

and finally force in iraq be
use what some be calling a
cruel and unusual tool to break
the resistance of iraqi pow and
many parent would agree
some
prisoner be be forced to

the weather





that be it
that be the only bit
of i story that run anywhere
and
it be a joke
and if i ever
needed proof of how the dark side
have taken the beautiful dream of
what a nation could be and have
twisted it destroyed it that be
it

bob



but i will not stop
i will not give up



because when i look at what be
happening in the world i know
that now more than ever we need
to become that we can




now more than ever we need the
superman
