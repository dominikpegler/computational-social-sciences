by
david Twohy
base on material by ken and jim wheat
revised first draft

though mention often in the script the creature in be
seldom see at length
rather they be glimpsed they be hear they be
feel
they be really the embodiment of you nocturnal fear
howling
coyote that jar you awake
the paint on the wall that come to life
when stare at too long
the sway of you bed just before the earthquake
hit
chimera of the night
the point be make so the reader appreciate
that the focus of the finish film will not be on what the creature do
but on what the creature do to reveal the inner nature of the character
for be at it heart a story of humanity and courage and
lack of the same

the ship then

you know who muhammad be

some prophet guy

some prophet guy
and a city man
but
he have to travel to the desert where
there be quiet to hear the word of
god

to new mecca

Chrislam teach that once in every
lifetime should there be a great hajj
a great pilgrimage
to know god well

i pray you go insane

we can stick to the plan
if we get four
cell back to the skiff we be off this

still out there

oh sure
why not
sound like a hoot

back it up
how long can this last
few
minute
couple hour

i have the impression
from the model
that the two planet be moving as one
that there would be
a last darkness

those sun get to come back
sometime
and
if these animal really be phobic about
light we just sit tight till then

i be sure that be what someone else said
lock inside that core room

look we get to think about everyone now
the kid especially
how scare be she
going to be out there

oh do not use she like that for a smoke
screen

smoke screen for what

for you own fear

hey
why do not you rag you hole for two
second and let someone else come up with
a plan that do not involve

how much you weigh johns

what the hello it matter

how much

kilo

because you be kilo of gutless white
meat and
that be
why you can not come up
with a good plan

i be will to take a cut in pay

how about a cut in you gut

oh trash baby you be going to regret this

please
