right

i try not to let work get to i




i have notice that about you actually

look we be twenty three year old

TwentySeven

whatever same thing i make almost a
quarter of a million dollar last year
for what
pushing some number around
on a computer screen so a bunch of
glorify crack addict could take that
information and pretend to understand it
and then make a bet against some other
jock half way around the world who if he
be not do this would probably be in
some somewhere putting it all on
number seven
and at the end of the day
one guy lose and the other guy win

you do know it be a little more
complicate than that

it be will
he want to know if we have
find he
what do i tell he

tell he that we have not find he



hey




hey

so

eric dale

oh jesus

before he be escort out of the
building by security

i have nothing to do with that

i know

i be sorry go on

so as he be leaving the build he
hand a disk to peter sullivan

who be peter sullivan again

one of Erics guy

right

and tell he that he be almost on to
something but have not be able to figure

job by the way and he seem to have
nail it

nail it

the kid figure out what eric be
miss
and

and

it be not good

as far as i can tell these here be the
historical volatility index limit
which i guess we whole fuck trade
model rely on pretty heavily
and we
be so fucking lever up that if this
thing start get outside those limit
it get ugly in a hurry

how ugly




real ugly

and how close to those limit have we
get

oh we be beyond close
we broke through
five or six day over the last two week
but we have managed to stay on the upside
of it
for now

for now

well look what happen here when we get
on the wrong side of it

what be i looking at

and that would not even be that bad a day
for we
historically speaking

be this right

careful

jesus man

do you know the fear most people feel
when they stand on the edge like this be
not actually a fear that they will fall
but instead it be the subconscious fear
that they might jump

it be a fear of
losing faith

well that be a little deep and depressing
thank you

yeah well i can get a little dark
sometimes

will come on
get down

not today
so it look like they be going to have we
dump this shit

what

yeah you watch

how

trillion buck

i be just saying

how would they even do that




you can not
it be impossible
but they will
figure out a way
i have be at this place
for ten year and i have see some thing
that you would not believe
and when all
be say and do
they do not lose
money
they do not care if everyone else
do but they will not

will

yeah

do you really make two and half million
buck last year

yeah
i do

what do you do with all that money

i do not know really
it go pretty
quick
you learn to spend what be in you
pocket

two and a half million go quickly

well the tax man take half of it up
front
so now you get what
million and
a quarter
mortgage grab another i
give to i parent to live off so
now you get what

eight hundred

i buy a car last year for
probably another eat
on
clothes put away for a rainy day

smart





and what be that

left

i spent dollar on booze dancer
and whore

able to write most of it off as
entertainment


what time be it




oh here they go
they be bringing in
the cavalry
we well get down there


how old be you

have just finally wake up

hello

i be heading to the conference room

i would like you to hear this

i do not want to hear this

how do you think i have stick around this
place so long

i have called Tuld

contingency plan

yes

we go all in on this one

so we have get ourselves quite exposed
here
have not we

to Tuld or the market

both




he be here




we be just grab a cigarette on the
roof and a very spiffy look helicopter
divebombed we and then landed

i know
come with we
where be sam

i do not know
do you want all of we

yes


just one piece of advice to everyone here
before we go in there
this could get a
bit ugly but whatever you do
just
tell the truth
do not try to change a
word of it no sugar coat
no one
here be smart enough
including the
rocket scientist



mr
cohen

yes

this way
they be already in there
waiting for you




please sit down

welcome everyone
i must apologize for
drag you all here at such an uncommon
hour but from what i have be tell this
matter need to be handle urgently so
urgently in fact that it probably should
have be addressed week ago




but that be spill milk under the bridge
so why do not someone please try to
explain to i what be the problem here

well mr
Tuld as i mention early if
you look here at the top page of this
printout

jare it be a little early for all that
how bout in english

actually i would
like to hear from the guy who put this
thing together
mr
sullivan be it
do he speak english

sir

i would like to speak to the analyst who
seem to have stumble across this mess

well that be peter sullivan here

sir

ah there he be

yes sir

how old be you mr
sullivan

i be twentyseven sir

please call i john

yes sir




so mr
sullivan why do not you tell i
what you think be going on here and
please speak as you might to a young
child or a golden retriever i do not get
here on i brain i can assure you of
that

well sir
as i guess you may or may not
know i work for mr
rogers here as an
associate in the risk assessment and
management office at

now you lost i at

sorry

i be joking mr
sullivan

yes
well as you probably know over the
last month the firm have begin
package new product that combine
several different traunches of rate
classification in one tradable security
this have be very profitable as i
imagine you notice

i have

well the firm be currently do a
considerable amount of this business
every day
the problem which be i guess
why we be here tonight be that it take
we
the firm
almost a month to layer
these product correctly thereby posing a
challenge from a risk management
standpoint

and mr
sullivan that challenge be

we have to hold these asset on we book
longer than we might ideally like to




yes

but the key factor be these be
essentially just mortgage so that have
allowed we to push the leverage
considerably beyond what you might be
will or allowed to do in any other
circumstance thereby pushing the risk
profile without raising any red flag

and how far have we push that profile
tonight mr
sullivan

we have push it to
trillion
dollar
at alone

give or take

give or take

now mr
sullivan what i be guessing and
give i a little rope here what i be
guessing that you report here say be
that consider the shall we say bumpy
road we have be on the last week or so
that the number that you brilliant co
worker up the line ahead of you have come
up with in the past do not seem to make
much sense anymore consider what be
taking place today

actually not taking place today but
what be already taken place over the last
two week

so what you be saying be it be already
happen

sort of

and mr
sullivan what do you model say
that mean for we here




well that be where it become a
projection
but

you be speaking with i mr
sullivan

well
sir
if those asset be to
decrease by just percent and remain
on we book
well
that loss would
be great than the current market
capitalization of this company

so what you be telling i mr
sullivan be
that the music appear to be about to
stop and we be going to be holding the
big bag of stink shit ever
assembled in the history of capitalism

mr
sullivan

well sir i be not sure i would put it that
way but let i clarify use you
analogy what this model show be the
music so to speak just slow if the
music be to stop as you put it then
this model would not be even close to
that scenario
it would be considerably
badly

well let i tell you something mr
sullivan
do you want to know why i be
sitting here in this chair with you all
why i get the big buck so to speak

yes

i be here for one reason and one reason
only




i be here to guess what the music be going to
do a week month a year from now
that be
it nothing more
and i be afraid
standing here tonight
that i do not
hear
a
thing
just silence

so now that we know that the music have
stopped what can we do about it

mr
cohen ms
robertson i be afraid this
be where you be suppose to step back
in
lord know we rely enough on mr
sullivan today

what have you get for we

what have i tell you since the first day
you walk into i office
that
there be three way to make a live in
this business
be first be smart or
cheat
well i do not cheat and even
though i like to think we have get some
pretty smart people in this build of
the two remain option it sure be a
hell of alot easy to just be first

sell it all today

be that even possible sam




it be but at what cost

i will pay

really

i think so

almost a trillion buck of paper

where do it come back to we

everywhere

sam i do not think you seem to understand
what you boy down here just say
if i
make you
how would you do it

you bring the trader in for they normal

meet and you be honest with they
they be going to know it be the end either
way so you would have to throw they a bone
and a pretty big one
you would have to come
out of the gate storming
percent
do by
and percent of you
position need to be go by eleven
because by lunch the word will be out
no
swap no nothing and by two of the clock
you will be get cent on the dollar
if you be lucky and the feds will be in
here looking up you ass and trying to
slow we down

ramesh




they will slow you down but it be yours to
sell
they can not stop you

john
let we just say we pull that off
which be saying something
the real
question be
who be we selling this
to

the same people you have be selling this
to for the last two year
and whoever
else will buy it

if you do this you have killed that market
for year
it be over

nod


and you be selling something you know
have no value

we be selling to will buyer at the
current fair market price so that may
survive sam

you will never sell a thing to any one of
they again

i understand

do you

do you
this be it sam this be it

it be

jared you have get till

to break this down and draw i up a plan




be there anyone else who actually know
what be in there right now block by
block

eric dale

where be eric dale

as of today he be no longer with the
firm

we have be trying to locate he

so he be just out there with this
information

nod yes

look down the lawyer side of the table to a secret
service looking guy

carmelo

yes

get i eric dale here by


do

meet back here in an hour
everyone stand up and begin to scatter

sam
let we talk
lead through the back door



they be now alone looking out over the city as the light
from the soon to be rising sun be starting to show on the
horizon
long silence




hell of a town be not it

never really do it for i actually

really

always be kinda a grass and tree guy

i have always loved this place
ever since
i arrive
everything about it

i can not say i feel that about anyplace
actually

be you going to be able to come on board
here sam
they look at each other

i be not sure john
this be really ugly

you and i be salesman sam we sell
that be what we do
it be not complicate

exactly
and you damn well know that you
do not make a sale unless you think the
guy be going to come back for more and
tomorrow we be do
look out and then over at and decide whether or
not to proceed

this be it sam

you keep saying that what be that
suppose to mean

it be the big one
most of we be not going to
make it out of this one




we

the street

what be you talking about

this will not be the last situation i will
be have this week
it be just the start

it be only the start because we be
starting it

maybe
but i do not think that be true not
this time
the number just do not add up
anymore

well i agree with you there i have be
saying that for year

i mean if this kid can come up with
this

i do not think i can go in knowing what i
know and put the hammer down on these
guy like this

oh please when do you become so soft

fuck you soft you be panicking
the word panic slap in the face
he then calm

if you be the first one out the door sam
it be not called panicking
stare aggressively at

look i obviously do not have all the
information that you do
but i think this
could destroy this firm




you will never be trusted again
you be
knowingly putting people out of business
full stop
turn away from and head over to a phone

you let i take care of that
head out the door



sam head into the hallway where everyone be mingle
he
walk over to and

how do that go

this be a fuck shit show

they be going to do it

probably

jesus

remember this day boy remember this
day
walk out of the room
an assistant come into the room

gentleman there be some breakfast down
the hall if you guy be hungry
look at the guy

seth someone be going to have to get
breakfast
and let we face it it be you



be waiting for the elevator again as walk up and
wait with he in silence
there be a housekeeping person
standing next to they as well
the door open and all three
get in



so what be the strategy here

that be where i be headed right now
downstairs to work on it with i guy

no you and i
with Tuld

i be not sure we need one sarah
that be
not the way i have ever do this

please

he know where we both have stand on this
all along
there be nothing more to do

that be exactly i point and knowing what
be discuss by both you and i with he
i do not see how that can possibly you
with anything but a false sense of
comfort

i be not looking for a sense of comfort
here sarah
i do not think there be one
to be find

so again what be the strategy here

on this particular front i be just not
sure there be much left to do





it be very simple
do not even think of
fucking i on this one because if we be
going down
you damn well know it
going to be together

no i be not sure i do know that


what do you think Tuld make last year

would you shut the fuck up

mil
in salary and bonus

really

yeah it be public record

that be a lot of fuck money

he be worth a billion

be

before today

really

you will see




i think i be going to go get a coffee
do anyone need anything

slight head shake no


i need a little real air

probably a good idea

will be that alright

alright

if i get out of here for a minute

yeah
be you kidding
it be not a prison
do you want i to hold you hand

will emerson
yes
oh thank you
i
understand


what

that be Erics wife
he be alive he be
home
he do not want to talk to we
and
he do not know she called i

where be he live

the height




should we call Tulds guy

no
it be eric
the last thing we need
be those guy going over there you two
go try to get he

but you have get to be back here by





may i come in

please sit

so
we be going to do this thing



it be going to be tight

be sam on board

not yet

sarah i need a head to feed to these
trader
and the board
this morning




be it i or cohen

it be you

of course you be well aware i filter
several warning for you and cohen over a
year ago on this

i be not sure that be the good path for you
to be taking at this point
you be
going to be taken care of here


obviously it be quite complicate

john i be tell that in no uncertain
term

it be all a very grey area

it be actually make very clear at the
time by you and i and cohen

i would really prefer that you do not fight
i on this

we all fuck this one up pretty good

yes

we need you to stay here till this be all
do and the market close

i understand




they will go over the number with you
downstairs
good luck


ah fuck it be jare
he be coming this
way

what do wonderboy want

do you have a minute

we be heading to get eric dale

i know
i just need a second

what be it

Tuld and i have concern that sam may not
be will to step up and do the right
thing here

i do not think that be ever be a problem

of course it have not but during acute
situation such as this often what be
right can take on multiple
interpretation




sam will step up

i know he will
but if he do not

but if he do not we need to know that
you will

that i will what

step up

i have no doubt sam will make the right
choice
and if it make you feel any
well he and i have always have the same
interpretation of what be right
no
matter how acute the situation





he take the headphone off music stop
he finally stand
up and mildly limp he way out the office



sam mildly limp down the hallway into the men room



come across the room and over to the sink to
wash he hand
he look in the mirror and then decide to
wash he face as well
he stare at himself in the mirror
the water drip off he face
he look old
just then the
door open and walk into the room
he do not go
to use any of the facility
he stop and look to talk to


there he be

john
walk over and take a towel to wipe off he hand and
face
finally he look up

so what be it look like john
the line be deliver a bit too lightly for
like

cohen have do a nice job
it can work

what do that mean

it mean as you very well know that you
be a very important piece of this
puzzle
they look directly at each other

here
hand a single piece of fold paper
open
it and look at it

that be very generous




it be not a gift
i need to know you be
with i on this

i be with the firm john

i will not get what i need out of you boy
today unless they believe you
unless
they believe in you completely

but you point be passed on
i need

i do not know that be what i be waiting for
now

should be pretty good no

it well be






alright hey

thank you all for coming in a little
early this morning i know yesterday be
pretty bad i wish i could say that today
be going to be less so but that be not
going to be the case
now i be suppose
to read this statement here to you all
but how bout you read it on you own time
and i will just tell you what the fuck
going on here

i have spent the night here meeting with
the executive committee and the decision
have be make to begin to unwind a
considerable portion of the firm
holding in several key asset class
the crux of it be
in the firm
think the party be over as of this
morning
there be going to be
considerable turmoil in the market for
the foreseeable future
they believe that
it be good to have this turmoil begin
with we
as a result the firm have
decided to liquidate the majority of it
position of fix income today

you should be get a breakdown right
now you will see the account you be
responsible for today
i be sure it have not
taken you long to understand the
implication of this sale on you
relationship with you counterparty
and as a result on you career
i have
expressed this reality to the executive
committee and they understand
as a
result if you be able to complete a
sale of you asset you will receive a

million dollar one off bonus




if the floor as a whole be able to
achieve a sale we all get an
additional
million a piece
because
of this if you burn through you
allotment by noon get moving around the
floor and start picking up other guy
leftover

for those of you who have never be
through this before this be what the
begin of a fire sale look like
i
do not have to tell any of you that the
first hour and a half be going to be very
important
i want you to hit every bite
you can find
dealer client broker
and you mother if she be buying
and
obviously no swap it outgoing only
today
this be obviously not the way any
of we would like for this to be going
down but the ground be shifting below
we foot and there appear to be no
other way out

obviously
this be a very unique
situation
if we be successful today
we will have be successful in
destroy we own job
i can not
promise that each of you will be
reposition within the firm but i can
tell you that i be very proud of the work
we have do together here i have be
at this here for year and i know
from experience people be going to say
some nasty stuff about what we have do
here and what you have devote a portion
of you life to
but have faith that in
the great picture we skill have not
be wasted we have accomplished much
and we talent have serve some great
good




by the end of today almost everyone else
in the world including i will have
considerably less money than they begin
the day with
you in this room be
the exception
you will leave here today
rich
you will fire the first shoot i
wish it do not have to be but at time
the market must eat it weak and you
all
be not the weak
we must strike
quick with no doubt if you hear pause
on the line attack
by noon the be
going to be in here get in you
face sniff around you let we take
care of they and you just keep going
we
own what we be choosing to sell today
and there be nothing they can do about
it
year ago this firm be found
today we secure we place for next

start
let we finish this so we can get
on to the next one

going to start sending some people home
out here

world you could have be digging ditch

that be true and if i have be at least
there would be some hole in the ground to
show for it
i be just not quite sure how
we fuck this thing up so badly

jesus when do you start feeling so
sorry for yourself it be unbearable
what you think we may have helped put
some people out of business today

year sam
and if all this be for naught
then so be everything else out there

paper with some picture on it so we
do not all kill each other trying to get
something to eat

and whatever this be going to be
called
they be just the same thing over
and over
we can not help ourselves and
you and i can not control it stop it slow
it or even ever so slightly alter it
we just react
and we get paid well for
it if we be right
and get left by the
side of the road if we be wrong
there be
always be and there be always going to be
the same percentage of winner and
loser happy fuck and sad sack fat
pig and starve dog in this world
yes there may be more of we today
but
the percentage
they always stay
exactly the same
