swing he manacled arm like a club against the tangle mesh he
break free and run
as cameron fly down the back step a station at the rear
door caught offguard try to stop he but be shove flat on his
back
cameron weave and scramble across the yard over fence
between the she would and the barn rolling beneath a building out the
other side
behind he distant shout and a gunshot
as cameron run he move with a skill that suggest forest be not
alien to he
he crouch low follow tiny avenue in the maze
of tree trunk scrambling on all fours over needle and fallen
cone
sweat pour down he face
he breath rasp in he throat
he break into a clear and
suddenly face to face with a
who crouch block he path
it be one of the telephone
linemen we see early
the lineman kneel at he tool chest be surprise by cameron
the other lineman be halfway up the power pole
they both stare at
camerons handcuff
cameron edge back he escape route blocked
the man on the ground grab a and move forward with the same
gleam in he eye we see when he scare that bird from the tree

stand right there like a good old
boy and do what i say

the lineman advance on he as cameron back away

he suddenly stamp his
foot and shriek
Aaaaaaaargh
the lineman jump in surprise
then enraged like a startle bull
he lunge forward with the wrench
cameron use the mane weight
against he his move those of a train fighter
hard knee to
he stomach double up the lineman
the handcuffed arm slam down
like a club between he shoulder blade driving he to the ground
kick throw sideways to he head and the man be out
the other
lineman who have start to descend the pole freeze and take one
step back up
cameron grab the lineman toolbox in he handcuffed
grasp and dash off into the forest
he slide down a slope on a carpet of fall leave tumbling to the
bottom and fall face forward into a run stream where he hold
he head and drink
the terrain
there be no
pursuer the forest be silent
the jaw of a wirecutter clamp down sever the chain connecting
the cuff around camerons wrist
he lift he knee from the
cutter handle
he arm be now free
he wedge a chisel against
one bracelet and swing a sledgehammer against it
we hear his
sharp outcry
double up holding he wrist in pain
the bracelet be still
intact
he button he shirt cuff over the metal band and climb
the slope to the bright sunlight on the road above
cameron be trudge along the old road winding down through the
mountainous pass
he cross a bridge
through the arch of it
low stone railing he see a twenty foot below rush
toward the sea
then glance back he be suddenly alert

in the far distance almost lost in the shimmering heat wave from
the road be a tiny speck moving toward he
he clamber down the embankment behind the railing peer out from
this hide vantage
the speck grow large
the of the engine be faintly audible
now
sunlight flash from metal and glass
camerons apprehension
suddenly change to wonderment for the vehicle be not the police as
he have feared but something else
moving in the shimmering heat
wave be a splendid high humpbacked world war i vintage
with gleam brass headlight roar towards he
he scramble up the embankment to thumb a ride
the duesenberg
roar past he filling he eye and mouth with dust
suddenly
there be a screech of brake
the duesenberg go into a skid and then bounce to a stop
running cameron reach the car pull the front door open and
climb in beside the

thanks
i think you do not see
i
the driver be a husky redhaired man about camerons age and
deeply agitated
pound he fist against the steer wheel he
talk half to cameron half to himself

damn it
screw it up
lose i
nerve
fishing a vicks inhaler from he pocket and shoving it in his
nostril

hotshot expert
thanks for the vote
of confidence
if you think you can
do any well just come and try it
he put he boot in camerons stomach and shove hard
cameron come flying out and land on he back in the road as the
duesenberg squeal forward it open door slamming shut from the
momentum
stun the wind knock out of he cameron rise to he elbow
before the old relic have go thirty yard again the brake
screech swinging the car into a slide salute turn one hundred
eighty degree and it be suddenly screaming back toward cameron


driving with one hand on the door handle he head halfway out the
window watch the bridge railing and the water beyond

cameron sprawl on the road be momentarily paralyze at the sight
of the Duesenbergs great brass grill bearing down
he hand close
over a rock and with the same illogical gesture that a soldier
fling a coke bottle at a tank cameron hurl the rock in the
direction of the car and frantically roll sideways
the big
spinning tire brush he as they pass
we catch a momentary glimpse
of the rock smashing against the gleam of the pass windshield
as he stop rolling once more face down in the dust eye closed
expect death he become aware there be only silence
he open
he eye climb to he foot
the road be empty
the duesenberg be
go
astonished confuse he walk to the side of the bridge
where the railing end and the car might have plunge off
there be
nothing below but the rush black water
here and there bubble
swirl to the surface
they could be from a sink car or could be
cause by the current
he thought racing
be it the sun have he imagined the whole
thing
suddenly a appear hovering almost at eye
level
sunlight flash through the spin blade like a strobe
it be the same helicopter we see in the open sequence
it have
swiftly descend beside the bridge just beyond the railing
catching cameron with no chance to run or hide
can be
see inside the plastic cockpit barely a few foot away
the man
beside the be
he grab the radio microphone and
begin speaking into it
cameron whirl scramble down a bank to a
field
the helicopter drop to within a few foot of the water
hover
protected from sight cameron run between the tall stalk
away from the road
glance back through the stalk as he run cameron see a
barreling toward the sight of the accident
in the back
be frantically putting on black wetsuit
they look
from this distance like little black toy tumbling against each
other
cameron run on

few hotel like a cluster of old victorian gingerbread surround
a sandy cove beyond which be the sea
there be a fish pier
boardwalk hot dog stand pizza parlors all swarm with
sunbathing
the town bucolic turnofthecentury charm
might even survive these if not for a monstrous yellow
which jut ten story into the sky from the center of the
sandy cove
cameron appear on the bluff
survey the town expressionless a jungle beast going to
survive no matter what at least for a few more hour
he reach
down and rip off he trousers leg at the thigh turning they into
cutoff a vacationing bather might wear
he pull off he wear
boot and fling they into the brush he eye never leaving the
town below
there be crowd to get lost in down there
he
unbuttons he sleeve and look at the handcuff still encircle he
wrist
stop beside a large rock he smash the bracelet
against it
it will not open
grimace in pain he rebuttons the
sleeve open he shirt and begin descending the palisade toward
the town
the be yellow and on it be the word


and we realize the word be on the back of a
that jiggle as it wearer walk
it be cameron
beyond
he we see the tide of tourist in oil and ointment flirt with
the sun
teenage girl at portable toilet adjust they bikini
the boardwalk cop in white shirt looking like ice cream vendor
whom cameron deftly avoid
then he look up at the sky
perplex
the helicopter from the bridge be overhead circling
cameron watch it warily as he walk
have form at the railing of the pier
many of the
people with at the sand below
cameron notice the
helicopter be now sharing the sky with a brightly painted open
cockpit
it be a i with
cameron work he way through the crowd
all eye now look upward
at the plane
be coming through an electric



all right people
quiet
we be
losing the sun
this be a take
you be welcome to watch but please
no flashbulb
they will spoil the
shot
camerons world have become more ordered again
it be a film company
shooting on location this somehow must explain the duesenberg
he eye go to the scene below
suspended from the end of the yellow construction crane
be the surf where in german uniform
unload ashore
the bright little plane have start a lazy dive
toward the soldier it engine whining
from here it look as
fearsome as snoopy and the red baron
as the british plane pull out of the dive there be a tremendous
explosion
in the flash of smoke and flame barge rowboat
ammunition and people be blown skyhigh
the smoke from the
explode ammunition momentarily obscure the scene
the onlooker be very impress and please and then abruptly they
pleasure turn to horror and disbelief
as the smoke lift the tom and jerry violence have become a
horrifying reality
body be scattered about
one man have be
severed in half drenched in blood
chunk of meat arm and leg
litter the beach
paralyze by the sense of catastrophe

something go wrong
then people begin to moan and scream

stare tensely at the carnage
by reflex a shout escape his
lip

medic
get the medic
clutch camerons leg
as the scene continue we hear a voice on the bullhorn



cut
i said
that be a print
suddenly the reality of the horror turn into an obscene absurd
farce as what appear to be the miss part of body begin
wriggling out of the sand where the extra be partially buried to
create the macabre effect and now the extra become whole human
being before we eye once again
the crowd react in various way
sigh of relief laughter anger
the exhumed extra wipe sand from they eye and shake it down they
trousers leg


beautiful harvey

everybody a heart attack
the second unit director yell back

eli will hate it
he said he wanted
the shot in one
now watch he will
do six hour of pickup
the crowd disperse
turn to cameron

great

so much blood

realism do not you think


still shaken quietly
mutter

the tourist stiffen as cameron turn away he attention now draw
by the beat sound of the helicopter
he glance up

nina close to tear quickly get up and hurry out of the
theater as cameron sit there numbly stare at the screen
on the portable screen raymond in helmet and goggle be in the
cockpit of an airplane
he stuff a bottle of champagne into a
leather fly boot dangle the package over the side and let we it
go
raymond look down and salute like that famous scene in


who say nothing change
like to
see one of we boy in a try
that
elis voice yell cut on the sound track
the angle on the
portable screen widen and we see that the airplane sit on the
ground with an electric fan blowing wind in Raymonds face

now the scene on the portable screen change
from the ground we
see the same biplane flying low
an object drop from the cockpit
then there be a burst of flame in the engine
trail
smoke the plane wobble crashlands sliding alarmingly close to

it groundloops go up on one wing and as it crash
down we see that the pilot who we assumed be raymond be really a
dummy that be flap absurdly and falling to piece before we
eye during the crash
there be groan laughter and raspberry

point

madness behind all that good clean
fun
why the hell do we pick world

the
ultimate romantic insanity

because it would be a hell of a lot
real than that flapping dummy

i think you wanted something
outrageous















only when i want they to laugh
right lucky
it scream down vertically full power machine gun blaze then
smash into the earth shred to fragment hurl in every
direction
the dead german pilot be fling crumple to the ground
the plane carcass explode filling the screen with fire and black
smoke through which we see a brightly colored descending
the dangle beneath it pass through the smoke and flame
and tumble to the ground rolling he parachute now ablaze
it be
cameron dressed in a british flyer uniform
to show the handheld Arriflex at gabes eye eli behind he
steering gabe by the back of he belt and carrying the battery pack
as they photograph cameron shed the harness
with the camera
they crouch and move together like a threeheaded fourarmed four
legged creature
banking steeply a british fighter roar past cameron it wingtip
almost brushing the ground machine gun rattling driving some
advancing german soldier back toward the wood
the plane touch down to rescue cameron the pilot beckoning
cameron have pull off the dead german pilot boot and helmet
stray bullet strike about he as he sprint to the idle british
plane
it be a singleseater
it start to pick up speed
he
grab a strut and scramble up onto the low wing
the bucket hanging from the giant descend
smoothly eli
guide gabe backward seating he in the bucket
the bucket rise
lifting gabe while he photograph the scene as the plane with
cameron on the wing become airborne
behind it be a who jump up and down shriek
to show nina among they she excitement hardly more
control

the giant arm of the crane swing and rise with the plane
complete gabes spectacular shot
now we see a drop
into frame photograph the plane from the other side
the
chopper and the vintage british plane bank together in perfect tight
formation with cameron stand spreadeagle between the wing
strut like a fly christ as they soar into the sun
seat on the wing he back against he fuselage leg firmly
against the strut
he white silk scarf stream into the tearing
wind
jamming a champagne bottle into the german boot he hold
it up
the pilot grin approval pop the cork on a second
bottle which spout foam into the slipstream
laugh he pass a
glass to cameron and pour from above
the liquid be lost in the
wind
shrug he swig from the bottle and hand it to cameron
cameron drink
the champagne pour down he throat and face and
holding the strut with one hand he rise to he foot
the pilot waggle he wing giving cameron a seesaw ride to get his
bottle back
cameron now seem drink
he let we go of the strut and
stand leaning against the wind
as the pilot toast he courage
camerons balance falter and he grab the strut
now cameron pick he way through the guywires toward the end of
the wing
then he bounce up and down rock the plane
the
pilot start to sing to camerons rhythm how you going to keep they
down on the farm
and cameron dance the charleston
gabe at the eyepiece of the mitchell slowly tilting up and down to
follow the action

Fanfuckingtastic
whaddya be
feeding that soldierboy
brave
pill
through the plastic bubble the biplane can be see in the distance
going through it antic maneuver

it be not what he be eating
it be
what be eating he
that make it
sort of interesting
okay drop the package


cameron hold the boot poised let we go
then the pilot be strike
by a burst she will
as he slump over the plane skid and slip
and drop off into a spin
cameron cling for he life as the
sickening momentum grow until he foot be fling out from under
he and he dangle from the wing whipping in space
suddenly it become clear how what we be seeing be possible the
airplane be no longer in flight but be dangle a few foot above
the ground suspended from the cable of the huge crane
the crewman
shove at it tail and wingtip to keep it revolve
cameron be
indeed clinging to the wing strut he foot hold in space by the
centrifugal force
but if he hand slip he will fall ten foot
instead of to certain death

how be it

Sufuckingperlative

okay now level out
ease some lever back
as the spin slow down and the plane appear to level out cameron
regain he foot perch on the wing and look forward in
grow horror
as the swing arm of the crane glide the plane forward toward a
stand of tree at the edge of a clear

we see the rapidly approaching tree
close and close until with
a horrendous crash the plane sail between two trunk shear off
the wingtip the nose smashing into another hurl cameron off
the wing like a crumb flicked from the table
apparently hurtling through the air he eye widen at the impending
impact
gasp and then a sharp cry
but instead of the
crash
the and we see it be cameron reaching orgasm
with extreme contentment on he face he roll over revealing nina
who it be clear have also have a lovely time
they be in bed in a pleasant large room
untidy with script page wig costume fresh flower the
leftover of a room service dinner
nina caress he back

in the darkness the machine be like an ominous hunchback
splatter shard of light against chuck intensely watch face
he be highly disturbed at the unseen image

crazy bastard
showing a small have be convert to a
makeshift where chuck sit working the
slowly becoming aware of someone he glance up through the spinning
reel and dimly see cameron leaning in the doorway

there be no way it could go
wrong
unless he just go ape
cameron amble over as chuck reverse the film to see it one more
time
even as he catch a glimpse of the film whirring backward
he realize he be seeing in the water
now chuck
have reach the begin of the film and be moving it forward

the underwater camera leaving only the steer wheel and
windshield

of nina as a wild radiant eighteenyear old austrian girl run
pellmell along a willowlined dodge child and
content scatter
he momentary anger vanish as he be infect
with she joy of life
he help she refill the basket and she
reward he with a sausage and a kiss

revealing an
nina sprawl on she stomach stark naked atop
Raymonds naked body she breast resting on he chest she leg
apart interlock with his
they look directly at the
awaiting they cue with the calm resignation of two people waiting
for the wilshire bus
the appear in the shot spray
Ninas back and ass with glycerin sweat from an aerosol can
she
disappear as elis voice on the sound track call
the
into a less reveal more artistic composition
they mouth meet
they body writhe
they stare at the screen in openmouthed shock and horror
they
once gentle hand grip each other like iron claw trying to squeeze
away the nightmare
in shock and anger leaning forward on the edge of he chair
looking from eli to the parent not knowing what to do to stop
this
she sink down in she seat she surprise becoming malicious pleasure
at the reaction of she parent

sweet christ

that

starting to leave she
seat

restrain she
resigned
too late now
only make it bad
we hear the passionate murmuring from the screen as eli scrunch
down in he seat
the lover convulse with erotic abandon as they approach orgasm
like a charles addams render of a brady tintype
they face
wear the stiff freeze smile of the hopelessly insane
she be now make up to look like a woman in she forties
everything
about she tell we these have be brutal year filled with pain
and loss

shame she should be feeling as the woman in elis film at this
mockery of she sones death

she personal despair have be used to accomplish an act trick
and it only add to she degradation and sense of shame ironically
making she performance even more poignant

a fight to dissipate he residual anger

suddenly the
red camera light go on the underwater camera behind he begin
whir
he move he finger behind he for a perfect closeup

shoot this eli
the center of the bridge be an instant away an approaching blur
crouch tensely watch the chalk line on the road as the
duesenberg flash past
he finger press a button


Blam
the whole front wheel of the car be blown off by an explosive
charge
the duesenberg drop on one axle
metal scream against stone as
though it be cameron himself screaming
skidding spinning
tearing through the papiermache railing plunge out of control
into space where it hover for a brief instant and arc downward
like a die bird
cry of such anguish and despair

Ninaaaaaaa
the river rush up and the car smash into it with a deafen
shattering roar plunge beneath the surface to a dark and
soundless world except for a tiny red light the whir of a camera
and camerons desperate cry
tear he seatbelt off he fling
himself toward the rear of the car clawing at the back seat to
reach nina
incredibly there be sunlight again as the car be
buoy to the surface
there again be the live world the
road the tree
in that brief instant through the rear window
cameron have a wild tilt glimpse of a pink pinafore nina
standing by the rail looking down eli beside she
the car nose
downward water rising swiftly over the rear window
the last image
on camerons retina be that wild eager littlegirl excitement on
Ninas face
then he be alone again entomb in the darken water
as the car plunge toward the bottom
cameron sit immobilize at the realization that he betrayal be
total
everyone even nina have conspire to bring he to this
red light glow camera whirring to capture the moment of he
death

outrage galvanizes he to action
he reach for the door handle
to rip they open they snap off in he hand
now there be a
rumble and rend of metal as the roof begin to implode
crushing down toward he
under the immense pressure the rear
window burst inward the river rush in a wild torrent
the
memory of chuck voice
the window
he lower the front window
slowly
the water now pour in fast
the level have rise to his
chin
he gasp a final breath and the water rise over he head
still the red light burn
he reach beneath the seat for the
oxygen cylinder and try to pull it loose
it will not move
the
impact of the car hitting the water have bent the seat frame
he
groping hand find the hose the oxygen mask
hope
though every
second be rob he chance for life he movement under water be
as in slow motion
pull the mask to he face he take an eager
breath and choke as water fill he mouth
the rubber tube have
broken loose from the cylinder and be floating free as it must
have with burt
pressure of the onrush water have stopped as the
water reach the roof
for a moment there be a strange stillness
which cameron he lung bursting swim through out the window and
toward the surface
moving upward through river slime in a world that grow light in
a desperate race to reach air
daylight
gasp half unconscious barely able to move he arm
to stay afloat
adrift in the current he touch land clawing at
the rock and pulling himself onto the shore
he muscle still
moving by motor reflex driven by survival instinct take he
crawling from the river bank through the tall grass still the
fugitive the man on the run
then he lift he head and stop
at what he see before he
fanned out across the field be a row of man gun held ready
policeman from the truck in they german uniform moving forward
slowly carefully searching the terrain in an arch which as it
close must irrevocably reach cameron
it be over
without strength or will he lie waiting for they as
though he eye be make of glass
they see he now but they
pace do not change
as they take the last few step toward he he
see they shoulder waist knee and then only a circle of foot
around he
they hand roughly grab he pulling he to he foot shoving he
brutally about
angry cop faced growl
kill the sonofa

bitch shoot i am cut it hang i be and then loudly cut
it
he feel a blow on the back then another
they seem too
gentle
why be that cop smile
some of they be walking away
where be the handcuff
why be he shaking i hand instead
then
the jumble of voice be becoming clear
no matter what they pay
you make they give you a raise

fantastic i wife think be
a cop be dangerous you guy be terrific
it finally sink in
the insane absurd devastate humiliating realization that it be
all just another scene in a movie that come off as planned
he be alive and free
be that gurgle we hear in camerons throat
the water that he swallowed or an unseemly giggle
then it choke
into laughter

filled with elastic bandage
how funny

hovering with gabe descending the rope ladder bearing film for eli
who run to meet he
