for

barnes used to work for he when he
be still a cop in the field
remember

do not remind i





what the hell happen

Lindenmeyer developed neural
connector that tap directly into
the nervous system
if the
simulator be not calibrate
properly experience death in
this level of be like
experience death within a dream
the experience become real

simulation be suppose to give
participant practice in realistic
dangerous scenario while
protecting they from the risk they
be exposed to in the real world

i be assure the problem be
correct

i do fix it
i told you i do
i
do not know why it happen again

again

i first two pair of convict
suffer the same fate

why be not i tell

black book dollar black book
operation
you pay i for result
not how for how i get you there

i will tell you one thing there be
no way in hell we should allow any
real officer to train in this damn
thing

then about all i have spent
million develop be a very
expensive way to control the prison
population

he
only have a year left on his
sentence

how much do you think i care

do not touch i
do not

i will walk he out

you all right

Whyd

you pull i out

Donley start experience the
attack for real
if i have not get
you out the same thing would have
happen to you
you may not believe this parker

what the hell do you have to shoot
the busboy for

he be a computer program for
crissake

you be suppose to act as if
everything be real

real i ass
it be an overblown
game
anybody ever catch that fucking
psycho

before you nobody else have get
close enough to sid
to take a
shoot at he
hell nobody else have
even be able to start tracking
he before he get to they first
new scar you making it okay in
there

i be get by


you have get to know i tried keeping
you out of general population
goddam politician

do you recognize the sonofa
bitch who get away


should i have

think hard it will come to you

you embarrassed i in front of the
highestranking law enforcement
official in the country
do you have any idea how much money
you just cost i

the reason you insist on test
i system with prisoner be because
of the increase risk involved
with increase realism

of the six prison inmate you have
tested all of whom have have at
least some military or survival
train only mr
barnes be
still breathing

i be still making adjustment

you have have a yearandahalf to
make all the adjustment you want
Lindenmeyer

elizabeth deane do not give
second chance
neither do i
you be fired

i be

you be to turn over the sid

program and all it documentation
for immediate destruction
be that
understood

i understand
i understand
perfectly


hey wallace you really think you
can shut i down

how do he know who i be

he hear
everything

as a matter of fact i do

this be wallace




as a matter of fact little man
you be wrong
i think therefore i
am


welcome home cop


time to hurt

Funs over


i still do not know why they wasted
this fancy new technology on you
every time i fix you up you only
go and mess it up again

tell i how this feel



i will dial it down a little

that about right

it will never feel right

at least they work
would you
rather have no hand at all

sometimes


congratulations reilly

to the first engineer to go
into production on prototype

as long as you keep overpay i
i will be the first to go into
production on three and four as
well

as long as they keep overpay i
i will keep overpay you

just make goddam sure you can have
of they ready for deployment
around the city by next month

mr
wallace i could have of
they ready by tomorrow

do they have to look so
robotic

at this stage you either get form
or function
you said she wanted
function
i give you function
what
be you complaining about

all they want to produce around
here be mediocrity


true genius be rarely rewarded
within it lifetime

it be you be not it


it be i what

you amped the neural connector
back up do not you
you be the reason the convict die
you be the reason i get fired


i could not just let they make you
bring down i degree of difficulty
i be a tripletwisting double back
flip off the high platform not a
swan dive

i god


which god would that be the one
who created i or the one who
created you
in you world the lord give and
the lord taketh away
but in i
world the one who give i life
do not have the ball to stop a
couple of bureaucratic asshole
from taking it away

what do you expect i to do put
you character module in i pocket
and just walk you out of here


i have something a little different
in mind
instead of just playing peeping tom
with reilly why do not you get he
to show you what he be be working
on after hour

hey reilly sheila
s be
asking for you


the cuff will not be necessary

no offense madam but i do not
think that be such a good idea

i would like the follow three
thing in this order
you mouth
shut he cuff off and you ass
outside the door
any question

you actually listen to all those
tape

no i just like the effect a tape
recorder have on you
how you feeling today

little less than yesterday

in other word par for the course
how do you feel about the
simulation you participate in
yesterday

john die

i know
i be there
i see the
whole thing
if i be you therapist i would
have advise you against putting
yourself back into that kind of
situation

you be not i therapist
you be
hear to study i
face it i be
nothing more than a lab rat to you

that be not true parker

if i have die yesterday you would have
already dissect i brain and
analyze it to see if i carry any
genetic predisposition toward
violence

what be going through you mind
when you killed the busboy

not much
he be just a computer
program
nothing more

you do not see the expression you
have on you face when you pulled
the trigger
but i do
you kind of liked it do not you
that thrill of going over the edge
again
of taking out an innocent
bystander or two as long as you
get the target

go to hell

it be just like before be not it
be not it
but you be making progress
instead of killing seven people to
get the one you be after this time
there be only one other person
involve

enough



i need to know what snap in you
what make you capable of it
you
have to make i understand

i do not have to do anything except
survive
and it be taking everything
i have get just to do that



i hope watch i be as big a turn
on for you as dance be for i

oh believe i it be
it be



show over unless i get to see
what you have be working on after
hour

i have not be working on anything

do i get to see it or not

bastard
sheila do not go anywhere
i will be
right back


she be some of you fine work
daryl

all i work be i fine

get that fuck thing away from
i

you be
such a wimp

watch you people auto reset
give i the idea

it be nanotechnology be not it
machine the size of molecule

coordinated by polymer neural net

it feel so

real

it be good than real
it be
synthetic flesh
synthetic blood
synthetic organ
it be a physiological machine

this be suppose to be year away

as far as the public be concern
it be
the reason you get fired
and i get i second demo into
production be i be a lot smart
than you
i never give i good
stuff away

how do you kill it

separate the character module from
the neural net

and you get nanodeath
do not worry i have get a bunch of
other one

amaze
i hate to say it but it
be

i know
i be ready to incubate something a
little more advance than a
coldblooded reptile
if you want to
experience the future meet i in
i office in minute
and bring
the sheila
character module
with you


you catching i drift

i think i understand what you have
in mind


you need a maid

what i need be a nymphomaniac

where be the sheila
module

it feed on what be basically
amniotic fluid
in eight hour we be going to
have ourselves one hell of a play
toy



expect sheila

baby what i be going to do to you

this
be not

possible


sure it be and it be all thank
to the many long hour put in by
you and daryl



real instrument be so much more
responsive than virtual one do not
you think


taste different somehow


i think i be going to like it here


you be wasting you time
i be not going to play any more of
you goddam game

picture of the perp as he left the
build

we do not know how but sid
make

you mean a nanotech synthetic
organism

whatever

other officer in the city will be
hunting sid right along with you

but only you will know he be not
human

ms
deane you wanted to see i

we have an emergency situation
which require somebody with
expertise in criminal psychology
under the authority vested in i by
the president i be giving you
temporary reassignment

what be the assignment

you be going to put you theory
to practice
i be sending you into
the field

quite an improvement
hair well above the collar
standard



regulation
what exactly be i going to be do
in the field


you be right on the border of he
corpus callosuni

he be under be not he

will not stop he from dreaming
though

this be parker barnes six year
ago
the most decorate cop in the
history of



special
investigation division




this be parker with he wife and
daughter
beautiful young family
be not they



this be the group of cyber
anarchist parker be closing in
on



this be what parkers wife and
daughter look like after they
be kidnap and executed



this be what the cyber anarchist
and two people who just happen to
be in the wrong club at the wrong
time look like after parker
finished with they


that be also where mr
barnes lost
he arm to mathew grimes booby
trap
what be you point dr
carter

letting a lunatic like parker
barnes loose in the free world be
like light a fuse
at some
point he will go off you see
what happen in the simulator
the
risk to the public be unacceptably
dangerous

not if you be with he every step
of the way

the man play judge jury and
executioner with eight people
live
he lost control and be
capable of do it again

i understand the risk involved
here
but there be nobody good
qualified to go after sid
than
barnes
and there be nobody who
know he good than you
if a
situation become volatile you
will find a way to quell it
i have
complete confidence in you


i do not need a babysitter

what you need be a collar

she be going to help you understand
what make sid
tick

what she be going to do be get in i
way

this be the personnel file on the
programmer Lindenmeyer
there
might be something in it you can
use

she be not part of the deal cox

fine you want to stay here

officer in Toluca lake just find
an affluent couple
completely
gut
so be the first two cop to
arrive on scene

they weapon missing

sid
be now arm

where be i gun

be careful with it


you remember how to get to Toluca
lake

what be you do

every day for the last five year
i told myself someday i would be
out here again
no more bar
no
more guard
no more fight just to
stay alive
every day for the last five year
i told myself that lie

it be not a lie

every time i said it it be
i
never really think i be going to
make it

you all right

fine
never feel well in i life
see i be a good liar



as



officer continue gather
evidence at this grisly crime
scene you can only ask yourselves
what kind of lunatic would
commit such unthinkable crime

son
of
a
bitch

you ready for this

do not worry
if i can not handle it
i will just kill everybody

i have always wanted to tell you that
if the same thing happen to i i
would do the exact same thing as
you if i have the ball

then you would be a disgrace to the
badge too

he be reenact charles Mansons
labianca murder

manson do not kill the first cop
to arrive on the scene

whoever do this wanted to do
charlie one good to improve
upon what be already do

charlie
you say that like you be
close personal friend

i have spent over hour
interviewing he
charlie killed leno and rosemary
labianca because of the ugly way
the member of he family have
butcher sharon tate
after seeing
the blood bath on television he
wanted to show they how it should
be do
the question be what do charlie
have to do with sid


i know who would know


you drive well for somebody who
have not do it in five year

learn anything from Lindenmeyers
file

he have a twin brother who be a
musical child prodigy who die in
an electrical accident at age
eight
Lindenmeyer go into an
emotional she will until be
all
he do day and night be play the
violin

what happen when he be

every music school in the country
rejected he and he turned to
computer
stay here

any sign of Lindenmeyer

none yet

mind if we take a look inside

not until somebody get a search
warrant signed
it be sunday
i
do not think they have even find a
judge yet

i be going to have to call this in

do what you have get to do
so will i

you have get a problem with i
carrying a gun

do i one favor if you shoot at
anything make sure i be nowhere
near it

looking through his
sight
bang

what be you do

checking i pulse
it be elevate
you enjoy frighten i do not
you

you have studied i now i be study
you
seem only fair do not you
think

this Lindenmeyers a real piece of
work

maybe after they catch he you
should write a book about he

i be surprise you do not write one
about i

i be still working on it

remember a few year ago when music
school be use a computerize
teach tool that accidently
start fry kid brain

i have be in prison remember

the government must have figure
there be no good person to
create a psycho than a psycho

just like they figure there be no
good person to catch one

keeping she eye on
screen
i be the demon from the bottomless
pit

here on earth to create havoc
and terror
i be war i be death
i
be destruction
david berkowitz


i be impress

for murder though it have no
tongue will speak with most
miraculous organ

who said that

hamlet
what be david berkowitz get to do
with sid


he be part of the mix
sid
be a
composite

Lindenmeyer put increasingly
complex combination of criminal
psychological profile together to
develop the ultimate villain

create a whole far more dangerous
than the sum of it part

but rather than select piece
from each individual he simply let
the strong trait of each
individual cannibalize the weak
one

it be a good bet a couple of the
dominant personality team up to
overpower the other
the question be which one of the
dominant then finally managed to
take control

re
Lindenmeyer
he will let we see the ingredient
that go in but not how the soup
turned out after stirring

this be get you pumped up
be not it
this be like the world
series to you

as a matter of fact it be

remember the bowl ball bag sid
carry with he in virtual
reality

dahmer carry the head of one of
he victim in a bowl bag for
over a week
keep it in he locker
while he be at work in a candy
factory
re
sid

we need to get a look at sid
s
final profile

what we need to do be stop playing
with computer and go catch the
sonofabitch before he kill
anybody else

in order to find he we have to
understand what make he tick



daryl Lindenmeyer be only here
briefly one semester at most
but
he be singularly the most
brilliant student i ever have in a
classroom
he created program so
beautiful so lyrical they be
almost like symphony

can you tell we what be on the disc


there be one program with
approximately
million line of
program
it be thoroughly secured which be
not surprise consider
Lindenmeyer created it

think you can get into the program


hard to say Lindenmeyers
protection mechanism be always
diabolically clever

you should see what he be be up to
recently



the dahmer part of i want to boil
you for dinner
the manson part
want to recruit you to become part
of i family
you know what the berkowitz part of
i want to do


craft can only become art when the
creator set he sight on
something never yet achieve
like an apprentice about to become
a master the imitator be about to
become an originator


ever have one of those day where
you decide something important
about yourself
you know where you
say i be not just what i have be
programme to be
i can do what i
want when i want how i want
because i be i own person


you one of they new age asshole


just a soul on a personal journey
what i have realized be that i be
capable of anything
i have to
start expanding i horizon

want
a
drink


to think you constitute one of i
ancestor

listen buddy
think big be
fine

but you should not forget
where you come from either


you know you be absolutely right
would you mind sitting over there

what for


every orchestra be divided into
section
like instrument sit with
like instrument
now be a good
instrument and sit with you
kind


what be they do in los Feliz

madison life two block from they
present location

why would they be going there

i do not know

i wish we could hear they

i engineer say the audio tap
should be ready to field test in
six month


not this one but the next one
the
one with the bicycle out front

i will wait out here

give i you wrist

give i a goddam break
i be not
going to go anywhere alone

and i be going to make sure of it
give i you wrist

Mommys home
Mommys home


grimes you well not be the
dominant


tell you i be not going to go
anywhere

how do you get you hand out

sometimes i like be part
machine

why do not you tell i you have a
daughter

i prefer keeping i professional
life separate from i personal
life

she be beautiful you know

thankyou
she name be karin

want to tell i the real reason we
stopped at you house

i told you it be on the way and i
wanted to change clothes

you should practice lying more
often
you be awful at it
where to

sid
be no longer bound by his
program

what do that mean

now that he be in the real world
there be no long limitation on
he behavior like there be in
virtual reality
sid be going to
evolve

sound to i like a welleducated
way of saying you have no idea what
to do next

what i do know be that whatever
he be becoming sid
be going to
be even bad than he be before

then all we can do be stay mobile
and alert
he be get to make a move
sometime and we have get to be ready
when he do
welcome to police work
