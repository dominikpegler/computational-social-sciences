you will have to handle this situation
yourself as a matter of fact
i be counting on you

yes sir i understand
taking frans letter
out of he pocket

trouble policewise or newspaper
wise

you see the doctor he be a
friend of mine we be very

just jump to the conclusion
around here i be known as quite a
lady man

of course we be not out of the
wood yet sometimes they try it
again yes sir i will do i
best it look like it will be a
couple of day before she be fully
recovered and i may have a little
problem with the landlady
