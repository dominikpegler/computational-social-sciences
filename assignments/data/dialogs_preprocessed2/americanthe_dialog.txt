he
blend in
and no one pay he much attention as he finish
he coffee pay he bill get up and leave
we follow as he pass the parapet of the town rampart
and look across the spectacular valley
towards the desert
at a leisurely pace pass a row of municipal rubbish
bin just inside the fortify gate to the old town
hide well behind the bin we catch sight of jack park

we be right in the heart of the mediaeval old town
like the
stronghold at the centre of a castle
approach a small family run bed and breakfast just off
the main square
the sign read

the internal courtyard be refreshingly cool

in the centre of the courtyard be a make of marble

methodology with which photograph the little town
turn casually down one of the town many narrow
alleyway
the alleyway way bend leave and right in a series of blind
corner and dark tunnel the street enclosed by arch
crisscross by flying stone buttress and flank by
outside stairwell
it be a stalker heaven or hell
depending on how dangerous the prey
proceed along the alleyway until he get to a
crossroads where converge
each
alleyway lead uphill or downhill with vary degree of
steepness

curious turn around walking back the way he come
the sound of barking get loud
on he right hand side find a
the resemble an archer slit but be big
enough for a gown man to slip through
