


of course i have see she film and
always think she be well
fabulous but you know
million mile from the world i live
in
which be here notting hill
not a bad place to be



there be the market on weekday
selling every fruit and vegetable
known to man



the tattoo parlour with a guy
outside who get drink and now can not
remember why he choose i love ken



the racial hairdresser where
everyone come out looking like the
cookie monster whether they like
it or not



then suddenly it be the weekend and
from break of day hundreds of stall
appear out of nowhere filling
portobello road right up to notting
hill gate



and thousands of people buy
millions of antique some genuine



and some not so genuine



and what be great be that lots of
friend have end up in this part of
london that be tony architect
turned chef who recently invest
all the money he ever earned in a new
restaurant



so this be where i spend i day
and year in this small village in
the middle of a city in a house
with a blue door that i wife and i
buy together
before she left
i for a man who look like harrison
ford only even handsome



and where i now lead a strange
halflife with a lodger called

spike

even he
hey you could not help i
with an incredibly important
decision could you

this be important in comparison to
let we say whether they should
cancel third world debt

that be right i be at last going out
on a date with the great janine and i
just want to be sure i have pick the
right tshirt

what be the choice
