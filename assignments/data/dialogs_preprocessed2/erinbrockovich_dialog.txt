just remember
no matter what you mamma

because there be no excuse for it you hear
i

damn it
brenda

yeah

what the hell be this do here

it be those file you ask for

i do not need pity
i need a paycheck
and
i have look but when you have spent the last
six year raising baby it be real hard to
convince someone to give you a job that pay

be the one to hire i

i would love to help erin but i be sorry i

bullshit
if you have a full staff you would

happy

you be around every afternoon

yup
usually working on i bike
no big deal
if it do not work out you
can send they back to the chicken fat lady

this be not going to get you laid you know

yeah we will just see about that will not we

it be in this real estate file i be value
and see i know they be the medical
record from the people selling the house
but it talk about thing like lymphocyte
and suppressers

i mean it be not a problem or anything but
i be just a little unclear on what those
thing be
i think maybe you would know

what do i look like erin
library



Masry Vititoe can i help you



hi rosalind this be erin
Brockovich
from the file room
i be wonder if you
could tell mr
Masry that i be following up
on that real estate thing out of the office

dr
Paulsen

yes

hi i be erin Brockovich
i be just over in
the library there asking a mess of
question about i guess they call it
epidemiology
and the fella there told i
to find you because you know all about it

be this a joke
do baxter put you up to
this

who be baxter

he do do not he
baxter

yeah

oh
oh

no one put i up to anything
i be just
hope i could ask you a couple question

of course
oh gosh of course

well look there be not a ton of information
here but from what there be i would say that
these two people here what be they
name
shanna and ashley

right i guess those be the kid

they have both get some immune system problem
can not say what from whether it be viral or
genetic or what but something wrong
and
these guy donna and peter

they parent i be pretty sure

well from what this stuff say i would say
they both have some form of cancer



whoa whoa
easy easy easy



hi
you have reach the Irvings
leave a
message and we will get back to you just as
soon as we can
Byebye

hi
donna irving

yes

i be erin Brockovich from Masry Vititoe

you be a lawyer

hell no
i hate lawyer
i just work for
they
you get a minute

this be a real nice place you get here



well it oughta be with all the work i put
into it

i added air conditioning put in the pool
make all those pillow by hand

yeah
i should learn to do stuff like that
they make the place feel real homey

thank you
i think so too
that be why i be
be such a stickler on this house price
thing
i do not mean to be a pain in PGEs
backside especially after all they have do
for hinkley but i look around here and i
think if they want this place they be
going to have to pay for it
and i do not just
mean pay for the house
i would like they to pay
i for the trouble of starting over

right

because first you get to move then there be
decorate and if the window be not the
same size you know you be making all new
curtain
honest to god i do not know if i
have the energy
you know i have be sick
i and peter both have

yeah i be real glad you bring that up
i
be going through you file here and i run
into these medical record
they kinda
surprise i

i know
they be more than a bit unusual
see two year ago pete get hodgkins
disease
that be a kind of cancer

yeah i be real sorry to hear that

thank you
it be in remission now thank the
lord but you never know
and then while
that be going on i end up have to have a
hysterectomy
plus a whole mess of lump
remove from i breast
all benign so far
but still no matter how positive you stay
an operation can still take it out of you

i will say
holy moley

so the whole idea of selling the house
do not get i wrong i would be glad to move to
some good place but if they be not going to
pay we properly i just do not see the point

yeah i can see that
i guess the only thing that confused i be
not that you medical problem be not
important but how come the file about
they be in with all the real estate stuff

be you kidding
with how we live be if
i start subdivide file i will be sunk
i
just keep all correspondence in one
place

right but i be sorry i do not see why you
be corresponding with about it in the
first place

well they paid for the doctor visit

they do

you bet
pay for a checkup for the whole
family
and not like with insurance where
you pay then wait a year to be reimbursed
either
they just take care of it
just
like that
we never even see a bill

wow
why would they do that

because of the chromium

the what

the chromium
well that be what kick this
whole thing off



come around a few year ago told we
they put chromium in we well by mistake
and since we should not have to drink it if
we do not want to they give we free spring
water and offered to buy we house

what be chromium

it be a chemical they used over at that
compressor station up the road there

well hell maybe that be why you all have
be so sick

i think the same thing right off the bat
that be why we go to see the doctor
but
hunhuh
turn out one get nothing to do
with the other

this be the info they give we
you will see
if you look through it chromium good for
you
when i see what they charge for it at
the healthfood store i about fainted

seem like an awful big coincidence you
water be messed with and you be so
sick

not around here
this be a rough part of
the world
hard time not a lot of money
not a lot of luck
it be a challenge staying healthy in a town
like this
heck even we dog up and die

what be you do

well safe than sorry

you want some coffee george

i be going to put a dead bolt on you front
door too
this be not exactly the safe
neighborhood in the world you know

thanks for remind i

i guess we get what we pay for huh

you think it could make you sick living in
a place like this

what do you mean

i be talking to this lady she and she
husband both get cancer and she think it be
because they live in a bad neighborhood
you
think that be possible
that live in a bad
neighborhood could give you cancer

man i hope not
you get enough damn
problem

hi you all how you do today

Hangin in baby
how about yourself

i be okay i be just fine
i be wonder
could i maybe ask you a couple question

and when i realized we area just as
bad as hinkley i think maybe i neighbor
be all sick too
so i go and ask

you do

Uhhuh
spend the last few day knocking on
door
and you know what
they be not
i mean they get problem but none of this
cancer stuff
and they pet be fine
so
i do not know i just can not shake the
feeling that it be not no multivitamin they
put in the water

well if you be talking about contamination
you be get out of i area of expertise
let i give you the name of a toxicologist
friend of mine over at

i get to say erin first time i see you i
do not peg you as the kind to go off and
conduct she own epidemiological study

do not go telling anyone
it will ruin i
reputation

what kind of chromium be it

there be more than one kind

yes
there be straightup chromium do
all kind of good thing for the body
there be chrom which be fairly benign and
then there be chrom hexavalent chromium
which depending on the amount can be very
harmful

harmful like how
what would you get

with repeat exposure to toxic level
god anything really respiratory
disease liver failure heart failure
reproductive failure chronic headach
bone or organ deterioration plus of
course any type of cancer

so that stuff it kill people

oh yeah
definitely
highly toxic highly
carcinogenic
bad bad stuff

well how do i find out what kind of
chromium be up in hinkley

have you be to the water board

Hunhuh
what be that

every county have one
they keep record of
anything waterrelated within they
jurisdiction
you should be able to find
something there

county water board
all righty thank

good luck
oh i would not advertise what you be
looking for if i be you



incriminating record have a way of
disappearing when people smell trouble

chromium it be poisonous

yeah

well then it be get to be a different than
what be in we water because ours be okay
the guy from told i
they sit right
in the kitchen and said it be fine

i know
but the toxicologist i be talking
to
he give i a list of problem that can
come from hexavalent chromium exposure
and
everything you all have be on that list

no
Hunhuh see that be not what the
doctor said
he said one get absolutely
nothing to do with the other

right but do not you say he be paid by










how come

what be she do here

he hired she back

sitting up and taking notice

david baum from be at reception

nice to see you again too brenda

not to question you judgment or anything
mr
Masry but that do not exactly look
like sitting up and taking notice to i

in the interest of putting this whole
thing to rest be will to offer the
Irvings dollar for they home



in term of land value out in hinkley mr
Masry we feel it be a more than fair price

what about in term of medical expense
do not come close to what this
family going to have to spend on doctor

i understand they have have a bad run of luck
healthwise and they have i sympathy
but that be not PGEs fault

you be kidding right
look at these reading for christs sake
PGEs own technician document toxic
level of hexavalent chromium in those test
well on numerous occasion

everything the Irvings have have be a proven
reaction to exposure to hexavalent chromium
they have have

breast cyst uterine cancer hodgkins
disease immune deficiency asthma
chronic nosebleed

million thing could have cause those
problem
poor diet bad gene
irresponsible lifestyle
we offer be final
and more than fair

wait a minute i think we be
negotiating here

be all i be authorized to offer

jesus christ
i will present you offer to i client
i
doubt they will accept it

mr
Masry before you go off on some
crusade you might want to remember who it
be you be dealing with here
be a
billion dollar corporation

thanks
i will keep it in mind

at least they make an offer

that be not an offer
million would have
be an offer
when they send the god damn
mail clerk down to jerk i off waste i
time it be a fuck you

i do not get why they would do that

because they can
you hear that kid
they have billion dollar at they
disposal
they can afford to waste all the
time in the world

and you can not

what you think i be make of money

hey you know where i can get a cab
i
plane leaf burbank in fortyfive minute

tell you what why do not you go on over to
reception tell they i said mario should
take you to the airport

bathroom
they will be driving around the
valley for hour

yeah
be not that a shame

well i will be god damned

you have be reading for hour

i be a slow reader on account of the fact
that i look at the word dog and see god

hey just so long as you see he

excuse i be you erin Brockovich

yeah
who be you

i be tom brown
this be i wife mandy
we
used to live across the street from the
Irvings
buy we house last year

it be called wry neck
it be when they be
born without any muscle in the neck

wow
how many be born like this

twelve maybe thirteen

when donna told we about you and what you
told she about the chromium we figure that
might have something to do with this too

it sure could yeah
thanks a lot

there be something else too

what

well
mandy here have nine miscarriage

be you kidding
i god

i know
it be an awful lot

i be surprise donna do not say anything

she do not know
no one do
it be not
something you want to talk about you know

i figure it musta be something i do
like when i smoke marijuana maybe
or
take birth control pill
but then donna
told i you think this chromium might be
to blame for she problem so i figure

hey
you guy still awake

come on now
no fake
george told i he
just shut out the light a few second ago

look i know you be mad
but the way this
job be thing come up at the last minute
real important thing and i get to deal with
they
now i do not like i miss dinner
any more than you do but we be all going to
have to get used to it because the fact be
it be going to happen sometimes

it happen all the time

that be not true
we have dinner together just
last night

you be reading the whole time

i be sorry pumpkin

harder to be around okay
i promise

hello

hi babys
Babys fine
yes i do

babys
okay here you go

Byebye
byebye
no you
okay
together
Byebye

um you mind pulling over
just for a
second

first of all do not talk baby talk to you
wife in front of i
it
really
undermine
you authority
and second i know you be
i boss and all but you be the bad
fuck driver i have ever see
move over or
i quit



there be something about this whole thing i
do not quite understand mr
Masry

if mess with we water why would
they bother saying anything about it to we
why not just keep quiet about it

to establish a statute of limitation
see
in a case like this you only have a year
from the time you first learn about the
problem to file suit
so figure
we will let the cat out of the bag tell the
people the water not perfect
if we can
ride out the year with no one suing we will
be in the clear forever

but it be more than a year ago that they
told we

it be okay
we be not suing
all we be
do be use this information to get you
a real nice purchase price on you house
and get you two
a comparable retroactive bonus added to
you sale price
this way and can
still look good to they shareholder because
they be not involved in an ugly lawsuit
all
they be do be buying a little property

it do not say here how much this whole
thing going to cost we

i fee forty percent of whatever you get
award

boy do i know how you feel
first time i
hear that number i said you get to be
kidding i
forty god damn percent

erin

i be the one who be injured and this joker
who sit at a desk all day be going to walk
away with almost half i reward

erin

then i ask he how much he make if i
do not get anything

then i do not get anything either

and i realized he be taking a chance too

all right then
let we hit the road

mr
Masry if you do not mind i saying you
get a lot to learn about be friendly
these people just hired you as they lawyer
the least you could do be make a little
pleasant conversation

donna let i help you clean all this up

so what be uh
what be new

you know that thing it say in here about
rash

Uhhuh

well this old neighbor of mine bob linwood
he run the dairy on community seem
like someone in he family always have a rash
somewhere or other
i just figure it be
something in the gene
and you know how it
be you do not like to ask about thing
like that



excuse i
be you mr
linwood

yeah

i be erin Brockovich
i work at the law firm
that represent you former neighbor the
brown
they suggested i give you a call

boy how do you do i ever wear the wrong shoe

and mr
linwood seem to think that
you husband have be sick as well

yes mr
DeSoto have lung cancer
never
smoked a day in he life neither

mrs
DeSoto said she be not sure exactly
what it be that you have

she be not alone on that one

well they know what it be it be called
fibrous dysplasia

the bone start grow again
give she
headach like you would not believe

they just do not know what cause it

then mike Ambrosino remembered seeing
you folk at the hospital from time to time
too so i think i would just stop by
you must be annabelle

Uhhuh

whew be you ever a beauty
i mean you
must drive those boy crazy

tell i something george
what kind of god
let we a beautiful little yearold girl get
brain cancer
be not he suppose to be in
charge of stuff like that
make sure it
do not happen
i swear any other job he would be fired

Hunhuh
absolutely not

that be crazy why not

because i said no
look the only reason
PGEs even talking to we be because this be a
quiet little real estate dispute
we add
plaintiff and suddenly we be in the middle
of a toxic tort with a statute problem
against a massive utility
no thank you

okay so here what i will do
i will go on up
to ted and rita daniels two of the nice
people you would ever hope to meet who spend
every single day watch they little girl
fight like a dog against this cancer i will
tell they we can not help they because you do not
feel like working that hard

it be not about working hard

bullshit

it be about be realistic
something
like this erin it could take forever
they be a huge corporation
they would
completely bury we in paperwork
i be just
one guy with a shitty little
i
firm

who happen to know they poison people
and lie about it

and this shit be bad news mr
Masry
not
only do it attack every organ of the body
it fuck with you too
that means
these people gene and the gene of they
kid and the gene of they grandkid

i know how work erin

we can get these people
with a little
effort i really think we can nail they
ass to the wall

oh you do
with all you legal expertise
you believe that

okay fine
i do not know shit about shit
but i know the difference



damn it

how many family we talking about here

four more
eleven people
so far

you think there be more

well i find one document at the water
board that have a toxic test well reading
from
hell of a lot of people have
live on that land since then

this be a whole different ball game erin
much big deal

kinda like david and what ishisname

kinda like david and what ishisnames whole
fuck family
okay here the deal if and only if
you find i the evidence to back all this up
i will do it
i will take it on

you be do the right thing mr
Masry

yeah yeah
remind i of that when i be
filing for bankruptcy

course gather evidence now that be a
big job
hell of a lot big than just
file
i be going to be working a lot harder
now taking on a lot more responsibility

what now

another raise would not hurt
and with all
the time i be going to be spending on the road
i will probably be need i own cel phone

you each can pick out four thing
but
nothing huge
look at the price

dr
frankel it be erin Brockovich
tell i
something
if i want to find as much evidence
of hexavalent chromium contamination as i
possibly can what should i do



well what you have to remember be if you
have hex chrom in the water you have it in
anything that live off the water



what i would do be start a collection
anything
that exist in water on water under water



anything that have water flow over or under
it



anything that have water pass through it



collect they label they then bring they
to i
i will analyze they see what we get

for god sake erin i can see you
panty

arrogant fuck want i to think that
because they get all this money and power
we do not stand a chance in hell against

they be wrong

it do not have to be this complicate
erin
there be a lot of job out there

you mind telling i what that be suppose to
mean

nothing

if you get a problem with i taking care of
you kid instead of get some job just

i do not say that

because i can get a job

well come to think of it we do have a big
event around here
beth start talking

what
beth
i beth

yeah
we be sitting around at lunch and
she pointed at a ball and said ball


i would never see that before someone
first word
pretty intense

be that what i think it be

she live on the plume
you never know

this be the community pool

yeah that build
the whole time we
think it be alga that make it so green

i be bore and so be the kid

just a few more minute then we can go
take she will you

erin this here frank melendez
he work
over at the compressor station

i be sorry
what be you saying

i need a ride

you want to talk about

no

what
asshole



um erin
this be mike
Ambrosino

she be about to take a handful of these

it be a morphine thing for pain

i be embarrass

that be okay
i understand

it be just the pain
it be only get
badly
i can not be a good wife
i can not be
a good mother

i be real sorry laura

know what i always think i wanted outta
life erin
jaguar

jaguar a darn pretty car

i think if i could spend that kinda money
on a car it would mean everything else be
fine
i do not even know how much they cost

lot
but you hang in there maybe you will
get one

would not mean the same thing

they used the hex chrom here in these
cool tank as an anticorrosive
then
they dump it here in these six pond

i do not remember seeing any pond up there

they covered they over
and not too
carefully either because you dig one inch
under the surface and the dirt be green as
a fuck shamrock

and that be what cause the contamination

it do not help but no
the real problem
on the bottom

see accord to this they be suppose
to line the pond so this shit could not seep
into the ground
but guess what

they skip that step

i guess it be a little too inconvenient
so for fourteen year this stuff flow
into the groundwater free as you please

jesus
i do not even want to ask what you do to make
this melendez guy talk

for you information frank care what be
in those pond because he used to spend half
he day wading around they
that be he
job

no shit

no



hot
hot
hot

you
asshole

erin lemme tell you something
if da
put three researcher on this i would not
expect they to dig up all the information
you get here
this be some damn good work

yeah
then give i another raise

hey i get a staff to pay plus rent plus i
have not bill a minute of i time since i
start on this case so you can quit
hitting i up like i be rich or something

rich off of this mr
percent
we get
those fucker by the ball here

we have get the fucker in hinkley by the
ball
but nobody get rich unless we
can pin this on the corporate fucker
in san francisco

what do you mean

corporate be claiming they have no way
of knowing what be going on in hinkley

oh they know
they have to know

show i the document that prove that

then they do not know
and if they do not
know we can not hit they for punitive damage
and punitive damage be where the money be

jesus christ ed you know the more i
work on this thing the more i realize what
a crock of shit this legal system be
here

aquifer that build a pool for a town
then filled it with toxic water and

sure wish i have longer to get used to the
idea
you think if you get no uterus and no
breast you be still technically a woman

sure you be
you be just a happy woman
because you do not have to deal with maxipads
and underwire

we be going to get they be not we erin
you
get to promise i we be going to get they

if they have send that little shmuck baum
again i be going to be real pissed off

from they tone of voice on the phone i would
say they be taking we more seriously

yeah i hear that one before

mr
sanchez mr
webster mr
buda and ms
cooper from be here

jesus
they look like the secret service

they be trying to intimidate we
tell they to wait in the conference room

Counselors


Counselors

let we be honest here
two million dollar
be more money than these people have ever
dream of

oh see now that piss i off
first of
all we get moreen a hundred plaintiff
they may not be sophisticated but they do
know how to divide and two million dollar
be not shit when it be split between they

erin

and second of all these people do not
dream about be rich
they dream about
be able to watch they kid swim in a
pool without worrying they will have to have a
hysterectomy at age like rosa diaz a
client of ours or have they spine
deteriorate like stan bloom
another client
of ours
so before you come back here with
another lameass offer i want you to think
real hard about what you spine be worth
mr
buda or what you would expect someone to
pay you for you uterus miss sanchez
then you take out you calculator and
multiply that number by a hundred
anything
less than that be a waste of we time

um erin

i favorite person in the world

compliment anna and just say thank you

do you think we would do well by going to
trial

maybe
but maybe not
we still do not have
anything linking this to corporate
plus there be the statute problem
plus
we be way short on manpower so we would need to
bring on more lawyer

plus percent of million a whole lot
of money

it be eight million dollar erin
eight
million dollar

that be a fuck fortune ed
and you know
i be the last person on earth to walk away
from a big payday

get into this to get rich
we do it because
we both have this voice in we head saying
do the right thing
get these plaintiff
what they deserve the right to live and
die in some kind of comfort and peace
if

we would enter into bind arbitration
judge no jury with a settlement to be
between and million dollar

any precondition on the settlement

the plaintiff have to agree to it
unanimously
and they be bar from ever
discuss they settlement with anyone

and shove it up you ass

holy shit

matthew

matthew


god damn it matthew
what the hell be you
do out here

i be going to go live with george

if you leave here real fast i might not
kill you

we will work out the roller hockey thing
okay
whatever you want we will work it out
i promise

you always say that
then you go to work
and forget you promised

i never forget honey
i try real hard
it be just for some reason i do not seem to
be able to organize thing right and when
it come to you guy i end up falling
short

you never fall short for the work people
i
guess maybe you just love they more

oh god sweetheart no
there be nothing on
earth i love more than you
nothing
i promise

i be looking for erin Brockovich
they
bring she in in an ambulance

meningitis
what the hell be meningitis

it be an inflammation of the spinal cord and
part of the brain

jesus

she must be a tough cookie because it be a
pretty advance case
i would say she be be
walking around with it for a few week now

how do someone get meningitis

usually in adult it be from exposure to
bacterium or a virus or

or lemme guess toxic waste



they can stay at i place till you go home

they said that would be tomorrow
they just
want to keep an eye on i another night

fine
i will drop they off tomorrow afternoon

thank you

Mmhm

george hang on
look
i be sorry
i just

i will drop they by tomorrow

if you be here to fire i you time
lousy

i be not going to fire you
i wanted to
but then you get sick and
that would have make i look like a shit
you embarrassed i erin

i know
i be sorry
do i get to hear what happen anyway

between and million definitely

Uhhuh

and if you have to guess

with nothing linking it to the corporate
office yet i would say we will end up on the
low end of that
still a lot of money

so why would offer it

because
they know the evidence
they know
they be going to lose a jury trial
maybe they
would not lose million buck but once
you factor in all they would spend on this case
in the next ten year it make a lot of

wait what do you mean ten year

five year maybe for a trial
double that
for the appeal

i be sorry be you saying that if this thing
go to trial it will be
ten year
before
these plaintiff see they money

hey that be not so bad
compare it to the
love canal that be twenty year ago and
those people still have not see a dime
so
in legal term ten year be

fuck legal term
we be talking about human
being here
sick people
whole bunch of
they be going to be dead in ten year
they
need they money now
we get to get they to agree to the
arbitration ed
we get to get every damn
one of those plaintiff to

i know
we be have a meet it be all
set up

when
where

tuesday at seven at the hinkley firehouse

okay good
i think i should be the one to
tell they because they trust i more than

you be not going to be there

the fuck i be not
i do not care what the
doctor say

this be not doctor order
it be mine
i be
saying you can not come

why not

because kurt do not want to work with you
he think you be a loose cannon

fuck kurt

erin

no i be serious
you know what kurt potter
be
he be the kind of guy who never would
have taken this case in the first place
he be the kind of guy who would have sell
these plaintiff down the river when
offered million
he do not work like
we ed
there be no little voice in he head
telling he to do the right thing

do not come erin
i mean it
if you do
i be going to have to fire you
just
concentrate on get well

come on kid we be going for a ride

binding arbitration be not all that different
from a trial
it be overseen by a judge
evidence be presented in much the same way

stay in the car baby i will not be long



and then a jury decide



no sorry i should have mention that
there be no jury in bind arbitration
no
jury and no appeal



no appeal
so what be we option if we
do not like the result



well you have none
the judge decision
be final
but i really do not anticipate
that as a problem

you do not even know what it be going to be
how
do you know we be going to like it

as i said before it will
definitely
be
somewhere between and million
dollar

which
there be a big difference there

i would not want to speculate at this point

ed what do you think it will be

i think
Kurts right
we should not
speculate

so then what that mystery number divided
up at the whim of some judge

judge do not make decision base on whim
madam
they make they base on precedent
and evidence

fucking idiot

look
everyone
be this a big decision
absolutely
but i do believe that if you
put a little faith in the system you will be
quite please with the outcome

mr
potter if you know i from adam you would
know that be please be not an option for
i anymore
now do not take this personally
sir but i have never see you before in i
life
i be not about to put i faith in
anything just because you tell i to

can i have one of those counter thingy
please



i do not want to stay here
it smell

we get no choice
i be not going to make it
home tonight
now go wash up and climb into
bed
