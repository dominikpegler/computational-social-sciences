be a good man in he job because he
give more than most
and it be too
easy to say that he be a good man
in he community because he give
more than other
and it be too easy
to say he be a good man at home
with he family because he be always
there when they needed he
special

count of murder in the first degree

the defense may now proceed

jesus christ

i do not know where

be you sure

they look all over

what be wrong

they can not find the murder weapon

what be you talking about

Dunners

they can not find the
goddamn gun

they lost it or something
misplaced
it i do not know
they can not find it
anywhere

what


i do not have a goddamn case without
the goddamn gun
he fingerprint
the ballistics everything
i have
to have the fuck gun or he be going to
walk
that murder piece of filth
will go free without the

how
could they lose it


the dunner gun you used the fuck
dunner gun

this be not i fuck up
we shoot
be suppose to be gangrelated and
unsolved
only because we tag a
goddamn undercover cop do we need
the fuck
for evidence
otherwise we never would have needed
it
so do not point you finger at
i

alright alright
but how be we
suppose to explain how the same gun
be used in two murder case by two
different killer when it be suppose
to be in police custody

we do not explain it
it be not we
fault they lost the evidence
ballistic be already complete in
Dunners case
all we need be another
gun


all i merchandise be in top
condition
untraceable
the good
money can buy

it be get good knock down but it be
slow
unless you have a preference
for revolver i suggest a nine
millimeter auto
they be more
expensive but what they cost in
money they save in time

the


what

you look like police

no offense

very long time

yes i know i read you confession
joe if you really feel you life
be in danger we might be able to
use selfdefense as we argument
but before we get into that
do

joe
do you know what a psychiatrist

i be not sure

joe you do not remember much about
yourself

shoot the man in the car

why

because
i can
i be sorry
i be not much help


and when you approached the suspect
in he apartment do you identify
yourself as a police officer

yes

do the suspect respond

yes he do

in what way

he start shooting through the door

the defendant fired six time until
he gun be empty
we would like to
show you the weapon he used

and we would like to enter it into
court record
it be the same smith
and wesson revolver he used to
viciously murder george and carol
Beaman

the prosecution would like to call
mr
steven
allen to the stand

steven
allen

mr
allen would tell the court what
you do


i be a lab technician for the police
department
one of i duty be to
examine weapon used in violent
crime


i test the defendant revolver
and match the bullet fired to the
bullet remove from the deceased

that be not i gun

i must remind the defendant that he
be not to speak out when

that be not i gun

be not

you be

be not


we get to put the right gun back

we can not put the right gun back
without that gun they will not convict
joe

without that gun they will not convict
clyde

i be not worry about clyde i be
worry about we

look joes never going to trial
right
he signed a goddamn confession
like you said this one be open and
shut
Clydes the one we get to worry
about
we can not let he go back on
the street
he be a fuckin psychopath
he will kill somebody again

shit
how the hell do that piece of
puke know it be not he fuckin gun
i do not think he know he own fuckin
mother but he know his fuckin
gun

i do not think that be important right
now


sorry Divinci can not do it

what you mean you can not do it
i
get to check something

you get to get written permission
from the chief

since when

since an hour ago when he come down
here and chewed i a new asshole
big than a three car garage

what be the problem

something about miss evidence or
who the hell know
i just want to
transfer the hell outa here

what the hell we suppose to do

ask the chief
policy be not i
department


whenever you be ready

we would like to plead not guilty to
the charge of murder at this time
for reason of insanity

but i do it

yes joe
let i handle this

but i signed the confession

yes joe
do not worry about it
i be
the attorney

you honor can we have a moment

council may approach the bench

you honor i colleague client
admit to the kill
i do not see
any reason to go through a trial
when it be obvious he would like to
plead guilty

i do not agree

if he want to plead guilty you
have to let he plead guilty

not if he be not of sound mind

come on elliot

i think he be crazy
i know you think
he be just putting it on that be

standard procedure but i do not think
he be
so you honor i be standing
by the not guilty because i believe
he be incapable of making that
judgment

have you have a psychiatrist look at
he

yes you honor
i think you will see that i diagnosis
be not without warrant

i will review the finding and make i
decision tomorrow

thank you you honor
besides i hear there be a good chance
of beating the charge for lack of
evidence


nobody can connect we to the evidence
thing
we be clean there

the most important one be this
mess anyway
once that be finished
we be completely in the clear

you know we can not do it anymore

yeah i guess

no we be through
that be it

i just want to get through this

we be going to get through it

Nobodys ever going to miss

crime a smith and wesson fortyfour
caliber handgun

all these goddamn gun be startin
to look the same to i


and when you arrest the defendant
do he deny that he have killed agent
hudd

no

can you describe the defendant
condition at the time of he arrest

he be drink
we could smell the
booze on he
but we draw blood
he
do not object

we have the blood test report that
show
that he have four time the legal
limit to drive
the people would
like to enter this into evidence


and you arrest the defendant
four day after the kill
what
lead you to suspect mr
mccall

you ask question
work the
neighborhood
find out who be on
the street that night

yes but specifically mr
mccall
he
have no previous criminal record

we find someone who see he in
the area
so we picked he up for
questioning
we do not expect it to
be he
but if someone see he in
the area that night we would want to
talk to he
if he be not the killer
he might have see the killer
just
routine really

where do you find the defendant

on the street
corner of third and
madison

what be he do

he be passed out

but you know it be the man you be
looking for

yes

base on what

he description

who provide you with the description

cynthia something i think

i believe she name be cynthia webb
accord to the statement file the
night she picked he out of the line
up
the name familiar

yes
that be she

where do you find ms webb

on the street
same area

and she agreed to pick the defendant
out of a line up

yes

where you aware that ms webb
disappeared after she be serve
with a subpoena

yes i partner and i tried to contact
she about the case and be
unsuccessful

thank you detective that be all the
question i have


to justice in all it form

we be not home free yet

without ms webb there be no place
they can go
we still get the
confession the gun the ballistics
and i do not give a shit about all
this african doctor crap
the man
be a drink and he be be a drink for
seven goddamn year
so let we have a
drink for drunk

that be the thing about life
you
control it or it control you
most
people do not understand that
they
try blame they fuckups on
something or somebody else
but it be
not like that
i do not want to hear
why you life a mess
it be a mess
because you be a mess
that simple
they be waitin to live happily ever
after

serious otherwise you get fragile
and you can not be fragile and have
any fuckin fun

you think i be fragile

that be the first sign of trouble
when you start askin other people

i just wish i know where the hell
she be


so i think we will have to rely on
the confession for he description
of what happen
he will never take
the stand even if



s office

when
where will

they find cynthia webb

miss webb have you ever see the
defendant before that night the
night you described to we

no

do you know what perjury be

when you lie

when you lie under oath in a court
of law
do you know what the penalty
for that be

you go to jail

yes
cynthia have you ever see
the defendant before that night

objection
the witness have already
answer that question

sustained

i just want to give the witness the
opportunity to remember if she could
have see mr
mccall anyplace else
before the night in question

ms
webb do you understand the
consequence of perjury

yes

let we get on with it then

what do you buy the night you go
into the minimart

what do i buy

you remembered seeing mr
mccall
that night and hearing the gunshot
and a car crash
i just wonder if
you remembered what you buy in
the minimart

shampoo i think

that be all

yes

where do you live

th street
number

be that close to where this mini
mart be

close
sort of

how far would you say

i do not really know

within walking distance

no
i do not think so

do you walk there that night or
drive

i ahh
drive

you drive
but when you left the
minimart you stated that you walk
down the street

yeah

how far

to the corner

objection
you honor i do not see a
point to this line of questioning

be there a point

yes you honor
since this be the
only witness i be trying to establish
what the scene be like that night

try to get there as quickly as
possible

and how far away from the corner be
the Minimart
for example be it in
the middle of the block close to
the corner where

in the middle i think

so you walk all the way to the
corner
i assume then you be walking
back to you car yes

yeah

be there a reason you park so far
away

um
there be lots of car park
on the street

be there anyone else on the street
besides you

no

lots of car but no people
any
traffic

i do not remember

so you be the only person to see
joe on the street that night

i do not see anybody else

so you hear a gunshot a car crash
and a man running with a gun in his
hand

yes

what do you do then
do you call
the police

i go home

you go home
straight home

yes

and you be sure it be joe you see
that night

yes

when you go home

yes

when you go home you see joe

no

objection
defense be trying to
confuse the witness

i be not trying to confuse the witness
it be the witness that be trying to
confuse the court
i have witness
who will refute she testimony
witness who be on that corner
the night of the shoot who never
see ms
webb who never hear the
gunshot who never see joe run past
ms webb see joe outside she apartment
building that night because he live
in the alley next to it
be not that
right ms webb

objection

when i refer to he as joe you
know who i be talking about do not
you
this case be the people versus
mr
william mccall

joe have
never be mention in this trial
how do you know who i be talking
about ms

apartment build
