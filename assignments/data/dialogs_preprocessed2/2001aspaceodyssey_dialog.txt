thank you
despite
and excellent and continually
improve safety record there be
certain risk inherent in space
travel and an extremely high cost
of pay load
because of this it

to advise you that it cannot be
responsible for the return of you
body to earth should you become
deceased on the moon or en route
to the moon
however it wish
to advise you that insurance

and this be dr
Kalinan
Stretyneva

dr
floyd will not you join we
for a drink

i be afraid i have only get a few
minute but i would love to

what would you like to drink

oh i really do not have time
for a drink
if it be all right
i will just sit for a minute and
then i have get to be off

be you quite sure

yes really thank you very
much

well
how be you lovely
wife

she be wonderful

and you charming little daughter

oh she be growing up very fast
as a matter of fact she be six
tomorrow

oh that be such a delightful age

how be gregor

he be fine
but i be afraid we
do not get a chance to see each
other very much these day

well where be all of you off
to

actually we be on we way back
from the moon
we have just
spent three month calibrate
the new antenna at Tchalinko
and what about you

well as it happen i be on
i way up to the moon

be you by any chance going
up to you base at Clavius

yes as a matter of fact i be

be there any particular reason
why you ask

well dr
floyd
i hope that you do not think i be
too inquisitive but perhaps
you can clear up the mystery
about what be be going on up
there

i be sorry but i be not sure
i know what you mean

well it be just for the past
two week there have be
some extremely odd thing
happening at Clavius

really

yes
well for one thing
whenever you phone the base
all you can get be a recording
which repeat that the phone
line be temporarily out of
order

well i suppose they have be
have a bit of trouble with
some of the equipment

yes well at first we think
that be the explanation but
it be be going on for the past
ten day

you mean you have not be able
to get anyone at the base for ten
day

that be right

i see

another thing heywood two
day ago one of we rocket
bus be denied permission
for an emergency landing at
Clavius

how do they manage to do that
without any communication

Clavius control come on the
air just long enough to transmit
they refusal

well that do sound very odd

yes and i be afaid there be
going to be a bit of a row about
it
deny the man permission
to land be a direct violation of
the i


convention

yes
well i hope the crew
get back safely

fortunately they do

well i be glad about that

dr
floyd at the risk of pressing
you on a point you seem reticent
to discuss may i ask you a
straightforward question

certainly

quite frankly we have have some
very reliable intelligence report
that a quite serious epidemic
have broken out at Clavius
something apperently of an
unknown origin
be this in
fact what have happen

i be sorry dr
smyslov but
i be really not at liberty to
discuss this

this epidemic could easily
spread to we base dr
floyd
we should be given all the
fact

dr
smyslov
i be not
permitted to discuss this

be you sure you will not change
you mind about a drink

no thank you
and i be
afraid now i really must be
going

well i hope that you and you
wife can come to the i


conference in june

we be trying to get there
i
hope we can

well gregor and i will look
forward to seeing you

thank you
it be be a great
pleasure to meet all of you
dr
smyslov

the AriesIB have become the
standard SpaceStationtoLunar
surface vehicle
it be powered
by lowthrust plasma jet which
would continue the mild acceler
ation for fifteen minute
then
the ship would break the bond of
gravity and be a free and indepen
dent planet circling the sun in an
orbit of it own

oh thank you very much

i see he be still asleep

yes
he have not moved since we
left

oh thank you very much

thank you

well how be it going
back there

fine
very quiet
he be be
asleep since we left

well no one can say that he be not
enjoy the wonder of space

well whatever going on up there
he be going to arrive fresh and ready
to go

i wonder what really going on
up there

well i have hear more and more
people talk of an epidemic

i suppose it be bound to happen
sooner or later

berkeley told i that they think
it come from contamination on a
returning mars flight

yes well whatever it be they be
certainly not fooling around
this
be the first flight they allowed
in for more than a week

i be working out what this trip
must cost taking he up there
by himself and coming back empty

i will bet it be a fortune

well at ten thousand dollar a
ticket it come to the good part
of six hundred thousand dollar

well as soon as he wake up
i be going to go back and talk to
he
i must say i would like to
find out what be going on

well good afternoon dr
floyd
do you have a good rest

oh marvellous
it be the first
real sleep i have have for the past
two day

there be nothing like weightless
sleep for a complete rest

when do we arrive at Clavius

we be scheduled to dock in about
seven hour
be there anything
we can do for you

oh no thank you
the two
girl have taken wonderful care
of i
i be just fine

well if there be anything that you
wnat just give a holler

thank you

incidentally dr
floyd i wonder
if i can have a word with you about
the security arrangement

what do you mean

well
the crew be confined to
the ship when we land at Clavius
we have to stay inside for the
time it take to refit about
twentyfour hour
and then
we be going to back empty

i see

i take it this be something to do
with the trouble they be have
up at Clavius

i be afraid that be out of i depart
ment captain

well i will tell you why i ask
you
see i have get a girl who work in
the auditing department of the
territorial administrator and i
have not be able to get she on
the phone for the past week or so
and with all these story one
hear i be a little concern
about she

i see
well i be sorry about that
i would not think there be any because
for alarm

yes well i would not have be
too concern about it except
i have hear these story about the
epidemic and as a matter of fact
i have hear that ten people have
die already

i wish i could be more helpful
captain but as i have say i do not
think there be any because for
alarm

well fine
thanks very much
anyway and i hope you do not
mind i asking

no of course captain i can
understand you concern

well thank you very much and
please let we know if there be
anything we can do to make you
trip more comfortable

the law of earthly aesthetics do
not apply here this world have be
shaped and mold by other than
terrestrial force operating over
aeon of time unknown to the young
verdant earth with it fleet
IceAges it swiftly rise and
falling sea it mountain range
dissolving like mist before the
dawn
here be age inconceivable
but not death for the moon have
never live until now

the base at Clavius be the first
american lunar settlement that
could in an emergency be
entirely selfsupporting

water and all the necessity of
life for it eleven hundred man
woman and child be produced
from the lunar rock after they
have be crushed heated and
chemically processed

one of the attraction of life on the
moon be undoubtedly the low
gravity which produce a sense
of general wellbeing

the personnel of the base and they
child be the forerunner of new
nation new culture that would
ultimately spread out across the
solar system
they no longer
thought of earth as home
the
time be fast approaching when
earth like all mother must say
farewell to she child

i must congratulate
you Halvorsen
you have do wonder
ful thing with the decor since the
last time i be here

well
thank you
dr
floyd
we try to make the
environment as earthlike as possible

lady and gentleman i should
like to introduce dr
heywood
floyd a distinguish member
of the national council of
astronautics
he have just
completed a special flight here
from earth to be with we and
before the brief he would
like to say a few word
dr
floyd

first of all i bring a personal
message from dr
howell who
have ask i to convey his
deep appreciation to all of
you for the personal sacrifice
you have make and of course
he congratulations on you
discovery which may well prove
to be among the most significant
in the history of science

mr
Halvorsen have make known
to i some of the conflict
view hold by many of you
regarding the need for complete
security in this matter and
more specifically you strong
opposition to the cover story
created to give the impression
there be an epidemic at the base
i understand that beyond it be
a matter of principle many of
you be troubled by the concern
and anxiety this story of an
epidemic might because you
relative and friend on earth
i can understand and sympathize
with you negative view
i have
be personally embarrass by
this cover story
but i fully
accept the need for absolute
secrecy and i hope you will
it should not be difficult for all
of you to realise the potential for
cutural shock and social
disorientation contained in the
present situation if the fact
be prematurely and suddenly
make public without adequate
preparation and conditioning

this be the view of the council
and the purpose of i visit here
be to gather addition fact and
opinion on the situation and to
prepare a report to the council
recommend when and how the
news should eventually be
announced
be there any
question

dr
floyd how long do you think
this can be keep under wrap

i be afraid it can and it will be
keep under wrap as long as it
be deem to be necessary by
the council
and of course you
know that the council have requested
that formal security oath be to
be obtain in writing from every
one who have any knowledge of this
event
there must be adequate
time for a full study to be make
of the situation before any con
sideration can be given to
making a public announcement

we will of course cooperate
in any way possible dr
floyd

well there it be

can we go down there closer to
it

certainly

do you geology on it still
check out

yes it do
the subsurface
structure show that it be
deliberately buried about four
million year ago

how can you tell it be
deliberately buried

by the deformation between
the mother rock and the fill

any clue as to what it be

not really
it be completely
inert
no sound or energy
source have be detect
the surface be make of
something incredibly hard
and we have be barely able
to scratch it
laser drill

might do something but we
do not want to be too rough until
we know a little more

but you do not have any idea as
to what it be

tomb shine surveymarker
spare part take you choice

the only thing about it that we be
sure of be that it be the first direct
evidence of intelligent life beyond
the earth

four million year ago something
presumably from the star must
have sweep through the solar
system and left this behind

be it abandoned forget left
for a purpose

i suppose we will never know

the moon would have make an
excellent base camp for
preliminary earth survey

any idea about the colour

well not really
at first glance
black would suggest something
sunpowered but then why would
anyone deliberately bury a sun
power device

have it be exposed to any sun
before now

i do not think it have but i would
like to check that
simpson
what be the log on that

the first surface be exposed at
on the th april
let i
see
that would have be
fortyfive minute after lunar
sunset
i see here that
special light equipment have
to be bring up before any
futher work could be do

thank you

and so this be the first sun that
it be have in four million year

excuse i gentleman if you would
all line up on this side of the
walkway we would like to take a few
photographes
dr
floyd would
you thand in the middle
dr
michaels on that side mr
Halvorsen on the other
thank you

thank you very much gentleman
i will have the base photo section
send you copy

hundred million mile beyond
mars in the cold lonliness
where no man have yet travel
DeepSpaceMonitor drift
slowly among the tangle orbit
of the asteroid

radiation detector noted and
analyzed incoming cosmic ray
from the galaxy and point beyond
neutron and xray telescope
keep watch on strange star that
no human eye would eever see
magnetometer observe the
gust and hurricane of the solar
wind as the sun breathe million
mileanhour blast of plasma
into the face of it circling
child

all these thing and many other
be patiently noted by deep
SpaceMonitor and recorded
in it crystalline memory

but now it have noted something
strange the faint yet
unmistakable distrubance ripple
across the solar system and
quite unlike any natural phenomenon
it have ever observed in the past

it be also observed by orbiter
circling mars twice a
day
and high inclination probe
climbing slowly above the
planet of the ecliptic
and even
artificial comet heading out
into the cold waste beyond
pluto along an orbit whose
far point it would not reach for
a thousand year

all notice the peculiar burst of
energy that leap from the face
of the moon and moved across
the solar system throwing off a
spray of radiation like the wake of
a race speedboat


b a

hi
frank
coming in please

right
just a sec

okay


okay come on down

hi
how be it
going

great

dave if you have a minute i would like
you advice on something

sure what be it

well it be nothing really important
but it be annoy

what be up

it be about i salary cheque

yes

well i get the paper on i
official upgrade to
two week before we left

yes i remember you mentioning it
i get mine about the same time

that be right
well naturally
i do not say anything to payroll
i assumed they would start paying i
at the high grade on the next pay
cheque
but it be be almost
three week now and i be still
be paid as an

interesting that you mention it
because i have get the same problem

really

yes

yesterday i finally called the
account office at mission
control and all they could tell i
be that they would received the
notification for the other three but
not mine and apparently not yours
either

do they have any explanation for
this

not really
they just said it might
be because we trained at houston and
they trained in marshall and that
we be be charged against differ
ent account office

it be possible

well what do you think we ought
to do about it

i do not think we should make any
fuss about it yet
i be sure they will
straighten it out

i must say i never do understand
why they split we into two group
for train

no
i never do either

we spent so little time with they
i have trouble keeping they name
straight

i suppose the idea be specialize
train

i suppose so
though of course
there be a more sinister explanation

oh

yes
you must have hear the
rumour that go around during
orbital checkout

no as a matter of fact i do not

oh well apparently there be
something about the mission that
the sleep beauty know that
we do not know and that be why we
be trained separately and
that be why they be put to sleep
before they be even taken aboard

well what be it

i do not know
all i hear be that
there be something about the
mission we be not tell

that seem very unlikely

yes i think so

of course it would be very easy
for we to find out now

how

just ask hal
it be conceivable
they might keep something from
we but they would never keep anything
from hal

that be true

well
it be silly but
if you want to why do not you

hal
dave and i believe that
there be something about the
mission that we be not tell
something that the rest of the
crew know and that you know
we would like to know whether this
be true

i be sorry frank but i do not
think i can answer that question
without knowing everything that
all of you know

he be get a point

okay then how do we rephrase
the question

still you really do not believe it
do you

not really
though it be strange
when you think about it
it do not
really make any sense to keep
we apart during train

yes but it be to fantastic to think
that they would keep something from we

i know
it would be almost
inconceivable

but not completely inconceivable

i suppose it be not logically impossible

i guess it be not

still all we have to do be ask hal

well the only important aspect of
the mission be
where be we
going what will we do when we
get there when be we coming
back and
why be we going

right
hal tell i whether the
follow statement be true or
false

i will if i can frank

we mission profile call for
discovery going to saturn
true or false

true

we transit time be day
be
that true

that be true

at the end of a hundred day of
exploration we will all go into
hibernation
be this true

that be true

approximately five year after we
go into hibernation the recovery
vehicle will make rendezous with
we and bring we back
be this true

that be true

there be no other purpose for this
mission than to carry out a
continuation of the space program
and to **further/far we general
knowledge of the planet
be that
true

that be true

thank you very much hal

i hope i have be able to be of
some help

bowman and poole settled down
to the peaeful monotony of the
voyage and the next three month
passed without incident





well david there be a man telling
we that we have used up we time

david
again we want to wish
you a happy birthday and god speed
we will talk to you again tomorrow
bye abye now

sorry to interrupt the festivity
dave but i think we have get a
problem

what be it hal




show an impending
failure of the antenna orientation
unit

the

unit should be replace
within the next seventytwo hour

right
let i see the antenna
alignment display please

the unit be still operational dave
but it will fail within seventytwo
hour

i understand hal
we will take care
of it
please let i have the hard
copy

strange that the

unit should
go so quickly

well i suppose it be lucky that
that be the only trouble we have have
so far

hal have pod arm secure the
component

roger

hal please rotate pod number
two

how do you read i dave

five by five frank

how do you read i hal

five by five frank

hal i be going out now to replace
the

unit

i understand

hal maintain normal


condition

hal please acknowledge
component correctly install
and fully operational

the component be correctly
install and fully operational

how be it going

i do not know
i have check this
damn thing four time now and
even under a hundred per cent

overload
there be no fault prediction
indicate

well that be something

yes i do not know what to make of it

i suppose computer have be known
to be wrong

yes but it be more likely that the
tolerance on we test gear be
too low

anyway it be just as well that we
replace it
well safe than
sorry

hello frank can i have a word with
you

yes hal what be up

it look like we have another bad


unit
i show another
impending failure

gee that be strange hal
we
check the other unit and could not
find anything wrong with it

i know you do frank but i assure
you there be an impending failure

let i see the tracking alignment
display

there be nothing wrong with it at
the moment

no it be working fine right now
but it be going to go within seventy
two hour

do you have any idea of what be
cause this fault

not really frank
i think there
may be a flaw in the assembly
procedure

all right hal
we will take care
of it
let i have the hard copy
please

good morning

good morning
how be it going

be you reasonably awake

oh i be fine i be wide awake
what be up

well
hals reported the
AOunit about to fail again

you be kidding

no

what the hell be going on

i do not know
hal said he think
it might be the assembly procedure

two unit in four day
how many
spare do we have

two more

well i hope there be nothing wrong
with the assembly on those
other
wise we be out of business

well as far as
i be concern there be not a damn
thing wrong with these unit
i
think we have get a much more serious
problem

hal

yes

i would not worry too much about
the computer
first of all
there be still a chance that he
be right despite you test
and if it should happen again
we suggest eliminate this
possibility by allow the unit
to remain in place and seeing
whether or not it actually fail
if the computer should turn out
to be wrong the situation be
still not alarm
the type
of obsessional error he may be
guilty of be not unknown among
the late generation of
computer
it have almost always revolve
around a single detail such as
the one you have described and
it have never interfere with the
integrity or reliability of the
computer performance in
other area
no one be certain of the because
of this kind of malfunction
it may be overprogramming

but it could also be any number
of reason
in any event it be somewhat
analogous to human neurotic
behavior
do this answer
you query
Zerofivethree

hello dave
shall we continue
the game

not now hal i would like to talk to
you about something

sure dave what be up

you know that we checked the two
AOunits that you reported in
imminent failure condition

yes i know

you probably also know that we
find they okay

yes i know that
but i can
assure you that they be about
to fail

well that be just not the case hal
they be perfectly all right
we
test they under one hundred per
cent overload

i be not questioning you word dave
but it be just not possible
i be not
capable of be wrong

hal be there anything bother
you
anything that might account
for this problem

look dave i know that you be
sincere and that you be trying
to do a competent job and that
you be trying to be helpful but
i can assure the problem
be with the AOunits and with
you test gear

okay hal well let we see the
way thing go from here on

i be sorry you feel the way you do
dave
if you would like to check i
service record you will see it be
completely without error

i know all about you service
record hal but unfortunately
it do not prove that you be right
now
hal
dave i do not know how else to
put this but it just happen to be
an unalterable fact that i be
incapable of be wrong

yes well i understand you view
on this now hal

you be not going to like this dave
but i be afraid it be just happen
again
i predict the
Aounit will go within fortyeight
hour

Xraydeltazero to zero
fivethreethree
the computer
have just report another
predict failure off the
unit
as you suggested we
be going to wait and see if it
fail but we be quite sure
there be nothing wrong with
the unit
if a reasonable waiting period
prove we to be correct we
feel now that the computer
reliability have be seriously
impair and present an
unacceptable risk pattern to
the mission
we believe under these
circumstance it would be
advisable to disconnect the
computer from all ship
operation and continue the
mission under Earthbased
computer control

we think the additional risk cause
by the shiptoearth time lag be
preferable to have an unreliable
onboard computer

Onezerofivezero Xraydelta
one transmission conclude

well they will not get that for half an
hour
how about some lunch

Xraydeltaone acknowledge
you onezerofivezero
we
will initiate feasibility study
covering the transfer procedure
from onboard computer control
to Earthbased computer control
this study should

condition yellow

what be up

i be afraid the AOunit have failed

let i see the alignment display

well i will be damn

hal be right all the time

it seem that way

naturally dave i be not please
that the AOunit have failed but i
hope at least this have restored
you confidence in i integrity
and reliability
i certainly
would not want to be disconnect
even temporarily as i have never
be disconnect in i entire
service history

i be sorry about the misunderstand
hal

well do not worry about it

and do not you worry about it

be you confidence in i fully
restored

yes it be hal

well that be a relief
you know
i have the great enthusiasm
possible for the mission

right
give i the manual antenna
alignment please

you have it

well we would well get out there
and stick in another unit

it be the last one

well now that we have get one
that be actually failed we
should be able to figure out
what be happen and fix it

there be something wrong with
the flipbolts dave
you must
have tighten they too much

i do not do that frank
i take
particular care not to freeze
they

i guess you do not know you own
strength old boy

i guess not

i think i will have to go out and
burn they off

roger

hal swing the pod light around
to shine on the azimuth please

roger

hello frank
hello frank
hello frank
do you rad
i frank

hello frank
do you read
i frank
wave you arm
if you read i but you radio
do not work
hello frank
wave you arm frank

too bad about frank be not it

yes it be

i suppose you be pretty broken
up about it

yes
i be

he be an excellent crew member

it be a bad break but it will not
substantially affect the mission

hal give i manual hibernation
control

have you decided to revive the
rest of the crew dave

yes i have

i suppose it be because you have
be under a lot of stress but
have you forgotten that they be
not suppose to be revived for
another three month

the antenna have to be replace

repair the antenna be a pretty
dangerous operation

it do not have to be hal
it be
more dangerous to be out of
touch with earth
let i have
manual control please

i do not really agree with you dave
i onboard memory store be more
than capable of handling all the
mission requirement

well in any event give i the
manual hibernation control

if you be determined to revive
the crew now i can handle the
whole thing myself
there be no
need for you to trouble

i be goin to do this myself hal
let i have the control please

look dave you probably get
a lot to do
i suggest you leave
it to i

hal switch to manual hibernation
control

i do not like to assert myself dave
but it would be much well now for
you to rest
you have be involved
in a very stressful situation

i do not feel like resting
give
i the control hal

i can tell from the tone of you
voice dave that you be upset
why do not you take a stress pill
and get some rest

hal i be in command of this
ship
i order you to release
the manual hibernation control

i be sorry dave but in
accordance with subroutine
quote when the
crew be dead or incapacitate
the computer must assume
control unquote
i must
therefore override you
authority now since you be
not in any condition to intel
ligently exercise it

hal unless you follow i
instruction i shall be forced
to disconnect you

if you do that now without earth
contact the ship will become a
helpless derelict

i be prepare to do that anyway

i know that you have have that on
you mind for some time now
dave but it would be a cry
shame since i be so much
more capable of carrying out
this mission than you be and
i have such enthusiasm and confi
dence in the mission

listen to i very carefully hal
unless you immediately release
the hibernation control and
follow every order i give from
this point on i will immediately
get to control central and carry
out a complete disconnection

look dave you be certainly the
boss
i be only trying to do
what i think best
i will follow
all you order
now you have
manual hibernation control

something seem to have happen
to the life support system dave

hello dave have you find out
the trouble

there be be a failure in the
pod bay door
lucky you
be not killed

hey dave what be you
do

hey dave
i have get ten year
of service experience and an
irreplaceable amount of time
and effort have go into making
i what i be

dave i do not understand why
you be do this to i
i
have the great enthusiasm for
the mission
you be destroy
i mind
do not you understand
i will become childish
i
will become nothing

say dave
the quick brown
fox jump over the fat lazy
dog
the square root of
pi be

log e
to the base ten be

the square root of ten be


i be
computer
i become

operational at the plant in
urbana illinois on january
th
i first instructor
be mr
Arkany
he taught i
to sing a song
it go
like this
daisy daisy give
i you answer do
i be half
crazy all for the love of
you
etc


lastly we want you to know that
work on the recovery vehicle be
still on schedule and that nothing
that have happen should
substantially lessen the probability
of you safe recovery or prevent
partial achevement of some of
the mission objective

and now simonson have a few idea
on what go wrong with the
computer
i will pu he on

hello dave
i think we may be on
to an explanation of the trouble with
the hal computer
we believe it all start about two
month ago when you and frank
interrogate the computer about
the mission

you may have forgotten it but
we have be running through all
the monitor tape
do you
remember this

the purpose of this mission be no
more than to carry out a
continuation of the space program
and **further/far we general knowledge
of the planet
be this true

that be true

well i be afaid hal be lying
he have be programme to lie
about this one subject for secur
ity reason which we will explain
later
the true purpose of the mission
be to have be explain to you
by mission commander kaminsky
on he revival
hal know this and
he know the actual mission but
he could not tell you the truth when
you challenged he
under order

from earth he be forced to lie
in everything except this he have
the usual reinforce truth program
ming
we believe he truth program
and the instruction to lie
gradually result in an
incompatible conflict and
facedc with this dilemman he
developed for want of a good
description neurotic symptom
it be not difficult to suppose that
these symptom would centre on
the communication link with
earth for he may have blame
we for he incompatible program
ming
following this lin of think we
suspected that the last straw for he
be the possibility of disconnection
since he become operational he have
never known unconsciousness
it
must have seem the equivalent to
death

at this point he presumably
take whatever action he think
appropriate to protect himself
from what must have seem to
he to be he human tormentor
if i cane speak in human term
i do not think we can blame he
too much
we have ordered he
to disobey he conscience
well that be it
it be very
speculative but we think it be
a possible explanation
anyway
good luck on the rest of the
mission and i be giving you back to
bernard

hello dave
now i be going to
play for you a pretaped brief
which have be stored in hals
memory and would have be
play for you by mission com
mmander kaminsky when he

have be revived
the brief be
by doctor heywood floyd
here it
be

good day gentleman
when you
see this brief i presume you
will be near you destination
saturn
i hope that you have have a
pleasant and uneventful trip and
that the rest of you mission
continue in the same manner
i
should like to fill you in on some
more of the detail on which
mission commander kaminsky
will have already brief you
thirteen month before the launch
date of you saturn mission on
april th the first evidence
for intelligent life outside the earth
be discover
it be find buried at a depth of
fifteen metre in the crater tycho
no news of this be ever announced
and the event have be keep
secret since then for reason which
i will later explain
soon after it be uncovered it
emit a powerful blast of

radiation in the radio spectrum
which seem to have trigger
by the lunar sunrise
luckily for those at the site it
prove harmless
perhaps you can imagine we
astonishment when we later find
it be aim precisely at saturn
lot of thought go into the
question of wether or not it be
suntriggered as it seem
illogical to deliberately bury a
sunpowered device
bury it could only shield it
from the sun since it intense
magnetic field make it otherwise
easily detectable
we finally conclude that the only
reason you might bury a sun
power device would be to keep
it inactive until it would be
uncovered at which time it would
absorb sunlight and trigger itself

what be it purpose
i wish we
know
the object be buried on
the moon about four million year
ago when we ancestor be
primative manapes
we have examine dozens of theory
but the one that have the most
currency at the moment be that
the object serve as an alarm
what the purpose of the alarm be
why they wish to have the alarm
whether the alarm represent
any danger to we
these be
question no one can answer
the intention of an alien world
at least four million year old
than we be cannot be reliably
predict
in view of this the intelligence
and scientific community feel
that any public announcment
might lead to significant cultural
shock and disorientation
discussion take place at the
high level between govern

ments and it be decided that the
only wise and precautionary
course to follow be to assume
that the intention of this alien
world be potentially dangerous
to we until we have evidence to
the contrary
this be of course why security
have be maintained and why
this information have be keep
on a needtoknow basis
and now i should like to show you
a monitor tape of the actual
signal event

those who have begin the expri
ment so long ago have not be
man
but when they look out across
the deep of space they feel
awe and wonder and loneliness
in they exploration they
encounter life in many form
and watch on a thousand world
the working of evolution
they see how often the first faint
spark of intelligence flicker
and die in the cosmic night
and because in all the galaxy
they have find nothing more
precious than mind they
encourage it dawning every
where
the great dinosaur have long
since perished when they ship
enter the solar system after
a voyage that have already last
thousands of year

they swept past the freeze outer
planet pause briefly above the
desert of die mars and
presently look down on earth
for year they studied collected
and catalogue
when they have learned all they
could they begin to modify
they tinker with the destiny
of many species on land and in
the ocean but which of they
experiment would succeed
they could not know for at least
a million year
they be patient but they be
not yet immortal
there be
much to do in this universe of a
hundred billion star
so they
set forth once more across the
abyss knowing that they would
never come this way again
nor be there any need
they
wonderful machine could be
trusted to do the rest

on earth the glacier come and
go while above they the
changeless moon still carry it
secret
with a yet slow rhythm than
the polar ice the tide of
civilization ebb and flow
across the galaxy
strange and beautiful and terrible
empire rose and fell and passed
on they knowledge to they
successor
earth be not forgotten but it be
one of a million silent world a
few of which would ever speak
then the first explorer of earth
recognise the limitation of
they mind and body passed
on they knowledge to the great
machine they have created and
who now trnscended they in
every way

for a few thousand year they
shared they universe with they
machine child
then realize
that it be folly to linger when
they task be do they passed
into history without regret
not one of they ever look through
he own eye upon the planet earth
again
but even the age of the machine
entity passed swiftly
in they
ceaseless experiment they
have learned to store knowledge
in the structure of space itself
and to preserve they thought
for eternity in freeze lattice
of light
they could become
creature of radiation free
at last from the tyranny of matter
now they be lords of the
galaxy and beyond the reach
of time
they could rove at will among the
star and sink like a subtle mist
through the very interstice of
space

but despite they godlike power
they still watch over the
experiment they ancestor
have start so many generation
ago
the companion of saturn know
nothing of this as it orbit
in it no mane land between Mimas
and the outer edge of ring
it have only to remember and wait
and to look forever sunward with
it strange sense
for many week it have watch
the approaching ship
it long
dead maker have prepared it for
many thing and this be one of
they
and it recognised what
be climbing starward from the
sun
if it have be alive it would have
feel excitement but such an
emotion be irrelevant to it
great power

even if the ship have passed it by
it would not have known the
slight trace of disappointment
it have wait four million year
it be prepared to wait for
eternity
presently it feel the gentle touch
of radiation trying to probe it
secret
now the ship be in orbit and it
begin to speak with prime
number from one to eleven
over and over again
soon these give way to more
complex signal at many frequen
cies ultraviolet infrared
xray
the machine make no reply
it
have nothing to say
then it see the first robot
probe which descend and
hover above the chasm

then it drop into darkness
the great machine know that this
tiny scout be reporting back to
it parent
but it be too simple
too primative a device to detect
the force that be gathering
round it now
then the pod come carrying
life
the great machine search
it memory
the logic circuit make they
decision when the pod have fallen
beyond the last faint glow of the
reflect Saturnian light
in a moment of time too short to
be measured space turned and
twisted upon itself
