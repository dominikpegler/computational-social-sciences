i have wonder if he ever do
anything like that before

why
have he say anything

no
but a man who do a thing
like that have often developed a
taste for it over time
occur
to i it might be easy enough to
follow he backtrail and find out
man he size and colore to
boot can not be that hard to trace

you would think so but you would be
wrong
believe i we tried
it be
like he drop out of the sky

how do you explain that

we be in a depression
third of
the country out of work
people be drifting by the
thousands looking for work
looking for that green grass
even a giant like coffey would not
get notice everywhere he go
not until he kill a couple of
little girl

he be
strange i admit
but there
do not seem to be any real
violence in he
i know violent
man mr
hammersmith
i deal with
they day in and day out

you do not come up here to ask i
whether he might have killed
before
you come up here to see if
i think he do it at all
that be
it be not it

do you

one seldom see a less ambiguous
case
he be find with the
victim in he arm
blurt out
a confession right then and there

yet you defend he

everyone be entitle to a defense

kid
lunch

you all listen to you momma now

tell you something
you listen
close too because it might be
something you need to know

i be listening

we have we a dog
no particular
breed but gentle
ready to lick
you hand or fetch a stick
just
a sweet mongrel you know the kind
in many way a good mongrel dog be
like you negro
you get to know
it and often you get to love it
it be of no particular use but
you keep it around because you
think it love you
if you be
lucky mr
Edgecomb you never
have to find out any different
i
wife and i be not so lucky
caleb
come here for a second

please son

he have the one eye
i suppose he be
lucky not to be blind
we get down
on we knee and thank god for
that much at least
right caleb
okay go on in now

that dog attacked i boy for no
reason
just get it into he mind
one day
same with john coffey
he
be sorry afterwards of that i
have no doubt
but those little
girl stay raped and murdered
nonetheless
maybe he be never do
it beforemy dog never bit
before but i do not concern
myself with that
i go out there
with i rifle and grab his
collar and blow he brain out

i be sorry for you trouble

i be as enlighten as the next
man mr
Edgecomb
i would not
bring back slavery for all the tea
in china
i believe we have to be
humane and generous in we effort
to solve the race problem
but we
have to remember that the negro
will bite if he get the chance
just like a mongrel dog will bite
if it cross it mind to do so
be coffey guilty

do not you doubt it and do not you
turn you back on he
