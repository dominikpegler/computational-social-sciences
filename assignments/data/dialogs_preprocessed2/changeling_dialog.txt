child
it be i son he

how long have he be go

i be sorry but we policy be that
we do not dispatch unit on missing
child case for twentyfour hour

what
but that be

Ninetynine time out of a hundred
the kid show up by morning
we
do not have the resource to go
chasing every kid who run off with
he pal and

that be not walter he do not do
that

with all due respect madam every
parent who call we say the same
thing

please i

i be sorry but there be nothing i
can do
i will take you name and
information but that be all until
tomorrow morning at the early



i be sure he will show up by then
they always do




we thought go out again to mrs
christine collins of lincoln height




whose young son walter collins
disappeared almost two week ago


though she be not a member of we
congregation we pray for she today


as we have every day since we first
learned of she situation on the
radio and in the newspaper
we be tell that the los angeles
police department be do the good
it can to reunite mother and child
and i be sure that be true
but given it position as the most
violent corrupt and incompetent
police department this side of the
rocky mountains that be not saying
a great deal


every day new body show up along
mulholland or in ditch the work
of police chief james davis and he
socalled gun squad
every day
the need of honest citizen be
put second to greed and personal
gain
every day the city sink
deeper into a cesspool of fear
intimidation and corruption
once
the city of angel los angeles be
now a place where we protector
have become we brutalizers
where
to be the law
be to be above the
law
where none dare speak truth
to power
but we will not be silent
we will
continue to put they offense and
they failure in full view of the
public
we will not be intimidated


because while the gun squad speak
in the only language chief davis
understand we speak in the language
of compassion truth and strength
we speak for we fellow citizen
beaten and killed by a renegade
police department


we speak for an innocent child
ripped from he mother arm now
all but forgotten by the police
and that voice i friend will
never be silence





be you sure you be ready for this
christine


i mean if you need more time

the police be do all they can
and frankly i could use the money
it be be almost a month and
it
would not do any good to find walter
and bring he home if he do not
have a home to come back to right


of course


well
i will leave you to it then

excuse i can i have you attention

consideration but i be not make of
porcelain
i will not break down and
cry if the station to station call

would not let myself
cry
until i know one way or
another what
point be
i like the noise here
so do not be afraid to talk and
push
button and drop thing
if it
be not noisy how would i know i
be in the right place

you son be miss
for four month
for at least part
of that in the company of an asyet

you have both be through
a terrible experience

rubber and drop he off the roof

why be you do this mrs
collins
you seem perfectly capable of taking
care of the boy you work pay you
enough to attend to he personal
need
so i do not understand why
you be trying to run away from you
responsibility

i be not running away from anything
least of all i responsibility
i be even taking care of that boy
because right now i be all he have
what worry i be that you have
stopped looking for walter

why should we look someone we have
already find

but you have not find he
he be
still out there somewhere lost
maybe hurt

he identity have be confirmed by
the good mind in the field of child
identification people who know
what they be do

and i do not
captain look i do not
want to because trouble for you or
the department

mistake and i need you help if
we be going to correct it

sara get dr
tarr on the phone


mrs
collins
dr
earl
tarr
captain jones send i
i consult
with he from time to time on
juvenile case
may i come in

oh
yes of course

thank you for coming
i be surprise
captain jones moved so quickly
i
be starting to think he do not
believe i


well i be here now and we will put
all that to right
where be the
boy


ah
there he be
handsome young
man
he have you eye do not he
and a little bit of the nose
very
fit in spite of all he travail
very resilient boy you have get
here mrs
collins

doctor tarr i think you be
here to help i


i be
captain jones said the boy
have go through some extreme
physical change and ask i to
look in on he
to reassure you in
this you time of motherly concern

i motherly concern be not for he
because he be not i son


statement like that will hardly
help the boyo selfesteem now
will they
captain jones said something about
a change in height

he be four inch short than


ah well
hardly a mystery mrs
collins
we have known for some time
that trauma can affect the growth
of child
given the stress of
the last four month he spine may
have actually shrink
it be uncommon
but within the realm of possibility

what about the circumcision


very likely he abductor think it
appropriate
after all circumcision
be hygienically sound
must have
be quite traumatic at the time
no wonder he be submerged the memory

look doctor


as you can see there be a perfectly
sound medical explanation for all
of this
but it be good for you to
raise these question
you should
be apprised of all change the lad
go through during he absence

would not i know whether or not he
be i son
i be he mother


which mean you be in no position
to be objective
you be looking
through the prism of extreme emotion
at a boy who have changed from what
you remember
he be not the same
boy that left here just as a boy
who go off to war and return
be not the same anymore


mother heart driven by intuition
and emotion rather than logic see
these change and rebel insist
that this cannot be you son
but
that do not change the fact
i be will to put i theory to the
test of objectivity mrs
collins
be you

what be you


hello child i name be dr
earl
tarr
i would like to ask you
some question

i mom say we be not suppose to
talk to stranger


good boy
quite right
but as you
see i be with the police so it be
all right
now i be sure you know
mrs
collins here and she son
walter
how many of you recognize
this young boy as walter collins


now now no need to be afraid
surely you know walter and play
with he
so which of you can
identify walter for i for his
mother and for the police
this
officer would want you to do the
right thing as good young citizen

walter be as tall as i


yes precisely
he be as tall as
you
now he be not
he be lost a
little height you see
it be a
thing called trauma
with luck
none of you will ever have to find
out about it yourselves
so other
than that do you recognize this as
you friend walter collins

i guess

dr
tarr


already ahead of you mrs
collins
child can be intimidated
but
not adult
shall we try a neighbor


and we would appreciate it if you
could make a positive identification
for we


i would be happy to
i see the boy
often
come close son


take you time
be sure


oh yes
yes
that be walter all
right
used to come here all the
time to play with i nephew roger


thank you mrs
riley
you have be
a big help i

before we go
mrs
riley do you
have the time


certainly


i last concession to vanity
man
do not make pass at woman who wear
glass you know
five of the clock

thank you


boy be much large than a watch
mrs
collins
come along son



this be absolutely outrageous

captain i
no listen to i this
socalled doctor parade i around
i own neighborhood like some kind
of derelict mother who could not
even recognize she own
he find what he expect to find
what you obviously told he he would
find but it be not
no i be not reassured

i think we have an understand
i
that i be embarrass be not the
issue the point be you be wasting
time when you should be looking for
i son i
then i want to see this report so
i can refute it before it go to
anyone else all right
fine

i be finished
can i go to i room
now

yes
go on up

night mommy

stop saying that
i be not you
mother
and you be not i son





i


i want i son back
god please
make it stop
just make it stop

i be wrong to yell at you
you be
still a child and i think you do not
really understand what you be do
the hurt you be cause
maybe
this be all just some big game of
pretend to you but i need you to
understand
walter be
he be all i
have he be everything to i and
every day we lose because of this
put he **further/far away from where i
can help he
whatever the police think whatever
the world think we know the truth
do not we
we both know you be not
walter
get you to admit that
may be the only chance i have to
straighten this out before it be too
late
maybe you be afraid of get
in trouble that you be in too deep
but you be not
you do not have to
tell i who you be you just have
to tell they who you be not
just
tell they the truth

have you see the
time today

no i


you would well take a look
then
come by the parish in an hour for
breakfast
i think we should meet

act on the request of the los
angeles police department dr
earl


tarr child specialist examine
walter collins to determine the
because of he loss of weight
paleness confusion and rundown
condition notice since the return
of the boy to he mother last
saturday



lovely bit of phrasing be not it
notice since the return of the boy
to he mother
not only do it
state clearly that you be the boyo
mother one could infer from this
that you be somehow responsible
for these change
and that the
police be concern for the boyo
welfare in you hand
you should try the egg they be
very good

i examine the boy quite thoroughly
dr
tarr said


and it be clear that he have
something to tell
i be sure that
in time he will give he boyish
story of the entire affair but not
until he have faith in he listener
and that be what be lacking
faith
in the poor lades story
in the
course of i examination i find
nothing to dispute the finding by
the

how come he have not be able to
tell anyone what happen while he
be go


i would say that the boy have either
be coach or question to a
point where he be largely confuse
about what happen to he during


those many month
it be possible
that he mental lapse may be the
result of a blow to the head or a
sudden shock which bring about a
possible cranial injury
i believe
that this condition will pass soon
until then i recommend that the
police department continue work
with he expose he to whatever
element of he previous life as
may help restore he memory

captain jones promised he would let i
see the report before it go
anywhere else


someone in authority at the
lie
good heaven i may have to
go lie down


i be not laughing at you situation
mrs
collins
it be just
after
one have this sort of conversation
enough time a certain degree of
hysteria begin to set in
please
sit

why be they do this


to avoid admitting a mistake
that
they bring back the wrong boy
anyone reading that with half a
brain would see through it instantly
sadly that leaf out about half
the time readership but still

thank you

i have be trying to get someone to
say those word since
god i be
starting to think i be losing i
mind
thank you
at least someone believe
i


you have no idea how many people
have sit in that very chair and
said those exact same word to i
in relation to we friend at the
los angeles police department
mrs
collins i have make it i
mission to bring to light all the
thing the would prefer no one
know anything about
a department
ruled by violence abuse murder
corruption and intimidation




when chief davis take over the
two year ago he said

we will hold court on gunman in the
los angeles street
i want they
bring in dead not alive and i
will reprimand any officer who show
the least mercy to a criminal




he picked fifty of the most dangerous
cop on the force give they machine
gun and permission to shoot anyone
who get in they way
he called
they the gun squad
no lawyer
no trial
no question suspension
or investigation
just pile of
body




body in morgues body in
hospital body by the side of
the road barely alive
not because
the police wanted to wipe out crime
they just wanted to get rid of the
competition




mayor cryer and half the police
force be on the take
prostitution
gamble bootlegging you name it
when the glove come off pretty
soon the rest of the department get
into the brutality act
do not
want the gun squad to have all the
fun after all




the more they get away with it the
bad thing get because when you
give folk the freedom to do whatever
they want as god see in the garden
of eden they will do just that


this police department do not
tolerate dissent contradiction
or embarrassment mrs
collins
you have the power to embarrass
they
and they do not like it
not
when they become the hero of the
hour the day they stand there posing
with you have rescue a lose boy
from the wilderness


they will do everything they can to
discredit you
i have see it happen
too many time to start going blind
now
that be why i wanted to see
you so you would know what you be
get into
and how to fight
they

reverend Briegleb
i appreciate
what you be saying and what you be
do
but i be not on a mission
the only thing i want be to find i
son that be all and i just


lot of mother son end up
be sacrifice to expediency around
here mrs
collins
yours would not
be the first
do this right and
maybe yours will be the last

if they honestly think i be wrong
that would be one thing
but if they
do not care if they be just trying
to cover it up


this be they attempt to win by
frame the discussion they way
why of course it be she son
yes
there have be change
we be
looking into it and be not it strange
that they happen after the boy
get home

they be putting you in the position
of have to disprove what they be
saying
and that be hard
most
people believe what they hear from
the police or the government
if
you play it they way you
and
you son
be going to lose

what do i have to do


change the rule of engagement
re
define the argument
they bring
in they expert so you bring in
yours
you have an advantage they
do not
you know you son well
than they ever will and in that
knowledge be the proof you need
get that information put it out
there
make they respond to you
not the other way around


once people side with the police
it be a hard climb
but even in a
town as loud as this one the voice
of truth can be hear
if you be
will to take it all the way in
spite of the danger
and they be
very real mrs
collins make no
mistake
once you open the book on
these people you be going to be
looking over you shoulder every
day maybe for the rest of you
life
you up to it mrs
collins

well


he have two cavity that needed
fill
he put up a fight but i
take care of it

and


you sones upper front tooth be
separated by a small muscle
make
they sit about an eighth of an inch
apart
the boy in that room have no
such gap

do a gap like that get small
with age
because that be what
they will say


in some case yes it be possible
but the muscle between walters
tooth prevent that from happening
they can never come together without
an operation to sever the muscle
and i can tell you right now that
he have never have such an operation

will you be will to sign a letter
saying that officially


pardon i language but
hell
yes


sound like the anesthetic be wearing
off
on the other hand maybe i will write
that letter first
give the little
fella something to think about

well
what do you think
be that
the walter collins that you remember


if it be he be changed enormously
do you know who i be

as i can talk to a doctor they will
realize there be be a terrible

yeah that always work
i hear they talking
you be here
on a code twelve police action
the doctor the staff they figure
that if the police send you here
there must be a good reason for it

then i will just have to prove that
i be not insane

yeah
how
the more you try to
act sane the crazy you start to
look
if you smile too much you be
delusional or stifle hysteria
if you do not smile you be depress
if you be neutral you be emotionally
withdraw and potentially catatonic

you seem to have given this a great
deal of thought

i have
do not you get it
you be
code twelve
so be i
we be here
for the same reason
we pissed off the cop

what you think you be the only
one
the lady over there be marry to
a cop who keep beating she up
when she tried to tell somebody
they send she here
and that one
the police beat the crap out of she
brother broke both he arm
when
she complain to the paper they
picked she up and

what about you

i
work night
i mean i work night
downtown
in some of the club
you know

this one client start hitting i
and he would not stop
so i file a
complaint
turn out he be a cop
next thing i know i be here

but how can they

you be kidding right
hey everybody
know woman be fragile right
they be all emotion no logic
nothing going on upstairs
and
sometimes like when they say
something that be a little know
inconvenient
they just go fucking
nut pardon i french
if we be
insane nobody have to listen to we
i mean who be you going to believe
some crazy woman trying to destroy
the integrity of the force or a
police officer
then once they get
we in here we either learn to
behave and shut up or
or you do not go home
or you go
home like that

well finish up you oatmeal
want to look sane for the doctor
then i want to hear what they nail
you for

clark
sanford clark

paperwork come through
you will
be deported back to canada day after
tomorrow
the police there will to
decide what to do with you next
i
hope you stay here have convinced
you not to try crossing the border
illegally in future

wait i
i want to talk to the
officer who bring i in

i be sure he have far more important
thing to do than

please
it be important

he be offduty until tomorrow but
i will see what i can do
no promise

how far you going

vancouver

hop in

do not worry about that pal
just
a little insurance
couple of
guy tried to hijack i truck a few
year ago so they could run booze
over the border
you can not be too
safe you know

yeah i surely do

mrs
collins
dr
jonathan steele
please have a seat

i hope you stay have be comfortable
so far

fine
thank you

really
i would think it would be quite
difficult at first

well it be
difficult i mean
but comfortable

i see they take a blood test

wasserman test
to check for
syphilis
apparently it can affect
the mind

the idea that someone think you
should be check for syphilis
do
that upset you

no
not at all
i be sure it be
standard procedure

yes
exactly
standard procedure
we have to cover all base and

but
at the same time
i imagine
that it would be
would probably
be upsetting to
some people that
someone else might
suspect that
of they
however inappropriate that might
be

accord to you file you believe
the police have substitute a fake
boy for you son
be that true

i do not say they substitute a fake
boy just
not the right boy
they bring back the wrong boy
not i son
he be still miss

that be strange
you see i have
here a newspaper article with a
photo of you at the train station
welcoming you son home
that be
you in the photo be not it

yes

so at first he be you son but
now he be not you son
have this be going on for a long
time
people
changing becoming
something other than what they be

people do not change doctor

you do not think people change

that be not what i

and the police
they be not out to
persecute you

no
of course not

the police be here to protect we

that be right

that be odd because accord to
the head nurse when you be
admit you accused the police of
conspire to do this deliberately
to punish you
so either she and
the interns be also conspire
against you
or you be changing
you story
do you often have trouble telling
reality from fantasy mrs
collins

i be sorry to bring you out in this
weather detective but the boy have
be quite insistent

it be all right i will just see what
he have to say so i can go home and
get dry
where be he

room seven

it be rain cat dog and democrat
out there so this well be worth
it

well

look i this be not easy okay

nothing be

i cousin gordon northcott
he
own the ranch where you find i
he let i live there in exchange
for watch the place when he be
go doing chore stuff like that
say i could stay on as long as i
wanted to
i figure that also
mean i could leave whenever i wanted
to but he would not let i

be you saying he held you prisoner
bull
when i get to the ranch you
be running around free as a
jaybird
could have left any time
you wanted
so what be this some
kind of story to cover why you be
in the country illegally

no
no it be nothing like that

because i do not have time for

listen to i please
he said

what
what do he

he said that if i tried to leave
he would kill i

you do not understand you do not
know what he be like what he
what
we do
what he make i do

okay let we start at the begin
what do he make you do

he and i
i and gordon we
we killed some kid

i do not mean to i swear
he make
i help he said if i do not he would
kill i too
please you get to
help i

to go to hell for killing kid

what kid

i do not know
i never know they

about
twenty i guess

you be lying

no it be true i swear

twenty kid

yeah
thereabouts
i kinda stopped
counting after a while and gordon
said one or two might have get
away but

nobody can just up and kill twenty
kid

we do
yeah we do that

how

most time we would bring back just one
or two
sometimes as many as three



i always know when he be get
ready because he would go through the
car and clean it up make sure the
tire be good the engine
he
be always afraid something break
down and we would be catch

time to go



we would go a different direction every
time never hit the same part of
town twice
sometimes we would go for
hour just driving around until
we find somebody



he would use all kind of different
story
sometimes he would say he have
free ticket for the circus or he
be looking for a lose dog
that
one worked real good
other day

there you be we have be looking
for you like mad

you have

sure thing

i be sorry
i do not want you to
find out like this
i be sorry
i be
sorry

the chief will see you now

i do not know if you be aware of it
captain but i have an exceptionally
good vocabulary
i be a terror at
scrabble crossword puzzle but
even i be in awe of the vocabulary
that the press and the city council
have be exercise in reference
to this department courtesy of the
christine collins
incident
incompetent
cowardly
bully
reprehensible
mendacious and
invidious
those two courtesy of
that prick gustav Briegleb
bonus
word in scrabble both of they
especially invidious
hard to work
that one into a conversation
but
he manage it all right

sir i

the key of course be the context
in which word like this get used
you have to do that in scrabble
you know when somebody challenge
a word
show how it be used in a
sentence
so incompetent as in
department so incompetent that
they never realized that up to twenty
child be be kidnap and
murdered under they very nose

and here
so incompetent that they
insist they know good than a
mother the identity of she own child
forced he upon she and then
incarcerate she when she confront
they with evidence of they own
reprehensible behavior
that be
a twofer
incompetent and
reprehensible in the same sentence
guy must be a real terror at
crossword puzzle

captain you handle of the collins
case have exposed this department to
public ridicule
there be even the
potential for civil and criminal
liability

sir nobody could have known what
be going on up at that ranch
not
we not the sheriff department
the marshalls office
as for the
collins woman
i be still not convince that she
kid be among the victim up in
Wineville

no

no sir

there be four other photo of
miss boy that look a lot like
he
this clark kid could have
be mistaken

maybe he be
which raise the
obvious question
so what

sir

the mayor want this to go away
i
want this to go away
the way you
do that be to stop insist that
walter collins be not among those
kid killed up at that goddamned
ranch
because if the boy you
bring back be not walter collins
and he be not dead up at that ranch
then where the hell be he
people
will want to know why we have not
find he
why we be not we do
we job
but if on the other hand he be
or could be among those poor boy
killed up in Wineville
then the
inquiry stop
it be a momentary
embarrassment that you will have to
live with
but well a short
inconvenience than a lingering
problem would not you say captain

yes sir

the boyo be go for nearly a
year
if he be going to be find
it would have happen by now
whether
he be up at that ranch or not the
truth be he probably be dead
somewhere
well he mother accept
that now rather than later do not
you think

yes sir

good
Thatll be all captain

sir there be talk of an investigation
by the police commission

let i worry about the commission
but it would not hurt to find out
just who the fuck that kid be you
bring back from de kalb and why
he do this because the press buy
into he bullshit same as we do
that we be all taken in by the
scheme little bastard may help
take some of the sting off this

i boy be working on it now sir

i guess i still can not
accept it
it do not feel real to
i

i lost a daughter
to polio five year ago
there be
not a day go by i do not think i

the whole thing
they be going to
say that jones and the rest of the
do absolutely nothing wrong
that the real blame be with the
kid
and with you for be
difficult and forcing they to put
you away for you own safety

then we will just have to hire a
lawyer

to get the city council to call for
a hear by the welfare board


jut one problem


not one lawyer outside this room

i see

which be why i be do this pro
bono

so be this

subpoena request for deposition

you do not have to look they over
too closely chief you own copy
should be arriving any time now
the city council have also agreed to
look into this start immediately

Goddamnit

i think this be suppose to go
away
this be an election year i
can not afford this kind of press

it be going away sir
i instruct
captain jones

i be afraid falling on he sword and
saying he make a mistake be not going
to be good enough chief
if we
take he out of the picture for a
while it might help calm thing
down until the hear finished
there be several people on the
council who be planning to run
against i and they would love to accuse
i of allow a renegade police
force to operate with impunity

we friend in the press be have
a field day with this mess
i be
get five hundred phone call
letter and telegram a day demanding
to know what the hell be going on
at city hall that we allow we police
force to brutalize woman and misplace
child
christ all this picture
need now be for somebody to kick a
puppy for the camera
this be a train chief and we need
to either get in front of it or be
run over by it

mayor cryer
i stand by i man
you know that

i do
and you know where i stand
so the question be
be we going to
stand together
or hang together

gentleman
gentleman please
as
mayor of los angeles it be i duty
to preserve the peace in we city
which have be disrupted by recent
event in the case of christine
collins
as a result we have
decided that captain

jones of
the lincoln height division be to
be suspended from active duty
effective immediately

what be the charge chief

the charge be conduct unbecoming an
officer and use improper and
abusive language toward mrs
collins
it **further/far charge that he exceed
he authority as a police officer
by incarcerate mrs
collins on
the allege charge of insanity
without sufficient because

mayor cryer be you aware that the
city council have say it plan to
open it own investigation into the
collins case

i have hear this yes
but since
one of the main purpose of such a
hearing by the city council would
be to suspend captain jones and
since that action have now be taken
the question be moot

which make it look like the only
reason jones be be suspended be
to head off the city council

investigation
be you concern
that an outside investigation might
go uncomfortably high up the food
chain

i will not even dignify that question
with a response
good day

cheer up chief
that little show
should take the wind out of they
sail
by monday this issue will
be as cold as yesterday fish
never underestimate the public
lack of attention and potential for
apathy
old news be dead news
you will see


reverend what

sorry to barge in so late mrs
collins but it take i a while to
find the right people for the right
job
these three gentleman be

before coming to the lord have live
live of brutality vice and crime
now they be pledge to do god
work
and if this be not it i do not
know what be

people who bring charge against
the police have a habit of

disappearing right before the trial
i be a big believer in the power of
prayer mrs
collins

backup from time to time never hurt

there be nearly one thousand people
gathered in this chamber more than
have ever be in this room before

i therefore ask you to refrain from
demonstration of any kind
we be
all here because we want to find
out the real fact in this case
and everybody be going to be hear
if we have to sit here for a week

mr
thorpe i do not see any other
member of the police commission

that be odd
we specifically
stipulate that we would begin we
hearing with testimony from the
police department
be there any
representative of the police
commission in the room
be chief davis here
be captain jones here
be there
anyone here representing the police

mr
chairman
richard thomas the
evening herald
both the police
chief and captain jones be in san
pedro for a police inspection at a
station there

only reason i know be we have a
couple of we boy out covering the
thing

be you telling i they directly
violate the wish of the city
council
that they refused to attend
a vital hear so they could conduct
a routine inspection in san pedro
and what the hell be jones do at
an inspection after be suspended
i hate to call a recess before we have
even start but i think a few
phone call be in order
so we will
take a half hour break then continue
with the witness who have appear
here today
but let it be known
that captain jones and police chief
davis will be subpoena and required
to appear here tomorrow morning

mrs
collins could you come across
the street with i for just a moment

but
should not we

i think there be something you should
see

the police decided it be good
to keep this off the main docket in
order to avoid exactly the sort of
chaos we have across the street


mrs
collins
i be leanne clay
this be i husband john
i just
wanted to pass on i sympathy
what we go through waiting to
hear anything about we son david
be bad enough and now this
but there be no call for what the
police do to you
no call at all

all rise

hey
i see you in the paper
you
get a lot of moxie standing up to
the police like that

gordon stewart northcott you have
be charged with three count of
murder in the first degree with an
additional seventeen count under
review by the district attorney
office
how do you plea

not guilty you honor

in light of the defendant penchant
for international travel no bail
will be set
this court will receive
preliminary motion by tomorrow
morning with a trial date to be
set for the early open on the
court calendar
the defendant be remand into
custody
bailiff



the boy walter collins be report
as missing on march

we then institute a nationwide
search
on july we received a
cable indicate that a boy match
he description have be find in
de kalb illinois
upon questioning
he admit to be walter collins
and we make arrangement to transport
he back to california

where mrs
collins told you the boy
be not she son

yes
she deny he identity in
spite of all evidence pointing to
the contrary

but as subsequent event have
demonstrated she be correct
so
what prompt you to send she for
psychological evaluation

whether or not this be in fact the
correct boy be not relevant to i
decision
throughout this period
she act strangely
she be often
cool aloof and unemotional
especially when presented with the
boy we locate in de kalb and in
we subsequent conversation
it
be because of she disturb
behavior that i submitted she for
observation to the psychopathic
ward of los angeles county general
hospital

just like that
you snap you
finger and an innocent woman be
throw into the psycho ward

she be not

every home in this state be in grave
danger when a police captain can
take a woman into he office and
five minute later have she throw
into the psychopathic ward on his
own authority

she be not

what be that captain

she be not throw
she be
escort

escort throw the verb do not
matter captain
what do matter
be that she incarceration be ordered
without a warrant

i be holding a carbon copy of the
affidavit of insanity that be issued
in the case of the state of
california vs
christine collins
who signed the affidavit

i do

and what be the date on this
document

september th

but mrs
collins be incarcerate
on september th

the form be backdate

yes so it would appear
the bottom
of the page be reserved for recording
where and when the warrant be
serve
but it have not be filled
in
may i assume from this that
the warrant be never serve

that be correct
there be no need
to serve the warrant since she be
at that time already in custody

let i see if i have this straight
woman be throw into the
psychopathic ward without a warrant
because no warrant exist and
when it be finally written six
day later there be no need to
sign it or go to a judge because

she be already in the asylum
be
this correct captain

technically
yes

extraordinary step be necessary
because we be dealing with an
extraordinary situation
be it we
fault that we be be deceive
by the boy who claimed to be walter
collins
no
in light of he claim
and she behavior who would not begin
to wonder if there be something
wrong with she

because she question you

because she would not listen because
she insist on be obstinate and
taking matter into she own hand
best left to qualify officer
because

because she be fighting for the
life of she son
boy who may
have still be alive while you
be wasting valuable time deny
you have do anything wrong

and in the end that be what happen
be not it
at some point while all
this be going on walter collins
die along with as many as nineteen
other youth on the northcott ranch
in Wineville
be that correct
captain

yes
it be

no far question

so after much effort we be
able to identify this boy who be
have be responsible for so much
recent trouble as arthur hutchins
of cedar rapid iowa
between
this and the arrest of the man
suspect of murdering the real
walter collins we have clear up
two of the big mystery in the
history of los angeles
i hope that you gentleman of the
press will give as much space to
the good thing we do as the mistake
that be make on rare occasion

lady and gentleman let i
introduce you to the boyo real
mother mrs
janet hutchins

i hope he have not be too much
trouble for you

oh no not at all

mrs
hutchins
mrs
collins the
woman he be staying with wanted
he to have these
they be the
clothes she let he wear

well thank you
be not that nice
arthur
tell the nice officer thank
you

i do not want they
give they to
somebody else

precocious little fellow be not he

it be not i fault
it be the
police
they said i be walter
collins not i
it be not i idea

there
blame the police for you
own mistake
we have see a lot of
that lately have not we


i be up here reverend

when walter be
when he be here
i would walk past he bedroom when he
be asleep and even if i could not
see he or hear he i could
feel
he in here


mother and they child be
connected in amazing way
i uncle
joined the army during the big war
and the day he die before we ever
hear a word about it i grandmother
wake up in the middle of the night
and said Bobbys go
she
just
know

that be why i do not think walter be
dead
i can still feel he in
this room


mrs
collins

i know what the police said
but
the remain
what they find on
that ranch be so
most of it can not
even be properly identified
what
if that boy make a mistake when he
picked walters picture


i understand that you do not want to
accept this
what mother do
but you have to let go
and start
over
for yourself
he would want you
to move on

maybe
and maybe he would want i to
keep looking
maybe he be waiting
for i somewhere


he be christine


in that place where we will all be
reunited with we love one someday
and on that day he will know front
to back end to end heart and
soul
that you do everything you
could christine
everything


we should go



this meet will now come to order

this committee have now hear all of
the testimony and in light of the
fact present issue the follow
statement

mr
foreman have the jury reach a
verdict

we have you honor

while the city council have no power
to directly remove commissioner or

the employee who serve under they
it nevertheless can perform the
function of making recommendation
this committee therefore report
and recommend
first that the majority member of
the police commission deserve the
severe condemnation for they
decision to whitewash the collins
case

bailiff will you bring i the
verdict of the jury

second we recommend that the
suspension of captain jones be make
permanent

will the defendant please rise

third that step be taken to
investigate a change in the
prevailing law and procedure by

which a citizen of this city can be
subject to incarceration in the
county mental facility
finally restoration of public
confidence in the police department
can only be achieve by the removal
of it chief of police and this
committee so recommend
this hear be conclude

you may read the verdict

we the jury find the defendant
gordon stewart northcott
guilty
on all count of murder in the first
degree

do the defendant wish to make a
statement before judgment be passed

never once get a fair shake from
you you honor or this court

goddamn be she
because she be the only one never
badmouthed i to the press

of we but they be not scare
stupid
they keep checking around
until they find a part of the coop
where the chicken wire be all messed
up



they figure we might be able to
yank the chicken wire and bring
down the corner maybe make enough
room to get out of there and run
but it would make an awful lot of
noise and if it be not wide enough
we would be stick
it might even bring
the whole place down

we get to try it

i hide in the wood for two day
too scare to move because i be
sure they would find i
i finally
start walking but every time a
car come up i be afraid it be
they
so i keep off the main road
until i see a train stopped at a
cross and i jump in

why do not you tell anyone what have
happen

i be afraid
i think they would
come after i or i folk

own until i get a free meal from
this lady mrs
lansing
i told
she i be an orphan on i own
she said i could stay on and
i

then i hear the police talking on
the radio about what happen at
the ranch and i think for sure
i can not go back now

why not

since i do not tell anybody what
