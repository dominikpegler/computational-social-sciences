i conjure thou by Rosalines bright
eye
by she high forehead and she
scarlet lip
by she fine foot straight leg and
quiver thigh
and the demesne that there adjacent
lie
that in thou likeness thou appear to
we

he jest at scar that never feel a
wound

romeo that she be that she

an openarse and thou a poperin pear


come shall we go

but soft what light through yonder
window break

it be the east and juliet be the
sun
arise fair sun and kill the
envious moon
who be already sick and pale with

that thou she maid art far more
fair than she
be not she maid since she be
envious
she vestal livery be but sick and
green
and none but fool do wear it


cast it off


it be i lady
it be i love
that she know she be

ay i

she speak
speak again bright angel

romeo romeo
Whyfore art thou
romeo
deny thou father and refuse thou
name
or if thou wilt not be but sworn
i love
and i will no longer be a capulet

shall i hear more or shall i speak
at this

tis but thou name that be i enemy
thou be thyself though not a
montague
what be montague
it be not hand
nor foot
nor arm nor face nor any other part
belong to a man
be some
other name
what be in a name
that which we call a rose
by any other word would smell as
sweet
so romeo would be he not romeo
called
retain that dear perfection which
he owe
without that title
romeo doff
thou name
and for thou name which be no part
of thou
take all myself

i take thou at thou word
call i but love and i will be new
baptised
henceforth i never will be romeo

what man art thou that thus
bescreened in night
so stumblest on i counsel

by a name i know not how to tell
thou who i be
i name dear saint be hateful to

because it be an enemy to thou

art thou not romeo and a montague

neither fair maid if either thou
dislike

how cam thou hither tell i
and whyfore
the garden wall be high and hard
to climb
and the place death consider
who thou art

with love light wing do i over
perch these wall
for stony limit cannot hold love
out
and what love can do that dare
love attempt
therefore thou kinsman be no stop
to i

if they do see thou they will
murder thou

i have night cloak to hide i
from they eye
and but thou love i let they find
i here
i life be well end by they

than death prorogue wanting of
thou love

thou knowest the mask of night be
on i face
else would a maiden blush bepaint
i cheek
for that which thou hast hear i
speak tonight
fain would i dwell on form fain
fain deny
what i have spoke
but farewell
compliment
dost thou love i


i know thou wilt say ay and i
will take thou word
yet if thou
swearest
thou mayst prove false
gentle
romeo
if thou dost love pronounce it
faithfully
or if thou think i be too
quickly win
i will frown and be perverse and
say thou nay
so thou wilt woo
but else not
for the world
in truth fair montague i be too
fond
and therefore thou mayst think i
haviour light
but trust i gentleman i will prove
more true
than those that have more cunning
to be strange

lady by yonder bless moon i vow
that tip with silver all these
fruittree top

swear not by the moon the
inconstant moon
that monthly change in she circle
orb
lest that thou love prove likewise
variable

what shall i swear by

do not swear at all
or if thou wilt swear by thou
gracious self
which be the god of i idolatry
and i will believe thou

if i heart dear love

well do not swear
although i joy
in thou
i have no joy of this contract
tonight
it be too rash too unadvised too

too like the lightning which do
cease to be
ere one can say it lighten

sweet good night
this bud of love by summer
ripening breath
may prove a beauteous flower when
next we meet
good night good night
as sweet
repose and rest
come to thou heart as that within i
breast

wilt thou leave i so unsatisfied

what satisfaction canst thou have
tonight

the exchange of thou love faithful
vow for mine

i give thou mind before thou didst
request it


and yet i would it be to give
again

wouldst thou withdraw it
for what
purpose love

but to be frank and give it thou
again

juliet

three word dear romeo and good
night indeed
if that thou bent of love be
honourable
thou purpose marriage send i word
tomorrow
by one that i will procure to come to

for naught so vile on the earth

revolt from true birth stumble
on abuse
