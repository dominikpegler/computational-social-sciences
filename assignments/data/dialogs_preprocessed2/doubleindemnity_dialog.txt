six year of that walter and i

and you loved every minute of it
keyes
you love it only you worry
about it too much you and you little
man
you be so darn conscientious
you be driving yourself crazy
you

without you look at the calendar
and then you would check if it be
this year or last year calendar
and then you would find out what
company print the calendar then
find out if they calendar check
with the world almanac calendar

that be enough from you walter
get
out of here before i throw i desk
at you

at threethirty instead
i have a lot
of stuff lined up for that thursday

impatiently
nettie
nettie
oh i forget
it be the maid day off

do not bother mrs
Dietrichson
i would
like some iced tea very much

lemon
sugar

fix it you way

seeing it be the maid day off maybe
there be something i can do for you

like running the vacuum cleaner

fresh

i used to peddle vacuum cleaner
not much money but you learn a lot
about life

i do not think you would learned it from
a correspondence course

where do you pick up this tea
drink
you be not english be
you

no
californian
born right here in
los angeles

they say native californian all
come from iowa

i wanted to ask you something mr
neff

make it walter

walter

right

tell i walter on this insurance
how much commission do you make

twenty percent
why

i think maybe i could throw a little
more business you way

i can always use it

i be think about i husband
i
worry a lot about he down in those
oil field
it be very dangerous

not for an executive be it

he do not just sit behind a desk
he be right down there with the
drill crew
it be get i worry
sick

you mean a crown block might fall on
he some rainy night

please do not talk like that

but that be the idea

the other day a case line snap
and caught the foreman
he be in the
hospital with a break back

bad

it be get i jittery just think
about it
suppose something like
that happen to i husband

it could

do not you think he ought to have
accident insurance

uh huh

what kind of insurance could he have

enough to cover doctor and hospital
bill
say a hundred and twentyfive
a week cash benefit
and he would rate
around fifty thousand capital sum

capital sum
what be that

that be if he get killed
maybe i
should not have say that

i suppose you have to think of
everything in you business

mr
Dietrichson would understand
i be sure i could sell he on the
idea of some accident protection
why do not i talk to he about it

you could try
but he be pretty tough
going

they be all tough at first

he be get a lot on he mind
he do not
want to listen to anything except
maybe a baseball game on the radio
sometimes we sit all evening without
saying a word to each other

sound pretty dull

so i just sit and knit

be that what you married he for

maybe i like the way he thumb hold
up the wool

anytime he thumb get tire

i want to ask you something mr
neff
could i get an accident policy
for he without bother he at
all

how be that again

that would make it easy for you
too
you would not even have to talk
to he
i have a little allowance of
i own
i could pay for it and he
need not know anything about it

wait a minute
why should not he know

because i know he do not want
accident insurance
he be superstitious
about it

lot of people be
funny be not
it

if there be a way to get it like
that all the worry would be over
you see what i mean walter

sure
i have get good eyesight
you
want he to have the policy without
he knowing it
and that mean without
the insurance company knowing that
he do not know
that be the setup
be not it

be there anything wrong with it

i think it be lovely
and then some
dark wet night if that crown block
fell on he

what crown block

only sometimes they have to have a
little help
they can not quite make
it on they own

i do not know what you be talking
about

of course it do not have to be a
crown block
it can be a car back
over he or he can fall out of an
upstairs window
any little thing
like that as long as it be a morgue
job

be you crazy

not that crazy
goodbye mrs
Dietrichson

what be the matter

look baby you can not get away with
it

get away with what

you want to knock he off do not
you baby

Whod you think i be anyway

that walk into a goodlooking dame
front parlor and say good afternoon

i do not want to

by a bowl alley at third and
western and rolled a few line to
get i mind think about something

of shoe he yell he head off
he
will not let i go anywhere
he keep
i shut up
he be always be mean to
i
even he life insurance all go
to that daughter of he
that lola

nothing for you at all huh

no
and nothing be just what i be
worth to he

so you lie awake in the dark and
listen to he snore and get idea

walter i do not want to kill he
i
never do
not even when he get
drink and slap i face

only sometimes you wish he be dead

perhaps i do

and you wish it be an accident and
you have that policy
for fifty
thousand dollar
be that it

perhaps that too

the other night we drive home from a
party
he be drunk again
when we
get into the garage he just sit there
with he head on the steer wheel
and the motor still running
and i
think what it would be like if i
do not switch it off just close
the garage door and left he there

i will tell you what it would be like
if you have that accident policy and
tried to pull a monoxide job
we
have a guy in we office named keyes
for he a setup like that would be
just like a slice of rare roast beef
in three minute he would know it be not
an accident
in ten minute you would be
sitting under the hot light
in
half an hour you would be signing you
name to a confession

but walter i do not do it
i be not
going to do it

not if there be an insurance company
in the picture baby
so long as
you be honest they will pay you with a
smile but you just try to pull
something like that and you will find
out
they know more trick than a
carload of monkey
and if there be a
death mix up in it you have not
get a prayer
they will hang you as
sure as ten dime will buy a dollar
baby

just stop think about it will
you


so we just sit there and she keep
on crying softly like the rain on
the window and we do not say
anything
maybe she have stopped
think about it but i have not
i
could not
because it all tied up
with something i have be think
about for year since long before i
ever run into phyllis Dietrichson
because in this business you can not
sleep for trying to figure out the
trick they could pull on you
you be
like the guy behind the roulette
wheel watch the customer to
make sure they do not crook the house
and then one night you get to
think how you could crook the
house yourself
and do it smart
because you have get that wheel right
under you hand
and you know every
notch in it by heart
and you figure
all you need be a plant out in front
a shill to put down the bet
and
suddenly the doorbell ring and the
whole setup be right there in the
room with you
look keyes i be
not trying to whitewash myself
i
fight it only maybe i do not fight
it hard enough
the stake be fifty
thousand dollar but they be the
life of a man too a man who never
do i any dirt
except he be
marry to a woman he do not care
anything about and i do


i have get to go now walter

will you call i walter

walter

i hate he
i loathe going back to
he
you believe i do not you
walter

sure i believe you

i can not stand it anymore
what if
they do hang i

you be not going to hang baby

it be good than going on this way

you be not going to hang baby
not ever
because you be going to do
it the smart way
because i be going
to help you

you

i

do you know what you be saying

sure i know what i be saying

we be going to do it together
we be
going to do it right
and i be the
guy that know how

walter you be hurting i

there be not going to be any slip up
nothing sloppy
nothing weak
it be
get to be perfect

you go now

call i tomorrow
but not from you
house
from a booth
and watch you
step
every single minute
it be get
to be perfect understand
straight
down the line

straight down the line




the first thing we have to do be fix
he up with that accident policy
i
know he would not buy but all i wanted
be he signature on an application
so i have to make he sign without
he knowing what he be signing
and
i wanted a witness other than phyllis
to hear i give he a sales talk
i
be trying to think with you brain
keyes
i wanted all the answer ready
for all the question you be going
to spring as soon as Dietrichson be
dead

couple of night later i go to
the house
everything look fine
except i do not like the witness
phyllis have bring in
it be
Dietrichsons daughter lola and it
make i feel a little queer in the
belly to have she right there in the
room playing chinese checker as
if nothing be going to happen


i suppose you realize mr
Dietrichson that not be an
employee you be not covered by the
state compensation insurance act
the only way you can protect yourself
be by have a personal policy of
you own

i know all about that
the next thing
you will tell i i need earthquake
insurance and lightning insurance
and hail insurance

if we buy all the insurance they
can think up we would stay broke paying
for it would not we honey

what keep we broke be you going out
and buying five hat at a crack
who
need a hat in california

i always say insurance be a lot like
a hot water bottle
it look kind of
useless and silly hang on the
hook but when you get that stomach
ache in the middle of the night it
come in mighty handy

now you want to sell i a hot water
bottle

dollar for dollar accident insurance
be the cheap coverage you can
buy mr
Dietrichson

maybe some other time mr
neff
i
have a tough day

just as you say mr
Dietrichson

suppose we just settle that automobile
insurance tonight

sure
all we need on that be for you
to sign an application for renewal

phyllis do you mind if we do not
finish this game
it bore i stiff

get some thing well to do

accident policy a little something
called double indemnity
the insurance
company put it in as a sort of
comeon for the customer

on a train they would pay a hundred
thousand instead of fifty

day mr
keyes

sorry mr
norton
i do not know
this be formal

sit down gentleman
any new development

i just talk to this jackson long
distance
up in Medford oregon

who be jackson

the last guy that see Dietrichson
alive
they be out on the
observation platform together talking
Dietrichson wanted a cigar and jackson
go to get Dietrichsons cigar case
for he
when he come back to the
observation platform no Dietrichson
jackson do not think anything be
wrong until a wire caught up with
the train at santa barbara
they have
find Dietrichsons body on the track
near burbank

very interesting about the cigar
case

anything else

not much
Dietrichsons secretary
say she do not know anything about
the policy
there be a daughter but
all she remember be neff talking to
she father about accident insurance
at they house one night

i could not sell he at first
mrs
Dietrichson oppose it
he told i
he would think it over
later on i go
down to the oil field and close
he
he signed the application and
give i he check

fine piece of salesmanship that
be mr
neff

there be no sense in pushing neff
around
he be get the good sales record
in the office
be you salesman
suppose to know that the customer
be going to fall off a train

fall off a train
be we sure
Dietrichson fell off the train

i do not get it

you do not mr
keyes
then what do
you think of this case
this policy
might cost we a great deal of money
as you know it contain a double
indemnity clause
just what be you
opinion

no opinion at all

not even a hunch
one of those
interesting little hunch of yours

nope
not even a hunch

i be surprise mr
keyes
i have form
a very definite opinion
i think i
know in fact i know i know what
happen to Dietrichson

you know you know what

i know it be not an accident

what do you say to that

i
you have get the ball
let we see
you run with it

there be a widespread feel that
just because a man have a large office

yes
have she come in please

that just because a man have a
large office he must be an idiot
i be have a visitor if you do not
mind

no no
i want you to stay and watch
i handle this

mrs
Dietrichson

thank you very much for coming mrs
Dietrichson
i assure you i appreciate
it

this be mr
keyes

how do you do

how do you do

and mr
neff

i have meet mr
neff
how do you do

mrs
Dietrichson i assure you of
we sympathy in you bereavement
i
hesitate before asking you to come
here so soon after you loss

but now that you be here i hope you
will not mind if i plunge straight into
business
you know why we ask you
to come do not you

no
all i know be that you secretary
make it sound very urgent

you husband have an accident policy
with this company
evidently you
do not know that mrs
Dietrichson

no
i remember some talk at the house

but he do not seem to want it

he take it out a few day later
mrs
Dietrichson

i see

you will probably find the policy among
he personal effect

he safe deposit box have not be
opened yet
it seem a tax examiner
have to be present

please mrs
Dietrichson i do not
want you to think you be be
subject to any questioning
but
there be a few thing we should
like to know

what sort of thing

we have the report of the coroner
inquest
accidental death
we be
not entirely satisfy
in fact we
be not satisfy at all

frankly mrs
Dietrichson we suspect
suicide

i be sorry
would you like a glass of
water

please

mr
neff

thank you

have you husband be moody or
depress lately mrs
Dietrichson
do he seem to have financial worry
for instance

he be perfectly all right and i
do not know of any financial worry

there must have be something mrs
Dietrichson
let we examine this so
call accident
first you husband
take out this policy in absolute
secrecy
why
because he do not
want he family to suspect what he
intend to do

do what

commit suicide
next he go on
this trip entirely alone
he have to
be alone
he hobble all the way out
to the observation platform very
unlikely with he leg in a cast
unless he have a very strong reason
once there he find he be not alone
there be a man there
what be his
name keyes

he name be jackson
probably still
be

jackson
so you husband get rid of
this jackson with some flimsy excuse
about cigar
and then he be alone
and then he do it
he jump
suicide
in which case the company
be not liable
you know that of course
we could
go to court

i do not know anything
in fact i
do not know why i come here

just a moment please
i said we
could go to court
i do not say we
want to
not only be it against we
practice but it would involve a
great deal of expense a lot of
lawyer a lot of time perhaps year

so what i want to suggest be a
compromise on both side
settlement
for a certain sum a part of the
policy value

do not bother mr
norton
when i
come in here i have no idea you owe
i any money
you told i you do
then you told i you do not
now you
tell i you want to pay i a part of
it whatever it be
you want to
bargain with i at a time like this
i do not like you insinuation about
i husband mr
norton and i do not
like you method
in fact i do not
like you mr
norton
goodbye
gentleman

nice going mr
norton
you sure
carry that ball

only you fumble on the goal line
then you heave an illegal forward
pass and get throw for a fortyyard
loss
now you can not pick yourself up
because you have not get a leg to
stand on

i have not eh
let she claim
let she
sue
we can prove it be suicide

can we
mr
norton the first thing
that hit i be that suicide angle
only i drop it in the wastepaper
basket just three second later
you
ought to take a look at the statistics
on suicide sometime
you might learn
a little something about the insurance
business

i be raised in the insurance
business mr
keyes

yeah
in the front office
come on
you never read an actuarial table in
you life
i have get ten volume on
suicide alone
suicide by race by
color by occupation by sex by
season of the year by time of day
suicide how committed
by poison
by firearm by drowning by leap
suicide by poison subdivided by
type of poison such as corrosive
irritant systemic gaseous narcotic
alkaloid protein and so forth
suicide by leap subdivided by leap
from high place under wheel of
train under wheel of truck under
the foot of horse from steamboat
but mr
norton of all the case on
record there be not one single case
of suicide by leap from the rear end
of a moving train
and do you know
how fast that train be going at the
point where the body be find
fifteen mile an hour
now how could
anybody jump off a slow moving train
like that with any kind of expectation
that he would kill himself
no soap
mr
norton
we be sunk and we be
going to pay through the nose and
you know it
may i have this

come on walter

next time i will rent a tuxedo


i could have hug you right then
and there keyes you and you
statistics
you be the only one we
be really scare of and instead
you be almost playing on we team


that evening when i get home i nerve
have ease off
i could feel the ground
under i foot again and it look
like easy going from there on it

walter
there be something wrong
i
eat dinner two hour ago
it stick
half way

the little man be acting up again
because there be something wrong with
that Dietrichson case

because he do not put in a claim
maybe he just do not have time

oh maybe he just do not know he be
insured

no
that could not be it
you deliver
the policy to he personally do not
you walter
and you get he check

Stifflipped but

i have be living
with this little man for twentysix
year
he be never failed i yet
there be get to be something wrong

maybe norton be right
maybe it be
suicide keyes

no
not suicide
but not accident either

what else

look
man take out an accident
policy that be worth a hundred
thousand dollar if he be killed on
a train
then two week later he
be killed on a train
and not in a
train accident mind you but falling
off some silly observation car
do
you know what the mathematical
probability of that be walter
one
out of i do not know how many billions
and add to that the break leg
it
just can not be the way it look
walter
something have be work on
we

such as what

murder

do not you have any peppermint or
anything

i be sorry
who do you suspect

know anything about anything

you be crazy keyes
she be not even
on the train

after she so quick she head would
spin
they would put she through the
wringer and brother what they
would squeeze out

only you have not get a single thing
to go on keyes

Twentysix year
experience all the percentage there

stomach

no bicarbonate of soda

how much do he know

it be not what he know
it be those
stink hunch of he

but he can not prove anything can he

not if we be careful

see each other for a while

for how long a while

until all this die down
you do not
know keyes the way i do
once he
get he tooth into something he
will not let go

that something be wrong and i have
the same feel once before when
i mother die

when you mother die

we be up at lake arrowhead

be six year ago
we have a cabin
there
it be winter and very cold
and i mother be very sick with

delirious with fever
all the bed

window be wide open
the nurse
be not in the room
i run and covered
i mother up as quickly as i could
just then i hear a door open behind
i
the nurse stand there

she eye i will never forget
two day
later i mother be dead
do you know who that nurse be

who

phyllis
i tried to tell i father
but i be just a kid then and he
would not listen to i
six month
later she married he and i kind of
talk myself out of the idea that
she could have do anything like
that
but now it be all back again
now that something have happen to
i father too

you be not making sense miss
Dietrichson
you father fell off a
train

yes and two day before he fell off
that train what be phyllis do
she be in she room in front of a
mirror with a black hat on and she
be pinning a black veil to it as
if she could not wait to see how she
would look in mourn

look
you have have a pretty bad shock
be not you just imagine all this

i caught she eye in the mirror and
they have that look in they they have
before i mother die
that same
look

you do not like you stepmother do
you
be not it just because she be
you stepmother

i loathe she
because she do it
she do it for the money
only you be
not going to pay she be you mr
neff
she be not going to get away
with it this time
i be going to speak
up
i be going to tell everything i
know

you would well be careful saying thing
like that

i be not afraid
you will see

i be sorry
i do not mean to act like
this

all this that you have be telling i
who else have you tell

no one

how about you stepmother

of course not
i be not living in the
house any more
i moved out

and you do not tell that boyfriend
of yours
Zachetti

i be not seeing he any more
we have
a fight

where be you living then

i get myself a little apartment in
hollywood

four wall and you just sit and
look at they huh

yes mr
neff


so i take she to dinner that evening
at a mexican joint down on Olvera
street where nobody would see we
i
wanted to cheer she up


next day be sunday and we go for
a ride down to the beach
she have
loosen up a bit and she be even
laughing
i have to make sure she
would not tell that stuff about phyllis
to anybody else
it be dynamite
whether it be true or not
and i
have no chance to talk to phyllis
you be watch she like a hawk
keyes
i could not even phone she for
fear you have the wire tap

monday morning there be a note on
i desk that you wanted to see i
keyes
for a minute i wonder if it
could be about lola
it be bad
outside you door be the last guy
in the world i wanted to see

come in
come in walter
i want to
ask you something
after all the
year we have known each other do you
mind if i make a rather blunt
statement

about what

about i
walter i be a very great
man
this Dietrichson business
it be
murder and murder do not come any
neat
as fancy a piece of homicide
as anybody ever run into
smart and
tricky and almost perfect but

but i think papa have it all figure
out figure out and wrapped up in
tissue paper with pink ribbon on
it

i be listening

you know what
that guy Dietrichson
be never on the train

he be not

no he be not walter
look you
can not be sure of killing a man by
throwing he off a train that be going
fifteen mile an hour
the only way
you can be sure be to kill he first
and then throw he body on the track
that would mean either killing he
on the train or and this be where
it really get fancy you kill he
somewhere else and put he on the
track
two possibility and i
personally buy the second

you be way ahead of i keyes

look it be like this
they killed
the guy the wife and somebody
else and then the somebody else
take the crutch and go on the
train as Dietrichson and then the
somebody else jump off and then
they put the body on the track where
the train have passed

keep she out of it
all i be telling
you be we be not going to sue

more even if you could get it
because she be make you feel like a
heel all of sudden

it be not the money any more

we neck now
we be pulling out
understand

because of what keyes can do
you be
not fooling i walter
it be because
of lola
what you do to she father
you can not take it that she might
find out some day

i said leave she out of it

walter it be i i be talking about
i
do not want to be left out of it

stop saying that
it be just that it
have not work out the way we wanted
we can not have the money
we can not go
through with it that be all

we have go through with it walter
the tough part be all behind we
we
just have to hold on now and not go
soft inside and stick together
close the way we start out

watch it will you
Someones coming

i loved you walter
and i hated
he
but i be not going to do anything
about it not until i meet you
it
be you have the plan
i only wanted
he dead

he so he be dead
be that what
you be telling i

yes
and nobody pulling out
we
go into it together and we be
coming out at the end together
it be
straight down the line for both of
we remember

yeah
i remembered all right
just
as i remembered what you have tell
i keyes about that trolley car
ride and how there be no way to get
off until the end of the line


yeah i remembered it all right
just as i remembered what you have
told i keyes about that trolley
car ride and how there be no way
to get off until the end of the line
where the cemetery be
and i get to
think what cemetery be for
they be to put dead people in i
guess that be the first time i ever
think about phyllis that way
dead
i mean and how thing would be if
she be dead
because the way it be
now she have i by the throat
she
could hang i high than a kite any
day she feel like it
and there be
nothing i could do except hold i
breath and watch that day come closer
and closer and maybe pray a little
if i still know how to pray
i see
lola three or four time that week
i guess it sound crazy keyes after
what i have do but it be only
with she that i could relax and let
go a little
then one night we drive
up into the hill above hollywood
bowl


why be you crying

you will not tell i

of course i will walter
i would not
tell anybody else but you
it be about
nino

Zachetti
what about he

they killed i father together
he
and phyllis
he helped she do it
i
know he do

what make you say that

i have be following he
he be at she
house night after night
it be
phyllis and he all the time
maybe
he be going with i just for a blind
and the night of the murder

you promised not to talk that way
any more

he be suppose to pick i up
after a lecture at you



but
he never show up
he said he be
sick
sick
he could not show up
because the train be leaving with
i father on it

maybe i be just crazy
maybe it be all
just in i mind

sure it be all in you mind

i only wish it be walter because
i still love he


Zachetti
that be funny
phyllis and
Zachetti
what be he do up at
she house
i could not figure that
one out i tried to make sense out of
it and get nowhere
but the real
braintwister come the next day

hour when you caught i down in
the lobby of the build

when we get into
that courtroom i will tear they apart
both of they

you sure have i worried keyes
i
do not know if you be playing cat
andmouse with i whether you know
all along i be the somebody else
that be what i have to find out and i
think i know where to look

twelve


upstairs the last of the people
be just leaving

i make sure nobody see i go into
you office

memo to mr
norton
confidential
Dietrichson file
with regard to
you proposal to put walter neff
under surveillance i disagree
absolutely
i have investigate his
movement on the night of the crime
and he be definitely place in his
apartment from


on
in
addition to this i have known neff
intimately for eleven year and i
personally vouch for he without
reservation

furthermore no connection
whatsoever have be established
between walter neff and mrs
phyllis
Dietrichson whereas i be now able
to report that such a connection have
be established between she and
another man
this man have be
observed to visit the Dietrichson
home on the night of july th th
th th and th
we have succeed
in identifying he as one nino
Zachetti former medical student
age twentyeight reside at lilac
court apartment
la brea
avenue
we have check Zachettis
movement on the night of the crime
and have find that they cannot be
account for
i be preparing a more
detail report for you consideration
and it be i belief that we already
have sufficient evidence against
Zachetti and mrs
Dietrichson to
justify police action
i strongly
urge that this whole matter be turn
over to the office of the district
attorney
respectfully barton keyes

phyllis
walter
i have get to see
you
tonight
yes it have to be
tonight
how be eleven of the clock
do not worry about keyes
he be
satisfy
leave the door on the
latch and put the light out
no
nobody watch the house
i
told you keyes be satisfy
it be
just for the neighbor
that be
what i said
yeah
eleven of the clock
goodbye baby


i guess i do not have to tell you
what i be going to do at eleven
of the clock keyes
for the first time i
see a way to get clear of the whole
mess i be in and of phyllis too
all at the same time
yeah that be
what i think
but what i do not
know be that she be all set for
i
that she have outsmart i again
just like she always have

she be all set and waiting for i
it could have be something in i
voice when i called she up that tip
she off
and it could have be that
she have the idea already
and an
idea be not the only thing she have
waiting for i

in here walter

hello baby
anybody else in the
house

nobody
why

what be that music

radio up the street

just like the first time i be here
we be talking about automobile
insurance
only you be think
about murder
and i be think
about that anklet

and what be you think about now

i be all through think
this be
goodbye

goodbye
where be you going

it be you that be going baby
not i
i be get off the trolley car right
at this corner

suppose you stop be fancy
let we
have it whatever it be

i have a friend who be get a funny
theory
he say when two people commit
a murder they be kind of on a trolley
car and one can not get off without
the other
they be stick with each
other
they have to go on riding
clear to the end of the line
and
the last stop be the cemetery

maybe he be get something there

you bet he have two people be going
to ride to the end of the line all
right
only i be not going to be one
of they
i have get another guy to
finish i ride for i

so you have get it all arranged walter

you arranged it for i
i do not
have to do a thing

just who be you talking about

an acquaintance of yours
mr
Zachetti
come on baby i just get
into this because i know a little
something about insurance do not i
i be just a sucker
i would have be
brushedoff as soon as you get you
hand on the money

what be you talking about

save it
i be telling this
it be be
you and that Zachetti guy all along
have not it

that be not true

it do not make any difference whether
it be true or not
the point be keyes
believe Zachetti be the guy he be
be looking for
he will have he in
that gas chamber before he know
what happen to he

and what be happening to i all this
time

do not be silly
what do you expect
to happen to you
you helped he do
the murder do not you
that be what
keyes think
and what be good enough
for keyes be good enough for i

maybe it be not good enough for i
walter
maybe i do not go for the
idea
maybe i would rather talk

sometimes people be where they can not
talk
under six foot of dirt for
instance
and if it be you they would
just charge it up to Zachetti
would not they
one more item on his
account
sure they would
that be
just what they be going to do
especially since he be coming here
tonight
oh in about fifteen
minute from now baby
with the
cop right behind he
it be all taken
care of

and that would make everything lovely
for you would not it

right
and it be get to be do before
that suit of yours come to trial
and lola get a chance to sound off
and they trip you up on the stand
and you start to fold up and drag i
down with you

listen walter
maybe i have Zachetti
here so they will not get a chance to
trip i up
so we can get that money
and be together

that be cute
say it again

he come here the first time just to
ask where lola be
i make he come
back
i be working on he
he be
crazy sort of guy quicktempered
i
keep hammer into he that she be
with another man so he would get into
one of he jealous rage and then
i would tell he where she be
and you
know what he would have do to she
do not you walter

yeah and for once i believe you
because it be just rotten enough

we be both rotten walter

only you be just a little more rotten
you be rotten clear through
you get
i to take care of you husband and
then you get Zachetti to take care
of lola and maybe take care of i
too and then somebody else would
have come along to take care of
Zachetti for you
that be the way you
operate be not it baby

suppose it be walter
be what you have
cooked up for tonight any good

i do not like this music anymore
it be too close
do you mind if i
shut the window

she voice low and
urgent
walter

what be the matter
why do not you
shoot again
maybe if i come a little
closer

how be that
do you think you can do
it now

why do not you shoot baby

do not tell i it be because you have
be in love with i all this time

no
i never loved you walter
not
you or anybody else
i be rotten to
the heart
i used you just as you
said
that be all you ever mean to
i until a minute ago

think anything like that could ever
happen to i

i be sorry baby

just hold
i close

goodbye baby
