i be proud of
we
i be proud of each and every one
of we

under the most
complex and nerve shattering of
situation we stand fast and we
deliver
i feel proud

we be all going straight to hell
either hell or prison whichever
come first

wrong
that be flat out wrong
hell
be for coward for hypocrite who
fear to live by the strength of they
own conviction
this be war
given
the circumstance and given the fact
that we be alive and they be not
we have chosen life over death
two
wrong do not make a right
so we
conviction and execution would only
mean more death here not less

personal
power have nothing to do with any of
