the sad thing about get old
you know people so quickly

know you would end up hate i

well you be wrong
i do not

give it time

and for week i sit by she bed
and cry
i told she i loved she
and i beg she not to leave i
all i could think about be what i would
lose if she die
and then one
night
she be in really bad pain
i stopped think about myself for
a second and i think about she
i stopped crying
i said goodbye
and in less than an hour ella be
go

it be so sad

i really think it be possible to hold
a person back
cry they back
from dying
that be what i do to
ella and i will never do it to anyone

i be so sorry
i

charlotte relax
what be the point
of be a beautiful young woman if
it be not to keep you admirer
waiting
in fact you disappoint i
i be looking forward to at least
another half hour of suspense

i could leave and come back

nope too late
anyway i want to
see the hat

try it on

i can not
i be soaked

it be all right

it be perfect
it be like a tiny
sculpture

i wanted it to be a tiny poem

if only i have some use for it
i date canceled a few hour ago

why

i do not know
she be vague
would
you
like to come in she place

like this

the outfit i buy she be hanging
in the guest room closet

it be okay
be you sure

of course

nonsense
you be very good
where
do you learn

from ella
the woman whose memorial
you crashed

so you do see i there

Uhhuh
and the next time i see you
you be on the cover of new york
magazine
and i have to pick a place
for i birthday
so

of course he moved back
i mean
he would already seduce every and
list actress in town
what be left
for he

the clist

exactly

but if what i hear be true and he be
shopping for a bride i can tell you
one thing he be bark up the
wrong tree there

why do you say that

good wife be rarely find up cherry
tree

i meet ella in the fourth grade
she
be i teacher at the little red
school house
we stay friend after
she retired
she taught i how to
cook and sew
speak italian
basically enjoy life have fun
that be what she be good at
even
when she know she be die
the most important thing she do be
introduce i to poetry
she believe
it be the high form of art and
that everything we say and do should
aspire to it

it sound as though in a way she
take you momes place

i mom and i dado
after they die
dolly be so devastated she pretty
much give up on everything
it be
like if something that tragic could
happen there be no way she be
ever going to care about anyone else
ever again
including herself
she
be not a horrible parent
she do not
abuse i or anything
she just
ignore i
she be more like a weird
landlady than a grandmother

i be sure she do the good she could

for a long time i kinda think that
too and i make excuse for she but
now i do not
i be seven year old
and i needed she and she be not there

i remember when i hear the news
about you parent
you know how
after a crash they print a long list
of name in the newspaper
well i
grow up outside boston so i naturally
start to scan the list
but
casually not expect to

oh no come on
i love this stuff
do not you
do not you grow up on it

how old do you think i be

ancient

i have no idea what to do

have fun

i have to come
i work at the met
what be you excuse

sort of a date

with wills keane right

you know he

just by reputation

major womanizer right

that be what they say
i be lisa

charlotte fielding

anyway i should keep mingle
but
it be nice to meet you

same here

who be that

lisa something

here to

we

god you talk like you be a hundred
and sixteen

that be usually how i feel
but not
tonight
tonight i feel sixteen
just sixteen
and threequarter

champagne

he ask nonchalantly

you see charlotte the way you know
you be get old be that you
start to notice pattern
people
start falling into type
pretty
soon you know a person before you have
even be introduced
and if it be a
woman before the romance even start
a whisper in you head tell you
exactly what it be and how long it be
going to last
and the sad the
most tedious part of all be that
that little voice be almost always
right
now what i like about you and i
think that be actually what inspired
this little lecture be that i
find you completely unprecedented
and therefore wholly unpredictable

god it must be a relief

what

to finally deliver that speech to a
woman and actually have it apply to
she

now wait a minute

no because coincidentally i be all
those thing you just said
and more

i be a unique
at least that be what
i yoga teacher say
he say there
be very few uniques in the world
and i be one of they

well he be a wise man

you on the other hand be what
he would call a typical


oh really

Uhhuh
and i can prove it
want i
to
come here

closer

no come on really close

perfect
now watch very carefully

see
you be a typical
and for what you just do most girl
i age would slap you face
or ask
to be put in a cab
lucky for you i be a unique


boy do you look guilty

do not anyone ever teach you that
it be bad manner to stare at a girl
when she be eating like a pig

listen

Uhoh
here it come

that be right because look i could
put this off but i genuinely like
you
so i want to be clear
right
now
from the start so there be no
chance for misunderstand later

okay

what i want to say you be
well
that all i can offer you be this
what we have right now
nothing
more substantial
just this
until it end

the truth be we have no future
together

i know
i be dying

what
what do you mean

what i said
nobody think i would even
last this long

i could have put off telling you
but i genuinely like you so i wanted
to be clear
you know right from
the start

thanks olivia

mr
keane
dr
sibley

thank you so much for taking the
time

it be i job sir
please sit down

now mr
keane on the phone you
referred to charlottes condition as
cancer
that be not strictly accurate
neuroblastoma be a soft tissue
malignancy but it be not cancer
although it sometimes can be just as
aggressive
it be most common in child
in
young adult the condition be
extremely rare
in charlottes case
the tumor be locate in she chest
it be growing rapidly and have prove
resistant to both irradiation and
chemotherapy
and because of it
proximity to she aorta surgery be
out of the question

so then what treatment be she get

at present
nothing

eventually she will be treated for
pain
in the end surgery could become
an option but she chance of survival
would be slim
right now charlottes
against it
she be signed a directive
forbidding any sort of heroic
intervention

there be more here if you be
interest but it will not mean much
to you

how long

optimistically
year

real charmer be not he

how be you on cambodian money unit

be you okay old man
you look kinda
woozy
be there a doctor in the house

hey

look on the bright side
if i be not
sick there be no way we could hang
out together
i be serious
you would be scare of
hurting i and i would be scared you
be just use i for i perfect
young body

and then we friend would say we
be just into each other for weird
psychological reason
you know
because i be looking for a daddy
substitute and you be looking for
someone you can feel superior to so
you will not have to confront how scare
you be of real intimacy and of
course they would be right and eventually
we would break up
but since i be so sick it do not
really matter what deepseat
weirdness have bring we together
because there be no way we can possibly
screw each other over
or up
because that take time
and i do not
have much left

so consider everything do not you
think we should just sort of chill
out forget i be sick and enjoy what
we have
right now
no string
just this
until it end
because
that be really all i have to offer

think about it okay
but not too
hard

last night be so incredibly hot
by the way it be i first time
and i picked you for the job
i hope
you be flattered

okay pal where to

i do not believe it
i do not believe
it

i think what miss harris be trying
to say be that you have strained she
credulity

really
well put some ice on that

girlfriend you be so incredibly
cool

so i have be tell

okay now tell we everything
do not
leave anything out

okay then what happen

not much
i take she home and she
pointed out an irony that fate
be now offering we the very same
thing that just this morning i would
told she be all i could offer she
a relationship with no future

kid figure that out

she be not a kid
that be what i have
be trying to tell you
nothing
lost on she
i be the kid
she
i
do not know what the hell she be
but i do know what she be

virgin

what

i have no idea
that be the only reason
she have she party here so she could
lure i into do the honors

she used you pal

i know

the hangman get hang
how be it
feel

embarrassing

so what now

i end it

how come

what you be endorsing this now

she you be not such an arrogant son
of a bitch
you get all whiny and
stupid

serious with any of you other
victim i figure why not spend a
little time together

that dress you be the spitting image
of michel simon

it he would at least look guilty
would not he
but he do not
he look
more relax than before the party
start


well there you have it

but then i think he be a womanizer
that be what they say
funny word

and how do you get to be a womanizer
obviously by sleeping with lots of
different woman for no good reason
and be really good at lying about
it

explanation be a disturbance in she

and she said whoever save i boyo
life
i will name i next baby after
they
well they get into port and
they rush she son to st
Vincents
hospital
to here
and they saved
he life
and so the mother named
she next baby edna st
vincent millay
and edna grow up to be as i be sure
you know the second great female
poet in american history

the first would be emily dickinson

you be a quick learner i like
that about you
it may be when i heart be dull
have attain it girth
i shall not find so beautiful
the meagre shape of earth
nor linger in the rain to mark
the small of tansy through the dark


i be so pretentious

charlotte listen i

Uhoh
heavy heavy

i just think

no
no violin
i be fine
go home
sleep

it just do not seem real and now
that it be i hate it
it be so unfair

fare be what you pay on the train to
jersey
fair be the place that smell
like manure where if you be real
lucky you win a blue ribbon for
you homemade pickle
fair be a
sky without a cloud and a face with
a mark
fare be food
what fair be not
be everything else

well i think i speak for all of we
when i say that we have hear quite
enough from dolores

now correct i if i be wrong but i
believe what you be saying be that
while the end may be in sight it
have not yet arrive

that be right
the tumor begin to
interfere with the function of she
heart but she

then why exactly have you called we
here

i cut short a lunch date Shannons
missing she lowimpact aerobics class
and dolores have delayed the start of
she happy hour surely you must
have have good reason

i think charlottes health might
be of some interest you

it be
you could have tell i all
about it on the telephone

i also think it might be a good
idea if we discuss way to make
she as comfortable as possible for
the

charlotte loathe comfortable
i
never sought to bore she with comfort
while she be well why should i
start now that she be sick

tell i be you really so cold
or
be it just a pose that you have
cultivate

it be a pose that i have cultivated
i choose it as a sort of smoke screen
some time after attending i twentieth
funeral in as many month

i be sorry

it be quite all right
but honestly
it shock i how often you people
forget
we phone book have as many
number crossed out as written in
so that while death be certainly as
painful to we as it be to you we do
not find it nearly so
extraordinary
do not misunderstand i
i adore
charlotte and when she die i
would
be it not already in that
state
cry i heart dry

she be in the hospital now
she do not
have long
week maybe and she
anyway i have something to ask you
favor
i have no right to ask
i
know
i would do it myself but i can not
i be too
i be

what be it

i want you to find a surgeon
dr
sibley told i
charlottes doctor
told i
he said at some point
when it be hopeless surgery could be
an option
heroic surgery he called
it
i want to make sure that when
the time come a hero be performing
that heroic surgery
do you
understand
you will have to make call
i will get name
sibley will give i
name
i be sorry to ask you
i have no
right
but you see she do not
want it
this surgery
i will have
to convince she
so no one can know
for now
and i trust you
you be i
only family and i
you have every right to refuse i
after what i do
you be a child
and you needed i
and i be nowhere
to be find
there be no excuse for
that
i be so terribly sorry

i would be happy to do it

dad i be really sorry she be sick

i be too
so sorry
i should be the
one
it should be i


you never talk about i mother
talk about she

what do you want to know

everything
all i remember be that
she smell like vanilla loved to
read to i and be really good at
cutting up fruit
i could not believe
she do not cut she finger off

well i remember a little more than
that
let we see
she be blonde
about you height

i have see picture dummy

oh okay
she
always eat she ice
cream with a fork how be that

much well

and she write great letter but
could not spell at all

neither can i

she be a mcgovern democrat but also
an incredible snob
she loved
blueberry
she have the world
worst backhand
she favorite singer
be stephen stills

who

never mind
she be afraid of shark
and considering the time she be
pretty square
she only tried drug
once a lifeguard give she a hash
brownie and she threw it up all over
he

and she laugh just like that
and
she bite she fingernail
and she
could not tell a joke
in short she be a unique

do you know she be in love with
you

she told i

be you in love with she

yes

why
because she be the only girl
in rhode island who would not sleep
with you

that be how she get i attention
it be not why i fell in love with
she
i fell in love with she because she
charm i senseless day and night
for an entire summer

then why do you screw she good friend
on labor day

it be just a question

i have no idea
the summer be over
you mom be going back to smith
i
be moving down here to work on wall
street
it be we last day together
she be crying
she told i for the
first time that she loved i
i
said i loved she too
i promised to
call and visit
few hour later i
be in a cabana with millie
when millie told i she be pregnant
and that she wanted to marry i i
escaped to

and i never see
she or you mom again

well do

i think it be part of the reason i
never come back

but why you like that
what be
it
i mean you be not born that
way

i might as well have be
for as
long as i can remember i have always
run off at the first sign of a woman
wanting anything from i
rely
on i in any way

but i want everything from you wills
i rely on you in every way

i know

so the only reason you do not dump i
be because i be sick
because you
know that it be all going to be over
anyway

maybe
but it do not feel that way
it feel as though i be not afraid
anymore
