only once at redstone

where



that be one more time than any of
the rest of we have see it

shit
we be fucked

relax pooch it be just a ticker

mousetrap that be good than we be

stop it

shut up


be nice pooch

all of you shut the fuck up

bunch of
punk

reilly walk out
reilly go to he studebaker climb in
as he start it up the passenger door rip open
glass
jump in slam the door furious

nice performance back there
where do you
learn that mike ditka sensitivity seminar

hey look

no you look mister
first you do not go
calling i man name
it be bad for morale
second we punk happen to know a heck of
alot more about police work than any vice cop
ever do

oh yeah
prove it

drive
glass glare a challenge
glare back reilly gun the
engine screech away
the studebaker rumble up to the machine shop park in the
same haunt spot as the night before
glass and reilly climb out of the car flashlight in hand
reilly glance around bad memory stirring up


the place have already be comb
forensics
pull over a hundred set of print inside

then let we go see what they missed
pull out a tool kit glass quickly pick the door lock
yank open the door duck inside
reilly follow
nearly pitch dark inside shaft of late afternoon sunlight
glisten on the batter machine
shadow wash over reilly
and glass as they retrace the path reilly and rice take the
night before glass searching intensely reilly get more
and more uncomfortable

so what be they do here

i do not know
you tell i

an abandoned machine shop
nice place to
build device
low rent too
but you and
rice ruined they perfect hideout

you mention something called redstone

Redstones the army train center in alabama
where they send the cream of the crop to learn
about ticker

cream of the crop huh
you


top of i class at west point thank you very
much
then off to redstone
first half of
the course we learned how to build device
second half we would take they apart
everything
from firecracker to hydrogen bomb

sound like terrorist heaven

there be a few guy in i class with name
like john smith bill jones
i would see they up
ahead in the hall call they name but they
would not turn around

i

funny thing
they would always disappear after the first half
of the course

just how easy be it to build a
device

with a little train you could go into a
house and just from stuff in the bathroom and
kitchen make something that would finish off that
allege car of yours
heck do not you ever
watch MacGyver
cont

so this be where it happen

girl be here
the guy in charge be over
there with one of he man the other one be
back there

cont

bomber what kettle of fish be
they

typical profile usually loser nobody
that afraid to confront they victim
they like scaring people
that be why they
call in they threat
same mentality as
obscene phone caller

except they will blow you up if you
do not play along

no ninetyninety percent of they be full of
baloney
they be into the power trip not the
damage
what scare i be that this guy be so
sophisticated he could blow up whatever he
want then disappear
the bad of the
bunch they love the challenge of create the
wild device ever
and they love the
carnage
cont
