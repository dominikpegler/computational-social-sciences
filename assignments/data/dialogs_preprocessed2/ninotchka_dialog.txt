be in a hotel like that

they tell i when you ring once the
valet come in
when you ring twice

and we have no right to change the
order of we superior

where be you courage comrade

and now you be afraid
to take a room with a bath

step back into
the taxi
i do not want to go to siberia

i do not want to go to the hotel
terminus

if lenin be alive he would say
Buljanoff comrade for once in
you life you be in paris
do not be
a fool
go in there and ring three
time


he would not say that
what he would
say be Buljanoff you can not afford
to live in a cheap hotel

the prestige of the bolshevik mean
anything to you
do you want to live
in a hotel where you press for the
hot water and cold water come and
when you press for the cold water
nothing come out at all
phooey

if this be mean to be a joke it be
not funny
or do you still think
you be issue order from you palace
in petrograd

i palace in petrograd
yes you
take that away from i
you take
away i czar i country i people
everything i have
but nothing more i warn you

people cannot be taken away madame
neither a hundred and sixty million
nor one
not if you have they love
you have not
that be why you be not in
russia any longer and that be why
you come here this morning

very interest i dear but
could not you write all that from
moscow
dissertation on love on
soviet stationery would be an
amuse paradox

it be not enough to be witty madame
people grow tire of be
entertain
you make that mistake
before
problem be never solve
by bowing from a balcony

i dear you do not know how impressive
i could be
do you ever see i in
i regalia with i diadem and all i
jewel

you can not deny we give the people
they money worth almost
eight tumble Romanoffs eight

i must insist that you leave

not before you agree to use those
reservation to moscow

in that case i can only say goodby

elysee

i would not waken leon
after last
night i would say not before three
of the clock at the early

i told you to go madame

believe i leon can not help you
he
do not know anything about the
jewel
i give you i word
i
swear it

where be they

you be very careless with we
precious jewel i dear
they be
too expensive a toy for two child
to play with

where be they

do not worry
fortunately last night
a very trustworthy friend keep his
eye open
perhaps he overstep
he function as a waiter but he
fulfilled he duty as a russian
she draw back the
fur scarf she be
wearing revealing a
diamond star one of
the jewel we have
see
i just put this on for sentiment
the rest be absolutely safe
i assure
you
but if you feel like notify
the police

you leave i no choice

will not it be rather embarrass for
a soviet envoy to disclose the
circumstance under which she lost
they

i will have to face the consequence
but so will you
do not forget they
will ask how you get they

that be very simple to answer
they
be given to i by i mother
they
be given to she by she mother in
fact they be mine you cannot steal
what belong to you

they always belong to the russian
people
they be paid for with they
sweat they blood they live and
you will give they back

i told you we have plenty to talk
about
shall we sit down

now let we free ourselves from
emotionalism and try to solve the
problem in a practical way
we
situation have changed considerably
before i have only a claim to the
jewel
now i have the jewel

in other word moral idea have no
weight with you
all right then
let we deal with legal fact
you
know that france have recognized the
soviet

unfortunately

under soviet law the jewel belong
to the state
france be going to
uphold that ownership

i lawyer agree with you
he say
france will uphold it in every court
but i will drag you through every
court do not forget that
and when i
say it will take two year i be as
always conservative

will not those two year in court be
expensive for you
i know that money
be no object as long as you could
squeeze it from the pocket of the
people but now

i may run out of money but you have
already run out of bread
two year
be a long time for you comrade to
wait

i see
you have calculated in term
of hunger

no i just wanted to be absolutely
impartial
both of we be face with
two rather uncomfortable year
we
can condense these two year to two
minute if you want to accept i
proposition
Ninotchka now realize
what she be after

go on

i be will to hand over the jewel
and sign the necessary paper if you
take that fiveforty plane to moscow

that be not the way to win he back
not leon

i think i know leon quite as well as
you
possibly a little good
leave that worry to i
Fiveforty
leaf you time enough to close the
deal with monsieur mercier but
naturally you will be too busy for any
farewell
i will see to it that
everything be do in the most
expeditious manner and i will also
see you to the airport

serious
how could you frighten i

middle class

word be a wonderful safety valve
and that be what you need because
you know it be impossible do not you
