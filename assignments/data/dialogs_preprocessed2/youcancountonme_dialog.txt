we be suppose to write a story for
english homework but they do not
tell we what it be suppose to be
about

what do you mean

i mean they do not tell we what it be
suppose to be about
they said do
whatever you want

so what be wrong with that

nothing
i just think it be
unstructured

well i be sure you will be able to
think of something
if you can not
i will help you

do not forget you backpack

it be not a backpack it be a knapsack

do not forget you knapsack

give i a kiss

guess who be be asking for you

oh no really

yeah come in

mr
everett

yeah
brian

brian
hi
i be samantha prescott
i be the lend officer

yeah hi how be you
come on in
sit down

i be so sorry i be late

yeah we missed you before

i get hold up
believe i it be not
something i make a habit of

i be sure it be not
actually could
you just could you close that door
for i
thanks

so i always just run out at

to pick he up and then run he real
quick over to the sitter house
anyway larry never minded about it
and i be just hope it would be
with you too

well samantha i realize that
Scottsville be not exactly a major
bank center

no it be not

no i know it be not
but it be
kind of a personal challenge to i
to see what we can do to bring local
service up to the same kind of
standard we would be trying to meet if
we be the big branch in the
state
and that mean i do not want
anybody running out at
or

or whenever the bus happen to come
in that day
now be there anybody
else who can pick you son up after
school
do you husband work in
the area
do you

oh no rudy sr
be not on the
scene
so to speak

well i can give you a couple of
day to make some other arrangement
but

well brian
i understand what
you be saying and i think it be great
i do
because there be a lot of thing
around here that could use some
attention
believe i
but i have
honestly be meeting that bus every
day for four year now and it really
do take just fifteen minute and
if i take the time out of i lunch
hour

i would really prefer it if you would
make some other arrangement


i will do i good

how old you son

he be eight

that be a terrific age

you get a letter from uncle terry

what

whose room be he going to stay in

he can stay in the little room
but you know what
he be not going to
live here
he be only going to stay for
a little while
and it be if you
do not remember he because you be
only six the last time he be here
but it will be nice if you get a chance
to get to know each other a little
bit
do not you think

rudy
would it distract you if i put
on some music

no

do you think of a story

uh huh

what be it about

i father

what about you father

it be just a madeup story about he

can i read it when you be do

it be not very good

do not say that

anyway bob it be sort of this
adventure story and Rudys father
be this secret agent or something
working for the government
and it
just make i feel weird
you know
because i never really say much to
he about rudy sr
because i do not
know what to say
and i do not know
whether i should just let he imagine
whatever he want to imagine or
whether i should sit he down sometime
and tell he you know that he
father be not such a nice person
you know

well
i do not know sammy
what
have you tell he already

not much
he know i do not have the
high opinion of he
and he know
i do not want to see he or know
anything about he ever
but i tried
to keep it kind of neutral
anyway
i could go into a lot more detail
believe i

well
it be an interesting problem
but i do not really know what to tell
you
it be a little outside i
personal field of expertise

all right

i would be glad to give it some think



what

nothing
i be just glad to see you
i be glad you called i

i bet you be surprise

um a little

i should get going

up all this bullshit against i and
they threw i in the pen for three
month

trauma and i get this
wounded little i have let you down

uh well that be not really he
problem sammy

oh really
what be he problem

he problem be that he be like totally
shelter because you treat he like
he be three instead of eight so
that be how he behave

oh yeah
and how do you think he
should behave

i think he should not have to run and
tell he mommy every time he do
something she might not like for
one thing

uh huh
and what do you

i mean i take he to play pool
it
be a little clandestine thing we

secret i mean who care

but he be so freak out that he
disobey you order that he have to
fuckin squeal on i and i have to
listen to you fuckin shit all day
when i do not even fuckin do
anything

first of all he do not tell i
anything
darryl do

second of
all i do not really give a shit if
you take he to play pool
i be mad
at you because you left he standing
at the bus stop in the rain
but no
i do not want you telling he not to
squeal because i do not want he put
in that position

well
that
be a perfect example
of what i be talking about

you be in idiot

darryl told you

yes

yeah good morning

the door

listen i just

brian that be enough


sorry

you be awfully quiet

i be sorry

um
have you think at all about
what i said

of course i have be think about
it

so
any decision
or do you
still want to think about it some
more

well i mean i do not know bob
i mean we have not exactly be going
steady the last few month if you
know what i mean

yeah no i know

and then we see each other twice
and you suddenly say you want to get
marry
i mean

no you be right you be right

what be you talking about

i do not know
i
maybe this be
last year i sort of thought you be
possibly interest in that
idea
but i be the one who you know
be not ready at that point so
that be why i think thing kind of
slow down with we

do not make i feel bad for you

i do not want you to feel bad for i

hello

it be brian

brian
where be you

i be buying milk
i just think i would
say hello

look i know it be probably too late
but be there any way you can come
out for a little while

brian i think you be going crazy

i know i be
can you meet i

um

um i have to go out for a minute
do you want anything

like what

i do not know

where be you going

yeah where be you going

i just have to go out for a little
while

where

yeah where

i just have to go to Mabels house

why

you know what rudy
it be personal
this be a personal matter that have
to do with mabel
i just have to go
see she for a little while

listen
listen
i be sorry i said you
squeal on i
i be totally out of
line and i really owe you an apology
do you hear what i said

i do not care

what be on you mind sammy

well a lot
but principally
i
be just wonder if you have an
opinion
if you know someone in
you family or just someone you
really care about and they just
can not seem to get ahold of
themselves

you know who this be for

i

that be right i little friend
hello
we be going fish

i get a new rod and reel five lure
i get a hat i get a knife and i get
a fish scaler

that be great honey

i will get it

well
i be not really sure why you be
here ron
i mean i realize i have not
exactly be a model citizen since i
get here but compare to how thing
have be going for i lately i
think i be do pretty well

and i also find it kind of
discouraging that you seem to think
i need some kind of spiritual
counseling or what have you so much
so that you be will to disregard
the fact that i do not believe in any
of this stuff at all

well
i do not mean to discourage
you

i mean it be really kind of insulting

can i say something here
sammy ask i to come and talk to
you because it be she opinion that
you be not going to find what you be
looking for the way you be looking
for it

how would she know

but i be really not here to try to
get you to do anything or to believe
anything
and i will tell you the same
thing i told she which be that as
far as i be concern the only way
she can help you be by she example
by trying to be a model for you by
the way she life she life

and that do not mean she be suppose
to be a saint either if that be
what you be smile about

i do not realize i be smile

you know terry a lot of people
come to see i with all kind of
problem
drug alcohol marital
problem sexual problem health
problem

great job you get

well
i like it
because even in
this little town i feel like what i
do be very connected with the real
center of people live
i be not
saying i be always mr
effective but
i do not feel like i life be off to
the side of what be important
you
know
i do not feel i happiness and
comfort be base on closing i eye
to trouble within myself or trouble
in other people
i do not feel like a
negligible little scrap float
around in some kind of empty void
with no sense of connectedness to
anything around i except by virtue
of whatever little philosophy i
can scrape together on i own

well

can i ask you terry
do you think
you life be important

you mean like i personally i
individual life

yeah

well
i be not sure what do you
mean
it be important to i
i guess
and like to i you know the people
who care about i

but do you think it be important

i

do you think it be important in the
scheme of thing
not just because
it be yours or because you be
somebody brother
because i do not
really get the impression that you
do

well i do not think
i do not
particularly think anybodies life
have any particular importance besides
whatever you know whatever we
arbitrarily give it
which be fine
i mean we might as well
i think
i be as important as anybody else

i do not know
lot of what you be
say have a real appeal to i ron
lot of the stuff they told we when
we be kid
but i do not want to
believe something or not believe it
because i might feel bad
i want to
believe it because i think it be true
or not
i would like to think that i
life be important
or that it be
connected to something important

well be not there any way for you to
believe that without calling it god
or religion or whatever term it be
you object to

yes
i believe that

so sammy what example will you be
setting for we tonight

what time be we get up to go
fish

we be not going fish

what do you mean

why not

i think you should go fishing with
father ron

i do not want to go fish with father
ron

well i be not takin you

i will take you sweetie

i realize that you be mad at i

i be not mad at you

but he do not do anything to you
and you cannot promise a little boy
that you be going to

i just you know after all that
religious conversation i just
realized it be probably not so good
for he to be spending so much time
with someone like i who do not
believe he life be important in the
scheme of thing

would you please

i be serious

listen
i be sure if you put you mind to
it you can think of some other way
of get back at i besides this
so would you please just give it
some thought and take he fish
tomorrow

i would sammy i just do not think
it would be good for he

you suck

hello

hello

anyway
i do not know what the
church position be on adultery and
fornication these day but i feel
really hypocritical not saying
anything to you about it before
so
what be the official position
on that stuff these day

well
it be a sin

good
i think it should be

but we do not tend to focus on
that aspect of it right off the bat

why not

well

i think you should

well

maybe it be good when you come in
and they scream at you for have
sex with you marry boss and be
really mean to you and told you
what a terrible thing it be
maybe
it would be good if you told i how
i be endanger i immortal soul
and if i do not quit i be going to
burn in hell
do not you ever think
that

um
no

well it be a lot good than all
this why do you think you be in
this situation psychological bullshit
you hear all the time

well
why do you think you be in
this situation

with which one

all of they

i feel sorry for they
be not that ridiculous

i have never be so bore in i life

yeah
we really shoulda be out
here around seven or eight


what time be it now

Twothirty

be i father a good fisherman

yeah you father be good at all
that stuff
he know everything about
the wood everything about fish
everything about hunt and
everything about car
if he be not
such a pain in the ass he would have
be a lot of fun to be around

maybe he be nice now

i doubt it

well i think he be

how would you know
do you ever
meet he

no

be you ever curious to meet he

i guess so

well he do not live very far from
here

i think he live in alaska

no i live in alaska
you dad
live in auburn
far as i know
we could look he up in the phone
book
want to try

all right

to say this but i be not kidding
man
do not tell you mother

do you want to go for a walk or a
drive
it be really nice out

no
i be not going to stay long
bob i
do not want to get marry



i have really think about it a lot
and if you have ask i last year
i be sure i would have say yes

oh
thank you

but i be not sure it would have be
a good idea then either
i be going
through a really hard time right now
and i just think that get engaged
to you or anyone would be just about
the stupide most selfdestructive
thing i could possibly do



and i really think you have to grow
up

well how about we fix up i
personality some other time


i really hope we can still be friend
