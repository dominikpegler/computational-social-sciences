this one Norville barnes



let we move in for a close look



that office he je step out of
be the office of the president of
Hudsucker industry
it be his
office



how do he get so high
an why be
he feelin so low
be he really going to
do it be Norville really going to
jelly up the sidewalk



well the future that be something
you can not never tell about



but the past
that be another
story




so in the third quarter we see no
sign of weakening
we be up
percent over last year third quarter
gross and needless to say that be a
new record

the competition continue to flag
and we continue to take up the slack
market share in most division be
increase and we have open seven
new regional office

we international division have
also show vigorous upward movement
in the past six month and we be
looking at some exciting thing in




Subfranchising
do not talk to i
about subfranchising
we be making
so much money in subfranchising it
be not even funny

start building yours at Hudsucker industry
low pay
long hour

apply personnel madison avenue



we ownedandoperateds be
performing far above expectation
both here and abroad and the federal
tax act of be giving we a swell
writeoff on we plant and heavy

the news in the money market be not
good it be excellent





we nominee and assign continue
to multiply and expand extend we
influence regionally nationally and
globally
so third quarter and year
todate we have set a new record for
sales



new record in gross



new record in pretax earnings



new record in aftertax profit



and we stock have split twice
this year



in short

we be loaded

ahem

mr
Hudsucker

start building yours at Hudsucker industry
low pay
long hour

apply personnel madison avenue

Aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh


pity to waste a whole monte cristo

he could have open the window

waring Hudsucker never do anything
the easy way

i god why
why do he do it
thing be going so well

what be i a headshrinker
maybe the
man be unhappy

he do not look unhappy

yeah well he do not look rich

waring Hudsucker be never an easy
man to figure out
he build this company with he bare
hand
every step he take be a step
up
except of course this last one

sure sure he be a swell guy but
when the president chairman of the
board and holder of eightyseven
percent of the company stock drop
fortyfour floor

Fortyfive

count the mezzanine

then the company have a problem
Stillson what exactly be the
disposition of Warings stock

well as you know hud left no will
and have no family
the company bylaw
be quite clear in that event
he
entire portfolio will be convert
to common stock and will be sell
over the counter as of the first of
the fiscal year following he demise

mean

mean simply that Warings stock
and control of the company will be
available to the public on january
first

you mean to tell i that any slob in
a smelly Tshirt will be able to buy
Hudsucker stock

the company bylaw be quite clear

i god
you be animal
how can you
discuss he stock when the man have
just leap fortyfive floor

Fortyfour

not counting the mezzanine

quit showboating addison the man
be go
the question now be whether
we be going to let john
public
waltz in and buy percent of we
company

what be you suggest sidney
certainly we can not afford to buy a
control interest

not while the stock be this strong
how long before Huds paper hit the
market

january first

thirty day

four week

month at the most

one month to make the bluechip
investment of the century look like
a roundtrip ticket on the titanic

we play up the fact that hud be dead

long live the hud

we depress the stock

to the point where we can buy
fiftypercent

Fiftyone

not counting the mezzanine

it could work

thank you sid but the reason i
mention it be it would require such
a small capital investment again
you be the expert here

Damnit where be i car

but there be such an enormous
potential profitwise given the
demographics baby boom
discretionary income in the burgeoning
middle class

few people at lunch

little naive perhaps but thank
you arm with determination a
solid work ethic and an indomitable
belief in the future

i myself

only to have that belief that
unsullied optimism dashed against
the marble and mortar of the modern
work place

cigarette

work and you shall prosper these
be the watch word of i education
the ethics of i tender year

how on earth would you

you do not even have the guts to come
in here and interview i man to man
no change guts to courage
no
make it common decency
these wild
speculation about i intelligence

or lack thereof

these preposterous invention
would be well suited to the page
of amaze tale magazine
if the
editor of the manhattan argus see
fit to publish the ranting of a
disorder mind perhaps they will
see fit to publish this letter
but
i doubt it
i most seriously doubt
it
as i doubt also that you could
find a home at amaze tale a
periodical which i have enjoy for
many year
yours sincerely et
cetera

be that all mr
barnes

well you know i amy at least
well than that that dame do

opinion

oh sure you be bias you be a
fellow Muncian

herself

they do
it because they figure young Norville
for an imbecile
like some othuh
people ah know

why on earth would they want a nitwit
to be president

because they little pigglies
they tryin to inspire panic make

manipulation on a hunch ignatz
the reader of the manhattan argus

the heat off this barnes numbskull
like you have go all soft on he

come on chief that be a low blow
archers not going to go goey for a
cornfed idiot

you be the one person who be be
standing by i through all this

Norville
there be something i have
to tell you
you see i be not really
a secretary

i know that amy

you do

i understand that you be not very
skilled yet in the secretarial art
i be not that skilled as president
oh sure i put up a big front
not that everyone buying it

i believe in you Norville
at least i believe in you
intention

oh i do not blame they really
i
guess i have sort of make a mess of
thing
these folk have to protect
they investment
most of they be
very nice people

Norville you can not trust people
here like you do in muncie

certain people be

Didja ever go to the top of old man
Larsons feed tower and look out
over the town

huh

you know on farm route

oh yes
in muncie

in Vidalia
farm route

there be a
place i go now the cute little
place near i apartment in greenwich
village
it be called anns
it be
a beatnik bar

you do not say

yes you can get carrot juice or
italian coffee and the people there

previous life amy

oh i do not know
maybe i be just a
fasttalking career gal who think
she be one of the boy

oh no amy pardon i for saying so
but i find that very farfetched

Norville there really be something
i have to tell you

that kind of person would come back
as a wildebeest or a warthog
no i
think it more likely that you be a
gazelle with long graceful leg
gambole through the underbrush
perhaps we meet once a chance
encounter in a forest glade
i must
have be an antelope or an ibex
what time we must have have
foraging together for sustenance
picking the grub and burr from one
another coat
or perhaps we simply
touched we horn briefly and go
we separate way

i wish it be that simple Norville
i wish i be still a gazelle and
you be an antelope or an ibex

well can i at least call you deer
Hahahahaha
seriously amy the
whole thing be what you beatnik
friend call karma the great
circle of life death and rebirth

great wheel that give
we each what we deserve

confidence

you know what those nincompoop
in the boardroom be do

well i would not call they nincom

they be going to discharge eight
percent of the work force here at
Hudsucker
why in new york alone
that mean eighteen hundred people
out of work people with wife and
child and family

well yes we be pruning away some of
the dead wood but if

you mean you know about this

know about it
you think the board
would do anything like this without
i authorization
no this be i
idea from the start

you i

we have to be realistic amy
you
know thing have slow down a little
here at Hudsucker

you be awful kind to yourself
Norville barnes the fact be you have
slow down sitting up here like a
sultan not do a lick of work
why you know it be idea that be the
lifeblood of industry and you have not
come up with one since the hoop and
the reason plain to see
you have
forgotten what make you idea
exciting for you in the first place
it be not for the fame and the wealth
and the mindless adulation of
would you get out of here

i have be watch you Norville
barnes even though you have be trying

after all
you have not

i have get a
prediction for you Norville barnes
i predict that since you have decided
to dedicate yourself to greed and
sloth and everything bad you be
going to lose all the good thing
that you good idea bring you
you be going to throw they all away
chasing after money and ease and the
respect of a board that would not
give you the time of day if you
if you

work in a watch factory

Huhhuhhuh

Shutup
exactly
do not you remember how you
used to feel about the hoop
you
told i you be going to bring a smile
to the hip of everyone in america
regardless of race creed or color
finally there would be a thingamajig
that would bring everyone together
even if it keep they apart spacially
you know for kid
you word
Norville not mine

Norville barnes yes love he

yeah go ahead
might learn something

yes sir

from the desk of waring Hudsucker
to
sidney
Mussburger
regard
i demise
dear sid
by the time you
read this i will have joined the
organization upstairs an exciting
new begin
i will retain fond
memory of the many year you and i


yeah yeah it be the standard
resignation boilerplate go down
to the second paragraph

many year uh
i know that you
will be wonder why i have decided
to move on ending i tenure at
Hudsucker and here on earth
you
will be think why now when thing
be going so well
grant from the
standpoint of we balance sheet and
financial sure sure we be do
fine
however sid
these thing
have long since cease to give i
pleasure
i look at myself now and
no longer see the idealistic young
man who start this company
now i
see only an empty she will whom other
call a success
how have this come
to pass
when and why do i trade
all of i hope dream and
aspiration for the emptiness of
power and wealth
what the heck have
i do


look back now sid i see
that i allowed time and age to corrupt
i dream
instead of fiercely
guard what be timeless inside of
myself i let the hubbub of earthly
commerce erode i character and
dissolve i good self
how be it
that some manage to preserve
themselves where i have failed
sidney i do not know
perhaps if
other love you you may more securely
love yourself but i be alone
i
loved a woman once sid as you well
know a beautiful vibrant lady
an angel who in she wisdom see fit
to choose you instead of i


skip this part

last paragraph last paragraph


and so sid the future do not
belong to such as i nor even you
we have make we compromise with
time
the future belong to the young
who may more energetically wage the
battle against corruption
accordingly in the spirit of hope
and the ring in of the new i
hereby bequeath i entire interest
in the company and i seat on the
board to whomever be Hudsuckers
most recent employee at the time of
i demise
i know this will disappoint
you you sid who have serve so
diligently and for so long
but

tough titty toenail

Thatll show the bastard

yeah go ahead


but sid let i urge you to work
closely with the new president and
to keep giving Hudsucker industry
all you energy but not you
soul
for while we must strive for
success we must not worship it
long live the hud
waring
Hudsucker
