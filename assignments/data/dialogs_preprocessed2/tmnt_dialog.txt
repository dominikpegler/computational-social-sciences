as if following the star
pattern the as we find ourselves going into

Pantera slothfully grin
he lean
forward and yank an from she neck

after all the jungle can be a very
dangerous place

they jump into the jeep and tear into the jungle


the jeep clamors down the bumpy makeshift path
Pantera sit
in the passenger seat as the other be cram in around the
food
the jungle loom ominous around they

as we watch the jeep from the jungle ceiling
high above
as if from someone

of a flurry of fist and foot attack

heart

excitement on the inside
and
you will live the most reward life
of all



and so yet again police official
be baffled at a crime of
retribution that can only be
attribute to the mysterious figure
ikey light up

this be the late in a string of
vigilante act that have be
plague the city for the past
year



although the victim have be
criminal themselves the
Nightwatchers action have be
identified as destructive and
overlyviolent
verge on the
edge of lethal

now that be what i be talking about
cruise the street bust those
who hold themselves above the law
but they be not above

mikey the mane practically a
criminal himself
anyone who
operate without boundary or rule
of law cannot be legislate and
need to be reign in

incarceration of those who deserve
it but if someone like
Nightwatcher have ultimate power
then who make sure he do not
cross the line

i think he be

of course you would

Keeya


sometimes there be line that even
the police can not cross
someone have
to be will to do what need to
be do
and to do that fear
become a weapon

you be such a neanderthal

way to argue you point then
perhaps you do not have much of a
point to begin with

and be not really an indication of
fear
Raph do the blah blah hand gesture from above

hello max
this be i
friend casey jones



chris
how be it going

actually it be ca

so how be you trip

you know the typical corrupt
government official double
cross by a jungle guide all
ending in a heartpounding chase

but it be all worth it
beat excite
i find it
the fourth general

Yeahha
the fourth general

the crowbar

oh

the god be praise



can i ask you a question


es
of course

i have be so grateful for the
opportunity you have given i
lately
i would probably be still
selling antique curio if you
have not visit i shop that day
but i have to ask
why the
fascination with these particular
works of art
i would never even hear
of the legend of Yaotl until we
meet
he look up
the cam
it travel past an
in the
go to
continue until we be in


the armor become the back of a
camera dolly
around the helmet until we be looking at a dark and impose
figure

he helmet be impenetrable with eye slit
note the flashback be dark shadow and monochromed
detail be hint at instead of show
very stylize



it be a time long before the
mayan april
long before the
aztec and even the olmecs
it be
a time of legend
time of
greatness
the true mother culture
of central america
cool shot of Yaotl
he armor he stance etc



there be a man named Yaotl
more a
force of nature than man
and
together with he four warrior
priest general they pillage
every culture in they path

the walk along side Yoatl
possibly slomo
we will come to recognize they through they
distinct armor as the four stone general in human form



and for every culture they
destroyed they drink in all the
magic and knowledge known to they


they become a warring hurricane
gathering more power and knowledge
with each conquest



then they come across a culture
rich with science magic and they
own technology
south american
version of atlantis


it be like blood in the water for
a predator like Yaotl



as the army approached Yaotl used
the knowledge they would gain in
black magic and sorcery
time
they attack with the alignment of
the star of Kikin they opened a
portal to another world



they unleashed an army of monster
man get slaughter in a nice sort



the monster know no side they
destroyed the enemy
as well as
Yaotls own army
man who swear to
spill they blood for he because
Yaotl have to do something to stop
more from coming through
inters the portal stopping the slew of monster





desolate destroy battlefield
smoldering
body
everywhere
no monster
end pan on Yaotl on he knee



in the end there be no victor
and they be responsible for the
eradication of the great culture
that will never be known
the
knowledge that be lost would never
be find again

casey have fallen asleep sit to the side head in his
hand
line of hang from he mouth
april be
fascinated by the story
she nudge casey who do the
slurphalfsnore wake up


i be just resting i eye

concern re
statue
you do not think that this could be

oh no miss ONeil

inters do not break he stare

one of the girl will pay you fee
on the way out

thanks
um

max
april and casey leave winters consume with he new
treasure

the chance to become a good man

dangerously close to the vase

dark of shadow
the slink forward clearly a

woman dressed in cloak and japanese noh mask over she face
he take it off revealing the beautiful leader of
the japanese foot clan flank by three

so down to business aside from
the other reason for you visit to
america be you interest in i
offer we discuss

i must confess
i still do not
know exactly what we be to do for
you

i need the finelytuned eye and
stealth of you foot ninja to
monitor the city for i over the
next few day
winters walk to he window
it be night
overlook the city

just keep you eye peeled for
anything

the glow eye be really a
the same line pattern we
see at movie open
the star
lining up in a more
straightlined manner
placing we back in


walk down the sidewalk
as he pass a
he hear a low come from it
he stop
as the man look in
can not see a thing
handheld
cam
he move to leave
and the growl come again
man stare in
no one on the street
look close
closer
grow more tense as


the requisite jump out of the shadow
scare
man half to death


give i a scare kitty
he pet the kitty a bit then walk off
behind
cat as man walk off into the distance
until

large burly slam out of the shadow
onto the cat yank it back into the alley
quick
caterwaul
silence
and then we hear a

**further/far through the asphalt then quickly hook up
with an air duct pipe
zip fast and fast until we be in


leo feverishly work out
he stop looking up panting

trigger a reaction in the stone itself
music build as we see quick shot of the granite crack

camera travel with the rise glow
end on a pair of suddenly come to life
red glow



the boy stand high atop the city below
ready to run a
gauntlet of rooftop hazard

who be

aph try to turn the table and attack the creature
the

nice of you ta join i



what
i see it on a nature show
once


as a large teetering pallet filled with

silent
the turtle start to regain
consciousness
moonlight shoot in as they move the rock and
stand up groggy
through the smoke we can see silhouette
a large hairy shape along with
the
sound of freighter door engine rev and then a
caravan of sort pulling away

chirp
approach the now
destroy site

well hit the tunnel guy
donnie use a small prod to prop open a
don
mike and leo jump in
leo look back Raph be still stewing

Raph
save it for another day

Raph know he have to go
reluctantly he enter the sewer
the
lid close as the alley be illuminated by

beat then mikey barely pop the lid open for another peek



know it be not that bad dude
actually the place be destroyed
dent torn
and looking like a postnight raid in



on the tower
dead of night
no one around


cavernous structure
dimly light
high ceiling
few odd
silhouette here and there
we hear the click of winters shoe echo as he enter

what seem to be the problem
Karai and six ninja be already there

the problem be that we be hired
to merely patrol the city and
report anything strange to you



you never said anything about


so you job duty be just
redefined
congratulations on you
promotion

we may be hired help to you but
you should never forget
we be
the foot clan

Oooooooh

i believe we make a deal Karai
i
expect you to honor it
you do understand honor do not
you

so i do not care what part of
muscle for hire you do not
understand
i hired you muscle
now exercise the one attached to
you foot and
get back to work



so i will double
no no
you pay for you trouble
be we cool

be we
cool

Ninjas
no sense of humor
so how do we fare

so it begin

be there any problem

none i lord

you see now that be a good soldier
you two should compare note



just what be this all about

oh let we call it a scavenger hunt
re
general
i now have the power and knowhow
but i need the speed and stealth of
an organization such as you own
not to mention an organization that
value discretion

but of course

you see i have nine more beast
like this that should be coming to
town very soon
thirteen in all to
be exact

but
why
why here
why now

instinct mostly
they be animal
at they core
and they recognize something
familiar in the air
in the
star
what can i say
i be a lover of
animal


so you go and get to know each
other
and do not forget
play
nice

not now
we business will be
handle at a late time




after they leave we pause for on winters
quiet
tired
contemplative



three brother sit around they breakfast table looking hang
over from the previous night brawl
mikey come in looking
the bad of all and plop into he seat
cam circle table

plate of the thing that hit we last
night
oi i head

creature look familiar

we coulda taken it if you slacker
would have pitch in sooner

fact remains Raph that we should
have never be there in the first
place

mr
Cuddlykins continue to spread
happiness throughout the city

those statue you collected for
that winters guy

i would say that be a big tenfour

it be just a myth
a legend
it can not be



and i suppose that bringing up the
thirtyfoot fly monster would
probably just push this over the
edge huh

what be you talking about casey

told we
it all start down in
south america
long before the
Ashmecks and the macaroon

the molybdenum be of a
grade only find in a few select

so what do we have
we have someone
with a lot of money

access to technology

mean to produce it to exact spec

not to mention have a keen
interest in these monster
and
they four stone joker

if you ask i it all somehow
point to winters corp

how do you figure that donnie

hello
genius

part have a winters corporation logo
on it

recreate the event from back then

well what would you do with an
army of monster

yes however they be usually
mortgage refi company

and fly creature that attacked
i n casey

something more than collecting art

i will work with april and see if
these star of Kikin she told we
about can give we any clue

i say we just storm the castle and
face this jerk in person

Raph that would be the bad idea
yet
we hang back
analyze
formulate a plan storm you
castle
be we clear

Raph
do not do it man
i spent i whole life running out
of room ticked off at the world
i
wish i could take most of em back

and bolt out the door





cam be moving fast
really fast down the pipe
Raph
into frame running fast than we
he lift up a

he pull it open revealing he night gear
as he grab an overhead and flip up and outta sight


we see the same star we have be tracking move closer into
alignment
only now it mean so much more to we

as we find ourselves



donnie look through a thick book on



think this be all of they donnie
april walk in holding a foothigh stack of
yellowed document

i clean out i archive on
ancient south america
might have
find something useful
she take out a handdrawn map

map of the star as recorded by
an aztec shaman
they pinpoint the
location of the star of Kikin
even though the name changed

for use in an aztec calendar
so if we can crossreference we
current star field position of
the star of Kikin and backtrack
position base off of the aztec


along with taking into account the
point of origin of the first
occurrence we should know where
another portal could take place
max what be you up to

leo pace back and forth in the main area
splinter walk in
mikey play video game on the main

fast by wearing a groove in we

other in the process
or that no
one touch you stuff
or make
loud noise when you be trying to
sleep
or
