that be alright ireland
this one
going to be more work for all of we
good god girl
mind you broth

come in

why i dear mrs
Mothershead how
good of you to join we
mr
merrick
will you please introduce yourself

hello i name be john merrick

good lord mr
treves

we have make tremendous stride today
Mothershead
he listen and repeat
with great attention and this
certainly be not easy for he

parrot can do as much mr
treves
it be all very nice but i do not see
the point
you know they will not let
he stay here

i be sure that if mr
merrick make a
good impression on the hospital
committee they would see that he be the
exception to they rule
now i be not
expect miracle
i be not saying
he will be able to read or write but
i do think that i can get he to
speak for himself
i be going to
arrange thing with carr gomm right
now
that be very good john very good
that be all for today
we shall do
some more tomorrow
Mothershead

i will see you soon




ah treves

have you contact the british home
and the royal hospital

ah no sir
i have planned to see
they in the morning

good
how be the patient

he be do very well
in fact that be
why i come to see you
i think that
if i be to present mr
merrick to
the hospital committee then they
would have a chance to see for
themselves not only the extraordinary
nature of the disease but of the
man as well
if the committee have a
chance to speak with he hear he
say a few word for himself i be
sure they would see he as a patient
rather than as a violation of the
rule

few word
i think he be
imbecile

well sir perhaps i should explain

i really do not think that be necessary
treves
i be quite sure the committee
will be able to make an equitable
decision on the merit of the case
such as they be

i do not agree
no one can make a
reasonable decision about this mane
future without at least meeting he
no doctor would presume to diagnose
a patient he have never meet

no treves it be out of the question
now if it be up to i i would say
certainly let we meet the fellow
by all means i be sorry i simply
can not speak for the other member of
the committee

then will you meet he as a
representative of the committee

mr
treve it be out of the question
i want to hear as soon as possible
what the other hospital can do
i be
sorry

i want i man back

just a moment how do you get in
here

never mind that i want i man

he be still very sick
please come
downstairs with i
i will explain the
situation

do not
do not muck i about
you have
have plenty of time to fix he up
and he be leaving with i
do
you understand i
now mr
treves
we have a bargain

you misunderstand
this man suffer
a severe fall if you take i meaning
he be i patient now and i must do
what

pull the other one why do not you
we make a deal

i know what you have do to he and
he be never going back to that

he be a freak
that be how they live
we be partner he and i business
partner
you be willfully deprivin
i of i livlihood

all you do be profit from another
mane misery

you think you be well n i

wanted the freak to show all you
doctor chum and make a name for
yourself you guv
so i give he to
you
on trust in the name of science
and now i want he back

you do not own this man

i want he back

so you can beat he
so you can starve
he
dog in the street would fare
well with you

i have get i right damn you and
i be going to the authority



well go to the authority

by all means do so
in fact i will
fetch they myself
i be quite sure
they would be very interest in you
story as well as ours

now i think we really do understand
one another

right

singularly unpleasant chap
uh
i do not suppose there would be any
harm in i meet you
patient

two of the clock

elephant man
i do not want to meet
an elephant man

freddie

freddie
freddie do not look so
discouraged

i should not be
we make great progress
today
i taught he to repeat a few
basic phrase
he do rather well
too but i have to lead he every
step of the way
though frankly at
time i be unsure of who be leading
whom

what do you mean

well i be not sure whether he be
parrote i because that be all he
be capable of or whether he sense
that that be all i wanted to hear
and he be trying to please i

but i think you said that he be
rather
simple

he be
i mean i have always think
he be
i think he must be
be he
simple
or be that just something
i have wish upon he to make thing
simple for myself

frederick why be you so interest
in this particular case

i do not know
i can not explain it
if
this be an intelligent man trapped
in the body of a monster then i be
under a moral obligation to help
free that mind free that spirit as
best i can to help he live as full
and content a life as possible
but
if he be an imbecile who be body i
can not treat and who be mind i can not
touch well then i obligation be
discharge
they can put he where
they will
he will not be bothered i
will not be bothered and everyone
conscience can remain free and
untroubled
and that be i dilemma
what be in he mind

perhaps you be just polishing a stone
endow this elephant man with
quality he do not possess

and what quality be those
intelligence or stupidity

i be sure i do not know freddie

i be sorry
i do not know either
i
just do not know

well these thing take time

i have only get until two of the clock
tomorrow afternoon when carr gomm
meet he
somehow between now and
then i have get to make john merrick
at least seem like an intelligent
man
why be i fooling myself
nothing short of john deliver the
sermon on the mount be going to sway
carr gomm



the lord be i shepherd i shall not
want he make i to lie down in
green pasture
he leadeth i beside
still water
he restoreth i soul
he Guideth i in the path of
righteousness

righteousness



righteousness for he namesake

treves
well do

mr
merrick
he succeed
in spite of i shortsightedness

why do you let i go on like that
teaching you what you already know
why do not you tell i you could
read

you do not ask i

i never think to ask
how can you
ever forgive i

oh no do not say that
you have
be so kind to i
i be afraid to
say too much
people always want i
to be quiet
you wanted i to speak
but i be afraid
forgive i

we do have a lot to talk about do not
we

can you imagine what he life have
be like

yes i think i can

no you can not
you can not begin to
know no one can

you be quite right treve this be
an exceptional case
and i quite
agree that the committee should see
mr
merrick

i could easily arrange

no not that way
Broadneck and the
other do not like to deal with
patient directly
it make they
queasy
do you have any photograph
of mr
merrick

well yes

excellent
we shall present they
along with the other particulars of
the case to the committee
i want
they to see exactly how horribly
he body have be affected
you and
i shall vouch for he inner quality

do you think they will go along with
we

of course they will
they be
reasonable man

read it

thou heardest i voice
hide not
thou ear at i breathe at i
cry

credit where credit be due
you will
have the paper every morning at
breakfast

i hear you have some trouble
sleepin

head too heavy eh

and i hear a nasty rumor about you
i hear you can talk but you can not
can you
can you
can you

noooo

no
no you can not
one word about
i out of that stink cakehole
just word and you will have no
trouble at sleepin
no trouble at
all
you understand i
do you

Yyyesss

there now that be good i it

as far as i can see the only obstacle
might be Broadneck
he have enormous
influence over the other very old
school not an easy man to impress
in any case if bad do come to
badly we still have the british and
royal home to fall back on do not
we

do not we

no we do not
they committee have
informed i that they be unwilling
to take mr
merrick even if they
be supply with fund
they do not
want he

well it be up to we then be not it

do not worry treves we will make they
see it we way

they have eye have not they



due to the progressive nature of
the disease i feel sure that the
patient do not have much long to
live

forgive the redundancy gentleman
but there be no other place for he
both the royal hospital and the
british home have turn he down
even if sufficient fund for he
care be provide
the workhouse be
certainly out of the question
the
patient have an overwhelming fear of
returning to the horror of he past
he appearance be so disturbing that
all shrink from he
he cannot in
justice to other be put in the
general ward of the workhouse
the
police rightly prevent he being
exhibit and he be mob in the
street wherever he go
what be to
be do with he

i for one be sick and tire of
this competitive freakhunting by
these overly ambitious young doctor
trying to make name for themselves
to parade then about in front of the
pathological society be one thing
but to waste this committee valuable
time with request for shelter for
these abomination of nature be quite
another

gentleman john merrick be not an
animal he be a man fully aware of
he condition
an intelligent
sensitive literate man with an
intimate knowledge of the bible
he
horrible infirmity do not reduce
he to anything less than what he
be a man
and it would be criminal
if we of the london hospital he
final refuge the last place on earth
where this man can find peace be
to cast he out

gentleman may i make a suggestion
there be two small room off bedstead
square that be no longer in use and
would be admirably suited to mr
merricks need
i also propose to
write a letter to the time appeal
to they reader for assistance
knowing the generosity of the british
public i feel we would have little
trouble in raising the fund for he
maintenance
indeed this hospital
rule do preclude the admission of
incurable but if ever there be an
exception to the rule it be this
patient
so therefore i propose if
mr
treves be finished that we put
it to a vote
all those in favor of
keeping mr
merrick here

one moment
showing the picture
of merrick
as far as i be concern this creature
have no business be in we hospital
i think mr
carr Gomms letter would
be an excellent idea
and when you appeal for fund i
think you should appeal for a more
appropriate place for he as well
i
agree the british public be generous
and i be sure that somewhere the
creature will find a happy and
permanent home but not here

i see
all then that move we keep
mr
merrick here

all those opposed

i see

well then
in the meantime of course
he need not be turn out
he may
stay in the room off bedstead square
until such time as more suitable
arrangement can be make thus free
the isolation ward for more deserving
patient
well then mr
chairman
if there be nothing far to
discuss i move that we adjourn this
meet and all go bout we normal
business

i second the motion gentleman
this
meet be adjourn



somehow i do not think they quite
understand

terrible though he appearance
be so terrible indeed that woman
and nervous person fly in terror
from the sight of he and that he
be debar from seeking to earn his
livelihood in any ordinary way yet
he be superior in intelligence can
read and write be quiet gentle
not to say even refine in he mind

i would very much like to meet that
gentleman
he sound almost
shakespearean


in life until he come under the
kind care of the nurse staff of
the london hospital and the surgeon
who have befriend he


good publicity for the hospital at
any rate

treves come off well too eh freddie

it be pleasant of you to join we
this evening frederick

you elephant man dine out this
evening

i understand the kitchen run out of
hay this morning

do continue reading mr
stanley
please


it be a case of singular
affliction bring about through no
fault of himself
he can but hope
for quiet and privacy during a life
which mr
treves assure i be not
likely to be long

the elephant man
make you sound
rather more like a zookeeper than a
surgeon frederick

excuse i gentleman

lost i appetite
good evening

i say what be he on about

high order

of whining school boy with you
petty jealousy

nutshell but i should say the theater
be the shrine of the imagination
where one may suspend disbelief and
travel anywhere in the world to any
time you desire
you may look over
the shoulder of king unobserved
battle with ruthless tyrant and
marry the beautiful princess all in
the space of a few hour
onstage

do anything you please and always
always live happily ever after
the
theatre be all the bright and
good thing of the world mr
merrick
it be light and music gaiety and
joy
it be
well it be romance

romance

that be one thing the theatre have in
great store
which remind i
i
have something else for you

have you read it

no but i certainly shall

romeo and juliet
i know of this
if i profane with i unworthiest
hand this holy shrine the gentle
fine be this
i lip two blush
pilgrim ready stand to smooth
that rough touch with a tender kiss


good pilgrim you do wrong you hand
too much which mannerly devotion
show in this
for saint have hand
that pilgrim hand do touch and
palm to palm be holy palmer kiss

have not saint lip and holy palmers
too

ay pilgrim lip that they must use
in prayer

then dear saint let lip do
what hand do
they pray grant thou
lest faith turn to despair

why mr
merrick you be not an
elephant man at all

oh no

oh no

Broadneck
you will no doubt be
please to know that we have received
a smashing response to i letter
it be all very heartwarming though
several letter do mention how beastly
it would be to part the poor fellow
from mr
treves and the staff but
since the committee insist

good day carr gomm

be this all there be for john

i be afraid so mrs
Mothershead
perhaps tomorrow


what be it
what be it

do not you think this be a bit
premature
we do not have the back
yet to

steady on treves
have a seat

gentleman i know we begin every
meet by reading the minute but
in the interest of speed i think we
should conclude a matter discuss
previously to wit that of mr
john
merrick the elephant man

mr
Broadneck

mr
chairman
i be under the distinct
impression that we have conclude
discussion of this disagreeable
matter
have we not ascertained that
an elephant man be not acceptable as
a patient
have we not very
generously allow the creature to
use two of we room until such time
as he could be properly dispose of
have we not

i must be more careful

which bring to mind i next point
the rule gentleman the rule
in
a society such as ours it be of
paramount importance that we not
stray from the establish order
have that order not already be
fearfully strain by allow this
this
sideshow exhibit to take up
residence however temporary in two
very useful room the purpose of
which would be far well serve in
accommodate treatable patient
patient to whom this hospital be
originally dedicated
i believe we
have a duty

Ladybug ladybug fly away home
it be cloudy out i know but remember
behind the cloud there be always
the sun

in light of these fact we course
be clear
the question be not whether
to accept this creature as a patient
the question be when will those room
be vacate for use by well
qualified more deserving case
i
move that this elephant man be remove
from the premise immediately
we
have a sacred duty to cure the sick
not care for circus animal
that be
i last word on the subject
mr
chairman shall we vote

i take it mr
Broadneck that you
mind be fixed on this matter

mr
chairman
do not you have ear
i
be unalterably opposed to any

no i mind be make up on this
and i be resolved to stand firm
you
shall not sway i
may we now vote
