ms
jones

she be on the train
they will be in
venice in the morning

we target name be alexander
pearce
british citizen born in
london into an ordinary middle
class family
the only thing
remarkable about he childhood be
a preternatural gift for number

which he used to hack into a
computer and fix the test result
he final year at school


you mastermind could not pass his
exam on he own

he do not fix he test score
he
fixed the score for all the girl
in the class
it make he very
popular

what start as school prank
eventually become something much
more serious
after a year in the
train program at goldman sachs
he decided that gamble suited
he well than working for a
live
that in turn involved
he with some rather unsavory
people and ultimately lead he to
put he financial genius to work
in he true call
money
launder

you have assembled quite a task
force to catch a common money
launderer mr
ackerman

there be nothing common about
alexander pearce
quiet simply
he have turn money launder
into an art form
he great
innovation
the false lawsuit

pearce set up two company
one
be a casino in arizona for example
and the other be a she will company
in the cayman islands


the cayman islands company file a
lawsuit against the casino
claiming copyright infringement or
some other complaint
they
succeed in winning the case and
the casino pay the she will company
an enormous settlement

the money travel from america to
the cayman islands

yes but now the money be legal

not quite legal
the i


have
be cheated out of the revenue
we calculate that mr
Pearces tax
bill currently stand at

million dollar

that explain what the american
harridan be do here

Exactement monsieur

mr
pearce have some other debt as
well
most of you will recognize
ivan demidov

pearce launder over a billion
dollar for demidov
at some
point pearce decided he would rather
steal from demidov than help he
steal


given Demidovs tie to organized
crime i would say that be a mistake

the you

government be not
participating in an investigation
of a member of the russian
parliament
we target be
alexander pearce

of course

have mr
pearce ever be in
custody

almost


finally
let we go


this be going to take a few minute

i will be ready in fifteen minute


alexander

where be he


you have nothing to say

get she out of i sight



what do this alexander pearce
look like


nobody know
he disappeared
after he escape
he be have
extensive plastic surgery to alter
he appearance since then
drug
lord amado carillo do the same
thing in the s to successfully
elude authority

how do you know about it

pearce worked with no more than a
few accomplice at one time
he
treated they so well that they be
virtually all completely loyal
none of they would cooperate
we have question the one we could
find and the only thing we
learned be that pearce apparently
arranged it so even he own people
have never see he after the
surgery

so nobody know what he look
like


correct

forgive i for saying so mr
ackerman but he slipped away from
you when you know he whereabouts
and he appearance
what make
you think you can catch he now

he girlfriend be recently
released from custody
he will come
for she
we will be waiting

what make you so certain

he will come for she



i be afraid i would missed you
i
wanted to ask where you be staying
in venice
i be suppose to catch a
shuttle to i hotel but i think
maybe

i have get a good idea

mason

television video radio hi
fi sound system

have you ever be to venice
before

then we need to go out


she be check into the danieli
she be not alone

good
maintain surveillance but keep
you distance


do not try to get clever
remember that pearce be smart
than most of you put together

take a seat mr
quinn
can i
offer you a glass of brunello
it be a

no thank you mr
demidov

you know i would never admit this at
home but vodka be for peasant
there be much we could learn from
the italian


tell i i be not going to be
disappoint

i do not think so

he always have good taste

mr
demidov
if i may ask you a
question
why do you care so much
about alexander pearce
i mean
you have come here yourself
as if
it be personal

it may be difficult for you to
understand mr
quinn
you swiss
be mercenary by nature
but for
some of we there be thing more
important than money
i put i
trust in alexander pearce
he
betrayed that trust

and it be bad business to let
somebody make a fool of you
if
pearce get away with it what
do that say about i



so
when you be not on a grand
european tour what do you do in
Rosemont pennsylvania

i be a teacher
high school math
and you
what do you do

this be what i do frank

you be good at it

oh look
a wedding
how lovely

i be not really into wedding at
this particular moment in i life

oh yes
i forget



do you think it be really over

hmm

maybe she will change she mind
woman do
she might give you a
second chance

i suppose that be a possibility
that be what i tell i statistics
class anyway
life be a game of
chance
endless possibility and
permutation
you just have to
calculate the odds

you have not answer the question

well
i would like to think that love be a
question of destiny not chance

for a moment there you just
remind i of somebody

he have a way of dancing around a
question so eloquently that you
never notice until later that
he would completely avoid the truth
he entire life be wrapped up in
deception
he told so many lie i would not
believe he even if he finally do
tell the truth

he do not sound like much of a
friend


he be not

so why be you wearing he watch

you be smart than you look
frank

and you be right
here take it

what
no i can not
this thing
must be worth a fortune

i insist
you be do i a
favor
take it or i will toss it in the
ocean

i will wear it until you regain you
sense

what

it suit you


i could get used to this


you should leave venice tomorrow
it be a city for lover frank

place to recover from a fail
engagement

criminal

the american embassy
i be going
to tell they that you and you
undercover officer knowingly and
recklessly endangered the life of
an american citizen
let we see
what i government have to say
about that

we be aware of the situation mr
taylor
but we take a long view
of these thing
fortunately you
be unhurt

then i will go to the press
i will
tell the entire story to the new
york time

no
i do not think you will do that

why not

because i do not think you want to
see Caras entire career
destroyed

espresso



woman like cara do not come along
very often

in i case they do not come along
at all

she be the bad combination
stun look and a brilliant
mind

if she be so smart how do she get
catch up with pearce

it start out as a
straightforward placement



we run she deep cover to build a
case against pearce
it take
he
hired she as an assistant



then she begin miss drop
omit important detail


she be no long with we
she
be with he

she explain it now as the
confusion of she new life outside
the academy
that i misread she
capacity for this kind of work

then why be you still use she

she be all i have mr
taylor

you think she will turn he in this
time

i do not know

i do know however that you be
very smite with she

it be not just i be it





cara

have you get he

you mean the idiot who ruined we
operation

have you get he

yes

it be you own fault
we never
should have endangered a civilian
you should have put an agent into
place

there be no time
besides pearce
be too smart for that
he would
have spotted the agent a mile
away

he do not spot i

apparently he do not have to


i be sorry cara

for

i be on edge because of we failure
today
if only the american
have not messed everything up

why would he
risk going back there
he must
know we would be watch

i doubt that
maybe there be
something of value still there
he left in a hurry after all

call in a search team


we search the place after the
raid last year
if there be
anything hidden there only pearce
know where it be

we need to get agent in place all
around the villa

if you be all around he house

keep we distance and wire the
entire villa for video
surveillance

mr
Goyal you may place mr
quinn

you think i do not know
you be unwittingly quite
helpful

after all demidov be not a target
of this investigation be he


there be something i do not
understand
how do pearce manage
to get here and open that safe
without anybody notice
and
where do he go

because pearce be clever than
all of we


million dollar worth of
surgery and that be the face you
choose

it be good to see you too


you really think they will just give
