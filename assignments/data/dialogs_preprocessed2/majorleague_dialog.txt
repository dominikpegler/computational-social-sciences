good morning gentleman
welcome to
another season of indian baseball

i know that it may not seem the same
without donald here this year but i
promise you by the end of the season
this team will have make history

unfortunately there be some in the
press who feel that
reading from the
page
the exshowgirl wife of donald phelps
have no business be the owner of a
major league baseball team


obviously donald do not feel that
way or he would not have left the
team to i
and i be more than
showgirl
i be a dancer
now i
know some of you have doubt about
i ability to run this franchise
god help you if i ever find out about
it

spring train begin in two week
throwing a sheet of
paper on the table
here the list of people we will be
invite to camp this year

i could sit here and tell you what a
great year we be going to have but the
fact be we lost the two good player
we have to free agency
we have not
win a pennant in year
we have not
even finished in the first division
for
obviously it be time to make
some change
what do you think

i never hear of half these guy
and the one i do know be way past
they prime

most of these guy never have a prime

this guy here be dead

cross he off then

let we not be hasty

it be time to shake thing up charlie
clear the board and start over

well it be not the good material
i have ever have to work with but i will
do i good to see we move up a notch
this year

i know you will charlie
that be why
i be movin you up to general manager
congratulations

well that should do it for today
thank you gentleman
let we get to
work

one minute second

mr
donovan mrs
phelps would like
to see you

come on in charlie
have a seat

i be glad you called i in
i be still
unclear on a couple thing

oh really
like what

well if i be the

who be going to
be the manager

i be think of lou brown

lou brown

he be managed the toledo mud hen of
the international league for the
last year

i think he will fit right in with we
team concept

what exactly be we team concept

that be what i wanted to talk to you
about
i want to put together a team
that will help we relocate to miami

what do you mean
refer to the
roster
some of these guy be furniture
mover

i be serious about this charlie
it be no secret i have never like
cleveland much
the weather lousy
downtown be a pit the stadium
falling apart and we can not draw
dick
another couple of year of
this and i be going to have to start
feeding ChaCha dog food

mrs
phelps you can not just up and
move a team on a whim

it be hardly a whim
Miamis offered
to build we a new stadium
capacity
i

box and no
rent for the first million at the
gate
plus a million dollar media
guarantee
percent of the
concession gross all of the park
and they pick up the stadium
operation cost
no other franchise
in baseball can match that deal

even so the Leaguell never let we
leave cleveland
we get a lease with
the city

the lease say we have the right to
move if we attendance fall below
for the year
pushing across a
copy of the lease
paragraph line

if we play bad enough we should be
able to come in under that

what be you saying
you want we to
lose

no we have be losing
what i want
we to do be finish dead last

mister phelps would never have
approved of this

he know it have to be do
he just
do not have the courage to do it
hopefully you will come to see the
wisdom of it
if this team life up to it
potential we could have the bad
record in all baseball

welcome to spring train gentleman
most manager tell you at this time
that all the job be open that

rather see desire and discipline in
a player

most of all they want you to have
fun out there even though they be
going to work you ass off on
fundamental and condition you till
you drop
the difference between i
and those other manager be
i mean it

for what
running back to the dugout

you get to stop swingin for the fence
though hayes
all you be going to do
be give yourself a hernia
with you
speed you should be hittin the ball
on the ground leggin they out
every
time i see you hit one in the air
you owe i twenty pushups

hey no problem

shit

sometimes you can teach a guy to
hit
you can not teach he to run

all right vaughn they tell we you be
a pitcher

lurk the injun nine oh so fine we
love those mighty Redmen turn they
foe to dead man Ummmmm

proud of i situation
mon you

not so loud jake

remember the three night we spent
on the beach in vera cruz

detroit with miss dairy queen

you will always be
the little boy who would not grow up

lynn wait

quarter of the season go we be
and seven game out of first
we attendance be just below
that be bad but not bad enough

projected over the whole season we
stand to wind up game under

and out of first
that should be
bad enough for anybody

we finished out last year and
still draw
when school
out for the summer attendance be
liable to rise
plus this team be
showing sign of improvement
i do not
think we would win game all year
any idea

on how we can get bad
how about a series of fine for good
play
maybe a bonus to the
guy chosen least valuable player

this be no laugh matter donovan
i think maybe the problem be we be
coddle these guy too much


what be with this
we never leave
from this terminal

maybe the other one jammed up

which one be ours

that one


what be this lou

front office say it be an economy
measure because we be not drawin
good

well they certainly have spare
every expense

oh so now you come around
he be not fool

the zipper on you skirt be stick

use you imagination


well i bad fear have be
confirmed
we be and nine
game out of first and only two out
of the first division
who do those
guy think they be

maybe you just have to accept the
fact that they be not as bad as you would
hope

i do not have to accept anything
we
attendance be only beginning to rise
if we can force a lose streak for
a week or two we can still turn
this thing around
the fan be used
to loser here
at the first sign of
a slump they will give up on this team

what be left to do
you have taken away
everything you can

not everything


memo say we will only be usine this
for short trip

good thing we do not play anybody in
europe

can i borrow one of those man
they
do not have any magazine on this
bus

sure go ahead
i think i read
day be over

macbeth
this a good one

pointing to he stack
of classic
these be all hall of Famers

i will trade you song of hiawatha for
the Deerslayer

naw i be not into song of hiawatha

all right then how about crime and
punishment

yeh that sound pretty good
that be
a detective story right

yeh

this be it
the sheffield arm

i do not know if we can survive any
more of these economy measure



so ricky vaughn rough up in his
only other appearance against the
yankee will see what he can do
with the bronx bomber this time
vaughn after a slow start have come
on lately and now lead the american
league in strikeouts with

hey jailbird

throwing the ball
back
mon rick baby settle down

what be the problem rick
you be
throwin basketballs up there
that
guy in the dugout botherin you

naw i be all right

forget he
worry about the guy
carryin bat
mon ricky let we
get nasty

i think now that vaughn have some
control he be ready for the yankee

not quite yet



so vaughn pitch in some tough
luck here as the yankee put together
as few squib hit and take a
lead

well the indian make a gallant
comeback today but fell one run
short as the yankee held on for a
victory although they do not do
squat after the first inning
anyway
if the bus make it here from the
hotel we will be on at
tomorrow
night
till then this be harry doyle
saying so long everybody and happy
hunting

mind if i join you

donovan
hell no
what be you do
here

just wanted to get out on the road
you damn near pulled one out today

someday we will figure out how to beat
those guy

you know you have do a helluva job
this year

sixty and sixtyone be hardly a
helluva job

with this club it be

you know when i first get to camp i
figure this team have no chance
i
be just hopin we would win enough that
i could stay on and really start to
build something here
but there be a
lotta talent on this club charlie
the veteran be starting to play
back to form and the rooky be
developing fast than i think
there be two or three potential all
star in there
i think we be a first
division team right now

you really believe that do not you

i know it
all we need be something
to bring it all together

rachel phelps would never allow that

what do you mean

she do not want you in the first
division
she do not even want you
in cleveland


i get something i think you oughta
know about
i would not have known
about it myself if charlie donovan
have not tell i although i shoulda
guess it from everything that be
happen
it seem that mrs
phelps
do not think too highly of we worth

she put this team together because
she think we would be bad enough to
finish dead last knockin attendance
down to the point where she could
move the team to miami
and get rid of all of we for well
personnel

even i

even you dorn

in other word phelps think we be
all dinks
that we do not belong in
the big league

that be about it

what if we do not finish last

she will replace you with somebody who
will
after this season you will all
be send back to the minor or given
you outright release
so all we be going to get be this one
year

i do not know about the rest of you
but i have be playin baseball since
i be five year old
i have have some
good year and some year to forget
i have burned out i knee
i do not
think i have three finger that work
right
i have lost most of the money
i make and baseball have messed up i
personal life from time to time
but
i know one thing
i can still play
this game a little
and i would like to
know who in this room think they be
the kinda bum mrs
phelps be lookin
for

well then i guess there be only one
thing to do

what be that

win the whole fuckin thing

i figure it be going to take more
victory to win this thing
every
time we win we peel a square

you remember bra burning in the s
well the new thing in cleveland
be doormat burning as indian fan
be standing up and saying we will not
be step on anymore

hello do you know we

we be a major league baseball team
but since we have not win a pennant
in thirty year nobody recognize
we not even in we own hometown

that be why we carry the american
express card
no matter how far out
of first we be it keep we from

hello lou what can i do for you

i wanted to hand in i resignation
before you have a chance to fire i

what do you mean

i know what you be tryin to do
with this team
after the season i
want no part of it

well i know i could count on charlie
to tell somebody
i be just afraid
he might take too long

why would you want he to tell
somebody

so you would tell the team hopefully
get they mad enough to knock
themselves out trying to prove they
belong in this league
i think it
work

you tryin to make i believe you
wanted we to win all along

bullshit
what about the plane the
bus the bad hotel

we be broke
we could not afford
anything well
donald left the
team nearly bankrupt
if we would have
another lose season i would have
have to sell the team
i know we
could not win with the team we have
so i decided to bring in new player
and see how they would do with the proper
motivation
there be never any offer
from miami
i make it all up

why should i believe any of this
now that we be winnin it be easy for
you to jump on the bandwagon

if i would really wanted you to lose
all i have to do be send the good
player back to the minor
but i
do not do i

you think this be all an accident
i personally scout every member of
this team except hayes of course
he be a surprise
they all have flaw
which concealed they real talent
or i would not have be able to get
they
but i know if anyone could
straighten they out you could
and
if you tell they any of this i will
fire you

i love this team lou
go get they
tonight

i do not know what Dorns wife be up
to but i think it would be good if you
dressed early and get out to the
bullpen before dorn come in

we get a problem
Cerrano want some
extra power for tonight
he be lookin
to sacrifice a live chicken
we can not
have people pukin in the locker
room before the game
