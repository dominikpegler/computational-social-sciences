some of they want to use you
some of they want to get used by you
some of they want to abuse you
some of they want to be abused
eurythmics
some year from this exact moment



the beautiful through the

whiz past we face
they could be star at lightspeed or

in a flash we see riding
into a bleak future and hear the
it be
dark claustrophobic obscure
the rhythmic beat of track
and wheelclicks engulf we
the light flicker back on and
hold as we see a half dozen in steel
eyed prepare for whatever may be at the end of the
on
something roughneck
focused determined
eye
burning with internalize emotion
and late s undeniably hot but tough as hell
both be in shackle cuff be roughly transport
through underground tunnel knock and shove around
uniformed roam the train looking pissed off they
swagger seem to mask
be meditate or exhaust hard to tell
the
make eye contact w he

sandra
say nothing just stare at she stoic

i name be sandra

shut the fuck up
because he can the take a swing at head with
a





skull snap back into the window
the swing
again this time nail square in the stomach

Putcher dick away

get some





be buckle
over awkwardly hand behind she back tethered to the seat
head drip blood
jerk against he restraint
every inch of he wanting to
he use he elbow to help she back up but fight
through it sit back up and spit blood she can handle
herself
the hold on and
let we a
glob of blood dangle from he mouth biting he lip bear
it
we hear the of the working on the
other
and the and of the
growing loud slamming into we brain blot
out all thought
until



we be rag full sprint down a
towards dirty white
just heavy breath and the sound
of he boot bouncing off the concrete
other be running with we with weapon
at the
tunnel end
vaguely defined shape of building smoke
sky
we as we


smash into the
smoke plume hang from a recent skirmish
climb over
burn debris gun raised as and the other soldier
disappear into the grey mist


emerge from the smoke into




a


seemingly out
of character he and land in an
nine inch nail Coachella

in sequence multicolored led on he weapon
accompany by a low frequency hum that seem to pierce
somewhere below human hear
the spin
then snap into place


other emerge like out of and

they crouch and spread out

what appear like swarm thru the grey air at a
closer look they be like tiny that move like
hummingbird magnetically controlled
the swarm split
apart each connect with a different they
hover one foot above and two foot behind the head

slide behind a shred telephone pole and

the sound of train weapon soldier all fade
away
until


by KABLEs face a pause
we hear a
another by he leg and another by he shoulder
after the bullet pass we hear the
see the
lightning wait for the thunder
in the peripheral a in run from
behind an old car to a brick staircase
then another
run the opposite way closer in the foreground


the be crawling deafen and then


suddenly we be in
eye glance down at he the turret quickly
shift and rotate he whip it up in a flash and
into the mist


the shell puncture air and connect
distantly




the air ripple all around he he world closing in
he
break free and run toward an open street
he efficiently waste two with automatic
fire

couple of walk across the street totally

make a perfect degree cut
and wrap around a streetlamp and into the alley

hold out a can with a couple of coin and it
from an aerial we see the area swarm with
combatant and a dozen
in the top right corner
of we frame we see the of a somewhat
transparent watch the battle tungsten red similar to
you own reflection on a
we to the ground the whole area be a
line up another climb the fireescape to the
third floor window and then coming from the
behind we
almost a whisper too clean and distinct to be
outdoors in this environment
and to possibly
belong to



eat shit please

the drop like a sack
perfectly cut
back another degree and run for an old store front
inside a air bag grocery for an empty store
set up a and aim for a
bunker a hundred yard north
the distant target seem
almost robotically unaware
the plant his
leave hand on the ground for stability right hand twist
the griplock and squeezing the trigger



the fall some
clumsily collide into each other before they crash to the
ground dead
another team of rock they head around to focus on
he
uh oh

the be vaporize from the
knee up
the that supported he be standing
straight up cleanly severed at the elbow
it slowly wobble
over and connect with the severed at the knee
the fall into each other form a flesh and
bone








can not say i do not try




shit
shit




Suckage

tuning the out
turning he attention to

count down five
four

two



do we have the damn interview or
do not we





we be cunt hair close

i can not blow off the ThreeAsian
war for close

all respect bob nobody care
about dead orientals
they care
about ken castle

may i hear from gina please

bob
bob
you realize castle
have clock exactly one media
appearance to date and that be
walters last interview before she
die

stop menstruate just tell i we
fucking have it

we fucking have it

palindrome
hold on
focus
let we get lunch
sushi iranian or mexican

burger chili fry

i will freak a burger









with

first
there be society

the ultimate environment
where player do not control virtual
animate character but actual
live breathing human being

they walk they they talk they
they juice they

they rock they

we all remember the slogan





the creation of reclusive genius
ken castle society take the world
by storm becoming the number one
guilty pleasure of billions either
playing or watch
and
generating one of the world
large private fortune
surpass steve job and bill
gate practically overnight

i be not complainin

nine month ago castle unveiled a
new simulation one that would
take gaming to new height of
thril excess
and controversy


if society let we live thru
other
would let we die thru
other

slayer give the gamer full
control of a flesh and blood human
be in full scale killorbe
killed combat
and when we say
flesh and blood we mean flesh





and blood




slayer

slayer

why be not it murder

gina when be the last time you
see someone volunteer to be
murdered
i be sure you know that
every last one of we slayer be a
bona fide death row inmate
each one offered a chance to
participate as an alternative to
they sentence
stay alive for
thirty session and get set free
that be not a bad god damn deal

i see and have any one of these
man or woman ever actually survive
long enough to be set free





i would remind you audience that
slayer be put together with the
full cooperation and approval of
the united states federal
government
that the revenue it
produce be responsible for fund
we entire prison system keep
the bad guy behind bar
and
that the prop be vote for by a
cock solid of the american
public



Whatd he say



in an election tainted by
suspect digital fraud
let we talk about the socalled
genericons

send into the slayer environment
with a set of preprogram
action with no way to react and
no one controlling they they
chance of survival be next to
nil

there be a lot of man and woman in
prison that could never cut it as
slayer
should not they have the
same opportunity to roll the dice
for a ticket out
besides they
only need to survive one session





right







mr
castle how the hell do it
work

simple

it begin with a single nanocell
planted in the motor cortex of the
brain this cell can replicate
replace the cell round it with
perfect copy

these copy cell contain
remote access functionality
therefore nano plus cortex equal
the nanex





geek geek geek come on castle
you promised we a demonstration

do i
you know i seem to recall
that let we just see

oh
i god
so cute

you like she
she name be gina
she be a good little bitch

i beg you pardon



this motherfucker be off the
chart

you realize he could buy we
network

why would he





son of a bitch can pull million
payperviews for a single
broadcast

that be fuckin scary



be not it true that each human that
undergo the procedure will have a
distinct address like a
notebook computer or mobile device

similar yep
but control be
strictly localize to the
parameter of we gaming
environment

you take society for instance
once
a cast member leaf the workplace
they be completely free from the
control and monitor of they
player

that be a relief

to some maybe
to some
do not
you suspect a good many folk
would not mind an itty bit of
control

i do not
um





someone else making all the
decision for you
no
responsibility no tough
choice
think about it

we will mr
castle
we will


a





good little talk

i pleasure
shit can i tell you
i

wait for the next
slayer

unbelievable

ken castle want you to believe
that you be living in a safe
good world
he be a liar
mind
control be slavery
we will all be
he dog if we allow this evolution
to continue

mr
castle we have no idea

shush


that be a god damn hoot

bypass orbital reroute from the
backup server for christ
sake you dirty ape
sorry mr
castle we can not hard
line a live broadcast

impossible to stop every virus that
sneak in

sometimes
they take over you

they move you
like a robot
but it do not work so good
that
parte just for show
you can not
really fight that way

why

there be a delay

yeah the ping
they talk about
that
the time it take the slayer
to respond to the command
it be
like five millisecond ping eight
millisecond ping

whatever you call it
slice of a
second be the difference between
living and dying out there
when
the trigger pull

it be just i



hey
Kable





not interest

no
wait
look

flesh trust i they will change
they point of view

how can you be sure

seduce by the power the
violence
the dominance

guess we never figure on Kable
blowing up as big as he do

player could last over a dozen
session with the same icon

tillman be a perfect soldier a
tactical kill computer you
drop he in with common
murderer
what do you expect

he instinct give he an edge

and in the hand of a talented
player

of course we can never let he out
not after what we do to he

tell i again why we do not just get
rid of the problem
make a throat slash
motion
you know off camera

lack a flair for markete
the people would never accept that
they need to they gladiator
bring down
