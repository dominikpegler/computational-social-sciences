budapest skyline looking towards the parliament build
from here the world look serene peaceful
then as we
begin to we hear a faint whine increasing in
volume until it be the roar of two mig jet fighter
cutting across the skyline
the reveal a
watch the jet exclaiming excitedly in hungarian


down a bustle street as the jet
scream by overhead
pedestrian look up
all except one man
who continue walking
this be

more pedestrian
we be not sure who
we be suppose to be looking at the short stocky man
the
girl in the mini skirt
the man in the check jacket
car driving beside prideaux accelerate out of the frame
across the street the girl in the miniskirt peel off into
a shop
the stocky man turn and wave to we
but it be not
prideaux he be greeting but another passerby who walk
over shake hand
now we be left with prideaux and the magyar in the check
shirt neither paying any attention to each other
just as we be wonder if there be any connection the
two reach a corner and the magyar pause to cross the
road collide with another passerby
he look over and
see prideaux have catch the moment of slight clumsiness
and give the small of rueful smile
tiny moment of
contact between the two
then both man walk on around the
corner just two stranger headed in the same direction


shoot up the step of the exit to the impose
building on the corner ahead
prideaux and the magyar walk
up the step still paying no attention to each other and
head towards


formerly grand arcade
many of the shop be now closed
the one that be open do not have much to sell

occupy the middle space under the high vault ceiling

band rehearse in one of the nearby disused
shop incongruous in the window music muffled by the
glass
customer sit around table playing chess drink
coffee a mother breastfeeding the hum of chatter
the
ordinary world

we find prideaux and the magyar sitting at one of the
table

and porkolts
you know porkolts

yes i have have it

it be very good
well than
goulash
but you will not get it in
budapest now

why be that

all the pig have go to moscow
he give a sly laugh
prideaux smile draw on his
cigarette nonchalantly examining the people at the table
around they
arrive belly bulge out of he
grubby shirt hair plastered to he head
he put two
wizenedlooking sandwich in front of they



trickle from the
waiter face drip onto the table top
the magyar catch jim looking at the droplet and give a
wry smile nice service
jim smile back but a bell have
begin to ring inside he

when do i get to meet you
friend
the magyar chew on he sandwich notice prideaux be
ignore he

i will take you to he
not eating
prideaux push he sandwich across the table he manner
still easy but he eye flick after the waiter who stand
at the entrance to the coffee shop argue with another
man
he look around the galeria again looking low
checking the foot of the other customer
then raising he
gaze he check the window of the apartment above which
look down into the arcade



an stand in the shadow by a
window above
she be watch he
catching he gaze she
shrink back into the darkness and disappear

Prideauxs expression do not change but he set he coffee
cup down and casually stand
the magyar look up in
surprise

would you excuse i a moment
he start to walk towards the exit of the galeria
behind
he he chair teeter for a moment then slowly fall back
and land with a sending pigeon fluttering up to
the dome ceiling
the start turn see prideaux leaving
panic
flash across he face he draw a from the back of
he belt aim after prideaux and the shot echoing
in the cavernous space
the shot miss off the tile wall and
prideaux keep walking fighting down the impulse to run
as behind he out of focus an image from a surreal

the other stop what they be do
like actor at the end of a scene and begin to rise some
draw gun
we hear a muffle voice shouting distantly in
russian

no fire
ahead of prideaux more figure appear block the exit
he look over he shoulder just as another ring out
this one catching he above the shoulder blade and sending
he flying out of frame
from around a corner a tall overcoat man
stride towards the scene still bellowing in russian

who told you to fire
who told
you to fuck fire
have stopped playing and be stare at the
ground arm at they side anxious not to see anything
in the the slip back into sight



prideaux lie face down in the arcade below
as we watch one of he arm slide out leaving a slick of
blood
then he be still
the man have grab the waiter and start to
beat he

fucking hungarian amateur
we
wanted he alive










as he examine the other gauge the
occurring in the room
bill haydon handsome urbane frown with tension
pull on he cigarette
look up at smiley and away
Alleline watch for a cue like a dog told to stay
noone will look at he
realise there be no hope
control finish put the pen back in he pocket
he hand
the file to the who redeyed walk with it out of
the room

i wish i could have do more
control

you do all you could percy
well a man should know
when to leave the party
beat
the clock suddenly give a discordant chime as it
sound the hour
hint of bitter amusement on control
face as though he be be waiting for this wrong little
note to make he move
he grind he cigarette out
toby can not wait any longer

what about smiley
control look at smiley

prepare himself for the shock of dismissal

what exactly do irina say


she said there be a general
workname polyakov who be
station in london

Polyakovs real job be to

lacon and smiley be meeting with the

this meet be not taking place
be that clear

perfectly minister
there

city where Alleline and the
other meet Witchcrafts london
representative
i need the
address of that house

i do not know what you be talking
about
smiley stare at he

i think
lacon have make it clear to you

follow
you told i
to follow in control footstep

mess control left we with
it be
taken Alleline and if i may
say so myself this long to get
we back into the race

i be glad you take some of the
credit
lacon glance sharply at smiley there be something
different about he he tone

the man Alleline and the other
meet be called polyakov
you
believe he role be to bring
information from witchcraft to
you
he real role be to receive
information from the mole to take
back to karla
he have the minister full attention now
long silence

that be
that be not possible

make possible
by you
when he
steal we secret he do it
under the very nose of the
circus in the house which you
persuade the treasury to pay
for
i be sure you will be able to
take full credit for that

Witchcrafts intelligence be
genuine
it be be gold

just enough glitter amongst the
chickenfeed
control do not
believe in miracle and he do not
believe in witchcraft
but you
be lazy and you be greedy and
so you hound he out of the
circus and you let karla in
he voice be still calm but it be clear what be different
now
there be a quiet fury in he
the minister be ashen


oh god

look like fuck fool again
forget europe if we have the
black man get to hear about
this on WallaWallah news

if we find the mole and we move
he sideways some department
where he can not do any harm
be
the kremlin likely to boast about
this

not in they interest sir
they
need the enemy to look like a
threat

well tell they to play the game
we do not go crow about they
fuckups
in they panic both man be address each other
momentarily forget smiley

we be not the prize
we be the
bait
they turn to he

you have open negotiation to
exchange intelligence with the
american
what they tell the
circus they will be telling the
kremlin
Witchcrafts
information the gold karla let
you have
it be not to lure you
it be to lure the american
now do you want to take credit
for that
lacon and the minister stare at smiley

what can we do
