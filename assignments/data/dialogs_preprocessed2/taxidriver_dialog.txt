premium high resale gun

that be only a hundred over list

i could sell this gun in harlem for
today but i just deal high
quality goods to high quality
people
now this may be a little big for
practical use in which case i would
recommend the
smith and wesson
special
fine solid gun nickel
plate
Snubnosed otherwise the
same as the service revolver
now
that stop anything that move
and it be handy flexible


the magnum you know that be only
if you want to splatter it against
the wall
the movie have driven up
the price of the magnum anyway
everybody want they now
but the
wesson
only and worth
every dime of it
he hefts the

throw in a holster for

some of these gun be like toy
but a smith and wesson man you
can hit somebody over the head with
it and it will still come back dead
on
nothing beat quality
you interested in an automatic

i want a

revolver
and a
palm gun
that
there

that be the colt
a fine little
gun
do not do a lot of damage but
it be as fast as the devil
handy
little gun you can carry it almost
anywhere
i will throw it in for
another

how much for everything

the
s and you be really
get a good deal now and all
together it come to ah seven
eightyfive for four piece and a
holster
he will i will give you the
holster we will make it seventyfive
and you have get a deal a good one

how much to get a permit to carry


well you be talking big money now
i would say at least five grand maybe
more and it would take a while to
check it out
the way thing be
going now
be probably low
you see i try not to fool with the
smalltime crap
too risky too
little bread
say gs but if i
get the permit it will be as solid as
the empire state build
