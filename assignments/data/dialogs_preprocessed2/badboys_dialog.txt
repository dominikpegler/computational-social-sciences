and the woman really go for that
really they do



nice of you to roll in
and
nothing particular be going on
around here except maybe you
dope be go
that be right
the
big dope bust in the history
of this department up and walk
out of this locker along with
maybe i job and the two of yours
if we do not get the shit back

this can not be happening



so here what we be going to do
since it be originally you
case you two guy be on point
sanchez and ruiz you back they
up with whatever they need

so i guess we should start with
the
i
s and the perps from the
original case
but hell if i
know any dope dealer with the
ball to pull this off
they be
either dead or in the lockup
pending trial

how be OFee



oh he will be just fine

name sinclair
internal
affair
he be we new proctologist

you see what be get i confuse
be why risk leaving a witness
why not kill OFee instead

because maybe this guy know if
you kill a cop the whole
department get up he ass
hard and fast

and who know that good than
anybody else
cop

you be not sayin this be an
inside job
cop would not pull
this shit



not just cop
narcotic cop
for example the


you have
get access
you have get
wherewithall
and most
importantly you have get the
connection
who else would know
how to unload a hundred million
dollar worth of heroin

hey fuck you and you cheap off
therack suit

if
any of this leak the shit
going to hit we big fan

the mayor
he
created we and you can bet you
job boy he will rip we into
little cop piece
i figure we
get seventytwo hour to find the
dope and keep we job

nothing like a little oldfashion
incentive

what about the air conditioning

so what about it

what do you think

i think you should go ahead
crawl up and give it a good
look

why i
