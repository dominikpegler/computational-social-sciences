in the almost
forty year since we be tow out here
in hypersleep the news that come with
occasional supply ship only get bad

you waiting for meat
they do not bring
i meat because they know i be an android
really do not need it
bread well
for you anyway
harder to digest so
it make you feel full than you be

not hungry

mmmm
just a little crunchy

waste of time

you do not eat you will starve to death
girl

that be the plan when they put i down
here
and why should you care

because i be a synthetic person you do not
think i can care

believe i that be a discussion you do not
want to have with i

you told i you have a bad experience and
a good one with android

that be one of each
that mean you could
go either way
i be tire of talking about
this

you have still get to eat
you get to fight
the bastard

i be tire of fight
maybe i will be
dead before he find i
maybe he will not
get the satisfaction

he
you make it sound like this alien
have a personal score to settle with you
the biology you describe
queen lay
egg larva drone that be very
insectoid
insect usually do not bear
grudge

and android usually be not the prisoner
of lunatic that believe they be ancient
greek

medieval monk

whatever

and they have only choose to live the life
style they do not believe they be
what be that

ripley

hey you knocking cut it out
you be going to wake everybody up

brother john

anthony
think you dead fifteen year

make too good for that
what be
you do

i i be looking the abbot

what
you look like you have see the
devil

he have

you mean he

i be right be not i
you have see it
you have see the alien

i can tell you have
i be right
it come with i
go away

listen priest or whatever you be i
know what you want
i can not help you
i could not help any of the other
just stop what you be do
go away
do you understand

you going to stay father
but you be
not going to talk
okay
then you can
listen
you should listen
you abbot
be right
i be guilty
but not of
heresy
of murder

the murder of the crew of the nostromo
that be when i first meet the alien

no not the same one that be here now
or maybe it be
maybe they be all the
same one
i could not save i crew then
i should have be able to
but i could not
when i go the second time

then i meet newt
newt
i fight
stay alive to keep newt alive
hope maybe that would make up for

now he get she too
what be the point
just go away
leave i in here
if you
let i out you will want i to help you
and it will start all over again
let it end

i can not help you

Puh
please

it never end

sheep

it must be able to take on some of the
characteristic of the animal it grow in
maybe they be from some sort of aggressive
soldier race warring party drop the
egg on oppose planet

and the alien take on the form of the
creature that find it assuming that
animal be the dominant life form on the
planet
so when it gestates in a man

it be a biped
in a sheep or cow a quadroped

shit
i just do not think it could do that
to animal

wait a minute i think you be the
expert on this monster

be that the only reason you come to get
i out
because i know about this thing

yes
i mean no
i mean that be part of
it
look
i never think you be wrong
i be wrong not to say anything
i be
afraid to speak up
it be hard to be a
monk you know

thank you
if anything you be honest

we all be
take vow

i do not know about the abbot

i be sure he think what he do be right

be that speaking up for someone

no
charity

all right let we forget about the past
and get on to we survival
no more
prisoner behind we

not for year

okay if the alien have a few day
to lay he egg we only hope be to get
off this what be this

Arceon

satellite

get to i ship and get off this satellite

we can not

we can not what

leave Arceon
can not leave the library

tape library

book

so

the reason we be out here
like the
monk who guard monastery library
on remote island off england during
the first plague

there must be book on other colony

some of these book survive the burn
of the library of alexandria
they
contain knowledge that exist in no
other record
they value be unestimable

we be suppose to protect they

and what do an android have to do
with all this

he be a spy

the company planted i here

the company
what do the company have
to do with this

they build this prison

prison

colony

prison
they be all political heretic

you left that part out

the order be more of a counter culture
a reaction to the technology that be
beginning to take over everyone life
it be a simple enough idea read do not
watch disk
walk do not pump more carbon
into the air
the early member
renounce technology
start to collect
the remain book
nobody would have
notice if it have not be for the virus

you abbot talk about that
the
new plague

computer virus
bad program
by
this time the corporate structure be
transglobal all the world data storage
system be linked
it spread through
two country before it be stopped

after a scare like that thousands flock
to we retreat
people start clamore
for written information
for we book
they abandoned the modern way

i think i can see how this come out
they give up they possession

this be a threat

to the company

they sold the technology
movement
to live simply be quickly twisted by
federal agent into a political movement
against the Companycontrolled world
government
too much be at stake

too much profit

we be sentence as political dissident
this orbiter be we gulag
all the man
be packed up with all we book and
tow into space
ten thousand man
the
eldest die very quickly

the company have such a sense of irony
sending you out on this wooden tub

i be place among they as a sensor
keep tab on the movement

so how do they find out about you

i told they
after the supply ship
stopped coming i see no point in keeping
up the charade
since i be a sort of
walking reminder of technology they cast
i down

join the club
i figure this be not planned
you do not
have to be a genius to see it would not be
prudent to try to preserve mane written
works for generation without woman

and i do not know about you new plague
but i be just on earth and everything
fine

i be right about the alien be not i
mean i must be right about the earth

perhaps

that be good than nothing
come on

at any rate let we forget about the
earth completely whether you be right
or i be right what be important be get
the hell out of here
from here i ship
be

in heaven

right
and this be

this orbiter be pattern after a
medieval concept of the universe
they call the top half heaven

the abbey the field

the bottom half be hell
where we be

aptly named
what be in the middle

the sea

really

work with i here
how far be it back
to the surface of the planet

as a stone fall five mile through
the center

and the elevator the thing they
lowered i down in

rope cut

it be smart
first he cut they escape
off then work he way down through the
monastery level by level until there
be not a thing left alive
interesting

well you start appreciate he more
than i and i will find a way to shut
you down capisce andy
how do we
get up

there be ladder

five mile with the alien between we
and there
good luck boy

you can not

can not what
not help you go to you
death
i have have i fill of that

i need you
i can not do it alone

i have fight these creature twice
before
it take a lot to kill
these thing
heavy artillery

we do not have weapon here

how about something we can make weapon
from
do you have anything like that
any modern thing here

we renounce technology
it be those
thing that cause the plague

this be a manmade planet
something have
to be recirculate you air you water

god

please

i do not know
i just take it for grant

most people do
without some sort of
technology we have not get a chance

there be technology

room
technology room
fresh air
and water come out

an atmosphere processing plant

the heart and lung of Arceon

where be it

one level beneath the underground sea

that be five level up

on the other side of the orbiter

chance

all right
you have get i so far
but here the deal
i do not know
how many of you brother be going
to be alive when we get up there
but if we make it to i ship you be
all coming with i
we will take as
many of you precious book as we
can carry but we be going
i be not
going to fight this thing again to
end up alone again
understand

we be all dead anyway
we might as
well go fi

ugh i be all right

still thaw out
i hate hyper sleep
come on


stay together
together

run


no
the

it be not you fault you know

what

those thing you said before

i read about it in psychology book
sometimes when people outlive someone
they care for they transfer some of
the guilt for that persona death to
themselves

i get a belly full of that from the
Psychtechs when i be on earth
yeah
survivor guilt syndrome or something
like that
but that be not what i be
think about
i be think about
i friend up there

he be on the pod
he killed newt but
not i
why not i
it be almost like
he be playing with i
maybe they have
some sort of race memory
maybe he
know what i do to he mother

that be why he do not just kill i
that would be too easy
he have to
torment i

you make it sound human

hell i do not know what it be

i think i do

jesus christ
Ripleeeee

thanks

you be welcome

i be all right

hold this against you nose
it will
stop the flow

i be a doctor

no please
just let i sit
awhile

damn it

what be that

the reason i be down here

vision

dream

android can not dream

that be probably what they think when
they build i
but i brain be cyber
organic patterned after the human
brain it function the same way a
human brain do
it accumulate random
image and sensation during wake
hour but unlike the human brain that
slough they off during sleep

android do not sleep

right
maybe they have fixed this on later
model but i do not
do you know what
happen to the human brain when it be
deprived of sleep
it start to run off
the dream while you be awake as
hallucination
same thing with i
for twenty year i absorbed data on this
planetoid
little after we lost contact
with earth the vision start
they
think i be insane
i have to explain
that it be because i be an android
they liked that even less

what do you see

what i always see
image of monster
demon

they be portent
they stand for an
evil yet to come

just image i have absorbed from those old
book and have no way to get rid of

i see the inside of you cell

i head be full of they
i try to get
they out any way i can

you need sleep

i know that
i will settle for rest

stay with he

no
we all need rest
you especially

doctor order

besides you see what happen when you
get ahead of we
we should stay together

all right
he be still above we anyway

what do you mean

i have face this evil twice before i
guess i have get sensitive to it
you be really a doctor

see i bag

what be that book

just a book

i do not buy just a book from a guy who
say we can not leave the planet without
the library

it be just
a medical book i might need

you do not have any food in there do you

only if you can eat bandage

in a few hour that be going to sound
good
go in and out of suspend
animation christ i probably have not
eat in a year

you should have eat the bread

rest

you all right

ace

you be not hurt when i landed on you
bruise a rib

be you sure you be a doctor

sort of
i father passed on when we
first come here
the abbey physician
father anselm take i in
he really
raised i
teach i what he could before he
passed away
he be school on earth

well i be just hungry

you have not eat since i take you
out of you tube

you do that

you burned yourself on the escape pod

thank you i guess

you should have eat the bread

enough rest
there be beasty afoot

blood
mix with sea water

we be get close to the center of
the arc near the sea

blood

get close

the abbot

father

what be you do down here father
you look like you have see something
that do not exist

i be they spiritual leader
i be not
prepared to lead they in battle
not against that thing

no one could be

i think you said the evil be inside
i that seal i up be the answer
to all you problem

destruction
the destruction bring
to we

i only tried to warn you

what be you do with this woman

we be going to the technology room
trying to find some way to fight

you do not join the devil to fight the
devil

she be helping we

look who defend the deceiver the one
who be not even human
john can not you see
what be happening
on ancient earth
during the black death many believe
that god have abandoned they so they
appeal to the devil
flock to he
hope to save they body losing they
soul in the bargain

father we be all on the run from the
same monster so let we not resort to the
fire and brimstone routine
i have be
enlighten about you movement

pretty funny to be tried for heresy on a
planet of heretic

please

all right
i be trying to keep you quiet

sir

i do what i have to do to keep the
brotherhood together
we all give up
believe in earth a long time ago
how
do you think they would feel if tell
they exile be in vain
that the
holocaust they be trying to avoid
never occure
those man up there have
grow to live with it

and with you as they leader

you threatened the status quo

so you protector of knowledge and truth
lie to they

only about you
the rest i still
believe
if earth still orbit it sun
there be no way it could have survive
be reduced to barbarism

you be as bad as the company

ripley

that be why you run
after all you talk
death stare you in the face and you
be afraid

not afraid of death

the alien

the organism

the devil

what be that

man trap

in case anyone tried to get in and
tamper with the technology

what do we do

do not move
do not breath

we can not just stand here and wait

floor too unstable to try to walk
around they

john what be you do

he be think like a leader
everyone
grab wood
spring the trap
clear a path
good work father john

brother

brother
let we go

i just be you allright

tie
without sleep food i just
feel i age
figure hyperspace time i be almost a
hundred

hello

i think this be it

technology

yeah a hundred year ago
an antique

go ahead

go ahead and what

open the door woman

i will get to it but listen to i
you may dress like you be living in
the middle age but you can not treat
i like you chambermaid or whatever
monk have



what be wrong

shit

it be open

close it close it it be coming

we wait
john

hurry




no

i beat you
i beat you mother
fucker

i think we would lost you

what be you writing

last will and testament
just kidding

be he

resting
he will be fine

no i will not
he be a terrible liar

i be sorry

it be ironic
i guess i vision be
prescience after all
how will i ever
resolve that with i artifical con
science

do you see what you have deliver we
into

yeah
lead i not into temptation to
kick you ahh

oh shit

where be the big boy

on the other side of that door
wait for we to starve to death

it be playing with we
it could get in
here any time it want

why should he enter
he know that one
of the people in this room be in league
with he

sir
we be all in the same coracle so
to speak

maybe more than one of we

let we talk about the fact mr
abbot

this be you technology

even this be forbid to we

well then the fact be that we be screw

an eco system
nothing to recycle you
atmosphere except the green plant
wind
generated down here
windmill use the natural surface wind
to turn wheel underground create tide
on the sea to recirculate you water

more than that
there be pump beneath
the floor i can feel they vibration

probably pumping this air through charcoal
filter

it get cold all the time here right

yes

you wood burn fire throw soot into
the atmosphere building the cloud layer
cutting off the sun ray cool the
planet forcing you to burn more wood

the greenhouse effect
it be how the earth
almost destroyed itself in the late th
century

do not you see
this be a planet set to
self destruct
not in ten minute or two
hour but soon
you atmosphere here be
finite
if the plant die the fire will
eat up all the oxygen this planetoid
will be dead everyone will die

it be here
i be just hope i would be
dead long before it come to this

what

we be suppose to die here
that be the point

wait a minute you be exile

the punishment for we crime be death

this planet be the supreme triumph of
plan obsolesence
certain amount of
primitive material with an atmosphere
processing system as fragile as a real
environment but not replenishable

poetic justice for the antitechnologists
the company good work
you know i used
to be a corporate executive
middle range


then i wife get hit by a speed craft
i chuck it all and joined the order
be a monk see the world
be here
be chairman of the board

no now i understand why i landed here
to join you happy lunatic in you
death

ripley wait

where can she go
she be trapped
trap inside she own prison
prison
in she mind
inside she mind

foryouuuuuuuuu


it come out of he fuck
head

i do not have to see that to know what
that means

he send he to we
that bastard outside
i can not get away from he
he be fuck
with i mind
he be i punishment

i be confuse
before you said it come out
of the torso not the head

i do not feel like a discussion of alien biology

ripley do not

i should just wait for the air to run out

i believe i know that we can win
there be an answer in we book

you book
you book be go brother
you world be go
once that thing start
to lay it egg all you brother if
they be not already be dead

if that be true then all of we the book
be consign to ash

ripley

what

there be several inconsistancies between
this and the other alien you described

give it up

i think this be important
this may help
we fight it
the creature that i fight
in the hall when i first see it it have
camoflaged itself to look like wood

wood
when i see it in i room it look
the way it do before black mechanical
unless that be a dream

i do not think it be
i think that this
creature if it be the efficient predator
that you say it be have the ability to
adapt to it environment

then the reason they have always look the
same to i be that i only ever see they in
the same environment

or this may be an as yet unseen stage of
development you see a queen this
could be like a king ant more highly
advance than the drone breed for
survival

how do this explain the thing that come
out of the ewe chest
the abbot head

maybe it can deposit different type of
egg
the chest burster be probably
dormant until the host eat the first
one i ever see come out of kane after he
start to eat

no

no what

no we be not beat yet father

brother

brother
not yet
if he be taunt i
then maybe we can use that
we can beat
this bastard
we can get to i ship
we can live


do not have second thought
blind and
cripple i would only slow you down
give he time to figure out what you be
do
just leave i i staff

okay
good luck

ripley i know
good luck

sit tight

he could be waiting on the other side
of that door
we might not get ten foot
before he kill the three of we

we have well go then

must be day on the surface of the planet

where be the light coming from

mirror
reflect the outside light down
great shaft through lense
that be
what they make in the glass factory
lense
look

open to the surface
water flow in
and out
i do not know how
there be one
at either end
i come down on the other
side
