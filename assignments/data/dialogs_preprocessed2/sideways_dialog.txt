Non

fiction
although
there be a lot from i own life so i
guess technically some of it be non
fiction


good i like nonfiction
there be
so much to know about the world that
i think reading a story someone just
invent be kind of a waste of time

so which one do you like good

i like they both but if pressed i would
have to say i prefer the dark

see

where the fuck be you man

interest at conundrum

passing it up to a senior editor
she be suppose to hear something
this week but now it be next week
and

i have
be through it too many time
already

i do not know
senior editor
sound
like you be in to i

it be a long shot all right
and
conundrum be just a small specialty
press anyway
i be not get i
hope up
i have stopped caring
that be
it
i have stopped caring

but i know it be going to happen this
time

up in the wine country
they will think
you be a moron

just tell i

color in the red wine come from
the skin
this juice be free run
so there be no skin contact in the
fermentation ergo no color

sure be tasty

do you read the late draft by
the way

oh yeah

and

i liked it a lot

improvement

look how beautiful this view be
what a day

generally like the way they manipulate
chardonnay in california too much
oak and secondary malolactic
fermentation

jesus what a day
be not it gorgeous
and the ocean just right over that
ridge
see the reason this region
great for pinot be that the cold air
off the pacific flow in at night
through these transverse valley and
cool down the berry
Pinots a
very thinskinned grape and do not
like heat or humidity

jack chris
chris jack

how you do

you guy want to start with the vin
gris

sound good

this be rise right

good yeah it be a rose
only this
one be rather atypically make from
pinot noir

pinot noir
not again
you know not all Pinots be noir

let i show you

first take you glass and examine
the wine against the light
you be
looking at color and clarity

what color be it suppose to be

depend on the varietal
just get a
sense of it
thick
thin
watery
syrupy
inky
amber whatever

huh

now tip it
what you be do here
be checking for color density as it
thin toward the rim
tell you how
old it be among other thing usually
more important with red
this be a
very young wine so it be going to
retain it color pretty solidly
now
stick you nose in it

do not be shy
get you nose in there

what do you smell

i do not know
wine
fermented grape

there be not much there yet but you
can still find
a little citrus
maybe some
strawberry
passion fruit
and
there be even a hint of like
asparagus
or like a nutty edam
cheese

huh
maybe a little strawberry
yeah
strawberry
i be not so sure about
the cheese

now set you glass down and get some
air into it

oxygenating it open it up unlock
the aroma and the flavor
very
important
now we smell again

that be what you do with every one

when do we get to drink it

now

how would you rate this one

usually they start you on the wine
with learning disability but this
one pretty damn good
this be the new one right chris

release it about two month ago

nice job

we like it

you know you could work in a wine
store

yeah that would be a good move

be you chewing gum

want some



hey jack hurry up



just a minute

i think you said it be close
now
i be all pitted out

we should have driven

not with the wine list these people
have
we do not want to hold back

you think i be making a mistake
marry christine

whoa

come on do you think i be do the
right thing
tell the truth
you have
be through it

well you wait for good reason
and you proposed to christine for
some good reason
so i think it be
great

look at i
i think victoria and i
be set for life

Christines dad he be be talking
about bringing i into he property
business
show i the rope
and
that be something consider how
long it take he to get over i be not
armenian
so i be think about it
but i do not know might get a little
incestuous
but mike do pretty
well
lot of highend commercial
stuff

so you be going to stop acting

no way
this would just provide some
stability be what i be saying
i can
always squeeze in an audition or a
commercial here and there you know
keep myself in the game in case
something big come along

Uhhuh

we be not get any young right
and i career well it be get
pretty you know frustrate
even
with i new manager

year ago

what be the bottle that do it

Eightyeight Sassicaia

wow

this be tasty
really good
how about

yeah i would say you be right on the
money

i divorce no kid

yeah same here

let we go in there

look like we friend be hitting
it off

it be kind of weird sit here with
you in Stephanies house
all those
time you come into the restaurant
it be like you be a real person now
almost

yeah i know
it be kind of weird
out of context

yeah weird
but great

yeah
definitely

so what be you novel about

well it be a little difficult to
summarize
it begin as a firstperson
account of a guy taking care of he
father after a stroke
kind of base
on personal experience but only
loosely

what be the title

the day after yesterday


oh
you mean
today

um
yeah but it be more

so be it kind of about death and
mortality or

Mrnmm yeah
but not really
it
shift around a lot
like you also
start to see everything from the
point of view of the father
and
some other stuff happen some
parallel narrative and then it
evolve or devolve into a
kind of a RobbeGrillet mystery
you know with no real resolution

wow
anyway i think it be amazing
you be get it publish
really
i know how hard it be
just to write
it even

yeah
thanks

like i i have this stupid paper
due on friday and as usual i be
freak out about it
just like in
high school
it never change

paper

yeah
i be working on a master in
horticulture
chipping away at it

horticulture
wow
i do not know
there be a college here

i commute to san luis Obispo twice a
week

so
you want to work for a winery
or something someday

well

i do have a copy of the manuscript
in the car
it be not fully proof
but if you be okay with a few typo

oh yeah
who care
i be the queen of
typo
wow this be really starting to open
up
what do you think

i palate kind of shot but from
what i can tell i would dub it pretty
damn good

can i ask you a personal question

sure

why be you so into pinot
it be like
a thing with you

i do not know
it be a hard grape to
grow
as you know
it be thinskinned
temperamental ripen early
it be
not a survivor like cabernet that
can grow anywhere and thrive even
when neglected
pinot need constant
care and attention and in fact can
only grow in specific little tuck
away corner of the world
and only
the most patient and nurturing grower
can do it really can tap into Pinots
most fragile delicate quality
only when someone have taken the time
to truly understand it potential
can pinot be coax into it full
expression
and when that happen
it flavor be the most haunt
and brilliant and subtle and thril
and ancient on the planet

i mean Cabernets can be powerful
and exalt but they seem prosaic
to i for some reason
by comparison
how about you

what about i

i do not know
why be you into wine

i suppose i get really into wine
originally through i exhusband
he
have a big kind of showoff cellar
but then i find out that i have a
really sharp palate and the more i
drink the more i liked what it make
i think about

yeah
like what

like what a fraud he be

no but i do like to think about the
life of wine how it be a live thing
i like to think about what be going
on the year the grape be grow
how the sun be shining that summer
or if it rain
what the weather
be like
i think about all those
people who tend and picked the
grape and if it be an old wine how
many of they must be dead by now
i
love how wine continue to evolve
how every time i open a bottle it be
going to taste different than if i
have open it on any other day
because a bottle of wine be actually
alive it be constantly evolve
and gain complexity
that be
until it peak like you
and begin it steady inevitable
decline
and it taste so fuck
good

bathroom over there

yeah

you be such a loser
come on

i be just get some water
you
want some water

nice
