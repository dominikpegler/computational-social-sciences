nobody hang a picture of an oil
tanker
that be the header

there be a photo hung in the
library
eight schooner heading
out to fish ground sail spread
it like white wing
beautiful
beyond
compare

more common today be the low black
profile of oil tanker
like the
ruptured golden goose which last
week bleed ton of crude onto
seabird fish and boat at cape
despond

there will be more and more tanker
they will grow old and corrode and
they tank will split
they have
already do to fish
what they
spill have do to fish

nobody hang a picture of an oil
tanker
on they wall

well
whatcha think

i think when card see it he will
split a gut
i think he will sit up
night think of cheap shot to pay
you back
i think he will never stop
until you be fired

i think i have not be so proud
of
a friend
since i do not know when

maybe another sandwich
there be
roast pork

well sure

oh i will run it
just easy
copy edit
when yer can move
piece around

run it
like i write it

how do this suit you Quoyle
i will do i job
you do yer which
mean a fourvehicle pileup south
a KillickClaw
and do not ferget
the camera

i fergot something

you pinko Greepeace sack a quivering
pigfat

like i said
nobody hang those

you column front page stuff
only
now it be more like a caption be all

more than tanker proudly ride
the world sea
even the big
take advantage of Newfoundlands deep
water port and refinery

spell everthin perfect
so as not
embarrass yer

oil and newfoundland go together like
ham and egg and like ham and egg
they will nourish we in the come
year

even put you name on it

let we all hang a picture of an oil
tanker
on we wall

man a you principle
i unnerstan
resignation be only honorable
course

how can a man resign
to nobody

if yer off to see jack Buggit
you hafta swim some

yer can whine an beg he
but i
run he paper every inch of it
every dirty timeeatin job which he
would have do without i

an if yer think he be going to choose
you over fishin
yer not as smart as
even you look

i an jack
have a symbiotic
relationship
yer can look that up

i know the word card
it mean
you two deserve each other

i will

so
this be what jack and i think

we want to run Quoyles oil spill
piece because controversy sell
paper and paper sell ad

sound reasonable to i

and we be going to let Quoyle have
he head on these column up to
word
so he will get his
confidence up

well let we not go overboard
he be
rather green doncha thi

but we want to expand he responsi
bilities to boat crash
there be
maybe four a week

he will need a raise
and need to be
represent in the negotia

and
the oil tanker picture
stay

all that clear

one more thing

jack go fish

to you

when you going to ask

when you be in the mood

she musta do something

the way he talk
he could just
say eeee like that



she told he that recess be almost
over an she be not going to make a trip
special an he could hold it



she make he stand against the wall

see a good dad would say hitting

it be the engine of life

so when you told i how you think
about you husband

that be what i wanted we to talk
abou

because real love
just come
once

about petal
some of the bad thing
what you do not know

be how much you love she

even tho
she never loved you

sorta
because of it

see love
be not about what be good
for you
be not about what you wish
it be
be not about what
would
make you happy

love
be about want
what you
really want
and you can not change
that
even if it be poison

so that be why it be great
to have a
real friend
