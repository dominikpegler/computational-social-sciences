i
think it might be a nice gesture
if you ask she out





do not you think that she be a
terribly attractive girl
because i think she be one of
the pretty girl i have
ever see





it be pretty embarrass
i
really do not know what to tell
mr
robinson
it be ackward
and strained for i every time
he suggest that you call up
elaine

next time he suggest it
i will tell he i have no
intention of ever calling
she up in i life
