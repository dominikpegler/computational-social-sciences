if you

what would it take to buy we
stock back
name you price

to get i in a mood to sell
double what i paid
but you
company do not have enough
capital right now to buy anything

we be on the verge of close
a large navy contract
double
be ridiculous but we can assure
you a healthy profit on you
share
we would give you a
promissory note

you be not get any navy
contract

there be no way you could know
that

but i do know
i also know you
line of credit be overextend

to acquire it
either i buy from
the other stock holder or i buy

than fight a battle you do not have
the ammunition to win

slippery little sucker

you some question about you
company

dad excuse i but that be
inappropriate
you be under no
obligation to answer any question
at all

could we at least wait till after
the file period

mr
harris be preparing a bid
base on we speculation of the
corporation net worth
the
price he ultimately pay for you
father stock will be base on
that bid
the more we know the
high we bid can be

it be in i good interest to
cooperate david

if he throw himself on you
sword you promise to take care
of he and he family huh

that be unfair

you bed it be
you be everything he said you
be
do what you have to do dad
just do not expect i to watch it

he be young
he have not learned
how to lose gracefully yet
i will
sign you paper
and i will answer
you question
whatever you
want

stop
for just a moment
mr
kross i would like to ask you
a few question before you sign
you realize that you be a target
if you be not mine you would be
someone else correct

yes

if you have a
reprieve what
would do

i do not think there be any sense
in

let he answer

i
i would take advantage of
it

how

i
i do not know
there
there be not time

i suppose you would find out soon
enough that you have asset you
presently do not seem aware of
would not you
the waste
processing license at that
abandoned shipyard of yours you would
certainly find out about that

oh i god

collateral on new loan would not
you

have you lost you mind

quiet
would i get the loan

this time i imagine you would
yes
as if think about
it
hmm
with all this in mind mr
kross
i can not logically make a formal
bid on you company can i

you would be initiate a financial
battle you would ultimately lose mr
harris
