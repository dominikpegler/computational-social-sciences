oh
what be you real job

that would be stock boy at the shop
rite
but as president don kaminsky
say every employee be part owner
so you could say i be a captainof
industry in train
kind of
capitalist larva

that be quite an image

only if you see the most magical
part
do you see

what

one day i will be a beautiful butterfly
first i will have to be a pupa though
i figure i will not be going out much
then
pupa
the awkward adolescence
of the insect world

whatever it take to get you through
the day

i have the afternoon off
come away
with i

i be not at a good stop point

oh come on
they will still be here
i know you will still be here

i really should not

but everyone will be coming soon
and it will get all crazy and we
will not have any time to ourselves

we will
i promise

like tonight
we can practice
honeymoon suite

maybe
probably

be he always like that

like what

overbearing

just because he do not want to picture
you as a pupa

oh he will later
when he be alone
whether he want to or not

not that though
how he wanted you
to stop

he want to be with i
what be so
bad about that

just because some one want to be
with you do not mean they be good
for you

no one should ever ask you to stop
if you stop you might not be able
to start again
or you might start
again only thing will be different

well that be sweet

it be not sweet actually
it be just
the truth

hey i can take care of myself

when be the wedding

at the end of the month
but do not
ask i about it
it make i nervous

why
be something wrong

no

what be you paint

really there be so many layer of
imagistic symbolism that i really
do not feel comfortable summing it
up but well it be a recur
dream image

have not decided yet if she be get
scuba gear on or not

do you have any idea what you be
talking about

do that matter

well some people actually say what
they really think

what if they do not know what they
really think

it do not matter
it be called be
yourself

sound bore

not bore
scary and wonderful and
exciting

hey
i be trying to create here
stop
distracting i

mom get you working late

contained in it
each draw have a
whole life contained in it

after all mrs
bowland sometimes
when you bite the bullet it explode
in you mouth

why i have never think about it
before but that be a rather strange
expression be not it
you would not
say sooner or later you have get to
put the grenade in you pants would
you

but have you ever notice how in

before they throw it

answer i this
how come no one ever
reenacts the vietnam war

it would be pretty depressing would not

i guess it would

plus that you would have to have
protester and stuff

folk dressed up like you mom and
i
people reenact fleeing to
canada burn draft card

that would ruin the spirit of the
thing now would not it
