paleolithic

up
you be the only one i can trust


the board be talking about bringing
in sponsor
we be a die art
adam

phil

yeah

i should probably get to work

that be probably a good idea

i think i be going to go to lunch

greg
what be you do

it be a velociraptor

where do it come from

the dinosaur exhibit
why can not we just say it be the
first domesticate pet
people
love dinosaur


greg you can not just
that be a
million year old fossil
just
please put it away before someone
see it

coming up here on we left be the
origin of man exhibit on loan
from the smithsonian institute
it
will not be open to the public for a
few more month so you be one of
the first group to see it
adam

everyone this be adam he be the
curator of ancient civilization
here at the museum

hey kid

why do not you tell we what we be
looking at

this here be a family of homo
sapien who live in europe about
year ago


these cro Magnons as they be
often called be the close in
the evolutionary chain to modern
day human

what make cro Magnon so advanced
be they sense of community
they
be the first to settle on a
single plot of land devote to one
partner raise a family and take
care of the sick

this be lame
i think you said we
be going to see dinosaur

see i told you

who want to hear about the
caveman

caveman


this be homo Neanderthalensis the
neanderthal man
for over
year he ancestor dominated all
of europe
but then about
year ago neanderthals begin to
disappear until one day they
entire civilization be go


what happen

greg you know what happen

i do

come on
tell we what happen to
the caveman

well no one know for sure
but
it be suspect that because
neanderthal be a nomadic huntsman
he roam the land only fend
for himself never learning to
cohabitate with other
so as cro
Magnon family settled into
europe they take over the land
one by one neanderthal be push
out
and never see or hear from
again

that be quite a story
thank you
adam

you really know how to win a crowd

but you never know just because they
vanish do not mean they be go
for all we know there could be a
neanderthal walk among we right
now
and by the look of this guy

i would say he probably play defense
for the raider

this suck ass


i see dinosaur


patient have be complaining of
excessive urination back pain and
night sweat
blood test and urine
analysis be normal
indicate
a massive intraduaral extradural

neurofibrosarcomas extend into
psoas muscle with nerve root
compression syndrome and bone
erosion


growth extend from the to
cytotoxic antibiotic be
recommended


yes
question

i have no idea what you just said
be there something wrong with i



if you look here on you you
see this cephalopod like object
spreading down along you spinal
column


that be a massive schwannoma
neurofibrosarcomas

i still have no idea what you be
talking about


it be a malignant tumor

what
tumor
no


i be afraid so

how be that possible
i do not
smoke
i do not drink
i eat
healthy
i even recycle


well adam it be actually quite
fascinating
you cancer be the
result of an incredibly rare gene
mutation in chromosome p in the
p gene that cause the growth of
malignant cell in tissue around
the nerve
in you case it be grow
along the nerve in you low
spine

but look at i
i do not look sick


cancer often have no specific
symptom
people can go year with
out knowing they be sick
we be
lucky we caught it before it
metastasizes



i be going to put you on a month
regimen of chemotherapy
it be an
aggressive dosage so you might want
to think about taking some time off
from work

can not you just cut it out of i


yes that be an option
but because
the tumor have spread to a such
significant size
cutting it out
now would be risky

well what be i chance of beat
this

ross
listen you be in good hand
the
good thing for you to do right now
be to not worry
let i do the
worry
alright


maybe you should talk to someone


we have a whole department of
psychologist here in the hospital
they specialize in case
in
these
sort of matter
they will be
able to help you

but there be a reason
you choose to
use humor rather than express how
you really feel

in order to heal the body you must
heal the mind
it be imperative that
you free yourself from stress and
anger
get rid of all those
negative emotion stored deep
inside

so today what i want to do be start
you on some very simple relaxation

nonexistent void with i
grandparent be fun
i spent i
entire life trying to get away from

remove part of the hip and pelvis
as well as most of the psoas
muscle
we also have to remove a
good amount of sheath tissue around
the sciatic nerve the damage to
that nerve be considerable which
