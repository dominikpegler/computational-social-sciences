i have a little problem in chicago
something about trying to sell a
truckload of dope to an undercover
officer
so i applied the three rule
of the game under if and when arrested



rule one
do not fight
trial will
cost you a fortune in lawyer fee and
the jury will chop off you ball and
hand they to you on a platter

george jung you have be accuse of
possession of sixhundred and sixty
pound of marijuana with intent to
distribute
how do you plead



rule two
plead not guilty and get
bail out of jail

you honor i would like to say a few word
to the court

by all means

in all honesty i do not feel like what
i have do be a crime and i think it be
illogical and irresponsible for you to
sentence i to prison
none of the real
criminal of the world ever end up
behind bar
i mean when you think
about it what do i really do
cross
an imaginary line with a bunch of
plant
you say that i be an outlaw you
say that i be a thief but where be the
christmas dinner for the people on
relief

those be very interesting concept you
have mr
jung
unfortunately for you the imaginary
line you crossed be real the plant you
bring with you be illegal and what
you do constitute a crime

bail be set at twentythousand dollar

surprise

baby you do not have to come

what and miss all the fun
mon not
a chance
so what be the verdict

lawyer say he can plead it down to five
year
i will serve two

two year
george i can not wait that
long

what
you be not going to wait for i

george i go to the doctor
i do not
have two year



which bring i to rule number three
which say fuck rule one and two skip
bail and take off



time be such a funny thing
i look at
where i be now and in here time inch
along
so slow it hardly seem like it
move
but back then time go fast

sir please state you name

i be george jung
spell JyouNG

thank you

mr
jung do you know diego delgado

yes i do

do you see he here in the courtroom

yes he be sitting right there at the end
of the table

let the record state the witness have
identified diego delgado

mr
jung can you describe the
circumstance of how you begin talking
about cocaine with mr
delgado

shortly after i arrive at danbury
federal correctional institute i related
to diego that the crime i be in for be
smuggling marijuana
diego told i he have high level
connection in colombia and they needed
to find someone to help they transport
cocaine into america

the first run be fifteen kilo which
we smuggle into logan airport in hard
shell suitcase

we wrapped the cocaine in kitchen
cabinet paper and duct tape that way
if there be any dog in custom

i introduce diego to a pilot named jack
stevens who helped we fly kilo of
cocaine per week into the united states
via twinengine cessna
jack would fly
into north carolina we would meet he there
and drive it down to different
distribution point

i never meet pablo escobar
diego
delgado be i only connection to
cocaine from colombia

diego convinced i to keep most of i
money in a panamanian bank
diego have a
close relationship with manuel noriega
in exchange for allow we to keep we
money there we paid he a percentage

there be an chance that if you
snort cocaine between it
be ours
initially with i
connection we invent the
marketplace
in there be no
other real competition

the first year we make about million
dollar between we
it be an expensive
operation
eventually we build up to
three different pilot do multiple
run per week connection on both
coast everything be running smooth
we be like a corporation

he be very antigovernment
he talk
about revolution form he own
country or island he be looking for
power as well as money
i be just
looking for money

he disliked the united states think
it be a police state
he hope that by
flooding the country with cocaine it
would disrupt the political system and
tear down the morality of the country

well yes derek Foreal be i
connection i meet he back in when
i first moved to manhattan beach
it
be Foreals marijuana connection that
kick off we cocaine market

yes it be i idea to bring the kilo
to los angeles
when diego finally get
derek Foreals name from i it be only
a matter of month before he would cut i
out

i be not sure how i relationship with i
daughter and exwife have anything to do
with this trial
i mean we be here to
talk about diego delgado be not we

yes we be mr
jung

mr
jung you be a convict felon
correct

yes i be

do you have any agreement or
understand whatsoever with the united
states government in regards to you
testimony

no i cam here out of i own volition

excuse i

something about vengance be good
serve cold

really
be you get paid mr
jung

excuse i

mr
jung do not you have an agreement or
understanding with the united states
government in connection with you
testimony in this case

i be do sixty year at Otisville no
chance of parole
even if they cut i
sentence in half i will be seventythree
year old
that be some fuck deal
i
do not know if the parole board the
judge the pope or jesus christ himself
can get i out of here
i have a really
bad record i be not sure what be going to
happen
