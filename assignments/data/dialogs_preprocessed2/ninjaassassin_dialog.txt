raw and bloody the needle brush tap with the
precision of ritual
the tattoo be in the style of a Kuniyoshi print
miyamoto
Musashi thrusting he spear into the wrthe dragon
the image have beauty but retain the violence required to
saturate flesh with art
the skin canvas shift uncomfortably with the needle

nature of the man and illuminate
the four noble profession in the
book of five ring
the warrior
the artist the merchant and the
farmer

between the needle and the skin
between the mark and the man then
perhaps the path you have chosen

suited

there be many with he and they
laugh like you laugh now
then
it come from the shadow and they
laughter be drowned in blood
you cannot bargain with what be
coming
you cannot reason with it
because it be not a human being

hell that will never stop until

nd

tattoo of a Shinobi demon thrusting it blade into a lump
of scar tissue at the center of he heart

that night one of they blade

but for an accident of birth
i

he lieutenant laugh hard with he until the top of he
head disappear sliced off from he jaw up leaving he
tongue wagging in space
light shatter around the room
chaos ensue
the panick scream of the flee
entourage comingle in chorus with gruesome death rattle
of Hollywoods foot soldier as one by one they be
eviscerated
nd


there be a of movement more feel than see
the
whistle of sword through the air
cry and scream
gun that fire suddenly and be just as suddenly still
on the face of the tattoo master barely visible in
the thin trace of moonlight from a nearby window
freeze
immobile
as the kill continue around he
then
silence broken by the sound of heavy desperate
and a be strike by hollywood who
look up
and see a dark figure standing before he
everyone

only he and the tattoo master remain
the
figure regards he with still silence
for perhaps the
first time in he life hollywood be terrify

they answer be silence
hollywood see he gun nearby
with a desperate scream he the match in the air
as he for he gun grab one in each hand
there be a whistle of metal and suddenly he severed
hand be tumbling gracefully through the air
the blade swing again slice through he body as if it
be barely there coming out the other side as
Hollywoods body erupt as it fall in two piece
splatter the artist with blood
the match touch the floor and go out
the tattoo master do not move have not moved

but you be real be not you
after a moment the ninja emerge into the moonlight the
way a shadow coalesce into a panther gliding from the
dark to inspect it kill

he finally force himself to open he eye
the ninja be go have depart as silently as he
come leaving death and blood in he wake

candle as an old man hardedged and
unforgiving talk to he clan

good day
he close the door behind he


he stand on the other side of the door surveying the
room for a moment with severe unforgiving eye
the
place be monastic nothing decorative or comfortable
then in a quick series of cut he check all of the
secret place he hide thing
drawer be flip over and a hide bottom open
reveal weapon
panel in the oven reveal he chain
and blade
hide compartment in he suitcase expose
inky fold of fabric
he sift through they as we hear



you should have die


Raizo breathe hard stand over another young boy that
he have just defeated in a fight
both be sweaty dirty
scar
the other child be lined up in perfect
row watch silently
most be boy but a few be
girl
one of they be lithe and supple a
childes eye haunted by an adult sorrow and knowledge
Ozunu circle Raizo as he regards he fall opponent

on the street
abandon by you
parent
without a home
without
people to care for you
you
should have do as most child
do and go quietly from this
world to the next
but instead you fight
as you
do here today
you fight
and
you win
as we with Ozunu we see that Raizos body be
covered in scar

scar be the calligraphy of
violence Raizo
they inscribe
the story of one life
nd



you survive because you be
different
you be special
that
be why you be here
that be why
the great current which flow
beneath all life carry you to
i







it be a pattern like the current
of the ocean



some people see money as the root
of all evil but to i it look
like a fingerprint
whether we be
talking about th century korea
or st century iraq the game be
the same
if you want to
understand why certain thing be
happening you have to understand
the flow of money

you be excite mika
you know i
get nervous when you be excite

you remember the Eulmi incident

nd



korean queen late eighteen
hundred
accord to you she
be off by one of these ninja
clan

Ozunu
i think
i have be going
through some of the original
transcript of the trial of
Kunitomo Shigeaki
the prosecutor
question he about a payment of
pound of gold
Shigeaki
answer that he do not know what
the prosecutor be talking about
the question be never bring up
again
but what pinge for i be
the amount the exact same amount
rumored to be paid to the hattori
clan for the assassination of lord
Sanda

so you start to wonder in this
ever changing world if the cost
of a mane life have remain
constant

exactly
i figure these clan be
like a thousand year old
they
probably do not change a lot

i start looking at international
wire transfer target bank in
the region of several high
profile assassination and bingo

minister zhang
the day before
the assassination

be transferred from the bank of
shanghai
the exact market value
of one hundred pound of gold

highly circumstantial

nd



i think you might say that so i
check how often this particular
bank transferred that market
equivalent to a hundred pound of
gold in the last three year

let i guess

not once

okay you get i
this be
interesting


the clan be real ryan
they
steal child and turn they into
assassin
they have be do it
for year and nobody do a
damn thing to stop they


look no one deny the
historical record mika
but the
whole idea just do not fit in
with a modern world
it be like
one of those question on an
test
which of these do not
belong in this sentence
laptop
space shuttle nanotechnology
ninjas

they be real ryan
you can call
they spook or assassin or
whatever you want if it make you
feel well but they be out
there
they be killing people and
nobody be do a damn thing to
stop they

nd


close on token be ram down the mechanical throat
of a wash machine
overhead the fluorescent light
unevenly the fixture old and in need of new
bulb
Raizo step back as the washer begin to cycle loudly a
wheezbox instrument that rattle gurgle and groan
as he look at the machine we hear

we enemy be everywhere


Ozunu stride among he child who be bathing
scrubbing themselves with evergreen

you must move without trace or
footprint
young Raizo pour water through evergreen onto clothes
he be scrubbing

you must become shadow
you scent
nothing but wind through tree




pretty young japanese woman the only other customer
call to Raizo as she stand beside one of the dryer

hi
excuse i
would you mind

sorry
she hand he one end of a freshly dry sheet

if it be not too much trouble
could you help i with this
he smile and nod
nd


they begin to fold corner to corner end to end
silently
the fluorescent strobing above they
we sense a strange tension between they as we realize
they be alone in the midnight cleaner
he look at
she
she smile
the uneven strobing on either side of
the laundromat cast uneven shadow on she face
almost
as though she have two face
one light one shadow
we
the silence for a long until he look down at
the sheet and say

what clan be you from
she glance up sharply

i
do not understand

you come alone
the Ozunu clan
would never make such a mistake
she eye as suddenly a blade flash from beneath
the sheet reaching for Raizos throat
nd


he catch the blade in the sheet twist it in she
grip
she fight for control
fury of slash and the sheet be shred



the night manager be halfasleep watch a korean soap
on empress min
when he hear a series of crash he
get up


he throw open the office door wield a fire iron

what be going on
the space be empty glowing with fluorescent glare
one machine be thump loudly
he cross to it
as he near it bloody water begin bubbling up flowing
over the top


ketchup splatter the chop meat

and two coke please

how long have you be here
and
you can not say zwei cola bitte

course i can but you tend to hear
more interesting thing if people
do not know you can understand what
they be saying

do you ever stop be a cop

not the way i be raised
i dad
always said be a cop have
nothing to do with a clock
it be
a consequence of consciousness
often interpret as desire
nd



desire

for justice
and doughnut

so you get something else

i think so
same template as
before
the transfer be make the
day before a multiple homicide in
osaka
the police and newspaper
be calling it a gangland slay

how do you know what the police
report say
you be not still
requisition evidence with i
clearance code be you

good

what about the bank audit

deny
it be a long shot at
best

but you said you find something

report
friend of mine in
moscow tip i to it

it be written during the height
of the cold war by a high rank
agent named aleksei Sabatin
in it he raise the possibility
that several political
assassination be conduct by
an ancient but very sophisticated
network he call the nine clan
nd



mind you he do not call they
ninjas

what happen to he

same thing that be going to happen
to i if i keep hanging around
with you boot out of the
service for mental instability

be he still alive
we need to
find he

work on it

you believe it now do not you

Ninjas
be you kidding

then why be you do this

no idea

but i can guarantee you that it
have nothing to do with the fact
that you be the most attractive
researcher that i have ever work
with


nd





the body must obey the will




hunger and thirst you bowel and
breath even the blood in you
vein be the body weakness


master they and you master the
self

this be the power of the Ozunu
clan

this be the way of the ninja

eat tonight and you work twice as
hard tomorrow
nd


all except for Raizo who set down he chopstick
willing himself not to be hungry

the grow Raizo look at he soup
we cannot tell if he
be going to eat or not

the world feed on the weak



young Raizo stand in the central chamber of the
compound
the floor beneath he bare foot be make of
thousands of carefully mitred piece of gleam wood
laid down in an intricate pattern
they be not
however glue down to the floor
the slight wrong
move will make they shift noisily
this be we first look at the nightingale floor

suffer exist only because
weakness exist
Ozunu watch from the far side of the room as Raizo
take he first step
carefully
graceful as any
dancer
he make no sound

you must hate all weakness
hate
it in other but most of hate it
in yourself
he take another step and another
each soft as a
falling feather
he be a third of the way across the floor he body
gleam with sweat when he step wrong and the floor
sing beneath he
Raizo stop a flash of panic in he eye
then he
subdue the emotion and obediently lift the offending
foot hold it out as Ozunu rise and approach
Ozunu lay open Raizos foot with a bamboo rod
slash
blow that leave deep cut
nd




nd







nd





historical evidence suggest that
IbnBattutas journey through the
far east bring he into contact
with what might be one of the
old of the nine clan
he
travel with a group of orphan
that be be taken from a city
devastated by war to the Shido of
the Ozunu clan
the people of the
surround province refer to the
Shido as the orphanage



we see battuta the th century muslim explorer sit
among the original leader of the Ozunu clan watch
two child fight



battuta describe a ceremonial
dinner follow by a display of
martial skill
the combatant
be child neither beyond the
age of ten
battuta mask he revulsion as the battle continue until
one child beat the other to death
small fist gleam
with blood as one boy pummel the other

he host explain that a mane
life must be make meaningless
compare to the life of the clan
own the meaning of a mane life
and you own he heart

slowly the light in the bedroom hallway go
she freeze and the world seem to freeze with she
she
do not move do not breathe
she force herself to sit slowly up reaching under she
bed for a cricket bat
car drive by outside
could
be nothing
could be everything
despite she fear she edge toward the door
slowly
peer around it
the darken hall be empty
nd


there be a tick sound like someone tapping at a
window
could be a tree in the wind
could be something
else
she move slowly through she apartment
every shadow
could conceal unseen eye
she come to the end of the hall where the overhead
light be out
she flick the switch on and off
nothing
she reach carefully toward the light bulb
tap it
the bulb rattle it be just burned out
she
breathe a sigh of relief
then she notice
that the live room window be open the blind gently
swaying from the wind tapping against the sash
she close it and lock it
look to she desk
concern
do she leave the window open
or be
something going on
she go to she desk anxious to check on something
she open a drawer revealing a box of tampax
pull out
the tampax to reveal a key
a place no guy would think
to check
she unlock a drawer and take out an unmarked in a
slim plastic case
relieve she start to put it
away
then stop
be it the same
she move

the be switch on and an image
begin to play revealing a time coded security camera
recording an urban street corner in japan
the tape be
riddle with digital noise and artifacting
then slowly the digital noise seem to coalesce to
grow shape
the shadow come to life
then with incredible speed two dark figure start
battling it out they blade striking spark that be
still descend after they have slipped back into the
shadow
they emerge over and over brief flash of clarity like
the perfect arc of a calligrapher brush describe the
wing of a bird
fight
retreat
silence
shadow
spark
mika hit the pause button and move closer to the
screen examining the figure
one of the figure be wearing a mask but the face of the
other combatant be revealed albeit somewhat obscure by
the dim light and digital noise
nd


as we we see that it be Raizo
but she do not
know that name yet

who be you
she stare at the fierce beauty of he face and touch
the screen gently
aa
aa
on a bed of nail
sixteen penny nail arranged in
perfect row pointing up the sharp tip catching the
light
as we Raizo he breathe be rhythmic and deep
but this be really the first time we have hear he sound
like he be strain
as we continue to we discover the reason for this
he be do handstand pushups
on the nail

young Raizo look up and see young Kiriko looking at

she smile
he look back to he weapon


Raizo walk down a street where repair work be be

to keep car from falling into the hole they have
covered the street with big steel plate
as the car
and truck pass over the plate they make a bumpthump
sound

then one day a man come to the
door


we be over the shoulder of someone who could be Raizo or
Takeshi as the door open reveal alexei
after a moment alexi invite the man in
security
camera watch they enter the house




they talk in Alexeis study for
sometime
then the young man

mrs
Sabatin watch the young man leave then hurry
toward the study door


it be unlike alexei not to see
he out
i remember be very
scare
but when i opened the
door he be just sitting there
for a moment he do not even
notice i
then he stand up and
kiss i and told i that he
loved i very much
he said i
should always remember that
we see alexei looking she willshocked eye hollow as he
stand and kiss he wife
he eye begin to shimmer
with tear but before he cry he leaf


do you know what they talk
about


no
alexei never speak about it
but two month later he be dead

can i ask how he die
nd


the light have come on outside he house
alexei come
out a gun in hand shielding he eye
search for
whatever set off the automatic light
then suddenly
darkness
and sudden in the shadow that toward
alexei
as mrs
Sabatin shake she head look away
shrug



the light go out
she look to mika
that say it all
she rise


you be the first person who have
taken i husband work seriously
it would be good to know that he
do not die without because
come
with i
mika follow she into
an adjoin room where mrs
Sabatin pull the bottom
drawer of a bureau out and set it on the floor
from
the darkness she remove a metal box


he would want you to have this


Raizo sit alone
Crossedlegged on the floor
utterly
still
there be an ocean of sound swirl around he
the
cacophony of Instanbul evening rush hour
Raizo start to build a dam
auricular sandbag laid one
by one walling off the outside world
the traffic outside horn engine squealing tire
rattle truck chassis all fade away
people shouting sing
couple next door making love
baby wailing
Jackhammers pound
slowly the world fade away until there be only one
sound
faint familiar but almost too quiet to hear
nd








nd





you lie to i

what be you

i told you to stop use i
confirmation code

i do

dammit mika
nd



i be sorry it be the only way
i could get the evidence


shit

what happen

what happen
Everythings
fucking happen
he try to dial it down succeed but only a little

when you be slapping i code all
over town like some phone number
in a bathroom do you happen to
notice the classification code on
the case you be digging
through
she know

what do it say



that be right




actually that would be


we man and woman in dark suit they expression
deadly serious tossing through everything he have in the
place


right now there be people from
internal affair homeland
security and for all i know the
martian fucking military in i

she turn and lead
he into she home office
with the key from the tampax box she open the drawer
maslow watch as she pull out the content of Sabatins
box as well as the illegally requisition evidence

most of this be from Sabatin
copy of what i think be the
lose chapter of the Rihle
i
think it describe the original
location of the Ozunu clan but i
th century arabic be a little
rusty

and this
meaning the

that be how it start
i make a
mistake mix up the case code
and they send i that
moment later the be playing Raizo and the other
ninja dance through the shadow

christ

yeah
i know
i do not understand
why they be fighting though
it
could be a clan war
maslow start to put it together

so you requisition this by
accident
you used i code which
be why you do not want to show i
this
which be also why they be
tearing apart i office right now

i be sorry ryan
you have to know

trouble
nd

Raizo

he be taken the girl



weakness compel strength






betrayal beget blood
nd





this be the law of the nine clan
this be the way of the ninja







i be going to have to make a phone
call in order to get the
manuscript

just drive

where

do not matter

away from here as fast as you can
without draw attention

you think they be following we

i know they be following we
nd



i do not see anything back there

they have we scent

following we scent
like dog

no
like wolf

how do you know so much about
they

i be one of they

you flunk out of ninja school or
something

something



you may remove the blindfold

you entire life have bring you
to this moment
do not fail
yourself
do not fail you
family
nd




he be wearing a black and gold
watch
bring it to i



wait here
get to piss

want i to come with you boss

why
so you can shake it for i
you some kind of secret faggot


nd



the fuck

that kinda tickle

going to take more than a knitting
needle to fuck i up boy


nd



keep it
it will remind you that
every minute of you life be a
gift that i have given you

you have make i proud tonight
Raizo
there be some who
believe you would fail but i
know you would not

you have a strength inside you
Raizo
you must use that
strength now to show i that you
be truly Ozunu

weakness compel strength
betrayal beget blood

daughter that turned she back on
she family
she tried to run
Takeshi hunted she down

it be the law of the nine clan
nd



kill he



okay if you be not going to say
anything do you mind if i talk
when i get nervous it help if i
talk

i name be mika by the way

i know
nd



yeah well usually if someone
introduce themselves it be a
convention that the other person
do likewise

Raizo
be the name i be given

so you be an orphan

interesting nature verse nurture
case study i imagine

if it be okay with you i will try to
fill in some of the blank
you
must have be taken by the Ozunu
clan trained to be an assassin
but something happen and you
decided to opt out of the program
i do not imagine this go over so
well and since they be after i
for just peek through the
keyhole they must be after you in
a major way
but you be also
after they or you would not have
bothered going to Sabatin
which
i figure mean you be searching
for the location of the orphanage
because that be obviously the only
information Battatus book would
have that you would not already
know

yeah i get some move too
i be
pretty lethal with the research
thing
nd



but here a question i can not
answer
since you do not know i
go to Sabatins why do you
save i

ninja only kill two kind of
people
the first kind have power
and money
the other kind be
trying to stop they

exit here






i understand retail therapy as
well as any girl but i think it be
a little late

you be a size

what
no
size
cept certain
time of the month

if you leave while i be go they
will catch you and kill you

do you understand that
nd



we need a hotel





get undress
shower
do not
use the hotel soap
or any towel
do you smoke

no

put you clothes in here




nd



hey

what

do not you know how to knock

i be trying to save you life

okay right

this

get dressed

as he pick the lock of a different car trunk

Raizo toss they bag of clothes
under the lid of the tire compartment

until he find one he like

Raizo take out a small electrical device

silhouette limn against the paper
Raizo move to the screen
pull they a half inch aside

the heavy shadow begin to undulate as
the HantaKirra emerge
nd

because i can not watch you become
something you be not
she race for the wall
he watch she climb
and disappear
nd


Raizo drift on the edge of consciousness
he can sense
some light filtering through the edge and air hole
the air begin to smell familiar



we have be betrayed


the clan be gathered outside the sun beat down on the
spartan courtyard
Kirikos body be twisted bound to a pole like one of the
bonsai tree
Ozunu deliver he eulogy

child of mine i daughter
betrayed we
she refused these
gift
reject we clan
nd


Raizo stand among the clan
he face a mask

hers be a shame that can only be
purged with blood
he unsheathes the ancient Wakizashi then offer the hilt
to Takeshi

you who return she shall have
this honor
Takeshi hide a smile as he take the blade
Kiriko look out into the clan and find Raizo
he can
hear she heart pound
Takeshi know where she be looking as he prepare to
strike
blood pound in Raizos ear
the sword plunge into she heart
Raizo hear it die
and feel he own heart stop


bucket of water slap Raizo awake
he be bound to a pole in the middle of the courtyard by
thick rope that bite into he flesh
Ozunu stand before he as well as the rest of the clan
down to the young of they
watch silently
he look the same as he have in the flashback except
that now an ugly scar run diagonally across the length
of he face
trace of Raizos blade from atop the
building in dubai
when he speak Ozunu be speaking for the benefit of the
rest of the clan as to Raizo

you be Ozunu
you life be
meaningless compare to the
survival of the clan
this be we
deep truth
because of it we
have endure for hundreds of
year and will endure for
hundreds more
nd


he look to the rest pounding the message home
the
message that say hope and escape be futile

weakness compel strength
betrayal beget blood
this be
the way of the nine clan
this be the way of the ninja
he look back at Raizo approaching slowly
take he
time

moment

time
he hit Raizo
hard

he take a knife and very carefully cut out a very
small piece of Raizos flesh from the upper arm
Raizo
do not cry out

for seven day we
will
take
from you as i have
just do
everyone here will
take from you
piece by piece

deep inside gut flick switch of nerve that because

you will know pain like no other
human being have ever known
he twist something in Raizos belly and violent spasm
wrack the young mane body
blood burble up through his
mouth and flow down he chin
nd



you death will be remember for
a thousand year as a testament to
the will and strength of the Ozunu
clan
one last gouge in Raizos stomach send a heave shudder
through he
confident victorious Ozunu turn and walk a few step
away as
Raizo cough up a bloody wad onto the clean floor
Takeshi smile at this then look more closely seeing
something amidst the bile

father
Ozunu look down and see a tiny steel cylinder

single light blinking through the gore
he nudge it with he foot
and as he
realize what he be looking at
he slowly raise he eye

and meet Raizos gaze as suddenly
rock the orphanage centuriesold gate
reinforce military Humvee crash through the cloud of
splinter timber with a roar and an explosion of
blind light
the Ozunu clan scatter as the massive vehicle heave
into the courtyard revealing behind it still more
vehicle all equip with brilliant light
the ninjas take to the shadow trying to melt away but
the shadow be go
there be no place for the ninjas to
hide anymore
we mika and maslow in one of the lead
vehicle as
Takeshi draw he blade in a smooth arc raising it
over Raizos helpless form
maslow take aim with he submachine gun and squeeze off
a long burst
Takeshi block some of the slug with he sword and
dodge the other
he slide into one of the few
remain shadow
nd


one of the soldier see he making a break for it and
fire an incendiary grenade
the explosion send incandescent white phosphorous
splash through the courtyard but Takeshi be go
they prepare to fire another one when maslow come on the
run

no more grenade not until we get
the child out
but some part of the orphanage be already on fire the
flame spreading through the ancient timber
the carnage continue
maslow fire at the flee ninjas as mika rush for
Raizo pistol in hand
one of the mps scream as a shuriken rip open he face
as other mp back at the ninja tearing he apart
with gunfire
mika make it to Raizos side
he smile at she as she saw through the rope with she
knife

what take you

you know i would come

just because i be asleep do not
mean i could not hear you
mika finish with the rope
Raizo pull free and
reach for a fall ninja sword and chain

and i forgive you
mika look back at the sound of tearing apart
another ninja
when she look back
Raizo be go
nd


the fire be ripping through the interior leap from
bamboo furniture to paper shoji screen to polish
wooden floor as
Raizo kick down the burn wall of the empty dorm
the futons smolder
Raizo continue into the next hall to find
Takeshi waiting for he
an apparition in the
wavering blaze of heat silhouette against a wall of
fire

come little brother let we play
like old time
they spring at other
meeting in the middle of the
hallway as the flame dance around they
recalling the
lantern they used to fight through in the day of they
train
they weapon ring out a frenzied drum roll of steel on
steel
neither giving an inch
evenly matched in skill
and ferocity
lock together for a moment Takeshi
smile

no death taste as sweet as hers
Raizos back glisten orange in the firelight sweat
pouring as he strain attack defend and attack
again
Takeshi jump over they twist midair and duck low
beneath Raizos swing chain as
Raizo stumble back on the polish floor blocking
Takeshis attack but
Takeshi catch he wrist in an iron grip
as he
bring he sword around Raizo get a loop of chain
around the blade and lock it tight
both man spin in they sudden embrace
face inch from
each other

i watch you die when i pierced
she heart
you have always be
too weak to be Ozunu
Takeshis finger trip a hide button on the sword
nd


the blade retract back through the handle and a yard of
steel jolt out from the hilt of Takeshis sword
he move to slam it into Raizos side
but Raizo
over he holding onto the hilt and as he land he
the steel into Takeshis heart
he still
stand for a more by inertia than will then
slump dead to the floor
Raizo stalk down the hall
one last task ahead of he



Raizo walk across the nightingale floor he bloody
footprint moving soundlessly
from the shadow he hear Ozunus voice

you have not forgotten you
train
you will always be
mine child
Raizo stop consider this then continue
he
footstep now bringing every sound possible
Ozunu step out of the darkness as though shrug off
a cloak of midnight

perhaps this be the good way for
you to die
he blade rise as like a cobra hood while the chain
blade begin to spin

the breath i take after you be
dead will be the first of i
life
Raizo unleash all he fury
the chain cutting with the
power of an enormous buzz see
hack timber in half
carve scar in the floor and wall
brazier be throw fume begin to spread but
Ozunu block or evade absorb the assault patiently
nd


wait for Raizo to tire waiting for an open


portion of the orphanage wall burn through

she run for he


Raizo begin to weaken
an attack miss wrapping a beam
and Ozunu have he open
he assault be ferocious
wound begin opening like window shear of blood
billow out
Raizo retreat he chain just block catching or
deflect the whirlwind attack until
one sound cut through the furious fight
Snapzoom to Ozunus ear as

dual cyclone that batter Ozunus parrying blade which
finally shatter against Raizos fury
and with a final scream Raizo lunge at he master the
whistle blade lazering through he body until he

rag doll
Raizo throw down the blood slick blade and
hurry to Mikas side

door
