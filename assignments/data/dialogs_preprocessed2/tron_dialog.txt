as astonishing advance in computer
science be make artificial intelligence
program be be design to assist
we in every area of life


in a worldwide network of electronics
they travel through mile of circuitry
at the speed of light
we created they to
calculate and research to help we design
and heal and think
with all that they can
do be they only electrical impulse
or be they a new form of life

























aagh
god lisa i almost have you that

that knuckleball get they every
time boy





you be get brutal sark
brutal and needlessly sadistic

thank
you master control

we might be capture some military
program soon
that interest you

sure i would love to go up against some of these
guy
be a nice break from these
account creampuffs you keep sending
i
which branch of the service

strategic air command

nice


look this be all a mistake
i be just
a compound interest program i work
at a saving and loan
i can not play
in these video game

sure you can pal
you be a natural
athlete i ever see one
come on

be you kidding
i
i run out to
check an the TBill rate i get out
of breath
hey really
you be
going to make i user mr
henderson
really mad
he be a full branch manager

great another religious nut



welcome to luxury live

uh thank but
i do not even know
what i be do here

you believe in the user

sure if i do not have a user then
who write i

that be what you be do here
master
control program be snap up
all we program who believe
if he
think you be useful he take over
all you function so he get big
an if he can not use you he send you
down here to the game grid to get the
bit blasted outta you
what be you name

crom

i be ram
they will train you for
the game but
well i hope you
make it okay
hey what be going on
in the other sector
i have be stick
in this grid for microcycles

it be murder out there
you can not even
travel around you own microcircuit
without permission from that master
control creep
haul i down here to
play game
who do he calculate he be
if only tron be still around

you ever see that guy in action
Hundredpercent independent

could not tell he what to

what be wrong
what do i say




oh i user
Tronthey have get
you in here


not for long friend






think we can merge into this memory
okay good buddy



now ol flynn said to look over
in here





but i do not see what he be looking
for
i would well get over to that
inputoutput tower and let he know





come on you scuzzy little data
be in there


i have get such nice blue paper to
print you out on if you will just sit
still




uh oh
we get company

coming into shape again
but red this time
no

you said it
one of those
Recognizers come after i
going to hafta jump clear out of
the data stream









oh i
the long arm o the law











ah hell
busted again
as we




get a pirate program here
say
he name Clu

Whatd he pull

come into the system with a steal
password
an we caught he
tryin to raid a highclearance
memory

look up he face
wrack with pain
no
i must have get in there
by mistake i

who programme you


you be in trouble pal
big trouble
but if you tell we who put you up
to it you could make it easy on
yourself
come on who be you user

forget it mister high n mighty
master control
you be not
makin i talk

suit yourself

get i dillinger






hello



mr
dillinger



yes



hello please hold a moment for the
master control program



will you be around for a while or
be you going right back out

oh i will stick around a few day
get some thing to take care of









hello ed
thanks for coming back early

no problem MasterC
if you have see
one consumer electronics show

what be up

it be we friend the boy detective
he be nose around again

flynn

yes
it feel like flynn

he be still looking for that old file
can not you just appropriate it

i would if i could find it
it be stash
somewhere off in the system
out of i range
meanwhile

meanwhile he might find it

i be afraid so
i spotted he this time
and kick he out but he be get
tricky all the time

i think we would well shut off all
access till we can find that file
just to be safe

there be a
percent chance
you be right

cute

end of line






access to the program
user code bailey
password




huh




come on in

alan
alan bailey

oh yes
the algorithm on cloud
seeding
great piece of work
how be it going

well i do not know
i just tried
to run this program i have be working
on and i be denied access all of
a sudden
i think maybe i would be
laid off and nobody told i

oh you have group access do not you

yeah

we have to close that down just
briefly
security reason
someone
with that access have be tampering

i hope you do not think it be i
i do not even balance i checkbook on
downtime
i have get a honeywell at
home for that

no no i be sure but you understand
it should only be a couple of day
what be the thing you be working on

it be called tron
it be a security
program itself actually
monitor
all the contact between we system
and other system
if it find
anything going on that be not scheduled
it shut it down
i send you a memo
on it

mmm
part of the master control program

no it will run independently
it can watchdog the as well

ah
sound good
well we should have
you running again in a couple of day
i hope

ok

oh boy

ed i be so very disappoint in you

i be sorry

i can not afford to have an independent
program monitor i
do you have any
idea how many outside system i have go into
how many program i have appropriate

it be i fault
i programme you to want
so much

and i be planning to hit the pentagon
next week

the pentagon

it should not be any hard than general
motor be
but now
this be what i get
for use human

now wait a minute i write you

i have get time smart since then

what do you want with the pentagon

the same thing i want with the kremlin
i be bore with corporation
with the
information i can access i can run thing
to time good than any human

if you think

you would not want i to dig up Flynns file
and read it up on a at the new
york time would you

you would not dare

so do as i tell you
keep that tron program
out of the system
and get i those chinese
language program i ask for
end of line











well here go nothing

hah
interesting interesting
you
hear what you said
here go nothing


well i mean

whereas actually what we propose to
do be to turn something into nothing
and back again
so you might just as
well have say here go something
and here come nothing
hah

let i make sure we be running


look good



let er rip


perfect

beautiful

hello alan

boy i sit up there grindin away
all day and you guy be down here
disintegrating thing and have fun

not disintegrating alan digitize
while the laser be dismantling the
molecular structure of the object
the computer map out a holographic
model of it
the molecule themselves
be suspended in the laser beam
then
the computer read the model back out
the molecule go back into place and
voila


great
can it send i to hawaii

yes
but you have to go roundtrip
and you must purchase you program
at least day in advance
hah

how be it going upstairs

frustrating
i have tron almost ready
to run and dillinger cut everybody
with group access out of the system

ever since he get that master control
program set up system get more bug
than a bait store

well you have to expect some static
computer be just machine after all
they can not think

they will start to soon enough

yes will not that be grand the computer
will start think and people will
stop
lora i be going to stay and run some
data through
see you tomorrow



do you say group access

yeah
pain in the neck you know
i be all set

do he say why

something about tampering
some body
prob trying to siphon the budget
into he checking account i do not know
why be you so interest

flynn have group access

flynn have access to you too
i be not
interest in talking about he

oh i wish you would forget about that
it be all so long ago
i have totally
get over it

okay okay

i want to go to he place

you call that get over it

i mean i want both of we to go



what for

to warn he

of what

that Dillingers on to he

for what

for be on to dillinger

what














through the aisle past the absorb kid



hey where be flynn tonight



it be all in the wrist friend

hey
good to see you guy
nothing
class up the place like a cleancut
young couple

we have to talk

good luck
you can not even think in here



come on




stretching he
arm relax
so
how be the world of serious science

have you be sneak into the
system

whew
you never be much for small
talk
she still leave she clothes all over
the floor

flynn

uh no
i mean not that often

to alan
indicate arcade
you can see why all he friend be
fourteen year old

touche honey
yeah i have be do a
little hacking here
which i have get
every reason as you well know

you do break in

try to
nod toward
terminal
can not quite make the connection with
that sucker though
if i have a
direct terminal

be you embezzle

embezzle be such an ugly word
mister bailey
no actually i be trying to get a
legal brief together

i do not get it

you have not tell he


sherman set the Wayback machine
for
oh
kevin flynn
be one of the bright young
software engineer at
he be so
bright that he start going in there
at night and set up a private memory
file and begin writing a program
for a video game he be invent
called
wave at one of the
game in the room
space paranoid

you invent space paranoid

Yepper
and vice squad and meltdown
whole slew of they
i be this close
to starting i own little enterprise
but
enter ed dillinger
another
software engineer not so young
not so bright but very very sneaky
one night we boy flynn go to his
terminal try to read up he file
and
nothing
big blank
we now
take you to three month later
ed dillinger present with five
video game he have invent the
slime do not even change the name
and he get a big fat promotion
thus
begin he meteoric rise to
what be
he now executive


senior exec

oh i
meanwhile kid be putting eight
million quarter a week in space paranoid
machine and i be not seeing one dime

i still do not get why you be trying to
break into the system

because somewhere
in one of those
memory
be the evidence
if i get in
far enough i could reconstruct it


i password
Dillingers instruction to
divert the data

i be afraid it be a little late for that
Dillingers shut off group access
he must
know what you be up to

boy i bet i know who be workin late tonight

dillinger

yeah
tryin to find the file and erase it
once that be go be not nothing can stop he
just eddie and he master control program
runnin thing from on high

do not even say that
you have get to find that
file before he do

not much chance of that now
the can just
slip it into another system as soon as it
locate it

not if i tron program be running
that
would seal the system off
if you file in
there

boy if we be inside i know how to forge
we a group access

shall we dance



dillinger be seated at he computerconsole desk
gibbs stand
face he

ed all i be saying be if we own
people can not get access to they
program
you know how frustrate
it be when you be working on a piece
of research

walter i sympathize but i have data
coming out of the master control program
saying there be something screwy

that you know that be half the
problem right

the be the most efficient way of
handling what we do
i can not sit and
worry about every little user request that

user request be what computer be for

do we business be what computer be
for
look walter with all respect
be not the business you start in you garage
anymore


we be billing account in country
we have get one of the large system in
existence

oh i know all that
sometimes i wish i
be back in that garage

it can be arranged

that be uncalledfor

i be sorry walt
so much pressure lately
you feel like going for a drink

thank you no

i be certainly not

move aside
let the kid have some room



okay
flynn i be going to put you at
i terminal down in the laser lab
we will be up in alans office

swell
i will log we both on and you
can get you tron thing run

as long as we stay off the top floor
Dillingerll never know we have be in
here













this laser i life work
do not spill anything




access code
password series
reindeer flotilla


you should not have come back flynn

hey hey it be that big master control
program everybody talking about
you do not look a thing like you picture
tell i have you really be think
about world domination like they say
type


activate

activate

activate

that be not going to do you any good flynn
i be afraid you

continue
slightly shaken
stop flynn
you realize i can not allow this



typing




terminate control mode
activate matrix storage



now how do you expect to run the
universe if you let a few unsolvable
problem throw you like that
mon
big boy let we see what

you be enter a big error flynn
i be going to have to put you on the
game grid

game huh
i will give you

over a circuit pattern like the one







oh man
this be not happening
it only
think it be happening




hey
take it easy
look if this be

open communication

yes

i have get a little challenge for you sark
a new recruit
he be a tough case but i
want he treated in the usual manner
train
he for the game
let he hope for a
while
and blow he away

you have get it
i have be hopin you would send
i somebody with a little moxie
what
kind of program be he

he be not any kind of program sark

those little wimp put together
human they can not even keen they social
order in one piece

Butwhat if i can not

you rather take you chance with i
want i to slow down you power cycle
for you

wait
i need that

then pull yourself together
get this
clown trained
i want he in the game
until he die playing
acknowledge

yes
acknowledge master control

in here program

trying to grab
the guard arm
who you callin program program







looking over
he shoulder
new guy

another free program off line
what be
he user pose to do

the user
you really think they be
still there

they would well be
i do not want to bust
outta this dump an find nothing but
a lot of cold circuit waitin for i


hey
who be you guy
what be the story around here


you want to watch those force field


you will be have plenty of chance to
get hurt do not worry about that

look
just so i can tell i friend
what this dream be about okay
where be i

you be a
guest of the master control
program
they be going to make you play
video game

well great that be no sweat i play
video game good than anybody




look operative you guy
command
program sark will explain the train
procedure

recite a
routine statement
greeting
the master control program have
chosen you to serve you system on the
come grid



those of you who continue to profess
a belief in the user will receive
the standard substandard train
this will result in you eventual
elimination





those of you who renounce this
superstitious and hysterical belief
will be eligible to join the warrior
elite of the




you will each receive an identity disk
everything you do or learn will be
imprinted on this disk



the master control program regret
that it cannot be responsible for
identity disk lost or stolen
if you
lose you disk or fail to follow
command you will be subject to
immediate deresolution
that be all



held immobile while a laser scan
he mouth

file past a checkpoint
each
be hand a disk

file out into a train area

the year the cost be really

about to
get bore
yeah yeah that be great

how about yourself

oh uh
i do not remember too much

sure a little disorientation
that be
normal when they transport you
it will
come back to you
you be do real
well in train
remarkable really

where do you hear that name

well be not it

the name of i user yeah
but how


i uh
i be a program from a user
that
know alan

he be disoriented in transport tron

yeah but i be remembering all kind of
stuff
like
i user want i to go
after the





that be what i user want too


i know

what do you think

do it












get they
send out every game
tank in the grid
get they


watch it

Recognizers









game tank
come on




oh man
when you be on the other side
of the screen
it all look so easy



to one of the bridge
personnel
get the pursuit force back into
there be no place else they could be

we will have they in no time sir
long
before the interrupt interface

we well null unit
i will be lucky if
the do not blast i into a dead zone
i want those program



it be all circuit
must be an inputoutput component

the tower yes flynn have you
remembered anything else about
yourself like what sector you be
from

sitting down
against a rock
well
i home sector be called
Paramus


wonder what those initial
stand for
start counting they
off on he finger
probably program
assist routine well it sound like
a lovely place

it grow on you

i can feel it

feel what
you okay

AlanOne

yes
he be get something to tell i

you think we can make it there

we have to

pointing to a corner
of the cave
hey what be that

it be just what we need



oh that be nice
you always forget how
good fresh energy feel till you get
to a pure source
have some
you will need it

well
when do we pay a call on the ol
master control

what just the three of we

you know anybody that be get an army for
rent that be fine
but i uh user said
to go take that sucker out
an let we
face it the big ox be not going to get any
weak
i feel like hittin he now
while i be good an mad
some nerve
what do he care whether you guy get

tank
coming back
let we go




how about over there
that empty
memory

no good
they might block off the
old chip
this way



the bridge
come on










make contact with master control
he will be please to hear we be all
finished with that user he send we






you going to make it







holding onto
the wall
what be going on

we be inside a Recognizer
you be crazy stealing a Recognizer

stumble trying to
keep he balance
be you kidding
i think it be stealing we






you okay
you do not look so good


hang on

smile hug
she tightly
Yori
hey

oh tron
i know you would escape
they have never build circuit that could
hold you

pulling he by
he hand
this way
come on



artillery for video game sector

all mathematical function
transferred to

i can not believe how bad it be get
around here since the start
taking over
all the good function
have shut down
everybody look so dead
i be afraid to even go out during downtime

that be all going to change Yori

how

do not know yet
i have to get
in touch with alan
he be going
to tell i how to














i quarter

why be everything
like this

it be a flat
but wait a micro


come here


you be beautiful Yori


you have grow big program

i have to
in the game










this honey do not handle so good
in town

no nuhuh never in a million year

Ixnay
Noper
under no condition

that be more
like it
right confirmed i could not have
put it







catch i listening to you again



hey
hi
hey everything okay
fine
little trouble but we be okay
thanks
for you concern
so long

this town full o live one

not a chance



i have to reroute the insurance
information bit
next cycle we
start the war game simulation for
the
do you make that account
receivable adjustment for sark
certainly
the want only
minimal function left in sector

i











dumont


yes

i
have come to communicate with
i user

hmm
difficult proposition
difficult proposition at best
perhaps you have notice
we be not
exactly packing they in these day

yes
what

you know not so long ago you
could have come in here and see
program line up all the way back
to those door waiting for communion
with they user
the build fund
be do well too
but now
this socalled master control
program be going around cutting
program off from they natural
creator grab all we believer
and making they ride around on little
motor scooter and shoot thing at
each other and weiner know what all
oh it be enough to give you a crisis
of faith

well i want to communicate

oh you want to hah
i could
get myself derezzed justfor letting
you in here
they hate this tower
they would close it down if they dare
to but they keep i around in case
one of they want to deal with the
other world once in a while
and
you should hear the way they commune
sound like they be routing a
payroll for all the heart they put
in it
no i do not think you

dumont
i user have information
that could could make this a
free system again

hah

really
you would have program lined
up around the block to use this
place and no looking over you
shoulder

when you have be in the system as long
as i have you hear many promise
many reassurance
many brave plan


who be you user program

AlanOne
he call i
may i pass

all that be visible must grow beyond
itself and extend into the realm of
the invisible

you may pass i friend








this be where tron said he be going


look like he kind of place too
real serious





hut
hut
hut
hut
hut


















all right



the bit upset around flynn nervously


sshhh i be still i
just a different
color
mon




i




that old fruitcake dumont
he will pay for this



bring in the logic probe




















dumont







location query
location query
confirm

confirm AlanOne

there you be
look before we get
cut off again



i be going to put some new code on
yourdisk so you can get into the
memory core of the master control
when you get there









search all password code series

wait
i can not hear








dumont
the door




i have wait for this moment many
thousands of cycle
it be time for the
new order to begin
the user be
waiting
as Yori step forward up the step








dumont



where be the program

program
i be sure you be mistaken


take he








this way
there be a simulation
we can use




can it carry we


the design be good
we do not know
why the user abandoned the project


yes
it can take we across the
sea of simulation
all the way
out of the game grid
to the

looking out
of hangar
as long as it get we out of here










Yori
get down



















we be off





i hope you have enjoy be a command
program sark
i wonder how you will like
working in a pocket calculator
maybe
one of those watch that play happy
birthday to it user once a year

now sir
we do take care of that
user you send we

yes and now you have get two renegade
program running all the hell over the
system in a steal simulation

we will get they sir
these thing
take time

i do not have time sark
and neither
do you
end of line




tron be you all right







buzzing around Trons
head like a fly
no way not on you life no siree
nothing do forget it





flynn


greeting program

you be alive

yeah i
oops



who be this

flynn
he turn to
flynn eagerly
where be ram

i be sorry tron
he be
he do not make it

this be flynn
the one who
bust i out

then i owe you some thank

no big deal
i ought to know i way
around that light cycle routine
i mean i do write the program for it

write the

it be time i levelled with you tron
i be a well i be what you guy call a
user

user in we world

guess i take a wrong turn somewhere

but if you be a user then
everything you have do have be
part of a plan

you wish
man i have not have a second
to think since i get down here
i mean
in here
out here
whatever

then

look you guy know how it be
you just
keep do what it look like you be
suppose to even if it seem crazy and
you hope to hell you user know what be
going on

well that be how it be for program
yes but

i hate to disappoint you pal mostthe
time that be how it be for user too

stranger and stranger

you said it

so
nice ship you get here
what be we
next move

remember you wanted to pay a call on
the


we be on we way
AlanOne give i the code we need to go
up against master

all right
thank god
alan stay awake
at least



sir what do you want do with
the tower guardian dumont
put he with the other

no bit brain

prepare he for inquisition
i need
a little relaxation
but first rez up
the carrier for pursuit
and one other
thing

Dontthink anymore
i do the
thinkingaround here





what about we friend sark

probably decided not to pursue we
the sea of simulation be tricky
lot of illusion
rough navigating
program have a way of just
disappearing here

not we i hope

shake he head
indicate disk
not with this disk
i be going to
check on the beam connection Yori
you two can keep a watch out for
grid bug

boy the view from up here
you
know the territory

little
over there the mountain of data
and i think that be the silicon valley

what be wrong with that area


the blasted it
there be very
few domain left with any power at all

lousy utility company
they be the same wherever you go







what do you want
i be busy


busy dying you wornout excuse for
an old program

yes i be old


old enough to remember the when he
be just a chess program
he start
small and he will end small


throw back he
head and laugh
that be very funny dumont
maybe i
should keep you around just to make i
laugh


guard
bring this antique to the
bridge so he can watch he friend
be obliterate








what be it

power surge
the transmission beam
too strong

we have to get off this beam

i can not
there be no junction due for at
least or nanosecond




there be another beam

it be too far





where be he going



the beam connection
but he will be derezzed





















do we make it

yes

hooray for we side




hey
you guy

how about you

aah i be fine
little hung over
be all

how do you do that flynn

elementary physics
a beam of
energy can always be divert
ooh i head
look around
to Yori
be we there yet mommy

almost
i just have to adjust we
course at the next junction
i would well
go check the instrument







sark




















quietly Yori

tron


he be dead

sigh look
at flynn
and who be this

he be a user dumont
he come to
we world
trying to help we

if the user can no longer help we

so
we have erase the program that


you
no


you die
i see you

not i boss

well
we can take care of that
soon enough


take this program to the hold pit

dumont

i be taking we friend here and
some other religious fanatic to
master control
the have expressed
an interest in assimilate they
probably for archival purpose
i be not going back to the game grid
on this ship though i will take
the transport beam
less traffic
but when i disembark
this ship
and everything that remains
on board
will automatically derez
this mean you
enjoy you trip











dock module prepared to disengage sir

















hey

continue
turning
look the door almost




Yori

why
how


i be going to need you help
hey bit

yes

let we get outta here








i be delight that so many of you
could turn out to give you
power over to i


you be very lucky all of you
you
be participate in the creation of
the single most powerful program in
the history of the system
of all
system

program with a will
with
ambition
a superior form of
life



go




welcome



check out the control

we be get close









dumont i be so please that we have
finally come to term with one
another







i do not know how you survive
slave


it do not matter
prepare to
terminate




i can rev this baby up a little

wait a minute Yori









flynn we have get to help he

let we get some power here



you be very persistent tron





i be also good than you






very clever tron
you know you
should have joined i



any response

it be starting



we would have make a great team







it be very good that you



i do not think it be good for you


sark
how have you allow this
program to



Sarks out
would you like to
leave a message

i be the message
the only message
sark




trying to pull
dumont away from wall
dumont

no
tron
must
destroy

first

dumont
where be Yori
where be
flynn

they may be
derezzed
on
the carrier
hurry



program
stop
this be not allow


i will not allow this sark













Yori steer we over the beam
right next to it

why
what be you going to do

jump

but
will not you be derezzed

probably





flynn
you can not
i

lay finger on
she lip
shhhhh


i be sure tron would not mind if
just once


do not worry





end of line program

















nice

it be something user do

where be flynn

he be go
he go into the beam
he saved you
he saved all of we

he really be a user

yes








hey you guy

flynn
i make it
i worked out some
new code for tron put they on a disk
and it be running

i know i meet he


i mean i see it readup
hey look at this

you old file

and Dillingers instruction to
divert they it be all there
look even he home phone number
when he logged on

oh that be beautiful
you have get
the goods

you be telling i




you have any idea how much i can sue these
joker for



well just do not forget you old friend

be you kidding
you guy he running
this joint by then



you friend dillinger sure will not



hey you know anybody who want to
get hold of some video game
cheap



you be get out of the business



should not you wait till you
lawsuit settled



nah
i decided
i have have enough of
video game to last i a good long
time
i feel like gettin into some
real life
