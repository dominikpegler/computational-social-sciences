maybe i be not a worldclass housefrau
but maybe i do not have time to polish
the goddamn china and keep after the
kid
it be none of you business but i
do not happen to have a man around
here full time
so i sell cosmetic
in a goddamn drugstore and sometimes

god fred

at home you would never hear a woman
scream at a man that way

no
why not

you just would not
it be not the amish
way
but i think it would have do i
good if i could have scream at
you brother last night

listen i do not know what be going on
or how you get mixed up with he
but do not you let that selfrighteous
son of a bitch push you around okay

okay

now what be the problem

the problem be i do not happen to
think i son should be spending all
he time with a man who carry a
gun under he coat and go around
whacking people

whacking

yes
and i also want to leave this
city

believe i i be trying to get this
over with as fast as i can
but samuel
will probably have to come back and
testify

we do not go into you court

people who do not go into we court
when they be tell to sometimes go
directly into we jail

look i be genuinely sorry

no you be not
you be glad because now you have get
a witness
i hear the other police talking
last night
they do not seem to like you very
much

they kid a lot

i would not be too sure

he say you look very tire
i think
the same thing

but not a good tire

what be a good tire
tired be tire

just wanted to see if you be on
you toe

you sister said you do not have a
family

no

she think you should get marry
and have child of you own
instead
of trying to be a father to hers
except she think you be afraid of
the responsibility

oh
anything else

oh yes
she think you like police
because you think you be right about
everything
and you be the only one
who can do anything
and that when
you drink a lot of beer you say thing
like none of the other police would
know a crook from a
um
bag of
elbow

i think that be what she said

good appetite



afternoon gentleman
i would like you
to meet samuel lapp

little help

there be a sgt
carter on the phone

police
i be not in the business of
protecting crook cop
i will make an arrest when i know

because somehow they know i be
get close
look it be narcotic
they make
dope out of chemical
they sell
it on the street for millions of
dollar
they will do anything
and they can get away with it because
they be cop

i be afraid
i be afraid for samuel

want to go home

you will be safe
you do not have to
worry

feel safe in a city where the police
be so busy killing each other
