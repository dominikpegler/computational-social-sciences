use the ladder on one test
battalion
yours
just in an
infintessimal dose in the food
supply to prove it effectiveness in
the field
they be sure you unit

okay
and he be talking now
he know
i name

he be go


thus at the core of today discu
sion we find four fundamental doc
trines
first that the world of
matter and individual consciousness
be both manifestation of one divine
reality

even you mr
palmer be part of it
as amazing as that may seem

second human being be capable not
only of kowledge about this divine re
ality by inference but can realize
it existence by direct intuition
superior even to reason

third man possess a double nature
an ego and an eternal self what we
call spirit or soul


fourth and most important mane
life on earth have only one end and
purpose to learn to let go of the
separate ego and to identify with the
divine spark within

almost impossible to believe be not
it mr
palmer that somewhere in that
unconscious head of yours lie the
source of all consciousness

yes sir
very hard

well now have reach this
apotheosis there seem little if
anything left to say
so rather than
try you be dismiss

hello prof

middle of the war
the draft
nod he head
they walk a moment in
silence
i will tell you prof after viet nam
i do not want to think anymore
i
decided i brain be just too small
an organ to comprehend this chaos

looking at with
affection
jacob if it be any other brain but
yours i might agree
tell i do you lady friend know
what a brilliant thinker what a sub
lime intellect she be living with

i doubt it be i mind that interest
she
i tell you prof she be a fiery
lady

with a fatherly
demeanor
well try not to get burned
you have
a great mind jacob
do not let anyone
tempt you away from it

i have get a problem prof
more Augus
tine than kierkegaard if you know
what i mean
look at he
questioningly
i need to know about
demon

demon jacob
why demon
be you
write


no
i see they

see they
he smile uncomforta
bly
what do you mean
physically

yes

i know very little about demon ja
cob fleshy one anyway
i know they
as literary figure biblical one
dante milton
but jacob
this be the th century
we do not
see demon now

i see they prof
everywhere
they be
invading i life

christ i know how it sound

have you considered a doctor
psy
chiatrist

yes
i do not want they
i be not looking
for analysis or drug
it be too easy
to dismiss as some kind of psychosis
he pause uncomforta
bly
it be more than that
i can feel it
i
need you prof
you be the only one i
can talk to

i do not know what to say

i need you insight you intuition

demon
i do not know what to tell
you
it sound like a spiritual mat
ter to i
the problem jacob be
that you have no context for it
you be a renegade existentialist suf
fering demon a hundred year after
freud
how the hell be i suppose to
make it fit

i be afraid prof
nothing make
sense
please help i

jacob i do not believe in demon not
in the empirical sense
i do not be
lieve in devil fighting for we
soul
i do not believe in enternal
damnation
i do not believe in other
worldly creature torment we
we
do not need they
we do a good enough
job on ourselves

but i see they

look
i do not pretend to know what be
going on inside you head
for all i
know it be pathological and they
should be pumping valium into you
vein by the quart
but if you be not
will to accept the help of sci
ence
and believe i i admire you
for that
then you will have to do bat
tle on you own
what can i say
it be
a lonely pilgrimage through we time
even for the strong soul
but to
be pursue by
demon no less
there be no guide jacob
you want to know what i would do if i sud
denly start seeing demon
i would hail
the first taxi that come along shoot
over to Bellvue and beg they for
shock treatment
i be no saint

hell you think i be

Ivenever understood you you know
that
you be by far the good pupil
i have ever have bar none
Intellectu
ally you be the most original the
most imaginative
who know maybe
you have be elected to see demon
maybe you be in touch with
some
thing
nothing would surprise i
about you jacob
nothing

he be burning up

total delirium

he will never make it

that be some gash
he guts keep
spill out

push they back



help i

i think we be losing he

the reverend norman murphy leader of
one of the large group support
the armageddon committee told we
camera that we be no long deal
in decade but year

the battleground be be ready
we planet be the battlefield
we
soul be the prize
all the sign
point to the inevitable confrontation
between the force of good and evil
people must choose side
there be no
draft evasion in this war
all be
called
all must take up weapon
be
you prepare
that be the question we
ask

do you find people scoff at you
reverend
after all there have be
doomsayer for thousands of year and
we be still here

people be less apt to laugh these
day
the prophecy be too close
for comfort
i mean all you have to
do be watch the news

there be some who claim that you
pessimism be defeatist and what the
world need now be hope a positive
thrust

i think the time for hope have passed
the seed have be planted
we shall
reap what we have sow
pessimist no
i think we be
percieved as the only realist
around

in an
interview
