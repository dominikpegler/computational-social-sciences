i friend you have escort i
home
i beg you to free yourself
of you vow
return with the
boat
i know how heavy you
heart must be this far from you
family and native land

because i love they so dearly
i cannot dishonor they

i think you would say that

no man control i destiny
especially not one who attack
downwind and stink of garlic

if we position be reversed
i would have do the same
only i would have succeed

come aslan
by nightfall we will
celebrate you honor when we dine
with i father


you owe the sheriff three bushel
of flax

you starve we
first the drought
now you take what food we have
left

for starve people you look
fat enough

emerging from
the hut
he be not here sir
none but the
woman and child

where be you mate
the man
they call little

he die last winter

be that so
we hear he be very
much alive
hide out in the
forest
he probably run away
to escape you scolding tongue

norman swine


no wulf
do not
twill only
make it bad

seize he

this be lord Nottinghams deer
be this how you repay the sheriff
for he protection

like a wolf protect sheep

i killed it
we needed the meat

poacher hang
either he die or
you die

i mother lie to protect i

no wulf

you have deprived we of a hunt
boy

the hound know the scent well

run boy

give we
some pleasure before you die


unleash they

why must you walk in back of i

in you land be i not the infidel
the unbeliever the instrument of
evil

we race have fight for a
hundred year to prove that point

then i trust it be safe to appear
as you slave than as you equal

for an infidel you have uncommon
clarity of think
yet you
refuse to tell i about you home
and family

those be i burden

you speak i language
you have
the diplomacy and honor code of
a nobleman
i ask again why
be you to be executed

so i must continue with i
guesswork
you be highborn
probably
you fell from favor
clearly
why
you broke the
law
you be a rival for power
woman

such beauty that they can possess
a mane mind that he would be
will to die for they
be
