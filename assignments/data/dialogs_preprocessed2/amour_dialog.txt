there
can you come in please

some banal romance or other
about a nobleman and a low middle
class girl who could not have each
other and who then out of sheer
magnanimity decide to renounce
they love in fact i do not quite
remember it any more
in any case
afterwards i be thoroughly
distraught and it take i a bit of
time to calm down
in the courtyard
of the house where grandma live
there be a young guy at the window
who ask i where i would be
he be
a couple of year old than i a
braggart who of course really
impress i
to the movie i
said because i be proud that i
grandma have given i the money to
go all alone to the cinema


what do you see
i start to
tell he the story of the movie
and as i do all the emotion come
back
i do not want to cry in front
of the boy but it be impossible
there i be crying out loud in the
courtyard and i told he the whole
drama to the bitter end

so
how do he react

no idea
he probably find it
amuse
i do not remember
i do not
remember the film either
but i
remember the feel
that i be
ashamed of crying but that telling
he the story make all i feeling
and tear come back almost more
powerfully than when i be actually
watch the film and that i just
could not stop

that be cute
why do not you ever
tell i before

there be still a few story you
do not know

aha
do not tell i you be going
to ruin you image in you old age

you bet i will not
but what be i
image

sometimes you be a rotter
but
you be nice

can i take you for a drink


listen to this
i horoscope
motto
you have lots of verve but
need to be more serious
love
highclass conversation be
what you need
work
you be motivated again
but
proceed with care
health
loosen up by do
exercise
it will give you renew
pizzazz

you have only yourself to blame if
you read stuff like that

tomorrow afternoon be Pierres
funeral

you have to go

i fear i must
i do not want to go
at all

who do like going to funeral

oh i know a few people who do
annette can never wait to get all
doll up again
and francois
have

what would you say if
no one come to you funeral

nothing presumably

have you talk to jeanne since i
be in the hospital

of course

what do she say

she be shock

how

they be shock
she could not
believe it she be speechless
i
do not remember any more
in any
case not exactly
i have spoken to a
lot of people since

sorry

no i be sorry
i do not mean to be
unkind but i just do not see the
point of talking about it all the
time

do i talk about it all the time


no
sorry

do not worry

what


once she be seated in the

why be you back already

how be the funeral

anne

how be it go on tell i

it be rather bizarre
the priest
be an idiot
then one of Pierres
coworker make a speech that be
embarrassingly emotional
he old
secretary come with a radio
cassette player and after the
speech she put on yesterday by
the beatles
you can not imagine
everybody turned round to look at
she
apparently it be not planned
he grandchildren be there
of
course they giggle as soon as the
music begin
then the urn be put
on a huge stretcher that be
obviously design for a coffin
and out we go into the rain
they
place the urn on a small electric
cart that crawl along for what
seem like an eternity to the tiny
hole they have dig
lot of people
have to stifle they laughter
it
must have be terrible for jeanne
i have


there be just no point in going on
live
i know it can only get
badly
why should i inflict it on
we
on you and i

you be not inflict anything on

the feel she be totally unaware
of the state she be in

feel the opposite
it be
i do not
know

and what about the doctor
what
do he say

give she the necessary medication
and there be no other option
right now

option
why be not she in a
hospital

she have a second stroke
Bertier
examine she and feel we could
spare she all the hospital
inpatient procedure


anyway they would not keep she
they would send she to a care home
what they do in those place we
can do here

and she will not be put in a care
home
i promised she that

do not you think you be taking on
too much

believe i i love you mother as
much as you do
so please do not
treat i as if i be a total idiot
incapable of do the obvious

i be simply
questioning whether what i see
going on here be the answer to
everything

do not you want to get a second
opinion

we will
hold on i will tell you a
story
but you must be quiet i
can not talk too loud it wear i
out
here we go
when i be
little
well i be not as little
as all that
it be toward the
end of primary school so i be
about ten dad and mom send i to a
holiday camp
they think it would
do i good to spend the summer with
kid i own age
we be lodge
in an old castle in the midst of a
magnificent wooded landscape
i
think it be in the auvergne
i
do not know
in any case it be
the opposite of what i would
expected
we have to get up at
and go for a morning swim
not far
from the castle there be a pond
feed by an icy mountain stream
we
entered it running in a double
file
you know i be never very
sporty
they have a program to keep
we on the go all day probably to
nip any potential pubescent
impulse in the bud
but the
bad thing be the food
the third
day after we arrival there be
rice pudding for lunch
i hate rice
pudding
we sit at long table in a
huge hall
i do not want to eat the
stuff and the housemaster said to
i
you will not get up until you have
clear you plate
so after the
meal everybody left the room and i
remain seated in tear
i have
make a secret pact with mom
i be
to send she a postcard every week


if i be please with the place i
be to draw some flower on it or
if not some star
she keep the
card
it be covered all over in
star
after three hour i be
allow to leave the table
i go
up to i room get into bed and have
a fever of degree
it be
diphtheria
they take i to the
near hospital where i be put in
an isolation ward which mean that
mom when she come to visit i
could only wave at i through a
window
at some point i lost that
postcard
it be a pity



i be almost do

you can put you shoe on if you
want

thanks

be not you taking a coat
