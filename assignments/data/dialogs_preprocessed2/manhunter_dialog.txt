you

mom like that too


it be hard to have anything be not it
rare to get it hard to keep it
this
be a damn slippery planet

slick as hell

you remember when we first meet
and be together alone in that
room
and the exhilaration be
too much to hold on to
and then
something flicker across you
face like a shadow and i ask you
what be wrong

i remember

do you remember what you said

yes
i said this be too good to live

time be luck will
i know the value of we day

let we go to bed
i will rub you back


i need to talk to you about will
graham













i will tell you the event
the
psychology none of you business
hobbs be trying to cut he eleven
yearold daughter throat
graham
shoot he with his
six time
hobbs still do not go down
he have
to wade in

that be when it happen

no
it happen when graham go
to see hobbs daughter four month
later in the hospital
she saved
she carotid artery
but lost
three finger and she larynx
she
be connected up to a voice box
when graham go to see she she
ask he through the speaker
why do you have to kill i
daddy

that be when graham have he nervous
breakdown

what be the bottom line

if he push too deep into we boyo
mindset he may destroy himself
what be you planning jack

could he handle a direct contact

i do not recommend it



you do not recommend what sidney

crawford have a proposition
i
do not think it be a good idea

if the tooth fairy listen to
Lecktor he will come for i
so
we be going to set i up as bait
to draw he out
give he a
clean shot

that be what you be think
be not it

i will use Lounds

sidney he do not read the sunday
time literary supplement
he
read Lounds in the tattler

and i want this over with
fast


i believe he be socially
maladjusted
laugh at by his
contemporary

how do he rate compare to dr
hannibal Lecktor

he be not as intelligent

what have we missed

he may have an unconscious
homosexual conflict
fear of
be gay
he object to the word
fairy
plus smear bloodstain
indicate that he put the shorts on
charles leeds after he be dead
i believe he do this to emphasize
he lack of interest in mr leeds

the killer have sexually molest
all he male victim
he be a
homosexual and impotent with
person of the opposite sex
we forensic psychologist have
project he may have be the
product of an incestuous home
life
and probably have sexual relation
with he mother

how long will you stay in
washington

until we have taken out the tooth
fairy

all right

picture

i want shot with i and graham
together
