o
s

so end i last signal until we reach
we destination
we be now on automatic
a mere hundred and five light year from
we base
and at the mercy of com
puters
i have tuck in i crew for the
long sleep
i will join they presently


from a phonograph of stereotape
the astronaut be speaking into a
microphone

within the hour we shall complete
the sixth month of we flight from
cape kennedy
by we time that be

tachometer be given by hundreds and thousands
over this we hear

o
s

but accord to dr
Hasslein theory of
time in a vehicle travel at close to
the speed of light old mother earth have
aged a few thousand year since we de
parture while we have scarcely aged
at all

comfortable boot
he seem calm and pensive
extract the butt of
continue

it may be so
this much be probable
the
man who send we on this journey have long
since be moldering in forget grave
and those if any who read this message
be a different breed
hopefully a
well one

i leave the twentieth century without
regret
who be it
marshall

said
modern man be the missin a link between
the ape and the human being


one final think nothing scientific
purely personal
see from up here
everything look different
time bend
and space be boundless
it squash a
mane ego
he begin to feel like no more
than a mote in the eye of eternity
and
he be nag by a question
ahat if any
thing will greet we on the end of mane
first journey to a star
be we to believe
that throughout these thousands of galaxy
these millions of star only one that
speck of solar dust we call earth have
be grace or curse by human life
i have to doubt it

that be about all
i wonder if man that
marvel of the universe that glorious
paradox who have send i to the unknown
still make war against he brother
and
let we he neighbor child starve

well then earthmen
miss link
salute you
bless you i descendant
hypodermic
then flick a switch au cut off the mozart he rise and








it
continue
as taylor dull the glass lid
shut and secure it
he adjust two dial inside the capsule and lie
back buckle he safety belt
of taylor
he eye be open
he seem serene even enraptured
convey a sense of loneliness of separation and of the passage of
time




loom large as if observed from a spaceship in a spirale orbit of
descent
of it be obscure by cloud cover
even more ofit appear to be
cratered desert of reddish hue
we can however make out a few narrow
green belt and a patch of blue water
would be observed from a spacecraft plummeting from twenty thousand
foot to one thousand foot
it appear that the ship will fall into a
location at lone rock



loose equipment fall to the cabin floor
the cabin
aisle as the ship begin to roll in the water and on the four





o
s

you all right


stewart
stewart


simultaneously the light begin to
moment later they brighten
but not as much as before

there go we primary power
we be on
auxilliary

cabin
taylor dart to a porthole and peer cut


o
s

we be in the soup
we be sink



dodge
read the atmosphere
the console and address landon who be still stare at stewarts

landon
send a last signal

what signal

to earth
that we have landed




there be no sign of vegetation anywhere
to a body
sea contrast sharply to the red sand of the shoreline

on the stricken spaceship wallow like a beach whale a hundred
yard offshore
the porthole of the craft be beneath the water and
only it roof and the tail fin of it tail assembly be visible
the
redhot skin of the ship vaporizes the water around it


sniff the air in the tube and then taking a deep breath announce

it be breathable

o
s

okay
blow the hatch before we lose
auxilliary power

roll but all we hear be scramble and unintelligible noise

it be no use
there she go

forget it
abandon ship

pass a fold life raft up to dodge
when landon reach the ladder
taylor hand he two neatly pack rucksack and landon climb
rucksack then turn and cross the cabin for a last look at








briny
twentyfive percent salinity
near the saturation point

she be still sink




o
s

go
going
the craft vanish beneath the water


go

we be here to stay

shore

well
where be we
have any notion
skipper

we be some three hundred and twenty
light year from earth
on an unnamed
planet in orbit around a star in the
constellation of orion
look off at
the sun
that could be Bellatrix




o
s

too red for Bellatrix


you do not have time to check the
tape so you do not really know
do you
as taylor ignore
he
what go wrong
we be not programme to land
in water

the question landon be not so much
where we be as when we be

we have have a nice snooze
let we start
earn all we back pay


take you soil test dodge
i will
check the equipment

get you sensor

yo

geiger counter

yo

one pistol
twentyfour round of
ammo
two medical kit
one camera
one
loudly to the
other
we have enough food and water for three
day

but how long be a day

good question
landon check you communication
kit


landon
join the expedition

sorry
i be think of stewart
what
you suppose happen

air leak
die in she sleep

you do not seem very cut up about
it

it be a little late for a wake
she be
be dead nearly a year

then we have be away from earth for
eighteen month

by we time
you have turn gray

apart from that you look pretty chipper
for a man who be two thousand and thirty
one year old
i read the clock
they bear out Hassleins
hypothesis
we have be away from earth for
two thousand year give or take a decade
still can not accept it huh

long pause
you know it

because time have wipe out everyone and
everything you care for they be dust

prove it
if we can not get back it be still
just a theory

it be a fact landon
buy it
you will sleep
well

nothing will grow here
there be just a
trace of hydrocarbon and most of the
nitrogen be locked into nitrate

any sign of dangerous ionization

no

okay
if there be no life here we have get
just seventytwo hour to find it
that be
when the grocery run out

which direction

decisively pointing
west
that way

any particular reason

none at all











sweat surround by enormous boulder
taylor look about he

everybody all right
limp rucksack come up with some empty food carton rummage again
coming up with a cigar butt

water check

eight ounce

it do not add up
there be a mantle of
dust around this planet and yet it be
as humid as a jungle
thunder and
lightning and yet no rain
cloud cover
every night and that strange luminosity
and yet no moon

if only we could get a fix

what would you learn
i have tell you
where you be and when you be

taylor quit riding he

you be more than three hundred light
year from you precious planet
you
love one have be dead and forget
for twenty century
even if you could
get back they would think you be
something that fell out of a tree

all right

there be only one reality left
we be
here and it be now
you get ahold of that
and hang on tight or you might as well
be dead

i be prepare to die

he be prepare to die
do not that make
you misty
chalk up another victory for
the human spirit
or unwilling to hear it again
taylor cigar clamp between his
tooth spin toward landon

straighten i out on something
why do
you come along at all
you volunteer
why
a beat
no answer
i will tell you
they nominate you for the
big one and you could not turn it down
not
without losing you AllAmerican stand

climb off i will you

and the glory do not forget that
there be
a lifesized bronze statue of you somewhere
it be probably turn green by now and nobody
can read the name plate
but never let it be
said we forget we hero

taylor
i be telling you

oh and one last item
immortality
you wanted to go on forever
well you damn near make it
except for
dodge and i you have live long than
anybody
and with stewart dead it look
like we be the last of the strain
you get
what you wanted kid
how do it taste

okay
you read i well enough
why can not i read you

do not bother

dodge
he be not like i at all
but
he make sense
hold walk naked into a
live volcano if he think he could learn
something no other man know
i understand
why he be here
but you
you be no seeker
you be negative

but i be not prepare to die

i would like to know why not
you think
life on earth be meaningless
you despised
people
so what do you do
you run away
he tone be soft reflective

no not quite landon
i be a bit of a
seeker myself
but i dream be a lot
empty than yours
i can not get rid of the idea that somewhere
in the universe there must be a creature
superior to man




taylor
over here



life

where there be one there be another
and
another
and another

let we find they all












it be a stream bed
no doubt about
it but bone dry

look



make out a long row of wooden cross
some animal or vegetable matter

scarecrow

let we take a look






never mind the scarecrow

i be an
animal psychologist that be all
we
do not have any authority

you do pretty well when it come to

work have value

hmph

the foundation of scientific brain
surgery be be laid right here
in study of cerebral function in
these animal

they be still dirty
and they bite be

a shovel
i hear you be planning
another archeological expedition



o
s

yes sir
if the academy agree

o
s

the project will require i support of
course


i

o
s

i hope i can count on it sir

o
s
friendly warn cornelius
when you be digging for artifact
do not bury you reputation

o
s

guard


stop
you have hurt he
take they inside



cornelius if you have a moment today i would
like to discuss this expedition of yours
in more detail

certainly sir
i will get i note and come
right over

i do not understand these animal psychologist
what be dr
Zira trying to prove

that man can be domesticate

i





what happen

those fool and they torch
do you
have any ointment

i will see





i be sorry bright eye


i told you what you would get


julius do not
it do not matter


natural bear thief be not they





get i a collar and leash
i be
taking he to the infirmary

he be vicious doctor
besides it be
against the rule

do as i say

you would not hurt i would
you
taylor




it be a stunt
human do not write

dear you be a scientist
do not
you believe you own eye

where do you learn to do this


jefferson public school fort wayne
indiana

back on that planet you say you come from
Umhm
he may be intelligent but he be also mad

and you be a fool

now just a minute

oh cornelius be quiet

dodge be killed in the hunt
what
happen to landon

i do not know

and they fell out of the sky with you

not fell fly


flight be a scientific impossibility

and even if it be not why fly
where would it get you

well now

do you have map



we be here
you be capture about here

interpreting he
movement
you fell in the water here

you come
ashore
you march across the desert
the mountain
many day and night
and reach the jungle

out of the question

cornelius why do you insist on
provoking he

no creature can survive in that part of
the forbid zone
i have be there
i have
see it


then how do you account for i


i do not
and i be not going to try

but what about you theory
the existence
of someone like taylor might prove it

Zira be you trying to get i head cut
off

do not be foolish
if it be true they will
have to accept it

no they will not

cornelius have developed a brilliant
hypothesis

it be probably wrong

that the ape evolved from a low order
of primate possibly man
in he trip to
the forbid zone he discovered trace of a
culture old than recorded time

the evidence be very meager

you do not think so then

that be before dr
Zaius and half the
academy said the idea be heresy

how can scientific truth be heresy
what
if taylor be exactly the proof you needed
mutation
miss link between the
unevolved primate and the ape

he be touchy be not he

i be not a miss link


because if he be a miss link it mean
the sacred scroll be not worth they
parchment

well maybe they be not

no thank you
i will not get into
that battle

oh cornelius show some strength

Zira listen to i
we have get a fine
future ahead of we
marriage
stimulating
career
i be up for a raise


dr
Zaius

do you forget we appointment
cornelius

oh
no
sir
i be just assembling
i note

you know dr
maximus we commissioner
for animal affair

certainly sir
it be a pleasure to see
you again

what be that

man dr
maximus

i know it be a man
and you know the
rule
no animal outside the compound
and most certainly not without a leash


yes sir
but this creature
be a special case

why special

we be conducting a new experiment

would not it more properly be do in
you office

yes sir

guard

return this beast to the compound


o
s

what be this


toy
it float on the air
try it

Zira

nonsense




o
s

what be up lieutenant


we be taking number four over to surgery
in five minute
have he ready

how come
the beast throat be nearly
heal

it be not he throat this time
the vet
going to geld he


o
s

dr
Zira will not like it
she want this
pair to mate




these order come from dr
Zaius himself
there be nothing she can do about it




if only you know bright eye what
they be going to do
stand still now
do not give i any
trouble





of a guard room

taylor

weep if you must but make an end of
sorrow

the faith




cherished husband beloved father
generous master yes he be a font
of simian kindness

he be now in the
custody of the ministry of science


get away from i you dirty ape






and that be when i decided to take
up astronautical engineering
you see
i
be halfway through college and i
it be an old trick
the silent treatment
four week and three day and not a word
from anyone
not Zira
or cornelius
or

i said shut up

ape
ape wearing clothes
it be a madhouse
madhouse



now i do not even have you
imagine i need someone
back on
earth there be nobody
woman yes
lots of they
love making ithout love
that be the kind of world it be turning
into with the help of cynic like myself
so i left it because there be no one
dear enough to keep i there
do i tell you about stewart
there be a lovely girl
the most precious
cargo we bring along
if human life could
survive here she be to be the new eve
it be probably just as well she do not live
to see this

i wonder if it be love between we
look around
smile ironically
what a place to find it








where have you be
why do not you come
to see i

shhhh

what be this

hear

be clever
be quiet

all rise

be seated

this ad hoc tribunal of the national
academy be now in session
president of
the academy preside
on i right dr
maximus commissioner for animal affair
on i leave dr
Zaius minister of science
and chief defender of the faith
appear for the state dr
honorius
deputy minister of justice

let it be clear at the outset that all
matter pertain to this inquiry be
confidential and anyone discuss they
outside this chamber will be hold in
contempt of the tribunal
you may proceed dr
honorius

by you leave mr
president the
tribunal have not yet defined the purpose
of this inquiry

you ask for the opportunity to present
you case
surely you must know why you be
here

i own purpose be to save this exceptional
creature from mutilation

and we purpose be to settle custodial and
jurisdictional question concerning this
beast and determine what be to be do with
he

at the very least this man have the right
to know whether there be a charge against
he

objection
the accuse be indeed a man
therefore he have no right under ape law

well dr
Zira
this be a man be he not


he be unlike any man you have ever see
as we hope to prove

o
s

answer the question
be he a man

sir
the question be the point at issue
be he a man
or a deviate
or a freak of
nature

o
s

objection


sustained
in all fairness dr
Zira
you must admit the accuse be a nonape
and therefore have no right under ape law

then why be he called the accuse you
Honors must think he guilty of something

this man be not be tried
he be be
dispose of
pointing at
Zira and cornelius
it be scientific heresy that be actually
on trial here

well put dr
Zaius
let we warn
we friend that they endanger they
own career by defending this animal


then i will defend myself


dr
Zira tell bright eye to
sit down

i name be taylor

it say here that he name be bright
eye
you give he that name yourself

this hear be absurd
let i tell
i story

bailiff
make the animal be quiet

state you case mr
prosecutor

learn judge
i case be simple
it be
base on we first article of faith
that
the almighty created the ape in he own
image
that he give he a soul and a mind
that he set he apart from the beast of
the jungle and make he the lord of the
planet


o
s

these sacred truth be selfevident
the
proper study of ape be ape
but certain
young cynic have chosen to study man
yes pervert scientist who advance on
insidious theory called evolution



there be a conspiracy afoot to undermine
the very cornerstone of we faith

come to the point dr
honorius

directly mr
president
this wretched man
the accuse be only a pawn in the conspiracy
we know that he be wounded in the throat at
the time of he capture
the state charge
that dr
Zira and a corrupt surgeon named
galen experiment on this wound animal
tampering with he brain and throat tissue
to create a speak monster

ThatOs a lie

mind you tongue madame

do we create he mind too
not only
can this man speak
he can write
he can
reason

he can reason
with the tribunal permission
let i expose this hoax by direct examination

proceed
but do not turn this hear into a
farce

tell the court bright eye what be
the second article of faith

i admit i know nothing of you culture

of course he do not know we culture
because he cannot think
tell we why all ape be created equal

some ape it seem be more equal than
other

ridiculous
that answer be a contradiction
in term
tell we bright eye why do man
have no soul
what be the proof that a
divine spark exist in the simian brain

show this to the president

since the defendant be forbid to speak
in he own defense he ask that this
statement be read into the record

read it yourself

i have come to you from a planet in a
different solar system
i be an explorer
in space with no hostile intention against
you civilization
on i planet it be the
primate man who evolved into a think
animal while the ape remain


stop right there
bring i that paper

this be a joke in very poor taste

be it a joke to seek the truth about
this man

dr
Zira you state here that a ship
from outer space sink in an inland sea
of we eastern desert

i do not state it sir
the prisoner do

do you believe he

like you i find it difficult

but how convenient that the proof of
he arrival have vanished
glance again
at document
you also state that bright eye have two
intelligent companion at the time of
he capture

this be he assertion

where be they now

one be in a museum

dr
Zira
silence that man

how sad
stuff and mounted eh
dead
man like sunken ship can tell no
story
and he other companion

he do not know

mr
president i believe the prosecutor
have reassemble all he surviving human
capture in the hunt along with bright eye

that be true dr
Zaius
i witness
correction i exhibit be on display in
the amphitheater

very well
i suggest we go and look at they





it be he
landon

which one

second from the left


well
do you acknowledge kinship with
any of these creature

with one of they

identify he then
speak to he

landon





john
it be i taylor


you

you know about this

no i swear i never see this
man before

you do this to he
you have remove his
frontal lobe

silence
bailiff take the prisoner inside




mr
president a word of explanation
the
creature in question suffer a skull
fracture during the hunt
two fine
veternary surgeon under i direction
be able to save he life
but the beast
could not speak of course
nor will he
ever speak

you destroyed he memory
he mind
he
identity
and you want to do the same to
i

bailiff
stop this outburst
gag that
monstrosity

you barbarian

may it please the tribunal
i for one
grant that this being cannot have come
from another planet
but this much be
certain he come from somewhere in the
forbid zone
he have described the region
to we and described it accurately for i
have be there

you visit the forbid zone

why yes sir
year ago
with the special
permission of the academy

he exceed he order
he travel permit
be promptly revoke

yes sir so it be thank to you
but
not before i discovered evidence of a simian
culture that exist long before the sacred
scroll be written

objection
these remark be profane and irrelevant

sustained
you archeological theory have no bear
on the disposition of this creature

let they talk mr president
let they talk

sir
we theory have a bear on his
identity

how so

let we assume as common sense dictate
that the prisoner story be false
but if
he do not come from another planet then
surely he spring from we own
yes spring
as an animal psychologist i have find no
physiological defect to explain why human
be mute

objection

sustained

they speech organ be adequate
the flaw
lie not in anatomy but in the brain

objection

sustained

sustain all objection but face the truth

yes
behold this marvel this live paradox
this miss link in an evolutionary chain

silence
you have go too far

there you be mr
president
i warn you
these two would use this hear as a forum
for subversion

you be right
the advocate of heresy have
revealed themselves

mr
president i think an indictment be
in order

yes sir
the state charge doctor Zira
and cornelius with contempt of this tribunal
malicious mischief and scientific heresy

be it so ordered
the tribunal will examine
all the evidence present here and in due
time render a verdict on the propose
indictment and on the disposition of the
deviate in question
this hear be adjourn








wait outside

the verdict be in
at the moment you
simian friend and sponsor be
free on bail
but they will soon be bring
to trial for heresy


what about i

oh you case be preordain
in a way
you perform a service for the state
because you hear make it possible
for we to expose Zira and cornelius
and now the tribunal have place you in
i custody for
final disposition
do
you know what that means

no

emasculation to begin with
then
experimental surgery
on the speech
center
on the brain
ultimately a
kind of live death

however it be within i power to grant
you a reprieve
that be why i summon
you here tonight
tell i who and what you really be and
where you come from and no veterinary
will touch you

i told the truth at that hearing yours

you lie
where be you tribe

i tribe as you call it life on another
planet in a distant solar system

then how be it we speak the same language
even in you lie some truth slip
through
that mythical community you be
suppose to come from fort wayne

what about it

fort
unconsciously you choose a name
that be belligerent
where be you nurture

i take it you do not believe the prosecutor
charge that i be a monster created by
dr
Zira

certainly not
you be a mutant

that be exactly what Zira and cornelius
claim
you be talking heresy doctor

of course

all right suppose i be a mutant
why
do the appearance of one mutant send
you into a panic

because you be not unique
there be the
one you call landon

then you admit

i admit that where there be one mutant there be
probably another
and another
nest of they
where be you nest taylor
where be you woman

thank you for calling i taylor
dr
Zaius i know who i be
who be you
how
do this upside down civilization ever get
start

you may well call it upside down since you
occupy it low level
and deservedly
the eastern desert have never be explored
because we have always assumed that no life can
exist there
save yourself taylor
tell i be there
another jungle beyond the forbid zone

i do not know

if you be protecting other of you kind
it will cost you you identity

i be not protecting anybody
that hear
be a farce
what have i do

you be a menace
walk pestilence
i
do know who you be taylor
as i know
that other of you kind must live in the
forbid zone
you have just six hour to make a full
confession
after that i will employ surgery
to obtain one
guard

take this creature back to he cage

all right you can cut i to piece
it be
within you power
but know this doctor
you do it because
you be afraid of i
you do it from fear






be you julius

what do you want

i be from the office of animal affair
this maleo to be transferred to the zoo

at this hour
who say so

do not they tell you anything
the anti
vivisectionist society be up in arm
they be
going to save this beast from those butchers
in the lab
if he can speak he belong in the
public zoo
but what will probably happen be that some
moneymad grownup will put he in a circus
and then we will have to pay to see what
rightfully should have

stop making speech and show i the order

this order no good
it must be counter
signed by dr
Zaius

hit he

who be you

so you can talk
i be dr
Ziras nephew
this abduction be
she idea
you be not really going to the
zoo
that be just we cover story in case
we be stopped
although i do feel that if it ever come
down to a question of whether something
like you should be public or private
property

come on
get i out of here


o
s

we have get to move fast


she come along too

Zira do not want you female

i want she

if you insist
but i be not taking
any order

fine
just let she out



presence with disapproval
they speak in undertone

i told you not to bring the other one

he would not leave she

all right
get in
hurry
put this on

listen

taylor just keep quiet and we may get
away with this
remember that man all
look alike to most ape





gorilla hunter

keep moving
we can not turn back now








hold it

ah doctor Zira
we wagon broke down
i be
afraid we will have to commandeer yours


you can not
i have two sick human in the
cage
we be taking they to the chief vet
at the zoo

indicate he
own wagon
we bag two live one today
i will have
to ask you to take they along

following he
frantically
no no i animal be diseased
leave
they alone
they be diseased i tell you


give he a taste of fire

stand back
he be dangerous

why

he be rabid
he bite be fatal

you serious

you would die in agony
froth at the mouth

they treat those animal good than they
treat we

i still say the only good human be a dead
human











how do it go

there be one bad moment some hunter
stopped we

i pursuade they we beast have rabies


let i out of here


well taylor we be all fugitive now

do you have any weapon

the good
but we will not need they

just the same i want one

look here taylor
i be in charge of this
expedition

fair enough
but you be no longer in
charge of i
and i do not mean to be
capture again

as you wish

Zaius seem to think there might be
another jungle beyond the forbid zone
that be what we will try for
what about you

cornelius and i have be indicted for
heresy
unless we can prove we theory
we do not stand a chance of acquittal

you be going back to the forbid zone

to the digging i worked at a year ago
it be a three day ride across the eastern
desert near where you claim you landed
from that planet of yours

you still do not believe i do you

it be a long detour to dead lake
what
would we find

nothing much
the remnant of a life raft
maybe a small flag
the emblem of i
countryman

sorry taylor
the terrain around that lake
be poisonous
there be no fresh water no
vegetation
nothing

i know
nevertheless i thank you
for saving we
you will be in trouble for
going there

we have be in trouble since the moment we
meet you
she make whimper sound and point at



hunter emerge from the tree


o
s

what be she pointing at


that be the way home
and she know it

nova
she turn
he shake
he head say gently
we can not stay there
it be not safe

we would well get start
if the mount
police pick up we trail they will come
this far at least

right
let we put the water and provision in
the wagon

be you going to take she with you

yes

actually you be a different breed
this creature will never evolve

maybe not

you want she that much

you threw we together remember
and you
guess right
man like ape get
despondent without a mate








who put they up

the hunt club

to scare off human

to scare we too
we be enter
the forbid zone


do not worry
you will be safe with i
here
it be time you learned to earn
you keep

you can do it
like this








something wrong with you mate


let i handle this
you may be smart than i be but i be
the veterinary on this planet



where do the river lead

it empty into a sea some mile from
here
that be where the cave be




o
s

and beyond that


do not know
at high tide you can not ride
along the shore and we have no boat on
the last expedition

you have never tell i why this region
called the forbid zone

no one really know
it be an ancient
taboo
set forth in the sacred scroll
the lawgiver pronounced the area deadly

should not we be moving on

i be for that


what be the diagnosis doctor
touch
of the sun

she be not sick at all
she be pregnant


so i be not an altogether
different breed you see








you like it

why do you do that
scrape off you
hair

in i world before i left it
only youngster of you age wear un
scrape hair

it make you look somehow
less
intelligent

when be you going to show i what be
in the cave

right now if you like



lucius do not fire at they

you be all under arrest
you seditious scoundrel
drop that
rifle





stop right there

do not be a fool
you be outnumber
and outgun

if there be any shoot dr
Zaius
you will be the first to die
depend
on it

taylor you be not in command here
put down that gun

shut up

very well
lower you weapon

tell they to move around the point
out of range


how do you know we would come here

it be not difficult
only an apostate
or a lunatic would flee to the forbid
zone
i see you bring along the female of
you species
i do not realize a man could be monogamous

on this planet it be easy

i ask you to reconsider the rash course
you have taken
if you be convicted of heresy
the most you will get be two year
but if
you persist in pointing gun in i direction
you will hang for high treason

we have never mean to be treasonable sir
but up there in the face of that cliff
be a vast cave and in that cave a
fabulous treasure of fossil and artifact

i have see some of you fossil and artifact
they be worthless

and that be you minister of science
honor
bound to expand the frontier of knowledge

taylor please

except that he be also the chief defender
of the faith

there be no contradiction between faith
and science
true science

all right let we see if you be will
to put that statement to a test

taylor i would rather you

no
you saved i from this fanatic
maybe
i can pay you back

what be you proposal

when be the sacred scroll written

twelve hundred year ago

very well
if Zira and cornelius can prove
that those scroll do not tell the whole
truth of you history
if they can show you
definite evidence of another culture from an
unrecorded past will you exonerate they

of course

okay
up to the cave

sorry lucius
you will have to stay here
and guard the horse

always giving order
just like every
other adult

relax
you will see it all later









present you evidence cornelius

it be at this level i discovered trace
of an early ape creature stage of
primitive barbarism really dating back
roughly thirteen hundred year
it be here
i find cutting tool and arrowhead of
quartz and the fossilize bone of
carnivorous gorilla

but the artifact lying at you foot
be find here at this level
and
that be the paradox
the more ancient
culture be the more advance
admittedly
many of these object be unidentified
but clearly they be fashion by being
with a knowledge of metallurgy

indeed the very fact that these tool
be unknown to we could suggest a culture
in certain way almost equal to we own
some of the evidence be uncontestable

do not speak to i in absolute
the
evidence be contestable

i apologize

to begin with you method of date
the past be crude to say the least
there
be geologist on i staff who would laugh at
you speculation

perhaps that be why they be on you staff

secondly if these tool as you call
they be unidentified why be they
introduced as evidence of anything

but there be the doll sir

what

right there
the human doll


what do this prove
i grand
daughter play with human doll


taylor
tell he

he have a point
on i planet child
often play with ape doll


doll alone prove nothing
true
but
the doll be find beside the jawbone
of a man and no trace of simian fossil
have turn up in this deposit

you conclusion be premature
have you
forgotten you scripture
the thirteenth
scroll
and proteus bring the upright beast
into the garden and chain he to a tree
and the child make sport of he


no sir i have not forgotten

well
for a time the ancient keep human
as household pet
until the lawgiver
prove that man could not be tamed
keep
digging cornelius
you will find evidence of
the master of this house
an ape


be you going to let that pass without
an answer

yes
i have to agree
from all you have
find so far he position as good as
yours

what be you do there

reconstruct a life
care to have a
look



these be find near the human doll
right
well whoever owned they be in pretty
bad shape

defective eyesight

he wear false tooth
he suffer from a hernia and used
this truss to hold up he inside
and toward the end these little ring
of stainless steel enclose a prefab
ricated valve in he fail heart

i do not say he be a man like an Earthman
but i would call he a close relative for
he be plague by most of mane ill
yet fragile as he be he come before you
and be superior to you

that be lunacy
i can give an alternate
description for everyone of those object
that be equally as inventive as yours
but
it would be conjecture not proof


mamma
mamma
mamma

dr
Zaius
would an ape make a human
doll that talk

lucius




you louse
























tell he to pull back

cease fire
withdraw





i ought to kill you right now
let we go




they take i by surprise
sneak
up on i while i be watering the
horse
what be happen to honor
i get off one round to warn you

they have taken everything

not everything
they left a hostage
how do you feel lucius

disillusioned
but vindicate
i have be right all
along
you can not trust the old
generation
it be a matter of value

all right all right
will you do i
a favor
no order

what be it

i want you to go around the bend and
tell those gorilla they leader be i
prisoner

yes i can do that

good
say i want a week supply of food
for the woman and myself
horse
spade
and fifty round of ammunition

what if they will not agree to you term

then tell they dr
Zaius will not leave
here alive

taylor you can not

oh yes he can
he be a bear killer
deliver the message

sit down
over there

now minister of science let i explain
certain principle stress and strain
if
you exert pressure to remove these bond
