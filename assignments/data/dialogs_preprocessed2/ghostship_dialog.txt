greer to murphy



yeah

there be a large vessel out about ten
mile to the northwest

i be watch it for close to an
hour and it have not moved
i can not
raise it on the radio either
make
i think it might be in trouble

alright
i will be right up

merchant vessel at one seven four
one five west five seven seven five
north this be tugboat arctic warrior
whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero
niner two
over

too deep to anchor out there

look like it be adrift

could be a fish boat

too big
more like a freighter

what the hell would a freighter be
do up here
it be way out of the
lane
there be not a port for
mile

smuggler maybe

smuggle what
tundra grass

do you copy
over

call the coastguard

steer to one eight five
let we check
she out

alright
back it off

hit the light

whoa whoa

chimera


chimera



this be civilian tugboat arctic
warrior
be there anyone aboard

chimera i be hove to at you port
bow
be there anyone aboard

epp come with i
you guy sit
tight

talk to i skipper

we be in a stairwell just under the
main superstructure

this be definitely an old boat maybe
sixty year old
she have not be in
service for at least twenty year
probably a lot longer

it be funny

how be that

besides a little rust everything
pretty wellpreserved

how she get out here be one hell of
a good question
jesus

what be it

murphy

murphy goddamit

sorry

what be it

it be a passenger ship
it be a damn
passenger ship

there be nobody on that boat

probably slipped she mooring get
tangled up in a current

out here
what so a seven hundred
foot passenger liner drift out of
spokane harbor and nobody manage to
bump into she until now

Somebodys probably looking for she
as we speak

whatever the reason she be adrift
and abandoned
we have get every right
to salvage she

you mean tow she back
that be a thirty
thousand ton ship you be talking
about

we have do it before

yeah from one side of the harbor to
the other
but we get half the bering
sea and the whole alaskan gulf to
drag she over

you have any idea how much a ship
like that could be worth in salvage
the fitting alone could go for a
few million

if you get it back in one piece

it be a risk i be will to take

all we get to do be hit some rough
weather and you can forget about it

so we cut she loose and wait it out
little weather could not be anything
she have not see before

it be a bloody navigation hazard
one boat can not control a ship that
size

the damn thing be floating around
for god know how long and it have not
hit anything yet
so we take it easy
little of the old push pull

listen
forget this job just a pay
check for a minute
you know i have
be good to you
but i be prepare
to offer you something well now
if we do this right it be worth a
lot of money
lot of money

go on

salvage fee on a vessel like this
could come in around four million
buck
at least
who know could be
more
could be a lot more
what i be propose be
we split it
four way

think about it
million buck a
piece
you want to spend the rest of you
day dragassing tank barge on the
gulf coast fine
otherwise let we
get to work

roger north island
arctic warrior
over and out

okay
we be going to use a heavy than
usual twin cable rig this time
consist of a pair of number three
gauge braid wire tow
we will tie off through the anchor
alley
and come down to the aft
port and starboard pin
here
thus
we need to get two of these
up there

see as though a foot of one of
these fucker weigh about a hundred
pound it be not going to be what you would
call easy
any question

supposing one of those cable break
under tow

then we will all be doomed
any other
question

ready

bring it on dude





hit it

dodge
you alright

yes

alright skipper real easy

steady as she go

throttle back

more

more

right there skipper
right there



i figure we go through at the Unimak
pass here
refuel at Sanak island

with a little extra fuel weather
permit we should make sitka in
five day without another stop

sound reasonable

hypothetically speaking what if we
get this boat to sitka and find out
somebody want it back

they shoulda think of that when
they let she float away

i do not care what be not nobody just
going to let we walk away with a ship
that size

the law on we side
if they want
to challenge it let they try

they must have scuttle it
nobody
just let we a ship float away

nobody just scuttle a passenger
liner either

ever hear of insurance big boy

either way we find it
it be ours
now

what the

shouting up to the
pilothouse



mother fucker

what be it

throw a turbine blade

son of a bitch

the number one turbine pretty well
trash
number two run but it be
way underpowered

how long to fix

hard to say
i get to get in there
and have a look
at least a couple
day
depend

you think the extra strain cause
it

nah
everything be cool
it be just
one of those thing

some classy tub in it be day huh

yeah



check this out

Everythings still here
ticket
record receipt book of account

one first class passage
elizabeth
james
Dubayy to halifax
january
th

chimera
flag ship of the dobbins
kirk line
nova scotia

looking through
scatter chart and
paper
i would sure like to get i hand on the
general log

that must be the old man right there

look like one hell of a stick up
he ass

he would let you off at the near port
that be for sure

how about now

sixty pound

what
you sure

that be what it say

gete up to have a
look
lemme see

coffee

yeah
thanks

Whatd you find up there

some chart
crew manifest
look like she last voyage be january

the question be where the hello
she be since

she be sailing up north right

she destination be halifax yeah

well suppose she get a little far
north than she should have
get
stick in the ice
the passenger and
crew evacuate
she freeze into the
ice pack which moved far north
where it freeze in solid
they write
it off
fifty year later the whole
global warming thing happen
the
ice melt she get loose and float
around til somebody run into she

as reasonable an explanation as any
i guess

ever hear of the mary celeste

nope

she be a twomasted brig boat sail
out of new york in
one day
she be sight off the coast of
portugal by a merchant vessel the
dei gratia
as the crew of the dei
gratia get closer they discovered
that no one be at the helm of the
mary celeste
on board they find
she completely desert
the captain
he wife they daughter and the
entire crew all go
the last entry
in they log make no mention of any
trouble
the table be even set for
dinner
and in the nine day after
the last entry she sail mile
without anyone aboard

so what do happen

nobody know
Thereve be a lot of
theory of course
but we will never
really know for sure

you think she be sailing without a
crew

i think we would be surprise where a
drift ship might wind up with a
little wind and the right current

you be more practical than
superstitious

only way to be

what be this

turbine rotor shot

i think you said it be just a
blade

metal crystallize
get to replace
the whole deal

how much longer that going to take

like i always say

i know i know two way to do anything

the right way and the wrong way

but how long

hard to say

we get to get outa here dodge

storm blow up and we be history

i be telling you you do not want to
be running that fan like it be

what about running number two by
itself

it be a full horse down
we
could not drag that boat down hill on
ice with it

how long then

i get to pull the blade and reseat
everything in a new rotor

how long

three four day

Goddamit dodge

what do you want i to tell you
that we can throw this sucker back
in and start pulling she like nothing
happen
can not do it skipper

obviously it be some kind of screw

the ship record be not a
hundred percent accurate

man it give i the creep
we get
no business tow a ship that size
anyway
i say we fix the turbine
and hit the highway

be you crazy
do you realize we get
ourselves a ship
we own a ship
dodge

yeah a ship that be suppose to have
be lost at sea fifty year ago
you do not think that be just a little
freaky

if this thing turn out to be a ship
everybody think sink a long time
ago we just hit the jackpot

yeah well how the hell you get
something like that wrong
that be a
damn big boat
it be either sunk or
it be not

we all want to get outa here dodge
especially i
with that boat in
tow
you get three day
make the
most of it

fucker

take it easy dodge
it be only a
piece of metal

inspect he skin
knuckle
damn mind of it be own

morning skipper

morning

you be up late

guess i must have fallen back to sleep
where be epps

go aboard

she take a radio

yeah



what the fuck we going to do with it

what the fuck you think we going to do
with it
it be ours baby
it be all
ours

how much you figure that be worth
skipper

still looking it
over
hard to say
maybe forty fifty
million

ho baby

that be a lot of money for somebody
to just let float away

yes it be

it be a hell of a lot of money

what you think there be something
funny about it

ship with fifty million dollar in
gold aboard adrift
and nobody seem
to care enough to come looking for
it

if they think it be lost at sea
they probably just write it off

not for fifty million
an ocean liner
maybe
but fifty million in gold
they come looking for

maybe they do not want it back
maybe the whole fat deal be insured

maybe
but there be always somebody
whose interest at stake

all i get to say be it look like
that somebody we right now

and it look like somebody get here
before we too

do not happen yesterday i will tell
you that
torn part rusted bad as
the rest of the boat

then it happen before they scuttle
she

you mean before she sink

cargo like this could make a crew
think twice

that it could

then why do not they take it

probably do not have time

or somebody stopped they

either way they must have have a pretty
good reason

must be a damn good reason to jump
ship and leave fifty million dollar
aboard

so what be we going to do
that be the
big question right

salvage claim to a vessel cargo
as valid as a claim to the vessel
itself
it be ours

then we be rich
we be damn filthy
stinking rich

it look like it

so what
we going to unload the gold
and get a move on

we leave it where it be
stick to
the plan

you get to be kidding
what the hell
we need that tub for we get fifty
million buck

so we get a little more for the boat
besides the gold be safe where
it be

yeah but we still get to haul that
big piece of shit all the way back
to sitka

it be worth the effort
believe i
besides we be going to need she to prove
the salvage

why not call for help

for now the good thing we can do be
to keep quiet about this

last thing we want be extra partner

or uninvited guest

i hear that

dodge you get to get on those repair

yeah yeah
i be on it

the sooner we get under way the
sooner we be to spend what be
ours

two hundred twenty
two twenty one
as epps stack the
last one
two twenty two

two hundred twenty two kilogram of
solid gold

that be what i call a payday

hell yeah

murphy

propane tank going to go

bullshit
that boat have not make steam
for fifty year

we can get out of here
how be the
food situation

pretty low all around

we will have to take it easy then
i
do not think we will find much aboard
the ship but it be probably worth
looking around

say we run into this guy again

if he be reasonable maybe we can
make some kind of deal
if not
we will have to reconsider we option

yeah reconsider fucking he shit

Bodiesre too fresh

fresh be not the first word that come
to mind

greek citizen
merchant navy
obviously we be not the first to
come across this ship
they probably
stumble across it just like we do

and look what happen

damn barbaric be what it be

could be mean as a warn

stay away
or else

because of the gold

that would be i guess

so whoever do this might still be
around

maybe Eppss mystery man have something
to do with it

maybe

so what
we report this
call the
coastguard

let we not be too hasty

yeah
hell what difference do it
make if we report it now or later
we call this in now going to be
coastguard who know who all
over the place

to fix that boat i do not know what
be


all the seal and gasket shoot
anything that be rubber burned up

can not you use something else

i might be able to find something on

do what you need to do
just do it
fast

passenger liner chimera
i repeat
chimera
over

how be he do

same
any luck

no
i will try again later

they be dead in the water that
morning
four hour later the
captain relieve of he command
and that evening they issue a general
so be

possibly false
hence the i be going to record
of be lost at sea
i do not think
mutiny out of the question here

on a passenger ship in

if they know what they be carrying

you be saying they mutiny for the
gold

if they be close enough to shore
they probably figure they could get
away in the lifeboat

only something must have go wrong

yeah way wrong

so
i get a question
just from a
you know purely technical standpoint
we call the coastguard
coastguard
show up
what exactly be the plan

how do you mean

well they be going to be asking a lot
of question
about we
about those
body
about the gold
seem like
we oughta be prepared be all

i guess the good strategy just to
tell they the truth

yeah well
the truth be one thing
when there be more than a few hundred
million dollar involve that be a
whole new deal

what do you propose

for starter get that gold off
the ship
what they do not know about
be not going to bother they

there be no way we be going to hide a
few thousand pound of gold from the
coastguard here
besides it will be
safer where it be

with all due respect skipper
part of that up there be mine
i would
kinda like to have a little say in
what happen to it

tell you what dodge
once we get
back to shore you can do whatever
you want with you share
but until
then the gold stay right where it
be

just what the hell do you think you be
do

i do not know what you be talking
about

i think you know

maybe you can tell i then

the radio

the radio
oh yeah the radio

take it easy willya
what about the
radio

you smashed it

what

do not lie to i

what the fuck

you do not want we calling anybody
too liable to ruin you big payday

i do not touch the fuck radio

i do not touch the fuck radio
ever occur to you there be somebody
else on that boat skipper

conveniently enough for you

look i do not touch it
alright

jesus



murphy

it be greer

never be more thirsty in i life

drink up then

how be you feeling

lose i sea leg

any dizziness

no

headache nausea light

light

sudden flash of light

i feel fine

what day be it

i do not know
tuesday

wrong
it be friday

try wednesday

right
wednesday

what happen

you do not remember

last thing i remember i be aboard
the chimera
down somewhere in there
scavenging around

you have be out for about a day

say what

dodge find you out cold in one of
the cabin

oh man

we hear you scream
any idea what
you might have see

i wish i could tell you
i would be real
interest to know myself

the ah
the radio out

what

somebody take it out of commission
last night

smash it up pretty bad

but who

the skipper seem to think i do it
that i be more interest in that
gold than i own safety or the safety
of i fellow shipmate

do you

hell no
you think i be crazy

regardless of how it happen there
be not much of a chance to fix it
the odds of another vessel in range
of the walkietalkies be almost
astronomical
so as of today we be
pretty much on we own out here

murphy

look like part of the general log

the crew have go mad with greed
and fight among themselves like wild
dog over fresh kill


february first

the same day she supposedly go
down

must not be the captain entry
he be probably out of the picture
by then

they lacking diligence have
undoubtedly cause the collision
distress call have be make


collision
with what

the page missing
then they so be
be real

but where be the damage

maybe the other ship take the bad
of it

if it be a ship she hit

dodge to murphy

yeah

you well get down here right now
we be taking water
big time

what the hell happen

turbine chamber on number two must have
blown
take out part of the hull

we be not going to be able to pump it

alright
everybody grab you gear
this be where we get off

dodge



that just about say it all

rotten stem to stern
guess you
could not expect much else

we be not exactly in what you would call
you high traffic neighborhood either

the coast guard have we last position
they will send somebody out soon enough
ship this size you can not exactly
miss

it be a good bet they will be asking a
lot of question when they get here
too

let they ask
this ship legally
ours now

when they find out what it be carrying
they may not be so interest in
what be legal

maybe you shoulda think a that
before you scuttle we boat

the turbine blow

lemme see be that before or after
the oil fire

easy easy

Gettin a little hot under the collar
i would say

shut up

must be a little too the truth eh
dodge

i said shut the hell up

both of you
i do not want to hear it
again

so just stow it
you understand
we do not need this right now



you should not be down here alone

just wanted to check on we little
baby

that oughta buy a man pretty much
anything he want

if money can buy what he want

i do not figure there be much i want
money can not buy

then you be a lucky man

we will stand the watch on deck tonight
you be up first

right

murphy

you must leave

who be you

there be great evil here more than
you can know
leave now or you may
never leave

but

i god

no



you okay

yeah
looking back to the
pool
yeah fine

you would think on a ship this size
there would be something left to eat

after fifty year there be not nothing
left but shoe leather

tomorrow we will see if we can not find
some line and tackle
use some of
those body below deck for bait

there be a charming thought

we can always start shooting bird

what say epp
you up for some
roast albatross

why not

look like we be in a strong current
must be making almost five knot
full on ass backwards

nasty little swell outa the north
west too

let we just hope somebody see we
first out here

it be a Noaa buoy

what

government weather
it be get a
transmitter aboard

let we go let we go let we go

high
you be going to miss it

we be still drifting

the moor have not come taught

it be not going to hold we

do not matter

no fuck way

damn it

hey

hey

could not sleep

wish i could say the same

what do you think happen on this
boat

i guess that be the sixty four thousand
dollar question be not it

the what

never mind
before you time
i think at least some of the crew
go a little nut
the usual stuff
that happen when people stumble on
a fortune
equal part greed and
paranoia usually resulting in
homicide
what happen after that
be anybodies guess
but judging by
we greek friend down below it
do not look like the last time

be we smart enough to avoid that

i do not know be we

when you find i yesterday at the
pool
i would see
something
someone

not we mystery guest again

no
someone else
girl
i be not sure she be
real

not real

what like some kind of ghost

i do not know what else you would call
she
one second she be there the
next she be go

and i have a kind of hallucination
there be other
i see they in the
pool
drown

maybe hallucination be the wrong
word
it be more than that
as though
they be showing i

show you what

what happen

maybe it be one of they do the
handy work on those greek

no
i think they be be just
passenger
innocent victim

victim of what

something bad happen here murphy

that much i think we have already
established

more than just a mutiny
more than
just the gold

she said the ship be evil
that we
have to leave right away
that if we
do not we might never leave

what be that suppose to mean

i do not know

why you
how come the rest of we
have not see these people

just lucky i guess

well
get off this ship exactly
what we be trying to do
short of
that i do not know what else to tell
you

do i a favor and wake up dodge
he be next on

and epps

you can tell the other about this
but for i money i think it be good
you keep it to yourself

dodge
no answer knock
again

what

get up



yeah yeah

from now on nobody come down here

what about the gold

leave it

what do you think

could be a stroke
who know
the general log said the crew be
fighting among themselves
like
wild dog


over the gold

maybe it be more than that

they go crazy

crazy with greed
not crazy
not
like he

we lash a few of these together it
might get we far enough into the
ship lane to be rescue

hard to say which be badly staying
here or taking we chance in open
water

if the weather hold it might not be
so bad

it be not the weather i be worry
about
the wrong current could drag
we as far as the aleutians before we
come across another boat

holding down talk
button

i tell you this because you can see
i
the other can not
but you must
leave
you must leave

epps to murphy

epps to murphy

what happen

we hit land

what

we be in an island chain
it be only
a matter of time before we hit another
one

Greers go
he broke out of the
tank

he be be shoot

let we get the hell out of here

it should be enough to get we to one
of those island
give i a hand
wouldya

prop it here
we need to pull these
brace off
there be a hammer on the
stand
there

i will take that

it be you

you killed they

it be only a matter of time before
somebody killed somebody
you see it coming as well as i do
dodge have he plan starting with
scuttle the boat
and greer too
except he go nut
could not take
it i guess
could have happen in
the middle of downtown anchorage
but do it make he any less
dangerous
i do not think so

so you killed they

the way i figure it it be they or
i
i think putting dodge up on
that pipe be a nice touch
buy a
little time
make it look like whoever
killed those greek be still around
but it be just we on this ship
we
and you
spirit friend

and now you be going to kill i be
that it

i do not want it to turn out this
way

murphy do not you see what be
happening

i think i see it pretty well

it be the ship
the ship making you
think this way

i know a little bit about human nature
and what i have see only confirm
that

it be a trap
there be no way we
be going to get away with that gold
nobody ever do
it be just the bait
this ship suck people in and it
never let we they out

i think maybe you be on this boat
a little too long with all that
supernatural mumbo jumbo
there be
nothing supernatural about greed
and that be what it come down to
pure and simple

i do not give a damn about the gold

i wish i could believe that
either
way you know what i have do
i have
get no choice

i be sorry

there be no reason to make this any
more difficult than it have to be
