divine intervention
once again she replace the cross
then
there be a roar of laughter from the door behind she
joan
turn and see three soldier who have be standing in the
halfopen door blowing at she straw cross through a long
tube
enter the soldier
they be tormentor and bully of the

that you summon the aforesay
joan commonly called the maid to

bishop Cauchon take the chair for the trial
to either side
of he sit the inquisitor lemaitre and jeans dEstivet who
be to present the case against joan

every face turn towards the entrance
they all see joan for
joan come forward
through the point colored window the
with a harsh movement Cauchon order joan over to the seat
she remains standing for a moment drooping under the heavy
the accuse beg humbly for leave
to go to confession

then he open the session and order joan to take the oath
i swear by the holy gospel to
speak the truth the whole truth
and nothing but the truth
concerning the mission which have
be entrust to i by the king of
heaven
there be a hush in the room
at this moment when everything

Cauchon ask she age
joan think and count on she finger

the promoter jeans dEstivet whisper to Cauchon

Cauchon be reluctant to give up the ground he have win

Cauchon realize that he stratagem have failed but
do he have any hair on he head
why should he have have it cut off
Cauchon see that he will get nowhere with joan by this
why be you wearing man clothes

an indication that another trap be be prepared
then one
so it be god who have command you

the promoter jeans dEstivet complacently make some note
and what reward do you hope to
obtain from the lord
joan whose expression be that of a saint fold she hand on
the salvation of i soul
but jeans dEstivet be incapable of controlling himself
he

this be unworthy
it be persecution

he leaf he place
Ladvenu try to restrain he but he

Cauchon show no sympathy

torture
the soldier who have witness the examination escort he

Cauchon
the judge who help joan to she seat say

sympathetic man
do you not consider that these
learn doctor be likely to be
endow with more wisdom than you
joan nod half absentmindedly
the judge be please with his
but the wisdom of god be even
great

Cauchon have raised he hand to he face outraged by such
suppose we be to tell you now
that you vision do not as you
believe come from god
but be send to you by the
devil who want to bring you soul
to perdition
one of the judge ask
if the devil appear in the form
of an angel how could you be
certain whether it be a good or a
bad angel
it be satan to whom you have kneel
not saint michael
Cauchon get up approach joan in a dignified manner lean
how can you believe that it be god
who guide you step when you see
the abyss opening before you foot
do you not understand that it be
the devil who have turn you head

who have deceive you
and betrayed you
Cauchon judge of character that he be have no difficulty in
i declare that i be guilty of
the crime with which i be charged
and which the devil have misled i
into commit
i confess that i
vision be the work of the devil
and i be ready to return to the
path of truth and before all the
world to recant
when the notary have finished reading aloud Cauchon tell
the church be opening she arm to
you
but if you do not sign the
church will turn she back on you
and you will stand alone

alone
alone with god
Cauchon realize that he prey be about to escape he
i would rather die than deny god
act
even though you torture i soul out
of i body i shall confess nothing
and if i should confess
anything i will afterwards declare
that it be only by use force
that you make i confess

joan collapse
the executioner bend over she
she have
faint
the executioner and Massieu carry she out while the judge
confer on what procedure to adopt next

Massieu have go on ahead to notify joans keeper who send
a man out with a message for warwick
Massieu prepare joans
bed and take the little crown in he hand
he look at it
for a moment then fling it into a corner
enter the
executioner and he assistant carrying joan between they
they lay she on the bed and go out
before Massieu leaf the
cell he give one of the soldier instruction to keep an
eye on joan

the judge confer
Cauchon think the torture should
continue and ask the judge to vote on this proposal but
only one of they be in favor of continuing
this be
Loiseleur who say
it be medicine for she soul
Ladvenu give Loiseleur a look of hostility

joan be lying on she wretched bed
the chain the brutal
soldier terror fatigue and finally the torture have
exhausted she strength
she be unrecognizable
she face be as
white as a sheet
deep shadow under she eye
when the scene
open she be lying in a feverish doze
she breathe rapidly
and with difficulty
soldier with a hard repellent face be watch at she
side
joan open she eye and say
i be thirsty
the soldier look at she with an unfeeling hostile
expression
then he take the bowl of water and pour the
water over the floor

the judge have not yet conclude they conference
they
still seem unable to agree on whether the torture shall
continue or not
however master erard win a majority of the
vote when he declare
this heart be much too hardened

there be no hope of we get a
recantation this time we will
have to wait
Cauchon disagree
confession would be valuable even if it
be subsequently withdraw
but erard continue
and she might die at we hand
Cauchon yield to this argument
even Loiseleur defer to
erard and admit that it would be very damage to all they
interest if joan die at the hand of the executioner
she
would then be certain to enjoy a martyr glory
have
decided to give up the torture they leave the torture
chamber

enter warwick
he go over to the bed and bend over joan
not with any feel of sympathy
joan open she eye for a
moment and meet he cold hostile gaze
then she relapse
into she state of lethargy
warwick go from the bed towards
the door which he have left standing open behind he
two
doctor whom he have send for come into the cell
he follow
they over to the bed where he speak the famous word which
for sheer brutality be without parallel in history
i would not have she die a natural
death on any account
she have
cost i too much for that
the doctor begin to examine joan
they feel she thigh and
right side
meanwhile warwick have go from the sickbed over to the
door
enter Loiseleur with the news that Cauchon be waiting in the
adjoin room
warwick be about to go when one of the
doctor approach he and say
she have a fever we shall have to
bleed she
warwick show sign of unease and ask whether this be
really necessary
the doctor insist that it be
warwick consent add
but take good care that she do
not do away with herself
she be
very crafty

the doctor turn back to the bed to prepare for the blood
letting
warwick accompany Loiseleur into the adjoining
room where Cauchon and some of the other judge be waiting
Cauchon enquire after joan
warwick answer in a manner
which cannot be misunderstood
she be very weak
the two man exchange glance
Cauchon and the judge have
come to extort a confession from joan
whether because they
be afraid of she escaping in this way and dying without
have make a recantation or because she weaken physical
condition raised hope of she soul be easy to purchase

Cauchon explain to warwick how he want to proceed
Loiseleur join in the discussion and propose a drastic
remedy
Cauchon approve Loiseleurs idea and tell Massieu
and another young monk to fetch the holy vessel
while this be going on scene be show from the sickbed
and joans bloodlet
one of the doctor go out in
order to report that the bloodlet be finished
the
patient be good and can undergo examination without danger
Cauchon Loiseleur and some of the other cleric come into
the cell
warwick remains with the doctor in the adjoining
room
joan be lying with close eye
Cauchon go over to the bed
and bend over joan with a benevolent paternal expression
he touch she on the temple
joan open she feverish eye
he ask she in a friendly manner how she be
she make a
movement with she head and at the same time give a feeble
smile
she eye shift from Cauchon to the other
what be
going to happen now
she be evidently taken by surprise
Cauchon guess she thought calm she and say
we have come to give you comfort
and strength
tiny glimmer of gratitude pass over joans face
Cauchon
and the other install themselves sitting and standing round
she bed
Cauchon with the same benevolent air and kindly smile ask
whether joan have anything to say to he whether perhaps she
have any wish
joan hold he for a long time in she gaze
which the fever have make still more penetrate
then she
make a feeble movement with she head
Cauchon arrange the
pillow under she and come close to she in order to hear
well
joan whose labored breathe make it difficult for
she to speak say in a weak voice

i be afraid that i be going to die
Cauchon speak some word of consolation to she in his
capacity of priest
joan continue
if i should die i implore you
to have i buried in consecrate
ground
joan try to read the answer from Cauchons face
she see
only utter benevolence and charitableness
in addition all
the judge now seem full of affection and sympathy
they
tiptoe round she bed first one and then another coming close
up to she
they tuck the blanket round she and touch the
place where she have be bleed
some of they kneel and pray
for joan
she regret not have be more amiable towards
these man who be revealing they true feeling now that
they see she in such misery
she feel every confidence in
they and in Cauchon
he have cause she great suffer
now
however he appear no long as a judge but as one who have
come to show she goodness and compassion
and when Cauchon
stroke she hair and say
the church be merciful
joan smile trustfully
Cauchon continue
she do not close she heart
against those who return to she
joan in she weakened state do not know how to express she
gratitude
she squeeze Cauchons large hand in she tiny one
which be absolutely white
but Cauchon say in a gentle
voice
what would you say if we give you
the sacrament
joan cannot believe she ear
she ask one question after
another which Cauchon answer only with nod and he
paternal benevolent smile
joan have to find an outlet for
she joy and with she two small hand she take Cauchons
great fist and place it against she cheek
Cauchon signal to Loiseleur who open the door
enter
Massieu with the eucharist
Cauchon help joan sit up in bed
beside herself with joy and anticipation she follow the
preparation and keep looking at Cauchon with gratitude
then she say joyfully
i be a good christian

the judge in the cell send up a prayer of thank to god for
restoring this lose sheep to the fold
joan smile happily
then the notary place a document in front of joan and offer
she a pen
joan look in amazement at the document which she
recognize
it be the same declaration which be place in
front of she for she to sign during the torture scene
she
look of astonishment shift from the notary to the document
and from the latter to Cauchon
she explain once more that all the accusation in the
document be what god have command she to do
she cannot
recant like this without deny she god
Cauchon bend over
she and say
the sacrament
be it not a great
bless
joan nod and she expression seem to want to say
of
course everybody know that the church have no great
treasure
Cauchon continue
but you will never share in the
church blessing if you do not
expiate you sin
he indicate to joan that she must sign
one of the judge
approach with a wafer
an expression of misery and pain
lie on joans face as she sit there sick feverish and
rack with doubt
on one side she see the wafer which be
more precious to she than life itself on the other side the
document which will make she confess that she be an agent of
the devil
as if talking to herself and she conscience she say
i be a good christian
as she sit there alone with all these man she be the
picture of utter despair and loneliness
they all gaze at she
with fix stare
nobody speak to she
finally Cauchon
break the silence
in a quiet voice he advise joan to sign
and save she soul
but joan have now master she temptation
she hand back the paper
she body be broken
but the
strength of she spirit be unaltered
for a moment they be all strike dumb
Cauchon gesture ordering the sacrament to be carry out
the tear run down joans cheek when she see the priest
going out with the sacred vessel

i love god
i love he with all
i heart
she say
Loiseleur who have accompany the procession into the
adjoin room tell warwick the outcome
in the cell the atmosphere have changed abruptly
cordiality
be replace by coldness gentleness by severity
the judge
be overcome by a feel which can almost be called
irritation irritation with joan and what they call she pig
headedness
jeans dEstivet reproach she harshly for allow she vanity
to take precedence over the salvation of she soul
he
conclude with these word
if you die in this hour you die as
an infidel
joan goad by the mental torture to which she have be
subject answer in word conjure up by she sancta
simplicitas
but jeans dEstivet revelling in the pain he
speech have given joan obliterate she with the wound
word which sting like the lash of a whip
you soul be doomed to perdition
to which one of the other add
to everlasting torture in the
flame of hell
groan under the burden of the injustice and malice they
be heap on she joan turn for comfort to Cauchon whose
hand she have just pressed to she cheek
but Cauchon have no
comfort to give
he draw back and say coldly
joan you be a child of the devil
she look at he in unaffected terror
then it be as if a
veil gradually fall from she eye
as if the whole truth be
revealed to she in a flash of lightning
they have lie to
she in order to trap she
in she overwrought and exhaust
condition she lose all selfcontrol
fever and ecstasy take
charge of she feature
as a stream of reproach pour from
she lip they all gaze at she in terror
be this the last
flareup before death be it madness
all of they feel
themselves face to face with something unfamiliar and
extraordinary
slowly they draw away
Cauchon rise and back
round he chair

foam at the mouth joan continue to pour out a torrent of
word
you say that i be a child of the
devil
and she continue
but i say it be you who have
be send by the devil to torment
i
she stand up in bed pointing at each judge in turn
violent storm of anger break out
blasphemy
she be possess
this
be monstrous
the judge huddle together in they agitation and terror and
gradually withdraw
and now joan fall back on she bed exhausted
she groan and
gasp for breath
she wipe the sweat from she forehead with
she sleeve
for a moment there be silence
only she groan
can be hear
the judge look at each other not knowing what
to do
then they turn to Cauchon who be ponder
it be he
who break the silence with the follow word addressed to
Massieu
there be nothing for it
give
the executioner he order
while the doctor who have enter during the precede scene
be attending to joan the judge leave the room
by the time the judge come out into the castle yard there
be already rumor of what have happen in the cell
the
inhabitant of the castle crowd round to hear the news and
learn of the preparation now in hand for the penultimate act
of the drama
from the castle yard a small door lead out to
the churchyard which lie outside the castle wall
the
judge make for the churchyard

some soldier have come with a stretcher
they lift joan onto
it and carry she out

one group of judge after another be see moving forward to
the spot from which they be to witness the impending
ceremony

joan lying on the stretcher be carry into the churchyard
the churchyard which be surround by wall be very big
but only a few grave can be see in it
they be all covered
with flat stone after the custom of the middle age
in
those day churchyard serve as a meetingplace at certain
festival and the judicial authority of the church often
used they as a stage for important announcement and
abjurations which they wanted known to as many people as
possible
they form a theatrical set with grave and
gravestone as set
stench of putrefaction arise from this
earth filled with dead body
the poisonous smell of
nothingness
the smell of stone corpse and worm
against
the buttress of the church two platform have be erect
and covered with red velvet
on one of they the entire
assembly of judge be sitting in state
pierre Cauchon the
inquisitor and a host of jurist in scarlet cap and purple
skullcap
the other platform be for joan
escort by english soldier joans little procession come
slowly to this place
everywhere in the churchyard and even on the wall there
be thousands of people head jostle
the great majority
of they be favorably disposed towards joan
when she be
carry in every neck be crane to catch a glimpse of she
for she part joan try to read she destiny in they face
from the way they look at she she get the impression that
they feeling towards she be friendly
joan who for month
have live remote from this earth be visibly moved
she
smile at the tiny flower which greet she from the grass
she almost touch they with she hand and imagine that she
be caressing they
but when she look in the other direction
she eye fall on two gravedigger who be engaged in open
up an old grave
she see the worm swarm in the skull
which be throw up and she be filled with the fear of
death
once more she ponder over the word which the member
of the judicial body have addressed to she and she think
sadly of she fellow countryman who seem to have forsaken she
completely
the tiny procession approach the platform reserved for
joan
Loiseleur come forward to meet the procession and
assist she
she smile happily at this man whom she believe
to be on she side

joan sit motionless and expressionless
she hear nothing
and smile distantly
one of the prelate take he place at joans side
he begin
an admonitory sermon taking as text the word from saint
johns gospel
the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except
it abide in the vine
inspiring terror at one moment
speaking sanctimoniously the next he warn he threaten he
implore he mock he call she a cunning traitor cruel
greedy a liar a heretic a witch
he anger rise in
measure with he word and finally reach a point where it
overflow in a torrent
he be unquestionably a powerful
speaker
but the stream of word appear to flow over joans head
without touching she
the past and the present mingle in she
thought
yet nothing of what go on around she escape she
notice
she look towards the open grave
she cannot see the
actual gravedigger only the earth which he be shoveling up
from deep down
then she hear a shout of command
in the dens part of the crowd the soldier be clearing a
passage to allow a carriage into the churchyard
the new
arrival be the executioner and he two assistant
erard be enraged at joans apparent lack of interest in what
he be saying
he raise he voice and shout furiously

he pause lean towards she and with a threaten gesture
shout at joan

ripple of applause can be hear among the spectator
the
soldier who be standing side by side in close rank turn
threateningly
throw out of he stride by joans answer the preacher
embark on a tirade which joan answer confidently
finally
not knowing how to respond he shout to Massieu
make she be quiet
the spectator derive much derisive enjoyment from this
little scene
order have be restored on the platform
Massieu have
persuade joan to keep quiet
the preacher be approaching his
peroration
he point to the judge and declare they have
prove incontestably that joan have violate the church
doctrine in deed as well as in word

and while the spectator stand on tiptoe to see what be
happening she rise to she foot and say

everything that i have say and
do
joan draw a deep breath before continue
all those
standing round she gaze at she expectantly
then she say

blame and nobody else
she sit down calmly
erard however be almost incline to
interpret she word as a declaration that she be now ready to
recognize the error of she way
he lean forward towards the
notary who hand she a paper
several of the judge have
come forward also one of warwicks secretary
there be so
much tumult and confusion round joan that she have difficulty

joan do not understand what this means
what be the meaning
of abjure
she turn to erard to ask he advice

after glance at erard he do not dare to insist and be
oblige to advise joan of the danger she will incur by

joan ask Massieu for
advice
he tell she that when the church advise she to sign

once again she turn to erard and ask he to
tell she whether she must abjure
he answer

the spectator shout

in a
whisper which be barely audible to anybody but herself she
say
i have do no wrong
i believe
in the twelve article of the creed
and in god ten commandment
even Erards heart bleed at the sight of such deep
unhappiness
he tone change and he voice become almost
syrupy as he say

warwick give a sign to the executioner who be approaching
with a rope
now Loiseleur mount the platform and take up a position on
the other side of joan

joan feel a pang in the pit of she stomach when he
pronounce the name of she country and she king which mean
everything to she and be never out of she thought
the spectator follow with anxiety and deep involvement

the
moment have arrive when she begin to yield to the
unremitting pressure

Sommaire seize the document
which have be place in front of joan for she signature and
read it aloud sentence by sentence

joan repeat he word smile feebly and speaking in a
peculiar mechanical way which betray the fact that she be
far away absorbed in she own thought
during the read

the judge that joan be going to sign
the tension among the
spectator be at breaking point

danger whose relief now find expression in a tremendous
joy almost resemble gaiety

she draw a circle explaining as she do so that she be
unable to write
but this be not good enough for erard
so
Loiseleur step forward and guide joans hand enabling she
to write the word follow by a cross
when joan have

joan look up with an expression of fear and surprise
Cauchon continue he read

she turn to the jailer and say with an air of
entreaty

she know that this decision will probably
lead to she death but this she feel strong enough to meet
and now that the first step have be taken she tremble with
impatience
she be weary of the struggle and long to be

silence
only the crackle of the flame and the mumbled
prayer of the priest can be hear
oppress by this
stillness some of the spectator fall on they knee and
other follow they example

but as the priest approach the spectator the latter draw
back of they own accord to avoid contact with they

she scream in she agony
the echo repeat she cry in the sad and silent square
the
bystander pray in chorus while the woman weep and wail
intercede for we
other continue
now and in we last hour
joans coat be already in flame consume by the fire as far
as the knee
she foot be burn
but the executioner continue piling fuel on the bonfire
an
ominous infernal silence prevail
joan scream
jesus
jesus
but the bystander who during these final scene stand as if
paralyze by the fire and by joans cry be seize by a
mood compounded of fear and ecstasy
outburst of anger and
indignation against the oppressor can already be hear
the
english soldier take up a threaten posture
the flame climb steadily high
the noticeboard fasten over joans head go up in flame
and fall into the bonfire
last vision be catch of joans face contorted in terror
she pronounce once more the name of jesus let we she head
slump and give up the ghost
the tumult grow among the
bystander clench fist be raised in the air
threaten word can be hear
then somebody in the crowd
give free expression to what everybody be think and
shout
you have burnt a saint
the cry be taken up until it be hear from every throat
the rope fasten joan to the stake have burnt through and
fall in ash
joans body totter and sink into the
bonfire

at a sign from warwick the soldier pursue the mob out of the
castle yard with thrust of they lance through the gate
and over the drawbridge which be then raised
many fall
victim to the soldier brutality or be trampled to death
the smoke rise in a column conceal joan
on warwicks order the executioner rake through the fire
normally no trace of joan should remain but what be this
joans heart be undamaged
he show it to warwick and pour
oil on the flame but still the heart will not catch fire
he try in vain with the help of sulphur and coal to make
it burn
the flame leap up guide by he expert hand but
when the fire subside again the executioner find the heart
still intact
convinced that he be witnessing a manifest
miracle he look questioningly at warwick who answer
curtly
throw this lot in the seine
in he anguish the executioner fall on he knee before
Ladvenu terrify that he will be condemned for have burnt
a saint
as the sun go down joans heart
be sunk in the river the heart
which from that time become the
heart of france just as she
herself be the incarnation of the
eternal france
