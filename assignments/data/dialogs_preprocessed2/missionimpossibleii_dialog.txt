to disrupt you party any longer

bloody hell do you have in mind

work under adverse condition
highly
adverse condition

sound smashing
i be in
Muchacho mi
carro por favor
now be serious
you
could not possibly want i off tonight
performance

you do not do that badly

you be apologize for i
quite the
gentleman

not really
i trigger the alarm

hey the bulgari job last week be
flawless
and i have always be partial to
pale yellow

i do not do laundry or put up with
cheeky bastard who set i up on they
territory so they can poach on mine

hola

hi
would you mind slow down

where do you get this number
i do not
even have it

would you like it

pull over and listen to i will you
just listen

listen to what

i need you help and i thin you can use
mine

you help
what be you talking about

scotland yard interpol every dutch
authority
i can make they go away

oh bloody hell
you be a spy

i deserved that

slow down slow down

Uhoh

no

oh
oh

do not look down
just
look at i
that be it
that be it

what be you name

ethan hunt

well ethan hunt what be it you want to
talk to i about

more than i think

awfully short notice

care to wait a decent interval

who want to be decent

so what have you get against spook

when they have get you recruit
technique
not a thing

oh
well
this be not exactly by the book

they have get a book for this

they have get a book for everything

the only other spook i know be a liar
charming but absolutely incapable of
telling the truth
he would lie about his
favorite color
but then i reckon it be an
occupational hazard
all spy really do
be conceal the truth and tell lie

not revealing information do not
necessarily make someone a liar

that be not the point
in the end what
spy rely on be the one thing they think
they know that you do not

which be

that they be lying

once they know that they can
get very very
crosee

so where do i get right

you be not a liar
or you be an awfully
good one
this thing these bloke pinched

i do not know that they pinched it
do not even know that they be bloke

well then what i be i do here
i assume
i be mean to be some sort of thiefto
catchathief

so do i
sort of

spoken like a spook
you ever afraid

of what

ask a question you get an answer

damn you be beautiful

that be because i be on i back

i do not think so
crema
Fallas de valencia
on this night great papy

be you going to be here a while

si senor

i will pick up on i way out okay

Fetivals a pain in the ass
Honoring
saint by setting on fire
sit down sit down

let we you know what they think of saint
do not it
damn near set i on fire on
i way over here
as if i have not be
burned enough today

sorry i barge in on you vacation

sorry i do not let you know where i be

do not be
would not be on vacation if you do

well
you be sorry and i be sorry

why do you phrase it like that

like what

you be sorry and i be sorry


you get to be kidding

well dmitri
how be you

i be fine
and you

i be fine

i be fine and you be fine

i be fine too
i be fine and you be fine do
you remember dear fry how you get
sergei and i to repeat those line from dr
strangelove and we give you the name of that
silly soviet premier because we do not know
you name
in those day you not only
saved we live you saved we sanity
now
then dmitri we have this little problem
every search for a hero must begin with
something that every hero require
a
villain
therefore in a search for we
hero bellerophon we created a monster
chimera
i beg you dmitri come to sydney
and accompany i to atlanta immediately
however we travel i must arrive at i
destination within hour of departure
forgive this fanciful explanation but for
now prudence dictate that i communicate
nothing but the grave urgency
i fear i can entrust this to no one but
you dmitri
as we say i be sorry and
you be sorry

let i ask you something
you have any
idea what the hell he be talking about

an idea yeah

like

like it be a good idea to pick he up in a
hurry
and a bad idea to fly he on a
commercial carrier
so let we get on with
it
he be still in sydney

dr
vladimir Nekhorvich be dead
so be his
colleague Gradski but that happen
early
we have Nekhorvich on a flight
from sydney that crashed in the rockies

hunt be you listening

if he do not want to go anywhere without
i how do you get he on the flight

you be there

file open to computer scan

when i could not find you i have to replace
you
sean ambrose be the obvious choice
he double you what
two three time

twice

what do you think of he

you know we have reservation about each
other
be not it a little late in the day
to be asking i that

not necessarily

airline record list captain harold
macintosh as the pilot for flt
as
far as the media and all governmental
agency be concern captain macintosh
die on the flight but in fact he missed
it
he do however make the next flight
in cargo stuffed into a rather small
suitcase considering he size

someone on that flight planned an
operation design to down the plane and
make it look like an accident
someone
skillful enough to bring the whole thing
off without a hitch but they do not
always get you luggage on the plane even
when you fly first class

so there be one thing we know ambrose
do not

then you do think it be ambrose

and you be not surprise

whatever Nekhorvich be carrying sean
wanted and he wanted to conceal the fact
that he take it

enough to kill Nekhorvich and two hundred
innocent passenger

sean feel he have not do the job unless
he leaf a lot of hat on the ground

the question be why
what be this
chimera Nekhorvich be carrying

right now only ambrose know that

in any case you have get to recover chimera
and bring it to we

in order to do that i have get to figure
out how he plan to make money with it

right
in fact since the plane go
down we bank source have confirmed a
mark increase in the stock pilling of
cash in terrorist account

terrorist


well you know Nekhorvichs history
you be the one who get he out of the
soviet union be it still in bio
weapon business

if that be what you be think ambrose
would have set up a bid situation with
any number of buyer before he get on the
plane
locate he in time to stop
something like that

be where miss hall come in

excuse i

miss hall and ambrose have a relationship
which he take very seriously
she walk
away and he be wanting she back ever
since
we believe she be we sure and
quick way of location he

and then what

then make sure she continue to see he
get he confide in she and report to
you

you make it sound as if i be recruiting
she for she skill as a thief

well then i mislead you
or you make the
wrong assumption
either way we be asking
she to resume a prior relationship not do
anything she have not already do

she be get no train for this kind of
thing

go to bed with a man and lie to he
she be a woman
she be get all the train
she need

i do not think i can get she to do it

you mean it will be difficult

very

well it be not mission
difficult
hunt
it be mission
impossible
difficult should
be a walk in the park for you
if you can
think of a quick way to get to ambrose
you be welcome to try
oh by the way you
might want to take a look at these
if you
have any far qualm about get she
to do the job

senor senor
you flower

yes
they be very nice

what be the population of seville any
idea

five sixhundred thousand

there be nearly million in london

and six billion in the world

that be lot of people out there
how many
of they i wonder be capable of
something like that

sean ambrose for one

right

not that it matter much but
i seem to
recall you staying something like i be
hope we could work together


this be not what i have in mind Nyah

but it be what you would like i to do
so tell i to do it

come on out with it
tell i to go and
insinuate myself back into Seans life

go and insinuate yourself back into Seans
life

i would like a little more conviction

so would i
but it be not mine to give

you have either get it or you do not
let
you conscience be you guide

something like that

but i do not have a conscience
i be a
bloody thief

you can be a thief and have a conscience

no
you can be a thief and have a
conscience
not i
why do you have to
tell i about this
what do i have to do to get away from this
guy
when you be with he he mess
about with you head every wake
moment
even now i will be at some outof
thewayplace a tin of caviar and a
bottle of crystal show up at the table
with two glass god know how he find
out at any give moment where i be in the
world but he do
and it look like he be
do it again
you know he definition of
a true paranoid

i do not

someone in possession of all the fact
be you telling i i have to do this

generally i do not favor coerce someone
not when there be a chance i life could
end up in they hand

and that be the only reason

can you think of a good one

not i
i be just hope you might
or
that
somehow in the course of business
this get personal as well as physical

look would it make you feel good if i
do not want you to do this

much

then feel good

well
that make all the difference in the
world do not it

sean will never be anything but suspicious
if he pick up some sort of yoohooI be
notnad message
not after the way we
broke up

what would not make he suspicious

probably that i needed he in some urgent
way
destitute in serious trouble
the
kind i could not possible sort out myself

serious trouble Nyah be something i can
always arrange

this little chip send a coded signal that
can be pick up only by we computer

when it be in you ankle we can track you
within three foot of anywhere in the
world

look i can not run you arrest in but
i guarantee he be monitor every law
enforcement agency in the world for what
they might be saying about he if nothing
else he be get the ability and we
assume the desire to get you out of
there

this do not seem to be accomplish
much

well i mean it be not a total loss
it be
keeping a very capable thief off the
street

very funny
maybe he have hear and
do not want to know
maybe he be lost
interest

you lawyer to see you

what lawyer

well here we go
request immediate availability

stop and look for something in you
purse
kneel down

limo waiting

ambrose will have countersurveillance
second to no one
when and if he
contact you push this button
before you actually end up under he roof
it will scramble you transmission to we

when will you be there

before you be

how can you possibly
i have get to get
right on the plane
i be leaving now

you do not trust i

judge of character

he be get you on qantas flight
it be
going to be delayed

yes

you will be fine
i be going to lose
you

ethan you take care of yourself i will
take care of myself because if push come
to shove i be going to bail and without
giving two week notice

any sudden change in Ambroses plan
especially any involve you

just want to tell you it be an honor and a
pleasure to be working with you bloke
whoaa

it certainly be
how do we get so lucky

be it he then

damn
just when it be about to get
interesting

it be okay
she scrambled the
transmission
luther continue feeding
the she position

can not we speed this up

with what
this be the only computer
that do this

right
now there be a bloke who know
how to deliver a proper welcome
do not
get i wrong mate
you be quite
hospitable
be it he then

it be billy

then we get

we do not know what we have get because we
do not know what he be get where he be get
it or what he be do in sydney with it

not much luggage

i left in a bit of a hurry
i be terribly
grateful sean

on what

how hard you have to work to get i out of

how do you that

magic

ahh

no fly on she
checking she on a scanner
screen

all cat be

therefore in a search for we hero
bellerophon we created a monster
chimera

what you get there mate

myth
just a myth
should not you be
checking out they countersurveillance

well you know he bloke place the
in he annex where else if you be
pinpoint transmitter video signal
covert chip camera anything radiate
oscillating

or hard wired

or hard wired right
first line of
perimeter defence run from the back of
the dock to the front of the house
whatever move burp or bleep be going to be
picked up to a height of twenty foot
basically impenetrable i would say

ethan here Nekhorvich and here he
boss

mccloy jon Chaddick Biocyte
pharmaceutical



september
manchester england

well do you disagree with that

not at all
but how about going into town
and confirming you intuition on site

oh well if that be how you feel about it

then cambridge
harvard
entrepreneurial
effort
in effort
in acquire Biocyte in
hostile takeover

ethan have a look at this

we at out stateoftheart solar power
Biocyte build recognized that eternal
vigilance be the price of health
whether
it be funding the teach center at the
royal prince edward hospital remove
aerosol product from the marker or
brave the influenza quarantine at bruny
island late last month
at Biocyte you
life
be we life work

Biocyte worker at bruny island

think you could use a little something
to wear

try it on

go ahead
i be dying to see if i
remembered you size

no changing room

you be not interest in seeing how it
look

oh i be
later

therefore in a search for we hero
bellerophon we created a monster
chimera

why be Nekhorvich going on about an old greek myth

Nekhorvich specialize in recombine
molecule
in the myth bellerophon killed
chimera a recombinant monster with the head
of a lion and the tail of a serpent who
plague the ancient world
i think Nekhorvich
have created a monster virus in chimera and
apparently the means to kill it in
bellerophon

that simple huh

why not

damn you be beautiful

do you say something

i said you be beautiful Nyah

only because
it be spring
chalk it up
to spring fever

will not do love

nearly autumn

everything
upside down and backwards here

maybe that be it then
Everythings upside
down and backwards

luther

damn you be beautiful

Twentyfour mil

Thirtyseven million pound
that be a
promise bid

we will need this at the track
well then
sort

not everything
why do you think she be
really here

from she point of view or mine

be not exactly gag for it when she
left you six month ago
the question be
do you trust she

one consider she time of course
get nicked within a week of the plane
going down
suggestive even borderline
suspicious but hardly conclusive

well you have thorough about it at any
rate

tell i hugh
you do not exactly hang on
Nyahs every word and gesture do you
fairly ratty nail that

sean

you be not scrutinize any casual shrug
for some hairsplitting nuance be you

sean please

suppose she be some sort of trojan horse
send in by to spy in we why should i
deny myself the pleasure of a ride or two
or do not you think i can learn more from
she than she can from i

i do

now hugh you must realize that some of we
have the burden of sex to deal with
and
i dear chap
i may or may not know why
she think she be here but i be will to
take the risk because hugh i be gaging
for it

no use i friend
the medical staff
want no part of this
doctor do not
fancy the idea of dying any more than
anybody else

how could i
possibly
be infected

that be exactly what Gradski said
hour before he die
with
chimera
the
most minute exposure can be fatal

but then you should not be feeling to i will
not for another three of four hour
anyway

you have bellerophon

do i

you take it
all of it
and what if i need
it

if
i i i
the five hundred
people on bruny island that you
deliberately infected with
chimera
needed
it as well

oh please
how be i to know they have to
be treated with bellerophon within twenty
hour

by asking i

you still do not get it do you
you want
to make an omelet you break a few egg
i needed to know just how bad the disease
be
in the real world not the lab
and
you never know til you try
you think
you be genetically splicing together
strain of influenza to create a
cure for all influenzas
but i see you
create a disease so terrible in
chimera
that the cure would be priceless

you wanted the disease in order to peddle
the cure

well the thought have occur to i
i needed
chimera in order to peddle bellerophon
for
hero to be appreciate you need a monster
now that be not so difficult to understand be
it
look time be a shot of penicillin could
knock off every bloody bug in the zoo
not
anymore
have you any idea the money it
take to float one little pissy boutique
antibiotic that be barely effective against one
strain of one bacterium
if i could not make
money killing the microscopic little shit that
be out there you would help i put one out there
i can make on
there it be
i have
confess
i john
mccloy be in business
to make money
Lillys making billions feeding
prozac to depress dog
pfizer do not even
know where to put the money they be making on
Viagra and let i tell you that shit do not do
a thing for i even at twice the recommend
dose jesus who do i have to screw to get a
a break
now get i out of here get i treated
and let we go back to work

you know i think it be a little late for
that
do give i regards to Gradski if
you see he

ethan you know what frighten i most
when i be with he
the thought of never
seeing you
how be we get out of here

Nyah it be very important not do
anything to alarm ambrose

what
you told i to get out of here
i
think you be here to collect i
i
be so relieve

no time to explain
you have do well
and we be so close
so close
it be
critical that you do whatever ambrose
ask
do not worry it will be over soon
that be a promise
come on now off you
go

so ambrose have bellerophon and mccloys
get chimera

there guy be walking around with
different halve of the same dollar bill

ambrose get bellerophon from Nekhorvich
on the plane but he do not get the chimera
virus

yeah
why else would he come back to
australia
if he have they both he could
sell they anywhere

i kill chimera at Biocyte and he be sitting
on a cure without a disease

you have get the voice print i will get we in

you be right
hunt sting mccloy
tonight
he know
they will be going into
Biocyte

good
then we go where he will be do not
we
well do hugh
well do

you be home guv
home

where be george
i regular driver
where be he

take i will guv
touch of the flu
they
say it be going around
nasty business
mind you do not catch a chill now

luther do you have the build up and
run

that be not exactly it

sorry that it a Biocyte facility they
storage structure

Nyah still on the property

she have not left it

okay here you go

let we start from the inside out

all storage and production of chimera be
do here in this lab on the fortysecond
floor the heart of the build

chimera itself be keep in two place
in
production vial in an incubation room and
house in a small airtight chamber inside
three injection gun

mate you kill it in both place we be
laughin and we go home

now how to get in there

no garage entrance
Lobbys protected by
five guard on rotate patrol

if you look at hunt operational history he
invariably favor misdirection and deception
for a start he will not go into Biocyte from the
ground where he have to risk confrontation
with security

not going in from the ground
show i the
atrium

the atrium
one of a kind
run down the
center of the build
provide hour
natural light via mirror and daylight
storage cell
optimal grow condition
for the virus
end in a glass floor which
double as part of the lab ceiling

hey atrium roof close at sundown

and if the louvers be open for more than
thirty second at night the civil
emergency alarm be tip
those even i
can not stop
thirty second total to get
you in and the cable out

security

Thirtysecond open in the roof and a
foot drop

i be not waiting hour
when we be do
at Biocyte if she be not out of Ambroses
i be going in and get she out

no hunt will prefer to engage in some
sort of acrobatic insanity to enter
Biocyte somewhere through the atrium where
security be minimal

package away in five
four
three
two
one

i be not ready

i be go

mon
mon
mon

nineteen
eighteen
seventeen

sixteen
fifteen

luther i be looking at security

oh
uh
commence diversion
alarm in cosmetic

get to get that cable out

there it go


what be the matter with you
can not you
hear the alarm go off in cosmetic

right
then i guess i will have to trot off
to see who be pinch eyeliner will not i
i will even check the stairwell on the way

retract cable

three
two
one

cable clear

transponder activate
reading package and
cable be clean
he be on he way

he will make the attempt at the only possible time
for both of we

when the guard rotate
and the building airfiltration generator go
active covering the sound of he breakin

ethan the generator be about to go active
we will be out of contact for eleven minute

the frequency of the generator operate to
we advantage cutting radio
communication from he team for the next
eleven minute

what be this then
reinforcement

not exactly mate

billy
i think we get a problem
Nyahs
on the wing
up early
billy do you
copy

exactly where be she

in the build

say again
sound like you be saying
she be in the build


i be
she be

ethan do it the hard way to avoid
confrontation
neutralize security
guard be simply too distasteful to he

i have never find that a problem

right
well then
she be not likely to
be alone
be she

the question be how many of they
i
can not get thru to ethan
not til the
generator go off

when be that

not for another eight and a half minute


ethan pull on a protective mask from he pack and put a

john
mccloy

it look like Nyahs headed toward an
elevator

if hunt actually manage to squeak thru
the atrium he be liable to make it to
chimera before we will

she be in the elevator heading toward ethan

how much long before you can reach he

five and a half minute
he be breached the hot zone

on the other hand we know where hunt will
be and he do not know we be coming

how be we do then

he should have have killed the virus in the

Nyahs exited the

what can we do mate

hope he kill all the bug before the
yellow dot get to the red one

subject be contaminate free
zero contaminate
factor
subject contaminate free

he be still get three injection gun in the
test lab
they be loaded with dose of
chimera which he will destroy by fire
into a hyperthermal chamber

twentyseven twentysix twentyfive
come on ethan we be almost there
am
off sensitive for this

eighteen second the generator be
off and Ethans back on line

oh oh oh

get it

those be two explosion you van and
you safehouse in case you do not hear
they both i believe that means you have
also lost a friend

and you could not walk to tell i about it

hold you fire dammit

well hunt
Howve you be

fight a bit of a cold

and you be happy about that

beat fighting the flu i be here to tell
you

you know that be the hard part of
have to portray you
grin like an
idiot every fifteen minute

i would have think the hard part be
exercise restraint
curbing that
press need of you to get you gun
off
you be in such a hurry to knock
off that you never figure out where
the virus really be

i know where it be

oh
then you know the only way
could smuggle the live virus to the
scientist in atlanta be by inject
himself and use he own bloodstream as a
petri dish do it inside of twenty
hour so he could take the antivirus and
still have it be effective
you know that
while you be knocking he off and
destroy the very thing you come for

stop
put a sock in it
hit that bloody
gun and you will spray the bloody virus all
over the place

there it be guy the last of it

yep
you have provide we with a golden
opportunity to have both the bug and the
bug killer

what be the top bid

why you going to make i a good offer

than thirtyseven million pound
not
really

Somebodys be slipping you we mail
come on out here you bad girl

she do not belong here sean
let she go

she would not be here if it be not for
you hunt
from this moment you be
responsible for what happen to she and
if you be looking out for she wellbeing
i suggest you advise she to pick up the
gun and bring it to i
ball in you
court hunt
what have you get to say
Nyahs waiting for you answer

ethan Nyahs in the build
do you
copy

thank you

sure he will not shoot you the minute he be
get it

oh hunt please
one can not hold Nyah
responsible for she action

in other word you be calling she a
flake

you know woman mate
like monkey they
be
will not let go of one branch til
they have get a grip on the next
get it
Nyah
i will cover you

i be waiting

not much more than body
length from ethan
this be not exactly working out the way you
think it would ethan
sorry

you
bitch

you be not going to shoot sean
not
this bitch
she be worth thirtyseven
million pound

what do you think you be do

i be not think
just
trying to keep
you from get hurt that be all

you who do not have a conscience

something of surprise to
she
i guess i lie
you can not get both of we
out of here can you

no

then you will have to kill i before it be
too late
before i start killing people

no

i be infected with chimera
you know you
do not have a choice
just do it now

for god sake get it over with

we have get hour and minute before
you start killing anybody
i will get
bellerophon into you system by then
just stay alive
i be not going to lose you

dream of bird and fly fox
bushfire dream wind dream
oddly appropriate

since it appear that chimera the
mother of all nightmare be on the loose
somewhere around here be there any way
this disaster can be view as a qualify
one

not yet
we do manage to pull any
sensitive equipment and material out of
we safehouse wreckage

we could lock down passport control and
all port of authority but that will not
stop ambrose and beyond he we do not
know who else we be looking for all
terrorist bank account of which we be
aware be stable
no deposit no
withdrawal
therefore no suspect

we think we have get we finger on the
buyer

do you
even assuming you be able to
prevent ambrose selling chimera you have
now get an additional problem
you
destroyed all of chimera at Biocyte
if
ambrose be going to sell chimera now
he will have to do it by taking a pint or so
of miss hall blood to market

yes i believe that be right

but that leaf another seven or eight
pint of chimera

you mean that leave miss hall

yes i believe that be right
now i
understand be that hour after
exposure the victim become infectious
highly infectious

you noted the time of exposure

good
then if you manage to get hold of
ambrose and obtain what he be get you have
get
hour minute and twentythree
second to destroy the large remain
source of chimera on earth

she sacrifice herself

brave girl
if you can get hold of
bellerophon with the time limit you may
spare she the ultimate sacrifice
but in
either case you have get less than nine
hour to kill she or cure she
after that
it be out of we hand and a matter of
worldwide material law
and hunt
however
you obtain it we want you to preserve a
sample of chimera
bring it back alive

something else

be not you even curious
about why she
do it

no
i can not afford to be curious
and
neither can you hunt

feel like plead for you life

not as much as you feel like hearing it

god damn it Nyah
why do you do it
why
do you save that bastard

if it will make you feel any good i will not
do it again

if it will make you feel any good you be
going to take a lot of aussie with you
and make i a lot of money

what be you talking about

in just a few hour you can be assure of
going down in history as the typhoid mary
of oz
day

luther
luther

ethan i keep telling you there be not a
chance of locate Nyah til i access the
satellite and there be not a chance of
do that til i get this thing boot up
and running
how much time do she have left

Ninetyseven minute twentyseven
second

before we kill she or cure she

right

wrong
all we have get to worry about be
ambrose
Nyah will take care of Nyah

what be you talking about

unless we dose she with bellerophon on the
next ninetyseven minute Nyah will kill
herself
so first thing first
Swanbeck said there be no cash movement
from any monitor terrorist account

confirm what ambrose be going to do

who he be do it with and where he be
going to do it

Ethans out from under the bridge and on
the southeast face

ethan ambrose and he tem have
over the bridge

copy that

you all right mate
from here it look
like very security
what be it look like
like from there

risky

breached the structure at the ten of the clock
grating
in the tunnel moving toward the
target

it be a match
the blood loaded with
chimera
bellerophen
destroy
chimera

and they certainly have bellerophen

well then
you have get both the virus and
the antivirus
chimera
and
bellerophen
which mean i have thirty million for
you

that be all the cash i can come up with

not exactly
wallis

more like twotwo point two million

in any case we do not want you cash

then what do you want

stock mr
mccloy
stock option to be a
little more precise
cut she loose
right in the center of
town
the more crowd the good
how quickly can you manufacture more of
the antivirus

ethan just picked up an ambrose call
Nyahs be drop off
i think she be

where

in downtown sydney for a start

you create the supply mr
mccloy we have
just created the demand
three million
people in sydney and million people in
australia be going to need bellerophen
within a matter of day
not to mention
the rest of the world

now here the way it be going to
work
wallis the share outstanding be

Ninetythree point four million

which mean mr
mccloy we have to get
we hand on four hundred and eighty
thousand option
we will borrow you
thirty million to buy those option
you
stock never sell above thirtyone
dollar a share
we will agree to buy at
fifty

when you stock go north of two hundred
and it will those option will be worth
billions
we can borrow whatever we need

sorry ethan
i do not quite know where to
begin
any suggestion

you would like i to conduct i own
debrief

why not
you have do just about
everything else on this operation

i would thank you but i be not sure that be
a compliment

of course it be
anyone whose operation
require the level of disinformation that
yours do be bound to get a little flak
here and there
you try flogging the
story on i have have to come up with
about what be be going on around here the
last few day
at any rate it be be
most instructive what they will swallow
or what they will broadcast with a straight
face
miss hall blood it appear have
absolutely no element of the chimera
virus
not even antibody

yes i gathered as much

and the only other remain sample be in
the canister you recover from ambrose

yes

and that appear to have be destroyed
it also contained the antivirus
bellerophon

well bellerophon it turn out be only
really effective against chimera

but you be under specific instruction
to bring back a live sample of the
chimera virus
i would be very interest to
know how after you would manage it recovery
intact it subsequently get destroyed

by fire
that be the good way really

so you do not fail mission you simply
changed it

it be no longer enough for you to execute
and implement policy you now wish to
go in the business of create it

no i do not
but in this case

in this case it be not a bad idea
in
face it be a pretty damn good idea
just do not make a habit of it
and as for
ms
hall in light of she effort she
criminal record will certainly be
expunge
i be assuming you approve

i do

where be she now by the way
do you
know

i do not
no exactly

well hunt what be you plan

not sure
some sort of vacation
i will
let you know where i be going

oh you do not have to do that
would not
be a vacation if you do

this incident in the wake of rumor
suddenly surface about mr
mccloy and
Biocytes financial difficulty
including criminal allegation of insider
trade embezzlement conspiracy to
commit fraud and stock park have
understandably send stock price of the
pharmaceutical company plummeting

so what do he say

good job
and thank

that be it
that be it
that be it

and the check in the mall

right
just remember mate
billy
bairds the name
anything you need to
get move or watch i be you man

always nice hear from you man
stay in
touch

let we get lost
