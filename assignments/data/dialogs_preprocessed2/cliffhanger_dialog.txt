stay there

be ready

right away mr
travers

good good
i will be right down



you can not go in there



watch i

walter wright

we need to talk

we will be fuel and ready in ten
minute mr
travers

go ahead and take ten
we will need the
time

matheson


you parent must be proud
what the fuck be this about

small problem with the shipment
travers
tell he what you just told i

we get word that somebody be
observe you currency shipment
this load the s over the
last three delivery

there be not a hell of a lot anyone can
do but observe
this be the most protect shipment
we have get and the most useless for
a thief
those bill be not in
circulation
you think five thousand
dollar bill be easy to pass
who the
fuck would try

this guy might

who be he

he name eric Qualen
one of the
east german spy who get shut out by
the reunification
the issued an
interagency warn about he right
after the wall come down
he be get
nowhere to go and nothing to lose
he be also get the international
connection to get rid of bill like
these and he be probably desperate
enough to try for they
fifty million
buck buy a lot of sanctuary

could you get to the part where i be
suppose to care

we have two agent monitor he
these two gleason and quinones
they last report said he be going to
try to take this shipment

thanks for the tip
but i have get work
to do

do i say last report
i think i
do
i mean last fuck report
these guy have vanished

you have i sympathy but
there be a reason we do thing this
way all right
armored car can be
hijack
train can be derail
but
nobody can get to we in flight
the
only time this be on the ground be at
the mint or on the presidio runway in
san francisco
either way someone
would have to shoot he way past a
couple of thousand guard

if you be worry about an inside job
forget it
i checked the plane from
top to bottom an hour ago
and these
three be i good against
even if one
of they do go skydive they
would not get far
each case have an
electronic tracer with a range of one
hundred mile

i have not lost a bill in eight year
and i be not scrubbing this shipment
because you scare easily

who said anything about stopping the
shipment
i have be tracking Qualen for almost a
year
if he pull something i want to
be in on the party

this be clear from the top traver
matheson will accompany you on the
flight to san francisco
show he every professional courtesy


rescue one to base over



rescue one have you sight they
over

negative hal storm already
moving in i can not see they and
wind be too strong to stay up
here over



rescue one abort
they will be all
right
brett and evan be dumb enough
not to log in but they be smart
enough to have storm gear
head back
to base
maybe you can catch gabe before he
leave
over

i do not think he be planning a long
visit hal
rescue one heading back to base over
and out

way to check the weather brett

hey
if it be easy it would not be
worth ddoing


just enjoy the view huh
relax
i mean what could happen in
the air

stay put
do not panic goddammit

he be coming in too slow

no we be going too fast and we be
too high up
push flap forward twenty
degree and drop to five thousand
foot

you get any rifle

forward compartment leave side

what the hell be you do

checked the plane from top to bottom
huh
you fucker
put you hand behind you head
it be
over

calm down give the gun to i

there be a couple of dead body in the
front compartment they be
agent

he be losing it

goddamn it
do not you see what he be
do
he be hijack the fuck
shipment
do not make i shoot you

do not make i laugh

move into position



more more keep it coming

lock on
move into lateral position

moving into lateral position

we be right on the edge of the
storm let we move it

this be not going to work wright
will suspect something

so what
he will sift though a plane
that go down in a storm
find enough pulverized bone for six
man heroically killed in the line of
duty
and just enough of the right kind
of ash

we get twentyone gun funeral and
they write off fifty million
it be
perfect as long as you hold the plane
steady so concentrate

travers hurry it up

on i way

that charge be going to blow both
engine the plane go down like a
rock so clip yourself on to the end
of the cable with the money as soon as
i get over
and make sure you bring the right
case

dip the plane
i be coming over

why do not you send the money over

somehow i do not think you would have
wait for i if i would send it first

get underneath the jet
the case will
slide over

low
get underneath it

it be drag we down
disconnect the
cable

so much for phase one
