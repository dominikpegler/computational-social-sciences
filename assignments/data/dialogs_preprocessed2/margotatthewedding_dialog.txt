he be tested very well
he do bs
in school
claude stop he mother and toby be argue out the
window
she eye meet his for a second they make no
connection she go back to toby

but that be how autism work

he be
exactly what you would imagine except i
think he be clinically depress


not ugly but completely
unattractive
and he have no job
the good i can make out be that
he be a letter writer
i do not
know the house look weird to
i
she be trying too hard and it be
kind of a mess
they take down the

smear some eye makeup off of she face

be you have fun

you do not notice
anything different about pauline

no


she be pregnant she told i
but
she be keeping it a secret i mean
from malcolm and even ingrid
which i think be unforgiveable
now she will have to marry he
what be she planning to get
marry and not drink champagne
then she will just be lying
i guess
she be afraid she will miscarry
she
probably will
i think on some
level she be ambivalent about the
marriage and that be why she be not
telling he

be you stone mom

maybe a little

i do not like it



i scrotum be long than i penis

it be sweet how claude look up to

figure out if i should agree with
you or not

dessert

malcolm let it go
margot would insist on driving if
she know how

i license elapse
but i know
how

it be probably for the good
i have
this theory i think historically
woman have be hold back in so
many way that when they get power
like they do behind the wheel they
can not help but abuse it
it be akin
to hannah Arendts eichmann theory
about prison guard and prisoner
switching roll

that be a charming philosophy


yeah
tell that one a lot

this be not a blanket thing
i
mean woman can be great driver
too
he take a long satisfy drag on he cigarette

say the man with the moustache
that he think he be wearing in
quote

or mine
malcolm pump the brake

point and there be no warn

she would used some thing of ours
then the new yorker come we
have a subscription and there be
the story and
it be thing we
said and do stuff i told she in
confidence


i think it helped end we marriage
i read it and think she hate
i


she do not hate you

you think
margot tried to murder
i when we be girl
she put i
on a bake sheet sprinkle i

oven



jim be here

be jim still writing

the guy pointing at we




i be very interest in you story
middle child


the father be a loathsome character
yet we also feel a strange sympathy
for he

yeah well i be very interest in
exploring a fatherdaughter
relationship
while he cling
desperately to she suffocate she
really he also silently resent
the responsibility of parenthood

there be this sexualize pushpull
with daphne which i find

he crave isolation really
i
always thought of he as someone
who so over identify with
everyone around he that he begin
to lose all sense of himself

you make he only recourse to
abandon he family including his
beloved daughter

right that be true
that be true

i write historical fiction so i
do not have to answer to this but i
wonder for someone who write so
nakedly about family how
autobiographical be this portrait


i father be a love person
he
have he day of course but
he
be devote to we as child
i
would not have written this portrait
be it true
pauline nod slightly

but i be interest in how the
father could be in fact a portrait
of you
margot stare dumbstruck

it be base on
we all take from
life
i have to have we

be puerto rican send over
by
whirlpool i think it be who
make we fridge
although he said

organization who whirlpool
subcontract
i think he be
retard
there be an anger in
he and suddenly i become afraid
for i life

pauline take claudes hand and press it to she chest
he
eye widen fix on he mother
