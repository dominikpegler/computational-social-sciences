mundane fantasy of model in they pantyhose and underwear

equally small mirror a bible and plastic glowinthedark madonna and child and various
religious print and plaster quotation on the wall

madison avenue mind
and then with that extra sense of perception apparatus that fear it be
about to be catch do something it should not carrie glance out the window and down to
see

as this formidable vision of black stride down the walk
another woman like this would be
coming home from a funeral

now encase in the body of an adolescent
as she hear margaret close the front door and call out she name as she hang up she coat

where we get a sense of exactly what chris mean by favor as de lois Trennant and a once
again completely wrecked kenny garson plus norma bring over more ballot
it be not
exactly what one would call an honest ballot

as sue manage to slip by fromm who be still lazily monitor the door
she start heading
for the backstage area trying to be as unobtrusive as possible

at the voting table she spy sue coming in and finding it irresistible blurt out the news
whispering to

silence
everything a halfbeat exaggerated slow
carrie gasp inwardly
the candle in front of she blow out
tommy grin amuse
he shrug he shoulder at carrie
and the applause begin some of it most of it genuine but some of it mocking too
the band launch into a rock version of pomp and circumstance

usher appear at tommy and carry table
george be pounding Tommys back
an
aluminum foil scepter be thrust into Tommys hand
a robe with a fur collar be thrust over
carry shoulder

peer out farther to get a good look
unseen at first by she there be a cord on the edge of the


block by the clamor of the student he be unable to make a straight beeline for sue in the
wing
so he take the long way around back behind the stage

Dollying as they be lead down the center aisle

in the corner of the the cord we glimpse early
the same one which chris clutch beneath the stage jiggle and sue notice it move
she trace it path with she eye seeing that it go up to

conceal a single silver bucket
meanwhile

the light be searing so hot and bright that it be impossible to
see clearly and a new set of spotlight be shine on tommy and she only make it hard

as a piece of crepe paper land in she hair

sea of face the spectrum of reaction

spreading he arm

the window so they can escape
morton have grab a chair and be trying to smash it through another of the window
all this
to no avail
end


as she make she way down the stage stairs and out onto the floor
she spot the cord going
under the stage first and realize just how the trick be engineered
that billy and chris do
it

moving aside as carrie walk through they an endless series of blur hysterical face

as carrie make it to one set of double door flex they open and exit


as carrie exit the door swinging shut
behind she through the window we see a wall of
fire collapse behind she
she pass sue in the hall who be sob hysterically
and as carrie exit sue run into this
inferno of fire to find tommy
and then the town
and
it
overlap onto



carry on she way home
at this point she look less like a girl that the survivor of a grisly
car accident
wet cake with blood eye glistening madly almost shapeless
she go down
a hill and then from

as a fire truck rush toward the school past carrie
and then shortly afterward out of
nowhere Billys chevy it be headlight gleam lurch forward

billy be livid turning around to see carrie in the back window

Goddamnit

billy realize this and start pumping the brake
but the care accelerating not respond to Billys effort to slow it down

she head pound flex


as billy attempt to turn the wheel
it too have turn traitor it will not turn
they be heading right for the embankment
Billys eye be bug out chris be screaming
as

plow smack into the embankment and roll over several time
it then burst into a sheet of
flame


watch this explosion turn into a conflagration
we see the fire reflected in she puffy
exhaust face bright and bright as we the sound of the merging with
and


the house be totally dark
not even a porch light
in the distance perhaps the glow from the
burn gymnasium
figure be moving toward the house
it be carrie

carrie try the front door
it be unlock
she open it partially

momma
momma
she open the door wide

carrie close the front door


with the close of the door carrie turn on a light
she look around
the house be
ominously empty ominously still



silence flood back in
carrie move to the foot of the stairs turning on light as she go
she mount the stairs
go along the narrow hallway to she room


carrie turn on the light close the door
she stare at the Madonnachild figurine on the bureau
then slowly she remove she bloodstained clthe letting it lie in a heap
clutch a robe she go into the bathroom


carrie turn on the shower wait for it to get hot
it be almost steaming as she step in
very carefully carrie scrub herself clean
then she step out of the shower dry herself off briefly put on she robe and turn off the
bathroom light
what be important here be this give we time to breathe to focus on carrie


carrie return to she room
she be clean now
she wet hair hang
feel of despair about
she or perhaps she be empty out
carrie almost mouth

momma
it be a little childes voice and there be no answer
she go out into the hallway


carrie go to the head of the stairs
once again she mouth the word

an instinct
make she turn

she fling out she arm and cry out

and throw herself against she mother hold she
movement from margaret a quick
movement hard to define
and carrie recoil she hand clutch she stomach
briefly we see the knife in margarets hand
then carrie tumble down the stairs

on carrie lying like a break doll huddle at the foot of the stairs

carry the knife she stare down the stairs

it say in the lords book

dazed she see she mother coming dimly everything distort
she begin to crawl
backwards she eye always on she mother who be slowly but inexorably coming down the
stairs

and now the devil have come home


momma it be not right

carrie crawl far and far from the door until she reach the far end of the kitchen
just as margaret the knife gleam in she hand pointed toward carrie reach the bottom of
the stairs and turn toward the kitchen mumble all the while
carrie flex
the kitchen door swing shut
margaret be coming toward the kitchen
carrie flex again to hold the door shut
but it be no use margaret be relentless now and the door open
she raise the knife and
start toward carrie the door swinging behind she

carrie flex and a serve fork dangle from a hook on
the way suddenly hurtle through the air piercing margaret
it be follow by another and
another as a rain of instrument strike margaret
margaret collapse
carrie horrify by what she be do start toward she mother
and then she and we see sue standing in the doorway clasp she hand to she mouth stifle
she scream

we be just trying to

get out
and then something hit the roof rattling
small sound
stone

the stone be beginning to rain on the roof like hail
sue be rooted to the spot terrify

get out get out get out
the stone be coming down harder
all sound as one or two of they break through the roof
rattle on the floor below


stone of fairly small size crash through into the kitchen
carrie flex
and sue stumble backwards toward the door
flex
sue be whip around as though by a great wind



stone be crashing on the house
sue be hurtle out of the house
as a couple of large stone crash into the room carrie head for the closet
sue rising from the ground see stone crashing into the house
she begin to run away
carrie walk toward the closet
the figure of jesus be illuminated welcoming she
she go
into the closet
she close the door
stone crash down obliterate the scene
sue stop running
she turn to look at the white house
the stone be flatten the house
the house be be pound into the ground
terror and disbelief
nightmare
the rain of stone stop
silence
then the house begin to sink slowly slowly slowly into the ground

and the ground be swallow up the house
and covering it until nothing remains
not a trace



some time later a week perhaps two week after the nightmare of prom night


home in the course of losing it family
white sheet cover furniture
box in the midst of
be packed
eleanor snell looking incredibly tire be attending to the lastminute detail of moving
she
sort through magazine and book discard some putting other into carton
and she
come across the religious tract left behind by margaret white forgotten until now
they
have a momentary hypnotic effect on she
the phone startle she
she rush to answer it in the kitchen catching it on the first
or second ring

hello
oh thank god it be you betty
i do not think i could have
handle one more reporter
just a sec dear
sue
sue
sorry betty i just wanted to make sure the phone do not wake she
we be all a bit edgy
well
sleeping too much i guess but schneider say that be to be
expected after what she be go through
he say she be young enough
to forget it in time
knock wood
as eleanors side of the conversation continue the camera convey she tension
half of she
be listening and talking to betty
the rest of she mind be on sue upstairs
with good reason
because



where the horan house used to stand now vacant
strew with beer can overgrow with
grass and weed and wildflower
and a sign
we over next door where the white house used to stand
it too be vacant but utterly
bald there be be no time for anything to grow here
there be another sign put
up by bear realty

looking utterly haggard and perhaps a bit on the loony side from a lack of sleep stand stare
at the lot
she be standing there in she white nightgown barefoot

as she slowly walk toward it
underwater almost float
we come closer on the sign
which now start appear a bit od less like a simple sign and more like a
grave marker
and when we get close enough we see that some graffiti have be hastily scrawl in chalk
on the sign

and below it in a second vandal handwriting some idiot notion of one final joke


as she kneel down putting the wreath she be carrying next to the marker
she proceed to try
to wipe off the red chalk with the palm of she hand
it smudge badly
she stare at she hand fixate on it remembering carrie in the shower
suddenly a second
hand thrust into frame onto she nightgown
bloody hand
hand from the earth itself
carry hand
it clutch a horrify sue by the wrist
tightly
vice

sue begin screaming uncontrollably
the hand be trying to pull she into the ground
she
scream turn into howling


still screaming
but now in she room waking from what be indeed a bad nightmare
upright in bed screaming she head off she face covered with perspiration
eleanor snell rush into the room to the bed embrace she hysterical daughter

it be all right it be all right darling

mother
and we come in close on sues stricken face as she mother hold she calming she cradle
she
closer still on sues eye
she close they and we go to
