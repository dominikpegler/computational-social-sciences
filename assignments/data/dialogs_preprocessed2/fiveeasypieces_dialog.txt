robert

what

it be still nearly impossible for i
to turn i neck
if i wanted to
turn toward catherine for
instance i would first have to twist
the whole base of i body around
like this

i would not mind do a little
work if you be finished and not
too tire

he sitting there like a stone

week or two be not going to ruin
you life for Godsakes

i can spend some time with you and
ask you some question

enjoy all these
strange thing
you have be do

just curious about it
do you think i be a freak

sort of

oh no
why
what be it
the way i
look

no i do not really think you be a
freak

i probably be but i do not care
i
mean i be not that blessed to
begin with and when would i have
have time to make any
improvement

what about carl and catherine
be
he just coaching she or what

constantly
night and day
and
unless i get up before the bird i
can not get in any practice time for
myself

Uhm hmm

actually it be very admirable the
way she work
she will probably be
enormously successful because
she be attractive as well not that
that be so important in music
but

you be attractive tita
if you
just do a little more with
yourself

like what

well if you just maybe do
something with you hair or

oh let we not talk about i hair
it do what it want to and
anyway who care i want to talk
about you

there be nothing to say tita

well you be not going to run out
on i right away be you

i do not know

oh god do not sneak up on i like
that

sorry

hello

i guess you fell in the water

yes intentionally

that be dangerous you know

swim

play piano all day and then
jumping into cold water
you could
get a cramp

i love to swim and i do not mind
the cold at all
it be invigorating

well i would not want to get too
invigorate myself

why

what would i do with it
run amok

besides piano and swim what
else do you do

well there be fish and boat
there be concert on the mainland
and
but i feel silly telling
you
this be really you home
you
probably know good than i what
there be to do

nothing

nothing
then it must be very
bore for you here

that be right
have you anything to
suggest

i do not know
let i give it some
thought

what be you do right now

right now i be going to run a hot
tub and soak myself

then after that

after that i plan to read some
music and rest for awhile

but the day after be kind of open

carl have hydrotherapy on tuesday

the day after tomorrow

if you be free

yeah i will probably be free

do not laugh

what be wrong carl you hardly eat
anything

i take some aspirin and it really
upset i stomach

one thing that be hard to understand
be how you could have this
incredible background in music and
then just walk away from it
without a second thought

i give it a second thought

he look tire to i spicer
i
think you should put he to bed

i mean how could you not play
anymore
that be so strange to i

i have play a few time
here and
there
as a matter of fact i be
once a rehearsal pianist for a las
vegas musical revue

you do not call that music though

of course i do
it be music
you
know

robert do you mind

what

nothing
will you excuse we for a
while

we really do not have to carl if
you be not feeling good

well maybe if we put the
Thermaphore on i for a while
first

carl

what do you mean
aside from i
neck i be in superb shape

i do not know there be something
wrong with the way you move

i be not aware of it
like what

you serve
two eighteen

i would hate to see you walk across a
concert stage like that

two nineteen

i have walk across a stage a number
of time without exciting any
particular response

that be what i mean

any particular humor i mean

i think you should get someone to
coach you how to walk
i think it be
a substantial problem

dammit

look at that

why be you be so mean

i be not
he do walk funny
do not
you see that

i do not think i would notice
i be so
used to carl

wanting to go on about
it
yeah well he be

bobby
do you think spicer be
attractive

i think he be get a terrific
personality

you know he be formerly a sailor

look can not you see that what i be
talking about

sailor be sadistic i feel

see
there be nothing wrong with the
way i walk
now where be we

at game carl

that be three game to none carl

all right let we have a rematch

i think you have to go to the
mainland today

i be really very moved by the way
you

be that funny

it be not suppose to be it just
strike i that way

why

nothing
it be just that
i picked
the easy piece i could remember
i think i first play it when i
be year old and i play it
well then

it do not matter
it be the
feeling i be affected by

i do not have any

you have no inner feel

none

then i must have be supplying it

wait

well at least you be accomplished
at something

what

at be a fake

catherine

no you be very good at it
i be
really impress

shit

you think i be a fake

i think it be what you think

no it be not what i think

look
you make a very calculated
move and then make i feel
embarrass for respond to you
that be not necessary

yes it be
you have make it clear
that if i can cut a little piano i
might get a little response

i do not think that be accurate

up to now what i have be get
from you be meaningful look over
the dinner table and a lot of vague
suggestion about the day after
tomorrow

i be not conscious of have given
you any meaningful look
and as
for the day after tomorrow this be
the day after tomorrow and i be
unfortunately seeing you
now if
you will excuse i i would like to take
a bath

it be convenient to fake looking for
something right now be not it

i be not fake anything
i be
looking for some bath oil

some bath oil

what about this one
or this one
how about some jasmine
what about some musk

what be you do

knocking the bottle
over
what be you do screw around
with this crap

i do not find you language that
charming

it be direct anyway which seem to
be difficult for you

i would like you to leave now
be that
direct enough

you be not a serious person by
you own admission
and that may be
interesting but it do not
interest i

serious that be what be important to
you

yes that be what be important to
i

okay let we be serious

no do not do that

shut up

no inner feel

that be right

i do not believe vou

i married he when i be
he be
a cellist and i think he be the
most brilliant man i would ever meet
and i be sure he be because at
that age i have not meet that many
but he be insidious you know
he
have i convinced that i be a
mediocrity musically as a woman
as an intellect
but in this
completely imperceptible pleasant
way so that you be not even sure
he be do it
anyway i just
wake up one morning and i said you
know something joseph you be full
of bean and i left he

that be what you said

something witty and devastate
like that

as a matter of fact he be the one
who introduce i to carl
a pause then

how be you

i be fine

carl restored i confidence
he
really do
he be much more
substantial than you give he
credit for

be he

yes

do you think you could discreetly
move across the hall now

yeah i think i could

robert

you certainly do have a beautiful
piece a real estate out here mr
dupea

understand but then it go an

swing
be there any ketchup around

oh for chrissake

robert let we not be rude okay

it be all right
he do not mean

i do not huh

i guess Bobbys just about the
moodiest man i ever ben with

where be you going

i be going to pick up some friend
of Carls
be you all right

i have to talk to you

i will be back later

no i want to talk to you now
i
have to explain something about

no you do not have to it be not
necessary

yes it be

come on get moving dammit

will you shut up for a minute
pull you car out of line

no i can not

will you let i talk to you
please

i can not do that
i have not be
be fair to carl
i have to tell
you that

oh
you have to tell i that

what
i can not hear you

i be sorry everything be so
confuse but i have to go
robert

catherine

please i will see you later this
evening

but the point be man be born into
the world with a preexistent
adversary both real and imaginary
so you would have to say that
aggression be one of he primary
psychic inheritance which

if i may beg to differ

beg all you like john but the
fact remains that man take
enormous delight in aggressive
act as well as the portrayal of
aggressive act and to be
triumphant over another no matter
how seem fundamental to his
have a sense of well be as
well as

no i do not quarrel with you
inference but you draw too long a
bow in you conclusion which seem
unnecessarily harsh and

well i do not make poetry
as an
analyst i

be there a in the house

john believe in the basic goodness
of man and that be fine but gaze
into the pit like i have and that
view seem a little soporific
and
not unlike television it hardly
represent the real world

there be some good thing on it
though

pardon i

the
there be some good thing on
it sometimes

i strongly doubt it but i be not
really discuss media

if you really hold such bleak
view how can you in good
conscience carry on a practice

oh there be always hope i think
for a few individual if they be
courageous enough to she would they
illusion and they

and what about love

what about it
would not you agree
that a great deal of mischief have
be do in the name of love

no i would not

well you be a romantic catherine
as be most musician and what be
more about to be marry

which should exclude you from
any objective discussion
but keep
in mind even the art be not free
of aggressive content nor the
institution of marriage

i think these cold objective
discussion be aggressive
samia

but i would like to say so that i
do not dampen the spirit of you
adventure

you have not dampen i spirit
samia
excuse i

well i should hope not

because obviously there be lofty
class of people that do establish
a kind of relate that be
relatively free of
etc


what kind of doggy be that

it be a borzoi

oh uh huh
i have a little kittycat
once that bobby give i

remember bobby
the little
pussycat you give i

she have four little white paw an
oh be i crazy over she
we hadda
go an leave she one time at some
friend an she go out an get
smashed flatter a tortilla right
outside they mobile home

there
you see what i mean

the choice of word squashed
flat juxtapose against the image
of a fluffy kitten

well she be

perhaps

but you see how close that be to
what i be trying to

do not sit there pointing at she

i beg you pardon

i said do not point at she like
that
what give you the right to
sit there and tell anybody about
class and who the hello get it
and what she typify
you
should not even be in the same room
with she you creep

carl this be really too much

just give i a chance will you

i be trying to be delicate with you
but you be not understanding i
it be not just because of carl or
i music but because of you

if a
person have no love for himself no
respect no love for he work he
family he friend something
how can he ask for love in return
i mean why should he ask for it

and living out here in this rest
home asylum that be what you want

Thatll make you happy

i hope it will yes
she pause then

i be sorry

okay

i do not know if you would be
particularly interest in hear
anything about i

that i could relate as a
way of life that you would approve
of

i would like to be able to tell you

get to be before

i do not know what to say

tita suggested that we try to
i
do not know
i think that she
seem to feel we have get
some
understanding to reach
she
totally deny the fact that we
be never that comfortable with
each other to begin with
pause trying to gain
control
the good i can do be apologize

we both know i be never really
that good at it anyway
