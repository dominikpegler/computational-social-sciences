seat in the third row at a neil simon
comedy
jesus


christ
if
harvard or princeton could get hold
of the chink for a couple of semester

hug in a corn field but he be
hardly i lover
besides i always
travel alone

well that do not matter
that part
never interest i anyway
the
beatnicks be before i time and i
never get anything outta the hippy
but bad dope cliche and the clap
but the example of you life helped
i in i struggle to be a cowgirl

tell i about it

about

about be a cowgirl
what be it all
about
when you say the word you
make it sound like it be painted in
radium on the side of a pearl

cowgirl exist as an image
fairly
common image
the idea of cowgirl
especially for little girl prevail
in we culture
therefore it seem
to i the existence of cowgirl
should prevail
otherwise they be
be fool
in the rodeo hall of
fame in oklahoma city there be just
two cowgirl
two
and both of they
be trickriders
Trickriding be
what cowgirl have almost always
do in rodeo
we society sure
like to see it unconventional woman
do trick
that be what prostitute
call it you know
trick


you be political then

no madam
no way
there be girl on
the rubber rose who be political
but i do not share they view
i get
no cowgirl ideology to expound
politics be for people who have a
passion for changing life but lack a
passion for living it


do that last comment sound too
profound to be coming outta i mouth
it be not original
it be something i
picked up from the chink

really
the chink huh
i have gathered
that you sometimes speak with he
what else have you learned from the
chink

learn from the chink
oh i
ha
ha
that be hard to say
we mostly
uh a lot of he talk be pretty goofy

oh yeah now that i think of it the
chink taught i something about
cowgirl
do you realize that
cowgirl have be around for many
century
long before america
in
ancient india the care of the cattle
be always left up to young woman
they called gopis
be alone with
the cow all the time the gopis get
awfully horny just like we do here
every gopi be in love with krishna
a goodlooking young god who play
the flute like it be going out of
style when the moon be full this
krishna would play he flute by a
river and call the gopis to he
then he would multiply himself sixteen
thousand time one for each gopi
and make love to each one the way
she most desire
there they be
sixteen thousand gopis ball krishna
on the river bank and the energy of
they merge be so great that it
created a huge oneness a total union
of love and it be god
wow
quite
a picture huh

that could not be krishna could it
bit shrill for a flute
just we
rotten luck

get to run now
delores say i be
needed
Somebodys here
maybe it be
the countess

sissy cowgirl history be about to
be make
i be damn glad you be here
to witness it

it be cute
way cute than a cow

goat be always testing you
they be
like zen master
they can tell
instantly if you be fake you
feeling
so they play game with
you to keep you true
people should
go to goat instead of psychiatrist

it be so love

look at those playfully wise eye

ooo
it lick i

more and more people be discover
that cow milk be not fit for human
consumption
billy west say if we
can produce enough goat milk on
the ranch to make it worth he while
he will run it into fargo regularly

i be aware that tad lucas ride broncs
until she ninth month but i do not
think pregnant cowgirl be going to
be any asset on this ranch
i hope
you itchy clits who be sneak
down to the lake every night be
taking precaution
it be bad enough
we have get crane coming
we do not
need stork
i feel that those film
maker should be remove from the
rubber rose as soon as possible
man
can because nothing but trouble here
i also feel that we guest
should be excused while we discuss
this matter **further/far

delores zonks out on peyote at
least once a week but so far she
third vision have not happen
Niwetukame the mother goddess have
not get back in touch with she
meanwhile she and debbie be rivaling
each other like a couple of crosstown
high school
tension
cowgirl
tension
what a drag

what be Debbies position

debbie say that if woman be to
take charge again they must do it
in the feminine way
they must not
resort to aggressive and violent
masculine method
she say it be up
to woman to show themselves well
than man to love man set good
example for they and guide they
tenderly toward the new age
she be a
real dreamer that Debbiedear

you do not agree with debbie then

i would not say that
i expect she be
right ultimately
but i be with
delores when it come to fight
for what be mine
i can not understand
why delores be so uptight about the
chink
he could probably teach she a
thing or two
ee
that grass tickle
do not it
god know i love woman
but nothing can take the place of a
man that fit
still this be cowgirl
territory and i will stand with delores
and fight any bastard who might
deny it
i guess i have always be a
scrapper
look
this scar
only twelve
year old and i be felled by a silver
bullet

he be here

look at he
perverse as a pink
pickle

sick as a vice squad

he be in a snit
he want to see you
right after the barbecue

get the girl
he be going to see i
right now

any of you lady who would like to
join we you be welcome to stay on
as a full work podner at the rubber
rose
rest of you get pack and
i mean now

to move you lard ass off this
ranch

you will all be rounded up and send
to prison if you take this any
farther

you pathetic little cutesypoos
do
you actually suppose this exhibition
of childlike melodrama be advancing
the because of freedom

you owe we this here ranch as a
token payment for you disgusting
exploitation

then take it

go for it girl

go to you bunkhouse and remain there

well reach for you spray can

not one of these pussy have be
washed in a week

ha ha ho ho hee hee

wait

well be not you going to shake you
whanger at i

laughter die a
nervous chipmunk
death

i be a friend of bonanza Jellybeans

i know who you be

oh
well there be be some trouble
on the ranch
i come up here to get
out of the way
it be so dark now i
doubt if i could find i way back
down
if you could help

voice that wear no
pants
save you breath for the climb

yip
yip
ha ha ho ho and hee hee

personally i prefer stevie wonder
but what the hell
those cowgirl
be always bitching because the only
radio station in the area play
nothing but polka but i say you
can dance to anything if you really
feel like dance

but i do not know how to polka

neither do i
ha ha ho ho hee hee

so this be how jelly spend she visit
to the chink

what be that

Clockworks

Clockworks

the Clockworks be one reason that i
be here on siwash ridge
i accepted
the invitation to be initiated as a
shaman by an age siwash chief who
be the principle outside confederate
of the clock people

siwash huh

he be a degenerated warlock who
could turn urine into beer and the
honor that he extended i give i
right of occupancy in this sacred
cave on this faraway siwash ridge
i come to the dakota hill to
construct a clockworks of i own

but unlike the clockworks of the
clock people i tick more accurately
echo the tick of the universe
ha ha ho ho and hee hee

the clock people

during the second world war i bust
out of Tule lake detention camp
as
a JapaneseAmerican i have be put
there and watch over
i find refuge
with the clock people who discovered
i in a snow bank near dead i have
be climbing across the sierra nevada
mountain

then if you be japanese then why
be you called the chink

the clock people mistake i for
chinese
and the name stick
in the
same way that all indian tribe come
to be label indian through the
ignorance of an italian sailor with
a taste for orange it be only
fitting that indian misname i
the clock people however be not a
tribe rather they be a gather
of indian from various tribe
they
have live together since

the pivotal function of the clock
people be the keeping and observe
of the clockworks
it be a real thing
and be keep at the center at the
soul of the great burrow
insofar
as it be possible all clock people
death and birth occur in the
presence of the clockworks
aside
from birth or dying the reason
for the daily visit to the clockworks
be to check the time

these people have no other ritual
than this one
likewise they have
but one legend or cultural myth
that of a continuum they call the
eternity of joy
it be into the
eternity of joy that they believe
all man will pass once the clockworks
be destroyed
the destruction must
come from the outside must come by
natural means must come at the will
of this gesticulate planet whose
more acute stirring thoughtless
people call earthquake


the earth be alive
she burn inside
with the heat of cosmic long
she
long to be with she husband again
she moan
she turn softly in she
sleep
in the eternity of joy
pluralized deurbanized man at ease
with he gentle technology will
smile and sigh when the earth begin
to shake
i loved those loony
redskin but i could not be a party
to they utopian dream
after a
while it occur to i that the
clock people waiting for the eternity
of joy be virtually identical to
the christian waiting for the second
coming
or the communist waiting
for the worldwide revolution
or the
Debbies waiting for the fly
saucer
all the same
just more
sucker betting they share of the
present on the future bank every
misery on a happy end to history
well history be ending every second
happily for some of we unhappily
for other happily one second
unhappily the next
history be always
end and always not ending
ha
ha ho ho and hee hee

what do you believe in then

ha ha ho ho and hee hee

if this be adultery make the most
of it
i

i


sissy do not play dumb with i
you be
a good model but a shitty actress
the cowgirl be involved in this
whoop crane disappearance
you
know perfectly well they be
last
see in nebraska
do not make it to
canada
siwash lake be between
nebraska and canada
the cowgirl
have possession of siwash lake
and
who else but Jellybeans wild cunt
could possibly conceive of do
something so diabolical as to tamper
with the last flock of some nearly
extinct bird
how much do you know
about it
have they murdered those
crane the way they murdered i moo
cow

i do not know anything about it

sissy
you be trying to protect those
scuzzy bitch
well let you
conscience be you guide as i mommy
used to say but it will not work
those
stink slut be going to suffer

shit dear

well he be not out of danger but i
think we can safely say he be going
to make it
i would be pretty surprise
if he do not
however there be
evidence of injury to the frontal
lobe and i have reason to fear that
this injury may be permanent
the
patient may never again function as
a normal human being

brain damage
you mean he be going to
be a vegetable

vegetable
vegetable
i would not say
that no
we will not ascertain the
extent of the injury for some day
but there be a genuine possibility
of severe and last behavioral
defect
i would not classify it in
the vegetable category however

i be going to give it to you like
you have never have it before
oh you
do not know it could be this good
you be going to like it
you be going to
like it
you be going to like it so
good
you be going to love it so much
you be going to cry
you be going to cry
you be going to cry and cry
do you
like to cry
do you like it when it
hurt a little bit
whatever happen
to you it will be worth it
the way
i be going to give it to you it will be
worth anything
everything
go ahead
and cry if you want to
i like it
when woman cry
it mean they
appreciate i








i be afraid i can not help you

but doctor

please child do not be dismay
we
all have problem these day
but as
the painter van gogh said mystery
remain sorrow or melancholy remain
but the everlasting negative be
balanced by the positive work which
thus be achieve after all
i do not
suppose that means very much to you
i have retired
victim of a
malpractice suit

oh doctor
you have get to do it
you
and nobody else should be allow to
take away i gift


ah the thumb


the thumb the thumb the thumb the
thumb the thumb the thumb
one of
evolution most ingenious invention
a builtin tool sensitive to texture
contour and temperature
an alchemical
lever
the secret key to technology
the link between the mind and art
a
humanize device
the marmoset and
the lemur be thumbless
none of the
new world monkey have opposable
thumb
the spider monkey thumb
be absent or reduced to a tiny
tubercle
the thumb of the potto
be set at an angle of one hundred
eighty degree to the other digit


and so you be demanding at last the
privilege of thumb that nature have
perversely deny you

i just want to be normal give i
that oldfashion normality
it be
good enough for crazy horse and it be
good enough for i


ah yes
very well i dear
here be
what we can do

yep the whoop crane be here
all right
they be in fine shape
and as you musta see from you fuck
whirly machine unrestrained free
to go as they please
but this be
private property and you be not laying
a foot on it
none of you

we will be back with a court order and
a fistful of search warrant

just come back with a couple of people
who know what they be do and we will
let in for a nice close look at
the bird

and make sure at least one of they
be female and you well do as we
say or there may be trouble

it will be i extreme pleasure to
report to the president

who have be gravely concern
about the fate of we whoop
crane

and to the interior secretary and
to the american people that the entire
flock of crane be indeed at

siwash lake and in apparently
healthy condition

the crane have build brood
nest around the whole circumference
of the small lake and have

hatch chick there
counting
the young bird there be now
approximately sixty crane in the
flock
while this be good news it
be also quite bewildering



whooping crane be territorially
minded and have never be known to
nest as close as a mile to one
another yet here they be virtually
side by side

the rubber rose ranch have issued a
communique that be send to the
federal judge and copy of a
recording to the press today










that be Jellybean



































man this be the stupide music
i have ever hear
this radio should
have stay in the privy where it
belong

how do you

you know what you be get into if
you come over to the lake

yes but i want to be there
i want
to see Jellybean
i want to see the
crane

we hear on the radio that the judge
have set Deloress bail at fifty
thousand dollar
now she will not be
here when we really need she

the american civil liberty union
have requested an extension for the
rubber rose ranch
the government be
aware of the inflame situation and
be afraid that all the marshal and
agent might be too will to uncork
the bottle of blood

let we celebrate

be not that just like woman

look like every time we get together
thing be in a mess

so be it
it look serious this time
though
all these gun
be you
actually prepare to kill and die
for whoop crane

hell no the crane be wonderful
okay but i be not in this for whoop
crane
i be in it for cowgirl
if
we cowgirl give in to authority on
this crane issue then cowgirl become
just another compromise
i want a
fine fate than that for i and
for every other cowgirl
well no
cowgirl at all than cowgirl
compromise

how do this business get start
anyhow
why be the bird nest
here

you be aware that we be feeding
they be not you
we feed they brown
rice and they stay over a couple
of extra day
then we decided to
try something different
we mix
we brown rice with fishmeal
whooper love seafood and fishmeal
be cheap
then delores suggested
another ingredient and we think
that be what do the trick

you mean



they be drug

aw come off it sissy
what do you
mean drug
every live thing
be a chemical composition and anything
that be added to it change that
composition
when you eat a
cheeseburger or a three musketeer
bar it change you body chemistry
the kind of food you eat the kind
of air you breathe can change you
mental state
do that mean you be
drug

no i guess not

drugged be a stupid word

but the peyote be obviously affecting
they brain
it be make they break a
migratory pattern that go back
thousands of year

the way i see it be that the peyote
mellow they out
make they less
uptight
they be afraid of bad
weather and human
that be why they
migrate and keep to themselves
but
the peyote have enlighten they
it be taught they there be nothing to
fear but fear itself
now they be
digging life and letting the bad
vibe slide on
do not worry be happy
be here now

fear in wild animal be completely
different from paranoia in people
in the wilderness ecosystem fear be
natural and necessary
it be merely a
mechanism for maintain life
if
the crane have not have a capacity for
fear they would have disappeared
long ago and you would be have to get
loaded with common old everyday
meadowlarks and mallard

this here discussion be destine to
become academic
because we have get
less than half a bag of peyote button
left and Deloress run end up in
the Mottburg jail
so any day now
we will get a chance to see how the
whooper behave when they come down
to see if the peyote experience really
changed they or not
but in the
meantime i want to say this about
fear

judge greenfield at the request of
the have grant a fortyeight
hour extension of the deadline by
which the rubber rose cowgirl must
comply with he order
negotiation
between the cowgirl and the
government be expected to follow
another item in the forewoman of
the rubber rose ranch a delores del
ruby be now free on bond after have
be arrested in Mottburg with more
than fifty pound of peyote button
she bail have be paid by the owner
of the besiege ranch countess
product inc
miss del Rubys bail
have come from the tycoon personal
advisor a certain dr
robbins of
new york city

dr
robbins

every time i tell you that i love
you you flinch
but that be you
problem

if i flinch when you say you love
i it be both we problem
i
confusion become you confusion
student confuse teacher patient
confuse psychiatrist lover with
confuse heart confuse lover with
clear heart

it be not for ourselves that we take
this stand
it be not for cowgirl
it be for all the daughter everywhere
this be an extremely important
confrontation
this be womankind
chance to prove to she enemy that
she be will to fight and die
if
we woman do not show here and now
that we be not afraid to fight and
die then we enemy will never take
we seriously
man will always know
that no matter how strong we word
and determined we deed there be a
point where we will back down and give
they they way

i be prepare to win
victory for
every female live or dead who be
suffer the temporary defeat of
masculine insensitivity to they
inner live

i will fight the bastard

i will fight they with bean gas if
necessary

the sun going down
let we those of
we not standing watch get some sleep
in the morning we will plan we fight
tomorrow afternoon those of you who
like can join i in the reed where
the crane and i will be sharing the
last crumb left in the peyote sack

it be woman mission to destroy as
well as to give birth
we will destroy
the tyranny of the dull
but we can not
destroy it with gun
or whip
violence be the dullard breakfast
of champion and the logical end
product of he or she misplace pride
violence fertilize that which we
would starve
no we will destroy
the enemy in other way
the peyote
mother have promise a fourth vision
but it will not come to i alone
it
will come to each of you to every
cowgirl in the land when you have
overcome that in you own self which
be dull
the fourth vision will come
to some man too
you will recognize
they when you meet they and be they
steady sidekick in equal and ecstatic
escapade of poetic behavior and
romance

first thing you must end this
business with the government and the
crane
it be be positive and
fruitful but it be go far enough
playfulness cease to serve a serious
purpose when it take itself too
seriously
sorry i will not be with you
at the conclusion
as you know i have
be sick and stupid for a long time
i have a lot to make up for a lot
to accomplish and there be someone
important that i have get to see
now

well what we get to do be one of we
have get to go up that hill and tell
they boy that america can have it

wooden horse when i be twelve
haw
i be not really shoot with a silver
bullet

or be i


ha ha ho ho and hee hee
the brown paper bag

the brown paper bag be the only thing
civilized man have produced that do
not seem out of place in nature
crumple into a wad of wrinkle
like the fossilize brain of a dryad
it kinship to tree to knot and
nest unobscured by the cruel crush
of industry
absorb the element
like any other organic entity
blend with rock and vegetation as
if it be a burrow owl door
mat or a jack rabbit underwear a
no
kraft paper bag lay discard
in the hill of dakota and appear
to live where it lay
once long ago
it have borne a package of bun and a
jar of mustard to a kitchenette
rendezvous with a fry hamburger
more recently the bag have
hold
love letter

as a hole in an oak hide a squirrel
family jewel the bag have hidden
love letter in the bottom of a
bunkhouse trunk

then one day after work the button
nose little cowgirl to whom the
letter be addressed gather bag
and content under she arm slipped
out to the corral

past ranch hand pitch
horseshoe and ranch hand flying
tibetan kite saddle up and trot
into the hill

mile or so from the bunkhouse she
dismount and build a small fire
she feed the fire letter

one by one the way she girl friend
have once feed she french fry

as word such as sweetheart and
honey britch and forever and
always burned away the cowgirl
squirt a few tear
she eye be
so misty she forget to burn the bag

you know podner you can tune a
guitar but you can not tuna fish

god but it be good to be a cowgirl

be everything get bad

yes everything be get bad
but everything be also get good

the countess have come to we aid
the rubber rose ranch be officially
deeded to all the cowgirl
and i
have be ask to oversee the ranch
for a week
and as it turn
out the countess be not going to be
the vegetable the doctor think he
be
here a picture

i want to go back to the clock people
i kind of miss those fool redskin
and wonder what they be up to
what be
happen to jelly

she have a one wayticket to kansas
city

you mean she be dead

but that be an old story now
i
can not believe that you would leave
the butte

easy come easy go

wow you sure have a way with word

i can not help it if i grow up in an
antipoetic culture
language will be
different when i be with the clock
people though
they be from an oral
tradition
and i be not talking about
what you horny hop toad do in bed
every night

well if the clock people give you
any inside information on the end of
the world drop we a postcard

the world be not going to end you
dummy
i hope you know that much
he grow
uncharacteristically
serious
but it be going to change
it be going
to change drastically and probably
in you lifetime
the clock people
see calamitous earthquake as the
agent of change and they may be
right since there be a hundred
thousand earthquake a year and major
one be long overdue
but there be
far bad catastrophe coming
unless the human race can bring itself
to abandon the goal and value of
civilization in other word unless
it can break the consumption habit
and we be so conditioned to consume
as a way of life that for most of we
life would have no meaning without
the yearning and reward of
progressive consumption
it be not
merely that we bad habit will because
global catastrophe but that we
operative politicaleconomic
philosophy have we in such a blind
crab grip that they prevent we from
preparing for the natural disaster
that be not we fault
so the
apocalyptic shit be going to hit the
fan all right but there be some
of we it will miss
little pocket of
humanity
like the clock people
like you two honey if you decide
to accept i offer of a lease on
siwash cave
there be almost no
worldwide calamity famine nuclear
accident plague weather warfare or
reduction of the ozone shield
that you could not survive in that
cave

suppose that you bear five or six
child with you characteristic
all in siwash cave
in a
postcatastrophe world you offspring
would of necessity intermarry form
in time a tribe
tribe every member
of which have giant thumb
tribe
of big thumb would relate to the
environment in very special way
it
could not use weapon or produce
sophisticated tool
it would have
to rely on it wit and it sense
it would have to live with animal
and plant
as virtual equal
it be extremely pleasant to i to
think about a tribe of physical
eccentric living peacefully with
animal and plant learning they
language perhaps and paying they
the respect they deserve

how be i going to be the progenitor
of a tribe when i be living on an
isolate ridgetop with delores

that be you problem

listen to the way i be babbling
that
bullet must have loosen one of i
transistor
do not pay any attention
to i
you have get to work it out for
yourself
the westbound choochoo
leaf Mottburg at oneforty
i want
to be on it
will you drive i to
the station

schedule
ironic how i have to follow
timetable in order to get back to
the clockworks

do not ever bet against paradox
lady

if complexity do not beat you
then paradox will
ha ha ho ho and
hee hee
