nineteen light year
beyond





beyond epsilon Alangue
be Arrakis



it do look dry






each day the palm along the outer wall of
the palace at Arrakeen consume enough
water to sustain the live of one hundred
man
the palm be place by the
Harkonnens to flaunt they water wealth in
front of the city Fremen

only


there be have be documented sighting
of worm as large as meter in the
deep desert far from where we will be in
Arakeen
the desert belt and the south
polar region be marked forbid
why

the storm and the worm
be it true that
the sand can blow at seven hundred
kilometer per hour

it can render flesh to dust in minute
and these dry wind can generate
tremendous static electricity in the
atmosphere
we body shield will not have
enough power to operate in the open air on
Arrakis

well how do the Fremen survive there

we do not know much about the Fremen
they live in the deep desert
some of
they in the city and they have blue
withinblue eye

the eye yes yes
saturation of the
blood by the spice melange
could the
spice affect we in other way

many danger exist on Arrakis
for one we
know the Harkonnens would not have given
up they company contract so easily

the Harkonnens be we enemy yes
but
behind they i suspect be the emperor


you will make a formidable duke
