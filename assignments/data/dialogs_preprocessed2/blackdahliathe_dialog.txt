no
i do not

tell i something
Whyd you want to meet
betty short

i have work pretty hard to be loose and
free
but the way people described betty
it sound like she be a natural

how do you mean

hmmm
she be this poor girl
come from
nothing
but then she carry nothing
with she either
i do not know
when
you be rich sometimes you romanticize the
poor

i would not know

i be an emancipate minor and if you touch
i without a matron present i will sue you

please mister
i
i parent

and you do not recall any of the name
betty go out with last fall

they be just pickup

no one who would do she harm

you make the cast round together
ever get any movie work

no

so what about the film can

it be
a movie

dirty movie

you have to tell we the whole thing
sweetheart
so think it through

i be
cadge at a bar in gardena
this
mexican man raoul or jorge or something
starting talking to i
i think i be pregnant and i be
desperate wicked bad for money
he said
he would give i two hundred dollar to act
in a nudie film

he said he needed another girl so i ask
betty
the three of we drive down to
tijuana and we make the movie at this big
house outside of town
then he
drive we back to

be this around thanksgiving

do the mex give betty a viewfinder

do he seem particularly interest in
betty
do she see he again

mexico and i con he out of a print

where be that

film
for nothing

all she teacher used to say that
not
that a grease like meed know the
difference
maybe she coulda written for
the picture
but she wanted to be an
actress like every other silly girl

you folk still alive

it be you ball
what do
you want to do

i want to search every fuck inch of
every goddamn acre of emmett sprague
property if it take the rest of i
shitty career
and i know exactly where
we start

between i time with madeleine and the
local boom baron expose in the paper i
be practically an expert on emmett
Spragues land deal

for the first time since the begin of
the whole fiasco i stopped trying to
figure out who killed elizabeth short
instead i focused on where

and if i hunch be right we would not
have to look any far than one of
emmett Spragues condemned bungalow
one
that be isolated
abandoned

and most importantly close to a water
source
where one could drain a body of
it blood

bucky

god help she

box up the book and paper
maybe light
that lantern

you all right

that night i pictured myself the way i
wanted elizabeth to picture meher
knight in shine armor a reborn twobit
harness bull who cracked the big
unsolved homicide in california history
war hero a heavyweight champion

i stay with she that night and dream
of all the bullshit that would never
happen
not if i wanted to keep i job at
all
because there be no way for i to
make the arrest without admitting that
i would suppress evidence year ago
the
case would always be open
and so while it killed i to wait til
morning in some way
this be we last
night together

he father be a surgeon do you
know that
famous in scotland

what do you tell betty
what do you

morning i would already laid fifty down with
russ that he be we guy
amateur
taxidermist transient
if he be a cop
th and norton would have be right in the
middle of he beat

but i would be lying if i said i have not
wanted to nail the sicko myself giving
he ten round of Bleichert rage

maybe he would have go for a gun or
probably a knife and the Bleichert fist
would have given way to a full load of

in the chest

sprague said they find he croak in a
park lot downtown just twelve block
from where he would dump betty short
just
croak
natural cause if anything
about crazy georgie be natural
i hope
the evil eat he from the inside out
filling he with blackness like the
sawdust in Spragues goddamn dog


and then eldridge said
i be sure
that be the case mr
mayor but that be not
i dog and those sure as hell be not i
shoe

it be so nice of you to stop by again

course you have be stake out the
sprague house
four night in a row
i walk i dog every night
and i be almost
as nosy as you

yeah well
old habit die hard

i would be think about giving it to
charity but it be too valuable
i find
Eldridges receipt

it be a frederick Yannantuono original
inspired by an old classic novelThe
man who laugh by victor hugo

the clown in the paint be the book
main character Gwynplain
when he be a
child he have he mouth slash ear to ear
and then sell to the th century spanish
aristocracy to be used as a court jester

be you all right bucky

madeleine be eleven and she look
just like georgie
when he get out of the
hospital i give he the hugo book as a
present
i Gwynplain
but he be afraid
of Emmetts rage
after that
we rarely
speak

tell i about betty short

it be the cruel of joke
he would become
obsess with she
that filthy film

the cruel of joke

martha must not know
she be all that be
left of this family that be not die
you
consider she when you decide whether
we be worth it

honestly though
sometimes i think
martha be going to bring the whole
family down around she by chance
she
little stunt about tip the police to
LaVernes

she lie about that
to get Madeleines
goat

concoct a love triangle from the three
of we
the BleichertBlanchard rematch

emmett and demanding he hand over his
daughter when she preferred i

madeleine stalk lee
Revengekilling
he in Ensenada to avenge the sprague
honor
no mention of the black dahlia
murder case at all

she story enough to get she a psych tag
as a delusional schizophrenic and ten
year at Atascadero state hospital

so the brass girl take the fall for the
whole family
and i take the fall for i
clear i on the motel shootinga
cope code makegood for Blanchards
snuff

afterwards i be fired from the los
angeles police department on ground of
moral turpitude and conduct unbecoming an
officer
i think of turning over ramona
in hope of pulling a grandstander
turnabout

but i have people to protect
people
who already know that for the brief
of time and in the dark of place i
have be so so good at some thing

thank you elizabeth
