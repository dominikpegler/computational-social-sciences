sad or depressing or shock

you will not even tell i you name
what be shock about a name

even if the truth require a
certain adjustment


i used to go to the movie all the
time


i see a hundred situation like
this
man and a gun and a
lock door
lee marvin or steve
mcqueen
and i used to say to
lillian because we go to a
hundred movie that we see together
or that i see because she have see
they and i would say watch he kick
in the door with one kick and it
might be steve mcqueen or jeff
chandler holding the gun up like
this and he would turn and kick
the door and it would fly open at
once and i would say to lillian
how completely phony
whoever make
this movie have no idea how hard it
be to kick in an actual door in
real life
i still love lillian
but it be not easy to kick in a
door
i know they would lose and
they lost so what be we so upset
about
they lost tonight they will
lose tomorrow
it be written on the
wind




these wife named lillian
i used
to say to she you do not kick a
door once or twice and expect it to
open
it be only in the movie a man
can kick in a door with such
amazing ease
because a real door
require a tremendous and prolong
pounding before it finally give
way
he be a great player
how
could that ball go through his
leg

moment in
the history of the world
nicky take stevens head and move it tenderly against his
chest
when nicky release the head he have stevens toupee
in he hand
he look at it briefly then hand it to laurel
