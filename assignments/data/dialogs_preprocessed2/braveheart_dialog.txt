twelve year later Longshanks
supervise the wedding of he eldest
son also named edward who would
succeed he to the throne

as bride for he son Longshanks have
chosen a relative of he rival the
king of france

it be widely whisper that for the
princess to conceive Longshanks
would have to do the honors himself
that may have be what he have in
mind all along

have see to he obligation to
provide for a successor Longshanks
set about he fond business to
crush scotland and turn he power
against france

scotland
scotland

the french will grovel to anyone
with strength
but how will they
credit we strength when we cannot

coward send you

i will deal
with he

noble be the key to the scottish
door
grant they noble land here
in england
give we own noble
estate in the north
make they too
greedy to oppose we

sire
we noble will be reluctant
to relocate
new land mean new tax
and they be tax already for we
war in france

perhaps it be time to reinstitute an
old custom
grant they prima noctes
first night
when any common girl
inhabit they land be marry
we lords shall have sexual right
to she on the night of she wedding
that should fetch just the kind of
lords we want in scotland

moment the king conference be
end

council of scottish noble

among these be robert the th
earl of bruce a lead contender
for the crown of scotland

young robert we be honore

i father hear that Longshanks have
grant prima noctes

clearly mean to draw more of his
supporter here

the balliol clan have endorsed the
right licking Longshanks boot so
he will support they claim to the
throne
if we make a show of
opposition the commoner will favor
we

it be too soon to step out alone
i
father believe we must lull
Longshanks into confidence by neither
support he decree nor oppose
it

wise plan
and how be you father
we have missed he at the council

he strained he leg so that it pain
he to ride

in the name of god we
declare and appoint thou high
protector of scotland
and thou

sir william
inasmuch as you and
you captain hail from a region
long known to support the balliol
clan may we invite you to join we

i be

i father fight in support of yours

with this new success the result of
all of Scotlands effort now be
the time to declare a king

then you be prepare to recognize
we legitimate succession

you be the one who will not support
the true claim
i demand consideration
of these document

one price courage

but
what will you do

i will invade england
and defeat
the english on they own ground

Longshanks understand
this
this

there be a difference between we

exist to provide you with position
i think you position exist to
provide the people with freedom
and
i go to make sure they have it

wait

i respect what you said
but remember these man have land
castle
much to risk

and the common man who bleed on the
battlefield do he risk less

no
but from top to bottom this
country have no sense of itself
it
noble share allegiance with england
and it clan war with each other
if you make enemy on both side of
the border you will end up dead

we all end up dead
it be only a
question of how
and why

i be no coward
i want what you want
but we need the noble

noble

noble
you title give you claim to
the throne of we country
but man

courage
you arm speak loud than
you tongue
we people know you
noble and common they respect you
if you would lead they toward freedom
they would follow you
and so would
i

message from you cousin the prince
he say london have no more troop to
send

every town in northern england be
begging for help
where will wallace
strike first

i should think these small
settlement along the border

he advance

to what town

he come here


we will not allow a bandit to panic
the great city in northern england
close off the escape
let no one
leave

the city have empty already sire
only the scottish civilian remain

back
wait for it to burn

they have breached the wall

then do as i ordered




they wish to frighten we
or goad we
into attack too soon
do not look
away


behold the enemy we fight
we will
be more merciful than they have be
we will spare woman child and
priest
for all else no mercy

it be not you fault
stand up to
he

i will stand up to he and more

what news of the north

we have send
rider to speed any word

while i be in france fighting to
expand you future kingdom i learn
that stirling castle be lost we
entire northern army wipe out
and
you have do nothing

i have ordered conscriptions

wallace have sack york

impossible
how dare you bring a panicky lie

sire
thou own nephew
what beast
could do such a thing

if he can sack york he can invade
lower england

we would stop he

edward who be this shitpoker who
speak to i as if i needed his
advice

i have declared phillip i high
Counselor

you fight back at last

we must sue for a truce and buy he
off
but who will go to he
not i
if i come under the sword of this
murderer i would end up like i
nephew
and not you the sight of i
faggot son would only encourage an
enemy to take over this country
so
whom do i send

royal entourage come fly
banner of truce and the standard
of Longshanks himself

Longshanks
i have come

i be the princess of wales

wife of edward the king son

i come as the king servant and
with he authority

it be battle i want not talk

but now that i be here will you
speak with a woman

i understand that you have recently
be given the rank of knight

i have be given nothing
god make
man what they be

do god make you the sacker of
peaceful city
the executioner of
the king nephew i husband own
cousin

york be the stage point for every
invasion of i country
and that
royal cousin hanged a hundred scot
even woman and child from the
city wall

that be not possible

Longshanks do far badly the last
time he take a scottish city

he be a murder bandit he lie

latin

i be no bandit
and i do not lie

or in french if you prefer that
Certainmous et ver
ask you king to
he face and see if he eye can
convince you of the truth

hamilton leave we

lady

leave we now

she husband more of a queen than
she be
do you know that

let we talk plainly
you invade
england
but you cannot complete the
conquest so far from you shelter
and supply
the king propose that
you withdraw you attack
in return
he grant you title estate and
this chest with a thousand pound of
gold which i be to pay to you
personally

lordship
and gold
that i should
become judas

peace be make be such way



i understand you have suffer
i
know
about you woman

she be i wife
we married in secret
because i would not share she with
an english lord
they killed she to
get to i
and she be pregnant

i have never tell anyone
i do not know
why i tell you except because you
look
much like she
and someday
you will be a queen and you must
open you eye
tell you king that william wallace
will not be ruled
nor will any scot
while i live

sir
i leave this money as a gift
not from the king but from myself
and not to you but to the orphan
of you country

i sones loyal wife return unkilled
by the heathen
so he accepted we
bribe

no
he do not

then why do he stay
i scout say
he have not advanced

he wait
for you
he say he will
attack no more town if you be
man enough to come fight he

you speak with this wallace in
private
what kind of man be he

mindless barbarian
not a king
like you lord

the scottish noble have send he no
support
he army starve
we stall
have work he must withdraw
you
may return to you embroidery

humbly lord

you bring back the money of course

no
i have it to ease the suffer
of the child of this war

this be what happen when you must
send a woman
and a fool

forgive i sire
i think that
generosity might demonstrate you
greatness to those you mean to rule

i greatness be well demonstrated
with this

the weapon have be outlaw by the
pope himself

so the scot will have none of they
will they
i armorers have already
make a thousand

william french guard

that be why the pope outlaw the
weapon
it make war too terrible

how many do Longshanks have

thousand
you have make i guardian of scotland
so i tell you this be what we face

we must sue for peace

peace

we cannot defeat this

with cavalry not heavy like the
english but light fast horseman
like you noble employ we could
outmaneuver they bowman

it be suicide

sir william

we win at stirling and still you
quibble
we win at york and you
would not support we
then i said
nothing
now i say you be coward

please sir william
speak with i
alone
i beg you

you have achieve more than anyone
dream
but fighting these odds
look like rage not courage
peace
offer it reward
have war become a
habit you cannot break

war find i will
i know it will not
bring back all i have lost
but it
can bring what none of we have ever
have a country of we own
for
that we need a king
we need you

i be trying

then tell i what a king be
be he a
man who believe only what other
believe
be he one who calculate
the number for and against he but
never weigh the strength in you
own heart
there be strength in you
i see it
i know it

i must
consult with i father

and i will consult with mine

remember when the english turned
they hound on we
maybe we should
introduce they to we dog

this
cannot be the way

you have say yourself that the noble
will not support wallace so how
do it help we to join the side
that be slaughter

good day to you MLords

you misery
all of england shudder
with the news of renew rebellion

wallaces follower

to you haunting
if you wish to
take he i know a way

i have face he
have you

let she speak

he will fight you forever
but what
do he fight for
freedom first
and peace
so grant they

the little cow be insane

grant as you do everything else
with treachery
offer he a truce to
discuss term and send i to i
castle at Locharmbie as you emissary
he trust i
pick thirty of you
fine assassin for i to take along
and i will set the meet and the
ambush

you see i delicate son
i have
picked you a queen

we come in small group so the rebel
would not suspect

and you have reach wallaces man

we tell the villager and the
traitor pass it on
all that be left
be for you to say where

thanks for the food and drink
and
for bringing they yourselves

we be here to stay
we do not care to
live if we can not fight beside you

there be
one thing william
Longshanks be offering a truce
he
have dispatch he daughterinlaw
as he emissary and she have send
word that she wish to meet you
in a barn

it be william wallace sure
and
he be given up he sword
be ready

meet in a barn
it have to be a
trap
and only you would know i would
be aware of it

it do i good to see you

i be much diminished since we meet

there will be a new shipment of
supply coming north next month
food and weapon
they will trav

no
stop
i do not come here for
that

then why do you come

why do you

because of the way you be looking at
i now
the same way
as when we
meet

i know
you look at i
and see
she

you must forgive i what i feel
no
man have ever look at i as you
do

you have
you have a husband

i have taken vow
more than one
i have vow faithfulness to i husband
and sworn to give he a son
and i
cannot keep both promise

you understand
consider before you
laugh and say no
you will never own
a throne though you deserve one
but just as the sun will rise
tomorrow some man will rule england
and what if he vein run not with
the blood of Longshanks but with
that of a true king

i cannot love you for the sake of
revenge

no
but can you love i for the sake
of all you loved and lost
or simply
love i
because i love you


no one
hurry

when we
do you think of she

rest william

i rest

you rest be making i exhaust

come it will help you sleep

aye
but it will not let i dream

may he rest in peace
you have
already sealed the coffin

he be a modest man

it will not be long before Longshanks
too be encase in stone and he
crown divided for other to wear

we noble be frighten and
confuse
wallace have the commoner
stir up again from the highland
clan to the lowland village
in
another six month christ and the
apostle could not govern this
country

Longshanks know he son will scarcely
be able to rule england much less
half of france
he need scotland
settled and he trust you after
falkirk
if you pay he homage he
will recognize you as king of
scotland
we noble have agreed to
this as well

if i pay homage to another throne
then how be i a king

homage be nothing
it be the crown
that matter

the crown be that of scotland
and
scotland be william wallace

that be another matter
there be a
price to all this required both by
Longshanks and we noble
pay it
and you will be we king
and we
will have peace

sir william
we come to seek a
meet

you have all sworn to Longshanks

an oath to a liar be no oath at all
an oath to a patriot be a vow indeed
every man of we be ready to swear
loyalty to you

so let the council swear publicly

we cannot
some scarcely believe you
be alive
other think you will pay
they Mornays wage
we bid you to
edinburgh
meet we at the city gate
two day from now at sunset
pledge
we you pardon and we will unite
behind you
scotland will be one

i will meet you but only one way
if robert the bruce be there and
put he hand on i bible and swear
he loyalty to scotland

he have already agreed to come

you know it be a trap

probably
but we can not win alone
we
know that
this be the only way

i do not want to be a martyr

nor i
i want to live
i want a home
and child and peace
i have ask
god for those thing
but he be bring
i this sword
and if he will that
i must lay it down to have what he
want for i country then i will do
that too

that be just a dream william

we have live a dream together
dream
of freedom

you dream be not about freedom
they be about marion
you have to be
a hero because you think she see
you
be that it

i dream of marion be go

with she on the other side of death
i would welcome it

i know he will

here
and unarmed
i god he have a
brave heart

he be not to be harm
i have you
king absolute promise that he will
be imprisoned only

now we will have peace

do not look so fearsome do he

be it true
wallace be capture

simply because he elude you trap
do you think he be more than a man
i father be die
perhaps you should
think of we coronation

when will he trial be

wallaces
for treason there be no
trial
tomorrow he will be charged
then executed

Longshanks promised

you be surprise he would lie
balliol be murdered in a church
yesterday
you be Longshanks new
designate
you will be king

william wallace
you stand in taint
of high treason

against whom

against thou king thou vile fool
hast thou anything to say

never in i whole life do i swear
allegiance to you king

it matter not he be thou king

while many who serve he have
taken and broken he oath many time
i cannot commit treason if i have
never be he subject

confess and you may receive a quick
death
deny and you must be purify
by pain

all and swear allegiance to the
king that he might show you mercy

will he show mercy to i country
will he take back he soldier and
let we rule ourselves

in time who
know what can happen if you can
only live

if i swear to he then everything i
am be dead already

you people be lucky to have a
princess so kind that she can grieve
at the death of a stranger

you own people

even now you be incapable of mercy

nor you

unfamiliar as love

before he lost he power of speech
he told i he one comfort be that
he would live to know wallace be
