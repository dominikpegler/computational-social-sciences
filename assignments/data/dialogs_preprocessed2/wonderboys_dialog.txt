the young girl sit perfectly still in the
confessional



listening to she father boot scrape like
chalk on the ancient step of the church then
grow faint then disappear altogether


so

anyone

let i get this straight
the girl with the
big lip be depress because each night when
she father go off to work at the bakery she
mother sneak some mysterious lover into the
house
not only do this girl have to listen
to she mother working this guy in the next
room she have to wash the sheet each morning
before daddy get home
after a few week of
this she start to go a little nutty so daddy
take she to confessiononly once she get in
the box she get a whiff of the priest and
realize he be the mother secret lover
be
that it

i mean jesus

let we try to keep it constructive
shall we
howard what about you

constructive

he
he story be brutal man
they make i
want to kill myself

yes hannah

i think maybe we be missing the point
it
seem to i james strength as a writer be that
he do not take we by the hand
he treat we
like adult
he respect we enough to forget
we
that take


courage

well put hannah
and a good note to end on i
think

than surprise

emily left i this morning

so
i guess we just divorce we spouse marry
each other and have this baby right

walter
i see you have meet i friend

yes
she s charming

walters be telling i the most fascinating
thing about marilyn monroe and

who be it

joe DiMaggio
simply put antonia it s i
contention that they marriage tapped into the
very id of american popular culture
joe
DiMaggio represent metaphorically speaking
the husband as slugger
and though it may be
controversial i personally believe every
woman in some way desire to be marilyn
monroe

oh i could not agree more

and while i late have be on the new york
time bestseller list for week i can not
help but lament that i first book which
contain what i consider i fine write be
remainder in less than five
so i find
myself conflict

ask he if he be conflict about he house in
the hamptons

bartender every taxi driver everybody have an
idea or a
story that would make a great book
or a great movie

an idea

how do
you go from have an idea to have a book
how do you get across
what be the bridge the
bridge that allow you to walk on air from the
shoreline of inspiration to the terra firma of
accomplishment
faith
faith that you story be
worth the tell faith that you have the
wherewithal to tell it faith that the
carefully weave structure you create will not
collapse beneath you

and faith that when you get to the other
side someone will be waiting who give a damn
about the tale you have to tell

i will be right back

feeling he be going through the motion a bit

you mean because he career ruined and all

jesus

look james you appear to possesslike many
an aspire writer before you by the waya
rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which
dream be make

you be mad because i shoot you girlfriend
dog

it be not she dog
it be she husband
who said anything about girlfriend

okay james i wish you have not shoot i
girlfriend dog
even though poe and i be not
exactly what you would call simpatico that be no
reason for he to take two in the chest
still
the fact remains that i be the one who take you
up into the chancellors bedroom
i be the one
who have to take the blame
i do not know what
the hell i be think

even if i end up going to jail

you be still the good teacher i ever have

this be not what the university have in mind
when it promise a liberal education grady

it be within the realm
he take he souvenir
pretty seriously
and he be just a wee bit
prickly this morning

you do not happen to call the house last
night do you grady

homosexual love

book be not really greatI mean really great
but at time it be well very detailed you
know with the genealogy of everyone horse
and ail the dental record and so onand i
do not know maybe i be wrong but it sort of
read in place like well actually like

Hh huh
well thank for the thought but as
shock as this may sound i be not the first
writer to sip a little weed
and furthermore
it might interest you to know that one book i
write as you say under the influence
happen to win a little something called the
award which by the way i accepted under
the influence




want some help with that

do not touch it



let i get this straight
jerry nathan owe
you money
so as collateral he give you he
car

only now i be starting to think the car be not
exactly Jerrys to give

so whose car be it

the care his

such as

that be i car motherfucker


Hh hub
so

chapter

you will be all right then
look at carlyle
when he lost he luggage

that be MacCaulay

or hemingway when hadley lost all those
story

he be never able to reproduce they

bad example
look tripp i do not want to
depreciate the loss here but perhapsin a
sense this
be for the good

kind of a sign you be saying

in a sense

i do not think so
in i experience sign be
usually a lot more subtle

let i get this straight
all that paper that
go into the river
that be the only copy

fraid so

and you be saying it be some kind of sign
what
the fuck the matter with you

i be just saying that sometimes
subconsciously a person will put themselves in
a situationperhaps even create that situation
in order to have an arena in which to work out
an unresolved issue
it be a covert way if you
will of address a problem

i will tell you the problem
you behind the
wheel
there be you fuck problem

that be pretty simplistic do not you think

hey pal you do not start do crazy eights
in the middle of the street none of this
happen

excuse i
do you or do you not have a gun
to he head

he be trying to steal i car

ail right all right it be do
there be no
need to talk about it
it be do

so what be it about
you book
what be the story

i do not know

what he mean be it be difficult to distill
the essence of a book sometimes
Itlives in
the mind

yeah but you get to know what it be about
right
i mean if you do not know what it be
about why be you writing it

i could not stop



hey vernon

it be
comfort to know that americas child have
you for a teacher

nobody teach a writer anything
you tell
they what you know
you tell they to find they
voice and stick with it because that be all you
have in the end
you tell the one who have it
to keep at it and you tell the one who do not
to keep at it too
because that be the only way
to get where you be going

to go

recently

i have be trying to finish a book

and you wife left you

be that in i chart

i speak with the woman who saved you life
you be lucky she come along when she do

i know

you need to see a doctor mr
tripp
an
internist
and i think you really ought to
consider seeing a therapist as well

she told you about



she dog yes

actually it be she husband dog

look mr
tripp
you have a drug problem all
right
on top of that you have a bite on you
ankle that be severely infected
we pumped you
with antibiotic so you will be fine but another
day or two and you might have lost the foot
as
for you spell
i be guessing they be a result
of the anxiety you have be experience lately

they be anxiety attack
that be a little
disappoint

good luck next time

so be i friend
be sara still here

no
there be no one here

i have to see she
as soon as possible

look mr
tripp
if you really want to leave
i can not stop you
but i be going to write you a
prescription for a course of ampicillin and i
want you to follow it to the endno matter how
stupid you decide to be with everything else
all right



i wonder if you could show i something



be these the only one you have

kid









be that a suggestion

i be so glad to see you sara

i believe you
do that nice doctor let you

i told walter

do he still love you

it do not come up

well i do
i have always loved you sara
i
do not know it at the time but i would always be
waiting for you
i whole life
because you be
who i need
because nothing make sense without
you
because the good moment of every day be
the moment i first see you face
and because
when you leave a room there be no reason to be
in it any more
it be just a room again

do you just make that up

in the hospital
i be kind of excite about
it atthe time but then i be on pretty heavy
painkiller

even so
it be still true
every word

sara i promise even though commonsense might
tell you

do not write a page when a paragraph will do

you do not deserve i you know

i know but sometimes

you just go on faith
