dusty desert street saloon livery stable sunset
only there be something unsettle about it all
the color
be too mute and the angle not quite in perspective
pull

the rhythmic noise he trace it to the offender and silence
he with a look

without the rhythm and without apparently inner natural
rhythm to replace it leonards hand begin drag the pen
across the paper form vague scrawl each word less defined
than the last until they begin meld together into what
resemble nothing so much as a childes render of ocean
wave
the teacher resume chalk on the board
the boy from the
train begin tapping he pen again and guided again by the
rhythm leonard be able to give definition to the ocean
wave to form recognizable letter
and word
the teacher hesitate again and glare at the boy making the
irritate noise
the boy stop tap and leonards write
again become formless





the finish poem on the blackboard
the sound of child at
play on the schoolyard
the teacher alone in the classroom
he circle offend error on the last page of the last
composition book
he scribble a grade opposite the student
name in a grade book
he notice the absence of a grade in
leonards column

leonards desk
the teacher locate the miss composition
book buried under textbook
he take it back to he own desk
open it and stare curiously at the last lesson the poem or
rather leonards illegible representation of it
he consider early lesson in the book
he begin to see in
the script a pattern of deterioration
he reach the last
entry again and stare at the few recognizable word drowning
in the wave

novel

other she be on she foot
nd unlike the other she seem
to sayer to have be headed somewhere before turning to stone
again


he decide that she destination be the drink fountain
across the room
and that it be the table like a barrier that
have arrested she progress
he move the table
in what appear to be slow motion she take a tiny step
and
another
and another before encounter and be blocked
by an empty wheelchair
she stop
sayer move the wheelchair and all other obstacle out of she
path
she continue and eventually make it halfway to the
fountain before mysteriously stopping again
sayer study the puzzle
there be no longer any barrier
in she way but she be not moving
defeat he go to the
fountain himself fill a paper cup and take it to she
across the room a man in a wheelchair another ghost

shaking head no

in some other file cabinet
somewhere





p





one would think that after a point
enough atypical something would
amount to a typical something
but a typical what

miss costello no doubt have less of an idea than sayer what
the what could be

doctor

sleep that in most case last
several month
the doctor in the dark watch forty year old footage
projected onto a screen by a preWorld war bell howell
a motionless man in a chair he head thrust back mouth gape
open arm suspended out from an emaciate torso as if from
invisible string

seem fine as though nothing have
happen
year go by five
ten fifteen before anyone
suspected they be not well

after i be through dr
sayer
if
you would not mind


do you think it be possible that
simple parkinsonian tremor taken
to it far extreme could
appear as no tremor at all

be you speaking to i

if jail the compulsion in the
parkinsons patient be somehow
accelerate
demonstrate what
he mean
the hand the shaking the
tic the head bobbing the
quicken speech
he be become a mass
of tic and
accelerate speech
might they not cave in on
themselves and in effect turn
the person into stone

dr
sayer yes
i be a chemist doctor
i leave it
to you guy to do the damage

candy



we all believe in the miracle
of cortisone until we patient
go psychotic on it
now it be
LDopa

with all due respect i think it be
rather too soon to say that

with all due respect it be
rather way too soon
let the
chemist do the damage

do you read the case the
husband who come home to find his
wife sing
she have not feel
like singing in year

pg



i read they all
soberly
all
thirty case have mild parkinsons
you Parkies if that be what they
be have not moved for decade
you know well than to make a
leap like that you want to
believe there be a connection that
do not mean there be one

what i believe what i know be
that these people be alive
inside

how do you know
because they
catch tennis ball

i know it
sayer do not elaborate but he tone be resolute
and it have
the intend effect on kaufman cause he to consider the
possibility that sayer could somehow know it as a fact

kill they


and what if this drug be to
cure they
somewhere behind Kaufmans eye sayer can see he think a
change or reminiscence long ago long buried of thing he
once believe or wanted to believe

how many do you think i d let you
put on it

all of they
some of they
one of they



one
with the family consent
signed
sayer try to hide he elation and turn to leave before
kaufman change he mind

thing we just do


with great trouble
he set it down
it have to do with a chemical in
the midbrain or rather the lack
of it called dopamine
LDopa
replenish this dopamine making
it possible for these patient
to move more naturally
he pick up the cup again gracefully and set it down

leonard close the book but hold onto it and the other like
they be gold

i used to read quite a lot
before
i
yes i know


thank you for these
i
sayer nod that he be welcome

have you think about what you would
like to do today

everything

i be not sure i can arrange that

try
sayer smile again
for a man who just yesterday learned he
have be cheated out of the great part of he life leonard
seem to have recovered extraordinarily

let we approach it this way
what

x do you think you would like to do

p


i would like to go outside



though it be only a toyota it dashboard to leonard
resemble something out of jules verne
he allow sayer to
buckle he seatbelt for he and watch with fascination as
sayer perform the complex preparatory sequence necessary
apparently to make the car go
the car pull away
above framed in a second story window of
one of the building stand a lone figure looking out
leonards mother



tight on the radio
sayer switch it on
to leonards
amazement classical music fill the interior
and



billboard advertising color television and electric shaver
bus which have grow over the decade to a behemoth scale
ultramodern house project and gas station
futuristic car
leonard cannot imagine a more enthralling reintroduction to
the world and stare at it all with wonder
everywhere he
look there be something extraordinary


what a wonderful place the bronx
have become
the music




rose

leonard put he face close to it to appreciate it fragrance
he touch it petal gently explore they and be quietly
astonish by the tactile sensation
sayer watch
he too can appreciate wonder of the real
world especially those of a botanical nature but not with the
purity or intensity leonard can
pull back reveal they in the middle of a vast garden of
countless thousands of rose



p

boat and fish market and lush vegetation
paradise compare
to the bronx
the toyota turn down a side road near the water t
and into the driveway of sayers small wooden house
and the mu ic end



tea bag steep in a pot on a clutter kitchen counter
sayer exhausted from the day hunt in vain through pack
box on the floor for crackers cooky something he can
offer he guest
he keep glance in at leonard who be wandering around the
dine room navigate around packing box to browse at the
spine of book
notice sayer watch

you just moved here

yeah
well five year ago

sayer shrug disappear into the kitchen a moment


before
peek back in to see what leonard be looking at now
a small i
frame photograph of a boy with a toy sailboat and a forlorn
expression pose in front of a curtain
the boat obviously a
photography studio prop

you son

i actually
t

looking closely at
the photograph
you seem uncomfortable

i probably be
sayer disappear into the kitchen again
and a moment later
glance back in around the door frame at leonard who have moved
over to an old sideboard on which several pair of glass be
neatly arranged


each have a specific purpose

p

as leonard consider each pair of glass

those be i normal interior
glass
and spare pair
those
i wear outside
two pair in
case i los
e one
those those be
i daytime reading glass
and
spare
those be for close work
for fine print
those be i
nighttime read glass
leonards examining the frame of this last pair closely

that be heavygauge metal so when i
fall asleep and roll over on they
i do not wreck they
they be
indestructible
leonard return the indestructible one to they proper place
and consider they all together

as long as i pretty much know
ahead of time what i will be looking
at it work out i do not have to
carry all five pair around

what if you just want to go for a
walk

walk be a problem
walk be
the hard thing
you just never
know
he be absolutely serious like a man plague for year by an
imponderable dilemma
he retreat back into he kitchen before
reappear again with the pot of tea two mismatch cup and
some saltine on a tray

i hope you will forgive the
inelegant presentation
i do not
entertain much





they have clear place on the sofa and chair and sit there

p


i can date i interest in science
precisely actually
i would be
send off to board school a
place perhaps not quite as
dickensian as i remember it when
i happen to come across the
periodic table of element
smile at the
thought
i memorize it
which i admit be
a rather precocious thing for a
seven year old to do
and i
remember feeling


not so much a
sense of accomplishment


as
comfort
the halogen be what
they be
the alkali metal be
what they be
each element have
it place and nothing could
change that
they be secure no
matter what

leonard nod perhaps more out of politenes than
understand
sayer nod too feeling perhaps a little
exposed

you be not marry

no

i be not terribly good with people
i like they
i wish i could say i
have more than a rudimentary
understand of they
maybe if they be less
unpredictable



eleanor would disagree with you


p


miss costello

oh yes of course
she be spoken to you about i
leonard nod
sayer can not imagine why nor what she might have
said
fear the bad

Whatd she say

that you be a kind man
that you
care very much for people
sayer shift in he chair uncomfortably
a

but you mean normal people
sayer seem at a loss as to how to respond
the accompany

we should be get back
sayer cross over to the sideboard to the pair of glass
stare at they for several moment and pick up two pair





climbing out of he car kaufman see sayer striding toward
he
he glance to the sky kaufman to god and silently
complain to he




cafeteria worker carting serving tray back to the kitchen
nurse and orderly and office worker at table with finish
meal and cup of coffee
they seem unaware of drs
sayer and
kaufman at a table near the door

we talking about
to put they all on the dosage mr
lowe be on


about twenty
thousand dollar
kaufman stare at sayer aghast
he know LDopa be expensive
but not that expensive
he manage to recover somewhat

that would be for how long

about a month

month
sayer nod
kaufman glance away
stare blankly at face at
other table
back to sayer

i can not go before the board with
that
i could


he laugh to himself at the futility of it

i be think of speaking to the
patron

the few patron this hospital have
give what they can

well we would have to convince they
to give more than theyre
accustom to giving
he have not intended as impudent a tone as that which come out
more calmly

perhaps if they see mr
lowe










i think you overestimate the
effect mr
lowe have on people
we be talking about money here
kaufman sip at he coffee and slowly become aware of the
silence around they
no one be talking
he glance up as miss
costello walk by setting something on the table in front of
he
she leaf the cafeteria without a word
make out in she name
kaufman turn it over
she have endorsed
it back to bainbridge hospital
fernando walk by and out leaving he salary check on the
table
then ray the pharmacist leaving he
then the nurse
who reluctantly read moby dick to the patient
then a
cafeteria worker
secretary
clerk
janitor
the cafeteria be soon empty except for sayer and kaufman
long silence



mm film of leonard before LDopa a wide shot of he
absolutely motionless in he wheelchair


there be extreme rigidity of the
axial musculature


only vague
available motion in the neck


no voluntary movement in the
limb


tight shot of leonards entrance face appear on the screen


perhaps most strike be the
profound facial masking which
we now know should not have be
confused with apathy

tight on sayer the light from the projector flickering on his
face

virtually aphonic mr
lowe could
articulate no word but rather
only with considerable effort an
occasional noise a kind of

in the darkness sit kaufman the rest of the board of
director some elderly patron of the hospital and near
sayer miss costello
she hand he a scribble note
less scientific it read

isolated circumstance the
mention of he name note of
particular piece of music the
touch of another human being
managed on occasion to briefly
summon he but these awakening
be rare and transient last
only a moment or two

the rest of the time he remain
in a profoundly eventless place
deprive of all sense of history
and happening and self
encysted cocoon envelop in
this metaphorical if not
physiological equivalent of sleep


or death

cheerfulness it shed upon the
earth as much as any creature
live



and he be moving into the light
