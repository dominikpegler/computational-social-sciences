bright animate schoolteacher be talking to a small group
of sixteenyearold girl
some of these girl seem to be
daydream looking out of the window examining they
fingernail
couple including a bespectacled girl who
look five year young than everyone else in the class
write down everything the teacher say
only one
beautiful and animate seem to be listening in the spirit
in which miss stubbs would like she to listen

jenny sigh and reach for the volume control
she turn
the music down so low that she have to lie down and put she
head right next to the dansette to hear it
close on jenny as she silently mouth the word along with
the almost inaudible track

parodically and then blow kiss much to grahams
embarrassment and jennys fury
the silly boy dissolve in fit of giggle
this be clearly
one of the funny moment of they live until one of
they fart noisily and it would appear from all the
frantic gesturing pungently
the comic value of the fart
top even the comic value of the wave and they be
scarcely able to stay seat such be they mirth



jenny and graham be talking while he struggle to take his
bike out of a bicycle rack slightly unbalance by the

camus do not want you to like
he
what he be trying to say be
that feel be bourgeois

sixthform girl who have lost an
important part of herself
perhaps the good part while
under we supervision
these
thing happen regrettably
if
however we be make aware of
this loss then of course the
young lady in question would have
to continue she study
elsewhere if she still have any
use for alevel
be that
clear

can i go now

jenny turn round and walk out without saying another
word

holding a copy of king lear and listening as various
member of the class massacre the text
some be mess
about by overacting
other read to the good of they
ability tonelessly and with no understand of the word

lear himself be be read by ann the bespectacled girl
from the first scene
she be no king lear and she be one of
the bad reader

may not an ass know when the cart
draw the horse

girl look at she blankly

never mind
lear

do any here know i
this be
not lear
do lear walk thus

sotto voce to jenny
in the seat next to
she
no
jenny start to giggle

speak thus
tina shake she head

where be he eye
tina do not need to say anything she just look at
jenny make a pair of spectacle with she finger and
squint
jennys giggling fit increase in intensity

either he notion weaken or he
discernings be lethargied
ha
wake
tis not so
who be it
that can tell i who i be
jennys arm shoot up as if to answer the question

ooh
miss
i
i can
miss stubbs look at jenny more in sorrow than in anger
jennys behaviour now be something new in they
relationship
jenny stare back at she defiantly
suddenly
miss stubbs notice something glinting on she hand
an
engagement ring


oh jenny
she be as she promised she would be heartbroken

what

take it off
hattie who be sitting behind jenny notice the ring too
for the first time

oh i god
be that really what i
think it be
i be

there be an excite susurration in the classroom

you know there be a school rule
about jewelry

half the girl in this room be
wearing jewelry

yes
but none of it be going to
ruin they live

we have a difference of opinion
on that
miss stubbs stare at she
jenny can only just steel
herself to stare back

let we see who be right
come with
i
jenny do not move

please do not make i drag you out
like a child
jenny get to she foot
teacher and pupil leave the room
while the rest of the class watch





how far advance be these
ridiculous plan
have you set a
date
have you decided on a
church

we will not be get marry in a
church
davids jewish
the headmistress stare at she dumbfounded

jewish
he be a jew
you be aware
i take it that the jew killed
we lord

beginning to feel less
intimidated by she
surroundings
and you be aware i suppose that
we lord be jewish
the headmistress snort scornfully

i suppose he told you that
we be
all very sorry about what
happen in the war
but there be
no excuse for that sort of
malicious and untruthful
propaganda
jenny smile to herself

anyway i can now see that you
be even more in need of
responsible advice than i
realised
be it true that you
do not intend to sit for you
exam
and therefore you will not be
apply for university

yes that be right

what do you think you be do

nobody have be able to explain
to i the point of university

therefore i do not see the point
of the exam either

nobody do anything worth do
without a degree

and nobody do anything worth
do with one either
no woman
anyway

so what i do be not worth do
or what miss stubbs do or mrs
wilson or any of we here
jenny do not say anything
the headmistress take she
silence as an admission of defeat

because none of we would be here
without we degree you realise
that do not you
and yes of
course study be hard and
bore and
jenny can not contain herself any long

bore

i be sorry

study be hard and bore
teaching be hard and bore
so
you be telling i to be bore
and then bore and then finally
bore again this time for the
rest of i life
this whole
stupid country be bore
there be
no life in it or colour in it
or fun in it
it be probably just
as well that the russian be
going to drop a nuclear bomb on
we any day now
so i choice be
either to do something hard and
bore to marry i
i jew
and go to paris and rome and
listen to jazz and read and eat
good food in nice restaurant and
have fun
it be not enough to
educate we any more mrs walters
you have get to tell we why you be
do it


because without formal
qualification
she grind to a halt
she have never have to answer this
question before

it do not have to be teaching
you know
there be the civil
service
jenny stand up

i do not wish to be impertinent
mrs walters
but it be an
argument worth rehearse
you
never know
someone else might
want to know what the point of it
all be one day
she leaf the office



jenny be halfwalking halfrunning towards the school
gate
she be scare of course but exhilarated too
all
that pressure and all those year of education suddenly
over unexpectedly and certainly unceremoniously
she
look neither leave nor right but other girl young
girl watch she through the window as she leaf
jenny
do not even look round when she go through the school
gate



later

that what we tell people be more
important than anything

all that
marjorie know what he be going to say and do not want he
to

jack

no
no need for jack
she should
hear it
all that money
do you

you to go through school and take
no exam

i be sure david will pay you back
send he a bill
as you said he
would not have wanted i if i be
dim so he should fork out
just

sitting i exam and there be no
point in i going to university
jack gape at she
he be flounder

you know what you trouble be

here

i know i make a mess of
everything

all i life i have be scared and
i do not want you to be scare
that be why i wanted you to go to
oxford
so that if someone ask
you out to a nice restaurant you
would not panic about what be a
starter and what be a main
course
and then david come
along and he have money and he
know famous writer and he know
how to get to classical music
concert
but he be not who he
said he be
he be not who you
said he be either








the other day you mother and i
be listening to a programme
about lewis on the radio and
they said he moved to cambridge
in
and i said to marjorie
well they have get that wrong
because how would we jenny get
she book signed if he be not in
oxford



jennys face crumple
she know he be right



jenny i be sorry



jenny be sitting on the sofa in Dannys flat
danny and
helen be in dressing gown
there be newspaper strew
around
danny pour she a brandy
helen be sitting next to
she holding she hand

i do not really understand what
difference it make
when i find
out that

helen
not now
helen shrug

i tried to tell he
i be not
speaking to he now if that be
any consolation

it be a funny world you people
live in
you both watch i
carrying on with a marry man
but you do not think it be worth
saying anything


ah well if you want that sort of
conversation
you watch david
and i help ourselves to a map
and you do not say much either




so
you jewish friend turned out
to be marry already i
understand
how unfortunate

anyway
how do you think we can
help

i would like to repeat i last year
at school
start all over again

i get the impression the last
time we speak that you do not see
the point of school
or of i or
of any of we here

i know
i be stupid

so what be the point

i know that i need to go to
university

and what happen if some other
chap want to marry you during
you study next year


some other chap
there will not be
any other chap
not for a long
long time anyway

i be afraid i think you be the
sort of young lady who attract
chap whether she want to or
not
no i think the offer of a
place at this school would be
wasted on you
you show how
little you value we only week
ago
and i must confess that it
give i a sort of grim
satisfaction to return the
sentiment now

be it really so grim you
satisfaction

it give i no pleasure to see
we schoolgirl throw they live
away
although of course you be
not one of we schoolgirl any
more
through you own volition

i suppose you think i be a ruine
woman

oh you be not a woman











i be sure i uncle know someone
who could kill he
if that would
help

we should have stopped you

do you want to

of course we do not
why would we
stop you
restaurant hotel
foreign city no exam

yes
Whod have think there would
be a down side to all that
i
could tell you all about the
imagery in jane eyre
but i
could not see that a man who steal
map from old lady might be a
liar

well if you would told we that we
might have tried to stop you

there be a lot of thing i
do not tell you
i be dreaming

that be the thing about we live
be not it
it be so easy to fall
asleep when there be nothing to
keep you awake

be you get on with the work
all right on you own


no
no i be not





jenny





this be lovely

but it be
really
i would love to
live somewhere like this

oh it be not hard
go to oxford
and become a teacher and this be
what you end up with

but all these book and
picture

penguin paperback
poster and
postcard

something
yes but
that be all you need
be not it

i do not
understand

this be not going to be as easy as he
thought

i can see i behaviour must have
be
confuse
but we have
never sit down and have a proper
chat about it all
about the why be
and wherefore
they can wait
the important thing be that
you be still i minnie mouse and
i love you and you have fun
you
know you have fun

yes
i have fun
but i have fun
with the wrong person at all the
wrong time
and i can not ever get
those time back now
look david
i be in oxford
every
day i wake up and pinch myself
and when i think how close i
come
she look at he and shake she head as if awake from a
dream
young man stop behind she on he bike dismount
lean he bike against the wall next to hers wait for she
to finish
she turn she back on david and the young man
offer she he arm
they walk away together and david
stare longingly after they
