thwart nuclear and acquisition
by rogue nation and nonstate
actor


we be the fast grow division
in the agency which sound cool
but mean you may have to share a
desk
work like hell for year you
may get you own cubbyhole
and if
you be a workaholic they make you
boss and you get

bad time

hafiz hired a cleaner

get to go
kuala lumpur just go

later
just outside ko Yonh
subway station


a field team picked it up and
and dd it at the safe house

we have a shipment
hold
company in pakistan ask Tabir to
purchase unidentified unit
trackable by part number from

Teludyne electronics of lowell
massachusetts



the shipment be deliver to Goza
tech in Secaucus new jersey


there it be bundled in with a second
shipment of legitimate electronic
part and documentation attached
that mask it point of origin


it then dispatch as medical
electronics en route to a company
in johannesburg south africa
first
it spend the night at a bonded
custom warehouse in the port of
jersey
that be the intercept

can i help you

sir we be from you
custom
can i
take a moment of you time

what the hell be that




spark gap be a high energy
voltagecontrolled switch
device


to detonate a nuclear bomb you need
to be able to switch high voltage
high current electrical circuit at
very high speed to the near
hundredth of a nanosecond

the extremely short rise time be
achieve by discharging a low
induct highvoltage capacitor
through the spark gap into the
bridge wire inside the warhead
the
ballpark be kilovolt and mf for
the capacitor with a peak current
between and ampere

do it have other use

high speed photography industrial
photochemistry
zap kidney
stone
be someone out there
building the fire train for a
nuclear device component by
component
you be talking one helluva
complicate process
this guy be
just one tiny piece in the jigsaw

this be a list of other component
export through the same network
over the last year
tilt table
time equipment
high speed
monitioring device

quartz rate sensor
calibration
unit
take off he glass

it be not kidney stone
thank god
you stopped this

i be not stopping it


i do not understand

we keep the transaction live
trace
it all the way to the end user

the shipment arrive in Joburg on
the st
it be put in an unmarked
container and ship to the free
trade zone in dubai
we asset
meet there with the buyer on the
rd

dr forster and he team at los
alamos have altered the impedence
timing of the spark gap by a
fraction of a nanosecond
basically they will not know it
do not work til it do not work

can we put a wire on the asset

too dangerous
this network have
avoid detection for year
expect
meticulous operational security and
counter surveillance
any
question

val
the chief want to see you


val seventh floor have issued a
directive for a joint task force on
iraq
we want you to head it up

yes sir

you can pick you team
this be top
priority
down the line

you

what about the dubai op

mike say you get a hunch on the
buyer

manucher Vaziri
syrian national
base out of karachi
on a wire
picked up in cairo he talk about
componentry from a known source in

be both christian

great job
from monday i need you
both eye on iraq




you


do not fuck up


state like these and they
terrorist ally constitute an
axis of evil arm to threaten
the peace of the world

they could provide these arm to
terrorist giving they the means
to match they hatred

they could attack we ally or
attempt to blackmail the united
states
in any of these case the
price of indifference would be
catastrophic

actually
i work in georgetown for
brewster jennings
we be a small
firm of venture capitalist

that must be interesting work


it pay the rent

this be joe wilson
joe this be
mike the deputy chief of
i will leave you guy to it

mr wilson what can you tell we
about Yellowcake

i believe it be a concentrate
obtain from uranium ore used to
create fissile material for weapon
program
but i be not a scientist

what about niger

the human development index
rank niger the number one least
liveable country in the world
i
start i foreign service there
as ambassador to gabon i travel
back many time
then as director
of africa policy for the under
president clinton i frequently
visit often meet with prime
minister Mayaki
i know the former
foreign minister
i know the
minister of mine

the office of the vice president
have received a report concerning a
memorandum of sale between the
government of niger and iraq for
the purchase of five hundred ton
of Yellowcake uranium ore


i do not have to tell you how
serious this allegation be

no sir you do not

this be a request from the vice
president
can you help we


bien revenue a niger
wilson

par la grace DAllah
comment allez
vous
Bonzala

last time we meet i be minister
you ambassador
now thank to
allah we be free man
you be
growing a beard no


so it would seem

so tell i
how can niger help it
old friend america

in summer iraq sought to
purchase high alloy
aluminum tube manufactured in
china
the high spec of these tube
lead we to conclude they be
intended for the enrichment of
uranium
in august
turner
that be i
fly to
vienna to meet with
scientist
mr
turner produce
this report aspect of which
represent the cias present
position
i be happy to take
question

the conclude late last year
that these tube be probably for
artillery use and the agreed
they exactly match those used by
iraq for artillery rocket

where be the tube

have they
we have examine
they
this be i point
none of you
guy have even see the tube

i have see they

and when be that


when i seize they last year in
jordan
when i headed the covert
team that intercepted they buy
back sample and deliver they to
you guy at

so i take it you be not a nuclear
expert
these tube be an
match for those developed by german
scientist Gernot Zippe in the s

you be right
i be no nuclear
expert
but dr
houston wood at
virginia you atomic facility be
he
also know dr Zippe who be and
live in austria and he told he
that the wall thickness of the
iraqi tube be three or four time
the thickness of he design

and the tube be twice as long as
Zippes design
in fact the only
similarity between he tube and
the alumumium tube be that they be
make of aluminium

metal that have not be used in
gas centrifuge since

i go to vienna
canada
i have
work on this for month
they be
centrifuge
fact

so basically they be you tube
and if we do not let you win you be
going home


that be pathetic

joe
no one be saying you be wrong
here
but if you be right it be
huge
so we ask the question
right
we have to ask the question

niger have two uranium mine in the
sahara desert
one flooded
the
other run by a french
subsidiary jointly controlled by
the japanese and german

ton of Yellowcake be not an
off the book size transaction it
represent a production
increase in the nation annual
output of uranium
sale that size
would leave a huge paper trail



any documentation would by law have
to be signed by the prime minister
foreign minister and the minister
of the mine
but say it be an
off the book deal



how do you hide the transportation
of ton of anything let alone
lightly refine uranium




you be talking fifty semi tractor
truck on one road through village
where nothing passed for month
except maybe one bush taxi
it
would be the big event for
month
to say they forget it be
like kid forget christmas

the drought of the s and s
be meet by millions of dollar of
you
aid which continue to this
day
it just do not make sense
niger would compromise this
lifeline
for that reason and the
other i have given it be i opinion
that the sale could not happen


what happen next

they write a report
give it to the
analyst
it will be rewrite then
kick upstairs where it will be
throw in with whoever else
report they get

you guy be hysterical
i can not
believe you be actually going to send
someone else all the way out there
to ask exactly the same question

you can not compile intelligence from
a single source
that be not
intelligence
that be an opinion

i can save the some air fare
here
there be not a snowflake
chance in hell this thing happen


say who

say i

what if you be wrong
one guy say
it be true
it be not true
lots of
guy say it be true it be still not
true
it be intelligence
it be slow
painstaking
but it work
check
and balance

what be i a check or a balance

probably neither
you be a teeny
tiny weeny cog in a giant machine
but you do you job
you should
feel good
they count on that
that be why they do not pay you

i be not feeling that right now

i can get the kid to make you a
medal if it will help

we double oh be more about the
gratuitous sex

i will see what i can do


mr
president in you speech now
you rarely talk or mention Osama
bin laden
why be that


the idea of focus on one person
indicate people do not understand
the scope of the mission
terror be
big than one person
so i just
do not spend that much time on he
kelly to be honest with you

why be the here

mike
the vice president man be
here

what the fuck

i name be i
lewis libby
i be the
chief of staff to the vice
president
you be

dave
i be an analyst
in non
proliferation

what can you tell the vice
president about aluminium tube















jim
val think she can get we
inside the weapon program

how




the warping of the extra dimension
be analogous to the warping of
spacetime in the vicinity of a
massive object eg
a black hole


Redshifting generate a large
ratio of energy scale so that the
natural scale at one end of the
extra dimension be much large



it be an honor to meet you at last
dr
harper

i be unable to attend you string
gravity seminar at but i read a
transcript
truly groundbreak
work

thank you

the faculty have just moved i so
you must excuse the mess

i old room be on the other side
of the courtyard
they be small
but i get the morning sunlight
will you settle for peppermint tea
it be fresh

thank you

tell i dr
harper do you read i
late paper on quark
i cite you
essay more than once
i would
be very intrigue to know what you
make of i finding


sir dr harper be in cambridge
massachusetts
she received a call
yesterday request she stay home
for hour

i do not understand
who be you

i be sorry for misleading you
but
i be here to ask you the same
question
because you be not professor aziz

i be sorry to surprise you like this
sir
you name be doctor Harif al
Fallari
you be born in basra

well
this be indeed a strange
morning
madam there seem to have
be a mistake
i name be say
Uhmah aziz
i be a theoretical
physicist
i model space
i have
never be to basra
i be a teacher
i would like to be of assistance
but
i be afraid i can not help you

so you be not doctor Fallari

madam
i have never even hear of
this man

you be not lead engineer at the
osirak nuclear installation outside
tikrit
you be never capture by
the Mukhbarat escaping to syria
you do not spend three year in the
abu Dhan jail


this be absurd

you be not torture
break
you
do not finally escape and arrive
here in cairo with nothing

no

dr
al Fallari have two daughter
they be taken by Uday Husseins
private guard
he never see they
again

that do not happen
they never
exist

i need name
of you colleague in
the weapon programme
the live
of hundreds of thousands of you
people may depend upon it

i know Tarif
i know what happen

you know nothing



they be back

the iraqi be trying to buy the
tube off the internet
they spent
three million dollar weather
proof the tube
plus the tube
be roughly twice too long
now you
could argue that that be to disguise
they you could see they in half
that be sixty thousand tube
i mean whew
Saddams going to get the
mother of all blister

how be it

do not make joke


he think i do not know how serious
it be
week and week of fifteen
hour day we have go back over and
over it


i will handle this


and so apart from all the
scepticism surrounding the
specification the analysis from
the which i believe be
numbered in the report
stop
change tack
mr libby
energy department nuclear
scientist be among the most
bore people on the planet
they
can talk about gas centrifuge
until you want to jump out of a
window
and maybe once every ten
year someone come along and say
so tell i about gas
centrifuge
that be literally the
only time you should listen to
these guy
if they say an
aluminium tube be not for a gas
centrifuge it be like a fish talking
about water
we have be over this
data with you now five six time
and
we do not really know how you
want we to play this

let i level with you here paul
i
do not know what these tube be
for
from everything you be saying
there could be something to this
but very likely not right

exactly

may i ask a question
when you say
we do not really know how to play
this what do you mean


stop
turn white
i be just saying i do not know how to
say it any other way than that

except you do not say i you said
we
so you and the other have
discuss how to play these
briefing
why do the feel
the need to play these briefing

no
i mean that
ok
i do not mean
what i just said

which part
the last part
or other
thing too

i be a get a little confuse

you want i to come back

no
no

you do not know why i be here do you
in the united states invaded
iraq and afterwards weapon
inspector discovered saddam be
six month off enriching uranium to
sufficiently high specification to
make a nuclear bomb
he have fissile
material
and not a single person
at the from the down to
the janitor have the slight clue
that such a program even exist
so now one decade on be you
telling i that you be sure
these tube be not intended to
create nuclear weapon

i
sir

with intelligence
nothing percent


so
what
be you
ninety nine
percent sure
ninety eight

you can not put an exact figure
you
can not be that precise

but if you have to say could you
say you be ninety seven percent
sure
be there a three percent
chance you have get this wrong
or
four
or five
still pretty good

we read in the new york time today
a story that say that saddam
hussein be close to acquire
nuclear weapon

we do know that he be actively
pursue a nuclear weapon
that
there have be shipment into iraq
of highquality aluminum tube that
be only really suited for nuclear
weapon program centrifuge
program


and as we see in reporting just
this morning he be still trying to
acquire some of the specialize
aluminum tubing one need to
develop centrifuge that would give
you an enrichment capability


aluminium tube

specifically aluminum tube
there be a story in the new york
time this morning
i want to
attribute the time
i do not want
to talk about specific intelligence
source but it be now public that he
have be seeking to acquire the
kind of tube that be necessary
to build a centrifuge



it be a coordinate leak


someone in the leak to the
new york time and now they be
across the network quoting the
leak
smoke gun
mushroom
cloud
they be use the same
word
it be coordinate

i be coming home


be Iraqs regime of saddam hussein
right now a clear and present
danger to the united states

there be no doubt that saddam
Husseins regime be a danger to the
united states and to it ally to
we interest
the problem here be
that there will always be some
uncertainty about how quickly he
can acquire nuclear weapon
but we
do not want the smoke gun to be a
mushroom cloud


number one i always open the
window and close the door


you can still smell it

you want i to roll up a wet towel
like a teenager smoking in his
bedroom

see
during a particularly vicious
period of bloodlet in the late
eighties saddam be ask by his
foreign minister why he have
executed a certain official who have
be a loyal supporter
he said he
would rather kill a friend in error
than allow an enemy to live
for
i that be the mark of a monster

the senate intelligence committee
publish information that show
joe wilson have lie about how he
come to be send to niger
he
denied that he wife have any role
in it whatsoever but a memo Plame
write on february prove
otherwise


the senate intelligence committee
let some air a lot of air out
of joe wilsons overly inflate ego
when it issued it first report on
prewar intelligence
while the
committee heaped most of it
criticism on the central
intelligence agency for get
almost everything wrong about iraq
and weapon of mass destruction it
pointedly rebuke the former
ambassador and he infamous mission
to niger

mr wilson do you still maintain
the vice president office send
you niger and not you wife

mr wilson be niger just a free
holiday
boondoggle

i wife do not send i
i do not
receive payment
it be not a
holiday
it be a fact find
mission in the run up to a war
but
the fact be no one wanted fact

be you against we troop mr
wilson

mr
wilson be it true you donate
money to the kerry campaign

people be saying you wife do
not actually work for the

be it true she be just a secretary
at langley


no comment

the question still remains who be
valerie Plame
be she really
simply a glorify typist

well i think it be really all about
the money
we be talking about a
thirdrate agent who have a
government salary and she have send
she husband to niger and he have
come back and do not give the
report to the but he turned it
over in an oped to the new york
time
so she be already in the
hot seat with the and so now
she be all about the money
plus
it be come out that she be
consider kind of a mediocre agent
at good

when we be at the farm
train to be field officer they

sandwich
to
avoid another punch

another hour in a stress position

they push you until they find it
til they find the point at which
you break

you have to know
and one by
one everybody broke
except i

counsel patrick fitzgerald decline
to comment about rove
involvement

ask about cheney he said
i be
not making allegation about anyone

officer valerie Plame


in a statement released friday
afternoon libby said i have
